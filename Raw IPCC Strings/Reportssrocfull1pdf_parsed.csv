properties of the substance itself but also upon the factors that
influence emissions to the atmosphere, such as containment,
recycling, destruction and energy efficiency in particular

The likelihood that CFCs and other ODSs also affect the
climate system was first identified in the 1970s, and the global
warming effectiveness of halocarbons, including HFCs, has been
further elucidated over the past three decades. For example, the
1989 Scientific Assessment of Stratospheric Ozone included a
chapter on halocarbon global warming potentials (GWPs) and
the 1989 Technology Assessment presented these GWPs in
discussions of the importance of energy efficiency in insulating
foam, refrigeration, and air conditioning. As various approaches
were developed to the phase-out of ODSs under the Montreal
Protocol, it was realized that some actions taken to reduce future
depletion of the ozone layer, in particular the introduction of
HFCs and PFCs, could increase or decrease global warming
impact.

"Scientific evidence linking chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and
other Ozone Depleting Substances (ODSs) to global ozone
depletion led to the initial control of chemicals under the 1987
Montreal Protocol and to Amendments and Adjustments in
the 1990s that added additional ODSs, agreed phaseouts, and
accelerated those phaseouts. This international process has
resulted in (i) elimination of production of most CFCs, methyl
chloroform, and halons, (ii) the increased use of existing
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), (iii) the new production
of a wide range of industrial fluorine containing chemicals,
including new types of HCFCs, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and
perfluorocarbons (PFCs), (iv) use of non-halogenated chemical
substitutes such as hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and ammonia
and (v) the development of not-in-kind alternative methods
such as water-based cleaning procedures.

"This scientific and technical information allowed Parties to the
Montreal Protocol to choose options to replace ODSs, mindful
of the global warming impact and was reflected in some
investment decisions under the Montreal Protocol Multilateral
Fund. When the Kyoto Protocol was negotiated in 1997,
countries had new incentives to take account of how choices
among substitutes could affect the objectives of both protocols.
These considerations created a need for more comprehensive
information regarding options for ODS replacement that take
into account the need of safeguarding the ozone layer as well
as the global climate system. In May 1999, the IPCC and
TEAP held a joint expert meeting on options for the limitation
of Emissions of HFCs and PFCs and in October 1999 TEAP
published its report: “The implications to the Montreal Protocol
of the Inclusion of HFCs and PFCs in the Kyoto Protocol”. This
Special Report of 2005 is the latest cooperative effort.

global climate modelling and statistical studies suggest that
ozone depletion is one mechanism that may affect patterns

7 Radiative forcing is a measure of the influence a factor has in altering the balance of incoming and outgoing energy in the Earth-atmosphere system, and is

an index of the importance of the factor as a potential climate change mechanism. It is expressed in watts per square meter (W m’”). A greenhouse gas causes
direct radiative forcing through absorption and emission of radiation and may cause indirect radiative forcing through chemical interactions that influence other
greenhouse gases or particles.

"Observations and model calculations suggest that the
global average amount of ozone depletion has now
approximately stabilized (for example, see Figure
SPM-3). Although considerable variability in ozone is
expected from year to year, including in polar regions

where depletion is largest, the ozone layer is expected to
begin to recover in coming decades due to declining ODS
concentrations, assuming full compliance with the Montreal
Protocol. [1.2 and 1.4]

"Each type of gas has had different greenhouse warming
and ozone depletion effects (see Figure SPM-2) depending
mainly on its historic emissions, effectiveness as a
greenhouse gas, lifetime and the amount of chlorine and/
or bromine in each molecule. Bromine-containing gases
currently contribute much more to cooling than to warming,
whereas CFCs and HCFCs contribute more to warming than
to cooling. HFCs and PFCs contribute only to warming. [1.5

"Actions taken under the Montreal Protocol have led to
the replacement of CFCs with HCFCs, HFCs, and other
substances and processes. Because replacement species
generally have lower global warming potentials’! (GWPs),
and because total halocarbon emissions have decreased,
their combined CO,-equivalent (direct GWP-weighted)
emission has been reduced. The combined CO,-equivalent
emissions of CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs derived from
atmospheric observations decreased from about 7.5 + 0.4
GtCO,-eq per year around 1990 to 2.5 + 0.2 GtCO,-eq

per year around 2000, equivalent to about 33% and 10%,
respectively, of the annual CO, emissions due to global fossil
fuel burning. Stratospheric chlorine levels have approximately
stabilized and may have already started to decline. [1.2, 2.3

"Based on the Business-As-Usual scenario developed in
this report, the estimated direct radiative forcing of HFCs
in 2015 is about 0.030 W m~; based on scenarios from
the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES),
the radiative forcing of PFCs’ in 2015 is about 0.006

W m”. Those HFC and PFC radiative forcings correspond to
about 1.0% and 0.2%, respectively, of the estimated radiative
forcing of all well-mixed greenhouse gases in 2015, with the
contribution of ODSs being about 10%. While this report
particularly focused on scenarios for the period up to 2015,
for the period beyond 2015 the IPCC SRES scenarios were
considered but were not re-assessed. These SRES scenarios
project significant growth in radiative forcing from HFCs
over the following decades, but the estimates are likely to be
very uncertain due to growing uncertainties in technological
practices and policies. [1.5, 2.5 and 11.5]

"Substitution for ODSs in air conditioning, refrigeration,
and foam blowing by HFCs, PFCs, and other gases such as
hydrocarbons are not expected to have a significant effect
on global tropospheric chemistry. Small but not negligible
impacts on air quality could occur near localized emission
sources and such impacts may be of some concern, for

"Persistent degradation products (such as trifluoroacetic
acid, TFA) of HFCs and HCFCs are removed from

the atmosphere via deposition and washout processes.
However, existing environmental risk assessment and
monitoring studies indicate that these are not expected to
result in environmental concentrations capable of causing
significant ecosystem damage. Measurements of TFA in
sea water indicate that the anthropogenic sources of TFA are
smaller than natural sources, but the natural sources are not

fully identified. [2.4]

"Over the long term, projected increases in other
greenhouse gases could increasingly influence the

ozone layer by cooling the stratosphere and changing
stratospheric circulation. As a result of the cooling effect and
of reducing ODS concentrations, ozone is likely to increase
over much of the stratosphere, but could decrease in some
regions, including the Arctic. However, the effects of changes
in atmospheric circulation associated with climate change
could be larger than these factors, and the net impact on
total ozone due to increases in atmospheric concentrations
of greenhouse gases is currently uncertain in both magnitude
and sign. Based on current models an Arctic ‘ozone hole’
similar to that presently observed over the Antarctic is very

The most accurate estimates of emissions of CFC-11 and
CFC-12 are derived from observations of atmospheric
concentrations. Those emissions are now larger than estimated
releases related to current production, indicating that a
substantial fraction of these emissions come from banks built
up through past production. Observations of atmospheric
concentrations show that global emissions of HFC-134a are
presently smaller than reported production, implying that
this bank is growing. The total global amount of HFC-134a
currently in the atmosphere is believed to be about equal to
the amount in banks. [2.5 and 11.3.4]

stated otherwise, the most recent scientific values for the GWPs are used, as assessed in this report and as presented in Table SPM-1 (Column for ‘GWP for direct

with others planned; the few plants for other HFCs are
almost exclusively in developed countries. The proposed
European Community phase-out of HFC-134a in mobile
air conditioners in new cars and the industry voluntary
programme to reduce their HFC-134a emissions by 50% will
affect demand and production capacity and output. Rapidly
expanding markets in developing countries, in particular

for replacements for CFCs, is resulting in new capacity for
fluorinated gases which is at present being satisfied through
the expansion of HCFC-22 and 141b capacity. [11]

"This IPCC Special Report was developed in response to
invitations by the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC) 12 and the Montreal Protocol on
Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer’ to prepare a balanced
scientific, technical and policy relevant report regarding
alternatives to ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) that affect
the global climate system. It has been prepared by the IPCC
and the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel (TEAP)
of the Montreal Protocol.

"Because ODSs cause depletion of the stratospheric ozone
layer‘, their production and consumption are controlled
under the Montreal Protocol and consequently are being
phased out, with efforts made by both developed and
developing country parties to the Montreal Protocol. Both the
ODSs and a number of their substitutes are greenhouse gases
(GHGs) which contribute to climate change (see Figure
TS-1). Some ODS substitutes, in particular
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs), are
covered under the TINECCC and ite Kvara Prataco! Ontiane

climate change and are among possible non-ozone depleting alternatives for ODSs. Red denotes gases included under the Montreal Protocol and
its amendments and adjustments’ while green denotes those included under the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol. Options considered in this
report for reducing halocarbon emissions include improved containment, recovery, recycling, destruction of byproducts and existing banks®, and

7 Tt should be noted that the National Inventory Reporting community uses the term ‘indirect emissions’ to refer specifically to those greenhouse gas emissions
which arise from the breakdown of another substance in the environment. This is in contrast to the use of the term in this report, which specifically refers to
energy-related CO, emissions associated with Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approaches such as Total Equivalent Warming Impact (TEWI) or Life Cycle Climate
Performance (LCCP).
"	Text
"With regard to specific emission reduction options, the
report generally limits its coverage to the period up to 2015,
for which reliable literature is available on replacement
options with significant market potential for these rapidly
evolving sectors. Technical performance, potential assessment
methodologies and indirect emissions’ related to energy use
are considered, as well as costs, human health and safety,
implications for air quality, and future availability issues.
"	Text
"The major application sectors using ODSs and their HFC/
PEC substitutes include refrigeration, air conditioning, foams,
aerosols, fire protection and solvents. Emissions of these
substances originate from manufacture and any unintended
byproduct releases, intentionally emissive applications,
evaporation and leakage from banks contained in equipment
and products during use, testing and maintenance, and end-
of-life practices.
"	Text
"The report considers, by sector, options for reducing
halocarbon emissions, options involving alternative
substances, and technologies, to address greenhouse gas
emissions reduction. It considers HFC and PFC emissions
insofar as these relate to replacement of ODSs. HFC and
PFC emissions from aluminum or semiconductor production
or other sectors where ODS replacement is not involved are
not covered.
"	Text
"The second part assesses options to replace ODSs, including
environmental, health, safety, availability and technical
performance issues (section 3 and 4 of the TS). The report
assesses practices and alternative technologies to reduce
emissions and net warming impacts within each use

sector, including consideration of process improvement in
applications, improved containment, end-of-life recovery,
recycling, disposal and destruction as well as relevant policies
and measures.
"	Text
"Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) have been used to
replace chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in several applications

as they have shorter lifetimes in the atmosphere and
consequently cause less ozone depletion. HFCs and PFCs
have been identified as potential long-term replacements for
ODSs because they contain neither bromine nor chlorine
and do not cause any significant ozone depletion. However,
all of these species are also GHGs and so contribute to
climate change in varying degrees. Additional alternatives for
halocarbon use include ammonia and organic substances, the
direct emissions of which have a very small effect on climate
although indirect emissions may be important.
"	Text
"The Technical Summary (TS) brings together key information
from the underlying report and follows to some extent

the report structure, which is in three parts. The first part
describes scientific links between stratospheric ozone depletion
and climate change and provides relevant information on
radiative forcing, observations of changes in forcing agents
and emissions (section 2 of the TS). It addresses how the
phase-out of ODSs is affecting both stratospheric ozone

and climate change as well as the implications for air quality
and local environmental issues. The report does not seek to
cover the breadth and depth of other specialized assessments
of ozone depletion and climate change, but rather to assess
relevant interactions between the two environmental issues
pertinent to the consideration of replacement options.

"The primary radiative effect of CO, and water vapour is to
warm the surface climate but cool the stratosphere. However,
due to their absorption in the atmospheric window, the

troposphere and stratosphere. [1.2 and Box 1.4]
"	Text
" 

® Radiative forcing is a measure of the influence a factor has in altering the balance of incoming and outgoing energy in the Earth-atmosphere system, and is

an index of the importance of the factor as a potential climate change mechanism. It is expressed in watts per square meter (W mr). A greenhouse gas causes
direct radiative forcing through absorption and emission of radiation and may cause indirect radiative forcing through chemical interactions that influence other
greenhouse gases or particles.

"	Text
"Radiative efficiencies (W m~ ppb"") for the halocarbons and
other well-mixed GHGs that are reported under the Montreal
and Kyoto Protocols are given in Table TS-1. For most of

the species considered here, the magnitude of the direct
radiative forcing generated bya gas is given by the product

of its mixing ratio (in parts per billion, ppb) and radiative
efficiency. For the more abundant greenhouse gases - CO,,
methane and nitrous oxide — there is a nonlinear relationship
between mixing ratio and radiative forcing. [1.1]
"	Text
"Many halocarbons, including CFCs, PFCs, HFCs and
HCFCs, are effective GHGs because they absorb Earth’s
outgoing infrared radiation in a spectral range where energy
is not removed by CO, or water vapour (sometimes referred
to as the atmospheric window, see Figure TS-2). Halocarbon
molecules can be many thousand times more efficient at
absorbing radiant energy emitted from the Earth than a
molecule of CO, , and small amounts of these gases can
contribute significantly to radiative forcing® of the climate

system. (1.1)?

"Notes

* The radiative efficiency of CO, decreases as its concentration increases.

» Removal of CO, from the atmosphere involves many different processes and its rate cannot be expressed accurately with a single lifetime. However, carbon
cycle models typically estimate that 30 to 50% of CO, emissions remain in the atmosphere for more than 100 years.

© The lifetimes of CH, and N,O incorporate indirect effects of the emission of each gas on its own lifetime.
"	Text
"Apart from their direct effect on climate, some gases have

an indirect effect either from radiative forcing caused by
their degradation products or through their influences on
atmospheric chemistry. Halocarbons containing chlorine and
bromine are ODSs and, because ozone is a strong absorber
of UV radiation, they have an indirect cooling effect which
is significant compared to their direct warming effect. For
hydrocarbons, indirect effects associated with tropospheric
ozone production may be significantly greater than direct

effects. [1.1, 1.5, Box 1.3, 2.2 and 2.5]

"Currently observed rates of change differ among ODSs,
depending mainly upon their emissions and atmospheric
lifetimes (see Table TS-2). Following the Montreal Protocol
and its subsequent amendments, large reductions in ODS
production and emission have occurred. The concentrations
of some CFCs have peaked, while others are expected to
decline in the future. In the complete absence of emissions,
the concentrations of these gases would decrease, but at a
slow rate that is determined by their atmospheric lifetimes

of decades to centuries. Continuing emissions will cause
increases in the concentrations of these gases or diminish
their rates of decrease. Observations of annual changes

in atmospheric concentrations provide the most reliable
estimates of total global emissions for long-lived gases. For
example, CFC-11 is observed to be decreasing at a rate about
60% slower than would occur in the absence of emissions,
while CFC-12 is still increasing slightly, indicating continuing
emissions of both species. CFC-113, however, is decreasing
at a rate close to that expected in the absence of emissions.
Table TS-2 shows observed global concentrations and growth
or decay rates of the major CFCs, halons, HCFCs, HFCs
and PFCs, together with the estimated emissions to the
atmosphere required to explain currently observed trends.

"Figure TS-4. Radiative forcing (W m™) due to changes in well
mixed GHGs and ozone over the time periods 1750 — 2000 and
1970 — 2000. The negative radiative forcing from stratospheric
ozone is due to stratospheric ozone depletion resulting from
halocarbon emissions between 1970 and 2000. In contrast, the
tropospheric ozone radiative forcing is largely independent of the
halocarbon radiative forcing. [Figure 1.3]

"Continuing atmospheric observations of CFCs and other
ODSs now enable improved validation of estimates for the
lag between production and emission to the atmosphere. This
provides new insight into the overall significance of banks and
of end-of-life options which are relevant to the future use of
HCFC and HFC substitutes. [2.5]
"	Text
"For some gases, there are now sufficient atmospheric
observations to constrain not just global but also regional
emissions in certain areas. For example, atmospheric
measurements suggest sharp increases in European emissions
of HFC-134a over the period 1995-1998 and in HFC-152a
over the period 1996-2000, with some subsequent levelling
off through to 2003. [2.3]
"	Text
"For comparison, earlier estimates of emissions (WMO,
2003)!° are also shown for the year 1990, which is slightly
after the peak in ODS emissions. Emissions of CFC-113
and CH,CCL,, both used largely as solvents and having
no accumulated banks, decreased by more than a factor of
10 from 1990 to 2000. Stratospheric chlorine levels have
approximately stabilized and may have already started to

decline. [2.3]
"	Text
"Because increases in halocarbon concentrations occurred
mainly during the last three decades, their relative
contribution to total radiative forcing is larger during this
period. The direct radiative forcing due to increases in
halocarbons from 1970 to 2000 was 0.27 + 0.03 W m®,
which represents about 23% of that due to increases in all of
the well-mixed GHGs. The contribution to direct radiative
forcing due to HCFCs is presently dominated by HCFC-22,
while that due to HFCs is dominated by HFC-134a and
HEC-23, with the latter being emitted mainly asa byproduct
of manufacture of HCFC-22. [1.1, 1.5]
"	Text
"The estimated current emissions of CFC-11 and CFC-12
shown in Table TS-2 are larger than estimates of new
production, indicating that a substantial fraction of these
emissions originates from banks of these chemicals built

up from past production. Such banks include material
contained in foams, air conditioning, refrigeration and other
applications. In contrast, production is currently greater than
emission for nearly all of the HCFCs and HFCs, implying
that banks of these chemicals are currently accumulating and
could contribute to future radiative forcing. One measure of
the relevance of such banks is the ratio of bank size to the
amount already in the atmosphere. For example, in the case
of HFC-134a these amounts are estimated to be about equal.

"As shown in Figure TS-5, the amount of stratospheric ozone
has decreased over the past few decades, particularly in

the Antarctic. The largest decreases since 1980 have been
observed over the Antarctic during the spring (the Antarctic
ozone hole), with the monthly total column ozone amounts
in September and October being about 40-50% below pre-
ozone-hole values. [1.2, 1.3 and 1.4]

"Arctic ozone loss in any given year depends strongly on the
meteorological conditions. Arctic ozone has been chemically
depleted by up to 30% in recent cold years, but the losses
observed in warm years have been very small. Globally
averaged ozone has decreased by roughly 3% since 1980.
The ozone column decreased by about 6% over the mid-
latitudes (35°-G60°) in the Southern Hemisphere and 3% in
the Northern Hemisphere. Significant long-term changes
in column ozone have not been observed in the tropics.
Observations and model calculations suggest that the global
average amount of ozone depletion has now approximately

stabilized (see Figure TS-5). [1.2]
"	Text
"The observed ozone changes are caused by both chemical and
dynamical factors, with the chemical factors being dominant.
This ozone depletion is caused primarily by increases in
concentrations of reactive chlorine and bromine compounds
that are produced by degradation of anthropogenic ODSs,
including halons, CFCs, HCFCs, methyl chloroform
(CH,CCL,), carbon tetrachloride (CCl,) and methyl bromide
(CH,Br). Human activities have increased the amount of
chlorine in the stratosphere, relative to estimated natural
background levels, by a factor of about 5 since 1970. CFCs
are the primary source of this change, while HCFCs currently

contribute about 5% to the total stratospheric chlorine
loading. [1.2, 1.3 and 1.4]
"	Text
"Observations and modelling show that ozone depletion has
acted to cool the stratosphere, which in turn can contribute
to cooling of the troposphere and surface. The warming of
the climate by ODSs and the cooling associated with ozone
depletion are two distinct mechanisms that are governed. by
different physical processes and feedbacks and for which there
are quite different levels of scientific understanding. For the
purposes of this report, we follow IPCC (2001)!! and assume
that the observed depletion is caused entirely by ODSs and
that the ozone radiative forcing can be considered to be an
indirect effect due to ODSs. Gases containing bromine (such
as halons) are particularly effective ozone depleters and have

a larger contribution to the indirect effect on a per-molecule
basis than other ozone-depleting gases such as the CFCs. [1.1,

While this is expected to be the dominant factor in ozone

stratospheric chemistry and climate, and will have some effect

on ozone recovery. [1.3 and 1.4]

stratospheric ozone for the latitude range 60°S-60°N from
two-dimensional photochemical models together with
comparable ground-based and satellite measurements taken

recovery occurring gradually as halogen gas emissions and
concentrations decrease. However, the time of recovery varies
significantly, depending on assumptions made about future
climate and future composition of the atmosphere, and
consequently remains quite uncertain. [1.4 and Box 1.7]

"A limited number of global climate modelling and statistical
studies suggest that ozone depletion is one mechanism

that may affect patterns of climate variability which are
important for tropospheric circulation and temperatures in
both hemispheres. In particular, the significant depletion of
stratospheric ozone occurring in the Antarctic region is likely
to have affected stratospheric circulation, and consequently
the troposphere. There are indications that the Antarctic
ozone hole has contributed to the cooling observed over

the Antarctic plateau and to warming in the region of the
Antarctic Peninsula. [1.3]
"	Text
"Future temperature changes related to GHG emissions

are expected to enhance stratospheric ozone depletion in
some parts of the stratosphere and decrease it in others.
Increases in CO, concentration are expected to cool the
stratosphere, which is known to reduce the rates of gas-
phase ozone destruction in much of the stratosphere and
thereby increase ozone concentrations at altitudes above
about 25 km. In contrast, lower temperatures could decrease
ozone concentrations at lower altitudes. While the latter
effect is expected to be most important in the Arctic in late
winter to early spring, it may be small compared with other

determined by the range of model estimates and arises mainly
because of uncertainties in the detailed vertical distribution
of ozone depletion. This indirect effect is very likely’ to be
smaller in magnitude than the positive direct radiative forcing
due to ODSs alone (0.32 + 0.03 W m~ ) which is far better
understood . If some fraction of the observed global ozone

"As can be seen from the measurements shown in Figure

"Figure TS-8 shows estimates of the separate contributions to
future halocarbon radiative forcing from: past emissions (i.e.
what is currently in the atmosphere); future emissions of new
production assuming no change in current practices (based on
the WMO Ab scenario); and emissions from current banks of
halocarbons. Two different estimates of this last component
are shown, one based on the WMO (2003) Ozone Assessment
and the other based on later sections of this report. Although
the magnitude of current ODS banks remains uncertain, their
contribution to radiative forcing is expected to be comparable
with that of HFC emissions to the atmosphere in the next few
decades. This indicates that choices with respect to end-of-life
options, such as the destruction of currently banked material,
can provide significant benefits for the climate system. End-
of-life recovery, recycling and destruction practices could also
reduce emissions of all newly produced halocarbons and their
contribution to radiative forcing shown in Figure TS-8. [1.5]

generally have lower global warming potentials (GWPs) and
because total halocarbon emissions have been reduced. The
reduction can be seen by comparing emissions in 1990 and

Figure TS-9. Thus the combined CO,-equivalent emissions of

"The choice of time horizon is a policy consideration and
makes a compromise between the relative weighting of short-
term and long-term effects. Current practice most often uses
GWPs calculated with a 100-year time horizon. This does
not take into account the full effect of very long-lived gases
with high radiative efficiency, such as PFCs, that persist in
the atmosphere for much longer than 100 years. Similarly,
integrating over 100 years reduces the contribution of short-
lived species that last for only part of that period, relative

to that of CO, which continues to contribute to radiative

"The indirect GWPs associated with ozone depletion caused
by the different ODSs are given in Table TS-3. As ODS
indirect cooling effects are projected to cease upon ozone

lifetime but also on the time of ozone recovery. Estimates of
indirect GWPs incorporate this latter dependence by setting
all indirect effects to zero after the time at which equivalent
effective stratospheric chlorine (EESC) is estimated to return
to its pre-1980 values. Indirect GWPs therefore depend on
the year of emission and have large uncertainties arising
from: uncertainty in the radiative forcing caused by ozone
depletion; uncertainties in the amount of EESC attributed
to each species; and uncertainty in the time at which EESC
returns to its pre-1980 values. [1.5 and 2.5]

concentrations as high as 40 ug L”' have been observed in
the Dead Sea and Nevada lakes, suggesting a linkage to salt
chemistry. Calculations based on projected HCFC and HFC
emissions suggest that the concentration of TFA in rain-water
due to their degradation is expected to be between 0.1

ug L"" and 0.5 wg L"" in the year 2010. Thus increases to
toxic levels of 1 mg L* in specific ecosystems resulting from
use of halocarbons are not supported by current studies. [2.4]

This concerns only emissions of HFCs and PFCs that result from their use as ODS-substitutes. Total emissions of HFCs and notably PFCs are higher because of

emissions from other applications that are not within the scope of this report (e.g. emissions from aluminum production and the semiconductor industry).

stated otherwise, the most recent scientific values for the GWPs are used, as assessed in this report and as presented in Table TS-3.

"Ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) and their substitutes

Many of these substances (or byproducts released during
manufacture) are greenhouse gases (GHGs), the emissions
of which will result in a contribution to the direct positive
forcing of the climate. Direct emissions of GHGs may occur
during the manufacture of these substances, during their

use in products and processes and at the end of the life of
these products (see Figure TS-1). Banks are the total amount
of substances contained in existing equipment, chemical
stockpiles, foams and other products, which are not yet
released to the atmosphere.

"The UNFCCC addresses anthropogenic emissions by

sources and the removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not
controlled by the Montreal Protocol, and its Kyoto protocol
regulates emissions of carbon dioxide (CO,), methane (CH,),
nitrous oxide (N,O), HFCs, PFCs and sulphur hexafluoride
(SF,). The Montreal Protocol, on the other hand, controls
not the emission but rather the production and consumption
of ODSs. Thus, the emissions due to releases of CFCs and
HCECs present in banks (e.g. refrigeration equipment, foams)
are not covered by either the Montreal Protocol or Climate
Convention and Kyoto Protocol. These emissions could make
a significant future contribution to global warming.

a steep increase in their use in (commercial) refrigeration

HFC emissions is the result of the increased application of
HECs in the refrigeration, SAC and MAC sectors and due to

In industrialized countries, the use and emissions of CFCs
and HCFCs will decline following the Montreal Protocol
phase-out requirement as obsolete equipment is retired. In
developing countries, the production of HCFCs can continue
until 2040, and significant increase in their production is
expected. These changes, and their impacts, are reflected in

the data in Table TS-4. [11.6]

"The decline in CFC emissions is not accompanied by a
similar increase in emissions of HFCs because of continuing
trends towards non-HFC technology and substitutes with
lower GWPs. In addition, but not included in the BAU
scenario, the capture and safe disposal of substances that
were emitted in the past are likely to increase with respect to
HFCs since these substances are controlled under the Kyoto
Protocol. The BAU case assumes the continuing application
of all existing measures, and the mitigation scenario embodies
improvements that could be implemented assuming global
application of current best-practice emission reduction
techniques.

GtCO,-eq in 2015. CFC banks associated with refrigeration,
SAC” and MAC equipment are expected to fall from about
6 GtCO,-eq in 2002 to 1 GtCO,-eq by 2015, mainly due
to release to the atmosphere and partly due to end-of-life
recovery and destruction. CFC banks in foams remain
significant (decreasing from 10 to 7 GtCO,-eq over the
same period). HCFC banks will increase from about 4 to

5 GtCO,-eq, primarily due to the projected increase of
HCEC-22 use in commercial refrigeration. Total HFC banks
will start to build up to 5 GtCO,-eq in 2015. HFC banks

"The literature does not allow for an estimate of overall
indirect GHG emissions related to energy consumption.

For individual applications, the relevance of indirect GHG
emissions over a life cycle can range from low to high, and
for certain applications may be up to an order of magnitude
larger than direct GHG emissions. This is highly dependent
on the specific sector and product/application characteristics,
the carbon-intensity of the consumed electricity and fuels
during the complete life cycle of the application, containment
during the use-phase and the end-of-life treatment of the
banked substances. Table TS-7 presents examples of the
ranges found in the literature with respect to the proportion
of direct emissions to total GHG emissions for applications
using HFCs. For applications using other substances, these
proportions may differ significantly. The relatively old
vintage stock of refrigeration equipment using CFCs may, in
particular, provide a larger share of direct emissions. [3.2, 4

comparison of atmospheric measurements with inventory
calculations shows differences per group of substances (CFCs,
HCFCs, HFCs and PFCs) in the order of 10-25%. For
individual gases, the differences can be much bigger. These
differences are caused by unidentified emissive applications of
some substances (e.g. CFC-11, HCEFC-141b, HCFC-142b)
that are not accounted for in inventory calculations and by
uncertainties in the geographically distributed data sets of
equipment in use. [11.3.4]

"Through global application of best practices and recovery
methods, about 1.2 GtCO,-eq yr of direct GHG emissions
can be reduced by 2015, as compared with the BAU scenario.
About 60% of this potential is HFC emission reduction;
HCEFCs and CFCs contribute about 30% and 10%,
respectively. Almost 75% of the reduction potential can be
found in the refrigeration, SAC and MAC sectors, and about
25% can be found in the destruction of HFC-23 byproduct
emissions from HCFC-22 production. This latter option
represents about 40% of the HFC-reduction potential. [11.6]

"Most indirect energy-related GHG emissions occur during
the use-phase of the applications and, in many cases, energy
efficiency improvements can result in significant reductions
in GHG emissions, particularly where the use-phase is long.
Energy efficiency improvements can be profitable and reduce
the net costs of the emission reduction options, although the
reduction potential is again highly dependent on the specific
circumstances. While the assessed literature did not allow
fora global estimate of this reduction potential, several case
studies at the technology and country level illustrate this
point.

"Reductions of indirect GHG emissions can be achieved by
improving the energy efficiency of products and processes
(and by reducing the specific GHG emissions of the energy
system). To determine which technology option has the
highest GHG emission reduction potential, both direct and
indirect emissions have to be assessed. The comparison of
technology options is not a straightforward exercise as even
within one technological application significant variations
in direct and indirect emissions may occur. Figure TS-10
shows the distribution of direct emissions from mobile

air conditioners in a fleet of passenger cars and of indirect
energy-related emissions from supermarket refrigerators.
The graphs show that even within a single technology class
considerable differences in potentials usually exist to reduce
direct and/or indirect emissions. The proper monitoring,

requires the selection of technologies which differ with respect
to their impacts on climate, on health, safety and other
environmental endpoints and on their private and social costs.
Analyses of these various impacts can assist decision-makers
to choose among competing replacement technologies.
However, the results of such analyses can vary, depending
upon which of the many factors that are not intrinsic to the
technologies are taken into consideration; these include the
analytical approach (e.g. top-down compared with bottom-
up), degree of product or process optimization, service and
disposal practices, regional circumstances and a wealth of
other inputs and assumptions. To make intelligent choices,
decision-makers must therefore be aware of the sensitivities,
uncertainties and limitations inherent in each type of analysis
and must also be able to evaluate whether the approach and

"Performance (LCCP, which also includes the direct GHG

that there is no scientifically established basis for reducing
multiple impact results (like LCA) to a single overall score or

"This report deals with direct emissions of halocarbons that are
associated with their production, use and decommissioning

as well as indirect emissions due to energy requirements.

Such emissions are quantified and costs associated with their
reduction are evaluated according to methodologies presented
herein. For a comprehensive assessment, not only private costs
need to be quantified: also external costs that are not paid by
the private sector but which are a burden to society should be
accounted for.
"	Text
"Any assessment of technical options to reduce the impacts
of emissions involves the evaluation of multiple factors.
These include the influence of direct and indirect emissions
on radiative forcing, costs, health, safety and environmental
impacts for each application and compound; service or
design practices that can lead to reduced leakage; the effects
of recovery and recycling. These factors may be subject to
large uncertainties and differ from application to application
and region to region. Non-technical factors also need to be
considered, such as differing regulatory and management
environments in different parts of the world, the availability
of infrastructure, investment financing and historical factors.
In many cases, only incomplete information on these factors
is available, thereby limiting the comprehensiveness of the
assessment.
"	Text
"In the past, little attention was paid to ensure the
comparability of results from different technology
assessments. There is a wide range of available results on
GHG performance from different assessments — often

not comparable. The treatment of uncertainties is often
incomplete, and resulting recommendations are not
sufficiently robust to be compared across sectors. In the

light of the many assumptions and different methodologies,
an important role has been identified for technology
comparisons under agreed conditions using a common set of
methods and assumptions. The development of simple and
pragmatic standard methodologies and their respective quality
criteria is recommended. Future work will need to bridge

the gap between the application of specific comparisons and
sufficiently robust results that can be used for policy design in
entire subsectors.
"	Text
"Analyses of sectoral and global emissions and emission
reduction potentials are based on extensive databases on
equipment populations and other product distributions
that comprise field data on substance emissions and

energy consumption. These databases should ideally be
consistent and compatible with national GHG emission
inventories. Information on fluid sales to the different
parties involved in the subsector will need to be made
available. The improvement of these fairly comprehensive
data sets for analysis in support of robust sectoral policies
requires significant resources and results in a number of
confidentiality issues which need to be addressed cautiously.
To achieve acceptability across subsectors with respect to
future developments, decision-makers could consider paying
special attention to increasing the involvement of relevant
stakeholders and to introducing additional measures in orde
to increase transparency for outside users through more
extensive documentation of methods and assumptions.

"Methodology to assess

Overview

 

Direct emissions
Production

Use

Decommissioning

1) Identification of all feedstock requirements and chemical processing stages necessary to
transform feedstock to intermediaries and final product.
2) Accounting for all emissions occurring at each stage through measurement and/or modelling.
1) Measurements to estimate losses of fluids during lifetime of equipment, which yield direct emissions.
2) Transportation and distribution losses are included as direct use emissions.
1) Emissions are accounted for based on the final destination of the products.
2) If no recovery, all remaining fluids are assumed to be direct emissions.
3) If recovered, emissions may also occur during fluid reprocessing.

 

Indirect emissions

 

Production

Use

Decommissioning

1) Modelling and/or measurement of built-in energy in equipment used for feedstock sourcing,
preprocessing, transport and transformation to final product in the plants.
2) Modelling and/or measurements of total energy consumption to produce one unit of a particular
fluid from feedstocks.
3) Relating energy consumption to emission of GHGs through region- or country-specific data.
1) Energy consumption evaluation during equipment lifetime.
a) Refrigeration, air conditioning and heating applications: modelling and/or measuring equipment
energy consumption.
b) Insulating foams:
b1) Thickness compensation modelling and/or
b2) measuring energy consumption for baseline and for foam insulated application.
2) Relating energy consumption to emission of GHGs through region- or country-specific data.
1) Energy consumption required for product recycling or destruction at end-of-life.
2) Relating energy consumption to emission of GHGs through region- or country-specific data.

 

Costs

 

Private costs

Social costs

Discount rates

Sustainable development

Costs are calculated based on expertise of private companies. These mainly include capital costs,

labour, land, materials, maintenance and administrative costs.

Costs usually charged to society, such as air and water pollution, associated with production of goods

by private sectors. Costs are estimated through the quantification of benefits and damages induced by
final product.

Use this to consider different time distribution of costs incurred. Present value or levelized cost is
evaluated taking into consideration market or social discount rates for private or social costs, respectively.
Quantification, or at least qualification, of positive and negative impacts caused on a society’s well-
being by changes in production and use of fluids.

 

Health and safety

 

Health and safety

1) Focus on risk assessment of chemicals and then minimising the negative health and safety impacts
through risk management of systems.
2) For relevant substances use the references to existing databases and data sources.

 

Environmental impacts

 

TEWI (Total Equivalent
Warming Impact) — Accounts for
GHGs from direct emissions of
operating fluids together with the
energy-related CO,

LCCP (Life Cycle Climate
Performance) — Accounts for
TEWI factors plus the fugitive
emissions arising during
manufacture (of the operating
fluids only) and the CO,
associated with their embodied
energy.

LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) —
Describes the environmental
impacts of product systems from
raw material acquisition to

final disposal

 

TEWI =3(a;*b; + a;*c,) + d

a, = GWP of gas i emitted;

b, = mass of gas i released during the operating lifetime of the system;

c,= mass of gas i released when the system is decommissioned at end-of-life;

d= emission of CO, resulting from the energy used to operate the system (for its entire lifetime).

LCCP = TEWI (calculated value as above described) + >x,*y, + z

x, = GWP of gas i emitted during the manufacture of fluid;

y,= mass of gas i released during the manufacture of fluid;

z= embodied energy of all material used for the manufacture of fluid (the specific energy used for
the manufacture of one unit mass of each material multiplied by the total mass emitted) expressed
in CO,-eq.

 

1) Describe the system in terms of its unit processes and their interrelationships.
2) Compile an inventory of relevant inputs and outputs of each unit process and of the systems
that are involved in those inputs and outputs (Life Cycle Inventory Analysis).
3) Evaluate potential environmental impacts of these inputs and outputs. The most obvious
environmental impact categories are climate change and ozone depletion, but some or all of the

terms per sector and per substance group are quantified in
Table TS-4. Table TS-9 summarizes the sector characteristics

"Difference in economic development is a very important
factor explaining regional differences in assessments. Key
assumptions on technical performance indicators, such as
equipment lifetime and operational cost of equipment and
products, vary greatly from developed to developing countries
in ways that seem to be related with the cost of capital.
"	Text
"The above challenges are compounded by the fact that each
technology that results in direct or indirect emissions has
unique data requirements for determining their climate

and ozone impacts. This situation raises issues of capacity,
standards, policy and regulation, for which developed
countries have established better, though not comprehensive,
frameworks within which to respond. This emphasizes the
need to develop simple, standard methodologies and the
respective quality criteria, as recommended in the report.

[3.6]
"	Text
"In developing countries, traditional private costs are usually
accounted for, while other hidden private costs (e.g. for
Research and Development (R&D), training, environmental
liability) are seldom considered. External costs are generally
poorly accounted for because there are usually no regulations
in place to deal with externality issues and the awareness
amongst the population is low. On-site health and safety
regulations are usually taken into consideration due to the
existence and enforcement of labour laws in most developing
countries.
"	Text
"Between developed and developing countries significant
variations can also be found with respect to the uncertainty
range of their emission estimates (both direct and indirect
emissions), which in turn are used as input for further
analysis. In the case of direct emissions, some progress

has been made in the diffusion of emission inventory
methodologies under the Montreal Protocol Multilateral
Fund investments in developing countries. However, for
both developed and developing countries, uncertainties are
generally significant. Improving the quantification of indirect
GHG emissions, which are significant relative to total GHG
emissions, remains a challenge for all countries. Difficulties
centre around such issues as data availability on energy
consumption, determination of the carbon intensity of the
energy consumed and the GHG emission estimates related to
the embodied energy in production inputs. These challenges
point to the necessity for a concerted global effort if decision-
makers are to be provided with the information needed to
make decisions supportive of global ozone layer and climate
policies.

"As discussed in the IPCC Third Assessment Report, a wide

range of policies, measures and instruments can be used to
reduce GHG emissions. These include:

 

 
"	Text
"3.8 What can be said about the future
availability of HFCs/PFCs for use in
developing countries?
"	Title
"3.7 Which policy instruments are available
to achieve the reductions in the
emissions of GHGs addressed in this
report?
"	Title
"No published data are available to project future production
capacity. However, as there are no technical or legal limits

to HFC and PFC production, it can be assumed that the
global production capacity will generally continue to satisfy or
exceed demand. Future production is therefore estimated in
this report by aggregating sectoral demand.
"	Text
"ee RO ODODE IID NIE III

* regulations (e.g. mandatory technology and performance
standards; product bans);

* financial incentives (e.g. taxes on emissions, production,
import or consumption; subsidies and direct government
spending and investment; deposit-refund systems; tradable
and non-tradable permits);

* voluntary agreements.
"	List
"Almost all of the policy instrument categories mentioned
above have been considered for, or implemented in, reducing
the use or emissions of ODSs and their substitutes, such as
HFCs and PFCs. Furthermore, general energy or climate
policies affect the indirect GHG emissions of applications
with ODSs, their substitutes or not-in-kind alternatives. In
addition, specific policies for reducing the GHG emissions of
ODS substitutes (i.e. HFCs and PFCs) have been formulated.
Examples are given in Table TS-10.
"	Text
"In the BAU scenario, global production capacity is expected
to expand with additions taking place mainly in developing
countries and through joint ventures. Global production
capacity of HFCs and PFCs most often exceeds current
demand. There are a number of HFC-134a plants in
developed countries and one plant in a developing country
with others planned; the few plants for other HFCs are
almost exclusively in developed countries. The proposed
European Community phase-out of HFC-134a in mobile
air conditioners in new cars and the industry voluntary
programme to reduce their HFC-134a emissions by 50% will
affect demand and production capacity and output. Rapidly
expanding markets in developing countries, in particular

for replacements for CFCs, is resulting in new capacity for
fluorinated gases which is at present being satisfied through
the expansion of HCFC-22 and 141b capacity. [11]

"Domestic refrigerators and freezers are used for food storage
in dwelling units and in non-commercial areas such as

offices throughout the world. More than 80 million units are
produced annually with internal storage capacities ranging
from 20 litres to more than 850 litres. With an estimated
unit average lifespan of 20 years, this results in an installed
inventory of approximately 1500 million units. As a result of
the Montreal Protocol, manufacturers initiated the transition
from CFC refrigerant applications during the early 1990s.
This transition is complete in developed countries and has
made significant progress in developing countries. However,
the typical lifespan of domestic refrigerators results in units
manufactured using CFC-12 refrigerant still comprising the
majority of the installed base. This in turn significantly retards
the rate of reduction in the demand for CFC-12 refrigerant in
the servicing sector.
"	Text
"Isobutane (HC-G600a) and HFC-134a are the major
alternative refrigerants replacing CFC-12 in new domestic
refrigeration equipment (see Table TS-12). Each of these has
demonstrated mass production capability for safe, efficient,
reliable and economic use. Similar product efficiencies result
from the use of either refrigerant. Independent studies have
concluded that application design parameters introduce
more efficiency variation than is presented by the refrigerant
choice. Comprehensive refrigerant selection criteria include
safety, environmental, functional, cost and performance
requirements. The choice of refrigerant can be strongly
influenced by local regulatory and litigation environments.
Each refrigerator typically contains 50-250 g of refrigerant
enclosed in a factory-sealed hermetic system. A simplified
summary of relative technical considerations for these two
refrigerants is:
"	Text
"* HC-600a uses historically familiar mineral oil as the
lubricant in the hermetic system. Manufacturing processes
and designs must properly deal with the flammable
nature of this refrigerant. Among these are the need
for proper factory ventilation and appropriate electrical
equipment, prevention of refrigerant leakage and access
to electrical components, use of sealed or non-sparking
electrical components when there is accessibility to leaking
refrigerant and the use of proper brazing techniques or,
preferably, avoidance of brazing operations on charged
systems. Field service procedures must also properly
accommodate the refrigerant flammability.

¢ HFC-134a uses moisture-sensitive polyolester oil as the
lubricant in the hermetic system. Manufacturing processes
and service procedures must take care to properly maintain
low moisture levels. Long-term reliability requires a more
careful avoidance of contaminants during production
or servicing compared to either CFC-12 or HC-600a
practices.

cycles, with evaporator temperatures ranging from 15°C
down to -70°C. Cryogenic applications operate at even lower
temperatures. The capacity of the units varies from 25 kW

to 30 MW, with systems often custom-made and erected on-
site. The refrigerants used are preferably single component

or azeotropes because many of the systems use flooded
evaporators to achieve high efficiency. Some designs use
indirect systems with heat transfer fluids to reduce refrigerant

operating pressures and results in low operating efficiencies,
thereby contributing to increased indirect CO, emissions
through higher energy consumption. Actual system tests of

northern Europe. This is a small number compared with the
installed base of more than 77,000 HCFC and HFC chillers

and/or gas-tight enclosure of the chiller, application of the
low-charge system design, fail-safe ventilation systems, and gas

"HFC-152a has also been successfully demonstrated in

MAC systems. While HFC-152a systems can use the same
components as HEC-134a systems, the former require an
added safety system because HFC-152a is flammable while
HFC-134a is non-flammable. Direct emissions (in CO,-
equivalents) are very low (92% reduction, referred to as the
HFC-134a baseline). HFC-152a systems have so far shown
an energy efficiency comparable with or better than improved
HFC-134a systems, but the energy gain could be lost if a
secondary loop system required by safety considerations is
used. However, its overall climate impact, expressed in TEWI,
is still significantly lower than that of HFC-134a and in

the same order of magnitude of CO, systems. The principle
barriers to commercialization at the present time are the
resolution of the flammability risk and the assurance of a
commercial global availability of HFC-152a.

"MAC systems using CO, have been successfully demonstrated
in passenger vehicles and commercial buses. CO, has a
GWP that is 1300-fold smaller than HFC-134a, thereby
limiting the direct effects per charge. However, Co, systems
operate at pressures about eightfold higher than those of
CFC-12 and HFC-134a (discharge pressures in the order of
12 MPa), and since leak flow rates are related to the square
of the pressure, CO, systems imply a much more difficult
containment. To date, CO, systems have shown an energy
efficiency comparable to or better than improved HFC-134a
systems in cooler ambient climates, but they are likely to be
less efficient in warmer climates. Nevertheless, as indicated
in Table TS-17, due to its nearly negligible direct effect, the
TEWI of CO, systems is significantly better than that of
improved HFC-134a systems. Barriers to commercialization
include the resolution of additional costs and safety issues
associated with the release of CO, within the passenger cabin
and maintenance issues as well as the conversion cost of the

"Lowest GWT selection

Since the two prime liquid HFCs (HFC-245fa and HFC-
365mfc) have similar 100-year GWPs, the choice between
the two has been driven more by a consideration of respective
boiling points and blowing efficiencies. For gaseous blowing
agents, HFC-152a has a much lower 100-year GWP than
HFC-134a. However, HFC-152a is more flammable than
HFC-134a and is also emitted much faster from some types
of foam (e.g. extruded polystyrene). This can mean that short-
term impacts of HFC-152a use can be as significant as those
of HFC-134a. In addition, the thermal insulating benefit

of HFC-152a can be short-lived. All of these factors have to
be evaluated during the selection of the appropriate blowing
agent.
"	Text
"Hlammability (product and process

The overall flammability of a foam product is influenced by
the choice of polymeric matrix and facing material as well

by the choice of blowing agent. However, it is often the

case that the contribution of the blowing agent can shift

the classification of a product or can change the attitude of
insurers to the risk posed. In addition, the handling of certain
flammable blowing agents can create fundamental challenges
in some foam processes. This is particularly the case for small
and medium enterprises (SMEs), for which economies of
scale do not exist and discontinuous processes dominate. In
the case of flammable blowing agents, investment criteria vary
considerably depending on whether the investment relates to
a new plant or modification of an existing plant. In the latter
case, costs can often be prohibitive if the plant is old or if it

is owned by a small or medium enterprise. Employer liability
issues can also be a cause for concern in some regions with a
strong litigious heritage.

"When the three aspects presented above are taken into
consideration, HFCs emerge as the preferred option in
several key sectors, although the progress made in developing
alternative technologies has ensured that uptake has been
constrained. An example of this is the continuing extension of
the application of hydrocarbon technologies. However, even in
cases where HFCs have been adopted, there are two additional
points to consider:

(1) How much HFC is required in the formulation to

achieve the required performance?

(2) Which HFC should be chosen?
The cost of HFCs can be a general constraint on uptake.
Blowing-agent costs typically represent a significant element
of overall variable costs. Accordingly, any substantial elevation
in blowing-agent costs can influence variable costs by up
to 15%. Ina highly competitive market, such increases are
unsustainable and prevent selection, unless formulation
changes can be made to reduce dependence on the more
expensive blowing agent. An example of this is the co-blowing
of HFC-based polyurethane foams with CO, generated from
the reaction of isocyanate and water.

do not use propellants and have no impact on the ozone
layer or climate. Delivery of the active drug in powder form
is technically difficult. For example, particles of respirable
size tend to have poor flow characteristics due to adhesive
interparticle forces. Additionally, most DPI formulations are
sensitive to moisture during processing, storage and in use,
thereby limiting their utility in humid climates.

COPD worldwide. In developed countries, the proportion

of current MDI to DPI use varies substantially between
countries: in the USA, 9:1 (MDI:DPI); in the UK, 7:3; in
Sweden, 2:8. This relates to a number of factors, including
availability (e.g. multidose DPIs are only recently available in
the USA compared with a local company with a long tradition
of DPI manufacture in Sweden) and affordability.

use in the 1960s and 1970s. Significant technical progress has

inhaled drugs and are now widely available in many but not all

2010. From a peak annual CFC use of over 15,000 tonnes

8000 tonnes, with HFC accounting for 3000-4000 tonnes,
in the period 2001-2004, and by 2015, HFC use is estimated
to rise to 13,000-15,000 tonnes. The lower use of HFCs

DPIs and partly because some HFC MDIs use less propellant

process for developing HFC MDIs is essentially the same

as the development of a wholly new drug product in that it
involves full clinical trials for each reformulated MDI. The
development (technical, pharmaceutical, clinical) costs for the
CFC-to-HFC transition were estimated to be approximately
US$ 1 billion in 1999 and hence now will be significantly
higher. Similar costs would be expected for de-novo DPI

were widely used worldwide in both fixed and portable
fire-extinguishing equipment beginning in the early 1960s.
Because of their high ODPs, governments and fire protection
professionals led the first sector-wide phase-out under the
Montreal Protocol. This led to the development of a range of
effective alternatives for new systems. Since fire protection is a
highly regulated sector, adopting alternatives requires extensive
changes in local, national and international standards,
practices and technology. These changes have reduced
unnecessary emissions from the halon bank and are also being
applied to the halon alternatives.

"Typically, newer multidose DPIs contain more expensive
drugs, whereas about 50% of MDIs contain salbutamol,
which is less expensive and off patent. This explains part of
the difference in individual inhaler cost. It has been estimated
that by 2015 there could be as many as 340 million HFC
MDI units containing salbutamol. Switching these to an
equivalent salbutamol DPI would incur significant costs to
health care systems. Hypothetical estimates of the cost of
switching completely from HFC MDIs to DPIs (assuming a
minimal twofold increase in price) would be on the order of
an additional and recurrent US$ 1.7-3.4 billion yr! (150-300

"There are two categories of applications that can require halon
or an alternative: fixed systems and portable extinguishers.
Halon 1301 dominated the market in fixed systems prior to
the Montreal Protocol, and its remaining bank was about

45 ktonnes in 2000. Halon 1211 was primarily used in
portable extinguishers, and the bank in 2000 was estimated
at about 154 ktonnes. Halon 2402 was used predominantly
in the former Soviet Union, and no information on banks or
emissions is available in the literature. One estimate of 2000
emissions is 2.3 ktonnes for halon 1301 and 17.8 ktonnes
for halon 1211, or about 5% and 11% of the bank per year,
respectively. One study suggests that the emission rate for
halon 1301 in fixed systems, excluding ships, aircraft and
military systems, is as little as 0.12% yr! when an exceptional
level of diligence is made in tracking and keeping the halon
in place for providing critical fire protection. An extremely
low (0.12% yr"") rate of emissions has been achieved in one
region, primarily due to unique cultural factors together with
unusually strong enforcement action, both of which may be
difficult to replicate in other regions. On average, emission

New PFC systems are no longer being produced due to the
environmental impacts of these gases upon the climate relative
to other alternatives with similar capabilities and costs. CO,
systems may be appropriate for some applications but are
lethal at concentrations necessary to extinguish fires, while
inert gas systems may also be appropriate for use in some

"For portable extinguishers, fire codes and costs are the primary
drivers in choosing an alternative (typically replacing Halon
1211). Portable extinguishers employing HFCs and PFCs
have found limited market acceptance due primarily to their
high costs compared to more traditional extinguishing agents
such as CO,, dry chemicals and water. HCFC acceptance
has been greater but is also limited by its high cost relative

to those of more traditional agents. Dry chemical agents are
between about six and sixteen times cheaper than the clean
agents and are most effective in terms of fire ratings, but they
have the disadvantage of agent residue. HFCs, PFCs and
HCFCs are the most expensive and least effective in terms of
fire-extinguishing performance (i.e. their fire ratings). Table

fire extinguishers. For each option, relative cost and climate
considerations are indicated as well as practical concerns such
as weights and dimensions. Users of Halon 1211 portable

single HFC/HCEC extinguisher at increased cost, a single
dry chemical extinguisher if the residue can be tolerated or
two extinguishers — one of water for ordinary combustibles,
and a second of CO, for use in flammable liquid fires or

near electrically energized equipment. Local and national

the bank sizes will depend upon the effectiveness of practices
to control leakage and to handle recovery at end-of-life. Banks
of HFC/PFC/HCFC/FK in fixed systems at a 2% emission
rate are projected to be 44 ktonnes in 2010 and 63 ktonnes

that approximately 68% are HCFCs, 30% are HFCs and
2% are PFCs. Looking to the future, GHG emissions from
halocarbon-based clean agent systems may either increase

Although there are no technical barriers for the transition out
of CFCs to alternatives for non-medical aerosol products,

in 2001, there was still an estimated 4300 tonnes of CFCs
used in developing countries and countries with economies
in transition (CEIT). Technical aerosols are pressurized gas
products used to clean, maintain, fix, test, manufacture or
disinfect various types of equipment or used in a number of
processes. The largest use of HFCs in technical aerosols occurs
in dusters where the substitution of HFC-134a by HFC-152a
isa leading factor in reducing GHG emissions. For cleaners
(contact cleaners, flux removers) and mould release agents,
the substitution of HCFC-141b by HFEs and HFCs with
lower GWP offers the opportunity for additional emission
reduction with no substantial technical issues. Safety aerosols
(safety signal horns, tire inflators) and insecticides for planes
and restricted areas continue to rely on HFC-134a due to

The Protocol has been effective in controlling the net growth of
these compounds in the atmosphere. As chlorine and bromine
slowly decrease in the future, ozone levels are expected to in-
crease in the coming decades, although the evolution will also
depend on the changing climate system.

"There are many complex two-way interactions between strato-

ture and transport affect the concentration and distribution of
stratospheric ozone; changes in tropospheric climate affect
stratospheric circulation; changes in stratospheric ozone influ-
ence the radiative forcing of the atmosphere, and hence surface
climate, as well as the chemistry of the troposphere. While our
understanding is still far from complete, new evidence about
some of these interactions has emerged in recent years.
"	Text
"some of these interactions has emerged in recent years.

Stratospheric ozone depletion has led to a cooling of the
stratosphere. A significant annual-mean cooling of the
lower stratosphere over the past two decades (of approxi-
mately 0.6 K per decade) has been found over the mid-lati-
tudes of both hemispheres. Modelling studies indicate that
changes in stratospheric ozone, well-mixed greenhouse
gases and stratospheric water vapour could all have contri-
buted to these observed temperature changes. In the upper
stratosphere the annual mean temperature trends are larger,
with an approximately uniform cooling over 1979-1998
of roughly 2 K per decade at an altitude of around 50 km.
Model studies indicate that stratospheric ozone changes and
carbon dioxide changes are each responsible for about 50%
of the upper stratospheric temperature trend.

The southern polar vortex, which creates the dynamical set-
ting for the Antarctic ozone hole, tends to persist longer now
than in the decades before the appearance of the ozone hole.
During the period 1990-2000, the vortex break-up in the
late spring to early summer has been delayed by two to three
weeks relative to the 1970-1980 period.

Future temperature changes in the stratosphere could ei-
ther enhance or reduce stratospheric ozone depletion, de-
pending on the region. Increases in the concentrations of
well-mixed greenhouse gases, which are expected to cool
the stratosphere, could reduce the rate of gas-phase ozone
destruction in much of the stratosphere and hence reduce
stratospheric ozone depletion. However ozone depletion in
the polar lower stratosphere depends on the low tempera-
tures there. Until stratospheric ODS abundances return to
pre-ozone-hole levels, temperature reductions in polar lat-
itudes could enhance polar ozone depletion; this effect is
expected to be most important in the Arctic late winter to
spring where a small decrease in temperature could have a
large effect on ozone.

Ozone abundance in Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes
and the Arctic is particularly sensitive to dynamical effects
"	List
"Emissions of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochloro-
fluorocarbons (HCFCs) have depleted stratospheric ozone.
Globally, ozone has decreased by roughly 3% since 1980.
The largest decreases since 1980 have been observed over
the Antarctic in spring (the ‘ozone hole’), where the month-
ly column-ozone amounts in September and October have
been about 40-50% below pre-ozone-hole values. Arctic
ozone shows high year-to-year variability during winter-
spring due to variability in dynamical transport and chemi-
cal loss (which act in concert). Chemical losses of up to
30% are observed during cold winters, whereas they are
small for dynamically active warm years.

Due to the control of ODSs under the Montreal Protocol and
its Amendments and Adjustments, the abundance of anthro-
pogenic chlorine in the troposphere has peaked and is now
declining. The tropospheric abundance of anthropogenic
bromine began decreasing in the late 1990s. Stratospheric
concentrations of ODSs lag those in the troposphere by
several years. Stratospheric chlorine levels have approxi-
mately stabilized and may have already started to decline.

Changing ODS concentrations will be a dominant fac-
tor controlling changes in stratospheric ozone for the next
few decades. Stratospheric ozone depletion is likely to be
near its maximum, but ozone abundance is subject to con-
siderable interannual variability. Assuming full compliance
with measures adopted under the Montreal Protocol, ozone
should slowly recover. Currently, there is no unequivocal
evidence from measurements in the atmosphere that the on-
set of ozone recovery has begun.

Models suggest that in Antarctica the peak in springtime
ozone depletion may already have occurred or should oc-
cur within the next few years. Because of greater variability,
predicting the timing of the peak in springtime Arctic ozone
depletion is more uncertain but models suggest it should oc-
cur within the first two decades of the 21st century. Based
on these model calculations, we do not expect an Arctic
‘ozone hole’ similar to that observed over the Antarctic.

The ozone layer will not necessarily return to its pre-deplet-
ed state, even when the abundance of stratospheric chlorine

"Halocarbons are particularly strong greenhouse gases (gases
that absorb and emit thermal infrared radiation); a halocarbon
molecule can be many thousands of times more efficient at ab-
sorbing radiant energy emitted from the Earth than a molecule
of carbon dioxide. Ozone is a greenhouse gas that also strongly
absorbs ultraviolet and visible radiation. Changes in these gases
have affected the Earth’s radiative balance in the past and will
continue to affect it in the future.
"	Text
"° Over the period 1750-2000 halocarbon gases have contri-
buted a positive direct radiative forcing of about 0.33 W nr,
which represents about 13% of the total well-mixed green-
house gas radiative forcing over this period. Over the peri-
od 1970-2000 halocarbon gases represent about 23% of the
total well-mixed greenhouse gas radiative forcing. Over the
same period, only about 5% of the total halocarbon radia-
tive forcing is from the ODS substitutes; ODSs themselves
account for 95%.

¢ Stratospheric ozone depletion has led to a negative radia-
tive forcing of about 0.15 W m? with a range of 0.1 Wm?
from different model estimates. Therefore the positive radia-
tive forcing due to the combined effect of all ODSs (0.32 W
m”) over the period 1750-2000 is larger than the negative
forcing due to stratospheric ozone depletion.

from greenhouse-gas increases could either enhance or re-
duce ozone abundance in these regions; currently, not even
the sign of the feedback is known. Furthermore, dynamical
variability can affect ozone in these regions on decadal time
scales.

Statistical and modelling studies suggest that changes in
stratospheric circulation regimes (e.g., between strong and
weak polar vortices) can have an impact on surface climate
patterns. Because future changes in ozone will have an im-
pact on the circulation of the stratosphere, these changes
could also influence the troposphere. In particular there are
indications that the Antarctic ozone hole has led to a change
in surface temperature and circulation — including the cool-
ing that has been observed over the Antarctic continent, ex-
cept over the Antarctic Peninsula where a significant warm-
ing has been observed.
"	List
"Assuming that the observed changes in ozone are caused
entirely by ODSs, the ozone radiative forcing can be con-
sidered an indirect forcing from the ODSs. However, there
is evidence that some fraction of the observed global ozone
changes cannot be attributed to ODSs, in which case the
indirect forcing by ODSs would be weaker.

The relative contributions of various halocarbons to posi-
tive direct and negative indirect forcing differ from gas to
gas. Gases containing bromine (such as halons) are particu-
larly effective ozone depleters, so their relative contribution
to negative forcing is greater than that of other ozone-de-
pleting gases, such as the CFCs.

The same magnitudes of positive direct radiative forcing
from halocarbons and of negative indirect forcing from
ozone depletion are highly likely to have a different mag-
nitude of impact on global mean surface temperature. The
climate responses will also have different spatial patterns.
As a consequence, the two forcings do not simply offset one
another.

Both the direct and indirect radiative forcings of ODSs
will be reduced as a result of the Montreal Protocol.
Nevertheless, these forcings are expected to remain signifi-
cant during the next several decades. The precise change of
each of the forcings will be affected by several factors, in-
cluding (1) the way climate change may affect stratospheric
ozone chemistry and hence the ozone indirect radiative
forcing; (2) future emissions of ODSs and their substitutes
(see Chapter 2); and (3) continuing emissions from ‘ODS
banks’ (ODSs that have already been manufactured but have
not yet been released into the atmosphere).

The large-scale circulation of the stratosphere, known as
the Brewer-Dobson circulation (see Box 1.2), systematically
transports ozone poleward and downward (figure in Box 1.2).
Because ozone photochemical reactions proceed quickly in the

The scientific issues are complex and the connections be-
tween the two problems more intricate than suggested above.
For example, not only is ozone a greenhouse gas, so that any
change in ozone abundance could have an impact on climate,
but changes in climate could affect ozone in a number of differ-
ent ways. So, the ozone distribution in the future will depend,
among other things, on the emission and impact of other green-
house gases and not just on those that deplete ozone. For this
reason, ozone recovery following the reduction in atmospheric
abundances of the ODSs will not be a simple return to the pre-
ozone-hole atmosphere (WMO, 1999, Chapter 12).

Climate change and ozone depletion have both been the
subject of recent assessments (IPCC, 2001; WMO, 2003) de-
scribing the advances in understanding made in recent years. It
is now well established, for example, that observed polar and
mid-latitude ozone depletion is a consequence of the increase in
stratospheric chlorine and bromine concentrations. The chemi-
cal processes involving these compounds and leading to polar
ozone depletion are well understood. Similarly, the important
role of ozone and the ODSs in the climate system has been
documented. Stratospheric ozone depletion during recent de-
cades has represented a negative radiative forcing of the climate
system; in contrast, the increase in ODSs has been a positive
radiative forcing. These earlier reports form an important basis
for this special report, which aims to address specifically the
coupling between the chemistry and climate problems. In par-
ticular, this report will explore the scientific issues arising from
the phase-out and replacement of ODSs as they affect strato-
spheric composition and climate change. The earlier reports did
not have this particular emphasis (although the issues were ad-
dressed by a European Commission report (EC, 2003)).

"Ozone absorbs solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation (thereby warm-
ing the stratosphere) and is a greenhouse gas (thereby warming
the troposphere). It thus plays an important role in the climate
system. Furthermore, absorption of potentially damaging UV
radiation by the stratospheric ozone layer protects life at the
Earth’s surface. Stratospheric ozone amounts have been deplet-
ed in recent decades, following emission into the atmosphere
of various ozone-depleting substances (ODSs), most of which
are also greenhouse gases. The CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons)
and halons, the major anthropogenic depleters of stratospheric
ozone, are now controlled under the Montreal Protocol and its
Amendments and Adjustments. They are being replaced by a
variety of substances with lower ozone depletion potentials
(ODPs) but that are generally still greenhouse gases, often
with large global warming potentials (GWPs). The scientific
connection between the different environmental problems of
climate change and ozone depletion, and between the provi-
sions of the Montreal Protocol and the Kyoto Protocol (and the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,
UNFCCC), is the subject of this chapter.

The distribution of ozone in the atmosphere is maintained
by a balance between photochemical production and loss, and
by transport between regions of net production and net loss.
A number of different chemical regimes can be identified for
ozone. In the upper stratosphere, the ozone distribution arises
from a balance between production following photolysis of mo-
lecular oxygen and destruction via a number of catalytic cycles
involving hydrogen, nitrogen and halogen radical species (see
Box 1.1). The halogens arise mainly from anthropogenic ODSs
(the CFCs, HCFCs and halons). In the upper stratosphere, the
rates of ozone destruction depend on temperature (a reduction in
temperature slows the destruction of ozone, see Section 1.3.2)
and on the concentrations of the radical species. In the lower
stratosphere, reactions on aerosols become important. The dis-
tribution of the radicals (and the partitioning of the nitrogen,
hydrogen and halogen species between radicals and ‘reservoirs’
that do not destroy ozone) can be affected by heterogeneous and
multiphase chemistry acting on condensed matter (liquid and
solid particles). At the low temperature of the wintertime polar
lower stratosphere, this is the chemistry that leads to the ozone
hole (see Box 1.1).

"Figure 1.1 illustrates a number of important concepts concern-
ing the ozone layer (Figure 1.1a) and its role in the stratosphere
(the region between approximately 15 and 50 km altitude in
which temperature rises with altitude, Figure 1.1b). Ozone, like
water vapour and carbon dioxide, is an important and naturally
occurring greenhouse gas; that is, it absorbs and emits radiation
in the thermal infrared (Figure 1.1c), trapping heat to warm the
Earth’s surface (Figure 1.1d). In contrast to the so-called well-
mixed greenhouse gases (WMGHGs), stratospheric ozone has
two distinguishing properties. First, its relatively short chemi-
cal lifetime means that it is not uniformly mixed throughout the
atmosphere and therefore its distribution is controlled by both
dynamical and chemical processes (Section 1.3). In fact, unlike
the WMGHGs, ozone is produced entirely within the atmos-
phere rather than being emitted into it. Second (Figure 1.1c), it
is a very strong absorber of short wavelength UV radiation (it
is also a weak absorber of visible radiation). The ozone layer’s
absorption of this UV radiation leads to the characteristic in-
crease of temperature with altitude in the stratosphere and, in
consequence, to a strong resistance to vertical motion. As well
as ozone’s role in climate it also has more direct links to hu-
mans: its absorption of UV radiation protects much of Earth’s
biota from this potentially damaging short wavelength radia-
tion. In contrast to the benefits of stratospheric ozone, high sur-
face ozone values are detrimental to human health.

stratosphere involve reactive nitrogen (X = NO), halogen (X = Cl) and hydrogen (X = H, OH) radicals. In the lower strato-
sphere, cycles catalyzed by Br also contribute to the ozone loss. Owing to the large increase of O with altitude, the rates of
these cycles increase substantially between 25 and 40 km, as does the rate of ozone production.

"The net result of both Cycle 2 and Cycle 3 is to destroy two ozone molecules and to produce three oxygen molecules. Both
cycles are catalytic, as chlorine (Cl) and bromine (Br) are not lost in the cycles. Sunlight is required to complete the cycles
and to help maintain the large ClO abundance. Cycles 2 and 3 account for most of the ozone loss observed in the late win-
ter-spring season in the Arctic and Antarctic stratosphere. At high ClO abundances, the rate of ozone destruction can reach
2 to 3% per day in late winter-spring. Outside the polar regions the ClO-BrO cycle is of minor importance because of much
lower ClO concentrations, and the effect of the ClO dimer cycle is negligible as the cycle is only effective at the low polar
temperatures.

"The stratospheric Brewer-Dobson circulation consists of rising motion in the tropics and sinking motion in the extratrop-
ics, together with an associated poleward mass flux. Its effect on chemical species is complemented by mixing (mainly
quasi-horizontal) that acts to transport air parcels both poleward and equatorward. Both processes are primarily driven by
mechanical forcing (wave drag) arising from the dissipation of planetary-scale waves in the stratosphere. These planetary
waves are generated in the troposphere by topographic and thermal forcing, and by synoptic meteorological activity, and
propagate vertically into the stratosphere. Because of filtering by the large-scale stratospheric winds, vertical propagation
of planetary waves into the stratosphere occurs primarily during winter, and this seasonality in wave forcing accounts for
the winter maximum in the Brewer-Dobson circulation. In the case of ozone, the Brewer-Dobson circulation (together with
the associated horizontal mixing) transports ozone poleward and downward and leads to a springtime maximum in extra-
tropical ozone abundance (see figure).

Since 1970 the growth in halocarbon concentrations and the
changes in ozone concentrations (depletion in the stratosphere
and increases in the troposphere) have been very significant
contributors to the total radiative forcing of the Earth’s atmos-
phere. Because halocarbons have likely caused most of the
stratospheric ozone loss (see Section 1.4.1), there is the possi-

ozone loss. This is discussed further in Section 1.5.

Human activities have led to changes in the atmospheric
concentrations of several greenhouse gases, including tropo-
spheric and stratospheric ozone and ODSs and their substitutes.
Changes to the concentrations of these gases alter the radiative
balance of the Earth’s atmosphere by changing the balance be-
tween incoming solar radiation and outgoing infrared radiation.
Such an alteration in the Earth’s radiative balance is called a
radiative forcing. This report, past IPCC reports and climate
change protocols have universally adopted the concept of ra-
diative forcing as a tool to gauge and contrast surface climate
change caused by different mechanisms (see Box 1.3). Positive
radiative forcings are expected to warm the Earth’s surface and
negative radiative forcings are expected to cool it. The radiative
forcings from the principal greenhouse gases are summarized
in Figure 1.3 and Table 1.1 (in Section 1.5.2). Other significant
contributors to radiative forcing that are not shown in Figure 1.3
include tropospheric aerosol changes and changes in the Sun’s
output. Changes in carbon dioxide (CO,) provide the largest
radiative forcing term and are expected to be the largest overall
contributor to climate change. In contrast with the positive ra-
diative forcings due to increases in other greenhouse gases, the
radiative forcing due to stratospheric ozone depletion is nega-
tive.

from the Sun reaching the tropopause (because there is less ozone to absorb it), and to slightly reduce the downward longwave radiation

However, in response to less absorption of both shortwave and longwave radiation in the stratosphere, the region cools, which leads to an
overall reduction of thermal radiation emitted downward from the stratosphere (right-hand side of schematic). The size of this adjustment
term depends on the vertical profile of ozone change and is largest for changes near the tropopause. For the observed stratospheric ozone
changes the adjustment term is larger than the positive instantaneous term, thus the stratospheric ozone radiative forcing is negative.

"The reason surface temperature changes in different models are not usually compared directly is that the climate sensitivity
is poorly known and varies by a factor of three between different climate models (IPCC, 2001, Chapter 9). Further, climate
model studies have shown that, for many forcing mechanisms, A in an individual climate model is more or less independent
of the mechanism. These two factors enable the climate change potential of different mechanisms to be quantitatively con-
trasted through their radiative forcings, while they remain difficult to compare through their predicted surface temperature
changes. Unfortunately, certain radiative forcings, including ozone changes, have been shown to have different climate
sensitivities compared with carbon dioxide changes (IPCC, 2001, Chapter 6; WMO, 2003, Chapter 4). One of the reasons
for this difference is that some aspects of the radiative forcing definition, such as tropopause height, have a large impact on
the ozone radiative forcing (see below). These factors are the main reasons for the large uncertainty in the ozone radiative
forcing and the global mean climate response.

Compared with the Antarctic, Arctic ozone abundance in
the winter and spring is highly variable (Figure 1.6), because
of interannual variability in chemical loss and in dynamical
transport. Dynamical variability within the winter stratosphere
leads to changes in ozone transport to high latitudes, and these
transport changes are correlated with polar temperature vari-
ability — with less ozone transport being associated with lower
temperatures. Low temperatures favour halogen-induced chem-

The net effect of changes in the abundance of both chlo-
rine and bromine on the total ozone-depleting halogens in the
stratosphere is estimated roughly by calculating the equivalent
effective stratospheric chlorine (EESC; Daniel et al., 1995)
(Figure 1.7d). The calculation of EESC (see Box 1.8 in Section
1.5.3) includes consideration of the total amount of chlorine
and bromine accounted for by long-lived halocarbons, how
rapidly these halocarbons degrade and release their halogen in
the stratosphere and a nominal lag time of three years to al-
low for transport from the troposphere into the stratosphere.
The tropospheric observational data suggest that EESC peaked
in the mid-1990s and has been decreasing at a mean rate of
22 ppt yr (0.7% yr) over the past eight years (Chapter | of
WMO, 2003). Direct stratospheric measurements show that
stratospheric chlorine reached a broad plateau after 1996, char-
acterized by variability (Rinsland et al., 2003).

of CFC-11 with those of HCFC-22 and HFC-134a. The behav-

general, and the behaviour of HCFC-22 and HFC-134a is rep-

curred in the 1970s and 1980s. The largest emissions were in
the NH, and concentrations in the SH lagged behind those in
the NH, consistent with an inter-hemispheric mixing time scale
of about | to 2 years. In recent years, following the implemen-
tation of the Montreal Protocol, the observed growth rate has
declined, concentrations appear to be at their peak and, as emis-
sions have declined, the inter-hemispheric gradient has almost
disappeared. In contrast, HCFC-22 and HFC-134a concentra-
tions are still growing rapidly and there is a marked inter-hemi-

It is a challenge to explain the magnitude of the water va-
pour increases seen in the Boulder frost-point data. Somewhat
less than half the observed increase of about 10% per decade

spheric methane (transported to the stratosphere and oxidized to
form water vapour). The remaining increase could be reconciled
with a warming of the tropical tropopause of approximately 1 K
per decade, assuming that air entered the stratosphere with wa-

gest that the tropical tropopause has cooled slightly for this time
period, by approximately 0.5 K per decade, and risen slightly
in altitude by about 20 m per decade (e.g., Seidel et al., 2001;

a linear trend can be fitted to these data, there is a high degree
of variability in the infrequent sampling, and the increases are
neither continuous nor steady (Figure 1.9). Long-term increases
in stratospheric water vapour are also inferred from a number

During the past three decades, aerosol loading in the strato-
sphere has primarily reflected the effects of a few volcanic
eruptions that inject aerosol and its gaseous precursors (primar-
ily sulphur dioxide, SO,) into the stratosphere. The most note-
worthy of these eruptions are El Chichén (1982) and Pinatubo
(1991). The 1991 Pinatubo eruption likely had the largest im-
pact of any event in the 20th century (McCormick ef al., 1995),
producing about 30 Tg of aerosol (compared with approximate-
ly 12 Tg from El Chich6n) that persisted into at least the late
1990s. Current aerosol loading, which is at the lowest observed
levels, is less than 0.5 Tg, so the Pinatubo event represents near-
ly a factor of 100 enhancement relative to non-volcanic levels.
The source of the non-volcanic stratospheric aerosol is primar-
ily carbonyl sulfide (OCS), and there is general agreement be-
tween the aerosols estimated by modelling the transformation
of observed OCS to sulphate aerosols and observed aerosols.
However, there is a significant dearth of SO, measurements,
and the role of tropospheric SO, in the stratospheric aerosol
budget — while significant — remains a matter of some uncer-
tainty. Because of the high variability of stratospheric aerosol
loading it is difficult to detect trends in the non-volcanic aerosol
component. Trends derived from the late 1970s to the current
period are likely to encompass a value of zero.

Measurements of tropospheric N,O show a consistent in-
crease of about 3% per decade (IPCC, 2001, Chapter 4). Because
tropospheric air is transported into the stratosphere, these posi-
tive N,O trends produce increases in stratospheric reactive ni-
trogen (NO,), which plays a key role in ozone photochemistry.
Measurements of stratospheric column NO, (a main component

mid-latitudes (about 45°) show long-term increases of approxi-

The atmospheric abundance of methane has increased by
a factor of about 2.5 since the pre-industrial era (IPCC, 2001,
Chapter 4). Measurements of methane from a global monitoring
network showed increasing values through the 1990s, but ap-
proximately constant values during 1999-2002 (Dlugokencky
et al., 2003). Changes in stratospheric methane have been
monitored on a global scale using HALOE satellite measure-
ments since 1991. The HALOE data show increases in lower
stratospheric methane during 1992-1997 that are in reasonable
agreement with tropospheric increases during this time (Randel
et al., 1999). In the upper stratosphere the HALOE data show
an overall decrease in methane since 1991, which is likely at-
tributable to a combination of chemical and dynamical influ-
ences (Nedoluha et a/., 1998; Considine et al., 2001; R6ckmann

stratosphere, where it is fairly uniform in time at a rate of about
2 K per decade (for 1979-1997). In the lower stratosphere (be-

more of a step-like change following the volcanic warming

lower stratosphere extratropics (from 20° to 60° latitude) show

most of the stratosphere since 1980. Recent updates to the
observed changes in stratospheric temperature and to the un-
derstanding of those changes have been presented in Chapters
3 and 4 of WMO (2003). Current long-term monitoring of
stratospheric temperature relies on satellite instruments and
radiosonde analyses. The Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU)
and Stratospheric Sounding Unit (SSU) instruments record
temperatures in several 10-15 km thick layers between 17 and
50 km in altitude. Radiosonde trend analyses are available up
to altitudes of roughly 25 km. Determining accurate trends with
these data sets is difficult. In particular the radiosonde coverage
is not global and suffers from data quality concerns, whereas
the satellite trend data is a result of merging data sets from se-
veral different instruments. Figure 1.4b shows global tempera-
ture time-series in the lower and middle stratosphere derived
from satellites and radiosondes. It reveals a strong imprint of

"Miucn recent progress Nas been Made In Modelling these tem-
perature trends (see Shine et al., 2003; WMO, 2003, Chapters
3 and 4). Models range from one-dimensional (1-D) fixed dy-
namical heating rate (FDH) calculations to three-dimensional
(3-D) coupled chemistry-climate models; many of their find-
ings are presented later in this chapter. FDH is a simple way of
determining the radiative response to an imposed change whilst
‘fixing’ the background dynamical heating to its climatological
value; this makes the calculation of temperature change sim-
pler, as only a radiation model needs to be used. Changes in
dynamical circulations simulated by models can lead to effects
over latitudinal bands, which vary between models. However,
dynamics cannot easily produce a global mean temperature
change. Because of this, global mean temperature is radiative-
ly controlled and provides an important focus for attribution
(Figure 1.10). For the global mean in the upper stratosphere the
models suggest roughly equal contributions to the cooling from
ozone decreases and carbon dioxide increases. In the global
mean mid-stratosphere there appears to be some discrepancy
between the SSU and modelled trends near 30 km: models pre-
dict a definite radiative cooling from carbon dioxide at these
altitudes, which is not evident in the SSU record. In the lower
stratosphere the cooling from carbon dioxide is much smaller
than higher in the stratosphere. Although ozone depletion prob-
ably accounts for up to half of the observed cooling trend, it
appears that a significant cooling from another mechanism may
be needed to account for the rest of the observed cooling. One
possible cause of this extra cooling could be stratospheric water
vapour increases. However, stratospheric water vapour changes
are currently too uncertain (see Section 1.2.3) to pinpoint their
precise role. Tropospheric ozone increases have probably con-
tributed slightly to lower stratospheric cooling by reducing up-
welling thermal radiation; one estimate suggests a cooling of
0.05 K per decade at 50 hPa and a total cooling of up to 0.5 K
over the last century (Sexton et al., 2003). The springtime cool-
ing in the Antarctic lower stratosphere is almost certainly nearly
all caused by stratospheric ozone depletion. However, the simi-
lar magnitude of cooling in the Arctic spring does not seem to
be solely caused by ozone changes, which are much smaller

One mechanism for altering temperatures in the upper
troposphere and lower stratosphere comes from the direct radia-
tive effects of halocarbons (WMO, 1986; Ramaswamy et al.,
1996; Hansen et al., 1997). In contrast with the role of carbon
dioxide, halocarbons can actually warm the upper tropospheric

Changes i in stratospheric ozone can also affect climate. The
impact of ozone changes on stratospheric temperatures has
already been discussed in Section 1.2.4. As well as the direct
impact of ozone as an absorber of UV radiation and as a green-
house gas, there are other effects that could be important. For

In summary, stratospheric temperature ‘changes over the
past few decades are significant (they are, in fact, substantially
larger than those seen in the surface temperature record over
the same period), and there are clear quantifiable features of
the contributions from ozone, carbon dioxide and volcanism in
the past stratospheric temperature record. More definite attribu-
tion of the causes of these trends is limited by the short time-
series. Future increases of carbon dioxide can be expected to
substantially cool the upper stratosphere. However, this cooling
could be partially offset by any future ozone increase (Section
1.4.2). In the lower stratosphere, both ozone recovery and halo-
carbon increases would warm this region compared with the
present. Any changes in stratospheric water vapour or changes
in tropospheric conditions, such as high-cloud properties and
tropospheric ozone, would also affect future temperatures in

"Halocarbons and carbon dioxide are greenhouse gases: they trap longwave radiation to warm the Earth’s surface. However,
compared with carbon dioxide halocarbons have quite different spectral absorption characteristics and they interact very
differently with the Earth’s radiation field. The very strong 15 um band dominates the role of carbon dioxide, whereas the
halocarbons tend to absorb weakly in the 8-13 pm atmospheric window, a region of the spectrum where other gases have
only a small effect on outgoing longwave radiation. These absorption properties, combined with a typical vertical tempera-
ture profile, means that halocarbons usually warm the atmosphere locally, whereas carbon dioxide generally cools it (the at-
mosphere only warms as a response to the induced surface warming). Further, this effect is largest at the tropical tropopause
(about 17 km altitude), where temperatures are most different from those of the underlying surface (e.g., Dickinson, 1978;
Wang et al., 1991). The tropical tropopause can be defined as the height at which the coldest temperatures are found in a
vertical temperature profile (see Figure 1.1b). The effects of halocarbon, carbon dioxide and ozone changes are contrasted

However, polar ozone loss would not occur without a prom-
inent dynamical feature of the stratosphere in winter and spring:
the polar vortex. In both hemispheres, the polar vortex sepa-
rates polar air from mid-latitude air to a large extent, and within
the vortex the low-temperature conditions that develop are the
key factor for polar ozone loss. These two factors are dynami-
cally related: a strong vortex is generally also a colder vortex.
The two crucial questions for future polar ozone are whether,
in an increased greenhouse-gas climate, the region of low strat-
ospheric temperatures will increase in area and whether it will
persist for longer in any given year (see Section 1.3.2).

the naturally occurring source gases methyl chloride (CH,Cl)

In the upper stratosphere the ozone budget is largely under-
stood, although uncertainties remain regarding the rate con-
stants of key radical reactions. In particular, strong evidence
has been accumulated that the observed ozone depletion in the
upper stratosphere is caused by increased levels of stratospher-
ic chlorine (WMO, 1999, Chapter 6; WMO, 2003, Chapter
4), as originally proposed by Molina and Rowland (1974) and
Crutzen (1974). Because of the direct correspondence between
the stratospheric chlorine abundance and ozone depletion in the
upper stratosphere, it has been suggested (e.g., WMO, 1999,
Chapter 12) that the response of stratospheric ozone to the de-
clining stratospheric chlorine levels might be first detectable in
the upper stratosphere (see also Box 1.7 in Section 1.4.2).

Int recent decades stratospheric ozone losses have been most
pronounced in polar regions during winter and spring (WMO
2003, Chapter 3; see also Figures 1.5 and 1.6). These losses
are determined largely by three chemical factors: (1) the con-
version of chlorine reservoirs into active, ozone-destroying
forms through heterogeneous reactions on the surfaces of polar
stratospheric cloud particles; (2) the availability of sunlight that
drives the catalytic photochemical cycles that destroy ozone;
and (3) the timing of the deactivation of chlorine (i.e., the tim-
ing of the conversion of active chlorine back to the reservoir
species). Temperature controls the formation and destruction of
polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) and thus the timing of activa-
tion (1) and deactivation (3) of chlorine. Furthermore, tempera-
ture controls the efficiency of the catalytic cycles (especially
the ClO dimer cycle; see Box 1.1) that destroy ozone in the
presence of sunlight (2).

The chemical processes that may affect trends of mid-lati-
tude ozone are essentially related to the ODS trends that are
known to be responsible for the observed ozone loss in the
upper stratosphere and in the polar regions. (Transport effects
are discussed in Section 1.3.4.) Halogen chemistry may lead to
ozone depletion in the mid-latitude lower stratosphere through
a number of possible mechanisms, including:

Itis well established that ozone in the lower stratosphere at mid-
latitudes has been decreasing for a few decades; both measure-
ments of ozone locally in the lower stratosphere and measure-
ments of column ozone (a quantity that is dominated by the
amount of ozone in the lower stratosphere) show a clear decline
(WMO, 2003, Chapter 4). However, because mid-latitude ozone
loss is much less severe than polar ozone loss, it cannot be iden-
tified in measurements in any one year but is rather detected as
a downward trend in statistical analyses of longer time-series. It
is clear that chemical loss driven by halogens is very important,
but other possible effects that may contribute to the observed
mid-latitude trends have also been identified. A definitive quan-
titative attribution of the trends to particular mechanisms has
not yet been achieved. Chapter 4 of WMO (2003) reviewed this
issue most recently; we will not repeat that detailed analysis

Polar ozone loss occurs when temperatures in a large enough
region sink below the threshold temperature for the existence of
PSCs (approximately 195 K), because chlorine is activated by
heterogeneous reactions on the surfaces of PSCs. Therefore, a
cooling of the stratosphere enhances Arctic ozone loss if the
volume of polar air with temperatures below the PSC threshold
value increases. (The Antarctic in winter and spring is already
consistently below this threshold.) Moreover, a stronger PSC
activity is expected to lead to a greater denitrification of the
Arctic vortex, hence a slower deactivation of chlorine and, con-
sequently, a greater chemical ozone loss (Waibel et al., 1999;
Tabazadeh et al., 2000). Rex et al. (2004) have deduced an em-
pirical relation between observed temperatures and observed
winter-spring chemical loss of Arctic ozone (Figure 1.13).
Based on this relation, and for current levels of chlorine, about
15 DU additional loss of total ozone is expected for each 1 K
cooling of the Arctic lower stratosphere.

Changes in upper stratospheric CH, (Section 1.2.3) have
important implications for upper stratospheric ozone. Siskind
et al. (1998) found that for the period 1992-1995, the increase
in active chlorine (Cl and ClO) resulting from the CH, decrease
was the largest contributor to the ozone changes occurring over
that time. Indeed, a measured increase in upper-stratospheric
ClO between 1991 and 1997, which is significantly greater than
that expected from the increase in the chlorine source gases
alone, may be explained by the observed concurrent decrease
of CH, (Froidevaux er al., 2000). Further, Li et al. (2002) find
that inter-hemispheric differences in CH, are partly responsible
(together with inter-hemispheric differences in temperature)
for observed differences in upper stratospheric ozone trends
between the two hemispheres (from the SAGE I and SAGE II
satellite experiments for 1979-1997).

of ozone would still be reduced by about 50%. Shindell (2001)
conducted a general circulation model (GCM) study for the pe-
riod 1979-1996. The simulations show a significant chemical
effect of water vapour increases on ozone concentrations, with
a reduction of more than 1% between 45 and 55 km, and a max-
imum impact of about 4% at 50 km. Further, Li et al. (2002)
found that the annually averaged (downward) ozone trend at
45°S and 1.8 hPa (45 km) increases by 1% per decade for a
water vapour increase of 1% yr!. These model results point to
an anticorrelation between ozone and water vapour in the upper
stratosphere and lower mesosphere. However, such an anticor-
relation is not seen in observations and ozone in this region var-
ies much less than predicted by models (Siskind er al., 2002).

Because wave-induced forcing in the stratosphere is be-

In the polar lower stratosphere, the rates of the heterogene-
ous reactions that are responsible for the activation of chlorine
(which eventually leads to chemical ozone destruction) increase
with increasing water vapour concentrations. An increase in
stratospheric water vapour essentially means that the temper-
ature threshold at which PSCs form, and thus heterogeneous
reactions rates begin to become significant for chlorine activa-
tion, is shifted to higher values. If stratospheric water vapour
were to increase it could lead to a substantially enhanced Arctic
ozone loss in the future (e.g., Kirk-Davidoff et al., 1999).

"Transport is a key factor influencing the seasonal and inter-
annual variability of stratospheric ozone. Seasonal variations in
transport force the large winter-spring build-up of extra-tropi-
cal total ozone in both hemispheres, and inter-hemispheric dif-
ferences in transport (larger in the NH) cause corresponding
differences in extra-tropical total ozone (see Box 1.2). In both
hemispheres, mid-latitude ozone decreases during summer and
returns to approximate photochemical balance by autumn, and
there is a strong persistence of the dynamically forced anoma-
lies throughout summer (Fioletov and Shepherd, 2003; Weber
et al., 2003). The interannual variability in the winter-spring
build-up is greater in the NH, reflecting the greater dynamical
variability of the NH stratosphere.

"Planetary waves, in addition to affecting the temperature
and chemistry of the polar stratosphere through the processes
described earlier, can also displace the centre of the polar vor-
tex off the pole. This has important implications for ozone and
NO, chemistry because air parcel trajectories within the vortex
are then no longer confined to the polar night but experience
short periods of sunlight (Solomon ef al., 1993). Polar ozone
loss processes are usually limited by the poleward retreat of the
terminator (the boundary that delineates polar night). Planetary
wave distortion of the vortex can expose deeper vortex air to
sunlight (Lee et al., 2000) and cause ozone depletion chemistry
to start earlier than it would have otherwise. In this way, wave-
induced displacements of the vortex can drive a mid-winter
start to Antarctic ozone depletion (Roscoe et al., 1997; Bodeker

"Large-scale transport of ozone is a result of advection by the
Brewer-Dobson circulation and of eddy transport effects; both
of these mechanisms are first-order terms in the zonal mean
ozone transport equation (Andrews ef al., 1987). The strength
of the Brewer-Dobson circulation is directly tied to dissipat-
ing planetary waves forced from the troposphere, and eddy
transports of ozone are also linked to planetary wave activity
(although this latter linkage is difficult to quantify), so that net
ozone transport is tied to the variability of forced planetary
waves. The amount of dissipating wave activity (also called
planetary wave drag, PWD) within the stratosphere is related
to the vertical component of wave activity entering the lower
stratosphere (the so-called Eliassen-Palm (EP) flux). This quan-

and is a convenient proxy used to quantify PWD. A significant
correlation has been found between interannual changes in
PWD and total ozone build-up during winter and spring (Fusco

In the NH, there have been interannual variations in vari-
ous meteorological parameters during the period 1980-2000
that together paint a fairly consistent, albeit incomplete, pic-
ture. During the mid-1990s the NH exhibited a number of years
when the Arctic wintertime vortex was colder and stronger
(Graf et al., 1995; Pawson and Naujokat, 1999) and more per-
sistent (Waugh et al., 1999). Any dynamically induced com-
ponent of these changes requires a weakened Brewer-Dobson
circulation, which in turn requires a decrease in PWD. Such
a decrease in PWD during this period has been documented
(Newman and Nash, 2000), although the results were sensitive
to which months and time periods were considered. Randel et
al. (2002) show that for the period 1979-2000, PWD in the NH
increased during early winter (November to December) and de-
creased during mid-winter (January to February). This seasonal
variation is consistent with the Arctic early winter warming
and late winter cooling seen over the same time period at 100
hPa (Langematz et al., 2003; see also Figure 1.16 in Section
1.4.1.2). The weakened Brewer-Dobson circulation during mid-
winter implies a decrease in the winter build-up of mid-latitude
ozone, and Randel er al. (2002) estimated that the decreased
wave driving may account for about 20-30% of the observed
changes in ozone in the January to March period. Changes in
SH dynamics are not as clear as in the NH, primarily because
meteorological reanalysis data sets are less well constrained by
observations.

Consistent regional increases are also seen in meteorological

The past and future variability of STE remains to be assessed.
It is clear that changes in planetary wave activity will modify
the Brewer-Dobson circulation and hence affect global trans-
port processes (Rind et al., 1990; Butchart and Scaife, 2001). As
for regional mechanisms, seasonal and interannual variability,
driven, for example, by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)
and the El Nifio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), have already
been observed (James ef al., 2003; Sprenger and Wernli, 2003).
Changes in the occurrence of regional and local weather phe-
nomena could also modify STE. Fifteen-year studies with re-
analysis products have not yielded any distinct trends (Sprenger
and Wernli, 2003). Given the discrepancies between different
approaches to evaluate STE and inhomogeneities in meteoro-
logical analyses and reanalyses, consistent trend studies are not
available as of yet.

"However, the effects of tropospheric circulation changes
on ozone and the relation of both to tropopause height changes
remain poorly understood at present. In particular, the relation-
ship between tropopause height and ozone mentioned earlier
applies to single stations; there is no reason to expect it to apply
in the zonal mean, or on longer time scales (e.g., seasonal or
interannual) over which ozone transport is irreversible. Because
of our poor understanding of what controls the zonal-mean mid-
latitude tropopause height, or whether it is possible to consider
such processes in a zonal-mean approach, it is not clear that
the ozone-tropopause height correlations (derived from daily
or monthly statistics) can be extended to decadal time scales in
order to estimate changes in ozone. Some recent model stud-
ies suggest that lower stratospheric cooling caused by ozone
depletion, acting together with tropospheric warming due to
WMGHGs, can be a contributor to tropopause height changes

Dobson, 1963; Bojkov et al., 1993). Day-to-day changes in tro-
popause height are associated with the passage of synoptic-scale
disturbances in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere,
which affect ozone in the lower stratosphere through trans-
port (Salby and Callaghan, 1993) and can result in large local
changes in column ozone, particularly in the vicinity of storm
tracks (James, 1998). In extreme situations, they can lead to so-
called ozone mini-holes, which occur over both hemispheres
and have the lowest column ozone levels observed outside the
polar vortices, sometimes well under 220 DU (Allaart er al.,
2000; Hood et al., 2001; Teitelbaum ef al., 2001; Canziani et
al., 2002). Ozone mini-holes do not primarily entail a destruc-
tion of ozone, but rather its re-distribution. Changes in the spa-
tial and temporal occurrence of synoptic-scale processes and
Rossby wave breaking (e.g., storm track displacements) that are
induced by climate change or natural variability, could lead to
changes in the distribution or frequency of the occurrence of
mini-hole and low-ozone events, and thus to regional changes
in the mean column ozone (Hood et al., 1999; Reid et al., 2000;
Orsolini and Limpasuvan, 2001).

"Stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) processes also affect
the ozone distribution and have the capability to affect tropo-
spheric chemistry. STE is a two-way process that encompasses
transport from the troposphere into the stratosphere (TST) and
from the stratosphere into the troposphere (STT) through a vari-
ety of processes (see Holton et al., 1995, and references therein).
Some aspects of STE are implicit in the preceding discussions.
The net mass flux from the troposphere into the stratosphere and
back again is driven by PWD through the Brewer-Dobson circu-
lation (Section 1.1.2; Holton et al., 1995). Although the global
approach can explain the net global flux, local and regional pro-
cesses need to be identified and assessed to fully understand the
distribution of trace species being exchanged. Such understand-
ing is relevant both for chemical budgets and for climate change
and variability studies. Although there is a net TST in the trop-
ics and a net STT in the extratropics, a number of mechanisms
that lead to STT in the tropics and TST in the extratropics have
been identified (e.g., Appenzeller and Davies, 1992; Poulida et
al., 1996; Hintsa et al., 1998; Ray et al., 1999; Lelieveld and
Dentener, 2000; Stohl et a/., 2003). In the extratropics TST can
significantly affect the composition of the lowermost stratosphere,
even if the exchange cannot reach higher into the stratosphere,
by introducing, during deep TST events, near-surface pollutants,
and ozone-poor and humid air. Similarly, deep STT events can
transport ozone-rich air into the mid- and lower troposphere. It
should be noted, however, that so-called shallow events, with ex-
changes near the tropopause, remain the main feature in the ex-
tratropics. Regions of occurrence of such exchange processes, at
least in the NH (Sprenger and Wernli, 2003), appear to be linked
to the storm tracks and their variability, that is, in the same region
where mini-holes are most frequent.

Air entering the stratosphere is dehydrated as it passes
through the cold tropical tropopause, and this drying accounts
for the extreme aridity of the global stratosphere (Brewer,
1949). Furthermore, the seasonal cycle in tropopause tempera-
ture imparts a strong seasonal variation in stratospheric water
vapour, which then propagates with the mean stratospheric
transport circulation (Mote er al., 1996). Year-to-year variations
in tropical tropopause temperatures are also highly correlated
with global stratospheric water vapour anomalies (Randel et
al., 2004), although there remain some issues concerning the
consistency of decadal-scale changes in water vapour (Section
1.2.3). However, while there is strong empirical coupling be-
tween tropopause temperatures and stratospheric water vapour,
details of the dehydration mechanism(s) within the TTL are
still a topic of scientific debate (Holton and Gettelman, 2001;
Sherwood and Dessler, 2001). One critical, unanswered ques-
tion is whether, and how, the TTL will change in response to
climate change and what will be the resulting impact on strato-
spheric ozone.

Air enters the stratosphere primarily in the tropics, and hence
the physical and chemical characteristics of air near the tropi-
cal tropopause behave as boundary conditions for the global
stratosphere. The tropical tropopause is relatively high, near 17
km. The tropospheric lapse rate (up to 12-14 km) is determined
by radiative-convective equilibrium, whereas the thermal struc-
ture above 14 km is primarily in radiative balance, which is
characteristic of the stratosphere (Thuburn and Craig, 2002).
Overall, the region of the tropical atmosphere between about
12 km and the tropopause has characteristics intermediate to
those of the troposphere and stratosphere, and is referred to as
the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) (Highwood and Hoskins,
1998). Thin (sometimes subvisible) cirrus clouds are observed
over large areas of the TTL (Wang ef al., 1996; Winker and
Trepte, 1998), although their formation mechanism(s) and ef-
fects on large-scale circulation are poorly known. In the tropics,
the background clear-sky radiative balance shifts from cooling
in the troposphere to heating in the stratosphere, with the transi-
tion occurring at around 15 km. The region of heating above
about 15 km is linked to mean upward motion into the lower
stratosphere, and this region marks the base of the stratospheric
Brewer-Dobson circulation.

A number of modelling studies have examined the effect
of increased concentrations of greenhouse gases on the annular
modes (e.g., Perlwitz et al., 2000; Shindell er al., 2001a; Gillett

ocean climate models agree in finding a positive NAM trend
under increasing greenhouse-gas concentrations, a trend which
is qualitatively consistent with the observed positive NAM trend.
Amore positive NAM is consistent with a stronger stratospheric
vortex. On the other hand, an intensified polar vortex is related
to changes in planetary- and synoptic-scale wave characteristics,
and may produce tropospheric circulation anomalies similar to
the positive phase of the NAM. These potential feedbacks ob-
scure cause and effect. For example, whereas Rind et al. (2002)
and Sigmond et al. (2004) found that in the middle stratosphere
the perturbation to the NAM from a2 x CO, climate depends on
modelled changes in sea-surface temperatures (SSTs), Sigmond
et al. (2004) suggested that perturbations in the zonal wind near
the surface (which will affect the response to SSTs) are mainly
caused by doubling of stratospheric CO,.

the large amplitude NAM anomalies tend to propagate from the
stratosphere to the troposphere on time scales of weeks to a few
months (Baldwin and Dunkerton, 1999; Christiansen, 2001).
Furthermore, because of the strong coupling between the strat-

and NAO has been associated with processes that are known
to affect the strength of the stratospheric polar vortex, such as
tropical volcanic eruptions (Kodera, 1994; Kelly et al., 1996;

have shown that a simulated trend in the tropospheric NAM and
SAM does not necessarily depend on stratospheric involvement
(Fyfe et al., 1999; Gillett et al., 2002b). Global climate model-

"The effect of ozone loss on polar stratospheric temperatures re-
sults in concomitant changes in stratospheric zonal winds and
polar vortex structure, and also possible changes in planetary-
wave behaviour. The strongest effect is seen in the Antarctic,
where a large cooling of the lower stratosphere, which is associ-
ated with the ozone hole (Randel and Wu, 1999), has resulted
in an intensified and more persistent springtime polar vortex.
Waugh et al. (1999) show that since the ozone hole developed,
the break-up date of the Antarctic vortex occurs two to three
weeks later (moving from mid-November to early December)
than before. Recent research has shown that trends in surface
temperatures over Antarctica (cooling over the interior and part
of the warming over the peninsula) may be in part traceable, at
least over the period 1980-2000, to trends in the lower strat-
ospheric polar vortex, which are largely caused by the ozone
hole (Thompson and Solomon, 2002). It has been suggested
that during the early summer the strengthening of the west-
erly flow extends all the way to the surface (Thompson and
Solomon, 2002). The role of this mechanism — which has yet to
be elucidated — has been highlighted by the modelling study of
Gillett and Thompson (2003), who prescribed ozone depletion
in an atmospheric climate model. They found that the season-
ality, structure and amplitude of the modelled changes in 500
hPa geopotential height and near-surface air temperature in the
Antarctic had similar spatial patterns to observations, which
were a cooling over the Antarctic interior and a warming over
the peninsula and South America (Figure 1.14). This result sug-
gests that anthropogenic emissions of ozone-depleting gases
have had a distinct impact on climate not only in the strato-
sphere but also at the Earth’s surface. These surface changes
appear to act in the same direction as changes resulting from
increases in greenhouse gases (Shindell and Schmidt, 2004).

widely used in many ozone assessments, they have important
limitations in terms of, for example, their ability to include the
full range of feedbacks between chemistry and dynamics, or
their ability to reproduce the polar vortex (which will then in-

As discussed in Section 1.3.4, changes in atmospheric dy-
namics can also have a significant influence on NH mid-lati-
tude column ozone on decadal time scales. Natural variability,
changes in greenhouse gases and changes in column ozone
itself are all likely to contribute to these dynamical changes.
Furthermore, because chemical and dynamical processes are
coupled, their contributions to ozone changes cannot be con-
sidered in isolation. This coupling is especially complex and

In the upper stratosphere the observed ozone depletion over the
last 25 years is statistically robust in the sense that its value is
not sensitive to small differences in the choice of the time peri-
od analyzed (WMO, 2003, Chapter 4). This behaviour accords
with the fact that in this region of the atmosphere, ozone is un-
der photochemical control and thus only weakly affected by
dynamical variability. We therefore expect upper-stratospheric
ozone abundance to reflect long-term changes in temperature
and in the abundance of species (principally halogens) that re-
act chemically with ozone.

"In Section 1.3 a number of processes were described that can
influence the distribution of and changes in stratospheric ozone.
Here we discuss the current understanding of past ozone chang-
es, based in part on numerical models that attempt to include
these processes. A hierarchy of models of increasing sophistica-
tion is used (see Box 1.5). Some models include relatively few
processes (e.g., box models, which include only chemical pro-
cesses, but perhaps in great detail), whereas others attempt to in-
clude many more (e.g., the chemistry-climate models, CCMs).
The models have their different uses, and strengths, some of
which are described in the remainder of Section 1.4.

"However, the changes in upper-stratospheric ozone repre-
sent only a small contribution to the total changes in column
ozone observed over the last 25 years, except in the tropics
where there is no statistically significant trend in column ozone
(WMO, 2003, Chapter 4). Most of the column ozone deple-
tion in the extratropics occurs in the lower stratosphere, where
the photochemical time scale for ozone becomes long and the
ozone distribution is sensitive to dynamical variability as well
as to chemical processes. This complicates the problem of at-
tribution of the observed ozone decline. Strong ozone variabil-
ity and complex coupled interactions between dynamics and
chemistry, which are not separable in a simple manner, make
attribution particularly difficult.

"Over the past 25 years there have been large changes in the
abundance of halogen compounds, and the extent of the ob-
served ozone decrease is consistent with the observed increase
in anthropogenic chlorine, as originally predicted by Molina and
Rowland (1974) and Crutzen (1974). In particular, the vertical
and latitudinal profiles of ozone trends in the upper stratosphere
are reproduced by 2-D photochemistry models. In the upper
stratosphere the attribution of ozone loss in the last couple of
decades to anthropogenic halogens is clear-cut. The 2-D mod-
els indicate that changes in halogens make the largest contribu-
tion to the observed loss of about 7% per decade (WMO, 2003,
Chapter 4). The observed cooling of the upper stratosphere (of
perhaps 2 K per decade, see Figure 1.10) will have reduced the
rate of ozone destruction in this region. If we take the observed
variation of ozone with temperature in the upper stratosphere
(e.g., Barnett et al., 1975; Froidevaux et al., 1989), then a cool-
ing of 2 K per decade should have led to an increase in ozone
of about 2% per decade, partially compensating the loss caused
by halogens. Note, however, that in the upper stratosphere ra-
diative-transfer models suggest roughly equal contributions to
the cooling from ozone decreases and carbon dioxide increases
(Figure 1.10); the changes in the ozone-temperature system are
nonlinear. Changes in CH, and N,O will have also played a

"A number of 2-D models contributed to Chapter 4 of WMO
(2003), and a schematic showing their simulations of column
ozone between 60°S and 60°N from 1980 to 2050 is provided
in the figure in Box 1.7 (in Section 1.4.2). The symbols in this
figure show the observed changes relative to 1980. As there
are no significant trends in tropical ozone, the observed and
modelled changes are attributable to mid-latitudes. The shaded
area shows the results of 2-D photochemistry models forced
by observed changes in halocarbons, other source gases and
aerosols (and in some cases, temperatures) from 1980 to 2000.
Overall, the models broadly reproduce the long-term changes
in mid-latitude column ozone for 1980-2000, within the range
of uncertainties of the observations and the model range. The
spread in the model results comes mainly from their large
spread over the SH mid-latitudes, and is at least partly a result
of their treatment of the Antarctic ozone hole (which cannot be
well represented in a 2-D model). In addition, the agreement be-
tween models and observations over 60°S to 60°N hides some
important disagreements within each hemisphere. In particular,
models suggest that the chemical signal of ozone loss follow-
ing the major eruption of the Mt. Pinatubo volcano in the early
1990s should have been symmetric between the hemispheres,
but observations show a large degree of inter-hemispheric
asymmetry in mid-latitudes (see the more detailed discussion in
Section 4.6 of WMO, 2003).

although, for reasons of computational efficiency, simplifying assumptions (parametrizations) must still be made. For ex-
ample, the atmosphere in a global model requires discretization, which is generally done by decomposing it into boxes of
a specific size. Processes acting on smaller scales than the boxes cannot be treated individually and must be parametrized,

discrepancies between atmospheric observations and results from the models. Furthermore, numerical models allow us to
make predictions about the future development of the atmosphere. Today, a hierarchy of atmospheric models of increas-
ing complexity is employed for the investigation of the Earth’s atmosphere. Models range from simple (with perhaps one

In summary, the vertical, latitudinal and seasonal character-
istics of past changes in mid-latitude ozone are broadly consist-
ent with the understanding that halogens are the primary cause
of these changes. However, to account for decadal variations
it is necessary to include consideration of the interplay be-
tween dynamical and chemical effects as well as the impact of
variations in aerosol loading (WMO, 2003, Chapter 4); our in-
adequate quantitative understanding of these processes limits

The seasonality of the long-term changes in mid-latitude
column ozone differs between hemispheres. In the NH, the
maximum decrease is found in spring, and it decays through
to late autumn. Fioletov and Shepherd (2003) have shown that
in the NH the ozone decreases in summer and early autumn are
the photochemically damped signal of winter-spring losses, and
thus arise from the winter-spring losses (however they occur)
without any need for perturbed chemistry in the summertime.
The same seasonality is not enough for explaining the summer
and early autumn ozone decreases observed in the SH mid-la-
titudes (Fioletov and Shepherd, 2003) because they are com-
parable with the winter-spring losses and therefore point to the
influence of transport of ozone-depleted air into mid-latitudes
following the break- K-up of the ozone hole.

Given the fairly predictable nature of the Antarctic ozone
hole, its simulation constitutes a basic test for models. Two-
dimensional models are not expected to represent the ozone
hole well because they cannot properly represent isolation of
polar vortex air (WMO, 2003, Chapter 4), and their estimates
of Antarctic ozone loss vary greatly. However, an emerging
tool for attribution is the 3-D chemistry-climate model (CCM).
These models include an on-line feedback of chemical compo-
sition to the dynamical and radiative components of the model.
The CCMs currently available have been developed with an
emphasis on the troposphere and stratosphere. They consider
a wide range of chemical, dynamical and radiative feedback
processes and can be used to address the question of why
changes in stratospheric dynamics and chemistry may have oc-
curred as a result of anthropogenic forcing. The models specify
WMGHGs, source gases, aerosols and often SSTs, but other-
wise run freely and exhibit considerable interannual variability
(in contrast with the 2-D models). Thus in addition to issues of
model accuracy, it is necessary to consider how representative
are the model simulations.

"The Antarctic ozone hole represents the most striking exam-
ple of ozone depletion in the atmosphere. It developed through
the 1980s as chlorine loading increased, and has recurred every
year since then (Figure 1.5). The Antarctic ozone hole has been
clearly attributed to anthropogenic chlorine through field cam-
paigns and photochemical modelling (WMO, 1999, Chapter 7).
An ozone hole now occurs every year because, in addition to the
availability of anthropogenic chlorine, wintertime temperatures
in the Antarctic lower stratosphere are always low enough for
chlorine activation to occur on PSCs prior to the return of sun-
light to the vortex in the spring, and the air is always sufficiently
isolated within the vortex for it to become strongly depleted of
ozone (see Box 1.1). There is nevertheless dynamically induced
variability in the extent and severity of the ozone hole, as seen
in Figure 1.5. The most dramatic instance of such variability
occurred in 2002, when the Antarctic stratosphere experienced
its first observed sudden warming (see Box 1.6). The sudden
warming split the vortex in two (figure in Box 1.6) and halted
the development of the ozone hole that year. Such events occur
commonly in the NH, as a result of the stronger planetary-wave
forcing in the NH, but had never before been seen in the SH,
although there had been previous instances of disturbed winters

"In recent years a number of CCMs have been employed to
examine the effects of climate change on ozone (Austin et al.,
2003). They have been used for long-term simulations to try to
reproduce observed past changes, such as ozone and tempera-
ture trends. The models have been run either with fixed forcings
to investigate the subsequent ‘equilibrium climate’ (so-called
time-slice runs) or with time-varying forcings (so-called tran-
sient runs). The current CCMs can reproduce qualitatively the
most important atmospheric features (e.g., stratospheric winds
and temperatures, and ozone columns and profiles) with respect
to the mean conditions and the seasonal and interannual vari-
ability; the long-term changes in the dynamical and chemical
composition of the upper troposphere and the stratosphere are
also in reasonable agreement with observations. But a reason-
able reproduction of the timing of the ozone hole and an ade-
quate description of total column ozone do not necessarily mean
that all processes in the CCMs are correctly captured. There are
obvious discrepancies between the models themselves, and be-
tween model results and detailed observations. Some of the dif-
ferences among the models are caused by the fact that the spe-
cific model systems employed differ considerably, not only in
complexity (e.g., the number of chemical reactions considered
and the parametrization of sub-grid-scale processes), but also
in the vertical extent of the model domain and in the horizontal

"The unusual behaviour of the Antarctic ozone hole in 2002 highlights the important role that tropospheric climate and
dynamics play in ozone depletion processes. Year-to-year changes in ozone hole area (or depth) are more likely to reflect
changes in stratospheric dynamics that influence ozone loss over the short term, rather than long-term issues such as
changes in stratospheric concentrations of ODSs controlled by the Montreal Protocol. During the early winter of 2002,
the Antarctic ozone hole was unusually disturbed (Allen et al., 2003; Stolarski et al., 2005) as a result of a series of wave
events (Newman and Nash, 2005). The anomalously high stratospheric wave activity was forced by strong levels of plan-
etary wave | (a single wave encircling the globe) in the mid-latitude lower troposphere and a tropopause wave propagation
regime that favoured transmission of these waves to the lower stratosphere. The wave events occurred irregularly over the
course of the winter and preconditioned the polar vortex for an extremely large wave event on 22 September. This large
wave event resulted in the first ever major stratospheric sudden warming to be observed in the SH, which split the Antarctic
ozone hole in two (see figure). Such a splitting of the vortex in two is a characteristic signature of wave-2 sudden warmings
in the NH and is well understood dynamically.

Compared with other recent decades, the 1990s had an un-
usually high number of cold years, and these led to low values
of Arctic ozone (Figure 1.6). In more recent years, Arctic ozone
has been generally higher, although still apparently below pre-
1980 values. This behaviour does not reflect the time evolution
of stratospheric chlorine loading (Figure 1.7d). Rather, it re-
flects the meteorological variability in the presence of chlorine
loading. In this respect the Arctic ozone record needs to be in-
terpreted in the context of the meteorology of a given year, far

"In contrast with the Antarctic, winter-spring ozone abun-
dance in the Arctic exhibits significant year-to-year variability,
as seen in Figure 1.6. This variability arises from the highly dis-
turbed nature of Arctic stratospheric dynamics, including rela-
tively frequent sudden warmings (every 2 to 4 years). Because
dynamical variability affects both transport and temperature,
dynamical and chemical effects on ozone are coupled. The dy-
namical variability is controlled by stratospheric PWD; years
with strong PWD, compared with years with weak PWD, have
stronger downwelling over the pole, and thus higher tempera-
tures, a weaker vortex and more ozone transport (Newman ef
al., 2001). Because low temperatures and a stronger vortex tend
to favour chemical ozone loss in the presence of elevated halo-
gen levels (Section 1.3.2), it follows that dynamical and chemi-
cal effects tend to act in concert. In the warmest years (e.g.,
1999) there is essentially no chemical ozone loss and ozone
levels are similar to those seen pre-1980. The chemical ozone
loss was calculated for cold years using various methods in
Section 3.3 of WMO (2003), and the agreement between the
methods provided confidence in the estimates. The calculations
showed a roughly linear relationship between chemical ozone
loss and temperature (see also Figure 1.13, which shows the re-
lationship of ozone loss to V,..., which itself varies linearly with
temperature (Rex et al., 2004)). Furthermore, the in situ chemi-
cal ozone loss was found to account for roughly one half of the
observed ozone decrease between cold years and warm years.
Given the high confidence in the estimates of chemical ozone
loss, the remaining half can be attributed to reduced ozone
transport, as is expected in cold years with weak PWD, a strong
vortex, and weak downwelling over the pole. From this it can
be concluded that in cold years, chlorine chemistry doubled the
ozone decrease that would have occurred from transport alone
(WMO, 2003, Chapter 3).

observed cooling in November and the prolonged persistence
of the vortex have been shown to be the result of the ozone
hole (Randel and Wu, 1999; Waugh et al., 1999). These results
(for both hemispheres) are illustrated by Figure 1.16. There is
seen to be little impact from CO, at these altitudes over this

too small and too late in the season to account for the observed
cooling. Rather, as discussed above, the observed cooling is re-

Bearing these caveats in mind, the simulations of past Arctic
minimum ozone from the CCMs considered in Austin et al.
(2003) are shown in Figure 1.17. (Because of the large degree
of scatter, the results are shown separately for the transient and
time-slice simulations.) The models seem generally to have a
positive bias with respect to the observations over the same pe-
riod. None of the CCMs achieve column ozone values as low
as those observed, and the modelled ozone trends are generally
smaller than the observed trend (Austin er a/., 2003). However,
the range of variability exhibited by each of the models is con-
siderable, and it is therefore difficult to say that the models are
definitely deficient on the basis of the ozone behaviour alone;
more detailed diagnostics are required — such as comparison
with the observed relationship shown in Figure 1.13 and with
observations of other chemical species.

These considerations have implications for the attribution of
past changes. No matter how good a CCM is and how well its
climate-change experiments are characterized, it cannot exactly
reproduce the real atmosphere because the real atmosphere is
only one possible realization of a chaotic system. The best one
can expect, even for a perfect model (that is, a model that cor-
rectly considers all relevant processes), is that the observations
fall within the range of model-predicted behaviours, according
to appropriate statistical criteria. Whether this permits a mean-
ingful prediction depends on the relative magnitudes and time
scales of the forced signal and the natural noise. Whereas the
evolution of Antarctic ozone is expected to be fairly predictable
over decadal time scales (past and future), it is not at all clear
whether this is the case in the Arctic. Thus, it is not a priori ob-
vious that even a perfect CCM would reproduce the decreases
in Arctic ozone observed over the past 20 years, for example.

Because 2-D models can be expected to capture the main
chemical processes involved in ozone recovery, reliable predic-
tions of future changes in the coupled ozone-climate system
require the use of CCMs, since they consider possible changes
in climate feedback mechanisms. Despite some present limita-
tions, these models have been employed in sensitivity studies
to assess the global future development of the chemical com-
position of the stratosphere and climate. The results have been
compared with each other to assess the uncertainties of such
predictions (Austin et al., 2003), and have been documented in
international assessment reports (WMO, 2003, Chapter 3; EC,

As discussed in Section 1.3.4, two dynamical influences
appear to be related to NH mid-latitude ozone decreases over
1980-2000: a decrease in PWD and an increase in tropopause
height. These mechanisms likewise have the potential to in-
fluence future ozone. If the past dynamical changes represent
natural variability, then one cannot extrapolate past dynamical
trends, and ozone recovery could be either hastened or delayed
by dynamical variability. If, on the other hand, the past dynami-
cal changes represent the dynamical response to WMGHG-in-
duced climate change, then one might expect these changes to
increase in magnitude in the future. This would decrease future
ozone levels and delay ozone recovery. In the case of tropo-
pause height changes, to the extent that they are themselves
caused by ozone depletion, the changes should reverse in the
future.

Two of the 2-D models used in the simulations included in-
teractive temperature changes caused by increasing greenhouse
gases, which result in a long-term cooling of the stratosphere
(one model includes this feedback throughout the entire strato-
sphere, and the other only above about 30 km). Cooling in the
upper stratosphere results in slowing of the gas-phase chemical
cycles that destroy ozone there (Section 1.3.2), and consequent-
ly these two models show a greater increase with time of total
ozone (defining the upper range in the middle 21st century in
the figure in Box 1.7) than the other models. An important ca-
veat is that most of the past (1980-2000) column ozone change
has occurred in the lower stratosphere, and future temperature
feedback effects are more complicated and uncertain in the low-
er stratosphere. Furthermore, these effects involve changes in
transport, heterogeneous chemistry and polar processes, which
are not accurately simulated in 2-D models. (Note, however,
that at least one CCM (Pitari et al., 2002) also predicts a simi-
lar fast recovery.) At present there is considerable uncertainty
regarding the details of temperature feedbacks on future mid-
latitude column ozone changes.

"The halogen loading of the stratosphere increased rapidly in
the 1970s and 1980s. As a result of the Montreal Protocol and
its Amendments and Adjustments, the stratospheric loading
of chlorine and bromine is expected to decrease slowly in the
coming decades, reaching pre-1980 levels some time around
2050 (WMO, 2003, Chapter 1). If chlorine and bromine were
the only factors affecting stratosphere ozone, we would then
expect stratospheric ozone to ‘recover’ at about the same time.
Over this long (about 50-year) time scale, the state of the strato-
sphere may well change because of other anthropogenic effects,
in ways that affect ozone abundance. For example, increasing
concentrations of CO, are expected to further cool the strato-
sphere, and therefore to influence the rates of ozone destruction.
Any changes in stratospheric water vapour, CH, and N,O, all
of which are difficult to predict quantitatively, will also affect
stratospheric chemistry and radiation. In addition, natural cli-
mate variability including, volcanic eruptions, can affect ozone
on decadal time scales. For these reasons, ‘recovery’ of strat-
ospheric ozone is a complicated issue (see Box 1.7). A number
of model calculations to investigate recovery were reported
in Chapters 3 and 4 of WMO (2003), using both 2-D and 3-D

reported since then, are summarized here. As with the discus-

detection of the onset of recovery requires more than the observation of a slow down or even a reversal of a downward

ozone in a particular region of the atmosphere can be attributed to the reduction of the atmospheric concentrations of an-
thropogenic halogen compounds as a result of the Montreal Protocol. Although one recent paper (Newchurch et al., 2003)
has reported that the first stage of a recovery of the ozone layer has been detected in observations of upper-stratospheric

For the Antarctic, where the CCMs all reproduce the de-
velopment of the ozone hole in a reasonably realistic man-
ner, the predicted future evolution is shown in Figure 1.15.
Considering all the models, there is an overall consensus that
the recovery of the Antarctic ozone hole will essentially fol-
low the stratospheric chlorine loading. There is a hint in Figure
1.15 of a slight delay in the recovery compared with the peak
in chlorine loading, presumably because of a cooling arising
from the specified increase in WMGHG concentrations. Austin
et al. (2003) estimated that the recovery of the Antarctic ozone
layer can be expected to begin any year within the range 2001
to 2008. This would mean that Antarctic ozone depletion could
slightly increase within the next few years despite a decrease
in stratospheric chlorine loading, because lower temperatures
would increase chlorine activation. However there is consider-
able natural variability, so it is also quite possible that the most
severe Antarctic ozone hole has already 0 occurred.

"To summarize the results from 2-D models, upper-strato-
spheric ozone in the mid-latitudes will recover to pre-1980
levels well before stratospheric chlorine loading returns to pre-
1980 levels, and could even overshoot pre-1980 levels because
of CO,-induced upper-stratospheric cooling (see, for example,
WMO, 2003, Chapter 4). However, details of this future evolu-
tion are sensitive to many factors (uncertain emission scenarios,
future climate change, changes in water vapour, volcanic erup-
tions, etc.) and there is significant divergence between different
models. In terms of mid-latitude column ozone, where changes
are expected to be dominated by ozone in the lower stratosphere,
2-D models all predict a steadily increasing ozone abundance as
halogen levels decrease. While these models usually include a
detailed treatment of polar chemistry, they do not include a de-
tailed treatment of polar dynamics and mixing to mid-latitudes,
or of dynamical aspects of climate change. Any future changes
in stratospheric circulation and transport, or a large Pinatubo-like
volcanic eruption, could have the potential to affect global col-
umn ozone, both directly and indirectly via chemical processes.
Quantitative prediction is clearly difficult. At this stage, CCM
simulations provide sensitivity calculations, which allow for the
exploration of some examples of possible future evolution.

"In the Arctic, where ozone depletion is more sensitive to me-
teorological conditions, the picture drawn by the CCMs is not
consistent (Figure 1.17). Whereas most CCMs also predict a de-
layed start of Arctic ozone recovery (according to Austin et al.
(2003), any year within the range 2004 to 2019), others indicate
a different development: they simulate an enhanced PWD that
produces a more disturbed and warmer NH stratospheric vortex
in the future. (Enhanced PWD would also lead to a stronger me-
ridional circulation and faster removal of CFCs.) This ‘dynami-
cal heating’ more than compensates for the radiative cooling
due to enhanced greenhouse-gas concentrations. Under these
circumstances, and in combination with reduced stratospheric
chlorine concentrations, polar ozone in these CCMs recovers
within the next decade to values measured before the start of
stratospheric ozone depletion. However, none of the current
models suggest that an ‘ozone hole’, similar to that observed
in the Antarctic, will occur over the Arctic (Figure 1.17). In this
respect, the earlier GISS result (Shindell et al., 1998), which

Unfortunately, our ability to predict future dynamical influ-
ences on ozone is very poor, for two reasons. First, dynamical
processes affecting ozone exhibit significant temporal variabil-
ity and are highly sensitive to other aspects of the atmospheric
circulation. This means that the WMGHG-induced signal is in-
herently difficult to isolate or to represent accurately in CCMs,
whereas the climate noise is relatively high (especially in the
NH). Second, there are still uncertainties in the performance of
the CCMs, which are the tools needed to address this question.
As discussed in Section 1.4.1, predictions of WMGHG-induced
dynamical changes by CCMs do not even agree on the sign
of the changes: some models predict a weakened PWD, which
would decrease mid-latitude (and polar) ozone by weakening
transport, whereas others predict a strengthened PWD. Note
that these dynamical changes would also affect the lifetime of
stratospheric pollutants, with stronger PWD leading to shorter
lifetimes (Rind et al., 1990; Butchart and Scaife, 2001). (The
latter effect acts on the several-year time scale associated with
the Brewer-Dobson circulation, in contrast with the essentially
instantaneous effect of PWD on ozone transport.) Thus, the di-
rect effect of PWD change on ozone transport (no matter what
its sign) would be reinforced over decadal time scales by al-
tered chemical ozone loss arising from PWD-induced changes
in stratospheric chlorine loading.

that for many climate mechanisms A varies with the latitude

In summary, the Antarctic ozone hole is expected to recover
more or less following the decrease in chlorine loading, and
return to 1980 levels in the 2045 to 2055 time frame. There may
be a slight delay arising from WMGHG-induced cooling, but
natural variability in the extent of the ozone hole is sufficiently
large that the most severe ozone hole may have already oc-
curred, or may occur in the next five years or so. With regard to
the Arctic, the future evolution of ozone is potentially sensitive
to climate change and to natural variability, and will not neces-
sarily follow strictly the chlorine loading. There is uncertainty
in even the sign of the dynamical feedback to WMGHG chang-
es. Numerical models like CCMs are needed to make sensitivity
studies to estimate possible future changes, although they are
currently not fully evaluated and their deficiencies are obvious.
Therefore, the interpretation of such ‘predictions’ must be per-
formed with care. Progress will result from further development
of CCMs and from comparisons of results between models and
with observations. This will help to get a better understanding
of potential feedbacks in the atmosphere, thereby leading to
more reliable estimates of future changes.

The differences between the currently available CCM results
clearly indicate the uncertainties in the assessment of the future
development of polar ozone. In the NH the differences are more
pronounced than in the SH. Part of these differences arises from
the highly variable nature of the NH circulation, as is reflected
in the past record (Section 1.4.1). Until now, the different tran-
sient model predictions have been based on single realizations,
not ensembles, so it is not yet possible to determine whether
the differences between the models — with the sole exception
of the GISS results shown in Figure 1.17, which are signifi-
cantly different from the other model results — are statistically
significant. The time-slice simulations give some indication of
the range of natural variability that is possible, and allow for a
wide range of future possibilities. Nevertheless there are also
significant uncertainties arising from the performance of the un-
derlying dynamical models. Cold biases have been found in the
stratosphere of many of the models, with obvious direct conse-
quences for chemistry. In consequence, at the current stage of
model development, uncertainties in the details of PSC forma-
tion and sedimentation (denitrification) might be less important
than model temperature biases for simulating accurate ozone
amounts, although it is possible that the models underestimate
the sensitivity of chemical ozone loss to temperature changes.
However, because it has been shown that denitrification does
contribute significantly to Arctic ozone loss and is very sensitive
to temperature, both problems have to be solved before a reli-
able estimate of future Arctic ozone losses is possible. Further
investigations and model developments, combined with data
analysis, are needed in order to reduce or eliminate these vari-

ous model deficiencies and quantify the natural variability.

The trade-off or partial cancellation between direct and indi-

the global mean: the latitudinal forcing patterns actually com-

creases in halocarbons realize more positive forcing in the trop-

latitude of any applied forcing would likely mean that, even if

indicative of the equilibrium surface temperature change one
might have expected since then. Radiative forcing is not nec-
essarily indicative of patterns of temperature change, transient
temperature changes or other metrics. In reality, only 60-80%
of the temperature changes associated with the radiative forc-
ing shown in Figure 1.3 would have already been realized in
the observed surface warming of the last 150+ years (IPCC,
2001, Chapter 6). From any time period, such as the present,
future temperature changes will come from the combination of
temperatures continuing to respond to past radiative forcing and
any new changes to the radiative forcing. The rate of change of
radiative forcing is potentially more important for evaluating
short-term climate change and possibilities for mitigation than
the total radiative forcing. It is therefore useful to examine the
rate, as well as the total radiative forcing (Solomon and Daniel,
1996).

Two estimates are given for these latter emissions, one based on bank

for the SRES B1 and A1B scenarios (boundaries of the red shaded

"IPCC (2001) gives the value for the radiative forcing of strato-
spheric ozone as -0.15 W m®, with a range of +0.1 W m°. This
radiative forcing primarily arises from mid-and high-latitude
ozone depletion in the lower stratosphere (see Box 1.3). Past
calculations of this radiative forcing have extensively employed
observed trends in ozone. It is generally assumed that these ob-
served ozone trends have been caused entirely by emissions of
ODSs, so the negative radiative forcing of stratospheric ozone
can be thought of as ‘indirect’. For the ODSs it is possible to
calculate EESC values and use them to scale the ozone radia-
tive forcing (see Box 1.8). EESC values for different ODSs are
shown in Figure 1.18b. The indirect radiative forcing of each
ODS is shown in Figure 1.18c. These values have been calcu-
lated by assuming that EESC values above a 1979 background
level give a forcing that scales with the —-0.15 W m~best-esti-
mate forcing from Chapter 6 of IPCC (2001) over 1979-1997.
This calculation follows the approaches of Daniel er al. (1999)

As the production of ODSs has now essentially ceased
(WMO, 2003, Chapter 1), the principal issue for the emissions
of ODSs concerns the treatment of the ODS bank. The scenario
for ODSs in Figure 1.18a includes continued emissions of ODSs
from the ODS bank, and if these emissions from the bank could
be cut by recovering the ODSs, the radiative forcing time-series
could be somewhat altered. Figure 1.19 illustrates the role of
post-2004 releases from the ODS bank in continuing the ODS
radiative forcing, and compares it with the HFC radiative forc-
ing. If emissions of ODSs from the bank continue at their cur-
rent rate, ODS radiative forcing will still decrease. However,
for at least the next two decades, the continued emission from
the ODS bank is expected to have a comparable contribution
to the total radiative forcing with that of HFC emissions. This
calculation does not take into account the effect that ODSs have
on the stratospheric ozone radiative forcing, which is discussed
next.

"Section 1.2.2 discussed past changes and a future scenario
for the abundances of the ozone-depleting gases. Chapter 2 dis-
cusses a range of future scenarios for the substitute gases. In
this section we examine scenarios for future radiative forcing
of the ODSs themselves. One possible future scenario is the
AIB scenario from the Special Report on Emission Scenarios
(SRES; IPCC, 2000), which for the ODSs is consistent with the
Ab scenario from WMO (2003). Figure 1.18a shows a time-
series of radiative forcing for the different groups of gases for
this scenario. The figure shows that the current radiative forcing
from ODSs is beginning to decline. However, because of their
long lifetime in the atmosphere and their continued emission
from the ‘ODS bank’ (namely those ODSs that have already
been manufactured but have not yet been released into the at-
mosphere), they could dominate the radiative forcing for the
next four to five decades. In this scenario HFCs dominate the
radiative forcing by the end of the century, but this is only one

example of several possible scenarios (see Chapter 2).

The balance between direct and indirect radiative forcing
varies substantially between different classes of ODSs (Table
1.1). For the halons, the negative indirect forcing dominates
their very small positive direct effect, causing their net forcing
to be negative. In contrast, the CFCs and HCFCs have a net
positive radiative forcing, despite their associated ozone loss.

The scenario shown in Figure 1.18 assumes that concen-
trations of ODS substitutes will increase rapidly in the future
while those of the ODSs will decay. In that case, even though
the direct radiative forcing of the halocarbons would decrease
during the next few decades, the net forcing would actually in-
crease because of ozone recovery. (Note that the future posi-
tive forcing from ozone recovery is not included in the SRES
scenarios.) However, this increase in net forcing depends on
which scenario is used for the ODS substitutes. The detailed
quantification of the radiative forcing from the ODS substitutes
is discussed in Chapter 2.

"involved in assessing the role of halocarbons in climate. Direct
radiative forcing from halocarbons has risen sharply since
1980. However, ozone depletion has contributed a negative in-
direct forcing. Uncertainties in the magnitude of the indirect
forcing are sufficiently large that the net radiative forcing since
1980 may have either increased or decreased (Figure 1.18e).
The best estimate is that the indirect forcing has largely offset
the increase in the direct radiative forcing. This suggests that
surface temperatures over the last few decades would have in-
creased even more rapidly if stratospheric ozone depletion had
not occurred. However, it is important to note that ozone deple-
tion since 1980 is the result, in part, of ODS increases prior to
1980.

"¢ Human-made halocarbons, including chlorofluorocarbons
(CFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), hydrofluorocarbons
(HFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), are
effective absorbers of infrared radiation, so that even
small amounts of these gases contribute to the radiative
forcing of the climate system. Some of these gases and
their replacements also contribute to stratospheric ozone
depletion and to the deterioration of local air quality.
"	List
"HCFCs of industrial importance have lifetimes in the range
1.3—20 years. Their global-mean tropospheric concentrations
in 2003, expressed as molar mixing ratios (parts per trillion,
ppt, 10""), were 157 ppt for HCFC-22, 16 ppt for HCFC-
141b, and 14 ppt for HCFC-142b.

HFCs of industrial importance have lifetimes in the
range 1.4-270 years. In 2003 their observed atmospheric
concentrations were 17.5 ppt for HFC-23, 2.7 ppt for HFC-
125, 26 ppt for HFC-134a, and 2.6 ppt for HFC-152a.

The observed atmospheric concentrations of these HCFCs
and HFCs can be explained by anthropogenic emissions,
within the range of uncertainties in calibration and emission
estimates.

PFCs and SF, have lifetimes in the range 1000-50,000 years
and make an essentially permanent contribution to radiative
forcing. Concentrations in 2003 were 76 ppt for CF,, 2.9
ppt for C,F,, and 5 ppt for SF,. Both anthropogenic and
natural sources of CF, are needed to explain its observed
atmospheric abundance.

Global and regional emissions of CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs
have been derived from observed concentrations and can
be used to check emission inventory estimates. Global
emissions of HCFC-22 have risen steadily over the period
1975-2000, whereas those of HCFC-141b, HCFC-142b and
HFC-134a started to increase quickly in the early 1990s. In
Europe, sharp increases in emissions occurred for HFC-
134a over 1995-1998 and for HFC-152a over 1996-2000,
with some levelling off of both through 2003.

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and ammonia (NH,),
which are considered as replacement species for refrigerants
or foam blowing agents, have lifetimes of several months or
less, hence their distributions are spatially and temporally
variable. It is therefore difficult to quantify their climate
impacts with single globally averaged numbers. The direct
and indirect radiative forcings associated with their use as
substitutes are very likely to have a negligible effect on
global climate because of their small contribution to existing
VOC and NH, abundances in the atmosphere.

The lifetimes of many halocarbons depend on the
concentration of the hydroxyl radical (OH), which might
change in the 21st century as a result of changes in emissions
of carbon monoxide, natural and anthropogenic VOCs,
"	List

changes in tropospheric ultraviolet radiation. The sign and
magnitude of the future change in OH concentrations are
uncertain, and range from —18 to +5% for the year 2100,
depending on the emission scenario. For the same emissions
of halocarbons, a decrease in future OH would lead to
higher concentrations of these halocarbons and hence would
increase their radiative forcing, whereas an increase in
future OH would lead to lower concentrations and smaller
radiative forcing.

The ODSs have contributed 0.32 W m7? (13%) to the direct
radiative forcing of all well-mixed greenhouse gases, relative
to pre-industrial times. This contribution is dominated by
CFCs. The current (2003) contributions of HFCs and PFCs
to the total radiative forcing by long-lived greenhouse gases
are 0.0083 W m? (0.31%) and 0.0038 W m> (0.15%),
respectively.

Based on the emissions reported in Chapter 11 of this

is in the range of 0.019-0.030 W m* compared with the
range 0.022-0.025 W m” based on projections in the IPCC
Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES). Based on
SRES projections, the radiative forcing of HFCs and PFCs
corresponds to about 6-10% and 2%, respectively, of the
total estimated radiative forcing due to CFCs and HCFCs in
2015.

Projections of emissions over longer time scales become more
uncertain because of the growing influence of uncertainties
in technological practices and policies. However, based on
the range of SRES emission scenarios, the contribution of
HFCs to radiative forcing in 2100 could range from 0.1
to 0.25 W m® and of from PFCs 0.02 to 0.04 W m~. In
comparison, the forcing from carbon dioxide (CO,) in these
scenarios ranges from about 4.0 to 6.7 W m° in 2100.
Actions taken under the Montreal Protocol and_ its
Adjustments and Amendments have led to the replacement
of CFCs with HCFCs, HFCs, and other substances, and
to changing of industrial processes. These actions have
begun to reduce atmospheric chlorine loading. Because
replacement species generally have lower global warming
potentials (GWPs), and because total halocarbon emissions
have decreased, the total CO,-equivalent emission (direct
GWP-weighted using a 100-year time horizon) of all
halocarbons has also been reduced. The combined CO,-
equivalent emissions of CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs decreased
from a peak of about 7.5 + 0.4 GtCO,-eq yr! around 1990
to about 2.5 + 0.2 GtCO,-eq yr‘ in the year 2000, which
corresponds to about 10% of that year’s CO, emissions from
global fossil-fuel burning.

HFCs, PFCs, other replacement gases such as organic
compounds, and their degradation intermediates are not
expected to have a significant effect on global concentrations
of OH radicals (which essentially determine the tropospheric
self-cleaning capacity), because global OH concentrations
are much more strongly influenced by carbon monoxide,
methane and natural hydrocarbons.

The local impact of hydrocarbon and ammonia substitutes
for air-conditioning, refrigeration and foam-blowing
applications can be estimated by comparing their anticipated
emissions to local pollutant emissions from all sources.
Small but not negligible impacts could occur near highly
localized emission sources. However, even small impacts

¢ The climate impact of a given mass of a halocarbon emitted
to the atmosphere depends on its radiative properties and
atmospheric lifetime. The two can be combined to compute
the global warming potential (GWP), which is a proxy for
the climate effect of a gas relative to the emission of a pulse
of an equal mass of CO,. Multiplying emissions of a gas by
its GWP gives the CO,-equivalent emission of that gas over
a given time horizon.

¢ The GWP value of a gas is subject to change as better
estimates of the radiative forcing and the lifetime associated
with the gas or with the reference gas (CO,) become
available. The GWP values (over 100 years) recommended
in this report (Table 2.6) have been modified, depending on

in IPCC (1996), which were adopted by the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for

The intermediate degradation products of most long-
lived CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs have shorter lifetimes than
the source gases, and therefore have lower atmospheric
concentrations and smaller radiative forcing. Intermediate
products and final products are removed from the atmosphere
via deposition and washout processes and may accumulate
in oceans, lakes and other reservoirs.

Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) is a persistent degradation
product of some HFCs and HCFCs, with yields that are
known from laboratory studies. TFA is removed from the
atmosphere mainly by wet deposition. TFA is toxic to
some aquatic life forms at concentrations at concentrations
approaching | mg L”. Current observations show that the
typical concentration of TFA in the oceans is 0.2 pg L"", but
concentrations as high as 40 pg L"" have been observed in
the Dead Sea and Nevada lakes.

New studies based on measured concentrations of TFA in sea
water provide stronger evidence that the cumulative source
of TFA from the degradation of HFCs is smaller than natural
sources, which, however, have not been fully identified. The
available environmental risk assessment and monitoring data
indicate that the source of TFA from the degradation of HFCs
is not expected to result in environmental concentrations
capable of significant ecosystem damage.

of banks and end-of-life options for applications using
HCFCs and HFCs as well.

Current banked halocarbons will make a_ substantial
contribution to future radiative forcing of climate for
many decades unless a large proportion of these banks
is destroyed. Large portions of the global inventories of
CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs currently reside in banks. For
example, it is estimated that about 50% of the total global
inventory of HFC-134a currently resides in the atmosphere
and 50% resides in banks. One top-down estimate based
on past reported production and on detailed comparison
with atmospheric-concentration changes suggests that
if the current banks of CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs were to
be released to the atmosphere, their corresponding GWP-
weighted emissions (using a 100-year time horizon) would
represent about 2.6, 3.4 and 1.2 GtCO,-eq, respectively.

Tf all the ODSs in banks in 2004 were not released to the
atmosphere, the direct positive radiative forcing could be
reduced by about 0.018-0.025 W m? by 2015. Over the
next two decades this positive radiative forcing change is
expected to be about 4-5% of that due to carbon dioxide
emissions over the same period.

Individual removal processes have various impacts on differ-
ent gases in different regions of the atmosphere. The dominant
process (the one with the fastest removal rate) controls the local
loss of a gas. For example, reaction with OH is the dominant re-
moval process for many hydrogenated halocarbons in both the
troposphere and stratosphere. For those same gases, reactions
with O('D) and Cl play a large role only in the stratosphere. The
determination of the spatial distribution of the sink strength of a
trace gas is of interest because it is relevant to both the calcula-
tion of the atmospheric lifetime and the environmental impact
of the substance. The lifetimes of atmospheric trace gases have
been recently re-assessed by the IPCC (2001, Chapter 4) and by
the WMO Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion (WMO,
2003, Chapter 1). Below is an updated summary of key features
and methods used to determine the lifetimes.

"To evaluate the environmental impact of a given gas molecule,
one needs to know, first, how long it remains in the atmosphere.
CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs, PFCs, hydrofluoroethers (HFEs), HCs
and other replacement species for ODSs are chemically trans-
formed or physically removed from the atmosphere after their
release. Known sinks for halocarbons and replacement gases
include photolysis; reaction with the hydroxyl radical (OH),
the electronically excited atomic oxygen (O('D)) and atomic
chlorine (Cl); uptake in oceanic surface waters through dissolu-
tion; chemical and biological degradation processes; biological
degradation in soils; and possibly surface reactions on minerals.
For other trace gases, such as NH,, uptake by aerosols, cloud
removal, aqueous-phase chemistry, and surface deposition also
provide important sink processes. A schematic of the various
removal processes affecting the atmospheric concentration of

"The total amount, or burden, of a gas in the atmosphere is
determined by the competing processes of its emission into and
its removal from the atmosphere. Whereas emissions of most
of the gases considered here are primarily a result of human
activities, their rates of removal are largely determined by com-
plex natural processes that vary both spatially and temporally,
and may differ from gas to gas. Rapid removal implies a short
atmospheric lifetime, whereas slow removal and therefore a
longer lifetime means that a given emission rate will result in a
larger atmospheric burden. The concept of the atmospheric life-
time of a gas, which summarizes its destruction patterns in the
atmosphere, is therefore central to understanding its atmospher-
ic accumulation. Section 2.2 discusses atmospheric lifetimes,
how they are calculated, their influence on the global distribu-
tion of halocarbons, and their use in evaluating the effects of
various species on the ozone layer and climate change under
different future scenarios. Section 2.3 discusses the observed
atmospheric abundance of CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs and PFCs, as
well as emissions derived from these observations. Section 2.4
discusses the decomposition products (e.g., trifluoroacetic acid,
TFA) of these species and their possible effects on ecosystems.

Chlorine and bromine released from chlorofluorocarbons

of the ozone layer in the stratosphere. Anthropogenic emissions
of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and other green-

to the change in radiative forcing of the climate system over
the past 150 years. The possible adverse effects of both global
environmental issues are being dealt with in different political
arenas. The Vienna Convention and the Montreal Protocol are
designed to protect the ozone layer, whereas the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and
the Kyoto Protocol play the same role for the climate system.
However these two environmental issues interact both with
respect to the trade-off in emissions of species as technology
evolves, and with respect to the chemical and physical proc-

of these interactions and their effects on ozone are discussed
in Chapter 1. This chapter focuses on the atmospheric abun-

ments and emission estimates and suggested that the trend in
global OH over that period was —0.66 + 0.57% yr“. Prinn and
Huang (2001) analyzed the record only from 1978 to 1993 and
deduced a trend of +0.3% yr“ using the same emissions as Krol
et al. (1998). These results through 1993 are essentially consist-
ent with the conclusions of Krol et al. (1998, 2001), who used
the same measurements and emission record but an independ-
ent calculation technique to infer a trend of +0.46 + 0.6% yr‘
between 1978 and 1994. However, Prinn et al. (2001) inferred
a larger interannual and inter-decadal variability in global OH
than Krol et al. (1998, 2001). Prinn et al. (2001) also inferred
that OH concentrations in the late 1990s were lower than
those in the late 1970s to early 1980s, in agreement with the
longer CH,CCI, lifetime reported by Montzka er al. (2000) for
1998-1999 relative to the Prinn et al. (2001) value for the full-
period average. A recent study by Krol and Lelieveld (2003)
indicated a larger variation of OH of +12% during 1978-1990,
followed by a decrease slightly larger than 12% in the decade
1991-2000. Over the entire 1978-2000 period, the study found
that the overall change was close to zero.

"For several species other sink processes are also important in
determining their global lifetime in the atmosphere. One such
process is wet deposition (scavenging by atmospheric hydro-
meteors including cloud and fog drops, rain and snow), which
is an important sink for NH,. In general, scavenging by large-
scale and convective precipitation has the potential to limit the
upward transport of gases and aerosols from source regions.

"Stratospheric in situ sinks for halocarbons and ODS replace-
ments include photolysis and homogeneous gas-phase reactions
with OH, Cl and O('D). Because about 90% of the burden of
well-mixed gases resides in the troposphere, stratospheric re-
moval does not contribute much to the atmospheric lifetimes of
gases that are removed efficiently in the troposphere. For most
of the HCFCs and HFCs considered in this report, stratospheric
removal typically accounts for less than 10% of the total loss.
However, stratospheric removal is important for determining the
spatial distributions of a source gas and its degradation products
"	Text
"in the stratosphere. These distributions depend on the competi-
tion between local photochemical removal processes and the
transport processes that carry the material from the entry point
(mainly at the tropical tropopause) to the upper stratosphere and
the extra-tropical lower stratosphere. Observations show that
the stratospheric mixing ratios of source gases decrease with
altitude and can be described at steady-state by a local exponen-
tial scale height at each latitude. Theoretical calculations show
that the local scale height is proportional to the square root of
the local lifetime (Ehhalt et al., 1998).

Previous studies (Hansen et al., 1997; Christidis et al., 1997;
Jain et al., 2000) showed that depending on the values of the as-
sumed scale height in the stratosphere, the calculated radiative
forcing for CFC-11 can differ by as much as 30%. Thus, accu-
rate determination of the GWP of a gas also requires knowing
its scale height in the stratosphere. Again, observations will be
useful for verifying model-calculated scale heights. Other diag-
nostics, such as the age of air (see glossary), will improve our
confidence in the models’ ability to simulate the transport in the
atmosphere and accurately predict the scale heights appropriate
for radiative forcing calculations.

"Because of its dependence on CH, and other pollutants, the
concentration of tropospheric OH is likely to have changed
since the pre-industrial era and is expected to change in the
future. Pre-industrial OH is likely to have been different than
it is today, but because of the counteracting effects of higher
concentrations of CO and CH, (which decrease OH) and higher
concentrations of NO, and O, (which increase OH) there is lit-
tle consensus on the magnitude or even the sign of this change.
Several model studies have suggested that weighted global
mean OH has decreased from pre-industrial time to the present
day by less than 10% (Berntsen et al., 1997; Wang and Jacob,
1998; Shindell et a/., 2001; Lelieveld et al., 2002). Other studies
have reported larger decreases in global OH of 16% (Mickley
et al., 1999) and 33% (Hauglustaine and Brasseur, 2001). The
model study by Lelieveld er al. (2002) suggests that during the
past century OH concentrations decreased substantially in the
marine troposphere by reaction with CH, and CO; however, on
a global scale, this decrease has been offset by an increase over
the continents associated with large emissions of NO,

"As for future changes in OH, the IPCC (2001, Chapter
4) used scenarios reported in the IPCC Special Report on
Emissions Scenarios (SRES, IPCC, 2000) and a comparison
of results from 14 models to predict that global OH could de-
crease by 10% to 18% by 2100 for five emission scenarios, and
increase by 5% for one scenario that assumed large decreases
in CH, and other ozone precursor emissions. Based on a dif-
ferent emission scenario Wang and Prinn (1999) projected a
decrease in OH concentrations of 16 + 3%. In addition to emis-
sion changes, future increases in direct and indirect green-
house gases could also induce changes in OH through direct
participation in OH-controlling chemistry, indirectly through
stratospheric ozone changes that could change solar ultraviolet
in the troposphere, and potentially through climate change ef-
fects on biogenic emissions, temperature, humidity and clouds.
Changes in tropospheric water could have important chemi-
cal repercussions, because the reaction between water vapour
and electronically excited oxygen atoms constitutes the major
source of tropospheric OH (Reaction [2.1]). So in a warmer and
potentially wetter climate, the abundance of OH is expected to
increase.

Perfluorinated compounds, such as PFCs, SF, and SF.CF,,
have limited use as ODS replacements is limited (see Chapter
10). The carbon-fluorine bond is remarkably strong and resist-
ant to chemical attack. Atmospheric removal processes for
PFCs are extremely slow and these compounds have lifetimes
measured in thousands of years. Photolysis at short wave-
lengths (e.g., Lyman-a at 121.6 nm in the mesosphere) was
first suggested to be a possible degradation pathway for CF,
(Cicerone, 1979). Other possible reactions with O('D), H atoms
and OH radicals, and combustion in high-temperature systems
(e.g., incinerators, engines) were considered (Ravishankara
et al., 1993). Reactions with electrons in the mesosphere and
with ions were further considered by Morris ef al. (1995), and
a review of the importance of the different processes has been
carried out (WMO, 1995). More recently, the degradation proc-
esses of SF,CF, were studied (Takahashi er al., 2002). The rate
constant for its reaction with OH was found to be less than 10-'
cm? molecules“ and can be neglected. The main degradation
process for CF, and C,F, is probably the reaction with O* in the
mesosphere, but destruction in high-temperature combustion
systems remains the principal near-surface removal process. In
the case of c-C,F,, SF, and SF.CF,, the main degradation proc-
esses are reaction with electrons and photolysis, whereas C.F,
degradation would mainly occur by photolysis at 121.6 nm.

Dry deposition, which is the transfer of trace gases and
aerosols from the atmosphere onto surfaces in the absence of
precipitation, is also important to consider for some species,
particularly NH,. Dry deposition is governed by the level of
turbulence in the atmosphere, the solubility and reactivity of the
species, and the nature of the surface itself.
"	Text
"This effect is largely controlled by the solubility of a species
in water and its uptake in ice. Crutzen and Lawrence (2000)
noted that the solubilities of most of the HCFCs, HFCs and HCs
considered in this chapter are too low for significant scavenging
to occur. However, because NH, is largely removed by liquid-
phase scavenging at pH lower than about 7, its lifetime is con-
trolled by uptake on aerosol and cloud drops.

"The steady-state lifetimes used in this report and reported in

Chapter 1). Chemical reaction coefficients and photodissocia-
tion rates used by WMO (2003, Chapter 1) to calculate atmos-
pheric lifetimes for gases destroyed by tropospheric OH are
mainly from the latest NASA/JPL evaluations (Sander et al.,
2000, 2003). These rate coefficients are sensitive to atmospher-
ic temperature and can be significantly faster near the surface
than in the upper troposphere. The global mean abundance of
OH cannot be directly measured, but a weighted average of the
OH sink for certain synthetic trace gases (whose budgets are
well established and whose total atmospheric sinks are essen-
tially controlled by OH) can be derived. The ratio of the atmos-
pheric lifetimes against tropospheric OH loss for a gas is scaled

"Irreversible deposition is facilitated by the dynamics of
tropospheric mixing, which expose tropospheric air to contact
with the surface. Irreversible deposition can occur through or-
ganisms in ocean surface waters that can both consume and
produce halocarbons; chemical degradation of dissolved halo-
carbons through hydrolysis; and physical dissolution of halocar-
bons into ocean waters, which does not represent a significant
sink for most halocarbons. These processes are highly variable
in the ocean, and depend on physical processes of the ocean
mixed layer, temperature, productivity, surface saturation and
other variables. Determining a net global sink through obser-
vation is a difficult task. Yvon-Lewis and Butler (2002) have
constructed a high-resolution model of the ocean surface layer,
which included its interaction with the atmosphere, and physi-
cal, chemical and biological ocean processes. They examined
ocean uptake for a range of halocarbons, using known solubili-
ties and chemical and biological degradation rates. Their results
show that lifetimes of atmospheric HCFCs and HFCs with re-
spect to hydrolysis in sea water are very long, and range from
hundreds to thousands of years. Therefore, they found that for
most HFCs and HCFCs the ocean sink was insignificant com-
pared with in situ atmospheric sinks. However, both atmospher-
ic CH,CCI, and CCL, have shorter (and coincidentally the same)
oceanic- -loss lifetimes of 94 years, which must be included in

determining the total lifetimes of these compounds.

HFCs were developed as replacements for CFCs and have
a relatively short emission history. Their concentrations are
currently significantly lower than those of the most abundant
CFCs, but are increasing rapidly. HFC-134a and HFC-23 are
the most abundant species, with HFC-134a growing most rap-

idly at a mean rate of almost 20% yr since 2000.

Observations of PFCs are sparse and growth ra rates are not re-
ported here. CF, is by far the most abundant species in this group.
About half of the current abundance of CF, arises from alumin-
ium production and the electronics industry. Measurements of
CF, in ice cores have revealed a natural source, which accounts
for the other half of current abundances (Harnisch et al., 1996).
The level of SF, continues to rise, at a rate of about 5% yr.

processed through the AGAGE 12-box model (Prinn et al., 2000; updates provided by D. Cunnold). The CMDL abundances are area-weighted
global means for the lower troposphere (from http://www.cmdl.noaa.gov/hats/index.html), estimated as 12-month averages centred around |

"Emissions of halocarbons can be inferred from observations
of their concentrations in the atmosphere when their loss rates
are accurately known. Such estimates can be used to validate
and verify emission-inventory data produced by industries and
reported by parties of international regulatory conventions.
The atmospheric emissions of halocarbons estimated in emis-
sion inventories are based on compilations of global halocar-
bon production (AFEAS, 2004), sales into each end-use and
the time schedule for atmospheric emission from each end-use
(McCulloch er al., 2001, 2003). Uncertainties arise if the global
production figures do not cover all manufacturing countries and
if there are variations in the behaviour of the end-use categories.
For some halocarbons, there are no global emission inventory
estimates. Observed concentrations are often the only means
of verifying halocarbon emission inventories and the emissions
from the ‘banks’ of each halocarbon.

Global emissions based on AGAGE and CMDL data have
been estimated using a 2-D 12-box model and an optimal
linear least-squares Kalman filter. Emissions of HFC-134a,
HCFC-141b and HCFC-142b over the period 1992-2000
were estimated by Huang and Prinn (2002) using AGAGE and
NOAA-CMDL measurements. They compared them to indus-
try (AFEAS) estimates and concluded that there are significant
differences for HCFC-141b and HCFC-142b, but not for HFC-
134a. Later O’Doherty et al. (2004) used AGAGE data and the
same model to infer global emissions of the same species plus
HCFC-22. They found a fair agreement between emission es-
timates based on consumption and on their measurements for
HCFC-22, with the former exceeding the latter by about 10%
during parts of the 1990s. Emissions for CFC-11, CFC-12,
CFC-113, CCI, and HCFC-22 have been computed from global
observations and compared with industry estimates by Cunnold
et al. (1997) and Prinn et al. (2000), with updates by WMO
(2003, Chapter 1). The general conclusion was that emissions
estimated in this way are with few exceptions consistent with
expectations from the Montreal Protocol.

Figure 2.4. Global annual emissions (in kt yr-') inferred from the mole fractions in Figure 2.3. Emissions are estimated using a 1-box model.
In addition, the AGAGE 12-box model has been used to infer emissions from the AGAGE network (Prinn et al., 2000; updates provided by D.
Cunnold). A time-dependent scaling for each component, taking into account the vertical distribution in the troposphere and the stratosphere,
has been adopted in all the estimates. These scaling factors are taken from the AGAGE 12-box model. Emissions of HFC-23 are based on a 2-D
model (Oram et al., 1998, with updates). The inferred emissions are compared with emissions from AFEAS and EDGAR (see references in the
text) when those were available.

This method has been employed to infer global emissions
in a range of studies. For example, Héhne and Harnisch (2002)
found that the calculated emissions of HFC-134a were in good
agreement with reported emissions in the 1990-1995 period,
whereas the emissions inferred for SF, were considerably
lower than those reported to the UNFCCC. In a recent paper
by Culbertson et al. (2004) the 1-box model was used to in-
fer emissions for several CF,-containing compounds, includ-
ing CFC-115, Halon-1301, HFC-23, HFC-143a and HFC-134a,
using flask samples from Oregon, Alaska and Antarctica. The
emissions calculated in their study generally agreed well with
emissions from other studies. They also provided first estimates
of emissions of some rarer gases, such as s CFC- 13 and C,F,.

"In general the results presented in Figures 2.3 and 2.4 con-
firm the findings of previous studies. The global emission esti-
mates presented in Figure 2.4 show a clear downward trend for
most compounds regulated by the Montreal Protocol. Inferred
emissions for the HCFCs have been rising strongly since 1990
and those of HCFC-141b and HCFC-142b have levelled off
from 2000 onwards. However, emissions of the HFCs have
been growing in most cases, most noticeably for HFC-134a,
HFC-125 and HFC-152a. In contrast to the other HFCs, emis-
sions of HFC-23 began several decades before the others (Oram
et al., 1998) because of its release as a byproduct of HCFC-22
production. Its emissions have increased slightly over the last

decade.

"Formally, the application of halocarbon observations to the de-
termination of regional emissions is an inverse problem. Some
investigations have treated the problem in this way and used
observations to constrain global or regional sources or sinks. In
other approaches, the problem has been solved in a direct man-

lation has been used to work back to the emissions estimated
to support and explain the observations. Both approaches have
been applied to halocarbons and both have advantages and dis-

have been greater than 20 kt yr! during 2000, based on aircraft

reanalysis of the observations at Mace Head and Jungfraujoch,
Switzerland, gave emissions in the range 0.3-3.4 kt yr! for
2000-2002 (Reimann et al., 2004). The reasons for the signifi-
cant differences between the estimates of European emissions
based on long-term observations and those from the EXPORT

restricted to four days in the summer of 2000, so they were
more prone to the potential influence of regional events of lim-

- Estimates of halocarbon emissions for North America have
been made by Bakwin et al. (1997) and Hurst et al. (1998) us-
ing the simultaneous high-frequency measurements of perchlo-
roethylene (C,Cl,) and a range of halocarbons made on a 610 m
tall tower in North Carolina. The North American halocarbon
source strengths for 1995 were 12.9 kt yr! for CFC-11, 49 kt yr-
‘for CFC-12, 3.9 kt yr! for CFC-113, 47.9 kt yr for CH,CCL,,
and 2.2 kt yr! for CCI,, as reported by Bakwin et al. (1997),
and these estimates are significantly lower than the emission
inventory estimates of McCulloch et al. (2001). Downwards
trends are reported for North American emissions of the major
anthropogenic halocarbons (Hurst et al., 1998).

of the degradation products from emissions of the parent com-
pounds is discussed in Section 2.4.1.2. Although each chemical
has to be evaluated on its own, three general remarks are use-
ful in framing the following discussion. First, fluorine-contain-
ing radicals produced in the atmospheric degradation of HFCs,
HFEs and PFCs do not participate in catalytic ozone destruc-
tion cycles (Ravishankara et al., 1994; Wallington et al., 1995).
Hence, the ozone depletion potentials (ODPs) of HFCs, HFEs,
and PFCs are essentially zero. In contrast, HCFCs contain chlo-
rine and consequently have non-zero ODPs. Second, the emis-
sions of HCFCs, HFCs and HFEs are very small compared with
the mass of hydrocarbons released into the atmosphere, and the
atmospheric lifetime of most HCFCs, HFCs, HFEs and PFCs
allows their effective dispersal. As a result the concentrations of
the degradation products of HCFCs, HFCs, HFEs and PFCs are
small and their impact on local and regional air quality (i.e., on
tropospheric ozone) is negligible (Hayman and Derwent, 1997).
Third, the ultimate atmospheric fate of all HCFCs, HFCs, HFEs
and PFCs is oxidation to halogenated carbonyl compounds and
HF, which are transferred via dry deposition and wet deposition
(rain-out or washout) from the atmosphere to the hydrosphere.
The impact of these compounds on terrestrial ecosystems and
the hydrosphere (e.g., lakes, oceans) needs to be considered.

Degradation is initiated by the gas-phase reaction with hy-
droxyl (OH) radicals. This process, which involves either H-
atom abstraction from C-H groups, or addition to unsaturated
>C=C< groups, is the slowest step in the atmospheric degrada-
tion process. There is a large database of rate coefficients for
reactions of OH radicals with halogenated compounds (Sander
et al. 2000, 2003), which provides a means of estimating tropo-
spheric lifetimes for these compounds. Moreover, this database
allows rate coefficients to be estimated (typically within a fac-
tor of about two) for compounds for which no experimental
data are available. Reaction with OH generates a radical, which
adds O, rapidly (within 10° s) to give a peroxy radical.

The environmental impact of HCFCs and HFCs is deter-
mined mainly by the tropospheric lifetimes and emission rates of
the parent compounds and by the halogenated carbonyl! species
formed as oxidation products in the atmosphere. The general
scheme for the tropospheric degradation of HCFCs and HFCs
into halogenated carbonyl compounds is outlined below. Figure
2.5a shows the degradation mechanism for a generic two-carbon
HCFC or HFC. Figure 2.5b shows similar data for C,F,OCH,
as an example HFE. The oxidation products of HCFCs, HFCs,
HFEs and PFCs are not routinely measured in the atmosphere
so their concentrations need to be estimated. There are some
measurements of the concentrations of the degradation product

an a-H atom is available (e.g., in CF,CFHO). In the case of the

Although there have been no studies of the degradation

essentially the same fluorinated radical species that are formed

Removal of HCFCs and HFCs is initiated by gas-phase re-

years, whereas the first generation degradation products are
removed by rain and clouds, with local lifetimes that are typi-

degradation products will be much smaller (approximately 100
to 1000 times) than the source gas. Short-lived intermediate
degradation products such as halogenated carbonyl compounds
will be present at extremely low atmospheric concentrations.

samples around the globe, for example, in the USA, Germany,
Israel, Ireland, France, Switzerland, Austria, Russia, South Africa

to be a ubiquitous component of the contemporary hydrosphere.
TFA is reported in concentrations of about 200 ng L™ in ocean
water down to depths of several thousand meters (Frank et al.,
2002). If 200 ng L“ is the average concentration of TFA in all
ocean water, the oceans contain around 3 x 10° t of TFA. With an
anthropogenic contribution of 10,266 t yr‘ it would have taken
approximately 3400 years to achieve the present TFA concentra-

"TFA is produced during the atmospheric degradation of several
CFC replacements, and partitions into the aqueous compart-
ments of the environment (Bowden et al., 1996). Reaction with
OH radicals in the gas phase accounts for 10-20% of the loss of
TFA (M@gelberg et al., 1994). The major fate of TFA is rain-out.
The environmental impact of TFA has been studied thoroughly
and results have been reviewed in the UNEP effects-assessment
reports of 1998 (Tang et al., 1998) and 2002 (Solomon et al.,
2003). TFA is highly soluble in water, is a strong acid with Pka
of 0.23 and the logarithm of its n-octanol/water partition coef-
ficient is -0.2, which indicates that it will essentially partition in
the water compartment and will not bioaccumulate in animals.
Little accumulation (concentration factor of approximately 10)
occurs in plants exposed to TFA. Ina long-term study (90 weeks)
(Kim et al., 2000) it was shown that TFA could be biodegraded
in an engineered anaerobic waste-water treatment system at a
TFA concentration up to 30 mg L"" (as fluoride). However, it
is unclear how this result should be extrapolated to natural en-
vironments, where concentrations of TFA and nutrients will be
different. Ellis et al. (2001) observed no significant degrada-

no significant abiotic degradation process has been identified

ecotoxicity studies showed that the most sensitive standard

"Because of the persistence of TFA, it has been suggested that
it could accumulate in aquatic ecosystems like vernal pools or
seasonal wetlands, which dry out periodically, are replenished
by rainfall and are presumed to have little or no seepage (Tromp
et al., 1995). A sensitivity study (Tromp et al., 1995) based on
mathematical modelling suggested that such accumulation
could take place if a series of conditions (a polluted area with
high atmospheric concentrations of the precursors and the OH
radical; pollution and rainfall events that occur at the same time;
and little, or no, seepage) could be maintained simultaneously
for several decades. An example cited by the authors indicated
that if the concentration of TFA in rain water was assumed to
be 1 pg L"", and the loss frequencies were 5 yr for evaporation
and of 0.1 yr! for seepage, the TFA concentration could reach
100 pg L (which corresponds to the no-effect concentration of
the most sensitive aquatic species) in 30 years. The probability
that such a combination of events would be maintained over
several decades appears to be rather low (Solomon et al., 2003).
Studies of pond water (Tang ef al., 1998) confirmed TFA’s per-
sistent behaviour but did not find significant accumulation. TFA
evapoconcentration was observed during two years in 1998 and
1999 in vernal pools in California (Cahill et a/., 2001). Some
TFA retention was also observed between the years 1998 and
1999 but was not easily quantified. Cahill et a/. (2001) sug-
gested that in very wet years surface-water export may occur
and may limit long-term TFA accumulation. Concentrations ob-
served at the beginning of the study in January 1998 were about
130 ng L"" (in the range of expected rain-water concentrations)
and suggest that accumulation was not maintained in previous
years. Although some accumulation is likely in such systems
because of TFA persistence, observations indicate that the spe-
cific conditions required for accumulation in seasonal wetlands
are unlikely to be maintained for several decades.

The global warming potential is a relative index used to compare the climate impact of an emitted greenhouse gas, relative
to an equal amount of carbon dioxide.

Substances with very long lifetimes, such as PFCs and
SF 3 have contributions that may exceed these time scales, and
hence the use of GWP may be inadequate for these species.
Conversely, one should be cautious about using the derived
GWP values for gases with lifetimes shorter than 5 years that
may not be uniformly mixed in the atmosphere, although the
concept may be used to some extent for short-lived species and
can be applied to the calculation of indirect contributions as ad-
dressed in Section 2.5.3.

"The discussion in the preceding sections describes methods to
evaluate the direct radiative impact of emission of a source gas
that has a sufficiently long lifetime so that it has a uniform mix-
ing ratio in the troposphere. This section considers two aspects
of GWP calculations that are not covered by these methods.
First, the direct impact refers only to the greenhouse warming
arising from the accumulation of the source gas in the atmos-
phere, but does not consider its other radiatively important
byproducts. There could be indirect effects if the degradation
products of the gas also behaved like greenhouse gases (Section
2.5.3.1), or if the presence of the emitted gas and its degradation
products affected the distribution of other greenhouse gases
(Section 2.5.3.2). Second, the special case of very short-lived
source gases with non-uniform mixing ratios in the troposphere
will be discussed (Section 2.5.3.3).

The indirect radiative effects of the source gas include the di-
rect effects from its degradation products. As was discussed in
Section 2.4.1 the local concentrations of most degradation prod-
ucts, with very few exceptions, are a factor of 100 (or more)
smaller than that of the source gas. Assuming that the values for
the radiative forcing of the source gas and its degradation prod-
ucts are similar, the indirect GWP from the degradation prod-
ucts should be much smaller than the direct GWP of the source
gas except for cases where the local lifetime of the degradation
product is longer than that of the source gas. CO, is one of the
final degradation products of organic compounds. However the
magnitude of the indirect GWP attributed to CO, is equal to the
number of carbons atoms in the original molecule, and is small
compared with the direct GWP values of most of the halocar-
bons given in Table 2.6.

"The measured spectroscopic data are then implemented
into a radiative transfer model to compute the radiative fluxes.
Several radiative-transfer models are available, ranging from
line-by-line to wide-bands models, depending on the spectral
interval over which the calculation is performed. Apart from
the uncertainties stemming from the cross-sections themselves,
differences in the flux calculation can arise from the spectral
resolution used; tropopause heights; vertical, spatial and sea-
sonal distributions of the gases; cloud cover; and how strat-
ospheric temperature adjustments are performed. The impact of
these parameters on radiative forcing calculations is discussed
in comprehensive studies such as Christidis et al. (1997),
Hansen et al. (1997), Myhre and Stordal (1997), Freckleton

"Halocarbons exhibit strong absorption bands in the thermal
infrared atmospheric window (see Figure 2.6) because of their
various vibrational modes. Absorption spectra of CFCs and the
majority of proposed substitutes are characterized by absorp-
tion bands rather than lines, because individual spectral lines
for these heavy molecules are overlapping and not resolved at
tropospheric pressures and temperatures. For each gas, the ab-
sorption cross-sections (in cm? per molecule) are derived from
laboratory measurements for specific atmospheric conditions.
Several independent measurements of absorption cross-sec-
tions for halocarbons have been reported in the literature (e.g.,
McDaniel et al., 1991; Clerbaux er al., 1993; Clerbaux and
Colin, 1994; Varanasi et al., 1994; Pinnock et al., 1995; Barry

al., 2001; Orkin et al., 2003; Nemtchinov and Varanasi, 2004;
Hurley et al., 2005"") and some of these data sets are available
through the widely used molecular spectroscopic databases,
such as HITRAN (Rothman et al., 2003) and GEISA (Jacquinet-
Husson et al., 1999). The intercomparison of measured cross-
sections and integrated absorption intensities performed on
the same molecule by different groups provides an estimate
of the discrepancies among the obtained results, and hence of
the measurement accuracy (e.g., Ballard et al., 2000; Forster et
al., 2005). Although the discrepancies between different cross-
section measurements can reach 40% (Hurley et al., 2005), it
is recognized that the typical uncertainties associated with the
measured cross-section when integrated over the infrared spec-
tral range are less than 10%.

of methane oxidation and promoting the build-up of methane.
Therefore, emissions of organic compounds, including HCFCs,
HFCs and some of their replacement gases, may lead to the
build-up of two important greenhouse trace gases, methane and
ozone, and consequently may cause an indirect radiative forc-
ing (e.g., Lelieveld et a/., 1998; Johnson and Derwent, 1996;
Fuglestvedt et al., 1999). The main factors influencing the
magnitudes of such indirect radiative impacts were found to be
their spatial emission patterns, chemical reactivity and trans-
port, molecular complexity, and the oxidation products formed
(Collins et al., 2002).

Assigning GWP values to very short-lived (VSL) species (spe-
cies with a lifetime of a month or shorter) presents a special
challenge (WMO, 2003, Chapter 2). Because of their short life-
times VSL species are not uniformly distributed in the tropo-
sphere. Their distributions depend on where and when (during
the year) they are emitted. Thus, it is not possible to assign a
single steady-state change in burden in the troposphere per
unit mass emission. In calculating the local change in radiative
forcing, one would have to use their actual three-dimensional
distributions. Furthermore, it is not obvious how one would es-
timate the change in surface temperature from the local changes
in forcing. In a sense, the issue is similar to the situation for
aerosol forcing. In such cases, the notion of GWP may prove
less useful and one would have to examine the local climate
impact directly, along with other indirect effects, such as ozone
and aerosol formation.

ways:

1.

The net GWP is most useful for comparing the relative
radiative effects of different ODSs when emitted at the same
time. In the type of calculations that may be performed in the
following chapters, one may come across a situation where
the GWP weighted emissions from several well-mixed
greenhouse gases and ODSs add to zero. It is important to
recognize that the result does not guarantee zero climate
impact.

2. The amount of ozone depletion caused by an incremental

emission of an ODS depends on the equivalent effective
stratospheric chlorine (EESC) loading in the atmosphere.
The concept of EESC has long been used to assess the effect
of halocarbon emissions on the ozone-depleting effect of
halogens in the stratosphere (Prather and Watson, 1990;
Chapter 1 of WMO, 2003 and references therein; and Figure
1.18 in Chapter 1 of this report). Ozone depletion first began
to be observable around 1980, and the date when EESC is
projected to fall below its 1980 value can provide a rough
estimate of the effects of emissions on the time scale for
ozone recovery, assuming no changes in other parameters,
such as atmospheric circulation or chemical composition.
Chapter | of this report assesses in detail the factors that are
likely to influence the date of ozone recovery, intercompares
model estimates of the date, and discusses uncertainties in
its absolute value. EESC is used here to indicate the relative
effect of several different future emission scenarios on the
date of ozone recovery, but not to identify the absolute value
of the date. Current projections based on emission scenarios
indicate that the threshold values for EESC will be achieved
between 2043 and 2046, when there will be no further
ozone depletion for incremental ODS emission. Because
the indirect forcing of ODSs becomes zero after the EESC
threshold is reached, indirect GWPs for emissions prior
to that time decrease as they occur closer to the recovery
threshold. Indirect GWPs for emissions that occur after the
threshold is reached are zero.

more recent published data were available (Gohar et al., 2004;
Forster et al., 2005). Current values differ from the previously
reported values (IPCC, 2001) by amounts ranging from —37%
(HFC-123) to +43% (Halon-1211), mostly because of lifetime
updates. For completeness, the GWP values as reported in
IPCC (1996) — that is, the values adopted under the UNFCCC
for the national inventories — are also provided for the 100-year
time horizon. Relative to the values reported in IPCC (1996),
the recommended GWPs (for the 100-year time horizon) have
been modified from —16% (HCFC-123) to +51% (HFC-236fa),
depending on the gas, with an average change of +15%. Most
of these changes occur because of the updated AGWP of CO,
used in IPCC (2001).

For the time frame up to 2100, the emissions from the IPCC
SRES scenarios were used in IPCC (2001) to estimate a range
of radiative forcings possible for HFCs and PFCs. The indi-
vidual radiative forcings of the HFCs are plotted in Figure 2.8
using the B1 and A1B scenarios, which represent the low and a

HFCs were derived by Ashford er al. (2004) (see also Chapter

ing of CFCs and HCFCs are based on WMO (2003, Chapter

tive forcing of PFCs in 2015 is about 0.006 W m? based on
SRES projections. The HFC and PFC radiative forcing corre-
sponds to about 6—-10% and 2%, respectively, of the total esti-
mated radiative forcing due to CFCs and HCFCs in 2015 (esti-
mated at 0.297 W m” for the baseline scenario). Alternatively,
the HFC and PFC radiative forcing corresponds to about 0.8%
and 0.2%, respectively, of the estimated radiative forcing of all
well-mixed greenhouse gases, with a contribution of the ODSs
of about 10%.

NMHCs can have an indirect radiative forcing through
tropospheric chemistry interactions. As described in Section
2.5.3.2, methane concentrations increase when the hydroxyl
radicals are consumed by the more reactive organic compounds
emitted during anthropogenic activities. The photochemical
production of ozone, also a greenhouse gas, is also enhanced
by an increased burden of NMHCs. Indirect GWPs for some
alkanes and alkenes have been estimated from global averages
by Collins et al. (2002) and are given in Table 2.8. This study
also considered the increase in CO, as a result of the oxida-
tion of these compounds. The GWPs attributed to the indirect
chemical effects are much more important than their direct con-
tribution to radiative forcing. However, the indirect GWPs of
the alkanes and alkenes considered as replacement refrigerants
are relatively small compared with other non-ozone-depleting
halocarbons, and are highly uncertain. This uncertainty arises
because the indirect radiative impacts of alkanes and alkenes
depend strongly on the location and season of the emission, so
it is difficult to give a single number that covers all circum-
stances and eventualities. The indirect GWPs in Table 2.8 are
meant to be averages over the year for hydrocarbons emitted in
polluted environments in the major Northern Hemisphere con-
tinents.

Continued observations of CFCs and other ODSs in the at-
mosphere enable improved validation of estimates of the lag
between production and emission to the atmosphere, and of
the associated banks of these gases. Because the production of
ODSs has been greatly reduced, annual changes in concentra-
tions of those gases widely used in applications — such as refrig-
eration, air conditioning, and foam blowing — are increasingly
dominated by releases from existing banks. For example, CFC-
11 is observed to be decreasing at a rate about 60% slower than
would occur in the absence of emissions, and CFC-12 is still
increasing slightly rather than declining. The emission rates
of these two gases for 2001-2003 were estimated to be about
25-35% of their 1990 emission rates. In contrast, CFC-113 and

Current banked halocarbons will make a substantial contri-

bution to future radiative forcing of climate for many decades
unless a large proportion of these banks is destroyed. Large por-
tions of the global inventories of CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs cur-
rently reside in banks. For example, it is estimated that about
50% of the total global inventory of HFC-134a currently re-
sides in the atmosphere, whereas 50% resides in banks. Figure
2.12 shows the evolution of the GWP-weighted bank size (for
a 100-year time horizon) for halocarbons, based on a top-down
approach using past reported production and detailed com-
parison with atmospheric concentrations (WMO, 2003). This
approach suggests that release of the current banks of CFCs,
HCFCs and HFCs to the atmosphere would correspond conser-
vatively to about 2.8, 3.4 and 1.0 GtCO,-eq, respectively, for
a 100-year time horizon. Although observations of concentra-
tions constrain emissions well, estimates of banks depend on
the cumulative difference between production and emission and
so are subject to larger uncertainties. The bottom-up analysis
by sectors as presented in this report (Chapter 11) suggests pos-
sible banks of CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs of about 15.6, 3.8, and
1.1 GtCO,-eq, for a 100-year time horizon. These approaches
both show that current banks of halocarbons represent a sub-

stantial possible contribution to future radiative forcing.

This section provides a framework for evaluating the im-

cleaning capacity (Section 2.6.2) and on urban and regional air
quality (Section 2.6.3). For the urban and regional scales in par-

tors, including uncertainties in the relative spatial and temporal
distributions of emission of different reactive compounds, non-
linear chemical interactions (especially in polluted regimes),
and complex patterns of atmospheric mixing and transport.
Therefore only the methodology for assessing these impacts is
presented here. Although some numerical examples are provid-

only as an illustration of the methodology required to perform a

As mentioned before, observations of concentrations in the
atmosphere constrain the past emissions, but the banks are the
difference between cumulative emissions and production and
have much larger uncertainties. The values of the emissions and
banks of CFCs and HCFCs used for the Figures 2.11 and 2.12
are based on WMO (2003). Ashford et al. (2004) reported banks
of CFCs and HCFCS that were considerably larger than those
of WMO (2003), especially for CFC-11 and CFC-12. The CFC-
11 bank in 2002 is 0.59 Mt according to WMO (2003) com-
pared with 1.68 Mt according to Ashford et al. (2004); the CFC-
12 bank in 2003 is virtually zero according to WMO (2003)
compared with 0.65 Mt according to Ashford er al. (2004).
The larger banks in Ashford er al. (2004) are accompanied by
significantly lower emissions of CFC-11 and CFC-12 over the
past 10 years, compared with the emissions reported in WMO
(2003). The lower emissions cannot support the observations in
the atmosphere — that is, they lead to global atmospheric con-
centrations about 40 ppt lower than those observed in 2002 for
both CFC-11 and CFC-12.

"The uncertainty in the accumulated top-down emissions is
estimated at about 3%, based on an estimated 2—3% uncertainty
in observed concentrations by different measurement networks
(see Table 2.1). Based on an inverse calculation, the accumu-
lated emissions for 1990-2001 needed to support the observa-
tions of CFC-11 and CFC-12 have an uncertainty of about 4%,
assuming an uncertainty in the observed concentration trends of
1%. The uncertainty in cumulative production is harder to esti-
mate. The total 1990-2001 production of CFC-11 and CFC-12
in Ashford et al. (2004) is about 30-35% lower than in WMO
(2003). This difference can be attributed largely to the neglect
of production data not reported to AFEAS (2004) but which is
included in UNEP production data. See Chapter 11 for a dis-
cussion of uncertainties in bottom-up emission estimates. But
because the additional UNEP production is most likely used
in rapid-release applications (Chapter 11), it does not change
the size of the bank. Uncertainties in accumulated emission and
production add up to the uncertainty in the change in the bank

from 1990 to 2002.

"Some emissions of banked CFCs (such as the slow emissions
of CFC-11 from foams) could occur after ozone recovery. Such
emissions would reduce the effect of the banks on ozone recov-
ery but would still contribute to the positive direct radiative forc-
ing as greenhouse gases. Thus the larger banks of some ODSs
estimated in this report could lead to a maximum delay in ozone
recovery of the order of two to three years compared with the
baseline scenario. If no emissions occurred from the ODS banks
as estimated in WMO (2003, Chapter 1), the date when EESC
is estimated to return to its 1980 value is 2038.9, or an accelera-
tion of about five years. Finally, if emissions of all ODSs were
stopped in 2003, the date when EESC is estimated to return to
its 1980 value was given as 2033.8 in WMO (2003, Chapter 1),
an acceleration of about ten years. Thus, these changes in fu-
ture ODS emissions, within ranges compatible with the present
uncertainties in the banks, have relatively small effects on the
time at which EESC recovers to 1980 levels and therefore on
stratospheric ozone and the indirect radiative forcing of these
gases. The uncertainties in the physical and chemical processes
involved in the time of ozone recovery (as shown in the Figure
in Box 1.7 in Chapter 1) are larger than the uncertainties in the
scenarios associated with these alternative emissions.

Although concentration measurements of many of these com-

they are not sufficiently representative to estimate globally av-

the globally integrated emissions of anthropogenic VOCs with
those of other gases that react with OH, especially CO, CH, and
natural (biogenic) VOCs. This comparison is premised on the
approximation that all emitted VOCs are eventually removed
by reaction with OH, so that the rate of consumption of OH is
related stoichiometrically to the emission rate of any VOC. The

"A direct way to evaluate these impacts is to compare the
consumption rate of OH radicals by halocarbons and their re-
placements with that by the current burden of trace gases such
as CH, and CO. For long-lived species, this comparison is
straightforward because their concentrations are relatively uni-
form on the global scale. Table 2.9 lists the OH consumption
rates for selected long-lived species. The rates are computed
as Komxl XI, where Koux is the rate constant for the reaction
of substance X with OH, and [X] is its observed atmospheric
concentration. For the purpose of obtaining an upper limit,
the rate constants and concentrations are evaluated for surface
conditions (1 atm, 287 K). For the CFCs, halons, HCFCs and
HFCs shown in the table, the OH radical consumption rates
are orders of magnitudes smaller than those of CH, and CO.
Similar estimates for many other CFCs, halons, HCFCs and
HFCs, as well as the PFCs and HFEs, are not possible because
of lack of measurements of their atmospheric concentrations or
of their rate constant for reaction with OH. However, their OH
consumption rates are expected to be small. CFCs, halons and
PFCs are expected to react very slowly with OH because no H
atom is available on these molecules for OH to abstract (see
Section 2.4.1). For HFCs, the known OH reaction rate constants
(0.02-3.2 x 10“ cm? molecule“! s“') are generally smaller than
those of HCFCs (0.02-9.9 x 107? cm? molecule"" s""'), and their
global mean concentrations are expected to be lower than those
of HCFCs because of their shorter emission histories, so that
the OH radical consumption rate of HFCs should be smaller
than that of HCFCs. Thus, the OH radical consumption rates
and consequently the impacts on global air quality of CFCs,
HCFCs, halons, HFCs and PFCs, are not significant compared
to those of CH, and CO.

Table 2.11 presents the MIR scale for conditions appropriate
to North America and the POCP scale for conditions appropri-
ate to Europe for a range of chemical species relevant to this re-
port. MIR values generally fall in the range from 0, unreactive,
to about 15, highly reactive. POCP values cover the range from
0, unreactive, to about 140, highly reactive. In general terms,
the ODSs and HFCs in common use have very low MIR and
POCP values and take no part in ground-level ozone formation.
In contrast, the alkanes (ethane, propane and isobutane) and
alkenes (ethylene and propylene) exhibit steadily increasing re-
activities from ethane, which is unreactive, to propylene, which
is highly reactive. Alkanes have low reactivity on the urban
scale and so have low MIR values. However, alkanes generate
ozone efficiently on the multi-day scale and so appear much
more reactive under European conditions on the POCP scale.

"This simple comparison neglects the nonlinear interactions
that result from chemical and mixing processes involving dif-
ferent air masses, any non-OH removal processes (such as reac-
tions of some VOCs with O,), and the secondary reactions of
OH with intermediates of VOC oxidation. The reactive inter-
mediates may be particularly important for the larger VOCs,
making the comparisons of the relative OH consumption more
conservative on a per-carbon rather than on a per-mole basis,
but many of these intermediates are also believed to be scav-
enged by aerosols (Seinfeld and Pankow, 2003) rather than by
OH. Regeneration of OH — for example, by the photolysis of
H,O, produced during VOC oxidation, or by NO, chemistry — is
not considered, but would, in any case, reduce the impacts. In
view of these uncertainties, the relative reactive-carbon emis-
sions should not be equated to the relative OH consumption
rates, but may be useful in establishing whether incremental
emissions could or could not be significant.

Organic compounds, in the presence of sunlight and NO,, take
part in ground-level ozone formation and thereby contribute to
the deterioration in regional and urban air quality, with adverse
effects on human health and biomes. Each organic compound
exhibits a different propensity to form ozone, which can be
indexed in a reactivity scale. In North America, ground-level
ozone formation is seen as an urban-scale issue and reactiv-
ity scales, such as the Maximum Incremental Reactivity (MIR)
scale, describe the contributions by different organic com-
pounds to the intense photochemical ozone formation in urban
plumes (Carter, 1994). In Europe, ground-level ozone forma-
tion occurs on the regional scale in multi-day episodes, and a
different reactivity scale, the Photochemical Ozone Creation
Potential (POCP), has been developed to address long-range
transboundary formation and transport of ozone. These indices
of reactivity are useful only if fully speciated organic emissions
inventories are known. Such information is frequently available
for European and North American locations, but is not gener-
ally available for cities and Tegions 0 of less 's developed ni nations.

molar substitution of the major CFCs (CFC-11, CFC-12 and
CFC-113) and of CCI, at their maximum emission rates in the

additional national and regional emissions would be negligible

However, larger local impacts could result from highly local-

Gaseous ammonia (NH.) is an important contributor to the
mass of atmospheric aerosols, where it exists primarily as am-
monium sulphate and ammonium nitrate (Seinfeld and Pandis,
1998). Recent evidence also suggests that NH, may promote
the formation of new sulphate particles (Weber et al., 1999).
NH, is removed relatively rapidly (within a few days) from
the atmosphere mostly by dry deposition and rain-out, and to a
lesser extent by gas-phase reaction with OH (see Section 2.4.4).
Incremental emissions of NH, from its use as a replacement for
ODSs must be considered in the context of the uncertain current
local, regional and global NH, emissions.

2.6.2) the global replacement of the major CFCs emissions
at their maximum values in the late 1980s (of about 8 x 10°
mol yr‘) by an equal number of moles of a single compound,
isobutane. The corresponding global isobutane emission incre-
ment is about 460 kt yr"", representing a 3.5% increase over its
current global emissions (see Table 2.10). Regional and local
increments can, however, be substantially larger, depending on
how these emissions are distributed. If additional assumptions
are made that the incremental emissions have no seasonal vari-
ation and are distributed spatially according to population, the
increments would be about 4.6 kt yr for the UK (approximate
population 60 million), 1.5 kt yr! for Mexico City (approxi-
mate population 20 million) and 1.15 kt yr“ for the Los Angeles

kt yr', which is 11% of the current isobutane emissions in the
UK but only 0.6% of the total POCP-weighted VOC emissions
shown in Table 2.12. Similarly, for other European countries the
current and future VOC emissions (see Table 2.15) are much
larger than this hypothetical population-weighted increment
in isobutane emissions. For Mexico City, the MIR-weighted

MIR-weighted isobutane increment would be 1.5 kt yr, which
is 10% of the 1987 isobutane emission but 0.07% of the total
MIR-weighted VOC emissions shown in Table 2.14. Even con-
sidering the substantial reductions in VOC emissions in recent
years (Alexis et al., 2003), it is clear that such isobutane incre-
ments would increase total MIR-weighted VOC emissions by
less than 1%. However, even such small increases in reactivity
may be of some concern in urban areas that currently fail to
meet air quality standards.

A fairly wide range of assessment methods is described so
that the impacts of different technologies on the environment
and climate can be compared and understood. One significant
problem identified is that methodologies like LCA and TEWI
are installation-specific and therefore do not provide meaningful
results for entire sectors. It is also demonstrated that the avail-
able assessment methodologies are not generic but have been
developed for a specific purpose. Each of the methodologies
can play a role in technology choices if used appropriately.

The purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of the
different types of analyses as well as concise guidance on how
to evaluate and apply these. For each type of analysis, the most
important analytical approaches and variables are discussed,
along with the associated sensitivities, uncertainties and limi-
tations. The requirements and limitations of each method are
explained. This provides a point of reference for the selection
of assessment methods in the technical chapters of this report
and gives a framework which helps to harmonize the reporting
of results. Further the chapter provides an introduction to the
technical chapters and to their subsequent application, non-ap-
plication and specific-default macrodata. A description of the
key methods used in these chapters is also given.

"An overview is given of the key approaches used to compare
the lifetime, and the direct and indirect emissions of different
types of systems. These range from the modelling of partial or
complete systems to measured values of individual systems or
of representative equipment populations. There can be signifi-
cant differences between the results from different approaches
and therefore relevant policy comparisons can only be made if
there is maximum transparency and a harmonization of assump-
tions. Reference values for emissions from energy consumption
in the production of fluids and products are given along with
values for CO, emissions from electricity generation for the
national electricity grids. These values differ significantly over
time and between regions, suggesting that great care should be

"ic and social impacts of the policies and the resulting impact
on greenhouse-gas emissions. At the project level, the simplest
cost assessment using cost-benefit analysis considers that a new
technology requires capital investment to cover costs accounted
in the project. Major categories of costs accounted in a project
are labour, land, material, energy, investments, environmental
services and foreign exchange. These costs are known as the
direct engineering and financial costs. A more complete cost
evaluation requires the inclusion of externalities, the costs not
paid directly by the private commercial entity developing the
project. External costs are paid by society and where available,
these should be considered for wider policy assessments. In
principle, the total cost to society (social cost) consists of both
the external cost and the private cost. For the assessment of en-
gineering-type measures relevant to this report, the focus is best
placed on private costs, expressed in terms of their net present
value (NPV) or as levelized costs to account for the time distri-
bution of costs and investments during the project lifetime.

"The phase out of CFCs and HCFCs under the Montreal Protocol
requires the selection of replacement technologies, and in many
cases are these alternative fluids. These technologies have dif-
fering impacts on global climate change, health, safety and
other environmental endpoints, and different private and so-
cial costs. Analyses that focus on one or more of these types
of impacts can help decision-makers to make choices about
competing replacement technologies. However the outcomes
of such analyses are influenced by many factors not intrinsic
to the technologies. Examples of these are the analytical ap-
proach (e.g., top-down compared with bottom-up), the degree
of product or process optimization, service and disposal prac-
tices, regional circumstances and a wealth of other inputs and
assumptions. Therefore in order to make informed choices, de-
cision-makers need to be aware of the sensitivities, uncertain-
ties and limitations inherent in each type of analysis, and must
be able to evaluate whether the approach and assumptions used
in an analysis are reasonable for the regions and time periods in
which the competing technologies are to be applied.

Health and safety issues are an integral aspect of decisions
concerning the choice of fluids. These decisions can have far-
reaching consequences for the workforce, the population, in-
dustry, the environment and the economy. The prevention of
negative health and safety impacts requires methodologies such
as risk assessment, risk management, and policy and regula-
tory controls. Health and safety issues are considered under the
following criteria: Flammability, acute toxicity, chronic toxic-
ity, carcinogenicity, acute ecotoxicity, chronic ecotoxicity, and
persistence. Information on the substances covered by this re-
port was drawn from several sources. The technical chapters
provide detailed information on the substances and the prod-
ucts these are used in is provided in the subsequent technical
chapters. The information is divided into general characteristics
of a group of fluids followed by typical characteristics of cer-
tain fluids within the group. There are significant differences
between the various fluid groups, and in some cases within the
fluid groups, with respect to flammability, acute toxicity, eco-
toxicity and persistence. The design of systems and processes
should reflect the specific weaknesses of the fluids used.

For applications involving banked amounts of fluids, an
overview is given of the available approaches and associated
uncertainties for the modelling of process emissions compared
to emissions in the usage phase and upon disposal. For both
areas, the future usage pattern and emissions can be estimated
using bottom-up and top-down approaches. The former ideally
involves the modelling of the emissions of individual substanc-
es or substance classes from populations of equipment. The
properties of these pieces of equipment will often be modelled
differently for different years and in different regions so as to
reflect anticipated technological changes. In contrast to these
technology-rich approaches, top-down models rely on histori-
cally established relations between sales into certain sectors
and economic growth. This approach is typically weakest in
capturing long-term technological changes but is good for the
appropriate capture of mid- to long-term growth and wealth ef-

In the past, too little attention was paid to ensuring the com-
parability and transferability of results from different technol-
ogy assessments. The treatment of uncertainties is often incom-
plete and therefore the resulting recommendations are often not
robust enough to be transferred across a sector. To address these
concerns, analysts and decision-makers should ensure, wherev-
er possible, that the assumptions and methods used to compare
competing technologies are consistent and that uncertainties and
sensitivities are identified and quantified. The development of
simple and pragmatic standard methodologies and the respec-
tive quality criteria should be continued. It is recommended that
future efforts should focus on increasing the involvement of rel-
evant stakeholders and introducing additional measures to in-
crease transparency for outside users, for example by providing
more extensive documentation. For certain regions and policy
questions the amount of resources needed for some of the as-
sessment methods is prohibitive. There is a need for simple and
pragmatic assessment methods that can also be used in regions
with very limited resources.

Fluorinated substances such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)
and perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are being widely used or are be-
ing considered for future use as refrigerants, blowing agents
in foam production, propellants for aerosol applications, sol-
vents, surfactants, fire-fighting agents and anaesthetics. These
substances are used in many technical applications over a wide
range of conditions. They are replacing the use of CFCs and
HCFCs, which were and are being banned due to their signifi-

As a result of international concerted action, many of the
sectors and applications covered in this report have undergone
a rapid transition away from the use of ODSs. This mandated
transition has also led to a significant increase in knowledge
about technological alternatives to the use of ODSs and has re-
sulted in increased innovation. This high rate of innovation has
made it more difficult to appropriately characterize technology
options and then to assess them in terms of their performance
or costs. Therefore it is now more important than ever to ap-
ply consistent methodologies, as outlined in this chapter, for
the purpose of producing valid comparisons upon which robust
technology choices can be based.

"This chapter provides public and corporate decision-makers
with an overview of assessment methodologies that can be used
to support informed decisions on technologies to replace the
use of ozone-depleting substances (ODSs). Such decisions are
taken in the context of the phase out of ozone-depleting sub-
stances under the Montreal Protocol, and national and interna-
tional policies aimed at reducing emissions of anthropogenic
greenhouse gases. The latter include not only direct emissions
of fluids during production, use and disposal but also energy-
related emissions over the lifetime of products and equipment.
Decisions on technology choices and the definition of appro-
priate practices will often take place at the level of individual
projects but could also be important in designing policies. This
chapter has therefore been designed as a toolbox for decision-
makers. The intention is to give an overview of the most com-

their practical limitations. It also provides information used by

"This section considers aspects related to emissions from prod-
ucts and equipment using HFCs or PFCs. Direct and indirect
emissions need to be identified to account for the full inven-
tory of such emissions. Indirect emissions are usually associ-
ated with the amount of energy consumed for the operation of
equipment loaded with the fluid. Table 3.1 gives an overview
of the relative contribution of direct HFC emissions to the total
greenhouse-gas emissions associated with systems, for exam-
ple, a domestic refrigerator, a refrigerated truck, a supermarket
cooling system or the energy losses through an insulated area
of building surface. The table shows that for several important
technical systems (e.g. mobile air conditioners or supermarket
refrigeration) direct and indirect emissions are of the same or-
der of magnitude but that for several other applications, energy-
related indirect emissions outweigh direct emissions by one or
two orders of magnitude. The methodologies stated in Table 3.1
are described in greater detail in Section 3.5. Specific values are
highly dependent on emission factors, end-of-life treatment of
equipment, the GWP of the fluids used and the carbon intensity
of the energy supply system.

HFCs and alternative fluids are generally used in the manufacture
of refrigeration systems, foams, aerosols and fire protection
equipment, whereas solvent applications (e.g. cleaning) tend
to apply fluids directly on-site during the in-use stage. The
manufacture of refrigeration products requires transfer of
the fluid. Losses normally occur due to the connection and
disconnection of hoses and valves. Emissions also originate
from storage vessels and the associated piping, but these are
less frequent.

Some sources of emissions are specific to certain applications
and products. For example, refrigerants are often used to rinse
out air, moisture and other contaminants from refrigeration
equipment to ensure internal cleanliness prior to charging.
Moreover, the refrigerant may also be employed as a tracer
for the detection of leaks. Equipment leaks may be found after
charging of the refrigerant, in which case further emissions
will occur during the recovery and evacuation process prior to
repairing the leaks. During the manufacture of foams, fluids are
used as blowing agents. The blowing-agent emissions during
the preparation of foam formulations, when the blowing agent
is mixed with other raw materials such as polyols, are low due
to the use of closed systems. Depending on the type of foam

Once manufactured, fluids can be shipped nationally or
internationally, often as bulk shipment or in individual cylinders.
Typically, national or regionally organized distribution chains
deliver bulk quantities to product manufacturers or transfer the
substances into smaller containers for use by manufacturers
and service companies, in the case of refrigerants and solvents.
The distribution chain stops when the substance enters into the
management or control of the ‘user’, such as a manufacturer or
a service company. Losses normally occur during the transfer
of fluids, connection and disconnection of hoses, and leakage
from containers and pressure relief devices. These losses tend
to be relatively small in relation to the large quantities of
materials handled (Banks er al., 1998), as transfer operations
take place under carefully-controlled conditions and are subject
to international regulations for the prevention of releases (e.g.
UN, 2002; IMO, 2000).

The manufacture of fluids requires feedstock materials,
which are sourced, produced and used worldwide. Emissions
from these feedstock materials, their intermediates and the
end substance can occur in chemical processing plants. For
the production of many HFCs, these direct emissions can be
significant in terms of CO, equivalent (on a GWP(100) basis
— see Section 3.5.1). For example, the substances emitted
during the production of HFC-227ea were estimated to amount
to 120 kg CO,-eq kg"" of material manufactured (Banks et al.,
1998), whereas for HFC-134a this figure was relatively low
with estimates ranging from 2—40 kg CO,-eq kg!. (McCulloch
and Lindley, 2003 and Banks and Sharratt, 1996, respectively).
These values are strongly dependent on the fluid manufacturing
process and the integrity of the chemical plant. The good
design and operation of the plant can lead to lower emissions. It
should be noted that some of the intermediate substances might
be ODSs (although these are converted into the end product
without being emitted). For example CFC-114a, HCFC-133
and HFCF-124 are used in particular routes for the manufacture
of HFC-134a (Frischknecht, 1999). The emissions of GHGs are
significantly less for alternative fluids. HC-290, HC-600a and
HC-1270 are generally extracted from natural gas mixtures and

"tic, commercial and industrial refrigerating equipment gener-
ally originate from failures in system components or from
the handling of refrigerant during servicing, with the size and
frequency of leaks depending upon several factors. External
factors include usage patterns, frequency of equipment reloca-
tion, weathering and aggressive environments, repair quality
and frequency of preventative maintenance. Rapid fluctuations
of temperature or pressure and excessive vibration of piping,
joints and so forth, due to fan motors and compressors or other
external sources are major causes of in-use leakage. Other in-
tegral aspects are associated with the design and construction
of the equipment. The design quality of the equipment and the
use of suitable components have a significant impact on leak-
age rates. Control systems are also responsible for emissions,
such as pressure-relief devices. Most industry guidance on
emissions focuses on leak prevention for the in-use stage (e.g.,
see Institute of Refrigeration, 1995; Butler, 1994; ETSU, 1997).

Annual emissions from foams are generally minor during
the in-use stage. The blowing agent in closed cell foams is
released over time and typically only part of the blowing agent/
insulant will be released during the useful life of the product.
Caleb (2000) has calculated emission factors for different
rigid foams based on a survey and the collection of data from
emission factors reported in the literature. Lee and Mutton
(2004) recently did the same for extruded polystyrene or XPS

Fluids may be vented or recovered during the decommissioning
of refrigeration equipment, unexpelled fire protection systems
and equipment using solvents. Over the past decade the price
of recovery equipment has fallen significantly and the sales of
such equipment have expanded, indicating that recovery has
become much more widespread than was the case during the
1980s and first half of the 1990s. Blowing agents from foams
and propellant from aerosols can also be recovered at end-of-
life, but current methods have a low effectiveness. Emission
levels of refrigeration and air-conditioning systems, and of
foam applications are very sensitive to disposal practices.

For refrigerants, fluids from fire protection systems and

at end-of-life are the same as those associated with normal
handling, as discussed previously for the servicing aspect during
the in-use stage. Fluids used to be vented when equipment was
decommissioned but where legislation has been introduced, the
expected practice is to recover the fluid. If the fluid is recovered,
it may be re-used (in its recovered form), recycled (using on-site
machinery) or taken back to the supplier or recycling centre for
cleaning (and re-use) or disposal. Uncontaminated fluids can
normally be reused and whether a fluid can be cleaned on-site

Decision-makers should realise that, in general, a leakage
rate is not necessarily intrinsic to a certain technology but
can also strongly depend on a number of environmental and
operational factors. If properly understood, these factors can be
systematically influenced to reduce emission levels. Whilst the
quality of maintenance and repairs to equipment influence the
leakage during operation, the actual handling of refrigerant may
also lead to significant emissions, for example the removal of
fluid from a system and the subsequent recharge. The degree of
leakage is strongly dependent on the behaviour of the personnel
and the tools they use, and will range from the minimum (that
associated with residual gas within hoses and the system) up to
quantities exceeding the system charge. Despite the legislation
against venting in a number of countries, practices frequently
prevail in which the whole system is vented, leak-tested with
the fluid (possibly several times until all leaks are repaired) and
flushed with the fluid before final recharging. Poorly connected
hoses and fittings, and poor-quality recovery equipment can
significantly contribute to high emissions.

"ity of the equipment. Emissions from aerosols are simply a
function of the amount of propellant used. Fire protection sys-
tems produce emissions upon demand, as is the intention, al-
though undesired emissions occur from false alarms or faulty
signals, or from mandatory system qualification tests that re-
quire full system discharge. Sometimes training also involves
the operation of the fire protection system. Within the use
phase of certain applications, such as fire protection systems,
equipment servicing and maintenance may require the removal
of fluid from a system and subsequent recharge, and emissions
associated with this. Fire protection systems also exhibit slow
passive emissions throughout the in-use stage, particularly in
the case of high-pressure cylinder systems. Similarly systems
that are being maintained can produce significant emissions
if the system is accidentally initiated, or when servicing of
the systems requires checking and confirmation of operation.
Processes that use solvents generally lead to emissions as a
result of residual fluid evaporation of treated items, and to a
lesser extent whenever equipment is opened as part of its use.

and hosing are used. Emissions are minimized by selecting the
correct materials for the fluids used. In making this choice, the
influence of other fluids within the mixture such as refrigera-
tion oils and aerosol fragrances, which can affect permeability,
should also be considered. In rigid insulating foams, the passive
emission of blowing agents occurs through diffusion. The dif-
fusion coefficients of HFCs through the rigid insulating foams
vary considerably, dependent on the type of blowing agent.
The use of non-permeable facer materials such as aluminium
foils and metal skins can significantly reduce the diffusion of
blowing agents. Passive emissions typically occur throughout
all stages of the fluid and foam life, but as they are relatively
constant, they predominate during the in-use stage.

Quantifying emissions from a specific application is useful for
several purposes, including the retrospective environmental
impact assessment or the evaluation of operating costs.

 
"	Text
" 

Functional emissions occur specifically with fire protection,
aerosols and some solvent uses. In situations where the fluid
is within storage facilities, or within pressure systems during
the in-use stage, intentional releases can occur in response to
uncontrolled circumstances, for example, when pressure relief
devices vent in the event of fire. Similarly, fire protection sys-
tems may release fluid in response to false signals from heat,
smoke or light detectors, thus discharging the whole system.
"	Text
"Intentional releases are determined by human activity and
may be unnecessary or required because of the function of
the application (e.g. aerosols, fire protection). Unnecessary
intentional releases occur where the operator chooses to directly
release the fluid to the atmosphere. Examples include venting
where the fluid is not recovered following removal from an
application, the fluid being released directly through opening
valves or cutting into pipe work, or the operator employing the
fluid for ulterior uses such as blowing dust from pipes, and so
forth.

Handling emissions are unintentional releases that occur

with human intervention, for example, where a fluid is being
transferred into or out of equipment and complete recovery
is impractical. Residual amounts of fluid occur in transfer
hoses, within components and systems following recovery,
and absorbed in certain materials such as oil. The fluid will
subsequently migrate to the atmosphere when hoses are
disconnected or systems are opened following recovery. Such
releases occur throughout the life of the fluid regardless of the
application, but a lack of training and insufficient awareness
of the environmental impact of fluids means that personnel are
less likely to mitigate emissions when handling them.

"Unfortunately for most applications it is difficult to measure the
field leakage and even where this is possible, the measurement
is imprecise. Laboratory studies are largely impractical for
most applications, for example large supermarket refrigeration
systems that are built and maintained by a number of different
companies. However, emissions from foams are usually less
sensitive to external conditions and so laboratory measurements
are normally highly appropriate. Releases during fluid
manufacture, fluid distribution and the manufacture/distribution
of equipment would normally be measured by monitoring the
mass flow of material into and out of facilities. The same applies
at end-of-life, when recovered fluid is returned to suppliers and
delivered to recycling or incineration facilities.

Ruptures are accidental breaks in pressure systems, such
as fractures in pipework, vessels and components. These
are normally associated with fluids under high pressure and
therefore tend to occur throughout most stages of the fluid life.
Ruptures can result from external forces applied to components,
inherent material weaknesses, the influence of pressure and
temperature changes, vibration, the ageing of materials and
corrosion. Large ruptures are generally the most notable type of
leaks and tend to cause rapid and often complete release of the
fluid. Rupture leaks or emissions do not apply to foam because
the pressure differential within and outside the foams is very
small. Ruptures can be minimized by appropriately designing
piping and components to account for anticipated stresses,
protecting against external impact and avoiding a chemically
aggressive environment.
"	Text

Different approaches can be used to 10 prediction ¢ emissions
associated with particular equipment or systems. The least
accurate but most simplistic approach is to apply annual leak
rates (% yr') for the appropriate sector or equipment types to the
mass of fluid used. However, these are generally approximated
using bottom-up methods, combined with limited measured
data and industry interviews (e.g. March, 1996). At best, leak
rates may be found for equipment manufacture, aggregate in-
use stage and end-of-life recovery. More detailed analyses
may be conducted by calculating releases from each element
throughout the equipment life. This also depends on good
information about the flow of material throughout its life, data
on component dimensions and knowledge about the behaviour
of technician handling (US EPA, 1995). For example, Colbourne
and Suen (1999) provide empirically-derived emission indexes
for the leakage of different components and different servicing
frequencies in order to estimate leakage for a whole system.
With this more detailed approach, the actual design of systems
and equipment can be more accurately assessed and ‘emission
optimization’ can be applied to the design and operation.

Since releases at the in-use stage tend to predominate, these

are more frequently monitored. The problem with existing
methods such as gas detection is that they do not measure the
mass of fluid released; concentrations of leaked gas detected
indicate the presence of a leak, but do not permit this to be
quantified (Van Gerwen and Van der Wekken, 1995). Recent
developments in leak detection for refrigerating systems include
intrinsic detectors, where a reduction in refrigerant inventory
is measured within the system (as opposed to measuring the
presence of refrigerant outside it) (Peall, 2003, www.nesta.org.
uk/ourawaardees/profiles/3763/index.html). Such an approach is
particularly useful for accurately measuring the loss of charge but
does not provide information on losses from handling activities.
The most accurate method is to record the mass usage of the
substance. For refrigerating equipment, fire protection systems
and solvent use, this involves tracking the quantities of chemi-
cals that are acquired, distributed and used to fill a net increase
in the total mass (charge) of the equipment. Quantities not ac-
counted for are assumed to have been emitted. Entities that con-
tract equipment maintenance to service companies can estimate
their emissions by requesting the service company to track the
quantities of refrigerant recovered from and added to systems.

must be exercised when using these measurements to estimate
in-use emissions. Although the emission of the blowing agent

The IPCC Good Practice Guidance on National Greenhouse
Gas Inventories published in 2000 (IPCC, 2000a) includes
three methods for estimating emissions of ODS substitutes. The
tier 1 method that equates emissions to consumption (potential
emissions), the tier 2a bottom-up method that applies country-
specific emission factors to estimates of equipment stock at dif-
ferent life-cycle stages, and the tier 2b top-down method that
uses a country-level, mass-balance approach. For sectors where
the chemical is banked into equipment, the tier 1 method is sig-
nificantly less accurate than the other two approaches. This is
particularly the case where the equipment bank is being built
up and this is precisely the current situation for air conditioning
and refrigeration equipment during the transition from CFCs
and HCFCs to HFCs. In this situation, most of the chemical
consumed is used to fill new equipment volume (charge) rath-
er than to replace emitted gas, and therefore the tier 1 method
greatly overestimates emissions. To a lesser extent, the tier 2b
country-level, mass-balance approach is also inaccurate dur-
ing the period of bank building, but in this case, the error is
an underestimate (see the discussion in Section 3.2.1.3 for an
explanation of this underestimate). That is why the IPCC rec-
ommends supplementing the tier 2b approach with the tier 2a
emission-factor based approach. The disadvantage of the tier
2a approach is that for the first few years of equipment life, the
emission factors will necessarily be based on engineering esti-
mates rather than empirical experience. However, when the first
cohort of equipment is serviced, the emission factors can be
corrected as necessary. Ultimately, when the HFC-using equip-
ment starts to be retired, the tier 2b method can be used on its
own with a high level of accuracy.

A key question in cost analysis is whether all relevant di-
mensions (e.g. technical, environmental, social) can be mea-
sured in the same units as the costs (i.e. monetary). It is gen-
erally accepted that some impacts, such as avoided climate
change, cannot be fully represented by monetary estimates and
it is imperative that the cost methodology is supplemented by a
broader assessment of impacts measured in quantitative and if

There are two approaches to discounting (IPCC, 1996b). One
approach (known as ethical) gives special attention to the wealth
of future generations and uses a social discounting rate. Another
approach (known as descriptive) is based on the discount rates
savers and investors actually apply on their day-to-day deci-
sions and uses a higher, private cost discount rate. The former
leads to relatively low rates of discount (around 2-3% in real
terms) and the latter to relatively higher rates (at least 6% and in
some case very much higher rates) (IPCC, 2001b, pp. 466).

In any economic analysis of climate change mitigation,
the cost of mitigation is calculated as a difference in costs and
benefits between a baseline case and a policy case that implies
lower emissions. Where possible, the definitions of the base-
line and policy cases should include all major social, economic
and environmental impacts (at minimum from GHG emissions
and ODP emissions). In other words, the system boundary of
the cost analysis should facilitate the inclusion of all major im-
pacts. The system boundary can be a specific project, one or
more sectors, or the entire economy.

be considered small enough to exclude significant sectoral and
economy-wide impacts; b) the basis for conducting a sectoral
level cost analysis is weak since the literature does not include
sectoral modelling studies for activities which involve the pro-
duction and use of ODSs and their substitutes; c) and finally
the current section is a first attempt to define consistent cost
concepts applied to the assessment of climate change and ODS
mitigation policies.

Policy implementation can require upfront capital costs and
changes (decreases or increases) in operation and maintenance
costs compared with the baseline case over the lifetime of the
project. Major categories of costs accounted in a financial cost
assessment are capital, labour, land, materials, maintenance
and administrative costs. The various costing elements need to
be transformed into values that are comparable over the time
frame and as such the cost assessment depends on assumptions
about discount rates. The time dimension of costs can be dealt
with using various policy evaluation approaches and an over-
view of some of those applied to the cost-effectiveness analysis

At the same time, it should also be recognized that social
and economic time scales are not fixed. They are sensitive to so-

as the choices made by individuals and institutions. In some
cases behavioural and technological changes have occurred
rapidly under severe economic conditions, for example during
the oil crises of the 1970s (IPCC, 2001a, pp. 93). Apparently,

scenarios about future GHG emissions from a sector. These les-

looking solely for least-cost policies given current preferences

that are economically and environmentally suboptimal, because
the existing infrastructure makes it difficult to introduce alter-

In all work on costs, a basic distinction can be drawn between
the social cost of any activity and the financial cost. Social cost
is the full value of the scarce resources used in the activity mea-
sured from the point of view of society. Financial cost measures
the costs from the perspective of a private company or an indi-
vidual and bases its values on the costs that actually face these
agents. A difference between social and financial costs arises
when private agents do not take full account of the costs that
they impose on other agents through their activities — such a
cost is termed an external cost. Positive impacts which are not
accounted for in the actions of the agent responsible, are re-
ferred to as external benefits.

link between the person who creates the ‘externality’ and the per-

for the relevant resources are not well defined. Externalities do
not necessarily arise when there are effects on third parties. In
some cases, these effects may already be recognized, or ‘inter-
nalized’ and included in the price of goods and services. Figure
3.4 illustrates different subcategories of environmental costs,

to delays in permitting, and so forth, and due to disputation
with regulators and others). The box labelled societal includes
environmental costs that are external to a company. These are

Furthermore, it should be realized that as industrial com-

become interested in using the most advanced production para-
digms. For example, this was the case for lean production, an
approach which evolved in Japan during the post-war period
and implied greater flexibility in production and working part-

In addition to the above, the costs of implementation deserve
special attention. Many aspects of implementation are not fully
covered in conventional cost analyses (see Table 3.7). A lot of
work needs to be done to quantify the institutional and other
costs of programmes, so that the reported cost figures repre-
sent the full costs of policy implementation. As shown in Table
3.7, implementation costs depend on institutional and human
capacities, information requirements, market size and the learn-

form of taxes and subsidies.

Equity considerations are concerned with the issues of how the

concerns can be integrated in cost analysis by reporting the dis-
tribution of costs and benefits to individuals and society as a
supplement to total cost estimates. Some authors also suggest
applying income distribution weightings to the costs and ben-
efits to reflect the prosperity of beneficiaries and losers (Ray,
1984; Banuri et al., 1996).

Uncertainties in cost estimates are related to both private
and external cost components. Private cost figures tend to be
less uncertain than external cost components, since the private
costs primarily relate to market-based economic transactions.
However, there is a particular uncertainty related to projections
of future efficiency, and the costs and penetration rates of new
technologies. One way to handle this uncertainty is to under-
take a sensitivity analysis based on scenarios for high, low and
medium case values (Markandya and Halsnes, 2000). Another
way of accounting is to consider some kind of ‘learning curve’,
that is an expected cost reduction as a function of the increasing
amount of products using the technology.

"For most of the mitigation measures discussed in this Special
Report, the specific measures (e.g. technical facilities, infra-
structure, demand-side regulation, supply-side regulation, in-
formation efforts, technical standards) can be considered to
have relatively small economic impacts outside of a narrow
project border and can therefore be regarded as ‘stand-alone’
investments that are assessed using a project assessment ap-
proach. However, this does not imply that the cost assessment
should solely limit itself to a consideration of the financial cost
elements. A project system boundary allows a fairly detailed
assessment of GHG emissions and the economic and social
impacts generated by a specific project or policy. Accordingly
various direct and indirect social costs and benefits of the GHG
reduction policies under consideration should be included in the
analysis.

This new integrated management approach is illustrated in
Figure 3.5. The figure shows a typical production chain, where
the dotted line represents the boundary within the production
process. Within that boundary, the management of the process
may be integrated, irrespective of the number of companies in-
volved or their exact legal relationship. This boundary might
also include the extraction of raw materials, various product
end-uses and even the disposal of the materials after use.

Every stage of production ‘and consumption implies im-
portant environmental impacts. Companies are increasingly
being required to explicitly manage these environmental im-
pacts in response to formal regulations and pollution charges.
Alternatively they might voluntarily adopt cleaner production
technologies and tools, such as eco-auditing, in response to in-
creasing expectations from society. Another driving force can
be the increasing legislative liabilities of companies with re-
spect to pollution. It is therefore useful for analysts to consider
a system-wide company boundary that includes all stages of
production in life cycle assessment, as shown in Figure 3.5.

Companies set boundaries around the activities they man-
age directly as well as those they do not control or manage. A
distinctive feature of the lean production system has been an
increasing transparency across firms that are dealing with dif-
ferent elements of the production chain. There has also been a
tendency towards integrating management functions along the
supply chain in order to examine the entire production chain for
added value sources, irrespective of the current legal company
boundaries along the chain. The application of information
technology to business processes has facilitated the introduc-
tion of these new management systems. Without this the appli-
cation of quantitative methods would have proved too complex
(Wallace, 1996).

"Chemical exposure can cause or contribute to many serious
health effects such as heart ailments, damage to the central
nervous system, kidney and lungs, sterility, cancer, burns and
rashes (US DoL, 1998). The impact of these effects includes
lower productivity, absenteeism, increased health-care costs,
litigation, and economic downturn at both the enterprise and
national levels. Most countries have passed occupational health
and safety laws in response to this, but the enforcement of such
legislation is difficult, particularly in developing countries. This
is borne out by the fact that only 5-10 % of workers in de-
veloping countries and 20-50 % of workers in industrialized
countries (with a few exceptions) are estimated to have access

"Health and safety issues are an integral aspect of deciding the

all focus on minimizing negative health and safety impacts, and
then consider risk management, policy and regulatory controls.
This approach should be used for each step of the life cycle
of the product including production, distribution, use, main-

an increase in one life-cycle stage so as to arrive at an overall
improvement in the impact accumulated over the life cycle.

"Risk management is a broad term for the process that uses the
outcomes of a scientific risk assessment to implement best prac-
tices, which are usually supported by appropriate policy and
regulatory frameworks. A number of options are usually avail-

and the technological, economic and policy options available to
address this. Effective risk management includes a wide range
of measures such as information provision, training and/or re-
training, risk assessment training, redesignated work practices,
use of personal protective equipment, evaluation and monitor-
ing of both the immediate and wider environments, redefinition
of exposure limits and standards, and medical examinations.

Risk assessment is central to safety. It provides the scientifically
sound basis for actions, including policy and regulatory actions
to manage potential risks from the production, storage, trans-
portation, use and disposal of chemicals. A number of param-
eters must be considered when undertaking risk assessments,
such as chemical composition, stability and reactivity, hazards
identification and classification, transportation, storage and
handling, ecological impacts, physical and chemical properties,
routes of exposure, effects of exposure, exposure limits, and
toxicological information. As well as guiding the decision on
the choice of a chemical to be used for a particular application,
the assessment will also inform decisions on risk management
as well as policy and regulatory controls.

reasonableness, and these need to be adjusted when new pro-

that have health and safety implications not covered under the

that an appropriate regulatory and policy framework exists to

"Climate Change The radiative effects of CFCs and their al-
ternatives on climate is discussed in detail in Chapter 2 and, for
the purposes of comparisons between climate impacts, the most
important parameter is global-warming potential. This is a con-
version factor that relates the climatic impact from an emission
of particular greenhouse gas to that of an equivalent amount
of emissions of carbon dioxide. It is calculated by integrating
the radiative forcing from an emission of one kilogram of the
greenhouse gas over a fixed time period (the integration time
horizon, ITH) and comparing it to the same integral for a kilo-
gram of carbon dioxide; units are (kg CO, equivalent)(kg emis-
sion)'. Commonly quoted integration time horizons are 20,
100 and 500 years with impacts beyond each ITH being ig-
nored (see Table 2.1). The calculation has to be performed in
this way because the reference gas, carbon dioxide, has a very
long environmental lifetime; for example its impact up to 20
years is only 9% of that up to 500 years (IPCC, 1996a). The
standard values for the emissions accounting required by the
Kyoto Protocol are those in the Second Assessment Report of
the IPCC (IPCC, 1996a) at the 100-year time horizon. The 20-
year time scale does not meet the time criterion for judging sus-
tainability; focusing on 20 years would ignore most of the effect
on future generations (WCED, 1987). GWPs from the Second
Assessment Report at the 100-year time horizon represent the
standard for judging national performance. For the purpose
of system comparisons the most recent IPCC GWPs could be
used, for example, as presented earlier in this report. However,
it should be noted that GWPs are parameters constructed to en-
able the ranking of emissions of greenhouse gases and do not
reflect absolute environmental impact in the same way as, for
example, the calculated future radiative forcing described in
Chapter 2.

those associated with disposal of the fluid at the system’s end

Arguably the largest environmental impact from many refriger-

consumption and emissions during their operation. Similarly,
the energy saved by thermal insulating foam is the principal
offset for any effect due to fluid emissions. In order to help
quantify these effects, TEWI sets out to standardize the calcula-

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is clearly the most compre-
hensive and formal approach to assessing and comparing the
environmental impacts of technologies. The methodology for
LCAs has been developed and formalized in the ISO 14040 se-
ries of international standards. On the other hand, TEWI (Total
Equivalent Warming Impact) has the most limited scope, but
has been applied most widely for the technologies within the
remit of this report. It addresses the climatic impact of equip-
ment operation and the disposal of operating fluids at end-of-
life but, although it may be appropriate for most of the common
systems, it does not consider the energy embodied in the fluid
or equipment. This energy may be important in some cases and
this consideration has led to the concept of LCCP (Life Cycle
Climate Performance).

one system using one methodology (i.e. set of assumptions,
equations, procedures and source data) is not comparable with a
TEWI value calculated for another system using another meth-
odology. Then a comparison of TEWI is meaningless.

The next level of complexity goes beyond the use of generic
data. It requires real emission patterns obtained from field trials
and operating experience and, preferably, the range of values ob-
tained from such studies should be indicated and used in a sensi-
tivity analysis (Fischer et al., 1994; ADL, 1994 and 2002; Sand
et al., 1997; IPCC/TEAP, 1999). As the disposal of the fluid can
have a significant impact, it is important to incorporate the real
emissions on disposal. If the systems under consideration do not
yet exist, the methods for calculating emissions patterns should
have been verified against real operating systems.

application of TEWL. At the simplest level, a default emission
function could be used for the fluid release together with calcu-

to calculate global emissions from refrigeration and closed-cell

some cases after many years service) and this can have a pro-

performed using the most recent GWP values published by the

that the results are as portable as possible and to facilitate inter-

most probable that the effect of the new system on the energy balance would be,
at least in part, to replace demand from elsewhere. And even if demand is ad-

A standard method of calculation which includes the con-
cepts and arithmetic described here has been developed for
refrigeration and air-conditioning systems, and the principles
of this may be applied to other systems (BRA, 1996, consis-
tent with EN378, 2000). TEWI can also be used to optimize
the climate performance of existing installations and methods
of working (McCulloch, 1995a; DETR, 1999). A particularly
valuable application is in the construction or refurbishment of
buildings, where TEWI can be used to facilitate the choice be-
tween different forms of insulation, heating and cooling. The
affect of the design on both the TEWI and cost can be investi-
gated, and significant greenhouse-gas emissions abated (DETR,
1999). The interaction between TEWI and cost is particularly
useful when additional equipment is required to achieve an ac-
ceptable level of protection. For example, the cost of that safety
equipment could have been invested in efficiency improve-
ments (ADL, 2002; Hwang et al., 2004).

A comprehensive study has been made of representative
LCCPs for alternative technologies in the areas of domestic re-
frigeration, automobile air conditioning, unitary air condition-
ing, large chillers, commercial refrigeration, foam building in-
sulation, solvents, aerosols (including medical aerosols) and fire
protection (ADL, 2002). The results were very similar to those
of the TEWI analyses (see particularly Sand et al. (1997)). For
example, the LCCP of domestic refrigerators was dominated by
their energy use and there was no clear difference between the
refrigerant fluids or blowing agents used in insulating foams.
However the end-of-life disposal method has a significant im-
pact on the LCCP (Johnson, 2003). As long as the disposal of all
of the systems was treated in the same way, automobile air con-
ditioning was most heavily influenced by the conditions under
which it was operated (the climatic and social conditions of dif-
ferent geographical areas). Thus the highest LCCP values arose
for vehicles in the southern USA, and this value was higher still
if the fluid chosen did not allow for efficient operation (ADL,
2002).

A relatively straightforward application for TEWI and

the difference between LCCP and TEWI is that the GWP of
each greenhouse-gas component is augmented by the embodied

effect of these is now generally quite small as in much of the
world the practice is to minimize or destroy process emissions
(compare Section 3.2.1. 1).

LCA is a technique for assessing the environmental aspects
of a means of accomplishing a function required by society (a
‘product or service system’ in LCA terminology) and their im-
pacts. A life cycle assessment involves compiling an inventory
of relevant inputs and outputs of the system itself and of the sys-
tems that are involved in those inputs and outputs (Life Cycle
Inventory Analysis). The potential environmental impacts of
these inputs and outputs are then evaluated. At each stage it is
important to interpret the results in relation to the objectives of
the assessment (ISO, 1997). Only an assessment which covers
the full life cycle of the product system can be described as
an ‘LCA’. The methodology is also applicable to other forms
of assessment, such as TEWI described above, provided that
the scope of the assessment and its result are clearly defined.
So whereas LCA studies describe the environmental impacts of
product systems from raw material acquisition to final disposal,

clearly defined. This should include the application, reasons for
the study and the intended recipients of the results. To meet this
objective, the scope of the study needs to specify the perfor-
mance characteristics of the product and to define a ‘functional

are a large number of variables with varying degrees of au-

not exist. However, it should be possible to perform sensitiv-
ity analyses with comparatively little effort so as to provide a
commentary on the significance of the impacts determined in
the assessment (Ross et al., 2002). The requirements for data
quality assessment are described in ISO (1997, 1998, 20000).

Once a functional unit that is practical and meets the needs
of those commissioning the assessment has been defined, a
reference flow can be established from which all of the ancil-
lary inputs and outputs may be calculated. For example, in a
cold store this could be the annual throughput of foodstuff from
which the number of receipts and deliveries, the energy load,
and so forth can be estimated. In any LCA it is essential that the
system boundaries are clearly and unambiguously defined. This
includes not only the boundaries of the primary physical system
under assessment (in this example the cold store) but also the
extent to which inputs and outputs will be traced back to ele-
mentary flows (material drawn from or placed into the environ-
ment). The documentation for the decisions on system boundar-
ies should be sufficient to judge whether or not more detailed
examination is desirable and to permit subsequent changes to

"In order to facilitate complete LCA studies involving re-
frigerants and foam blowing agents, several studies have been
performed to characterize the environmental impacts of fluid
manufacture. The general conclusion was that the impact from
producing the fluids was small compared to that arising from
their use during service and their eventual disposal (Banks et
al., 1998; Campbell and McCulloch, 1998; McCulloch and
Campbell, 1998; McCulloch and Lindley, 2003). The most sig-
nificant contribution to the impact for producing fluids comes
from material, such as other fluorocarbons, released during the
manufacturing process and there is a wide variation in the val-
ues used. The highest values were calculated by Banks ef al.
(1998) who used maximum permitted emissions rather than
real values. The other studies used actual process records so
that the amount of material released was not only lower but
also decreased substantially in recent years as the treatment
of vent gases to avoid their release to the atmosphere became
more commonplace, particularly in the new plants to manufac-
ture HFCs (Campbell and McCulloch, 1998; McCulloch and
Campbell, 1998; McCulloch and Lindley, 2003).

outputs, enabling a matrix of flows, based on the reference flow,
to be constructed. This constitutes the Life Cycle Inventory. In
the subsequent stages of LCA, the environmental impacts of the
inputs and outputs identified in the inventory are assessed. For
the materials addressed in this report, the most obvious impact
categories are climate change and ozone depletion but some or
all of the additional categories described in 3.5.1 above may
be important (ISO, 2000a and 2000b). The end product is a de-

tem in terms of the effects on the most appropriate individual
categories, together with an indication of how significant that
impact is for each category. There is no scientific basis for re-
ducing LCA results to a single overall score or number (ISO,
1997) and, similarly, there is little justification for closely rank-
ing impacts (although it is worth noting when one impact, such
as that on climate change, clearly outweighs the rest). A data
documentation format for Life Cycle Assessments has been de-
veloped (ISO, 2002) to facilitate common input. Data collec-

such as motor vehicle manufacture (Finkbeiner e¢ al., 2003) and

There is an almost universal preference for mobile air con-
ditioning, even in colder climates. The only limiting factor is
the cost of the system, which typically has to be covered when
purchasing the vehicle. Certain types of systems — refrigera-
tors, unitary air conditioning products and water chillers — have
universal usage characteristics and can therefore be manufac-
tured in centralized facilities. This simplifies quality control
and reduces the likelihood of leaks, and thus the need for ser-
vice. Nevertheless, since high ambient temperatures create an
increased demand for servicing due to higher mechanical stress
on the systems and longer periods of operation, and considering
that most repairs currently lead to emissions of the refrigerant,
hot climates tend to have higher levels of refrigerant emissions
than cooler climates. In other sectors, for example most com-
mercial refrigeration systems, the installations are too custom-
or location-specific to be manufactured in a centralized facility,
although research is underway to change this (UNEP, 2003c).

are often mandatory in nature. These might not be compatible

Montreal Protocol. A completely different issue is the open use
of solvents. For some open uses in medium-size consuming op-

uses with internal recycling of the solvents. In other uses, in
particular cleaning in smaller workshops, the solvent will evap-
orate into the atmosphere. Low labour costs and, thus, less auto-
mated production tend to support the open use of solvents. As in
the case of the refrigeration sector, the large number of users in
non-homogenous solvent applications makes the spreading of
know-how a complex and labour-intensive undertaking (UNEP,
2003d). There are no substantial technical barriers to phasing
out ODSs in the solvent sector. Alternatives are available that

"For closed-cell rigid insulating foams, a large portion of the
blowing agent remains in the foam until the end of its useful
life (UNEP, 2003b). Consequently, the disposal practice (land-
fill compared with incineration) has a large influence on the di-
rect emissions from a system (i.e., a refrigerator or a building)
insulated with foams blown with fluorocarbons. Foam disposal
requires collection from a large number of individual users or
retrieval from a large quantity of mixed solid waste such as de-
molished building rubble. This is further complicated by the fact
that, in some cases, the foams are integrated with other materi-
als, for example, when used as building material it is adhered to
substrates. These factors will make collection a major logistical
and legal undertaking, which has not been mastered except in
certain subsectors like domestic refrigeration, and even there,
only a few countries are implementing such measures (UNEP,
2003b). As most foam products are lightweight compared to
their volume, transportation costs prohibit their transportation
over long distances, unless the foam is only a small fraction of
the final product or system (i.e., a refrigerator). Addition, the
movement of foam products, in particular building insulating
foams, is further hindered by building construction traditions
and building code requirements, which differ significantly be-

Emissions arising during use of a fluorocarbon, or on dis-

graphical area than the point source emissions described above.
Furthermore, the losses are spread out over the service lifetime
of the system with system-dependent rates of release; for most
applications this will result in an emissions pattern that covers
several years after the system is charged. Future releases will
therefore depend on the release pattern from the current de-
ployment, future changes in the number of systems, how wide-

contained during usage and disposal. Methodological guidance
is available for monitoring current releases of HFCs and PFCs

HEC- 23 (trifluoromethane) is formed at the reactor stage
of the manufacture of HCFC-22 (chlorodifluoromethane) as a
result of over-fluorination. Its formation is dependent upon the
conditions used in the manufacturing process and amounts to
between 1.5—4.0 % of the quantity of HCFC-22 produced. Its
production can be minimized by optimizing process conditions
but the most effective means of elimination is destruction by
thermal oxidation (Irving and Branscombe, 2002). Thus, the
emission factor F, for HFC-23 lies between zero and 4%. Use
of a single value (3%) as the default emission rate (Irving and
Branscombe, 2002), although allowed in the methodology for
calculating national greenhouse-gas emissions (IPCC, 2000a),
is not likely to give a credible forecast. In many cases, actual
HFC-23 emission rates are recorded in national greenhouse-gas
inventories (UNFCCC, 2003) and these can be used as informa-

rate relative to HCFC-22 production). It should also be possible
to take into consideration national regulations that will affect
such emissions in order to generate more robust predictions.

Consideration of the long-term production databases for
a wide range of industrial halocarbons, including CFCs and
HCFCs, has shown that the compound growth model can be se-
riously misleading. It fails to replicate the shape of the demand
curve over time for any of the materials examined (McCulloch,
2000). This appears to be because it does not address the chang-
es which occur over the product lifetime. Therefore whereas
growth during the early stages of product life may be com-
pound, and hence directly related to an economic parameter
such as GDP, it assumes a linear relationship with time when
the product becomes more mature and then starts to assume
an asymptote at full maturity. As S-curve has been shown to
best represent the actual shape of the demand curve over time,
the curve used to describe the growth and decline of biological
populations (Norton et al., 1976; McCulloch, 1994b, 1995b and
1999). There is however no fixed time cycle and some products
reach maturity far sooner than others. In the short term (say ten
to fifteen years) it may be permissible to forecast future demand
on the basis of a relatively simple function based on the histori-
cal demand. A product in its early life could be forecast to grow
at a rate governed by the growth in GDP (the compound growth
model); similarly, one that has reached more mature status may
have a linear growth rate, increasing by the same mass rate each
year. The completely mature product will have reached a con-
stant demand (and may, in fact, be subject to falling demand if
there is replacement technology).

In all forms of modelling it is essential to establish the drivers
of technological change and to assess their effects on demand.
In the case of refrigeration and air conditioning as a whole,
continuing improvements to system engineering have resulted
in significant reductions in the absolute rates of leakage. In
turn, this has allowed similar reductions in charge size, so that
the inventory of refrigerants has been reduced together with
the quantities required by original equipment manufacturers
(OEMs) and for servicing. The scope for such reductions was
reported in IPCC/TEAP (1999). Changes of this nature may
originate in developed economies but is by no means confined
to them. Furthermore, the adoption of new technology in the
rest of the world could be expected to accelerate as the manu-

towards developing economies.

In the ideal case, the historical connection should be estab-
lished between economic parameters and the demand for re-
frigeration, insulation and other categories in which HFCs and
PFCs can be used, so that the parameter with the best fit can be
chosen. Preferably, the analysis should be done on a regional or
even a national basis, but it is unlikely that sufficient data would
be available for this. Then the same methodology as used in the
bottom-up models should be applied to translate this demand
into emissions of individual compounds. In the form of this
model it is unlikely that the timing of emissions can be rigor-
ously estimated and so the sensitivity of the result to changes in
the assumptions about the timing of emissions is essential. This
allows the major failing of top-down models (that deviations
from reality are perpetuated throughout the modelled period) to
be addressed, with the possibility of making changes in the light

Once a forecast for the overall demand for a function has
been established, the extent to which the HFC or PFC is de-
ployed in that function can be estimated using a substitution
fraction and a view of how that fraction might change in the fu-
ture. There is now a body of data that describes recent substitu-
tion fractions and the changes expected in the coming decades
(Enviros March, 1999; Forte, 1999; McFarland, 1999; Harnisch
and Hendriks, 2000; Harnisch and Gluckman, 2001; Haydock
et al., 2003). The most accurate substitution data will be found
by examining current technical data for each compound in each
application. In almost all cases, the potential for substitution is
greater than the actual extent of substitution. Enforced changes
in technology have provided the opportunity to switch to com-
pletely different materials and techniques (the not-in-kind solu-
tions), to improve recovery and recycling (McFarland, 1999)
and to significantly reduce charge in each installation (Baker,
1999). The requirements for continuing economic and environ-
mental improvements will serve to drive these in the direction
of further reductions in the substitution fractions.

An important future task in using assessment methods such

for the climate impact of emissions of different substances, for
example, the choice of sets of GWP values which can come
from the second or third IPCC assessment report or from other
more recent sources, or the application of other metrics for the
radiative impact of substance emissions (see Fuglestvedt et al.

authors to publish enough interim results to allow the recalcula-

In view of the many assumptions and different method-
ologies, an important role has been identified for comparisons
between technologies using a common set of methods and as-
sumptions as well as for the development of simple and prag-
matic standard methodologies and the respective quality cri-
teria. A future international standardization of simple as well
as more complex or comprehensive evaluation methodologies
will be important. An advanced level of international consis-
tency has already been achieved in the field of health and safe-
ty. However, international standardization processes consume
considerable amounts of time and resources (from scoping, via
drafting and review to finalization). More timely and flexible
processes will therefore be required as well. Whereas current
standards are mainly based on low-toxicity, non-flammable flu-
ids, standardization committees must also prepare proper stan-
dards which consider the limits and conditions for the safe use
of fluids that are flammable or show higher toxicity. An essential
input for this is the global standardization of international levels
of requirements in respect to health, safety and environmental
performance as well as respective test methods and classifica-

tions.

Ensuring the faithful application of existing assessment
methodologies by all players in order to provide information
relevant for decisions, is an ongoing challenge. A decision-
maker may want to ensure that the full life cycle of the appli-
cation has been considered, that all relevant stakeholders have
been involved in the scoping and execution of the analysis and
in the review of its results, that accepted emissions monitoring
protocols have been applied for direct and indirect emissions,
that all costs are properly accounted based in the best available
figures, and that the uncertainties, sensitivities and limitations
of the analysis have all been clearly identified.

"A systems perspective is usually used to select a technology.
This takes into account the system’s life-cycle costs, its energy
consumption and associated emissions, health and safety im-
pacts, and other environmental impacts. The available assess-
ment methods for each of these attributes have been described
in this chapter. These will often need to be adapted to the spe-
cific application region concerned. A decision-maker can avoid
inconsistencies by initiating concerted technology comparisons
of competing technologies under common rules. In any case
decision-makers need to make their decisions in the light of
the remaining uncertainties and limitations of the available as-
sessment methods, such as Total Equivalent Warming Impact
(TEW)D), the Life Cycle Climate Performance (LCCP) or a Life
Cycle Assessment (LCA).

Cost is clearly one of the most important factors driving
decisions for or against certain technologies. Private decision-
makers usually take a life-cycle cost perspective based on their
enterprises’ rules for depreciation times and capital costs for
their investment. Policymakers commonly use different rules
and parameters to judge the cost-effectiveness of different
measures. As this Special Report has shown, there is still little
public cost information available which policymakers can use
to reach a judgement about the cost-effectiveness of measures.
Many firms give considerably less weight to social costs than
to private costs in making their decisions. Initial exploratory
studies would seem to be a worthwhile means of filling this
gap. In the future it might be useful to apply uniform costing
methodologies with common standards for transparency and
data quality.

Alternative refrigeration technologies such as the Stirling

In 2002, the total amount of refrigerants banked in domestic
refrigeration amounted to 160,000 tonnes, with annual refriger-
ant emissions of 5.3% of banked system charge. The annualized
HFC emissions rate from this sector was 1.0% in 2002. HFC
emissions mostly occur during useful life. Production transition
to HFCs started during 1995; consequently in 2002 the installed
product age was 7 years or less compared to a typical lifespan
of 20 years. Further, recovery during service and disposal is
required in most early conversion countries.

Vapour compression technology is mature and readily
available worldwide. The availability of capital resources is
dictating the timing of conversion to HC-600a and HFC-134a.
Current technology designs typically use less than half the elec-
trical energy required by the units they replace. This reliable
performance is provided without resorting to higher cost or
more complex designs. Continued incremental improvements
in unit performance and/or energy efficiency are anticipated.
Government regulations and voluntary agreements on energy
efficiency and labelling programmes have demonstrated their
effectiveness in driving improved efficiency product offerings
in several countries.

"Good design and the implementation of good manufactur-
ing and service practices will minimize refrigerant emissions;
however, special attention must be given to the retirement of
the large number of units containing CFC-12. With a typical 20-
year lifespan, refrigerator end-of-life retirement and disposal
happens to about 5% of the installed base each year. This means
approximately 75 million refrigerators containing 100 grams
per unit, or 7500 total tonnes of refrigerant are disposed of an-
nually. This refrigerant will be predominantly CFC-12 for at
least another 10 years. The small refrigerant charge means that
refrigerant recovery is not economically justifiable. Regulatory
agencies around the world have therefore provided incentives
or non-compliance penalties to promote recovery of this ODS.

Isobutane (HC-600a) and HFC-134a are the dominant al-
ternative refrigerants for replacing CFC-12 in new domestic
refrigeration appliances. Each of these has demonstrated mass
production capability for safe, efficient, reliable and economic
use. Both refrigerants give rise to similar product efficiencies.
Independent studies have concluded that application design
parameters introduce more efficiency variation than that at-
tributable to the refrigerant choice. Comprehensive refrigerant
selection criteria include safety, environmental, functional, cost
and performance requirements. The choice of refrigerant can
be strongly influenced by local regulatory and litigation envi-
ronments. Each refrigerator typically contains 50-250 grams
of refrigerant contained in a factory-sealed hermetic system. A
simplified summary of the relative technical considerations for
these two refrigerants is:

Domestic refrigerators and freezers are used throughout the
world for food storage in dwelling units and in non-commercial
areas such as offices. More than 80,000,000 units are produced
annually with internal storage capacities ranging from 20 litre
to greater than 850 litre. With an estimated average unit lifes-
pan of 20 years, this means there is an installed inventory of
approximately 1500 million units. As a result of the Montreal
Protocol, manufacturers initiated transition from CFC refrig-
erant applications during the early 1990s. This transition has
been completed in developed countries and significant progress
has been made in developing countries. The typical lifespan for
domestic refrigerators means that products manufactured using
CFC-12 refrigerant still comprise approximately one-half of
units in the installed base. This has significantly slowed down
the rate of reduction in the demand for CFC-12 refrigerant in

the servicing sector.

Systems that use ammonia and hydrocarbons as primary re-
frigerants in indirect systems operate in several European coun-
tries. Published results show that ammonia and hydrocarbon
indirect systems have a 10-30% higher initial cost than direct
expansion systems and an energy consumption 0—20% higher
than that of direct expansion systems, due to the additional sys-
tem requirements (heat exchanger and circulating pumps with
their costs and energy penalties). Development work on indi-
rect systems design is continuing with the goals of reducing the
cost and energy penalties in these systems.

Supermarket centralized direct systems consist of a series
of compressors and condensers located in a remote machinery
room, providing a cooling medium to display cabinets and cold
storage rooms in other parts of the building. The size of sys-
tems can vary from cooling capacities of 20 kW to more than
1 MW, as used in larger supermarkets. Refrigerant charge sizes
can range from 100-2000 kg. The most common form of cen-
tralized system is direct expansion. Specific units can be dedi-
cated to low-temperature or medium-temperature evaporators.

Condensing units are small commercial systems with com-
pressors and condensers located external to the sales area, and
the evaporators located in display cases in the sales area, or in
a cold room for food storage. These units are installed in shops
such as bakeries, butchers and convenience stores as well as in
larger food retailer stores. Similar refrigerants are used in these
applications as in stand-alone equipment; however, with the
larger refrigerant charges in these systems (1-5 kg), hydrocar-
bon refrigerant applications may be limited by national safety
standards. Refrigerant emissions depend on the robustness of
the system design, installation, monitoring and refrigerant re-
covery at end of equipment lifetime.

The ‘distributed’ system is a variation of the direct system.
In this the compressors are located in sound-proof boxes near
the display cases, permitting the shortening of refrigerant cir-
cuit length and a corresponding 75% reduction of refrigerant
charge. Condensing units can be air-cooled or water-cooled.
When compressor systems are installed as small packs with
roof-mounted, air-cooled condensers, or as small packs adjacent
to the sales area in conjunction with remote air-cooled condens-
ers, they are sometimes referred to as close coupled systems.
The refrigerants used are mainly HCFC-22 and the low-temper-
ature refrigerants R-404A and R-507A. Other refrigerants such
as R-410A are also being considered. With the close-coupled
system design, refrigerant emissions are estimated to be 5—7%
of charge on an annual basis. Compared to the centralized sys-
tems, the absolute reduction in refrigerant emissions is much
greater due to the considerable reduction in refrigerant charge
size.

Refrigeration equipment types vary considerably in terms
of size and application. Stand-alone equipment consists of sys-
tems where the components are integrated, such as beverage
vending machines, ice cream freezers and stand-alone display
cases. Refrigerant charge sizes are small (0.2—1 kg), and the
CFCs CFC-12 and R-502 are being replaced by HFCs HFC-
134a, R-404A and R-507A. HCFC-22 is also used, but is sub-
ject to phase-out requirements. Refrigerant emissions are low
in these mainly hermetic systems and are similar to domestic
refrigerator emissions. However, end-of-life recovery is almost
non-existent on a global basis and this results in an average
annual leakage of 7—-12% of the refrigerant charge, dependent
on the equipment lifetime. Some stand-alone equipment us-
ing hydrocarbons as refrigerants have been developed and are
available in European countries, with refrigerant charge sizes
in accordance with the limitations imposed by European and
national safety standards.

times greater than the supply of frozen products. Frozen food
in long-term storage is generally kept at -15°C to —30°C, while

Traditional supermarket centralized direct systems must

overall perspective, significant research and development is un-

Industrial refrigeration includes a wide range of cooling
and freezing applications in the chemical, oil and gas industries
as well as in industrial ice-making, air liquefaction and other re-
lated industry applications. Most systems are vapour compres-
sion cycles, with evaporator temperatures ranging from 15°C
down to —70°C. Cryogenic applications operate at even lower
temperatures. Capacities of units vary from 25 kW to 30 MW,
with systems often being custom made and erected on-site.
Refrigerant charge size varies from 20—60,000 kg. The refrig-
erants used are preferably single component or azeotropes, as
many of the systems use flooded evaporators to achieve high ef-
ficiency. Some designs use indirect systems (with heat transfer
fluids) to reduce refrigerant charge size and to the risk of direct
contact with the refrigerant.

These refrigeration systems are normally located in indus-

refrigerant. The second refrigerant in terms of volume use is
HCFC-22, although the use of HCFC-22 in new systems is

being replaced by R-410A, as the energy efficiency of R-410A
is slightly higher than that of HCFC-22. The energy efficiency
of R-410A can be similar to that of ammonia for evaporation

Low GWP refrigerant options will technically be available
for transport refrigeration uses where fluorocarbon refrigerants
are presently used. In several cases, these low GWP options
may increase the costs of the refrigeration system, which is an
important consideration for owners of transport equipment. A
technology change from an HFC, such as R-404A, to a low-
GWP fluid will usually lead to a reduction of TEWI, if the en-

Transport refrigeration consists of refrigeration systems for
transporting chilled or frozen goods. Transport takes place by
road, rail, air and sea; further, containers as refrigerated systems
are used with moving carriers. All transport refrigeration sys-
tems must be sturdily built to withstand movements, vibrations
and accelerations during transportation, and be able to operate
in a wide range of ambient temperatures and weather condi-
tions. Despite these efforts, refrigerant leakage continues to be
a common issue. It is imperative that refrigerant and spare sys-
tem parts are available on-board and along the transport routes.
Ensuring safe operation with all working fluids is essential, par-
ticularly in the case of ships where there are limited options for
evacuation.

The non-HFC refrigerant hydrocarbons, ammonia and car-
bon dioxide are under evaluation, and in some cases these are
being used for transport applications in the various sectors, with
due consideration for regulatory, safety and cost issues. Fishing
trawlers in the North Pacific Ocean already use ammonia for re-
frigeration, with a smaller number of trawlers using R-404A or
R-507A. Carbon dioxide is a candidate refrigerant for low-tem-
perature refrigeration, but the specific application conditions
must be carefully considered. Carbon dioxide systems tend to-
wards increased energy consumption during high-temperature
ambient conditions, which may be significant when containers
are closely stacked on-board ships, leading to high condensa-
tion/gas cooler temperatures because of lack of ventilation. In
the case of reefer ships and fishing vessels, a promising alter-
native technology is equipment with ammonia/carbon dioxide
systems. These systems have similar energy efficiency to exist-
ing refrigeration systems but higher initial costs.

Refrigeration applications vary widely in size and tempera-

60-140 W of electrical power and containing 40-180 g of re-
frigerant, to industrial and cold storage refrigeration systems
with power requirements up to several megawatts and con-
taining thousands of kilograms of refrigerant. Refrigeration
temperature levels range from —70°C to 15°C. Nearly all cur-
rent applications use compression-compression refrigeration
technology. The potential market size for this equipment may
approach US$ 100,000 million annually. This diversity has re-
sulted in unique optimization efforts over the decades, which
has resulted in solutions optimized for different applications.
For discussion purposes, the refrigeration sector is divided into
the five subsectors:

Most new refrigerators or freezers employ either HC-600a or
HFC-134a refrigerant. Each of these refrigerants has demon-
strated mass production capability for safe, efficient, reliable
and economic use. There are no known systemic problems with
properly manufactured refrigerator-freezers applying either of
these primary options. The key variables influencing selection
between these two refrigerants are refrigerator construction de-
tails, energy efficiency, building codes, environmental consid-
erations and the economics of complying with standards. Other
selected alternative refrigerants or selected refrigerant blends
have had limited regional appeal, driven by either niche appli-

"Conversion of the historic application of CFC-12 refrigerant in
these units to ozone-safe alternatives was initiated in response
to the Montreal Protocol. Comprehensive refrigerant selection
criteria include safety, environmental, functional, performance
and cost requirements. A draft refrigerant selection-decision
map and a detailed discussion of requirements were included
in the 1998 report of the Refrigeration, Air Conditioning, and
Heat Pumps Technical Options Committee (UNEP, 1998). The
integration of these requirements with other potential drivers
such as global-warming emissions reduction, capital resource
availability and energy conservation results in a comprehensive
analysis of refrigerant options for strategic consideration. Two
different application areas must be addressed: (1) new equip-
ment manufacture, and (2) service of the installed base. New
equipment manufacture can be addressed more effectively,
since the ability to redesign avoids constraints and allows op-

HFC-134a refrigerant: HFC-134a applications require syn-
thetic polyolester oil as the lubricant in the hermetic system.
This oil is moisture sensitive and requires enhanced manufactur-
ing process control to ensure low system moisture level. HFC-
134a is chemically incompatible with some of the electrical
insulation grades historically used with CFC-12. Conversion to
the electrical insulation materials typically used for HCFC-22
applications may be necessary. HFC-134a is not miscible with
silicone oils, phthalate oils, paraffin oils or waxes. Their use
should be avoided in fabrication processes for components in
contact with the refrigerant. Common items for concern are mo-
tor winding lubricants, cutting fluids in machining operations
and drawing lubricants. Careful attention to system cleanliness
is required to avoid incompatible contaminants. Trace con-
taminants can promote long-term chemical degradation within
the system, which can reduce cooling capacity or cause sys-
tem breakdown. Necessary process controls are not technically
complex but do require competent manufacturing practices and
attention to detail (Swatkowski, 1996).

tirement and disposal happens to about 5% of the installed base
every year. In quantified terms this means approximately 75
million refrigerators containing approximately 100 g per unit
or 7500 total tonnes of refrigerant are retired and disposed of
annually. For the next few years, or possibly even decades,
CFC-12-containing product will continue to be a significant
fraction of the waste stream. As is the case for service recovery,
the small refrigerant charge makes end-of-life recovery uneco-
nomical. Equipment and procedures commonly used for refrig-
erant recovery during service can be used but recovery is more
typically accomplished in central disposal locations. This al-
lows the use of faster, less labour-intensive procedures to mod-
erate recovery costs. Nevertheless, regulations and non-com-
pliance penalties normally provide incentives for this recovery.
Regulating agencies in various global regions administer these
requirements and are an appropriate source for further informa-
tion.

Conversion of the service demand has been less successful.
Field service procedures typically use the originally specified
refrigerants. The long useful product life (up to 30+ years for
some units with an average around 20 years), large installed
base (approximately 1500 million units) and uncertainties with
field conversion to alternative refrigerants have resulted in a
strong continuing service demand for CFC-12. The estimated
percentage of refrigerators requiring post-warranty service of
the hermetically sealed system and replacement of the origi-
nal refrigerant charge at sometime during their service life is
1% in industrialized countries and 7% in developing countries.
In industrialized countries this demand is typically satisfied
with reclaimed or stockpiled CFC-12 when not contrary to
local regulations. (Note: ‘Reclaimed’ refrigerant refers to re-
covered refrigerant that has been purified to original specifica-
tions. Unpurified recovered refrigerant should never be used in
long-life domestic refrigerators. Probable impurities are likely
to catalyze systems degradation and cause premature failures.)
CFC-12 is normally the lowest cost refrigerant in developing
countries. Regardless of location, use of the CFC-free refriger-
ant service blends mentioned above only becomes significant
when CFC-12 availability becomes limited. Since post-war-
ranty service is typically provided by small, independent busi-
nesses, reliable service demand data are not available. Further,
the limited capital resources in developing countries promotes
the labour-intensive refurbishing of units compared to retire-
ment and replacement with new units. This not only prolongs
the phase-out of CFC-12, but also results in increased failure
rates from the highly variable quality of workmanship.

On a global basis, commercial refrigeration is the refrigera-
tion subsector with the largest refrigerant emissions calculated
as CO, equivalents. These represent 40% of the total annual re-
frigerant emissions, see Table 11.5. Annual leakage rates high-
er than 30% of the system refrigerant charge are found when
performing a top-down estimate (Clodic and Palandre, 2004;
Palandre er al., 2004). This means that in an environment with
an average energy mix, the refrigerant emissions might repre-
sent 60% of the total emissions of GHG resulting from system
operation, the rest being indirect emissions caused by power
production. This indicates how important emission reductions

from this sector are.

Thermodynamic cycle efficiencies of the alternatives are

Hybrid systems cover a range of possibilities where there
is a combination of types. An example is a variation of the dis-
tributed system approach, where low-temperature cabinets and
cold stores comprise individual water-cooled condensing units,
which are supplied by the medium-temperature HTF. Thus, in
the indirect medium temperature section, the refrigerant charge
is isolated mainly to the machinery room, whilst an HTF is cir-
culated throughout the sales and storage areas at this tempera-
ture level.

Full supermarket systems can be categorized by whether
refrigerant evaporation occurs in the coolers, or whether a low-
temperature secondary heat transfer fluid (HTF) that is cooled
centrally is circulated in a closed loop to the display cabinets
and cold stores. The first type is termed ‘direct expansion’ or
direct system and the second type is termed indirect system.
Direct systems have one less thermal resistance and no separate
fluid pumping equipment, which gives them an inherent effi-
ciency and cost advantage. The HTF circulated in an indirect
system normally gains sensible heat, but may gain latent heat in
the case of ice slurry or a volatile fluid like CO,.

"Distributed Systems are characterized by having smaller com-
pressors and condensers close to or within the coolers, so that
many sets of compressor/condenser units are distributed around
the store. The compressors can be installed within the sales area
with remote condensers. When they are installed as small packs
with roof-mounted, air-cooled condensers, or as small packs
adjacent to the sales area in conjunction with remote air-cooled
condensers they are sometimes referred to as Close Coupled
Systems. The quantity of such units could range from just a few
to upwards of 50 for a large supermarket. They are direct sys-
tems, but when installed inside the building that may employ a
HTF, usually water, for collecting heat from the different units.

"In some countries, indirect, close-coupled, distributed and
hybrid systems have been employed in increasing number in
recent years because they offer the opportunity of a significant
reduction in refrigerant charge. Additionally, with indirect sys-
tems the refrigerant charge is normally located in a controlled
area, enabling the use of low-GWP refrigerants that are flam-
mable and/or have higher toxicity. This approach has been
adopted in certain European countries due to regulatory con-
straints on HCFCs and HFCs (Lundqvist, 2000). A review of
possible system solutions is provided by Arias and Lundqvist
(1999 and 2001). The close-coupled systems offer the advan-
tages of low charge, multiple compressors and circuits for part
load efficiency and redundancy, as well as the efficiency advan-
tage of a direct system (Hundy, 1998).

Stand-alone equipment consists of systems where all the
components are integrated: wine coolers, beer coolers, ice cream
freezers, beverage vending machines and all kinds of stand-
alone display cases. This equipment is installed in small shops,
train stations, schools, supermarkets and corporate buildings.
Annual growth is significant. All types of stand-alone equip-
ment are used intensively in industrialized countries and are
the main form of commercial refrigeration in many developing
countries. These systems tend to be less energy efficient per
kW cooling power than the full supermarket systems described
below. A main drawback to stand-alone units is the heat rejected
to ambient air when placed indoors. Therefore, the heat must be
removed by the building air conditioning system when there is
no heating requirement.

Many different designs of full supermarket systems can be
found. Centralized systems consist of a central plant in the form
of a series of compressors and condenser(s) located in a ma-
chinery room or an outside location. This provides refrigerant
liquid or an HTF at the correct temperature levels to cabinets
and cold stores in other parts of the building. Each rack of mul-
tiple compressors is usually associated with a single air-cooled
condenser. Specific racks are dedicated to low-temperature or
medium-temperature evaporators. The quantity of refrigerant is
related to the system design, refrigerating capacity and refriger-
ant choice varies. The centralized systems can be either direct
or indirect systems. Centralized direct systems constitute by far
the largest category in use in supermarkets today. The size can
vary from refrigerating capacities of about 20 kW to more than
1 MW. The centralized concept is flexible in order to utilize
heat recovery when needed (Arias, 2002).

As well as measures designed to decrease emissions, there
are also drivers — typically at field level — that inhibit emis-

include partial success in finding system leaks, end-users em-

a preventative basis, additional attendance time for refrigerant

in emission and emission projection studies has been collated
from telephone interviews, and other similar techniques, from

underestimated emissions, since both the end-users and refrig-

fugitive emissions, ruptures, emissions during servicing and at

In the 1980s, the reported average commercial refrigera-
tion emission rates for developed countries were in the range
of 20-35% of refrigerant charge per year (Fischer et al., 1991;
AEAT, 2003; Pedersen, 2003). The high emission rates were due
to design, construction, installation and service practices being
followed without an awareness of potential environmental im-
pact. In some countries emissions from these systems have been
decreasing due to industry efforts and governmental regulations
with respect to refrigerant containment, recovery and usage re-
cord keeping, increased personnel training and certification,
and improved service procedures, as well as increased attention
for many system mechanical details including the reduction or
elimination of threaded joints and a reduction in the number of

joints in refrigerating systems.

assisted by an industry supported certification model (STEK,

223 supermarkets in the California South Coast Air Quality
Management District (Los Angeles area). The data were re-
ported in system charge sizes from 23 kg up to 1285 kg. Over
the two-year period, 77% of the smaller charge size systems
(23-137 kg) required no refrigerant additions, 65% of the me-

additions and 44% of the larger charge size systems (456-1285

expected, based on larger charge size systems having longer
piping runs, more assembly joints, more valves and more op-

Various companies in several countries have developed vend-

The equipment uses HC-600a, HC-290 and HC-based blends.
Limitations on charge sizes are specified by safety standards
(e.g. EN 378, IEC 60335-2-89), where maximum amounts per
circuit are 2.5 kg, 1.5 kg and 150 g, dependent on the applica-
tion. Nevertheless, HC charges tend to be about 50% less than
equivalent HFCs and HCFCs due to lower densities which
minimize the impact of such limits. Recent developments with
charge-reduction techniques (Hoehne and Hrnjak, 2004) sug-
gest that charges for future systems will become even less.

At low temperatures, phase-changing CO, HTF shows
promising results. Due to the viscosity constraint of other al-
ternatives at low temperatures and the good heat transfer prop-
erties of CO,, the use of CO, as a low-temperature HTF has
received more consideration than the alternatives. When CO,
is used with phase change, the diameter of the tubes can be
significantly reduced, and the heat transfer in the display case
heat-exchanger is far more effective. If the temperature can be
maintained below —12°C, traditional technologies in which the
tubes and heat exchanger are designed for a maximum operat-
ing pressure of 25 bar, are possible. About 50 such systems are
in operation in Europe. Expansion vessels, cold finger concepts
or simply using the cold stored in the goods, are possible alter-
natives for keeping the pressures within acceptable limits.

between direct and indirect systems are difficult (Lundqvist,

systems is initial cost. Due to the design of heat exchangers in
display cases (especially medium-temperature, open-type) the
performances of some indirect systems can be equal or even
slightly better than direct systems (Baxter, 2003a). For low tem-

the energy consumption of centralized systems are plotted in
which the origin of energy inefficiencies are apparent. Due to
the extra temperature difference required, inherently indirect
systems should give higher energy consumptions compared to
direct systems. Recent practical experiences and experimental
studies (Mao et al., 1998; Mao and Hrnjak, 1999; Lindborg,

indirect systems may have energy efficiencies approaching

al. (2003). Cost is still an issue, typically up to 30% higher, but
further development is expected to reduce costs. HC-290 and
HC-1270 are excellent refrigerants from a thermodynamic point
of view and equipment design is relatively straightforward. The
availability of some standard components is still limited, but to
a certain extent the hydrocarbon systems can use the same type
of system components as HFC systems. Cascade systems with
HC-290 and CO, for full supermarket systems were reported to
have an energy efficiency equal to conventional direct system
design (Baxter, 2003a,b).

kets with costs ranging from 20-280 US$ per tCO,—eq miti-
gated. The lowest values are given for a system using direct

R-404A for high temperature. Mitigation costs are estimated
using a 10% leakage rate and a 1.5 % recovery loss, with a 10-
year lifetime and a discount rate of 10% to reflect commercial
decision-making. An average cost of 100 US$ m? of supermar-

"Ongoing R&D efforts to minimize refrigerant charge without
compromizing energy efficiency are applicable to HFC refriger-
ants as well. The standard approach to charge minimization is to
use no receiver or hermetic compressors and to keep piping as
short as possible. Tight systems require brazed joints and these
are most reliably made when systems are factory assembled.
The potential for charge reduction is illustrated by Fernando
et al. (2003). They present HC systems using as little as 150 g
refrigerant for a 5 kW domestic heat pump. The density of HFC
refrigerant is approximately twice that of HC and therefore a
comparable system using 300 g of HFC refrigerant is within
reach, if further heat exchanger development is undertaken.
More complex cycles are another way of improving systems.

The annual global consumption of frozen foods is about 30
Mtonnes yr‘. Over the past decade, consumption has increased
by 50% and it is still growing. The USA accounts for more than
half of the consumption, with more than 63 kg per capita. The
average figure for the European Union (EU) is 25 kg and for
Japan 16 kg. The amount of chilled food is about 10-12 times
greater than the supply of frozen products, giving a total vol-
ume of refrigerated food of around 350 Mtonnes yr! (1995)
with an estimated annual growth of 5% (IIR, 1996; UNEP,
2003). Like chilling and freezing, food processing is also of
growing importance in developing countries. This is partly due
to the treatment of high-value food products for export. Even
in 1984, about half of the fish landed in developing countries
(more than 15 Mtonnes) was refrigerated at certain stages of
processing, storage or transport (UNEP, 1998). The estimated
annual growth rate in food processing between 1996 and 2002
was 4% in developed countries and 7% in developing countries
(UNEP, 2003).

R-410A is also one of the HFC blends which is expected
to gain a market share in food processing and cold storage ap-
plications due to the lower compressor swept volume require-

compressor efficiencies, pressure drop in suction lines and
heat transfer efficiency will benefit from high system pressure
(UNEP, 1998). Due to the high volumetric capacity (40% above
that of HCFC-22), R-410A compressor efficiency has been re-
ported to be higher than with HCFC-22 (Meurer and Kénig,
1999). R-410A can have system energy efficiency similar to
that of ammonia and HCFC-22 and significantly higher than
that of R-404A and R-507A for evaporation temperatures down

Commercialized refrigerants used in food processing and
cold storage applications include HC-290, HC-1270 and HC-
290/600a blends, although pure substances will be preferred in
flooded systems. All of these refrigerants possess vapour pres-
sures very similar to those of HCFC-22 and R-502. System
performance with regard to system efficiency is comparable to,
and in some cases even superior to, that of the halocarbons.
Hydrocarbons are soluble with all lubricants, and compatible
with materials such as metals and elastomers that are tradition-
ally used in refrigeration equipment. As long as safety aspects
are duly considered, standard refrigeration practice for HCFCs
and CFCs can be used without major system detriment to sys-
tem integrity (UNEP, 1998, 2003).

successfully so far. Various analytical and experimental studies
have shown that the COP of compression-absorption systems is
comparable to that of vapour compression systems. However,
this system suffers from the inherent disadvantage of being cap-

The recovery and recycling of refrigerants is another important
process that results in significant reductions in emissions. The
purpose of recovery is to remove as much refrigerant as pos-
sible from a system in the shortest possible amount of time. For
applications where maintenance operations require opening the
circuit, the difference between deep recovery and ‘normal re-
covery’ can represent 3—5% of the initial charge (Clodic, 1997).
However many countries have adopted final recovery vacuum
requirements of 0.3 or 0.6 atm absolute depending on the size
of the cooling system and saturation pressure of the refriger-
ant. This provides a recovery rate of 92-97% of the refrigerant
(UNEP, 1998).

Servicing practices in refrigeration systems must be improved
in order to reduce emissions. Topping-off cooling systems with
refrigerants is a very common practice, especially for the large
systems normally used in food processing and cold storage in-
dustry, which causes greater emissions of refrigerant. However
in general, proper servicing has proven to be more expensive
than topping-off refrigeration systems. It is therefore necessary
to make end-users understand that their practice of topping-off
the systems without fixing leaks must cease because of the in-
creased emissions to the environment. The good service prac-
tices are preventive maintenance, tightness control and recov-
ery during service and at disposal.

"After proper designing of the system, installation is the main
factor that leads to proper operation and containment during
the useful life of the equipment. Tight joints and proper piping
materials are required for this purpose. Proper cleaning of joints
and evacuation to remove air and non-condensable gases will
minimize the service requirements later on and results in re-
duced emissions. Careful system performance monitoring and
leak checks should also be carried out during the first days
of operation and on an ongoing basis. The initial checks also
give the installer the opportunity to find manufacturing defects
before the system becomes fully operational. The proper instal-
lation is critical for maximum containment over the life of the
equipment (UNEP, 2003). The refrigeration system should be
designed and erected according to refrigeration standards (e.g.
EN378 (CEN, 2000/2001)) and current codes of good practice.

The refrigeration system design plays a vital role in minimiz-
ing the refrigerant emissions. A proper system design includ-
ing heat exchangers, evaporators and condensers can minimize
the charge quantity and hence reduce the potential amount of
emissions. Every effort should be made to design tight systems,
which will not leak during the system’s lifespan. The poten-
tial for leakage is first affected by the design of the system;
therefore designs must also minimize the service requirements
that lead to opening the system. Further, a good design and the
proper manufacturing of a refrigerating system determine the
containment of the refrigerant over the equipment’s intended
life. The use of leak tight valves is recommended to permit the
removal of replaceable components from the cooling system.
The design must also provide for future recovery, for instance
by locating valves at the low point of the installation and at each
vessel for efficient liquid refrigerant recovery (UNEP, 2003).

less than this, and this is probably due to more leak-proof de-

HFC- 410A is not comparable to refrigerants HCFC- 22
or CFC-12 in terms of thermodynamic properties because of
its considerably higher vapour pressure. HFC-410A compres-
sor efficiencies, the pressure drop in suction lines and the heat
transfer efficiency will benefit from high system pressure. This
HFC is used mainly in new industrial systems designed for the
refrigerant, especially in terms of low condensing temperatures
of 35°C to avoid pressures higher than 25 bar. In industrial re-
frigeration, the evaporator temperature range for HFC-410A
varies from —60°C to —35°C. Due to the high volumetric capac-
ity (40% above that of HCFC-22), compressor efficiency has
been reported to be higher than with HCFC-22 (Meurer and
K6nig, 1999). R-410A has a COP similar to NH, and HCFC-22
and slightly higher than that of R-404A, R-507A. Further, at
temperatures below —40°C and up to the to HFC-410A normal
boiling point at —51.6°C, COPs are slightly higher for R-410A

"A comparative study for low temperatures has been carried out
using a typical system design with cooling capacities of 600kW
at —54°C for R-410A, R-507 and ammonia used as a single fluid
in two-stage systems and for NH,/CO, and HFC-134a/R-410A
as refrigerants in high/low stage cascade systems. The volumet-
ric refrigerating capacity of CO, is five times higher than HFC-
410A and eight times higher than for ammonia and other refrig-
erants. Therefore the size of most components in the system can
be reduced. The study found the lowest cost for NH CO, (Roth
et al., 2002). If CO, is used as the refrigerant, the cost ‘break-
even point for industrial refrigeration compared to NH, and R-
410A is approximately at an evaporating temperature of —40°C
to —45°C. Below this temperature, lower costs for CO,/NH,
cascade systems have been achieved. It is expected that costs
for screw or reciprocating units, including compressors and oil
separation circuit, will be further reduced (Roth et al., 2002).
The efficiency of CO, systems in this low temperature range is

similar to other refrigerants such as R-410A or ammonia.

due to a higher risk of collisions with other objects. Ensuring
safe operation with all working fluids is essential, particularly

The technology used in transport refrigeration is mainly the
mechanically- or electrically-driven vapour compression cycle
using refrigerants such as CFC, HCFC, HFC, ammonia or car-
bon dioxide. Due to the complete and worldwide phase-out of
CFC consumption by the end of 2009, CFCs are not addressed
in this chapter. In addition, a number of refrigeration systems
are based on using substances in discontinuous uses. This type
of equipment can be found as open uses with solid or liquid
CO,, ice, or liquid nitrogen and in these cases the refrigerant
is being completely emitted and lost after removing the heat
(Viegas, 2003). Closed systems such as eutectic plates (Cube
et al., 1997) or flow-ice, reuse the same substance (Paul, 1999).
Such systems used to be very commonplace in transport refrig-
eration, and are still used on a significant scale. Some propose
that their use should be increased i in the future.

Refrigerated transport vessels, also called reefers, provide
transportation for perishable foodstuff at temperatures between
—30°C and 16°C (Cube ef al., 1997). It is estimated that there
are around 1300 to 1400 reefer vessels in operation (Hochhaus,
2002; Hochhaus, 1998), a number which has been constant for
quite some time and is expected to decrease. In 2001, it was
reported that more than 95% of the refrigeration installations on
these vessels use HCFC-22 as a refrigerant (SCANVAC, 2001),
although various HFCs such as HFC-134a, R-404A, R-507 and
R-407C as well as ammonia are being used. About two-thirds of
the systems are direct systems with up to 5 tonnes of refrigerant
per system and the remaining are indirect systems with a charge
below 1 tonne of refrigerant (UNEP, 2003). Estimates of cur-
rent annual leakage rates based on known refrigerant consump-
tion are 15-20% of the system charge (SCANVAC, 2001).

Different technologies have been used in the past: Solid CO,
as well as ice have been used in discontinuous emissive systems
to date (CTI, 2004). Mechanically-driven refrigeration systems
have also been used and are now the prime choice because of
the typically long duration of trips, which makes refilling of the

equipped with diesel engines to supply the necessary energy to
the refrigeration unit. The existing fleets of railcars in Asia still
seem to mostly operate on one-stage (cooling) and two-stage
(freezing /combined use) CFC-12 systems (UNEP, 2003). The
European railcars have been converted to HFC-134a (Cube et

The predominant technology i in road transport, covering vir-
tually all of the remaining refrigerated road transport equipment,
is the mechanical vapour compression cycle. Trailers usually
have unitary equipment that consists of a diesel engine, com-
pressor, condenser, engine radiator and evaporator with fans as
well as refrigerant and controls. These systems are also used
for swap bodies. Larger trucks often have similar equipment
as trailers. However, as the truck size decreases an increasing
proportion of systems have the compressor being driven by the
drive engine (ASHRAE, 2002). Alternatively, some truck sys-
tems use a generator coupled with the truck engine to generate
electricity, which is then used to drive the compressor (Cube et
al., 1997).

In 1999, it was estimated that in North America alone 300,000
refrigerated trailers were in use (Lang, 1999). For the 15 coun-
tries of the European Union in 2000, 120,000 small trucks, vans
and eutectic systems with 2 kg refrigerant charge were estimated
to be in use, with 70,000 mid-size trucks of 5 kg refrigerant fill-
ing and 90,000 trailers with 7.5 kg refrigerant filling (Valentin,
1999). The worldwide numbers in 2002 were estimated to total
1,200,000 units, with 30% trailer units, 40% independent truck
units and 30% smaller units. The annual amount of refrigerant
needed for service is reported to be 20-25% of the refrigerant
charge (UNEP, 2003). The refrigerant typically chosen is HFC-
134a for applications where only cooling is needed, and pre-
dominantly R-404A and R-410A for freezing applications and
general-purpose refrigeration units (UNEP, 2003).

"Road transport refrigeration units, with the exception of refrig-
eration containers, are van, truck or trailer mounted systems.
Some trailers are equipped to be mounted or have their main
bodies mounted on railroad systems; these are so-called swap-
bodies. In a number of uses those systems are of the discon-
tinuous type, using eutectic plates in closed systems (Cube et
al., 1997) or liquid nitrogen, liquid carbon dioxide or solid car-
bon dioxide in open systems (UNEP, 2003). These systems are
frequently used in local frozen food distribution, for example,
delivery directly to the customer (Cube ef al., 1997). Liquid
nitrogen for cooling purposes is used by more than 1000 ve-
hicles in the UK. Liquid carbon dioxide is reported to be used
in 50 trucks in Sweden (UNEP, 2003). In general, the necessity
for storage and filling logistics, the hazardous handling of very
cold liquids and solids and the energetically unfavourable low-
temperature storage reduce the widespread application of these
historically frequently used technologies.

Recovery and recycling is a statutory requirement in many
countries and is probably adhered to since the equipment con-
tains a considerable, but still easy-to-handle, amount of refrig-
erant and due to its mobility it can easily be transported to a
recovery facility (except seagoing). On the other hand due to
the large emission rates in operation, the improvements through
recovery and recycling, which encompass only the refrigerant
losses during service and disposal, are likely to be limited.

While equipment for service trolleys for passenger trains is

Current system requirements lead to a refrigerant selection
which is largely limited to HFC-134a and refrigerant mixtures
with a relatively high global-warming impact such as R-404A.
Since the emission rates in operation are significant, improve-
ments in energy consumption, alternative substances and not-in-
kind technologies are the main options for emission abatement.
R-404<A is the main refrigerant in current use (IIR, 2002) and
is popular because of its flexibility (medium- and low-tempera-
ture applications) and safety. Only a limited number of TEWI
calculations are available in the literature; the only investigation
comparing different technologies such as CFC-12, HFC-134a,
R-404A, HC-600a/HC-290, ammonia and CO,, states that R-

"As there are already considerable incentives to optimize de-
sign and to minimize leakage, further containment in most uses
would require a new approach not yet seen. One example might
be to use fully hermetic systems for road transport (Chopko

consumption has yet to be determined. The development of
hermetic scroll compressors for container systems with accept-
able energy efficiency for both cooling and freezing applica-
tions (Yoshida et al., 2003; DeVore, 1998) allows their wide-
spread use, and leads to less service requirements and therefore
less related refrigerant losses. In addition, these compressors
are hermetic, which further decreases leaks (Wild, 2003). This
technology has already been introduced and is penetrating the
market as existing equipment is gradually replaced.

Technically this solution could be adopted worldwide in cer-
tain road and railroad systems, especially in compact systems.
Nevertheless, either certain existing regulations or present sys-
tem use patterns would have to be adapted. The flammability
of hydrocarbons will require additional safety measures, thus
increasing the costs of the system, and in the beginning at least
probably insurance rates as well. Containers might also require
changes in the transporting ships.

"Ammonia as refrigerant is being increasingly used in marine
refrigeration equipment. Applications include its use in reefers
(Stera, 1999), as a proposed refrigerant for sorption ice ma-
chines (Garrabrant, 2003), and the use in fishing vessels both as
a single refrigerant (UNEP, 2003; Berends, 2002) and in com-
bination with CO, (Nielsen and Lund, 2003). The applicability
has been sufficiently proven. Ammonia as a refrigerant requires
certain design considerations as well as the presence of addi-
tional safety equipment on board (SCANVAC, 2001).

For low-temperature uses, combinations of ammonia and
CO, have been developed and built into ships. A comparison
shows that the efficiency for a—40°C evaporation and 25°C con-
densing temperature is 17% higher than for a 2-stage HCFC-22
system (25% improvement at —50°C/25°C) (Nielson and Lund,
2003). The advantage of using CO, in such applications is that
the necessary components (in particular the compressor) are
commercially available or require only minor modifications,
while consuming, less space than other solutions.

Hydrocarbon cooling systems for the recondensation of trans-
ported hydrocarbons have successfully been installed in gas
tankers. International activities are underway to develop hydro-
carbon systems for reefer ships (Jakobsen, 1998). In road trans-
port refrigeration, commercially available systems have been
developed in Australia, Germany and other European countries
using HC-290 (propane). The systems require a leak detector
in the trailer and special driver training to fulfil safety-related
legal requirements (UNEP, 2003; 3; Frigoblock 2004).

"There are a number of possibilities to improve those trans-
port refrigeration systems built today to achieve a lowering of
direct or energy-consumption related emissions without chang-
ing the working fluid or technology. A number of measures have
been proposed and these have in part already been implemented
to improve the energy efficiency, for example, the use of ef-
ficient compressors, frequency control for part load conditions,
water-cooled condensers for containers on board ships, regular
preventive maintenance and so forth. Measures to control direct
emissions have mainly been proposed for mass-produced sys-
tems (e.g. container units) in terms of design improvements.

"Carbon dioxide as a refrigerant in mechanically-driven vapour
compression systems, might be used as a subcritical refriger-
ant (critical point at 31°C) with a condensing temperature well
below the critical point in cascade systems or in applications
where low-temperature cooling options means are available.
Alternatively, it can be used as a near-critical or, more likely,
a super-critical working fluid. If the condensing temperature of
CO, is below 15°C (border of subcritical region), this refriger-
ant typically offers, but not always, significant advantages in
terms of efficiency and costs in comparison to other refriger-
ants. This advantage can only be utilized in cascade systems
with other refrigerants or where low-temperature heat sinks are
available. Near- or super-critical uses require a much higher
pressure resistance of the equipment than is currently usual for

In the case of container systems, CO, in a vapour compres-

for the refrigeration system might be higher than for current
conventional systems. The energy consumption will probably

Options using CO, and hydrocarbons exist for road trans-
port. The hydrocarbon technology is technically implementable
within a short time frame. For larger systems, CO, systems or
hydrocarbon refrigerants are potential options, depending on
the safety issues. The same alternatives could be used for new
railway systems. Certain types of refrigerated road transport,
such as short-range distribution trucks, might use discontinuous
systems with evaporating CO, or nitrogen as alternative.

"nology is equipment with ammonia or ammonia/CO, systems.
These systems are likely to operate at least as energy efficiently
as existing systems. One source (SCANVAC, 2001) estimates
the additional costs for a ship-bound ammonia system to be 20-
30% higher if retrofitted into an existing vessel and potentially
lower if included in the ships planning from the start. Another
source (Nielsen and Lund, 2003) assumes that small industrial
ammonia/CO, systems might be more expensive than conven-
tional systems, but large systems might have a more or less
equivalent price for the same capacity.

Residential and commercial air-conditioning and heating

to emit that refrigerant to the atmosphere; however, emissions
can occur due to numerous causes. The effects of refrigerant
gas emissions are quantified by multiplying the emissions of a
refrigerant in kg by its global warming potential (GWP). The
emissions calculated are on a kgCO,-equivalent basis. If more
than a few specific systems are analyzed then it is appropriate
to use average annual emission rates for each type of system to
calculate the comparative direct greenhouse-gas emissions.

of 2.2 x 10° kW cooling. Refrigerant charge quantities vary in
relation to the capacity. Assuming an average charge of 0.25
kg per kW of capacity, those 358 million units represent an

An extensive literature review on the performance of hydrocar-
bon refrigerants was performed in 2001 (ARTI, 2001). Many
articles reported that refrigerants such as propane offer similar
or slightly superior efficiency to HCFC-22 in air-conditioning
systems. Few rigorous comparisons of fluorocarbon and hydro-
carbon systems have been reported. However, the available data
suggest that efficiency increases of about 2-5% were common
in drop-in ‘soft-optimized’ system tests. In a system specifically
optimized for hydrocarbons, it might be possible to achieve ef-
ficiency increases somewhat greater than 5% by using propane
rather than HCFC-22, assuming no other fire safety measures
need to be taken which would reduce efficiency. In certain coun-
tries safety regulations require the use of a secondary loop and
this significantly reduces the efficiency of the hydrocarbon sys-
tem and increases its cost compared to the HCFC-22 system. In
order to offer equipment which meets the market requirements
for the lowest cost, manufacturers will need to determine how
the costs of safety improvements required for hydrocarbon sys-
tems compare with the costs required to raise the efficiency of
competing systems. Safety standards are likely to vary around
the world and this may lead to different choices. Vigorous de-
bates among advocates of hydrocarbon and competing refriger-
ants are likely to continue, due to the differences in perceived

tics as a refrigerant: availability, low-toxicity, low direct GWP
and low cost. CO, systems are also likely to be smaller than sys-
tems using other common refrigerants but will not necessarily
be cheaper (Neksa, 2001). There is a significant amount of con-

parity to better performance. Additional research and develop-

Including the life-cycle climate performance (LCCP) as a

residential and commercial air-conditioning and heating equip-

in an optimum design that is different from one just optimized
for lowest cost. By optimizing for the best LCCP, the designer
will also improve on a number of other parameters, for example,
the design for energy efficiency, the type and amount of refrig-
erant used in the unit (determined by refrigerant cycle design),
reduced leakage (service valve design, joining technologies,
manufacturing screening methods, sensor technologies for the
early detection of refrigerant leaks), and reduced installation
and service losses (factory sealed refrigerant circuits, robust

equipment and higher energy efficiency standards (13 SEER in
the US) are in place, an HFC blend refrigerant is likely to rep-
resent a large part of the market for new equipment. The results
generally show that direct warming impacts due to life-cycle
refrigerant emissions are less than 5% of the LCCP. The differ-
ence in the indirect warming component of LCCP at different
efficiency levels is much greater. Propane and CO, emissions
have a negligible warming impact. However, the possible addi-
tional cost for using propane safely or for achieving a given ef-
ficiency level with CO,, exceeds the difference in cost between
the 12 and 14 SEER performance levels, which have a greater
impact on LCCP than the direct warming from refrigerant emis-

The principal components of a vapour-compression chiller
are a compressor driven by an electric motor, a liquid cooler
(evaporator), a condenser, a refrigerant, a refrigerant expan-
sion device, and a control unit. The refrigerating circuit in
water chillers is usually factory sealed and tested; the installer
does not need to connect refrigerant-containing parts on site.
Therefore leaks during installation and use are minimal.

For many years, centrifugal chillers were the most com-

compressors were used in smaller chillers. From the mid-1980s
onwards, screw compressors became available as alternatives
to reciprocating compressors in the 140-700 kW range and as
alternatives to centrifugal compressors in the range up to about
2275 kW. Scroll compressors were introduced at about the

Full-load COP is commonly used as a simple measure of
chiller efficiency. With the increasing recognition of the domi-
nant contribution of the power consumption of chillers to their
GWP, more attention has been paid to the energy efficiency of
chillers at their more common operating conditions. In a single-
chiller installation, chillers generally operate at their full-load or
design point conditions less than 1% of the time. Manufacturers
developed techniques such as variable-speed compressor drives,
advanced controls, and efficient compressor unloading methods
to optimize chiller efficiency under a wide range of conditions.
In the US, ARI developed an additional performance measure
for chillers called the Integrated Part Load Value (IPLV) which
is described in ARI Standard 550/590 (ARI, 2003). The IPLV
metric is based on weighting the COP at four operating condi-
tions by the percentage of time assumed to be spent at each of
four load fractions (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) by an individ-
ual chiller. The IPLV metric takes into account chiller energy-
reducing features which are increasingly becoming common
practice, but are not reflected in the full-load COP.

waste heat is available in the form of steam or hot water, where
electricity is not readily available for summer cooling loads,
or where high electricity cost structures (including demand

Japan, government policy encourages absorption systems so as
to facilitative a more balanced gas import throughout the year

taking equipment out of service. Charging and storing the re-

In asystem optimized for hydrocarbons, one might be able to
achieve efficiency increases of more than 5% by using propane
instead of HCFC-22. In the literature, efficiency comparisons
for HCFC, HFC, and HC systems sometimes show substantial
differences but do not represent rigorous comparisons. This is-

Hydrocarbon refrigerants have a long history of application in
industrial chillers in petrochemical plants. Before 1997 they
were not used in comfort air-conditioning chiller applications
due to reservations about the system safety. European manu-

northern Europe (UNEP, 2003). This is a small number com-

"Chillers using ammonia as the refrigerant are available in the
capacity range 100-2000 kW and a few are larger than this. The
use of ammonia is more complex than that of many other refrig-
erants because ammonia is a strong irritant gas that is slightly
toxic, corrosive to skin and other membranes, and flammable.
Recommended practice (ASHRAE, 2001a; ISO, 1993; CEN,
2000/2001) limits the use of large ammonia systems in public
buildings to those systems, which use a secondary heat trans-
fer fluid (which is intrinsic in chillers), so that the ammonia is
confined to the machine room where alarms, venting devices,
and perhaps scrubber systems can enhance safety. Guidelines
are available for the safe design and application of ammonia
systems (IEA, 1998, Chapter 4; ASHRAE, 2001a). Modern,

Some countries have implemented the use of water-LiBr
absorption chillers in trigeneration systems. Trigeneration is
the concept of deriving three different forms of energy from
the primary energy source, namely, heating, cooling and power
generation. This is also referred to as CHCP (combined heat-
ing, cooling, and power generation). This option is particularly
relevant in tropical countries where buildings need to be air-
conditioned and many industries require process cooling and
heating. Although cooling can be provided by conventional va-
pour-compression chillers driven by electricity, heat exhausted
from the cogeneration plant can drive the absorption chillers so
that the overall primary energy consumption is reduced.

end-of-life refrigerant recovery rate. A comparison of the LCCP
values for the propane and HFC-134a air-cooled screw chiller/

or propylene (HC-1270) as refrigerants in small residential and
commercial water-to-water and air-to-water heat pumps. The
hydrocarbon circuit is located outdoors using ambient air, earth,
or ground water sources, and is connected to hydronic floor
heating systems (IEA, 2002).

In most applications HC-290 will yield an energy efficiency
comparable to or slightly higher (e.g., 5-10% higher) than that
of HCFC-22. The performance difference increases in heat
pumps at lower ambient temperatures. When designing new
heat pump systems with propane or other flammable refriger-
ants, adequate safety precautions must be taken to ensure safe
operation and maintenance. Several standards that regulate the
use of hydrocarbons in heat pumps exist or are being devel-
oped in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. An example is
European Standard EN 378 (CEN, 2000/2001).

“Small capacity (0- 30 kW) air-to-water - heat pump chillers
for residential and light commercial use in combination with
fan-coil units are popular in China as well as Italy, Spain, and
other southern-European countries. Hot water delivery tem-
peratures are in the 45—55°C range. In the future, the market
growth of small air-to-water heat pumps may be slowed in
some markets by the growing popularity of variable-refriger-
ant-flow systems combined with multiple, indoor fan coil units
connected to a refrigerant loop for direct refrigerant-to-air heat
transfer.

It is clear that different sources provide vastly different
emission estimates. Similar differences are seen for refrigerant
banks. Some of the differences shown above can be explained
by the transition from ODS to non-ODS refrigerants (e.g., in
1996 relatively few HFC units existed, whereas by 2005 sub-
stantially more HFC units had been installed). However, the
major difference in the estimates is due to the data and method-

Carbon dioxide is being introduced as a refrigerant for heat
pumps, particularly those with a DHW function. Japan and
Norway have been leaders in the development of CO, water-heat-
ing heat pumps. Because there is government support in Japan
for the introduction of high-efficiency water heaters, 37,000 heat
pump water heaters were sold in Japan in 2002 that used CO, or
R-410A as refrigerants. The sales are estimated to have increased
to 75,000-78,000 units in FY 2003 (JARN, 2004b).

"These studies point to the dynamic and competitive nature
of the air-conditioning market, especially as the transitions from
CFCs and HCFCs to HFCs and other refrigerants, as described
earlier in this chapter, occur. Therefore due consideration must
be given to the data used, the assumptions made, and the meth-
odologies employed in estimating refrigerant banks and emis-
sions. The differences that arise for current estimates of banks
and emissions are large, and are often further exacerbated when
projecting future banks and emissions. Some of the aspects that

Estimates for residential and commercial air conditioning and

are sometimes divided into subcategories. For instance, some
studies report separate estimates for air conditioners (for cool-

separate emissions of water-heating heat pumps as described

The remaining options concentrate on other items highlighted
earlier in this chapter (e.g., recovery, alternative refrigerants).
Many of these options are assumed to partially exist in the base-
line (e.g., recovery occurs to some extent) and are assumed to
increase if the option is applied. Note that some costs are nega-
tive, indicating that energy-efficiency improvements or lower
refrigerant costs render the option cost effective under the as-

Current regulatory policies ignore the additional fuel con-
sumption of air-conditioning (AC) system operation. It might
be technically possible to reduce the fuel consumption of the
AC system by up to 30-40%, depending on the option chosen
and the climate. This could lead to a global reduction in CO,
emissions of 40 Mtonnes yr'. -

Improved HFC-134a systems have a low leakage rate and a

might be obtained with a full professional service that includes
recovery, recycling and systematic end-of-life (EOL) recovery.
This would require refrigerant management policies governed

CFC-12 was not widely used within the EU due to the very
low number of air-conditioned cars before 1995. However, there
have been increasing concerns about the significant increase of
HFC-134a use in Europe. In its Fluorinated Gas regulation proj-
ect, the European Commission has proposed the phase-out of
HFC-134a, thereby creating a totally new context for refriger-
ant choices.

There are three main options for reducing greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions: Improving the current HFC-134a system or
switching to other low global warming potential (GWP) refrig-
erants such as HFC-152a or CO,. Other options such as hy-

did not support these as a possible alternative technology. Other

If all types of refrigerants are considered, emissions from
MAC systems range from approximately 105,000 tonnes of
CFC-12 in 1990 to 137,000 tonnes of CFC-12 and HFC-134a in
2003, with CFC-12 still representing 46% of those emissions.
A business-as-usual scenario forecasts emissions in the range of
180,000 tonnes in 2015 (see Figure 6a), most of which will be
HFC-134a. The CO,-eq emissions fell from about 850 MtCO,-

The rapid switch from CFC-12 to HFC-134a was a global
decision taken by all car manufacturers in developed countries.
The first HFC-134a system was installed in 1990 and by 1994
almost all vehicles including cars, light commercial vehicles,
and truck cabins, sold in developed countries used this refrig-
erant. In developing countries the transition from CFC-12 to
HFC-134a will be completed in 2008. Since 1990, significant
progress has been made in limiting refrigerant emissions and
the implementation of the Montreal Protocol has contributed
to this. For example, recovery equipment has been developed,
some countries have encouraged the intensive training of ser-
vice technicians to improve servicing practices, component
manufacturers have designed low-emission components (fit-
tings, hoses, etc.) and car manufacturers have usually lowered
the original refrigerant charge. These efforts led to a significant
decrease in emission levels from about 400 g yr! in the late
1980s to about 200 g yr’ in the mid-1990s (UNEP, 1998) and
efforts are still underway to further reduce these emission levels
to 100 g yr! or less (Schwarz and Harnisch, 2003).

and 15% of the original charge. Servicing is assumed to take

"The average refrigerant charge depends on the type of car and
the type of refrigerant. Usually HFC-134a systems have about

charges vary from 500-900 g. The lifetime of the MAC system
(9-12 years) is usually considered to be shorter than the car

A third trend is to change the energy source of the power-
train by replacing the internal combustion engine with a fuel
cell. MACs adapted to this type of powertrain will benefit from
the high level of electrical power available and will be able to
compensate long stop & go as well as heating or cooling deficits
of the cabin. One example exists in Japan, where there is a fuel
cell vehicle equipped with electrical hermetic CO, heat pump

The first trend is improvements in the energy efficiency of
internal combustion engines (diesel or gasoline). This trend af-
fects both the heating and the cooling modes of the MAC sys-
tem. In cooling mode, a higher engine energy efficiency results
in a higher relative energy penalty due to MAC. This requires
significant efforts to improve MAC energy efficiency. High-ef-
ficiency engines result in a heating cabin deficit which neces-
sitates the installation of an additional heating function. This is
why efficient heat pump systems are still being developed in
competition with current existing solutions based on electrical
heaters or burners.

As indicated in section 6.3.4, a number of programmes are un-

this, see (Benouali et a/., 2003c; Benouali et al., 2003a), the co-
efficient of performance (COP) measured under realistic condi-

temperature of 35°C. The use of an external control compressor
yields significant gains in the range of 25-35% on the COP,
even if the mechanical efficiencies of external control compres-
sors are in the same range as internal control compressors. Up
until now systems have been designed for low cost, reliability
and cooling capacity but not for energy efficiency. A number of
improvements can still be realized in the development of high
efficiency compressors. Improvements in the evaporator and

At present there is not an agreed leakage test method to
guarantee the leakage rate of an MAC system installed in a car.
Each supplier of compressors, condensers, evaporators, hoses,
etcetera, has their own methodology, using trace gases such as
helium, for checking the leak tightness of their components.
SAE standards (SAE, 1989, 1993) define a test method for hose
permeation but none of these permit certification of the emis-
sion level of AC systems installed in a car. Several projects are
underway to define a certification method that can ensure the
certified level of refrigerant emissions. Various publications
(Clodic and Fayolle, 2001; Clodic and Ben Yahia, 1997) indi-
cate a large range of leakage rates depending on the technol-
ogy used for hoses, compressor shaft seals and service valves.
A certification method will certainly need to be developed for
each component: The refrigerant lines, the two heat exchang-
ers and the compressor. Complementary calculations from test
results are necessary to predict annual emission. Moreover, the
leak rates depend on the refrigerant pressure and so in turn on
the climatic conditions under which the car operates throughout
the year.

and serves as the worldwide basis for the majority of car AC
systems which use carbon dioxide as a refrigerant. The p-h dia-

Carbon dioxide has zero Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP). Its
GWP of | is negligible compared to the GWP of HFC-134a.
Moreover, there is no need to specifically produce carbon diox-
ide, since it can be recovered from industrial waste gas. Carbon
dioxide (when used as refrigerant it is called R-744) is cheap,
readily available in sufficient quantities throughout the world
and its properties are well known and documented. If used as
refrigerant there is no need for recovery, which would neces-
sitate servicing, and the recycling cost would be totally elimi-
nated. The refrigerating equipment safety standard (ASHRAE
34, EN-378) classifies CO, as an Al refrigerant, a non-toxic
and non-flammable refrigerant. But if accidentally lost in large
quantities, CO, has a certain asphyxiation risk that needs to
be mitigated by engineering systems. A refrigeration cycle
with carbon dioxide as refrigerant operates at comparatively
high pressures (5-10 times higher than HFC-134a systems).

As the critical temperature is approached or even exceeded,
the ideal cycle efficiency decreases with increasing high-side
pressure. On an ideal basis, the efficiency of a transcritical CO,
cycle is unfavourable compared with that of a HFC-134a cycle.
However, for real cycles this is compensated by the favourable
transport properties of CO, (high heat transfer and low pres-
sure loss), the inclusion of an internal heat exchanger and the
improved compressor efficiency due to low pressure ratios.
Under normal operating conditions for vehicle air-conditioning
systems the carbon dioxide cycle often operates in the ‘tran-
scritical’ mode due to the low critical temperature (31°C). For
example, Pettersen (1994) showed that the high-side pressure
influences the COP of the system and there is an optimum pres-
sure for this. He suggested that during normal operation a high-
side pressure close to the optimum pressure should be selected
in order to maintain a satisfactory COP. This means the pressure
should be kept at a certain level dependent on the heat rejection

temperature (ambient air temperature).

Compared to HFC-134a, CO, has a disadvantage of low ef-
ficiency at idling and high load “conditions. Compact vehicles
are generally at a disadvantage as far as the refrigeration cycle
efficiency is concerned compared to medium or large vehicles.
This is due to space constraints which limit the condenser and
evaporator sizes. Actual vehicle tests have shown that in com-
pact vehicles, the increase in compressor power consumption
with CO, has an adverse effect on vehicle driving characteristics
such as acceleration and fuel economy, even though equivalent
or better cooling performance can be maintained (Kobayashi
et al., 1999). Further technical developments are required for
CO, compact vehicles to counteract this. An ejector, which can
recover the expansion energy and reduce the compressor power
might be a potential solution (Takeuchi et al., 2004).

"Carbon dioxide is a typical high-pressure refrigerant with a cor-
respondingly high volumetric cooling capacity. Therefore, com-
pared to low-pressure HFCs, higher cooling capacities can be
achieved in a given volume. This results in excellent cool down
curves (or heat up curves for the heat pumps) as demonstrated,
for example, by Vetter and Memory (2003). However, com-
paring the energy efficiency and fuel consumption of a carbon
dioxide and corresponding HFC system is far more difficult.
From the results in a number of publications it can be surmised
that compared to an improved HFC-134a system, carbon diox-
ide has a comparable or even better COP and a correspondingly
lower fuel consumption, especially for lower ambient air tem-

134a systems have advantages at lower compressor speeds.
Based on measurements made by Hrnjak (2003), Wertenbach
(2004) calculated the AC energy demand for typical European
and US driving cycles. His results show different energy de-
mands for Europe and the USA are due to the selected running
time in the drive cycles and the different climatic conditions.
Nevertheless the energy efficiency benefits of the systems are
about the same for Europe and the USA. Compared to a base-
line HFC-134a system, an improved HFC-134a system showed
23% less energy demand whereas an efficiency-optimized CO,
system showed about 30% less energy demand. Hafner et al.

(2004) obtained comparable results in their energy analysis.

This was a joint venture between the US government, a major
car manufacturer and a major MAC system supplier (Andersen

refrigerant and compared to the equivalent current HFC-134a
system it showed a better cooling performance for high loads
and a comparable cooling performance for low loads. In a direct

6% under any circumstance. An active safety system, such as a
refrigerant-based sensor safety concept (which is also currently
under scrutiny for flammable refrigerants), might not be effec-

and the actuators behind the sensor. The VDA ad hoc work-

concept based on supplementing the standard specifications
mentioned in Section 6.4.2.6. These additional specifications
would cover all AC systems from manual to automatic control
and would consider all vehicle operating conditions (Rebinger,

“safe evaporator’, which means a negligible risk of leaking or
bursting under any operating condition of the car.

system that was first tested with HFC-134a and then simply
charged with HFC-152a to provide a direct comparison with

The secondary loop system (Figure 6.9) was jointly dem-
onstrated by a major European car manufacturer and a major
MAC system supplier (Ghodbane and Fernqvist, 2003). The
system was demonstrated on a Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) with
front and rear evaporators. A secondary loop system (Figure
6.9) would overcome the concern of leakage into the passen-
ger cabin by allowing the refrigerant to be contained under
the hood where it is completely separated from the passenger
compartment. The refrigerant cools a chiller (liquid-liquid heat
exchanger), which, in turn, chills a water-glycol mixture that
is then pumped into the passenger cabin heat exchanger(s) for
cooling. This system would use the same components as the
current HFC-134a system, with the addition of a chiller and
liquid pump. It would therefore require a limited capital invest-
ment. For the dual evaporator SUV, the HFC-134a charge was
1.3 kg compared to just 0.59 kg of HFC-152a for the secondary
loop system — a significant reduction. This vehicle had one of
the highest cooling performances of all of the vehicles demon-
strated at the symposium.

Even if air is used as a refrigerant, with a zero GWP, the energy

energy penalty of about 35%. Nevertheless, from the TEWI

HEFC-134a systems and t the CFC- 12 systems they replaced,

for both vehicle occupants and service technicians. SAE J639

sign that must be met. For example, ‘For refrigerants contained

HEFC-152a has been assigned a GWP of 122 as opposed to
1410 for HFC-134a leading to a reduction in global warming
impact of more than 90%. Moreover, the lower liquid density of
HFC-152a compared to HFC-134a implies a refrigerant charge
that is only 65% of the reference HFC-134a charge. For exam-
ple, an HFC-134a system using 0.5 kg would be replaced by an
HFC-152a system using 0.325 kg. This reduction in refrigerant
charge will lead to lower emissions in the event of rupture and
at vehicle end of life. The greater energy efficiency of the HFC-
152a over HFC-134a would result in enough fuel savings to
offset the GWP of HFC-152a. The net result of replacing HFC-
134a with HFC-152a would be the elimination of the direct cli-
mate impact associated with current HFC-134a MAC systems.
This has also been shown by Hafner ef al. (2004). Table 6.10

the heating-up time needed before cooling capacity can be pro-

Metal hydride systems are interesting due to the small number

due to a far more effective diffusion of cooling or heat close to

Hydrocarbon technologies have been widely adopted in
several foam sub-sectors, including domestic appliances, wa-
ter heaters, polyurethane (PU) sandwich panels, PU boardstock
and some PU integral skin applications, and are expected to
represent >55% of overall blowing-agent usage globally in

"Following the mainstream introduction of HFC use in 2002, the
phase-out of the use of ozone-depleting substances in the foam
sector in the majority of developed countries is only now pro-
gressing towards completion. Consequently, predicting HFC
usage patterns has been notoriously difficult and the downsiz-
ing of HFC demand estimates has been a feature of the last
3-5 years, being driven significantly by the costs of HFC-based
systems when compared with other options.

Nevertheless, HFCs are being used in those applications
where investment cost, product liability, process safety, and
thermal efficiency are particularly important elements in the
decision process. Where HFCs are used, careful consideration
has been given to the use of blowing-agent blends for both cost
and environmental reasons. Co-blowing with CO, (water)! has
emerged as an important way of limiting HFC consumption
in key applications such as the US appliance industry and the

It is now estimated that global HFC consumption in the
foam sector is unlikely to exceed 75,000 tonnes annually in the
period to 2015. This represents around 20% of the consumption
that would have been associated with CFCs in the absence of
the Montreal Protocol and around 50% of the uptake anticipated
when the situation was first reviewed at the IPCC/TEAP Petten
Conference in 1999. Not-in-kind insulation materials, such as
mineral fibre, have continued to be the predominant choice in
most global markets, primarily because of cost. Accordingly,
foams are only used where their "" properties add value.

This assessment concurs broadly with the estimate in the 2003
TEAP HCFC Task Force Report (UNEP-TEAP, 2003), despite
the different method used. Table 7A summarizes the projected
consumption and emission pattern as at 2015, together with an
assessment of the remaining blowing agent bank. The fact that
annual emissions are not equivalent to annual consumption fig-

As shown in Table 7A, emissions of HCFCs are expected
to plateau in the 20,000-25,000 tonnes per annum range in the
period after 2005, with decreases in production emissions from
phase-out in developed countries being offset by emissions from
domestic refrigerators at end of life. In contrast, the trend for
HFC emissions will continue to be gradually upwards through
the period of assessment as the bank builds. However, the most
significant bank remains that related to CFCs. This is partly as-
sociated with the long period of historic use, but the impact of
emissions on climate change is accentuated by the high average
global warming potential (GWP) of the CFCs emitted. On the
basis of current projections, and if there is no effort to instigate
further end-of-life emission reduction options, the impact of
CFC emissions will remain predominant, at least until 2050.

There is significant potential for managing emissions of

involve innovation in building construction, allowing for disas-

blowing agent and there is a particular opportunity to focus on
end-of-life issues both for recovery of existing materials con-

The future consumption patterns for HFCs in the foam sec-
tor beyond 2005 are heavily reliant on the wider role of foams
in energy conservation and, in particular, building renovation.
It is expected that spray foam techniques may have a particular
role to play. The development of well-grounded responsible-use
guidelines will be vital for both the foam industry and climate
change policymakers in order to ensure the most appropriate
use of HFCs and the control of emissions, where applicable.
However, in all cases, it will be necessary to assess the overall
incremental energy benefit, together with the non-preventable
direct emissions, in a policy-level comparison.

These ratios do not imply that it is always essential to use
HFC-blown foams to achieve the best overall thermal perfor-
mance, but do illustrate that small incremental changes in ther-

all emission benefits, primarily as a result of the long lifetime
of most buildings. The benefits can be particularly significant if

HCFC consumption in developing countries will be frozen
after 2015 under the Montreal Protocol and will be phased out
by 2040. In the business-as-usual analysis in this chapter, it is
assumed that the decline is linear between 2030 and 2040. There
is less certainty about HFC use beyond 2015, but the degree
of innovation that has marked the last 20 years would suggest
that the foam industry is unlikely to be reliant on HFCs beyond
2030. Accordingly, the business-as-usual analysis proposes a
freeze in consumption at 2015 levels and a linear decline in use

The implications of these relative benefits and limitations
vary substantially, both between products, within a category
and between applications. This makes a generic conclusion
about preferences impossible. The current thermal insulation
market supports a variety of solutions (at least 15 major prod-
uct types) and this reflects the range of properties demanded
for the applications served. Unfortunately, only limited data are
available covering the thermal insulation market at the global
and regional levels. One of the complexities of global-market
analysis is that building practice around the world varies, often
responding to material availability and climatic conditions.

"7.2.2.1 Buildings (including building services, renovations)
Global assessments of carbon dioxide emissions have consis-
tently revealed that emissions from the use of buildings (in-
cluding appliances used in buildings) represent 30-40% of the
global total. (Price et al., 1998). In the industrialized countries
of the northern hemisphere, this can rise as high as 40-50%
(Ashford, 1998). The reduction of these emissions depends on
two parallel strategies. The first consists of reducing the carbon
intensity of the energy used by fuel by switching to alternatives
with less carbon (e.g. natural gas) or by using more renewable
energy. The second consists of improving the energy efficien-
cy of the buildings themselves, including the appliances used
within them. The evaluation of some strategies developed by
governments in this area has made it increasingly clear that the
scope for fuel switching and the rate of investment in renewable
energy sources between now and 2050 will not be sufficient
to achieve sustainable carbon dioxide emission levels by 2050
(e.g. Carbon Trust, 2002). This has led to the recognition of
the central role of energy efficiency measures in any strategy
and the introduction of such ground-breaking measures as the
Energy Performance in Buildings Directive from the European
Union (OJ, 2003).

There have been several studies of the potential role of ther-
mal insulation in the achievement of these objectives. One re-
cent study (Petersdorff et a/., 2002) has demonstrated that the
technical saving potential through the more widespread use of
thermal insulation in Europe alone is more than 350 Mtonnes
CO,-eq/yr. This contrasts with earlier estimates (Ashford, 1998)
which took more account of other competing measures, but
concluded that the annual savings potential for the same region
was 150 Mtonnes CO,-eq/yr. In any event, the role of thermal
insulation in the future reduction of carbon dioxide emissions is
undeniable.

The appliance market is highly competitive in all regions of the
world and subject to stringent energy regulations in some plac-
es. The cost and performance characteristics of the insulating
material are therefore both important parameters. Furthermore,
the best possible insulation value is required in appliances to
reduce wall thickness and maximize internal space, while pre-
venting the settlement which could occur with other non-foam
insulation types. The use of polyurethane foam to insulate do-
mestic appliances started in Europe in the late 1950s as an alter-
native to mineral fibre, thereby revolutionizing production and
reducing energy consumption. The technology is now univer-
sally employed (although the transition was only completed in
the 1990s in developing countries) and has been a key factor in
achieving dramatic improvements in appliance efficiency.

Apart from specific insulation foams, one-component foams
(OCF) are very widely used in the building industry as gap fill-
ers around doors and windows, as well as in plumbing appli-
cations. They provide excellent seals against draughts, thereby
reducing the heat loss or gain by the building through improved
air-tightness. In addition, they have major economic benefits
because of their speed of application compared to any alterna-
tive method. The blowing agent acts both as a frothing agent
and as a propellant. Initially, CFC-12 was used, but this has
been replaced by a variety of alternatives including HCFC-22,
hydrocarbons such as butane, propane and dimethyl ether, or
HFC-134a and HFC-152a. This application is emissive and a
recent European Union Proposal for a Regulation (COM (2003)
492) will severely restrict the use of HFCs in this application
(UNEP-FTOC, 2003).

"One of the major challenges for governments is the identi-
fication of appropriate policies and measures for implementing
and encouraging improved energy efficiency in buildings. The
construction of new buildings is typically well-regulated and
provides a natural opportunity for increased energy efficiency
standards. However, targeting new building standards alone
will not deliver the required emissions savings, since most new
building activity is undertaken in response to overall economic
growth and social changes such as ageing populations and pop-
ulation migration. The daunting prospect for many governments
is that the demolition rates for existing building stock are less
than 0.5% per year and in some cases less than 0.2% (UNECE
(2002) Database). Accordingly, unless there is a major demoli-
tion and rebuilding programme, the focus of attention will need
to shift to measures required to renovate existing buildings.
This is not easy because governments cannot generally impose
requirements on existing owners. The problem is compounded
because many owners are not the occupiers (or the payers of
the energy bills), and costs and benefits are therefore not linked.
The assessment of cost-effectiveness criteria therefore becomes
critical, with discussion focusing on matters such as investment
costs, payback periods, discount rates and the like. In the end,
the questions to be answered are ‘who pays?’, ‘when?’ and
‘how much?’. Government intervention, particularly in the do-
mestic household sector, is expected to be a major part of many
national strategies and the costs need to be considered carefully
in order to get best value for investments (Ashford and Vetter,
2004).

Apart from its energy contribution, the foam also provides
strength as the core of sandwich elements, therefore reducing
the consumption of other materials previously needed for struc-

"‘inere are three distinct factors involved in projecting market
changes in the insulating foam sector. These can be listed as
follows:

(1) Overall economic activity based on GDP (as a default) or
on the number of units being produced in a given year.
Considering the major uses of foams, this would be the
number of buildings built/refurbished or the number of
appliances (e.g. domestic refrigerators or freezers) being
manufactured.

(2) The amount of insulation used per unit. This has tended to
increase as energy standards for appliances have been raised
or as building regulations have called for more insulation in
new buildings to meet energy efficiency requirements. The
expression used for this measure is the ‘foam-volume ratio’.
Increasing energy costs can also encourage greater use of
insulation, but the driver is relatively weak in most regions
because energy costs have dropped in real terms over recent
years.

(3) The third driver for market growth in the foams sector is
the relative share of the insulation market accounted for
by foams. Although the trend may be in either direction

HCFC-141b is the most widely used CFC substitution technol-

reasons are the modest transition costs, easy implementation,
similarity of end product performance (including energy) and
wide availability. HCFC-142b and HCFC-22 are used for ex-

limited to areas where the markets are sufficiently large to sup-

Similar considerations apply to sectors such as commercial
refrigeration and other insulation applications. It is important to
bear in mind that most industrial CFC conversions financed by
the Multilateral Fund could use equipment that supports non-
HCFC technologies such as CO, (water) and hydrocarbons.
However, the degree of penetration of hydrocarbon technolo-
gies has been limited by the availability of hydrocarbons of an
appropriate quality and by investment thresholds that set a cap
on the funding available to save a kilogram of CFC.

With limited further funding available to those who have
already made the transition, HCFCs are likely to remain in
widespread use in developing countries for a long time to come,
possibly until 2040. This is particularly true of those who faced
the challenge of CFC transition recently in stagnant economic
conditions and favoured HCFCs as the most cost-effective op-
tion. Similar transition challenges face smaller enterprises in
developed countries but, in this instance, the transition will be
forced by regional regulation no later than 2015.

Other reasons for the continued use of HCFCs vary accord-

ing to the application. The use of HCFC-141b as a blowing agent
for the insulation of domestic refrigerators is associated with a
potential lowering of energy consumption, which can assist in
limiting energy demand in domestic markets where there are
energy supply constraints. However, there may be constraints
on trade for HCFC-containing articles in some regions (e.g.
the European Union). Accordingly, HCFC-based technologies
may simultaneously constitute an advantage and a disadvantage
when multiple geographic markets are served. In summary, an
appliance manufacturer’s decision to use HCFCs, HFCs or hy-
drocarbons depends upon power supply and use, market forces,
and existing regulations relating to energy and ozone-depleting
substances in the targeted countries.

where the market considers the loss in thermal efficiency to be
offset by the other inherent properties of XPS boards (moisture
resistance, mechanical strength, compressive strength, dimen-
sional stability and resistance to freeze-thaw deterioration).
Higher densities or lower conversion may partially or wholly
offset the low cost of CO, itself in some XPS applications.
Furthermore, the use of CO,-based blowing-agent systems is
technically challenging, and not suitable for many existing

"In rigid polyurethane insulating foams, the use of cyclopentane

very rapidly gained wide acceptance in all regions. For building
applications, normal pentane is the most widely used isomer.
Normal pentane and cyclopentane/isopentane blends are typi-
cally used in rigid polyisocyanurate insulating foams in North
America. In domestic refrigerators and freezers, cyclopentane
was introduced in Europe in 1993 and it has gained acceptance
in all regions except the USA, where existing VOC-emission
regulations and stringent fire safety codes make the conversion
of existing facilities uneconomical. The technology has been re-
fined and optimized for cost-effectiveness and a blend of cyclo-
pentane/isopentane is gaining prominence. Despite the higher
thermal conductivity compared to foams based on HCFC-141b
or HFC-245fa, appliances based on the hydrocarbon option at-
tain the highest A+ energy efficiency category under the EU’s
stringent requirements. The technology provides good process-
ing and other foam characteristics. The safety precautions for
processing this flammable blowing agent are also well estab-
lished. However, the cost of the necessary safety measures and
the management infrastructure required can be uneconomical

for small enterprises.

As with rigid polyurethane foams, the use of HFCs in rigid
extruded polystyrene foams tends to be restricted to circum-
stances where other blowing agents are unsuitable (because of
safety, processability and/or performance), as their price makes
them too costly for many market segments. Systems based prin-
cipally on HFC-134a can match HCFC-142b thermal conduc-
tivity, and are used in applications where insulation value and/
or space are at a premium. HFC-134a is also long lived in the
foam and provides excellent insulation performance over time
(Vo and Paquet, 2004), making it suitable for applications with
long lifetimes. HFC-152a, on the other hand, leaves the foam
fairly quickly, but has improved processability. This makes it
easier to use for the creation of large cross-sections, where the
use of CO,- or HFC-134a-based systems are technically chal-

"Building (polyurethane, phenolic, extruded polystyrene)

The construction industry is very cost-competitive and the use
of HFCs in polyurethane rigid foams will naturally be restricted
to those applications and circumstances where other blowing
agents are unsuitable because of safety or performance fac-
tors. It is likely that the largest sector using HFCs will be the
spray foam industry, because of safety constraints on the use of
pentane and the product performance limitations (thermal con-
ductivity and density) when using CO, (water). Another major
sector, and one where small and medium enterprises are heavily
involved, is the production of discontinuous sandwich panels.
Here again, HFCs are expected to be the major blowing agent
because of the high costs of flame-proofing such equipment for
the use of HCs. The adoption of HFCs will only occur in the
larger boardstock or continuously-produced sandwich panel
sectors, where the end product has to meet very stringent flam-

"For phenolic systems used in the continuous boardstock sec-

properties of the foam matrix, the use of hydrocarbons has been
found to be more feasible (c.f. progress in Japan with isobutane)
than had been originally anticipated for foams used typically in
fire-sensitive applications. A further factor influencing the non-
selection of HFCs as blowing agents is the fact that phenolic
chemistry does not offer the co-blowing options available to
polyurethane systems. Accordingly, the blowing-agent compo-
nent of formulations can be in excess of 10% in some instances,
with significant cost implications. Nonetheless, the use of HFCs
(particularly HFC-365mfc/HFC-227ea blends) is expected con-
tinue in a significant proportion of the phenolic foam market for
the foreseeable future, particularly if fire performance standards
continue to become more stringent, as is currently the case in

North America as HCFC-141b has been replaced, and may also
increase in some other regions as HCFCs are ultimately phased

Although hydrocarbons are being successfully used as the
blowing agent for refrigerator and freezer production in most
regions of the world, there are some situations, most notably in
North America, where manufacturers have chosen HFCs as the
preferred replacement for ozone-depleting substances in this
application. Their reasoning is that HFCs can provide the supe-
rior insulation performance needed to meet existing, stringent,
energy standards while meeting customer demand for storage
capacity, product dimensions and cost. Using HFCs as blow-

"For blowing agents with significantly higher prices, such as HFCs, there is no obvious way to provide a competitive
insulation product in highly cost-sensitive markets other than reducing the amount of expensive blowing agent used
(e.g. by using a blend with hydrocarbon) or reducing overall foam density without affecting the product properties (e.g.
compressive strength). In practice, there is no easy route to lower-density products with the same performance levels.
However, co-blowing with CO, (water) has been an option for several HFC-based technologies, albeit with some upper
limits imposed by the performance requirements of the product.

"The blowing agent for thermal insulating foams is usually a significant contributor to thermal performance (Vo and
Paquet, 2004). A more expensive blowing agent can therefore be justified if the benefit in thermal resistance can offset
the additional cost. This has often been the case in traditional uses of CFCs. While more expensive than hydrocarbons
and other alternatives, they provided cost-effective insulation because thinner boards could be used. Although the thermal
performance of HCFC blown foams was initially slightly worse than their CFC blown equivalents (UNEP-FTOC, 1995)
system improvements soon restored parity after the transition from CFCs (UNEP-FTOC, 1999). However, this was in a
situation where HCFCs were trading at prices similar to traditional CFC levels.

can be substantial between different insulation materials.

"The choice of insulation type can be impacted by many factors, including long-term thermal performance, efficient utilisation
of space, cost and ease of installation. For most new buildings, a minimum energy performance is required for the building
fabric (usually stated in terms of U-value or R-value). All insulation types can normally meet this minimum standard, but

"Although work continues on the safe use of hydrocarbon systems in polyurethane (PU) spray foams, the current commercial
reality in Spain is that the only viable alternatives to HCFC-based systems for closed cell insulating foams are HFC-based.
This has resulted in the need for well-coordinated transition programmes, not all of which have proceeded smoothly. Spray
foam systems provide unique opportunities for the renovation of buildings, particularly roofs in both the residential and
commercial/industrial sectors. The building style in Spain and other Southern European countries lends itself to the use of
PU spray foam for upgrading the insulation of flat roofs. The key advantage is that there is no need to ‘tear off’ the existing
roof material prior to the application of spray foam. This has a critical impact in the installed cost of a re-insulated roof, as
shown in the table below:

"The budget set aside for the improvement of the building fabric (both residential and commercial/industrial) is € 2,780
million, although this will include the installation of new glazing and other fabric measures. This represents an average
investment allocation of just over € 30 per m2. If the roofs of 45,000 houses per year were re-insulated with PU spray foam,
the overall cost of the work, assuming an average roof size of 100m2, would be € 776 million (i.e. 28% of the total budget).
This seems a reasonable proportion of funds to be allocated for this purpose bearing in mind the resulting CO, saving.
However, if other insulation technologies were used as an alternative to PU spray foam, either the percentage of the total
budget allocated to roof renovation would need to be increased to more than 50% of the total budget, thereby forfeiting other
options, or the roofing area insulated per year would be less. The figure in this box illustrates the impact, given a constant
budget allocation (28%), on CO, savings in lifecycle terms of the application of the different technologies. The lifetime of
any roof renovation measure is assumed to be 15 years, given the durability of the waterproof membranes used, and it is the
same for all options.

plications, HFC use can have specific cost and environmental
benefits, even though the basic cost of the HFC and its global
warming potential would intuitively indicate otherwise. An ad-
ditional factor with a potentially significant effect on use pat-
terns is local regulation. However, one of the challenging as-
pects of determining the impact of such regulation is that most
potential legislation is still in the future and the full implica-
tions on HCFC substitution are still to emerge. Accordingly, in
the absence of detailed information, future regulatory impacts
cannot therefore be considered to be part of the BAU scenario.

One-component foams have been a particularly high-pro-
file use of HFCs (indeed, the primary use) in foams over re-
cent years. Since OCFs are totally emissive in their application,
the impact on short-term HFC emission assessments has been
profound. However, alternative technologies do exist and have
only been limited in their market penetration by initial safety
concerns. It seems fairly certain that HFC use in this sector will
be phased out within the next ten years, and the current draft EU
regulation on fluorinated gases reflects this reality. Accordingly,
this eventuality is included in the BAU case. Nonetheless, it is
worth noting in passing that the role of one-component foams
in improving the air tightness of buildings is possibly one of the
largest single potential contributors to overall energy efficiency
improvement.

"They can be summarized as follows:

¢ better thermal performance, leading to enhanced capabilities
in space-constrained environments;

* compliance with product fire classifications in applications
and regions sensitive to ‘reaction-to-fire’ issues;

* minimization of risks in processing, particularly when risks
cannot be specifically addressed by engineered solutions or
when costs are prohibitive (e.g. SMEs);

* cost-effective application options, particularly important in
the building renovation sector where costs may determine
whether insulation is applied at all.

(2) Drawbacks to using HFCs remain:

* concerns about the ability to demonstrate objectively the
environmental neutrality or benefit of using an HFC option,
particularly for building applications;

¢ stakeholder concern about the growth of HFC use;

* cost implications of using HFCs in highly competitive
markets where there is little, if any, return on the
investment.

(3) Once an HFC technology has been selected, there are sev-

eral strategies for minimizing emissions:

* optimization of the formulation to minimize HFC use (e.g.
by using co-blowing agents);

¢ design of the product for low blowing-agent losses during
the long use phase;

¢ design of the product for ease of processing at end of life

"An additional element of uncertainty is the split between
n-pentane, iso-pentane and cyclo-pentane usage in the hydro-
carbon-based sector of the market. Where specific regional in-

However, for the most part, assumptions have been made based
on practices in other regions or similar usage sectors. In any
event, the total hydrocarbon emissions and banks are unaf-
fected by this approach and the uncertainty has little impact on

In the foam sector, demand for HCFC-142b and HCFC-22
is significantly lower than demand for HCFC-141b. Global
demand for HCFC-142b was approximately 24,000 tonnes in
2001. That same year, global demand for HCFC-22 was approx-
imately 9,000 tonnes. The demand for HCFC-142b is primarily
based on the production of extruded-polystyrene foam in North
America and Japan. HCFC-22 is also used, to a lesser degree,
in polystyrene- and polyurethane-foam applications in North
America. With the exception of HCFC-22 in Latin America,
HCFC-142b and HCFC-22 consumption in developing coun-
tries is very low, although some use of HCFC-22 is occurring
as a blend with HCFC-141b in integral skin foams. Once these

At the Petten Conference (Ashford, 1999), it was estimated that
the global uptake of HFCs in foams would be around 75,000
tonnes by 2004, with further growth to 115,000 tonnes in 2010.
This was also reflected in emissions estimates for Europe at
that time of 13 Mtonnes CO,-eq (March, 1998). Since then,
however, it has become increasingly apparent that the cost of
the relevant HFCs has driven a high level of innovation for
alternatives and, in particular, blends which make best use of
HFC properties without being totally reliant upon them (e.g.
co-blowing with CO, (water) for spray foam applications in
the United States). The resulting estimate for 2010 is now ap-
proximately 57,000 tonnes, rising to just under 73,000 tonnes
by 2015, and the re-appraisal of European emissions to below
10 Mtonnes CO,-eq (Preamble to draft EU F-Gas Regulation,

"Ongoing HCFC usage in developed and developing countries
As a result of Montreal Protocol controls, the use of CFCs has
dropped from more than 75,000 ODP tonnes in 1995 to around
10,000 ODP tonnes in 2002. The use of CFC blowing agents
in developing countries is declining, but is likely to continue
until 2005-2008. According to the TEAP HCFC Task Force
Report (UNEP-TEAP, 2003), HCFCs are likely to play a con-
tinued role as ‘transitional substances’ in insulating and in inte-
gral skin foams. HCFC-141b is the most widely used blowing
agent in the foam sector, with global demand at approximately
110,000 tonnes in 2001. Because it is banned for use in foams or
scheduled for imminent phase-out in most developed countries,
HCFC-141b consumption will drop significantly to approxi-
mately 28,000 tonnes in 2003-2004. However, HCFC-141b
will still be considered a viable replacement for CFCs in devel-
oping countries and demand is expected to increase steadily to
approximately 40,000 tonnes by 2015.

One of the key factors in defining the business-as-usual
scenario related to the percentage of the phase-out of extruded
polystyrene in the US foam sector in 2010 that would be depen-
dent on the uptake of HFCs. This remains an extraordinarily
difficult parameter to predict and a reasonably conservative es-
timate of 65% has therefore been adopted.

The UNEP Foams Technical Options Committee (UNEP-
FTOC, 1999) and, more latterly, the Task Force on Collection,
Recovery and Long-term Storage (UNEP-TEAP, 2002ab) have
addressed the issue of release profiles from foams. These have
formed the basis for more recent modelling work (Ashford et
al., 2004ab). However, efforts continue to be made to update
specific emission functions where new evidence supports such
revision (see Table 7.7 for the latest emission functions). The
recent work of the extruded-polystyrene industry has been par-
ticularly noteworthy in this respect (Vo and Paquet, 2004; Lee
and Mutton, 2004). This assessment has re-evaluated emission
losses during the use phase of extruded polystyrene at 0.75%

Finally, the business-as-usual scenario needs to address
HFC demand assumptions beyond 2015 in order to establish
a complete picture of the likely emissions scenario over the
full lifecycle (up to 50 years) of foam products manufactured
and installed in the period through to 2015. Beyond 2015, it is
known that HCFC consumption in developing countries will
be frozen under the Montreal Protocol and will be phased out
by 2040. Accordingly, it is assumed that the decline is linear
between 2030 and 2040. For HFC use beyond 2015, there is
less certainty, but the degree of innovation that has marked the
last 20 years would suggest that the foam industry is unlikely to
be reliant on HFCs beyond 2030. Accordingly, the business-as-

"The development of interest in blowing-agent emissions from
the foam sector was initially driven from within the Montreal
Protocol process. Although this protocol operates in legal terms
on a ‘production/consumption’ basis, the parties have never
lost sight of the fact that three of the central clauses of the pre-
amble to the protocol refer explicitly to controlling emissions
(UNEP, 2003). Given this background, the parties have tended
to encourage the technical and economic review of methods for
reducing emissions from end uses involving ozone-depleting
substances. In two key areas — refrigeration and foams — these
opportunities are particularly significant because of the encap-
sulation and delayed release of the respective refrigerants and
blowing agents. In promoting the consideration of these op-
tions, the protocol has been very careful not to mandate such
emission reduction strategies, recognizing that these decisions
are for individual parties or r groups of parties.

"Some significant trends emerge. The increased CFC emis-
sions peak in the period between 2030 and 2050 reflects the im-
pact of decommissioning CFC-containing products from build-
ings. The business-as-usual scenario does not envisage any
recovery of the blowing agent from these sources. However,
the continuation of CFC emissions beyond 2050 illustrates that
considerable levels of CFCs are expected to be re-banked in
landfill sites (other end-of-life options include re-use, shredding
without blowing agent recovery and shredding with blowing
agent recovery). The assumption in the case of landfill is that
the initial losses from foams are not excessive. Work carried out
by the Danish Technical University on losses from refrigerator
foam during shredding and landfill suggests overall losses in the
range of 20% (Scheutz and Kjeldsen, 2001). At first sight, this
seems low. However, if one takes into consideration the fine-
celled structure of these foams and the fact that some blowing
agent is often dissolved in the matrix, it becomes more reason-
able to assume losses of this order for most landfill processes.
In cases where car shredders are used, there is a third potential
factor, since the foam particles generated through such shred-
ders tend to be ‘fist-sized’ and do not represent a substantial in-
crease in surface area to volume. This contrasts with European
and Japanese shredders, which are designed to maximize sur-
face area and encourage the release of blowing agent under
controlled conditions. The ‘fist-sized’ pieces are more likely
to mirror the type of debris obtained from building demolition
processes and it is for this reason that the parallel is drawn for
modeling purposes. The assumption, however, involves a high
level of sensitivity. Figure 7.4 illustrates this sensitivity by con-
sidering what the emissions forecast would look like if, in a

It remains difficult to evaluate the impact of such a mea-
sure in quantitative terms. It would reduce the impact of blow-
ing agents landfilled in the past or in the future. Since reliance
on landfill is falling in many parts of the world, this reduction
could be limited. While the current emission models used for
this report allow, for the first time, the quantification of the
banks that have already been landfilled (but not included in the
bank estimates quoted in this report), the degree of mitigation
that can be achieved will be dependent on the prevalence of ap-

reduction factor somewhere between a business-as-usual uncer-

since this approach generates breakdown products, including
HFCs (notably HFC-41), further work still remains to be done
in characterizing the potential consequential effects of the by-

The selection of specific HFCs can have some bearing on the
ultimate global warming impact of blowing-agent emissions.
However, in practice, the two competing HFC technologies in
most polyurethane applications are HFC-245fa (GWP 1020)°
and HFC-365mfc/HFC-227ea blends (with GWPs of 950-1100
depending on blend composition). Accordingly, the distinction
is minimal unless the formulations have significantly different
loadings of HFC. This can be the case for HFC-245fa, which
does have a higher blowing efficiency than HFC-365mfc/HFC-
227ea. However, the difference in boiling points and flamma-
bility may offset this. In practice, therefore, there is little to be
gained from switching HFCs to minimize impacts in the poly-
urethane sector.

With the possibility of HFC selection having only a super-

This subject was already covered in Sections 7.3.1 and 7.3.2

is currently based on a well-grounded rationale. However, past
experience shows that circumstances can change substantially
with time, and technology breakthroughs in the areas of poly-

"For gaseous HFCs such as HFC-134a (GWP 1410) and
HFC-152a (GWP 122), there would appear to be much more to
gain by switching from HFC-134a to HFC-152a. However, this
is far from being the case for two reasons. Both are related to
the fact that the rate of diffusion of HFC-152a from foam cells
is several times faster than that of HFC-134a. The implication
is that the emission of HFC-152a is faster and less controllable
than HFC-134a. This has the added implication that, where the
foam is being used as thermal insulation, there is less blowing
agent available to maintain that performance. Since long-term
thermal performance is a critical characteristic of all insulation,
the early loss of HFC-152a is a major drawback. As a result,
HEC-134a is preferred in most insulation foam formulations.
In practice (particularly in the case of extruded polystyrene),
blends of HFC-134a and HFC-152a are used to obtain the best
balance of properties.

Another example of process management is the minimiza-
tion of process waste. In the case of both phenolic and polyure-
thane block foams, there is an opportunity to recapture blow-
ing agent from off-cuts. These can be significant in the case of
fabricated pipe sections where block utilization rarely exceeds
55%. Similar waste minimization practices can also be encour-

buildings.

Conversely, as discussed earlier, measurements of effective
blowing-agent-diffusion coefficients for laboratory and field-
aged XPS samples by Vo and Paquet, and work by Lee and
Mutton on the average thickness and installed use temperature
of XPS boards, have given a better understanding of loss mech-
anisms and support a reduction of annual use-phase losses to
0.75% from the original TFCRS study value of 2.5% (UNEP-

Since considerable uncertainties about emission rates in use
exist and bearig in mind that general thicknesses of insulation
are likely to increase (lower surface to volume ratio), leading to
reductions in emission rates, it is naturally difficult, and perhaps
inappropriate, to postulate a fully defined emission reduction
scenario in this phase of the lifecycle. The reality is that the
losses in use (i.e. after the first year) are low as a proportion of
the total blowing-agent loading, and that changes in technology
are unlikely to have any major impact.

Process management measures include the improved encapsu-
lation of processing areas, particularly where unreacted chemi-
cal/blowing-agent mixtures are exposed at elevated ambient
temperatures. The ability to capture the volatile blowing agent
from the atmosphere will often depend on the amount of venti-
lation being used in the area (for safety and occupational health
reasons, this is often significant) and the size of the processing
area. The practicality and cost of such measures will vary sig-
nificantly from process to process. For instance, in spray foams,
there are few practical ways of recapturing blowing agent, al-
though careful design of spray heads can limit over-spray and
resulting blowing-agent loss.

In the extruded- polystyrene sector, process losses have also

been under scrutiny within the industry and there is some evi-
dence to suggest that losses in North America could already be
lower than in Europe because of the product mix and process
design. These differences have been documented earlier in a
US EPA Notice of Data Availability (US EPA, 2001). The im-
plication is that production losses could be as low as 10% in
some scenarios. With current ranges being 15-25% for Europe
and 10-25% for North America, the figure of 17.5% for North
America and 20% for the rest of the world could justifiably
be adopted in future as an alternative to the current default of
25% (Lee and Mutton, 2004). Nevertheless, a technical break-
through is needed to handle the high-volume air flows and the
very dilute blowing-agent concentrations generated from trim
reprocessing (Cheminfo Services Inc., 2001) if major savings
are going to be made in process emissions.

The implementation of Article 16 of Regulation 2037/2000
in the European Union has increased the flow of information
about the effectiveness of recovery of blowing agents from
refrigerators (OJ, 2000). This information had already been
established in several Member States and built into relevant
standards (RAL GZ728, 2001; Draft DIN-8975-12, 2002).
However, these standards were based on minimum recovery
rates of approximately 70% of initial charge, implying consid-
erably greater loss in the use phase than the assumptions used in
the emissions models developed by the TEAP and others. This
potentially higher loss rate has been supported by subsequent
work by the Centre for Energy Studies in Paris (Zoughaib et al.,
2003). There is a case, therefore, for increasing the annual loss
assumptions in the use phase from the 0.25% used in the TFCRS
study (UNEP-TEAP, 2002ab) to 0.5% or 0.75%. The difference
with use-phase losses for commercial refrigeration or other in-
sulated panels could be rationally ascribed to the presence of
a thermoplastic liner. However, it has been decided to wait for
further investigation of aged refrigerators before adopting this
change.

authors as ‘illustrative, rather than definitive’, suggest costs in
the order of $18—20 per tonne of CO,-eq for automated process-
es and $48 per tonne of CO,-eq for manually dismantled units
with foam incineration. Anecdotal information from Europe
suggests that ozone-depleting substances are currently being
recovered at a price of around $40/kg. If transferred to HFC
blowing agents, this would equate to an emission abatement
cost of somewhere below $40 per tonne of CO,-eq, depending
on the profit margins applied. This would be considerably lower
again for CFCs where GWPs are higher.

Both March (1998) and Ecofys (Harnisch and Hendriks
(2000)) gave particularly low estimates of abatement costs for
measures for extruded polystyrene; both were in the range of
$6-12 per tonne of CO,-eq on the basis of transitions to CO,
blowing options with investment amortization over a fifteen-
year period. However, it should be noted that a transition to
CO,-based technologies is not currently possible for smaller
producers and other regional markets (e.g. North America).
The more recent IMAC Report (US EPA, 2004) has reassessed
this option on a global basis and states an even lower estimate
for the cost of transition. However, industry sources have been
quick to point out that all of the emissions models used for these
costing exercises have:

"There have been few systematic reviews of abatement costs
for the foam sector. The March Consulting Group (1998) re-
viewed potential emissions and abatement options for HFCs in
the European Union. However, this review only included the
costs of the options identified at that time for the reduction of
potential extruded-polystyrene emissions. Ecofys picked up the
agenda in the EU Sectoral Objectives Report (Harnisch and
Hendriks, 2000) and conducted a more systematic review of
abatement costs for both the extruded-polystyrene and polyure-
thane sectors. However, there were several drawbacks to this
study. First of all, it was written before the transition to HFC
blowing agents had taken place in Europe and before many of
the technology choices had been finalized. As a consequence, it
considerably over-estimated the uptake and consequent emis-
sions of HFCs in the region. Secondly, it was only tasked to
look at emission-abatement options that would be effective
by 2010. This immediately ruled out the costing of end-of-life
management options and forced the focus onto HFC-substitu-
tion technologies.

The CFC transition under the Montreal Protocol is still in

are being replaced by both HFC MDIs and DPIs. The main
impact on GWP is made by the transition from CFC to HFC
MDIs. Recently, a number of new drugs have been launched

When the MDI was introduced in the mid-1950s, CFCs
were used as propellants and these have been replaced in recent
years with HFCs, although the complete phase-out of CFCs in
MDIs is not expected to be before 2010. CFCs and HFCs are
used in MDIs because of their chemical and physical properties
and no other propellants have been developed to date that might
constitute alternatives. Multidose DPIs, which do not require a
propellant, have also become more widely available in the past
decade as a not-in-kind replacement and this has mitigated the
growth of the use of MDIs.

MDIs remain the dominant form of treatment for asthma
and COPD worldwide in terms of units prescribed. In devel-
oped countries, the proportion of MDI to DPI varies substan-
tially from country to country: from 9:1 MDI:DPI in the USA
to 7:3 in UK and 2:8 in Sweden. The variation is accounted for
by a number of factors, including availability (e.g. multidose
DPIs only recently became available in the USA; by contrast,
there is a local manufacturer and a long tradition of DPI use in
Sweden), patient and physician choice, and relative cost. CFC
MDIs are being phased out, and being replaced by HFC MDIs
and DPIs. The use of DPIs in developing countries is negligible.
Both MDIs and DPIs play an important role in the treatment
of asthma/COPD and no single delivery system is universally
acceptable for all patients. It is critical to maintain the range of

therapeutic options.

which coughing and wheezing develop and the airways narrow,

spontaneously or be triggered by many environmental factors
or viral infections. Attacks of asthma may require urgent ad-
ditional medication, they sometimes require hospitalization and
they are occasionally fatal.

COPD is a condition involving the narrowing and inflammation
of the airways in conjunction with damage to the lung tissue
(emphysema). COPD is caused primarily by cigarette smoking,
with inhalation of occupational dusts or environmental air pol-
lution as potential co-factors. COPD is persistent and progres-
sive if the patient continues to smoke, and further deterioration
can still occur even after smoking cessation. COPD ultimately
leads to permanent disability and death. Acute exacerbations of
COPD frequently require hospitalization.

In the 1996 Global Burden of Disease Study sponsored by
the World Health Organization, COPD was ranked 12 in terms
of disability, but is projected to rank 5 in 2020, behind isch-
aemic heart disease, major depression, traffic accidents and
cerebrovascular disease. In 1998, COPD was the fourth most
common cause of death in the United States after heart disease,
cancer and stroke. In most developed countries, the male death
rate from COPD has been declining. By contrast, the female
mortality rate is increasing and it is expected that mortality
rates amongst females will overtake those men by about 2005.

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
are the most common chronic diseases of the air passages (air-
ways or bronchi) of the lung and are thought to affect over 300
million people worldwide. These illnesses account for high
health-care expenditure, cause significant absence from work
and school, and premature death. Modern treatment for these
conditions involves the inhalation of aerosol medication with a
specific particle size (1-5 micron), which is deposited into the
airways of the lung (bronchi). This allows maximal local effect
in the airways where it is needed and minimizes the side-effects
of the drug elsewhere in the body.

Asthma most often starts in childhood, and persists into
adult life, causing frequent attacks, chronic ill health and inca-
pacity. A recent international study of asthma in childhood has
shown a prevalence of asthma that varies from approximately 1
percent in some countries such as Indonesia to over 30 percent
in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Australia ISAAC-
SC, 1998). It is more common in affluent countries, but has
been increasing rapidly in developing countries over the last
two decades. This increasing prevalence is likely to be due to
multiple factors including ‘westernization’, changes in house
design, greater exposure to house dust mite, maternal smoking,
diet, air pollution and/or tobacco smoking.

aerosol delivery with inhalation is not as critical as for MDIs or

Nebulizer systems typically fall into the categories of air jet

or ultrasonic depending on the physical principle used for aero-
sol droplet generation. Jet nebulizers draw solution through a
capillary tube using the Bernoulli effect and disperse droplets in
air at high velocity. Ultrasonic nebulizers use high-energy ultra-
sonic vibration to create droplets suitable for inhalation. Until
very recently, nebulizer use was limited to the hospital or home
due to the energy requirements and poor portability of conven-
tional systems. In general, the performance of nebulizers tends
to vary significantly depending on the type and formulation.

"Nebulizers for the delivery of solutions of drugs were in ex-

found their application in acute ambulatory care and domicili-

the lungs of the patients and did not require a degree of co-
ordination to deliver the drug effectively (Dalby et al., 1996).
Nebulizers continue to play a valuable role in severely compro-

"There are two types of MDI formulations: suspension for-

solution formulations, in which the drug freely dissolves in
either the propellant or a combination of propellant and an ac-

1995). Both types of formulation have inherent advantages and
disadvantages. Traditionally, suspension formulations have
been the more common dosage form, but with the advent of the
hydrofluoroalkane propellants (HFC-134a; HFC-227ea), which
have poor solvency characteristics, the use of co-solvents has
become more common and solution formulations being used

Most DPI formulations are sensitive to moisture during pro-

presence of moisture in the ultimate product has been shown to
reduce the de-aggregation of the powder, thereby decreasing
the fine particle fraction of the aerosol (Boekestein et al., 2002;
Staniforth, 2002). One approach proposes the use of magne-
sium stearate as a lubricant and anti-caking agent to maintain

The powder formulation is a critical component of a DPI.
Several key attributes are necessary for successful respiratory
drug delivery. First, the active drug must be produced in the
appropriate particle size range of 1-5 microns (Schuster et al.,
1998), whether these fine particles are delivered as pure drug or
as a formulation with acceptable excipients. Second, the drug
particles must be chemically and physically stable following
their manufacture, storage, and subsequent processing when
preparing the final drug product.

Sensitivity of asthmatics to excipients must be considered
when developing new products. For example, a metaproterenol
MDI product reformulated with a new surfactant was withdrawn
shortly after launch due to escalating reports of coughing, gag-
ging, and asthma exacerbation (Poochikian and Bertha, 2000).
A powder’s sensitivity to moisture can also be overcome by
designing and manufacturing packages (multi- or single-dose)
with a proper moisture barrier. Exploiting advances in packag-
ing technology can improve inhalation powder stability while
avoiding the risk of new excipients.

Powders of respirable size tend to have poor flow character-
istics due to adhesive interparticle forces. To facilitate powder
filling and dispersion, the drug particles can be formulated with
additional excipients, usually lactose. Regardless of the compo-
sition, regulatory requirements mean that the final powder for-
mulation must provide a stable and reproducible aerosol. This
is mainly assessed by the total emitted dose and fine particle
fraction (Hickey, 1992; US FDA, 1998). DPIs may be less suit-
able for some patients with low inspiratory flow rates, such as
the elderly and young children.

Once suitable non-CFC propellants had been identified, the
MDI industry undertook to reformulate the CFC MDIs so that
they could use HFCs. The components and formulations had
to be substantially modified to use the new HFC propellants.
As drug products, MDIs are subject to extensive regulation by
national health authorities to ensure product safety, product ef-
ficacy and manufacturing quality. The process for developing
CFC-free MDIs was therefore essentially the same as the de-
velopment of a wholly new drug product, involving full clinical
trials for each reformulated MDI. Research and development
for a new product is a lengthy, challenging, and resource-in-

meet several additional strict criteria relating to safety and ef-

(iv) chemically stable, (v) acceptable to patients (in terms of
taste and smell), (vi) appropriate solvency characteristics, and
(vii) appropriate density (Tansey, 1997; Smith, 1995). It was
extremely difficult to identify compounds fulfilling all of these
criteria and in the end only two hydrofluorocarbons — HFC-
134a and HFC-227ea — emerged as viable alternatives to CFCs.
Two international consortia (IPACT-I and IPACT-II) were then
established to conduct thorough toxicological testing and en-

important to ensure a smooth transition from CFCs to HFCs.

More sophisticated nebulizers (Smart, 2002) or effort-as-

DPIs in use at present and there will therefore be an increased
cost penalty compared to MDIs (Dalby, 2003). However, if they
provide more effective delivery of the drug, treatment costs
may be reduced. By contrast, some less complex DPIs currently

Suman, 2003; Yellan, 2003). However, quantitative data are
more limited. The UK is a good model for MDI/DPI usage
since it is a market with high MDI use and a history of DPI

In a wider study, which included a comparison of costs across

Therapeutic decisions, including the choice of delivery system,

patterns. Each of the existing inhalation delivery systems has
an important role in the treatment of respiratory illnesses and no
single delivery system is universally acceptable for all patients.
DPIs do provide an alternative for patients with asthma/COPD,

"It is always challenging to project market dynamics in areas
like pharmaceutical use, where commercial and regulatory
pressures have such a major impact. It is anticipated that global
market growth in inhaled medicine in the coming decade will
be approximately 7% (Enviros March, 2000) whereas growth
in MDIs is lower at between 1.5 and 3%. Also, provided that
the MDI transition in developing and industrialized countries

Market growth will be 7% per annum and MDI growth
within this will range from between 1.5 and 3%. The total
number of MDI units will be 680 million in 2015.
Salbutamol MDIs will still represent approximately 50% of
the overall MDI market.

Two HFCs will continue to be used in MDIs for asthma/
COPD. These will be HFC-134a and HFC-227ea, in an ap-
proximate ratio of 90:10.

Alternatively, using the same set of assumptions, one can
evaluate the change for a single canister of salbutamol and
project the cost using a similar approach. In this case, for each
salbutamol MDI, the amount of propellant in an individual can-
ister is approximately 13.2 grammes of HFC-134a. As 134a has
a GWP of 1300, the CO, equivalent of an individual HFC-134a
MDI is 0.01716 tonnes (13.2 x 1300 / 1,000,000). With an in-
cremental cost for each salbutamol inhaler converted from HFC
MDI to DPI of USS 5, this is equivalent to a mitigation cost of
US$ 5/0.01716 tonnes or approximately 292 US$ACO,: -eq.

"MDIs are the dominant form of treatment for asthma and
COPD worldwide. In developed countries, the proportion of
MDI to DPI varies substantially from country to country: from
9:1 MDI:DPI in the USA to 7:3 in UK and 2:8 in Sweden This
is linked to a number of factors, including availability (e.g. mul-
tidose DPIs only recently became available in the USA), patient
and physician choice, and relative cost. CFC MDIs are being
phased out and replaced by HFC MDIs, and increasingly by
DPIs. The transition has proceeded slowly as alternatives be-
come available and countries accept the overall increased cost,
balancing the environmental benefits against the availability
of affordable medications to patients. A transition to another
new form of treatment could be both costly and time-consum-
ing, without clinical benefits for patients. Whilst the propor-
tion of HFC MDIs to DPIs is likely to decrease slowly because
of availability, cost and patient choice, both forms of inhaled
therapy will continue to o be available.

"In developing countries, inhaled therapy is mainly with sal-
butamol/albuterol, almost exclusively with pressurized MDIs
from either multinationals or local manufacturers. CFCs are
due to be phased out completely by 2010, and this is a major
challenge for developing countries. The rates of both asthma
and COPD are rising in these countries, and statistical data
probably underestimate disease prevalence. Guidelines rec-
ommending the replacement of old and ineffective oral treat-
ments with inhaled therapy are gaining increasing acceptance.
Improved economic circumstances are likely to result in a sub-
stantial increase in the use of inhaled therapy. One company in
India is locally producing and marketing a range of HFC MDIs.
Affordable single dose DPIs are technically feasible and could
be locally manufactured in developing countries. There would
be significant pharmaceutical difficulties in hot and humid cli-
mates (Maggi et. al., 1999), and DPIs would still be more ex-
pensive than MDIs on a cost per dose basis. If these became
available and achieved a significant market share, they would
reduce the future volumes of HFC needed for MDIs. Multidose
DPlIs from multinational companies are either unavailable or
too expensive for many patients. MDIs are likely to remain the
most affordable and acceptable form of inhaled therapy in the
long term in developing countries. For all the above reasons,
predictions of HFC needs for inhaled therapy in developing
countries are uncertain.

Most reduction of GWP from MDIs will be achieved through
the completion of the transition from CFC to HFC MDIs.

No major breakthroughs for inhaled drug delivery are an-

technologies and the development time scales involved.

The health and safety of the patient is of paramount impor-

* This projection was developed by IPAC in 1999 and is

primarily based upon a survey of IPAC member companies
(including 3M) for 1998 data. The data were most reliable
for IPAC companies’ major markets (e.g. Europe and

North America). The projections include an estimate for
non-IPAC companies and the developing world. The range
reflects assumed MDI market growth rates of 1.5% to 3.0%.

In response to the request from the authors of the MDI chapter
of the IPCC Special Report, IPAC recently reviewed its
emissions projections and analyzed more recent data and
information available since 1999. The range above is primarily
based upon TEAP figures for the volume of CFCs used in the
production of MDIs for 2001 and IPAC data on HFCs collected
for 2001.
This range is somewhat higher than IPAC’s original estimate
given above. This is probably due to the fact that IPAC’s 1999
estimate was based on hard data only from IPAC member
companies. The 2001 TEAP figures are presumably more
accurate for volumes used in the developing world and non-IPAC
MDI companies.
IPAC’s 2010 projections are also consistent with the 2010
emissions projection estimated by Enviros March (2000) in its
December 2000 report, submitted to the European Climate
Change Programme: 10,230 metric tonnes.

12,865 to 14,915 metric tonnes of HFCs

The most recent estimate from the Halons Technical
Options Committee (HTOC) of the size of the existing halon
bank and annual emission rates (2002) is 42,000 tonnes with
2,100 tonnes of emissions for halon 1301, and 125,000 tonnes
with 17,000 tonnes of emissions for halon 1211 (HTOC, 2003).
Atmospheric measurements in 2002 for halon 1301 suggest
emissions of 1000-2000 tonnes and emissions of 7,000-8,000
tonnes for halon 1211. Halon 2402 was used mainly in the for-

The environmental goal of ozone protection is being achieved
with a growing base of newly installed systems which now use
halon alternatives. Seventy-five percent of the applications that
originally used halons have shifted to agents with no climate
impact. Four percent of the original halon applications continue
to employ halons. The remaining 21% have shifted to HFCs
and a small number of applications have shifted to PFCs and
HCFCs. While this is a significant achievement, it is tempered
by the reality that there remains a large base of installed halon

Before the Montreal Protocol, HFCs, PFCs and HCFCs were
not used in fire protection. Their current, and growing, usage
is a direct result of their adoption as halon alternatives, despite
being inferior to halons both in terms of cost and performance.
Because fire protection is regulated in most countries, only those
agents meeting minimum acceptable fire extinguishment and
life-safety performance levels have been certified. About half
of former halon users are now choosing to protect new installa-
tions with zero-ODP gaseous (in-kind) clean agents. Some have
no significant effect on the climate system, while others have
substantial GWPs. The other half are choosing non-gaseous
(not-in-kind) agents, such as water, water mist, dry chemical,
foam and aerosols, all of which produce no direct greenhouse-
gas emissions. There are a small number of users that have ad-
opted HCFC-123, HCFC-22 and HCFC-124 agent blends.

In fixed systems where a clean agent is necessary, the alter-
natives currently available are carbon dioxide (lethal at con-
centrations that extinguish fires) and inert gases, HFCs, PFCs,
HCFCs and more recently, a fluoroketone! (FK). Carbon-diox-
ide and inert-gas systems account for approximately half of the
new clean-agent systems, with HFCs, PFCs, HCFCs and FK
accounting for the other half. HFCs are playing an important
role in the transition away from halon where the unique proper-
ties of this type of agent are required to achieve safe, fast fire
extinguishing without causing residual damage. PFCs played
an early role but current use is limited to the replenishment of
previously installed systems. The current fixed system bank of
HFCs, PFCs, HCFCs and FK was estimated to be 27,000 tonnes
at the end of 2004 with 1.4 MtCO,-eq of emissions at a 2%

increase, probably in the same proportion as for new systems.
In addition, clean-agent demand will be influenced by exist-
ing and future regulation. As research into new fire protection
technologies continues, additional options will likely emerge.
However, due to the lengthy process of testing, approval and
market acceptance of new fire protection equipment types and
agents, no additional options are likely to be available in time
to have appreciable impact by 2015.

Since the Montreal Protocol, the fire protection commu-
nity has become much more active in managing emissions.
Industry practices of capturing, recycling and reusing halons
have carried over to all high-value gaseous agents, including
HFCs, HCFCs and PFCs. There is no reason to believe they
will not also apply to any additional agents entering the market.
Because of their more complex chemistries, halon replacements
are unlikely to ever be as inexpensive as halons. As a result,
there is both a market incentive as well as an industry culture
that encourage the capture, recycling and reuse of fire-fighting
agents. Adhering to these practices, including certification pro-
grammes, has been shown to minimize emissions and to limit
the use of these agents to applications where their cleanliness is
needed. In countries where high levels of regulation exist, the
emission rates have been estimated at 1% or less; the figure is
2% where levels of regulation are average and approaches 3%
where there is less regulation. Portable extinguishers have an
emission rate of approximately 4%.

1. In some jurisdictions HFC-125 is not allowed for use in occupied spaces while in other jurisdictions that use is permitted under certain conditions.

2. Due to the short atmospheric lifetime, no GWP can be given. It is expected to be negligible for all practical purposes (Taniguchi ef a/., 2003). See Section
2.5.3.3 ‘Very short-lived hydrocarbons’ for additional information.

3. HFC-23 is effective at low temperatures (cold climates) and in large volumes due to its high vapour pressure.

4. HFC-227ea is effective in shipboard and vehicle applications due to extensive large-scale testing that has established the use parameters and demonstrated it
specialized capabilities in these applications.

5. HFC-125 is effective in vehicle and aircraft engine applications as a result of extensive large-scale testing that has established the use parameters and demor
strated its specialized capabilities in these applications.

6. FK-5-1-12 is in the early stages of its product life cycle and has yet to be tested for special applications beyond those achieved through the conventional ap-
proval testing of the requirements in ISO and NFPA type standards.

distinctly separate sub-sectors: portable extinguishers and fixed
systems. Halon 1301 (ODP = 10, Montreal Protocol value)
dominated the market for fixed gaseous systems while halon
1211 (ODP = 3) dominated the market for gaseous portable ex-

halons and was used only in a small number of countries.

"Halons are halogenated hydrocarbons that contain bromine
and exhibit exceptional fire-fighting effectiveness. They are
known as “clean agents” because they are volatile liquids or
gases, electrically non-conductive and leave no residue. As
gases, when dispensed in air, they can extinguish hidden fires
and those with complex geometries (three-dimensional fires).
At least one halon (1301) is safe for human exposure at concen-
trations that will extinguish fires. In short, they are easy to use,
versatile and i inexpensive.

"Any fire protection system or extinguisher must be available for
discharge at the moment a fire event occurs. Fixed systems and
extinguishers should therefore be designed, produced and main-
tained in a manner that eliminates loss of agent through leakage
and, in the case of fixed systems, inadvertent or unwanted dis-
charges. As a result, fire protection codes and standards estab-
lish minimum levels of design, require periodic maintenance,
and require regulatory authorities to adhere to these minimum
levels (NFPA, 2000, 2004).

"Atmospheric measurements in 2002 place emissions of ha-
lon 1301 between 1,000 and 2,000 tonnes. This is close to the
HTOC estimates. Atmospheric measurements for halon 1211,
however, are between 7,000 and 8,000 tonnes in 2002, consid-
erably lower than estimated by the HTOC. It appears that re-
cent actions by several parties may result in significant future
adjustments to the estimated quantities and to the geographical
distribution of halons. However, the HTOC estimate of future
emissions is currently the best available in the literature.

The most recent estimate of the Halons Technical Options

bank of 39,000 tonnes with 1,900 tonnes of emissions in 2005,
a bank of 31,000 tonnes with 1,500 tonnes of emissions in 2010

After their introduction in the early 1960s, the use of halons
grew steadily worldwide until the Montreal Protocol required
an end to their production by 1/1/94 in developed countries.
Global production of halon 1211 and 1301 peaked in 1988 at
43,000 and 13,000 tonnes respectively (HTOC, 1991). In de-
veloping countries halon 1211 production began in the 1980s,
and showed a growth curve similar to developed countries un-
til Multilateral Fund projects began to reverse that trend in the
1990s (HTOC, 2003). A third halon, 2402, was mainly used in
the former Soviet Union. No information on emissions or bank
size was found in the literature.

Halons’ unique combination of properties led to their selec-
tion for many fire protection situations: computer, communi-
cations and electronic equipment facilities; museums; engine
spaces on ships and aircraft; ground protection of aircraft; flam-
mable liquid storage and processing facilities, general office fire
protection and industrial applications (HTOC, 1989). Wickham
(2002), however, finds that the halocarbon alternatives are not
in such general use now. In part, their high cost appears to be
limiting their use to applications where a clean agent is a neces-
sity. The development and use of halon alternatives are driven
entirely by the Montreal Protocol. None of the available alter-
natives offer performance or cost advantages over halons.

Verdonik (2004) used these UK and US emissions data
and other publicly available data to update the Fire Protection
Emissions Model developed under the Greenhouse Gases
Emission Estimating Consortium. Estimates of emissions of
HFCs and PFCs from fire protection applications and the fixed-
system bank of HFCs and PFCs were developed using the 1
to 3% emission rate range developed by Verdonik and Robin
(2004). The results are provided in Table 9.3 where the compos-
ite gas is defined as consisting of 97.5% HFC-227ea and 2.5%
HFC-23. As fixed PFC systems are no longer installed, only a
small difference results when PFC is included in the calcula-
tion. Information provided by a producer of HCFCs for fixed
systems places the bank in 2002 at 3,400 and in 2004-2015
at 3,600 tonnes with annual emissions of 0.09 MtCO,-eq. The
fixed-system bank of HCFCs is assumed to be 85% HCFC-22,
10% HCFC- 124 and 5% HCFC- 123.

"Since the Montreal Protocol, the fire protection community
has become much more active in managing emissions. For ex-
ample, the highly emissive equipment testing and personnel
training practices were eliminated (HTOC, 1991, 1994) and as
a result emissions have decreased significantly. Until 2003, the
only estimates of emission rates for halons and their alterna-
tives were based on expert opinion. The 1996 IPCC Revised
Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories recom-
mended using the estimates for halons developed by McCulloch
(1992) to estimate HFC and PFC emissions (IPCC, 1997). In
Volume 3, however, it is also noted that the emissions of HFCs
and PFCs could be reduced by more than 50% in recognition
of the changes being implemented by the fire protection com-
munity. The HTOC (1997) also estimated that these new pro-
cedures reduced the non-fire emissions of halons by up to 90%.
Ball (1999) reported that many of the procedures originally
developed for halons are now being applied to alternatives, re-
ducing emissions far below pre-Montreal Protocol levels. Ball
opined that emissions for HFCs and PFCs could be as low as
1% of in-use quantities. On the basis of consultation with in-
dustry, a study prepared for the United Kingdom Department of
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (UK DEFRA) estimated
current annual HFC emissions at approximately 5% of the in-
stalled base per annum (AEAT, 2003).

"92.1.1 Agents existing at the time of the Montreal Protocol
In its 1989 report, HTOC discussed a technique called the se-
lection matrix. Basically, it places a value on performance pa-
rameters for several fire extinguishing system types, helping end
users and authorities select the most appropriate alternative for
a given application. The parameters in the matrix are: (1) low
space and weight (of the agent storage containers), (2) damage
limiting (speed of extinguishment and no agent residue), (3) abil-
ity to permeate (works around obstructions), (4) occupant risk
(safe at concentrations used), (5) flammable liquid extinguishing
capability, (6) system efficacy, (7) energized electrical equipment

capability (electrically non-conductive) and (8) installed cost.

"Water-based systems include automatic, fast response and pre-
action water sprinklers, deluge water spray and water mist. In
some applications, additives protect against freezing. Water-
based systems have a limited ability to permeate obstructions,
poor flammable liquid extinguishing capability and use
limitations around energized electrical equipment (HTOC,
1989). Water itself may damage the items to be protected, i.e.
it is not a clean agent. By contrast with gaseous agents, there is
also an agent residue after the systems discharge. Water mist
technology has achieved limited market acceptance, primarily
in turbine and diesel-powered machinery and, somewhat less
frequently, machinery spaces aboard ships. Water mist faces
two obstacles (Wickham, 2002). First, the systems are not good
at extinguishing small fires in large volumes, even to the point
of failing to extinguish them. Second, applications are limited
(in size and characteristics) to those where fire test protocols
have been developed in which system performance has been
determined empirically. This drives up costs higher than for
other technologies.

early development of standards and the willingness of end us-

instances, the suitability of an agent is determined through data
submittals, reviews and often testing involving the following:
national health authorities to approve safe usage levels, national
environmental authorities to assure compliance with laws and
treaties, national and international standard-making organiza-
tions to write rules for safe use, national testing laboratories
to test the chemicals, national testing laboratories to test and
approve agent systems, national and international certification

"Users almost always purchase hand portable fire extinguishers

occupancy, fire codes and regulations describe the hand por-
table fire extinguisher requirements in terms of (1) either the
charged weight or fire test rating of the extinguisher and (2)
the number of extinguishers required based on the floor area
of the facility and the maximum travel distance to an extin-
guisher. Furthermore, most codes require extinguishers capable
of extinguishing fires in Class A and B fuels, often with the
additional requirement that the extinguisher can be used safely
around energized electrical equipment (NFPA, 1998 and UL,
2000). Extinguishers suitable for Class A fuels are tested by ap-
proval laboratories on wood cribs, wood panels and excelsior
material. Extinguishers suitable for Class B fuels are tested by
approval laboratories on flammable liquids in metal pans. The
code requirements can be met either by employing an extin-

"other sectors, the amount of energy required to operate fire
protection systems is trivial and largely unaffected by the
agent used. This includes the impact of heating and cool-
ing the systems installed in buildings, as this is quite small
compared to the direct effect of an annual emission rate of
even 1%. Techniques such as TEWI and LCCP identify only
negligible levels of change compared to evaluations based
only on the GWPs of the agents. The notable exception is
aviation. The added weight of any of the halon alternatives
has an indirect emissions effect because of the additional
fuel use during the life of an aircraft.

¢ Speed of suppression: The discharge time for inert gas
systems is in the order of 60 seconds or more. This is sig-
nificantly longer than the discharge time of 10 seconds for
halocarbon systems. Inert gas systems are therefore not rec-
ommended for areas where a rapidly developing fire can be
expected (Kucnerowicz-Polak, 2002).

¢ Demonstrated special capabilities: There can be other per-
formance requirements that apply to specific applications for
which alternatives may not have been tested. For example,
Catchpole (1999) described the unique capabilities of HFC-
23 for deployment in high bay areas and in low ambient
temperature conditions. Wickham (2002) described mul-
tiple special applications for HFC-227ea in military ship-
board and vehicle applications and the choice of HFC-125
for both military vehicle and high-performance aircraft en-
gine protection. The comprehensive testing and evaluation
of HFC-23, HFC-227ea and HFC-125 for these applications
and others are well documented in the publications of the
US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST,
2003). FK-5-1-12 became commercially available in 2002
but has not yet been tested for some special applications. It
has satisfied regulatory review under US EPA SNAP, NFPA
and VdS, (VdS Schadenverhiitung GmbH) and is pending
at ISO. Market acceptance will depend on the comparative
cost of the competing options. No estimates are available
about how further restrictions on ozone-depleting substanc-
es and greenhouse-gases would affect agent choice in the
future.

¢ Multiple supply sources: HFC-23, HFC-125 and HFC-227ea
are manufactured by several companies in the US, Europe
and Asia, and inert gas agents and systems are available
worldwide from several competitive sources. FK-5-1-12 is
available from one manufacturer in the US. Fixed systems
utilizing these agents are available from several manufac-

History has shown that a large portion of the market place
was willing to pay over seven times more to get a clean-agent
halon 1211 unit rather a not very clean dry-chemical extin-
guisher (US$ 223/30=7.43). The current cost multiple of 13 to

HFC-236fa unit for US$ 493, the 15.5-pound HCFC Blend B

2.5 US gallon water extinguisher with a combined average end-

"The UK and US agreements, and HTOC Technical Note #2, all
make reference to the specific codes and standards that need to
be followed in carrying out these provisions. Many, but not all,
of these codes and standards have been discussed earlier in this
chapter and have been an integral part of successful national
programmes for reducing non-fire emissions. The specific codes
or standards are different in the UK and US agreements, but
their use was key to the success of both countries’ programmes.
The reader is encouraged to review the cited references to gain
a better understanding of the types of codes and standards avail-
able, how they were applied and how their use produced emis-
sions reductions.

"The significantly reduced emission rates were achieved through
a variety of actions within the fire protection community. For
example, both the United Kingdom and the United States have
developed voluntary agreements between the government and
the fire protection industry that include specific actions by the
fire protection community and also include the specific codes
and standards that must be followed (DETR and FIC, 1997;
FEMA et al., 2002). While the specific form of implementa-
tion will differ according to the country or region depending on
culture and legal traditions, the technical practices needed to
minimize emissions will be the same. An explanation of these
kinds of practices may be found in the agreements themselves
and in the HTOC Technical Note #2 (1997), which also include
important provisions for stored and stockpiled halons.

Fixed systems protect specific volumes (rooms), often tele-
communications suites. Over the typical system life of 15 to
20 years, the protected equipment may change many times,
with the fire protection system remaining in place. In special-
ized applications, such as aircraft and military systems, systems
can remain in use for 25 to 35 years or longer (HTOC, 1994).
Similarly, portable extinguishers meet a particular fire code or
level of safety and are not replaced unless the use of the space
changes in a way that requires a different fire protection capa-
bility. Portable extinguishers are generally required to undergo
periodic pressure testing that involves removing the agent from
the cylinder (NFPA 10), which is then recycled and redeployed.
Estimates of the useful lifetime of portable extinguishers are
between five to 25 years, depending upon regional factors

In countries or regions that have also placed export restric-
tions on the stores of halon, the only solution proposed has been
destruction, often through a plasma arc or incineration process.
To date, there has been only one known potentially economical-
ly feasible process described in the literature to convert either
halons or the halocarbon alternatives to other useful products
(Uddin et al., 2004).

To date, there are no fire-protection-specific proposals in
the literature for managing the end of life of halocarbon agents
other than halons (HTOC, 2002, page 6). However, the industry
practices of capturing, recycling and reusing halons have carried
over to all high value gaseous agents, including HFCs, HCFCs
and PFCs. There is no reason to believe they will not also be ap-
plied to FK agents as they enter the market. In addition, because
of their more complex chemistries, it appears unlikely that ha-
lon replacements will ever be as inexpensive as halons. As a re-
sult, there is both a market incentive as well as an industry cul-
ture favouring capture, recycle and reuse. Adherence to these
practices, including certification programmes, has been shown
to minimize emissions and to limit the use of these agents to
applications where their cleanliness is needed.

The current availability of halons is the direct result of a
strategy to recycle, effectively manage, and allow trade of the
existing supplies of halons. The objectives were twofold: to en-
able a production phase-out in advance of alternatives to impor-
tant national security and public safety applications, and to pre-
clude the need for any future new production and consumption.
The current global trade in halons produced before the phase-
out is neither accidental nor a situation arising from oversupply.
No exemptions to the halon production and consumption phase-
out have been requested, or are expected to be granted by the
parties (HTOC, 1994). Halon’s positive market value provides
a financial incentive to minimize emissions. Alternatively, be-
cause halon released to the atmosphere is untraceable, policies
that diminish halon’s value or make ownership a liability could
result in increased emissions (UNEP-TEAP, 1998).

The in-kind substitutes for CFC-113 and CFC-11 are fluo-
rinated alternatives such as hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC-
141b and HCFC-225ca/cb), perfluorocarbons (primarily C,F,,),
hydrofluorocarbons (HFC-43-10mee, HFC-365mfe and HFC-
245fa, HFC-c447ef) and hydrofluoroethers (HFE-449s1, HFE-

ternatives, and so they are primarily used in applications where
safety, performance (such as compatibility, selective solvency
and stability) or other environmental considerations are crucial.
In most of the cleaning applications, the fluorinated solvents
are used as blends with alcohols and/or chlorocarbons, thereby

HCFC-22 is produced in several developed and develop-
ing countries. The US, EU, Japan, China, India, and Korea are
major producers of HCFC-22. HFC-23 is formed at the reactor
stage of the manufacture of HCFC-22 as a result of over-fluori-

the manufacturing process and varies from 1.4 to 4.0 % of the
production of HCFC-22 so that, while it is possible to reduce its
formation by optimizing process conditions, it is not possible
to eliminate the production of HFC-23. In a number of plants,
HFC-23 is destroyed by thermal oxidation. The cost of reduc-

In the 1960s and 1970s, the vast majority of these spray prod-

publication of the Rowland-Molina theory in 1974, the ban-

Sweden and Norway in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and the
ratification and implementation of the Montreal Protocol have

with HFCs account for a very small percentage of the overall

using flammable propellants but, after highly publicized safety
incidents, were reformulated to HFC-134a in many developed

"On an ozone-depletion-weighted basis, solvents constituted
approximately 15% of the market for chemicals targeted for
phase-out under the Montreal Protocol. In the case of the four
ozone-depleting substances used as solvents — CFC-113, CFC-
11, carbon tetrachloride and 1,1,1-trichloroethane (also known
as methyl chloroform) — most use by far involved CFC-113 and
1,1,1-trichloroethane in industrial applications and in industrial
cleaning equipment. Carbon tetrachloride was predominately
for dry-cleaning textiles, or in hand or maintenance cleaning.
The three main end uses of CFC-113 and 1,1,1-trichloroethane
in the past were metal cleaning, electronics cleaning, and
precision cleaning. Metal cleaning usually involves removing
cutting oils and residual metal filings from metal surfaces, and
the maintenance and repair of equipment and machinery. This
sector relied principally on 1,1,1-trichloroethane. Precision and
electronics cleaning mostly used CFC-113. Precision cleaning
mainly involves products that require a high level of cleanliness
and generally have complex shapes, small clearances, and other
cleaning challenges (UNEP, 1998). Electronics cleaning, or
defluxing, consists mainly of the removal of the flux residue
left after a soldering operation on printed circuit boards and
other contamination-sensitive electronics applications. Tables

Recently, some of these applications have moved to a newer

However, uncertainty about the toxicity of nPB has limited its
development in certain countries. Most of the displacement

The primary in-kind substitutes for 1,1,1-tricholorethane have
been the chlorocarbon alternatives such as trichloroethylene,
perchloroethylene and methylene chloride. These substitutes
have very low (0.005-0.007) ozone-depletion potential, and
similar cleaning properties (UNEP, 1998). These chemicals
were widely used for cleaning in the past until toxicity concerns
resulted in switches to ozone-depleting substances. In addition,
a brominated solvent — n-propyl bromide — was recently
introduced. It has similar properties and has acquired a definite

In the long-term, HFCs and PFCs are expected to acquire
a very small share of the ozone-depleting-solvent market. The
IPCC’s TAR has produced projections indicating that less than
3% of the possible CFC solvent demand will be replaced by
HFCs and PFCs (IPCC, 2001b). Some of the reasons for these
low uses are the higher cost of HFCs and PFCs, the ready
availability of other low cost and acceptable alternatives, and
the limited solvency of the common soils in these solvents.
Because of this limited use of HFC and other fluorinated
alternatives, the EU Commission did not include any restriction
on HFC solvent use in its recent proposed regulation on certain
fluorinated gases (CEC, 2003).

The in-kind substitutes for CFC-113 and CFC-11 are
fluorinated alternatives such as hydrochlorofluorocarbons
(HCEFC-141b and HCFC-225ca/cb), perfluorocarbons (primarily
C6F14), hydrofluorocarbons (HFC-43-10mee, HFC-365mfc
and HFC-245fa, HFC-c447ef) and hydrofluoroethers (HFE-
449s1, HFE-569sf2). HCFC-141b and HCFC-225ca/cb have
properties similar to CFC-113 and CFC-11 and have therefore
been preferred as alternatives where in-kind alternatives are
required. In particular, the low cost and good solvency of HCFC-
141b initially allowed it to capture a significant market share
of CFC solvents. However, HCFCs are transitional substances
due to their ozone-depleting potential. Their use is declining in
developed countries but still increasing in developing countries
(UNEP-TEAP, 2003).

PFC solvents such as C,F,, (PFC-5-1-14) have physical
properties similar to CFC-113. The atmospheric lifetimes and
GWPs of PFCs are very high (C,F,, has an atmospheric lifetime
of 3200 years and a GWP of 9140 (Table 2.6)). However, the
very limited solubility of organic soils in these materials has
restricted their use in cleaning to particulate removal and the
cleaning of fluorinated oils and greases (Agopovich, 2001). Due
to the high cost, the availability of substitutes, and regulations
restricting or banning use, PFC use has been limited primarily
to niche applications in developed countries (Japan, US and
Western Europe) with virtually no use in developing countries
or countries with economies in transition (IPCC/TEAP, 1999).
For example, in the US, PFC use is restricted to only those
applications where no other alternative meets performance or
safety requirements. In Germany, the use of CFCs, HCFCs,
HFCs and PFCs is prohibited in solvents, except the pertinent
authority can allow for high-quality applications provided
negative environmental impacts and impacts on the climate are
not expected and only if state-of-the-art technology does not

allow the use of any fluorine-free solvent (Germany, 1990).

points of trichloroethene (87°C) and tetrachloroethene (121°C)

tage in cleaning some soils such as resins and waxes (Risotto,
2001). However, in some instances, the solvent strength of the
chlorinated solvents may cause incompatibility with the com-

In tests with both new degreasers and retrofitted degreasers with
specified enhancement features, measurements of HFC, PFC
and HCFC solvent emissions showed that there was a decrease
of as much as 80% (Ramsey, 1996). Another study indicated
that retrofitting a vapour degreaser with an open-top area of 3.6
meters square (13 square feet) can, in combination with proper
maintenance, reduce emissions from a solvent process by 46 to
70 percent, depending on the specific retrofit methods chosen
(Durkee, 1997). With higher-cost fluorinated solvents, the pay-
off from upgrading an old degreaser to a new degreaser standard
is estimated to be > 62% (rate of return with break-even in less

"Most of the new solvent handling equipment is designed to
ensure very low emissions, partly because of the higher cost of
the HFC, PFC and HCFC solvents and partly due to increased
environmental awareness and regulations in some countries
for all solvents requiring zero or low emissions. The new tight
machines generally have higher freeboards, dual temperature
cooling coils, automated work transport facilities, welded
pipe joints, hoods or sliding doors, and superheated vapour
drying systems. Likewise, it is possible to reduce emissions
to a minimal level by implementing good handling practices,
such as reducing drag-out losses of solvent from the system by
keeping the workload in the vapour zone long enough to drain
and drop any entrapped or remaining solvent (UNEP, 1998). It
is also possible to minimize evaporative losses by improving
the design of solvent bath enclosures and of vapour-recovery
condensing systems (March, 1998).

Normal-propy! bromide (nPB) is a non-flammable, brominated

Normal-propyl bromide has low acute toxicity but its
complete toxicological profile necessitates a low exposure
guideline. Current exposure guidelines set by n-propyl bromide
manufacturers range from 5 to 100 ppm (US EPA, 2003b).
However, recent toxicological studies continue to raise concerns
regarding its chronic toxicity (both reproductive and central
nervous system effects), causing some organizations to suggest
that even lower exposure guidelines are required to protect
workers (CDHS, 2003). The EU has decided to reclassify its
toxicity as altering fertility and dangerous for the foetus (OJ,

Oxygenated organic solvents are compounds based on
hydrocarbons containing appendant oxygen (alcohols and
ketones), integral oxygens (ethers), or both (esters). These
substances have been used for many years in diverse cleaning
applications. Their cost and environmental impact are low
(low GWP, no ODP), except they are classified as VOCs and
may contribute to ground-level ozone pollution. Some of the
oxygenated compounds are flammable as neat product or the
mixture may become flammable in use. Precautions for handling
flammables must therefore be considered, e.g. explosion-proof
equipment.

These processes ¢ can be good substitutes for metal degreasing
or even precision cleaning when corrosion of the materials is
not an issue. For some tasks, where finish is a crucial issue, the
number of required washing and rinsing baths, and the quality of
the water, might be a deterrent. The availability of good-quality
water and water disposal issues need to be addressed from the
outset of process design. Aqueous cleaning processes have low
environmental impact (not VOCs, low GWP, and no ODP) and
low toxicity. The total TEWI can be equivalent to low-GWP
solvent processes, as energy for drying has to be included in the
total evaluation (ADL, 2002). It should be noted that a change
from solvent to water cleaning does require good training of the
workforce. The process is generally not forgiving; any error in
operation or maintenance could result in corrosion and other
quality problems. Investment costs can be high but operating

costs are generally lower than those with solvent alternatives.

Trifluoromethane (HFC-23) is formed at the re reactor stage
of the manufacture of chloro-difluoromethane (HCFC-22) as

conditions used in the manufacturing process and varies from
1.4% to 4.0% of the production of HCFC-22 so that, while it is

with a reported production of 77,310 metric tonnes in 2003,
and production in other Asian countries (notably China, India

are now 19 HCFC-22 producers in China with a total capacity
of 200,000 metric tones. They produced 177,000 metric tonnes

While such abatement measures serve to reduce or elimi-
nate emissions, the quantity of HFC-23 actually produced is
directly related to the production of HCFC-22 and so emission
projections require a scenario for future HCFC-22 production
volumes. These will depend on the consumption of HCFC-22 in
developed countries, which is declining, and the consumption
in developing countries and global demand for fluoropolymers
feedstock (UNEP-TEAP, 2003), both of which are increasing.

Consumption in developed countries is expected to decrease
as a consequence of increasingly stringent national and regional
regulations. However, a scenario that followed the requirements
of the Montreal Protocol exactly in these countries was adopted
as the best estimate (business-as-usual case) in the most recent
Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion (Fraser, Montzka et
al., 2003). This envisages that, by 2015, consumption of HCFC-
22 in these countries will have fallen by a factor of 10 from the

ficult than in a plant designed for HCFC-22 specifically. It is
to be expected that swing plants will operate at the higher end
of the HFC-23 production range (say 3 to 4% of HCFC-22 by

mass).

"In the most commonly used process, chlorodifluoromethane
(HCFC-22) is produced by the reaction of chloroform (CHCI,)
and anhydrous hydrogen fluoride (HF) in the presence of an
antimony pentachloride (SbCI,) catalyst. The reaction takes
place in a continuous-flow reactor full of boiling liquid, prod-
ucts being removed from the reaction system as vapours. Two
molecules of HF react with one molecule of chloroform to yield
chlorodifluoromethane, and reaction conditions are maintained
to optimize HCFC-22 production but overfluorination (reac-
tion of HCFC-22 with HF) can occur, yielding HFC-23 (CHF.,).
Consequently, the vapour stream leaving the reactor con-
tains, in addition to HCFC-22 (CHCIF,), HCFC-21 (CHCLF),
CHCI,, HF and some entrained catalyst (which are recycled to
the reactor) and also HFC-23 (CHF,) and HCl. Separation of
the hydrocarbon compounds is facilitated by the differences
in volatility, which makes it possible to condense the chloro-
form and HCFC-21 for recycling and conversion to HCFC-22.
It is technically feasible but not economical to convert HFC-
23, once formed, back into HCFC-22 (Merchant, 2001). Most
of the HFC-23 produced is released from the reaction system
at the control valve used to maintain the system pressure (the
“condenser vent”) and, unless separated for collection, is then
emitted to the atmosphere.

Fugitive emissions from leaking compressors, valves and
flanges. Because the process is maintained under relatively
high pressures, there is a potential for fugitive emissions
from leaking equipment. However, there is a strong
incentive to prevent leaks because of the noxious nature of
the reactor contents and the potential for loss of valuable
product (HCFC-22). Any leaks can usually be identified and
repaired quickly and effectively. Fugitive emissions are a
minor source; in two plants where they were measured, the
HCFC-22 lost in this way amounted to less than 0.1% of
plant production (Irving and Branscombe, 2000).

Removal with the HCFC-22 product and subsequent
emission. Industry standard specifications limit the
concentration of HFC-23 allowed in the product to a small
fraction of a percent. Consequently, removal with the
product also accounts for only a very small portion of the
HFC-23 that is generated.

Vents from product storage. These are not significant sources,
even when plants capture HFC-23 (by condensation at high
pressures and low temperatures) and subsequently store it
as pure material. The storage tanks are enclosed vessels,
not normally venting to atmosphere, and only a very small
fraction of the plants producing HCFC-22 recover HFC-
23. This is clear from the small quantity of HFC-23 that is
sold.

Further reductions in emissions beyond what is technically
achievable through process optimization require additional
equipment and, given that there is one main outlet for HFC-23
from the process, the most favourable option for eliminating
emissions is to collect and treat the vent gases. Thermal oxida-
tion is an effective treatment but the system must be designed
to cope with, and render harmless, the halogen acids (HF and
HCl) produced as a result of combustion. Depending on cost
and availability, treatment can be on- or off-site. Emission tests
at one plant showed that thermal oxidation destroys over 99.996
percent of the HFC-23 (Irving and Branscombe, 2000), making
this a highly effective treatment option. However, the impact of
the down-time of thermal oxidation units on the emissions of
HFC-23 needs to be considered (EFCTC, 2001).

"The most important of the additional loss routes is in the
aqueous phases from caustic and water scrubbers used
in the process. These may yield useful product, such
as hydrochloric acid (aqueous HCl), or be destined for
waste treatment, but in any case volatile organics in such
aqueous streams are readily emitted when the streams are
subsequently managed in open systems, such as wastewater
treatment processes. HFC-23 concentrations in the aqueous
effluent streams are only a few ppm at the most but the
concentration in aqueous HCI can be several hundred ppm
and this can represent an important release vector if the acid
is used untreated. However, compared to the condenser vent,
the aqueous HCI source is minor. Furthermore, the HFC-23
can be removed from the aqueous HC! by air-stripping for
subsequent treatment in the thermal oxidizer.

In view of the uncertainties of scenario generation, the busi-
ness-as-usual scenario uses consumption forecasts based on ad-
herence to the Montreal Protocol, with no further controls. This
is a fixed scenario (for the developed world) and amounts to a
90% reduction in the production and consumption of HCFCs
for non-feedstock uses there by 2015, although many countries
already have, or are planning, more stringent regulations. In
2010 in the US, the production and imports of HCFC-22 will be
banned under the US Clean Air Act (US EPA, 1993), except for
use in equipment manufactured before 2010. Within the EU, it
is estimated that levels of HCFC-22 production for non-feed-
stock uses will decrease by 30% by the year 2010 under EU
Regulation 2037/2000 on Substances that Deplete the Ozone
Layer (EFCTC, 2001). Such legislation is well documented
and the current effect on production of HCFC-22 is recorded
in the data reported by AFEAS (2003), which shows a fall of

Under the Montreal Protocol, the baseline year for develop-

grew over the four years from 1998 to 2001 at a linear rate of
18,100 tonnes yr! (R? = 0.95), or 26% in the year 2000 (CCR,
2002). When the other producers from developing countries
and countries with economies in transition are included in the
calculation, the growth rate reaches 20,000 tonnes yr! and this

Although it is technically feasible to manufacture HCFC-22 ina
reaction involving chloroform and HF in the vapour phase over
a solid catalyst, most, if not all, modern processes use the liq-
uid-phase route described above (Hoechst, 1962). Furthermore,
it is intrinsically more difficult to control a vapour-phase pro-
cess for minimizing the formation of HFC-23 than to control a
liquid-phase process. In the latter, conditions can be adjusted
so that the boiling liquid in the reactor contains little HCFC-
22, therefore minimizing the possibilities of fluorinating it to
produce HFC-23. In the vapour phase, on the other hand, all
HCFC-22 that is produced co-exists towards the exit of the cat-
alyst with the excess of HF. In a vapour-phase process it is not
impossible to adjust conditions to minimize HFC-23; it is only
more difficult to do so than in the liquid phase.

"	Text
"Total direct emissions amount to about 2.5 GtCO,-eq yr!
(2.0 GtCO,-eq yr using SAR/TAR values), which is similar
to the estimate derived in Chapter 2 from atmospheric mea-
surements. However, as shown in Table 11.6 and in Figure
2.4, there are significant differences between calculated and
observed emissions of individual substances. For CFC-11,
HCFC-141b and HCFC-142b in particular, the observations
indicate significantly higher emissions but the resolution of
these systematic errors, while important and urgent, is out-
side the scope of this report. The errors affect the results
quantitatively, but qualitative conclusions are sound.

There are opportunities to reduce direct emissions signifi-
cantly through the global application of best practices and
recovery methods, with a reduction potential of about 1.2
GtCO,-eq yr"" of direct emissions by 2015, as compared to
the business-as-usual scenario. The potential emission re-
ductions involve a broad range of costs: from net zero to
US$300 per tonne of CO, equivalent. These estimates are
based on a mitigation scenario which assumes the global
application of best practices for the use, recovery and de-
struction of these substances. About 60% of this potential
is HFC emission reduction; HCFCs and CFCs contribute
about 30% and 10% respectively.

Recovery, recycling and reclamation, and the destruction
of refrigerant not suitable for reprocessing, may reduce
emissions by as much as 20%. Licensing and compliance
programmes may have a significant impact, with average
leakage rates being achievable of less than 5% for stationary
equipment and 12% for mobile systems. The costs for units
used for recovery and recovery/recycling start at approxi-
mately US$500. Recovery, recycling and reuse costs may
be offset by the savings in new refrigerant purchases. The
destruction of contaminated and unwanted refrigerant can
be achieved for less than US$3.

In some sectors, action to reduce indirect emissions (for
example, through the improved energy efficiency of appli-
ances) will have a significantly higher impact than focusing
exclusively on the chemicals used.
"	List
"Current production capacity for HFCs and PFCs exceeds
current demand. There are a number of plants in devel-
oped countries and one plant in a developing country. The
estimated production capacity for HFC-134a in 2002 was
185,000 tonnes. No published data are available to forecast
future production capacity. However, as there are no techni-
cal or legal limits to production, it can be assumed that pro-
duction will continue at a rate necessary to satisfy demand
over time, although short-term fluctuations are possible.
Future production has therefore been estimated by aggre-
gating sectoral demand.

Major drivers of demand for HFCs and PFCs include the
Montreal Protocol and the expected worldwide increase in
disposable income. HCFCs, HFCs and PFCs, together with
not-in-kind alternatives, have contributed to the phase-out
of CFCs and halons. The Multilateral Fund of the Montreal
Protocol has been instrumental in introducing CFC replace-
ments in the markets of the developing countries. Nearly
US$ 130 million has been disbursed to the developing coun-
tries for the conversion to HFCs, with another US$ 250 mil-
lion being disbursed for the conversion to HCFCs.
Emissions of CFCs have fallen significantly over the period
1990-2000. HCFC emissions have grown significantly dur-
ing this period. HFC emissions are also increasing. Demand
for HCFCs, and hence emissions, are expected to continue
to rise significantly between 2000 and 2015, especially in
developing countries. The fall in CFC emissions will not
necessarily be accompanied by a directly proportional in-
crease in emissions of HCFCs and HFCs because of the
switch to alternatives, improvements in design, contain-
ment, and improved recovery and disposal practices.
Despite the fall in the production of CFCs, the existing
bank of CFCs is over 1.1 million tonnes and is therefore a
significant source of potential future emissions. Banks of
HCFCs and HFCs are being established as use increases.
The management of CFC and HCFC banks is not controlled
by the Montreal Protocol or taken into account under the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC).

Byproduct emissions of HFC-23 are expected to rise glob-
ally by 60% during this period — especially in developing
countries — but these emissions can be significantly reduced
with best-practice capture and the destruction of vent gas-
es.

The estimates of aggregate emissions for the business-as-
usual scenario differ from other emission estimates (the
IPCC (2000) SRES scenarios, for example), largely as a re-
sult of the more detailed analyses of the current applications
that have been carried out for the purposes of this report.
The SRES scenarios relied mainly on the application of re-
gional economic growth factors to the baseline consumption
of individual compounds; furthermore, little distinction was

tion of the aggregate extent of the additional emission reduction
opportunities that may be available through the implementation
of additional measures.
"	Text
"In estimating the supply of HFCs and PFCs, the basic assump-
tion is that supply will match demand. In addition, for current
production, the aggregate supply of some individual substances
can be verified using published capacity and production data.
For projections, a check of this kind is not possible. Demand
can exceed supply in some circumstances because chemical
producers may be unwilling to invest in new plants due to un-
certainties resulting from the threat of government regulation.
This, in turn, may result in tight supply, which will increase
prices and may increase the use of alternatives. If this happens,
actual use and emissions of HFCs and PFCs will be lower than
projected in this chapter.

Two scenarios have been developed for demand (see Section
11.5), the first one based on business-as-usual assumptions (i.e.
that all existing measures, including the Montreal Protocol, will
continue and that no new measures will be introduced), and an-
other mitigation scenario based on an increased effort to achieve
emission reductions through the global application of current
best-practice emission reduction techniques (e.g. containment,
recovery, recycling and destruction). The precise assumptions
included in the mitigation scenario vary between chapters — and
therefore these assumptions are discussed in detail in each of
the chapters. Because the Kyoto Protocol does not impose spe-
cific emission limitations on a substance-by-substance basis,
the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol does not directly alter
either of the scenarios. However, national measures related to
fluorocarbons have been included where they have been intro-
duced or announced.

"This chapter has three major objectives. The first is to produce
global estimates for current and future demand by aggregat-
ing “bottom-up” sectoral information, and to compare this
with information about supply from known chemical produc-
tion facilities. The second is to compare the associated “bot-
tom-up” sectoral estimates of emissions with the “top-down”
estimates derived from observations of atmospheric concentra-
tions of the selected chemical species presented in Chapter 2.
The third objective is the identification of the global extent of
the opportunity for additional emission reductions through the
implementation of additional sectoral measures beyond busi-
ness as usual. Data have been presented in both metric tonnes
and also in CO,-equivalent-weighted tonnes. These data have
been calculated using the global warming potentials that appear
in Section 2.5 of this report and also the global warming poten-
tials in the IPCC 2™ and 3"" Assessment Reports (IPCC, 1996,
2001). These SAR and TAR values are those used by parties
to the UNFCCC for reporting inventory data and also adopted
(Decision 1CP/5) in the Kyoto Protocol'. Use of these values
facilitates a comparison against the regulatory commitments
adopted within these agreements.

Technical advances subsequently accelerated the com-

not-in-kind technologies. Consistent with these advances, the
Montreal Protocol was further amended in 1992 to require a
phase-out of HCFCs. By 1998, the TEAP reports were noting a
rapid development of technologies that were no longer reliant
on fluorocarbons (UNEP-TEAP, 1998).

primarily from Ashford ef al. (2004) and supplemented by data
from Chapters 4 — 10 in this report, UNEP (2004b) and AFEAS

In the absence of the Montreal Protocol, the use of CFCs
would have increased significantly (Prather et al., 1996).
However, as a result of its adoption, the use and production of
CFCs and halons have almost completely ceased in developed
countries (UNEP, 2004b), and are rapidly falling in developing
countries, as demanded by the schedule in the protocol. The
use of HFCs has facilitated this rapid phase-out in developed
countries, particularly (but not solely) in applications where

When the Montreal Protocol was signed in 1987, alternatives
to CFCs and halons were not commercially available for most
applications. By 1989, the first reports of the UNEP Technology
Assessment Panels of the Montreal Protocol (UNEP-TEAP,
1989, Chapter 3.10) concluded that, while non-fluorocarbon
alternatives including not-in-kind alternatives would be impor-
tant, HCFCs and HFCs would be necessary in order to make
substantial and timely reductions in CFC and halon consump-
tion. In 1990 the Montreal Protocol was amended to require a
phase-out of CFCs, halons, carbon tetrachloride and 1,1,1-tri-
chloroethane.

"other alternatives were not available. In many cases, HFCs are
still important for the safe and cost-effective phase-out of CFCs
and halons in countries with economies in transition and in de-
veloping countries (UNEP-TEAP, 2004). Developed countries
have replaced about 8% of projected CFC use with HFCs and
12% with HCFCs. They have eliminated the remaining 80%
by controlling emissions, making specific use reductions, or by
using alternative technologies and non-HCFC and HFC fluids,
including ammonia, carbon dioxide, water and not-in-kind op-
tions. Approximately 20% of halon use has been replaced by
HFCs, less than 1% by PFCs and 50% by non-gaseous agents
(UNEP-TEAP, 1999b). Some of the options are shown in Table

"Emissions of HFCs and PFCs occur during the production of
fluorocarbons, either as undesired byproducts or as losses of
useful material, for example during the filling of containers or
when production equipment is opened for maintenance. In gen-
eral, the emissions during production are much smaller than the
emissions during the use of the products. Nevertheless, tech-
niques and procedures to minimize emissions have been de-
veloped, including the thermal oxidation of gas streams before
they are released into the atmosphere. Calculating emissions
from such sources requires data about not only the quantities
of materials produced (the activity) and the rate of emission
(which is influenced by the process design and operating cul-
ture) but also about the extent to which emissions are abated.

tion of HCFC-22 (see Table 10.10 in Chapter 10, and the de-
scription of chemical routes of manufacture i in Appendix 11A).

countries) will emit HFC-23 at a rate of 4% (see Chapter 10).
Consequently, emissions of HFC-23 could grow by 60% be-
tween now and 2015, from about 15,000 tonnes yr in 2003 to
23, 000 tonnes yr! (Table 10.10).

The reduction of HCFC- 22 production due to market forces
or national policies, or improvements in facility design and con-
struction to reduce HFC-23 output, could further influence these
scenarios. An additional factor is the possible implementation
of Clean Development Mechanism projects to install destruc-
tion facilities in non-annex I countries. This could result in a
more rapid reduction of HFC-23 emissions than would other-
wise have occurred.

As noted under 11.3.2, the production and use of CFCs and
halons have almost completely ceased in developed countries,
and are rapidly falling in developing countries (Ashford et al.,
2004). HFCs and HCFCs have replaced about 8% and 12% of
projected CFC use respectively in developed countries (UNEP-
TEAP, 1999b). Similarly, about 20 % of halon use has been
replaced by HFCs and less than 1% by PFCs (UNEP-TEAP,
1999b). The resulting changes in historic emissions of CFCs
and HCFCs are shown in Table 11.4 (Ashford et al., 2004).

Despite an equivalent fall in production of CFCs, the bank
of material that remains in equipment and has not yet been emit-
ted remains significant. For example, in the year 2002, the CFC
bank amounted to over 2.4 million tonnes, consisting mainly
of CFC-11 in foams (UNEP-TEAP, 2002ab). In addition to the
emissions of CFCs and HCFCs from future consumption in de-

In the variant for this $ scenario, the current best-practice
technology, which includes the capture and thermal oxidation
of the “vent gases”, is introduced into all facilities progressively
from 2005 onwards. Destruction technology is assumed to be
100% efficient and to operate for 90% of the on-line time of
HCFC-22 plants. Reduced emissions were calculated for the
same activity (in the form of assumed future HCFC-22 produc-
tion) as the business-as-usual case. The difference between the
two HFC-23 forecasts is therefore solely due to the extent of the
deployment of destruction technology. The forecasts represent
potential extreme cases, and future changes in activity will tend
to increase the probability of one or the other.

The quantity of HFC-23 that is produced (and that, po-
tentially, may be emitted) is directly related to the production
of HCFC-22 and so emission forecasts require a scenario for
future HCFC-22 production volumes. These will depend on
the consumption of HCFC-22 in developed countries, which
is declining, and the consumption in developing countries and
global demand for fluoropolymers feedstock, both of which
are increasing (see Section 10.4). After thorough investigation,
the US EPA concluded that process optimization reduces, but
does not eliminate, HFC-23 emissions. To reduce the emissions
below the 1% level, thermal oxidation is required (Irving and
Branscombe, 2002).

On the basis of a business-as-usual scenario that assumes
that consumption of ozone-depleting substances will match the
maximum levels permitted under the Montreal Protocol, the
consumption and production of non-feedstock HCFC-22 will
fall by a factor of almost 10 by 2015 from the average level in
2000-2003 in developed countries (including the 15% produc-
tion allowance to meet the basic domestic needs of developing
countries). In developed countries, demand for fluoropolymer
feedstock is projected to continue increasing linearly, lead-
ing to a doubling in feedstock demand for HCFC-22 in those
countries by 2015 (see Section 10.4). In developing countries,
production of HCFC-22 for both feedstock and non-feedstock
uses has grown rapidly in recent years; over the period 1997
to 2001, production for potentially emissive (or non-feedstock)
uses grew linearly at 20,000 tonnes yr"" and feedstock use grew
at 4,100 tonnes yr! (see Chapter 10) Assuming that these rates
continue until 2015, the total global requirement for HCFC-22
will be about 707,000 tonnes yr, about 40% of which would
be for feedstock, compared to a total of 490,000 tonnes yr"" in
the year 2000 (Table 10.10).

The differences between emissions estimates constitute a
long-standing problem that has yet to be resolved by the re-

be drawn for all gases and for some gases, notably the HFCs,
atmospheric concentrations match emissions estimates and
quantitative conclusions are justified. Current CFC emissions
are dominated by delayed releases from banks (such as mate-
rial contained in existing foams, air conditioning, refrigeration,

the reuse of refrigerant affected by recovery programmes, and
the prevention of leakage and losses through improved work

With CFCs phased out in developed countries, the produc-
tion of HFCs and PFCs for supply is now focused upon main-
taining the existing market, satisfying market growth, exports to
other markets and developing capacity to cater for the demand
for replacing HCFCs. Rapidly expanding markets in develop-
ing countries, in particular for CFC replacements, are resulting
in new capacity for fluorinated gases, currently through the ex-
pansion of HCFC-22 and -141b capacity. Much of this is being
achieved through local production in developing countries and
joint ventures.

"As a result, investments are likely to be made in existing sites
and the number of production sites can be expected to remain
limited. Greenfield investment will most likely occur in regions
with substantial market potential, particularly China. Equally,
supply can be expected to follow demand more closely than has
been the case for CFCs and HCFCs. The perceived regulatory
risks, and the existence of valid process patents, may discour-
age the conversion of current production facilities for ozone-
depleting substances in developing countries to HFC and PFC
production (with the latter being less likely). Furthermore, due
to the complexity of the processes, most production facilities
for ozone-depleting substances are not easily convertible to
HFC production.

Recovery, recycling and reclamation take place on a number
of levels in developed countries. In many developed countries
and regions — Australia, the European Union, United States and
Japan for example — there are regulatory requirements that man-
date the removal of “used” fluorinated gases from equipment
during dismantling and destruction, and/or regulations that
prohibit the venting of fluorinated gases. These requirements
have been extended, or are in the process of being extended, to
include HFCs and PFCs (Snelson and Bouma, 2003). In cer-
tain regions, the regulatory requirements are supported by in-
dustry voluntary schemes. In developing countries, UNEP has
launched initiatives to encourage the recovery and recycling of
CFCs and HCFCs although, at present, these have not been ex-
tended to HFCs and PFCs (UNEP, 2003).

large distributors of fluorinated gases collecting and either re-

sometimes as feedstock. In the EU, where used refrigerants
are classed as “hazardous waste”, transportation is a costly bu-

Similar recovery, recycling and reclamation processes take
place in the fire-fighting industry. For the foam industry, the
recovery of the foam products during the dismantling of foam-
containing equipment and buildings is possible and, in some
developed countries, mandatory. Fluorinated gases that are re-
covered will primarily be sent for destruction, as the presence of
contaminants makes recycling and reuse non-economic. In the
case of solvent use, recycling is an integral part of the process
in which they are used: the solvents are boiled constantly in the
equipment in which they are used and the vapour is condensed
and reused. Solvents are also recovered from equipment and re-
cycled externally from that equipment; this work is mainly done
by the user of the solvent. Once the solvent reaches a level of
contamination where recycling is not possible, it is destroyed.
During the manufacture of metered dose inhalers, fluorinated
gases are captured during the filling process and recycled in
the filling equipment, thereby reducing emissions. Recycling
of fluorinated gases externally is not often seen as an option
because of contamination with pharmaceutical residues.

Improvements in technical standards and their conscientious
application will result in significant reductions in direct and
indirect emissions. The application of technical standards can
be effectively achieved within a licensing or accreditation pro-

Initially, the levy applied only to ozone-depleting refrigerants
but it was extended in 2004 to “synthetic greenhouse gas” refrig-

application to, and approval from, the Australian Competition

"It is uncertain whether recovery, recycling or reclamation of the
actual fluorinated gases from foam products will increase in the
future and thereby have a substantial impact on emissions. For
CFC-11, recovery from foams is discouraged by the chemical’s

For HFCs, recovery may be more attractive due to the higher
market values of the chemicals. Even if the chemicals are not
recovered, however, a major abatement option will be the re-
covery of used foam products and their subsequent destruction.
Either destruction or chemical recovery could substantially re-

The activities underlying emissions of fluorocarbons are ex-
pected to expand significantly between now and 2015. These
activities (such as the requirements for refrigeration, air condi-

including CFCs and HCFCs. In industrialized countries, the
use and emissions of CFCs and HCFCs will decline as obsolete
equipment is retired. In developing countries, ozone-deplet-

These changes, and their impacts as developed by previous

recovery efficiency and the extent of recovery are improved,
and the quantities in systems are reduced. This has the effect
of reducing the atmospheric concentration (and also the cli-

Table 11.6 above shows, for the business-as-usual case, the ex-
pected future emissions arising from the use of HFCs in all sec-
tors, predominantly refrigeration, foam blowing, solvents and
aerosols. Sectoral emission functions that reflect the current
levels of containment were applied to the activities projected
for these uses so that growth in emissions reflects growth in use.
These emissions will be accompanied by significant changes
in the banks of fluorocarbons remaining in equipment and not
yet released. In the case of HFC-134a, the quantity retained in
equipment is expected to increase in this scenario to 2.2 million
metric tonnes by 2015 from the 2002 level of 517,000 metric
tonnes (Ashford e et al., 2004).

The alternative scenario for byproduct emissions of HFC-23 as-
sumes that the current best-practice technology, comprising the
capture and thermal oxidation of “vent gases”, is introduced
into all facilities progressively from 2005 onwards. Destruction
technology is assumed to be 100% efficient and to operate for
90% of the on-line time of the HCFC-22 plant. Reduced emis-
sions were calculated on the basis of the same level of activ-
ity (in the form of assumed future HCFC-22 production) as the
business-as-usual case. The difference between the two HFC-
23 forecasts is therefore solely due to the extent of deployment
of destruction technology. The forecasts represent potential ex-
treme cases and future changes in activity will tend to increase
the probability of one forecast or the other.

Emissions of HFC-23 from the production of HCFC-22 have
significant climate impact. As discussed above, these emissions
may be reduced by changes to process procedures or eliminated
by thermal oxidation without compromising the ability to pro-
duce HCFC-22, which will continue to be required as a fluo-
ropolymer feedstock after its commercial uses have been phased
out. The emissions of HFC-23 expected under the business-as-
usual case to 2015 are shown in Table 10.10. It has been as-
sumed that emissions from existing capacity (in both developed
and developing countries) will continue at 2% of HCFC-22 pro-
duction and that new capacity (mainly in developing countries)
will emit HFC-23 at a rate of 4%. Consequently, emissions of
HFC-23 could increase by 60% between now and 2015 from
about 15,000 tonnes yr in 2003 to 23,000 tonnes yr"".

There are opportunities to reduce direct emissions signifi-
cantly through the global application of best practices and re-
covery methods, with a reduction potential of about 1.2 GtCO,-
eq yr! (1.0 GtCO,-eq yr using SAR/TAR values) of direct
emissions by 2015, as compared to the BAU scenario. About
60% of this potential is HFC emission reduction; HCFCs and
CFCs contribute about 30% and 10% respectively. A key fac-
tor determining whether this potential will be realized are the
costs associated with the implementation of the measures to
achieve the emission reduction. These vary considerably from
a net benefit to 300 US$/tCO,-eq (Chapters 4-10 of this report,
US- EPA, 2004). Chapters 4-10 of this report have identified
various reduction opportunities. The major opportunities for
reducing greenhouse-gas emissions in the period prior to 2015

"notably from refrigeration banks, can be expected during the
next decade (CFC emissions fall to approximately 0.3 GtCO,-
eq yr' in 2015). Most greenhouse-gas emissions from foams
are expected to occur after 2015. HCFC emissions are projected
to increase by a factor of two between 2002 and 2015, owing
to a steep increase in the use in refrigeration and air-condition-
ing (AC) applications, in particular in commercial refrigeration
and stationary air-conditioning (commercial refrigeration rep-
resents about 25% of the total of all refrigeration, AC and MAC
systems). HFC emissions are projected to increase by about a
factor of three, particularly in refrigeration, the stationary AC
and MAC sectors, and due to byproduct emissions of HFC-23
during HCFC-22 production. It is expected that these projected
increases will be accompanied by a build-up of banks and a cor-
responding added potential for future radiative forcing, depend-
ing on bank management and, notably, end-of-life measures.
Action in these sub-sectors could therefore have a substantial
influence on future emissions of HCFCs and HFCs.

20 to 250 US$/tCO,-eq?. Specific costs differ per region and
per solution. Improved containment, and end-of-life recovery
(both of CFC-12 and HFC-134a) and recycling (of HFC-134a),
could reduce direct GHG emissions by up to 50%, and total (di-

New systems with either CO, or HFC-152a are likely to pen-

system emission reductions estimated at 50 to 70% in 2015.
Hydrocarbons are in use as service refrigerants in several coun-

Residential and commercial air conditioning and _heat-

ing: Direct greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions of residential
and commercial air conditioning and heating equipment can
be reduced by about 200 MtCO,-eq yr! (169 MtCO,-eq yr
using SAR/TAR values) relative to the BAU scenario (2015).
Specific costs range from —3 to 170 US$/tCO,-eq?. Improved
system energy efficiencies can significantly reduce indirect
GHG emissions, leading in some cases to overall savings of 75
US$/tCO,-eq. Opportunities to reduce direct GHG (i.e. refrig-
erant) emissions can be found in (i) more efficient recovery of
refrigerant at end-of-life (in the mitigation scenario, this is as-
sumed to be up to 50% and 80% for developing and developed
countries, respectively); (ii) charge reduction (up to 20%); (iii)
better containment and (iv) the use of non-fluorocarbon refrig-

erants in suitable applications.

"Medical Aerosols: The reduction potential for medical aero-

40 MtCO,-eq yr! (using SAR/TAR values, this is 10 as com-
pared to 34 MtCO2-eq yr‘) to a reduction of GHG emissions
for metered dose inhalers (MDIs) would be achieved by the
completion of the transition from CFC to HFC MDIs beyond
what is already assumed to be BAU. The health and safety of
the patient is of paramount importance in treatment decisions,
and there are significant medical constraints on the use of HFC
MDIs. If salbutamol MDIs (approximately 50% of total MDIs)
were to be replaced by dry powder inhalers (this is not an as-
sumption in the mitigation scenario) this would only result in an
annual emission reduction of about 10 MtCO,-eq yr! by 2015,

Fire protection: In fire protection, the potential reduction
by 2015 is small due to the relatively low emission level, the
significant shifts to not-in-kind alternatives in the past and the
lengthy procedures for introducing new equipment. Direct
GHG emissions for the sector are estimated at about 5 MtCO,-
eq yr (about 4 MtCO,-eq yr! using SAR/TAR values) in 2015
(BAU). Agents with no climate impact have replaced 75% of
original halon use . Four percent of the original halon appli-
cations continue to employ halons. The remaining 21% has
been replaced by HFCs, with a small number of applications
switching to HCFCs and to PFCs. PFCs are no longer needed
for new fixed systems and are limited to use as propellants in
one manufacturer’s portable-extinguisher agent blend. Due to
the lengthy process of testing, approval and market acceptance
for new types of equipment and agents for fire protection, no
additional options are likely to have an appreciable impact by
2015. With the introduction of a fluoroketone (FK) in 2002, ad-
ditional reductions at increased cost will be possible in this sec-
tor through 2015. Currently, those reductions are estimated to

For non- -medic al aerosols and solvents, the reduction po-
tentials are likely to be rather small because most remaining
uses are critical to performance or safety. The projected BAU
emissions by 2015 for solvents and aerosols are about 14 and
23 MtCO,-eq yr""! respectively (the figures are about the same
with SAR/TAR values). The replacement of HFC-134a by
HFC-152a in technical aerosol dusters is a leading option for
reducing GHG emissions. For contact cleaners and mould re-
lease agents for plastic casting, the substitution of HCFCs by
HFEs and HFCs with lower GWPs offers an opportunity. Some
countries have banned HFC use in novelty aerosol products,
although HFC-134a continues to be used in many countries for
safety reasons.

with rapid emissions, have largely disappeared in developed
countries (AFEAS, 2004; Montzka and Fraser, 2002) and are
gradually being minimized in developing countries. Current
fluorocarbon consumption is dominated by their continuing use

When calculating banks of fluorocarbon and other chemi-
cals in refrigeration and in foams, it is necessary to study sales
of equipment and/or products, lifetime aspects, leakage during
use, and end-of-life issues. This bottom-up approach is based
on data from surveys, which must be well designed to ensure
complete coverage. However, there are usually cross-checks to
ensure completeness. Emission factors for refrigeration equip-
ment and foams have been assessed over several years. These
vary significantly according to the application and good market
analysis is required to ensure the use of appropriately weighted
emission factors. The differences between consumption and
forecast emissions using these functions are assigned to banks,
which accrue and diminish with time. Verification of the physi-
cal existence of these banks (e.g. Mizuno, 2003) has largely
served to confirm the appropriateness of the emission functions
adopted, although year-to-year emission projections can have
significant error bars for banks that release slowly (e.g. foams),
particularly where emission projections are largely based on
end-of-life practices. These year-to-year errors tend to be offset

Measurements of long-lived species are re performed frequent-
ly and with high accuracy in several measurement networks.
The uncertainty in derived emissions depends on the uncertain-
ty in the trend in observed concentration and on the uncertainty
in the lifetime. Both are relatively small for most species. Using
different measurement networks may also yield different emis-
sions and therefore information about the uncertainty. On this
basis, the uncertainty in derived emissions is about 10% for CFC-
11 and between 1% and 6% for other long-lived halocarbons.

Since 1976, the chemical industry has voluntarily reported
the production and sales of fluorocarbons through a survey com-
piled by an independent accountant. The purpose is to provide
the scientific community with data estimating the atmospheric
release of CFCs and the alternative fluorocarbons. Data are cur-
rently available up until 2002 for all relevant CFCs, HCFCs
and HFCs. The sum of all CFC production reported as above
to AFEAS in 2002 was only 3% of the total in the peak year,
1988 (AFEAS, 2004). The alternatives initially grew rapidly
after their introduction to replace CFCs but currently have var-
ied growth rates, with most levelling off as they become more
mature products (Table 11B).

The companies surveyed by AFEAS include subsidiaries
and joint ventures in all developed and many developing coun-
tries. Some production in developing countries, for example
in China, India and Korea, is not included in the survey. The
data collected by AFEAS for 2002 are thought (by comparison
with the UNEP totals for production) to cover about 30-35% of
global CFC production. Global coverage is much greater in the
AFEAS survey for the HCFCs and HFCs. The AFEAS data cur-

are thought to represent at least 97% of global HFC production

The determination of emissions via the bottom-up method
has revealed substantial discrepancies with the emissions calcu-
lated from atmospheric measurements of the same chemicals.
However, closer analysis of these discrepancies has found that
even relatively small levels of consumption of fluorocarbons
in rapidly emitting uses in developing countries can dominate
emissions for specific chemicals (e.g. CFC-11) in specific years.
This implies that there is a need to investigate production data,
both from producers as reported to AFEAS and from countries
as submitted to UNEP under the Montreal Protocol (Article 7
on data reporting), in order to determine where such emissions
might appear. However, the key weakness in the UNEP data set
is that it makes no provision for the recording of use patterns.
Nonetheless, the quantification of the gap between UNEP pro-
duction/consumption data and AFEAS data is essential.

"The improvement of knowledge about the use of the indi-
vidual chemicals, both in the developed and in the developing
countries, as well as uncertainties in emissions factors from
banks following the bottom-up method, is unlikely to bear fruit
within the time scale of this report. This has implications for the
calculation of emission scenarios for the period 2002-2015, in
particular the contributions from developing countries. It may
therefore be the case that the emissions are significantly larger
than calculated via the bottom-up method for refrigeration and

This implies that, in the near future, further study is needed
of the use patterns for the total production forecast for the pe-
riod 2002-2015 in both the developed and the developing coun-
tries. Further study will also be needed to make more precise
estimates of future emissions from banks in refrigeration and
foams, given the accuracy of calculations of the size of the
banks and the emissions derived from them, as well as servic-
ing practices, and issues relating to recovery and recycling and
end-of-life.

In addition, the emission factors applied to HCFCs and
HFCs were derived from those developed earlier for CFCs and
HCFC-22. However, there have been considerable changes in
use practices in the wake of the Montreal Protocol and emission
factors are subject to continual review. Revised emission factors,
as described in McCulloch er al. (2001 and 2003), have helped
improve the situation and have been used in the most recent cal-
culation of emissions (AFEAS, 2004). Nonetheless, the view is
that variation and uncertainties in emission factors per se are less
significant overall than uncertainties in overall use pattern dis-
tributions between rapid-release applications and the delayed-
release applications represented by refrigeration and foams.

This said, estimates of atmospheric concentrations based on
production statistics provided by manufacturers and national
governments coupled with historical emission factors were, un-
til recently, a good match with observations (McCulloch et al.,
2001, 2003), largely because of the dominance of rapid-release
applications in developed countries. However, as the detailed
assessment of delayed-release applications has become more
important in developed countries and the gap between UNEP
data and AFEAS data has increased, reflecting higher levels of
activity in developing countries, the lack of use pattern data via
the UNEP reporting structure is now a key impediment, particu-
larly where usage might be occurring in rapid-release applica-
tions.

"ported to AFEAS and the ones reported by the same countries
to UNEP concur quite well in the early 1990s for CFC-11 and
CFC-12. The differences increase after 1995, particularly for
CFC-11, where there seems to be a systematic over-reporting to
UNEP, or under-reporting to AFEAS, whilst the differences for
CFC-12 remain more or less the same, also because quantities
are larger. Reporting for HCFC-22 generally shows significant
under-reporting by UNEP compared to AFEAS, with differenc-
es in the order of 10% or more. In the case of HCFC-22 it can
be clearly seen that the quantity produced in 2002 by countries
not reporting to AFEAS is more than 40% of the total. In the
case of HCFC-141b, the agreement between AFEAS and UNEP
reporting is remarkably good, with annual differences smaller
than about 5%.

"Annual production and sales data are reported to AFEAS for
each of the 12 fluorocarbons surveyed. Sales are divided into
use categories — refrigeration, foam blowing distinguishing be-
tween open-and closed-cell foams, aerosols, and all other uses
— to the best knowledge of the fluorocarbon producers. Some
degree of geographical breakdown is also provided but the
AFEAS survey does not distinguish between developing and
developed countries. Emissions of the individual fluorocarbons
to the atmosphere are estimated by applying emission factors
to the sales reported in each use category. These factors are de-
rived from a consideration of the respective emission patterns
and release delays for each application but are not always as
sophisticated as those used in the bottom-up assessments. By
way of an example, the allocation of all HCFC-141b foam sales
to “closed-cell foams” may be inappropriate in view of uses in

integral skin and other more rapid-release foam applications.

Existing cement kilns can destroy organic compounds as the

Waste refrigerants are rapidly heated to 3000°C where pyrolysis
occurs. This process is followed by rapid alkaline quenching
that prevents the formation of dioxins and furans. Neutralization
occurs with alkaline liquor. The waste gases, CO, and argon are
vented, whilst the resulting halide salt solution consisting of
NaCl and NaF is discharged to wastewater treatment.

Rotary kiln incinerators are refractory-lined rotating cylindri-
cal steel shells mounted on a slight incline from the horizon-
tal. Most rotary kilns are equipped with an after-burner which
ensures complete destruction of exhaust gases. Waste gases
can be fed into the rotary kiln or directly into the after-burner.
Rotary kilns are most frequently incorporated into the design of
commercial incinerator facilities. Because of the production of
acid byproducts, there are generally severe restrictions on the
amount of halocarbons in the raw material feed.

The solvated electron process is a batch process operated at
atmospheric pressure using two vessels: one heated reaction
vessel, and the other a refrigerated ammonia recycle vessel.
Refrigerants are decomposed in the reaction vessel with liquid
ammonia and metallic sodium. The resulting wastes are chiefly
halide salts and biodegradable organic compounds. On a pilot
scale, the process has been shown to destroy various fluorocar-
bons at an efficiency of 99.99% but a commercial facility for
this application has not been established.

The gaseous/fume process uses refractory-lined combustion
chambers for the thermal destruction of waste vapour streams.
Waste fluorocarbons may be destroyed by feeding directly from
their pressurized storage into the incinerator. Fume incinera-
tors are typically found installed with manufacturing plants and
are seldom used for commercial hazardous waste incineration.
A version of this process known as High Temperature Steam
Decomposition is operated by Ineos Fluor at Mihara in Japan.
The rated throughput for CFCs is up to 165 kg/hr. Neutralization
occurs with the use of Ca(OH),, resulting in solid waste CaF,
and CaCl.

This process involves the preheating of liquid or gas with boiler
steam before injection into the reactor. The atomized gas mix-
ture is heated by vertical radiant tubes with internal electric
heating elements to approximately 850°C. Organic compounds
are ultimately reduced to methane, hydrochloric acids and low-
molecular-weight hydrocarbons. The formation of some di-
oxins and furans is possible. Hydrochloric acid is neutralized
by caustic soda, and a scrubbing system removes inorganics.
Hydrogen and methane are recovered for energy use. This pro-
cess has successfully destroyed other wastes on a commercial
basis but not fluorocarbons.

The reactor cracking process uses a cylindrical water-cooled re-
actor made of graphite, and an oxygen-hydrogen burner system.
The reactor is flanged directly to an absorber. Waste refriger-
ants are fed into the reaction chamber where the temperature is
maintained at between 2000°C and 2600°C. The waste is bro-
ken down into HF, HCI, Cl,, CO,, and H,O. The cracked prod-
ucts are cooled in the absorber and the acid gases purified and
recovered at technical grade quality. This is the most widely
used commercial process for the destruction of fluorocarbons in
Europe. The plant and technology are owned and operated by
Solvay. In mid-2000, approximately 7000 Mt of fluorocarbons
had been decomposed with a reactor capacity of 200 kg/hr.

"This process does not require the electrodes needed for the DC
process as the energy coupling to the plasma is achieved through
the electromagnetic field of the induction coil. A demonstra-

tonnes of CFC-12 was destroyed. Gaseous CFCs and steam are
fed through the plasma torch where they are heated and enter
directly into the destruction reactor maintained at approximate-
ly 2000°C. The subsequent gases are cooled and scrubbed with
a caustic solution to remove acid gases. This process has been
commercialized in Japan by Ichikawa Kankyo Engineering.
Neutralization occurs with the use of Ca(OH),, resulting in sol-
id waste CaF, and CaCl,. An average of 50 tonnes per annum
was destroyed during the second half of the 1990s.

Climate change refers to a statistically significant variation in

Defined in Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol, the Clean
Development Mechanism is intended to meet two objectives:
(1) to assist ~non-Annex I Parties in achieving sustainable de-
velopment and in contributing to the ultimate objective of the
convention; and (2) to assist Annex I Parties in achieving
compliance with their quantified emission limitation and reduc-
tion commitments. Certified emission reductions from Clean
Development Mechanism projects undertaken in non-Annex I
countries that limit or reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, when
certified by operational entities designated by the->Conference
of the Parties/Meeting of the Parties, can be accrued to the in-
vestor (government or industry) from Parties in ~Annex B. A
share of the proceeds from the certified project activities is used
to cover administrative expenses as well as to assist developing
country Parties that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse
effects of climate change to meet the costs of adaptation.

adjustment of the mass of a reservoir following a step change in

time, for a different definition pertinent to climate variations.
The term Jifetime is sometimes used, for simplicity, as a sur-

The response time or adjustment time is the time needed for
the climate system or its components to re-equilibrate to a
new state, following a forcing resulting from external or inter-
nal processes. Different components of the climate system can
have very different response times. The response time of the >
troposphere is relatively short, from days to weeks, whereas the
response time of the —stratosphere is typically a few months.
The oceans have much longer response times, of decades to
millennia, because of their large heat capacity. The response
time of the strongly coupled surface-troposphere system is
mainly determined by the oceans, and is therefore slow com-
pared with that of the stratosphere. The biosphere can respond
quickly, for example to droughts, but it can also respond very

slowly to other imposed changes.
