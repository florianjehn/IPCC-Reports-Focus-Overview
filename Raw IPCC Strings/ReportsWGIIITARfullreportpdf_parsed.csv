Global emissions diverge earlier and to a greater extent as stabiliza-

"2 Climate change in IPCC usage refers to any change in climate over
time, whether due to natural variability or as a result of human activ-
ity. This usage differs from that in the UNFCCC, where climate
change refers to a change of climate that is attributed directly or indi-
rectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global
atmosphere and that is in addition to natural climate variability
observed over comparable time periods.
"	Text
"* In this report “alternative development paths” refer to a variety of
possible scenarios for societal values and consumption and produc-
tion patterns in all countries, including but not limited to a continua-
tion of today’s trends. These paths do not include additional climate
initiatives which means that no scenarios are included that explicitly
assume implementation of the UNFCCC or the emission targets of the
Kyoto Protocol, but do include assumptions about other policies that
influence greenhouse gas emissions indirectly.
"	Text
"timing and costs of mitigation depend on different national cir-
cumstances and socio-economic, and technological develop-
ment paths and the desired level of greenhouse gas concentra-
tion stabilization in the atmosphere (see Figure SPM. for an
example for total CO, emissions). Development paths leading
to low emissions depend on a wide range of policy choices and
require major policy changes in areas other than climate
change (Sections 2.2.2, 2.3.2, 2.4.4, 2.5).
"	Text
"2. Climate change? is a problem with unique characteristics. It
is global, long-term (up to several centuries), and involves
complex interactions between climatic, environmental, eco-
nomic, political, institutional, social and technological process-
es. This may have significant international and intergenera-
tional implications in the context of broader societal goals such
as equity and sustainable development. Developing a response
to climate change is characterized by decision-making under
uncertainty and risk, including the possibility of non-linear
and/or irreversible changes (Sections 1.2.5, 1.3, 10.1.2, 10.1.4,
10.4.5).3
"	Text
"1. This report assesses the scientific, technical, environmental,
economic and social aspects of the mitigation of climate
change. Research in climate change mitigation! has continued
since the publication of the IPCC Second Assessment Report
(SAR), taking into account political changes such as the agree-
ment on the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1997, and is
reported on here. The Report also draws on a number of IPCC
Special Reports, notably the Special Report on Aviation and
the Global Atmosphere, the Special Report on Methodological
and Technological Issues in Technology Transfer (SRTT), the
Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES), and the
Special Report on Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry
(SRLULUCF).
"	Text
"4. Climate change mitigation will both be affected by, and have
impacts on, broader socio-economic policies and trends, such
as those relating to development, sustainability and equity.
Climate mitigation policies may promote sustainable develop-
ment when they are consistent with such broader societal
objectives. Some mitigation actions may yield extensive bene-
fits in areas outside of climate change: for example, they may
reduce health problems; increase employment; reduce negative
environmental impacts (like air pollution); protect and enhance
forests, soils and watersheds; reduce those subsidies and taxes
which enhance greenhouse gas emissions; and induce techno-
logical change and diffusion, contributing to wider goals of
sustainable development. Similarly, development paths that
meet sustainable development objectives may result in lower
levels of greenhouse gas emissions (Sections 1.3, 1.4, 2.2.3,
2.4.4, 2.5, 7.2.2, 8.2.4).
"	Text
"5. Differences in the distribution of technological, natural and
financial resources among and within nations and regions, and
between generations, as well as differences in mitigation costs,
are often key considerations in the analysis of climate change
mitigation options. Much of the debate about the future differ-
entiation of contributions of countries to mitigation and related
equity issues also considers these circumstances. The chal-
lenge of addressing climate change raises an important issue of
equity, namely the extent to which the impacts of climate
change or mitigation policies create or exacerbate inequities
both within and across nations and regions. Greenhouse gas
stabilization scenarios assessed in this report (except those
where stabilization occurs without new climate policies, e.g.
B1) assume that developed countries and countries with
economies in transition limit and reduce their greenhouse gas
emissions first.®

"6. Lower emissions scenarios require different patterns of
energy resource development. Figure SPM.2 compares the
cumulative carbon emissions between 1990 and 2100 for vari-
ous SRES scenarios to carbon contained in global fossil fuel
reserves and resources’. This figure shows that there are abun-

"7 Reserves are those occurrences that are identified and measured as
economically and technically recoverable with current technologies
and prices. Resources are those occurrences with less certain geolog-
ical and/or economic characteristics, but which are considered poten-
tially recoverable with foreseeable technological and economic devel-
opments. The resource base includes both categories. On top of that,
there are additional quantities with unknown certainty of occurrence
and/or with unknown or no economic significance in the foreseeable
future, referred to as “additional occurrences” (SAR, Working Group
Il). Examples of unconventional fossil fuel resources include tar
sands, shale oil, other heavy oil, coal bed methane, deep geopressured
gas, gas in acquifers, etc.
"	Text
"dant fossil fuel resources that will not limit carbon emissions
during the 21‘ century. However, different from the relatively
large coal and unconventional oil and gas deposits, the carbon
in proven conventional oil and gas reserves, or in convention-
al oil resources, is much less than the cumulative carbon emis-
sions associated with stabilization of carbon dioxide at levels
of 450 ppmv or higher (the reference to a particular concentra-
tion level does not imply an agreed-upon desirability of stabi-
lization at this level). These resource data may imply a change
in the energy mix and the introduction of new sources of ener-
gy during the 21*' century. The choice of energy mix and asso-
ciated investment will determine whether, and if so, at what
level and cost, greenhouse concentrations can be stabilized.
Currently most such investment is directed towards discover-
ing and developing more conventional and unconventional fos-
sil resources (Sections 2.5.1, 2.5.2, 3.8.3, 8.4).

"Figure SPM.1: Comparison of reference and stabilization scenarios. The figure is divided into six parts, one for each of the ref-
erence scenario groups from the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES, see Box SPM.1). Each part of the figure shows
the range of total global CO, emissions (gigatonnes of carbon (GtC)) from all anthropogenic sources for the SRES reference sce-
nario group (shaded in grey) and the ranges for the various mitigation scenarios assessed in the TAR leading to stabilization of
CO, concentrations at various levels (shaded in colour). Scenarios are presented for the Al family subdivided into three groups
(the balanced AIB group (Figure SPM.1a), non-fossil fuel AIT (Figure SPM.1b) and the fossil intensive AlFI (Figure SPM.Ic))
with stabilization of CO, concentrations at 450, 550, 650 and 750 ppmv; for the A2 group with stabilization at 550 and 750 ppmv
in Figure SPM.1d, the BI group with stabilization at 450 and 550 ppmv in Figure SPM.le, and the B2 group with stabilization
at 450, 550 and 650 ppmv in Figure SPM.1f. The literature is not available to assess 1000 ppnvw stabilization scenarios. The fig-
ure illustrates that the lower the stabilization level and the higher the baseline emissions, the wider the gap. The difference
between emissions in different scenario groups can be as large as the gap between reference and stabilization scenarios within
one scenario group. The dotted lines depict the boundaries of the ranges where they overlap.

equally sound.

"A2. The A2 storyline and scenario family describes a very heterogeneous world. The underlying theme is self-reliance and preserva-
tion of local identities. Fertility patterns across regions converge very slowly, which results in continuously increasing population.

Economic development is primarily regionally oriented and per capita economic growth and technological change more fragmented
and slower than other storylines.

"B1. The B1 storyline and scenario family describes a convergent world with the same global population, that peaks in mid-century
and declines thereafter, as in the Al storyline, but with rapid change in economic structures toward a service and information econo-
my, with reductions in material intensity and the introduction of clean and resource-efficient technologies. The emphasis is on global
solutions to economic, social and environmental sustainability, including improved equity, but without additional climate initiatives.

"B2. The B2 storyline and scenario family describes a world in which the emphasis is on local solutions to economic, social and envi-
ronmental sustainability. It is a world with continuously increasing global population, at a rate lower than A2, intermediate levels of
economic development, and less rapid and more diverse technological change than in the B1 and A1 storylines. While the scenario is
also oriented towards environmental protection and social equity, it focuses on local and regional levels.

"Al. The AJ storyline and scenario family describes a future world of very rapid economic growth, global population that peaks in mid-
century and declines thereafter, and the rapid introduction of new and more efficient technologies. Major underlying themes are con-
vergence among regions, capacity building and increased cultural and social interactions, with a substantial reduction in regional dif-
ferences in per capita income. The A1 scenario family develops into three groups that describe alternative directions of technological
change in the energy system. The three Al groups are distinguished by their technological emphasis: fossil intensive (A1FI), non-fos-
sil energy sources (A1T), or a balance across all sources (A1B) (where balanced is defined as not relying too heavily on one particu-
lar energy source, on the assumption that similar improvement rates apply to all energy supply and end use technologies).

"7. Significant technical progress relevant to greenhouse gas
emissions reduction has been made since the SAR in 1995 and
has been faster than anticipated. Advances are taking place in
a wide range of technologies at different stages of develop-
ment, e.g., the market introduction of wind turbines, the rapid
elimination of industrial by-product gases such as N,O from
adipic acid production and perfluorocarbons from aluminium
production, efficient hybrid engine cars, the advancement of
fuel cell technology, and the demonstration of underground
carbon dioxide storage. Technological options for emissions
reduction include improved efficiency of end use devices and
energy conversion technologies, shift to low-carbon and
renewable biomass fuels, zero-emissions technologies,
improved energy management, reduction of industrial by-prod-
uct and process gas emissions, and carbon removal and storage
(Section 3.1, 4.7).

Hundreds of technologies and practices for end-use
energy efficiency in buildings, transport and manufac-
turing industries account for more than half of this
potential (Sections 3.3, 3.4, 3.5).

At least up to 2020, energy supply and conversion will
remain dominated by relatively cheap and abundant
fossil fuels. Natural gas, where transmission is eco-
nomically feasible, will play an important role in emis-
sion reduction together with conversion efficiency
improvement, and greater use of combined cycle and/or
co-generation plants (Section 3.8.4).

Low-carbon energy supply systems can make an impor-
tant contribution through biomass from forestry and
agricultural by-products, municipal and industrial waste
to energy, dedicated biomass plantations, where suitable
Jand and water are available, landfill methane, wind
energy and hydropower, and through the use and lifetime
extension of nuclear power plants. After 2010, emissions
from fossil and/or biomass-fueled power plants could be
reduced substantially through pre- or post-combustion
carbon removal and storage. Environmental, safety, reli-
ability and proliferation concerns may constrain the use
of some of these technologies (Section 3.8.4).

"In agriculture, methane and nitrous oxide emissions can
be reduced, such as those from livestock enteric fer-
mentation, rice paddies, nitrogen fertilizer use and ani-
mal wastes (Section 3.6).

Depending on application, emissions of fluorinated
gases can be minimized through process changes,
improved recovery, recycling and containment, or
avoided through the use of alternative compounds and
technologies (Section 3.5 and Chapter 3 Appendix).

"Depending on the emissions scenario this could allow global
emissions to be reduced below 2000 levels in 2010-2020 at
these net direct costs. Realizing these reductions involve addi-
tional implementation costs, which in some cases may be sub-
stantial, the possible need for supporting policies (such as those
described in Paragraph 18), increased research and develop-
ment, effective technology transfer and overcoming other bar-
riers (Paragraph 17). These issues, together with costs and ben-

Half of these potential emissions reductions may be achieved
by 2020 with direct benefits (energy saved) exceeding direct
costs (net capital, operating, and maintenance costs), and the
other half at a net direct cost of up to US$1001C,, (at 1998
prices). These cost estimates are derived using discount rates in
the range of 5% to 12%, consistent with public sector discount

operation or pilot plant stage today, as referenced in the mitigation

"8. Forests, agricultural lands, and other terrestrial ecosystems
offer significant carbon mitigation potential. Although not nec-
essarily permanent, conservation and sequestration of carbon
may allow time for other options to be further developed and
implemented. Biological mitigation can occur by three strate-
gies: (a) conservation of existing carbon pools, (b) sequestra-
tion by increasing the size of carbon pools, and (c) substitution
of sustainably produced biological products, e.g. wood for
energy intensive construction products and biomass for fossil
fuels (Sections 3.6, 4.3). Conservation of threatened carbon
pools may help to avoid emissions, if leakage can be prevent-
ed, and can only become sustainable if the socio-economic dri-
vers for deforestation and other losses of carbon pools can be
addressed. Sequestration reflects the biological dynamics of
growth, often starting slowly, passing through a maximum, and
then declining over decades to centuries.
"	Text
"10. Social learning and innovation, and changes in institution-
al structure could contribute to climate change mitigation.
Changes in collective rules and individual behaviours may
have significant effects on greenhouse gas emissions, but take
place within a complex institutional, regulatory and legal set-
ting. Several studies suggest that current incentive systems can
encourage resource intensive production and consumption pat-
terns that increase greenhouse gas emissions in all sectors, e.g.
transport and housing. In the shorter term, there are opportuni-
ties to influence through social innovations individual and
organizational behaviours. In the longer term such innovations,
in combination with technological change, may further
enhance socio-economic potential, particularly if preferences
and cultural norms shift towards lower emitting and sustain-
able behaviours. These innovations frequently meet with resis-
tance, which may be addressed by encouraging greater public
participation in the decision-making processes. This can help
contribute to new approaches to sustainability and equity
(Sections 1.4.3, 5.3.8, 10.3.2, 10.3.4).
"	Text
"9. There is no single path to a low emission future and coun-
tries and regions will have to choose their own path. Most
model results indicate that known technological options®
could achieve a broad range of atmospheric CO, stabilization
levels, such as 5SOppmv, 450ppmv or below over the next 100
years or more, but implementation would require associated
socio-economic and institutional changes. To achieve stabi-
lization at these levels, the scenarios suggest that a very signif-
icant reduction in world carbon emissions per unit of GDP
from 1990 levels will be necessary. Technological improve-
ment and technology transfer play a critical role in the stabi-
lization scenarios assessed in this report. For the crucial ener-
gy sector, almost all greenhouse gas mitigation and concentra-
tion stabilization scenarios are characterized by the introduc-
tion of efficient technologies for both energy use and supply,
and of low- or no-carbon energy. However, no single technol-
ogy option will provide all of the emissions reductions needed.
Reduction options in non-energy sources and non-CO, green-
house gases will also provide significant potential for reducing
emissions. Transfer of technologies between countries and
regions will widen the choice of options at the regional level
and economies of scale and learning will lower the costs of
their adoption (Sections 2.3.2, 2.4, 2.5).
"	Text
"Conservation and sequestration result in higher carbon stocks,
but can lead to higher future carbon emissions if these ecosys-
tems are severely disturbed by either natural or direct/indirect
human-induced disturbances. Even though natural distur-
bances are normally followed by re-sequestration, activities to
manage such disturbances can play an important role in limit-
ing carbon emissions. Substitution benefits can, in principle,
continue indefinitely. Appropriate management of land for
crop, timber and sustainable bio-energy production, may
increase benefits for climate change mitigation. Taking into
account competition for land use and the SAR and SRLU-
LUCE assessments, the estimated global potential of biological
mitigation options is in the order of 100GtC (cumulative),
although there are substantial uncertainties associated with this
estimate, by 2050, equivalent to about 10% to 20% of potential
fossil fuel emissions during that period. Realization of this
potential depends upon land and water availability as well as
the rates of adoption of different land management practices.
The largest biological potential for atmospheric carbon mitiga-
tion is in subtropical and tropical regions. Cost estimates
reported to date of biological mitigation vary significantly
from US$0.1/tC to about US$20/tC in several tropical coun-
tries and from US$20/tC to US$LO0/tC in non-tropical coun-
tries. Methods of financial analysis and carbon accounting have
not been comparable. Moreover, the cost calculations do not
cover, in many instances, inter alia, costs for infrastructure,
appropriate discounting, monitoring, data collection and imple-
mentation costs, opportunity costs of land and maintenance, or
other recurring costs, which are often excluded or overlooked.
The lower end of the ranges are biased downwards, but under-
standing and treatment of costs is improving over time. These

environmental benefits beyond reductions in atmospheric CO,,

"For a variety of factors, significant differences and uncertainties surround specific quantitative estimates of the costs and benefits of
mitigation options. The SAR described two categories of approaches to estimating costs and benefits: bottom-up approaches, which
build up from assessments of specific technologies and sectors, such as those described in Paragraph 7, and top-down modelling stud-
ies, which proceed from macroeconomic relationships, such as those discussed in Paragraph 13. These two approaches lead to differ-
ences in the estimates of costs and benefits, which have been narrowed since the SAR. Even if these differences were resolved, other
uncertainties would remain. The potential impact of these uncertainties can be usefully assessed by examining the effect of a change
in any given assumption on the aggregate cost results, provided any correlation between variables is adequately dealt with.

"exploit no regrets opportunities (Sections 7.3.4, 9.2.1):

Market imperfections. Reduction of existing market or
institutional failures and other barriers that impede
adoption of cost-effective emission reduction mea-
sures, can lower private costs compared to current prac-
tice. This can also reduce private costs overall.
Ancillary benefits. Climate change mitigation mea-
sures will have effects on other societal issues. For
example, reducing carbon emissions in many cases
will result in the simultaneous reduction in local and
regional air pollution. It is likely that mitigation strate-
gies will also affect transportation, agriculture, land-
use practices and waste management and will have an
impact on other issues of social concern, such as
employment, and energy security. However, not all of
the effects will be positive; careful policy selection and
design can better ensure positive effects and minimize
negative impacts. In some cases, the magnitude of
ancillary benefits of mitigation may be comparable to
the costs of the mitigating measures, adding to the no
regrets potential, although estimates are difficult to
make and vary widely (Sections 7.3.3, 8.2.4, 9.2.2-
9.2.8, 9.2.10).

Double dividend. Instruments (such as taxes or auc-
tioned permits) provide revenues to the government. If
used to finance reductions in existing distortionary
taxes (“revenue recycling”), these revenues reduce the
economic cost of achieving greenhouse gas reductions.
The magnitude of this offset depends on the existing
tax structure, type of tax cuts, labour market conditions,
and method of recycling. Under some circumstances, it
is possible that the economic benefits may exceed the
costs of mitigation (Sections 7.3.3, 8.2.2. 9.2.1).

between Annex B countries, the estimated reductions in 2010
are between 0.1% and 1.1% of projected GDP'>. These studies
encompass a wide range of assumptions as listed in Paragraph
11. Models whose results are reported in this paragraph assume
full use of emissions trading without transaction cost. Results for
cases that do not allow Annex B trading assume full domestic
trading within each region. Models do not include sinks or non-

"14. Cost-effectiveness studies with a century timescale esti-
mate that the costs of stabilizing CO, concentrations in the
atmosphere increase as the concentration stabilization level
declines. Different baselines can have a strong influence on
absolute costs. While there is a moderate increase in the costs
when passing from a 750ppmv to a 550ppmv concentration
stabilization level, there is a larger increase in costs passing
from 550ppmyv to 450ppmv unless the emissions in the base-
line scenario are very low. These results, however, do not
incorporate carbon sequestration, gases other than CO, and
did not examine the possible effect of more ambitious targets

each concentration level depend on numerous factors includ-
ing the rate of discount, distribution of emission reductions
over time, policies and measures employed, and particularly
the choice of the baseline scenario: for scenarios character-

"15. Under any greenhouse gas mitigation effort, the economic
costs and benefits are distributed unevenly between sectors; to
a varying degree, the costs of mitigation actions could be
reduced by appropriate policies. In general, it is easier to iden-
tify activities, which stand to suffer economic costs compared
to those which may benefit, and the economic costs are more
immediate, more concentrated and more certain. Under mitiga-
tion policies, coal, possibly oil and gas, and certain energy-
intensive sectors, such as steel production, are most likely to
suffer an economic disadvantage. Other industries including
renewable energy industries and services can be expected to
benefit in the long term from price changes and the availabili-
ty of financial and other resources that would otherwise have
been devoted to carbon-intensive sectors. Policies such as the
removal of subsidies from fossil fuels may increase total soci-
etal benefits through gains in economic efficiency, while use of
the Kyoto mechanisms could be expected to reduce the net
economic cost of meeting Annex B targets. Other types of poli-
cies, for example exempting carbon-intensive industries, redis-
tribute the costs but increase total societal costs at the same
time. Most studies show that the distributional effects of a car-
bon tax can have negative income effects on low-income
groups unless the tax revenues are used directly or indirectly to
compensate such effects (Section 9.2.1).
"	Text
"The effects on these countries can be further reduced by
removal of subsidies for fossil fuels, energy tax restruc-
turing according to carbon content, increased use of
natural gas, and diversification of the economies of
non-Annex I, oil-exporting countries.

Other non-Annex I countries: They may be adversely
affected by reductions in demand for their exports to
OECD nations and by the price increase of those car-
bon-intensive and other products they continue to
import. These countries may benefit from the reduction
in fuel prices, increased exports of carbon-intensive
products and the transfer of environmentally sound
technologies and know-how. The net balance for a
given country depends on which of these factors domi-
nates. Because of these complexities, the breakdown of
winners and losers remains uncertain.

Carbon leakage”. The possible relocation of some car-
bon-intensive industries to non-Annex I countries and
wider impacts on trade flows in response to changing
prices may lead to leakage in the order of 5%-20%
(Section 8.3.2.2). Exemptions, for example for energy-
intensive industries, make the higher model estimates
for carbon leakage unlikely, but would raise aggregate
costs. The transfer of environmentally sound technolo-
gies and know-how, not included in models, may lead
to lower leakage and especially on the longer term may
more than offset the leakage.

"21. Climate change decision-making is essentially a sequential
process under general uncertainty. The literature suggests that
a prudent risk management strategy requires a careful consid-
eration of the consequences (both environmental and econom-
ic), their likelihood and society’s attitude toward risk. The lat-
ter is likely to vary from country to country and perhaps even
from generation to generation. This report therefore confirms
the SAR finding that the value of better information about cli-
mate change processes and impacts and society’s responses to
them is likely to be great. Decisions about near-term climate
policies are in the process of being made while the concentra-
tion stabilization target is still being debated. The literature
suggests a step-by-step resolution aimed at stabilizing green-
house gas concentrations. This will also involve balancing the
risks of either insufficient or excessive action. The relevant
question is not “what is the best course for the next 100 years”,
but rather “what is the best course for the near term given the
expected long-term climate change and accompanying uncer-
tainties” (Section 10.4.3).

"18. National responses to climate change can be more effective
if deployed as a portfolio of policy instruments to limit or
reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The portfolio of national cli-
mate policy instruments may include - according to national
circumstances - emissions/carbon/energy taxes, tradable or
non-tradable permits, provision and/or removal of subsidies,
deposit/refund systems, technology or performance standards,
energy mix requirements, product bans, voluntary agreements,
government spending and investment, and support for research
and development. Each government may apply different eval-
uation criteria, which may lead to different portfolios of instru-
ments. The literature in general gives no preference for any
particular policy instrument. Market based instruments may be
cost-effective in many cases, especially where capacity to
administer them is developed. Energy efficiency standards and
performance regulations are widely used, and may be effective
in many countries, and sometimes precede market based
instruments. Voluntary agreements have recently been used
more frequently, sometimes preceding the introduction of more
stringent measures. Information campaigns, environmental
labelling, and green marketing, alone or in combination with
incentive subsidies, are increasingly emphasized to inform and
shape consumer or producer behaviour. Government and/or
privately supported research and development is important in
advancing the long-term application and transfer of mitigation
technologies beyond the current market or economic potential

suit by comprehensively describing, cataloguing, and compar-

this process by including recent analyses of climate change that
place policy evaluations in the context of sustainable develop-
ment. This expansion of scope is consistent both with the evo-
lution of the literature on climate change and the importance
accorded by the UNFCCC to sustainable development - includ-
ing the recognition that “Parties have a right to, and should pro-
mote sustainable development” (Art. 3.4). It therefore goes
some way towards filling the gaps in earlier assessments.

"After the publication of the SAR, continued research in the
area of mitigation of climate change, which was partly influ-
enced by political changes such as the adoption of the Kyoto
Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1997, has been undertaken and
is reported on here. The report also draws on a number of IPCC
Special Reports! and IPCC co-sponsored meetings and Expert
Meetings that were held in 1999 and 2000, particularly to sup-
port the development of the IPCC TAR. This summary follows
the 10 chapters of the report.

"In 1998, Working Group (WG) III of the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was charged by the IPCC
Plenary for the Panel’s Third Assessment Report (TAR) to
assess the scientific, technical, environmental, economic, and
social aspects of the mitigation of climate change. Thus, the
mandate of the Working Group was changed from a predomi-
nantly disciplinary assessment of the economic and social
dimensions on climate change (including adaptation) in the
Second Assessment Report (SAR), to an interdisciplinary
assessment of the options to control the emissions of green-
house gases (GHGs) and/or enhance their sinks.
"	Text
"This chapter places climate change mitigation, mitigation pol-
icy, and the contents of the rest of the report in the broader con-
text of development, equity, and sustainability. This context
reflects the explicit conditions and principles laid down by the
UNFCCC on the pursuit of the ultimate objective of stabilizing
greenhouse gas concentrations. The UNFCCC imposes three
conditions on the goal of stabilization: namely that it should
take place within a time-frame sufficient to “allow ecosystems
to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food pro-
duction is not threatened and to enable economic development
to proceed in a sustainable manner” (Art. 2). It also specifies
several principles to guide this process: equity, common but
differentiated responsibilities, precaution, cost-effective mea-
sures, right to sustainable development, and support for an
open international economic system (Art. 3).

"Climate change involves complex interactions between climat-
ic, environmental, economic, political, institutional, social, and
technological processes. It cannot be addressed or compre-
hended in isolation of broader societal goals (such as equity or
sustainable development), or other existing or probable future
sources of stress. In keeping with this complexity, a multiplic-
ity of approaches have emerged to analyze climate change and
related challenges. Many of these incorporate concerns about
development, equity, and sustainability (DES) (albeit partially
and gradually) into their framework and recommendations.
Each approach emphasizes certain elements of the problem,
and focuses on certain classes of responses, including for
example, optimal policy design, building capacity for design-
ing and implementing policies, strengthening synergies
between climate change mitigation and/or adaptation and other
societal goals, and policies to enhance societal learning. These
approaches are therefore complementary rather than mutually
exclusive.
"	Text
"This chapter brings together three broad classes of analysis,
which differ not so much in terms of their ultimate goals as of
their points of departure and preferred analytical tools. The
three approaches start with concerns, respectively, about effi-
ciency and cost-effectiveness, equity and sustainable develop-
ment, and global sustainability and societal learning. The dif-
ference between the three approaches selected lies in their
starting point not in their ultimate goals. Regardless of the
starting point of the analysis, many studies try in their own way
to incorporate other concerns. For example, many analyses that
approach climate change mitigation from a cost-effectiveness
perspective try to bring in considerations of equity and sus-
tainability through their treatment of costs, benefits, and wel-
fare. Similarly, the class of studies that are motivated strongly
by considerations of inter-country equity tend to argue that
equity is needed to ensure that developing countries can pursue
their internal goals of sustainable development—a concept that
includes the implicit components of sustainability and efficien-
cy. Likewise, analysts focused on concerns of global sustain-
ability have been compelled by their own logic to make a case
for global efficiency—often modelled as the decoupling of pro-
duction from material flows—and social equity. In other words,
each of the three perspectives has led writers to search for ways
to incorporate concerns that lie beyond their initial starting
point. All three classes of analyses look at the relationship of
climate change mitigation with all three goals—development,
equity, and sustainability—albeit in different and often highly
complementary ways. Nevertheless, they frame the issues dif-

ferent tools of analysis, and often come to somewhat different
conclusions.
"	Text
"There is no presumption that any particular perspective for
analysis is most appropriate at any level. Moreover, the three
perspectives are viewed here as being highly synergistic. The
important changes have been primarily in the types of ques-
tions being asked and the kinds of information being sought.
In practice, the literature has expanded to add new issues and
new tools, subsuming rather than discarding the analyses
included in the other perspectives. The range and scope of cli-
mate policy analyses can be understood as a gradual broaden-
ing of the types and extent of uncertainties that analysts have
been willing and able to address.
"	Text
"Extending discussions of how nations might respond to the mit-
igation challenge so that they include issues of cost-effective-
ness and efficiency, distribution narrowly defined, equity more
broadly defined, and sustainability, adds enormous complexity
to the problem of uncovering how best to respond to the threat
of climate change. Indeed, recognizing that these multiple
domains are relevant complicates the task assigned to policy-
makers and international negotiators by opening their delibera-
tions to issues that lie beyond the boundaries of the climate
change problem, per se. Their recognition thereby underlines
the importance of integrating scientific thought across a wide
range of new policy-relevant contexts, but not simply because of
some abstract academic or narrow parochial interest advanced
by asmall set of researchers or nations. Cost-effectiveness, equi-
ty, and sustainability have all been identified as critical issues by
the drafters of the UNFCCC, and they are an integral part of the

"The third perspective is global sustainability and societal learn-
ing. While sustainability has been incorporated in the analyses
in a number of ways, a class of studies takes the issue of glob-
al sustainability as their point of departure. These studies focus
on alternative pathways to pursue global sustainability and
address issues like decoupling growth from resource flows, for
example through eco-intelligent production systems, resource
light infrastructure and appropriate technologies, and decou-
pling wellbeing from production, for example through inter-
mediate performance levels, regionalization of production sys-
tems, and changing lifestyles. One popular method for identi-
fying constraints and opportunities within this perspective is to
identify future sustainable states and then examine possible
transition paths to those states for feasibility and desirability. In
the case of developing countries this leads to a number of pos-
sible strategies that can depart significantly from those which
the developed countries pursued in the past.

"demonstrating the sensitivity of some equity measures to poli-
cy design, national perspective, and regional context. Indeed,
cost-effectiveness analyses had even highlighted similar sensi-
tivities for other measures of development and sustainability.
As mentioned, the analyses that start from equity concerns
have by and large focused on the needs of developing coun-
tries, and in particular on the commitment expressed in Article
3.4 of the UNFCCC to the pursuit of sustainable development.
Countries differ in ways that have dramatic implications for
scenario baselines and the range of mitigation options that can
be considered. The climate policies that are feasible, and/or
desirable, in a particular country depend significantly on its
available resources and institutions, and on its overall objec-
tives including climate change as but one component.
Recognizing this heterogeneity may, thus, lead to a different
range of policy options than has been considered likely thus far
and may reveal differences in the capacities of different sectors
that may also enhance appreciation of what can be done by
non-state actors to improve their ability to mitigate.
"	Text
"The impetus for the expansion in the scope of the climate pol-
icy analysis and discourse to include equity considerations was
to address not simply the impacts of climate change and miti-
gation policies on global welfare as a whole, but also of the
effects of climate change and mitigation policies on existing
inequalities among and within nations. The literature on equity
and climate change has advanced considerably over the last
two decades, but there is no consensus on what constitutes fair-
ness. Once equity issues were introduced into the assessment
agenda, though, they became important components in defin-
ing the search for efficient emissions mitigation pathways. The
considerable literature that indicated how environmental poli-
cies could be hampered or even blocked by those who consid-
ered them unfair became relevant. In light of these results, it
became clear how and why any widespread perception that a
mitigation strategy is unfair would likely engender opposition
to that strategy, perhaps to the extent of rendering it non-opti-
mal (or even infeasible, as could be the case if non-Annex I
countries never participate). Some cost-effectiveness analyses
had, in fact, laid the groundwork for applying this literature by

"The first perspective on climate policy analysis is cost effec-
tiveness. It represents the field of conventional climate policy
analysis that is well represented in the First through Third
Assessments. These analyses have generally been driven
directly or indirectly by the question of what is the most cost-
effective amount of mitigation for the global economy starting
from a particular baseline GHG emissions projection, reflect-
ing a specific set of socio-economic projections. Within this
framework, important issues include measuring the perfor-
mance of various technologies and the removal of barriers
(such as existing subsidies) to the implementation of those can-
didate policies most likely to contribute to emissions reduc-
tions. In a sense, the focus of analysis here has been on identi-
fying an efficient pathway through the interactions of mitiga-
tion policies and economic development, conditioned by con-
siderations of equity and sustainability, but not primarily guid-
ed by them. At this level, policy analysis has almost always
taken the existing institutions and tastes of individuals as
given; assumptions that might be valid for a decade or two, but
may become more questionable over many decades.

"3 In this report sometimes the term “co-benefits” is also used to indi-
cate the additional benefits of policy options that are implemented for
various reasons at the same time, acknowledging that most policies
designed to address GHG mitigation also have other, often at least
equally important, rationales, e.g., related to objectives of develop-
ment, sustainability and equity. The benefits of avoided climate change
are not covered in ancillary or co-benefits. See also Section 7.2.

"Each mitigation scenario describes a particular future world,
with particular economic, social, and environmental character-
istics, and they therefore implicitly or explicitly contain infor-
mation about DES. Since the difference between reference case
scenarios and stabilization and mitigation scenarios is simply
the addition of deliberate climate policy, it can be the case that
the differences in emissions among different reference case
scenarios are greater than those between any one such scenario
and its stabilization or mitigation version.

"The term “ancillary benefits” is often used in the literature for
the ancillary, or secondary, effects of climate change mitigation
policies on problems other than GHG emissions, such as reduc-
tions in local and regional air pollution, associated with the
reduction of fossil fuels, and indirect effects on issues such as
transportation, agriculture, land use practices, biodiversity
preservation, employment, and fuel security. Sometimes these
are referred to as “ancillary impacts”, to reflect the fact that in
some cases the benefits may be negative*. The concept of “mit-

"In order to be effective, however, a portfolio approach requires
weighing the costs and impacts of the broader set of policies
according to a longer list of objectives. Climate deliberations
need to consider the climate ramifications of policies designed
primarily to address a wide range of issues including DES, as
well as the likely impacts of climate policies on the achievement
of these objectives. As part of this process the opportunity costs
and impacts of each instrument are measured against the multi-
ple criteria defined by these multiple objectives. Furthermore,
the number of decision makers or stakeholders to be considered
is increased beyond national policymakers and international
negotiators to include state, local, community, and household
agents, as well as non-government organizations (NGOs).
"	Text
"The literature being brought to bear on climate change mitiga-
tion increasingly shows that policies lying beyond simply
reducing GHG emissions from a specified baseline to mini-
mize costs can be extremely effective in abating the emission
of GHGs. Therefore, a portfolio approach to policy and analy-
sis would be more effective than exclusive reliance on a nar-
row set of policy instruments or analytical tools. Besides the
flexibility that an expanded range of policy instruments and
analytical tools can provide to policymakers for achieving cli-
mate objectives, the explicit inclusion of additional policy
objectives also increases the likelihood of “buy-in” to climate
policies by more participants. In particular, it will expand the
range of no regrets” options. Finally, it could assist in tailoring
policies to short-, medium-, and long-term goals.

"igative capacity” is also introduced as a possible way to inte-
grate results derived from the application of the three perspec-
tives in the future. The determinants of the capacity to mitigate
climate change include the availability of technological and
policy options, and access to resources to underwrite undertak-
ing those options. These determinants are the focus of much of
the TAR. The list of determinants is, however, longer than this.
Mitigative capacity also depends upon nation-specific charac-
teristics that facilitate the pursuit of sustainable development —
e.g., the distribution of resources, the relative empowerment of
various segments of the population, the credibility of empow-
ered decision makers, the degree to which climate objectives
complement other objectives, access to credible information
and analyses, the will to act on that information, the ability to
spread risk intra- and inter-generationally, and so on. Given that
the determinants of mitigative capacity are essentially the same
as those of the analogous concept of adaptive capacity intro-
duced in the WGII Report, this approach may provide an inte-
grated framework for assessing both sets of options.

"Based on the type of mitigation, the scenarios fall into four cat-
egories: concentration stabilization scenarios, emission stabi-
lization scenarios, safe emission corridor scenarios, and other
mitigation scenarios. All the reviewed scenarios include ener-
gy-related carbon dioxide (CO,) emissions; several also
include CO, emissions from land-use changes and industrial
processes, and other important GHGs.

"Only a small set of studies has reported on scenarios for miti-
gating non-CO, gases. This literature suggests that small
reductions of GHG emissions can be accomplished at lower
cost by including non-CO, gases; that both CO, and non-CO,
emissions would have to be controlled in order to slow the
increase of atmospheric temperature sufficiently to achieve cli-
mate targets assumed in the studies; and that methane (CH,)
mitigation can be carried out more rapidly, with a more imme-
diate impact on the atmosphere, than CO, mitigation.
"	Text
"A survey of this literature has yielded a number of insights that
are relevant to GHG emissions scenarios and sustainable
development. First, a wide range of future conditions has been
identified by futurists, ranging from variants of sustainable
development to collapse of social, economic, and environmen-
tal systems. Since future values of the underlying socio-eco-
nomic drivers of emissions may vary widely, it is important
that climate policies should be designed so that they are
resilient against widely different future conditions.
"	Text
"Policy options used in the reviewed mitigation scenarios take
into account energy systems, industrial processes, and land use,
and depend on the underlying model structure. Most of the sce-
narios introduce simple carbon taxes or constraints on emis-
sions or concentration levels. Regional targets are introduced
in the models with regional disaggregation. Emission permit
trading is introduced in more recent work. Some models
employ policies of supply-side technology introduction, while
others emphasize efficient demand-side technology.

"Second, the global futures scenarios that show falling GHG

to a post-industrial (service-based) economy; population tends

"Global futures scenarios do not specifically or uniquely con-
sider GHG emissions. Instead, they are more general “stories”
of possible future worlds. They can complement the more
quantitative emissions scenario assessments, because they con-
sider dimensions that elude quantification, such as governance
and social structures and institutions, but which are nonethe-
less important to the success of mitigation policies. Addressing
these issues reflects the different perspectives presented in
Section 1: cost-effectiveness and/or efficiency, equity, and sus-
tainability.

"There is a wide range in baselines, reflecting a diversi-
ty of assumptions, mainly with respect to economic
growth and low-carbon energy supply. High economic
growth scenarios tend to assume high levels of progress
in the efficiency of end-use technologies; however, car-

future trends shows greater divergence in scenarios that
focus on developing countries than in scenarios that
look at developed nations. There is little consensus with
respect to future directions in developing regions.

The reviewed 550ppmv stabilization scenarios vary
with respect to reduction time paths and the distribution

ferences in per capita income. The A1 scenario family develops into three groups that describe alternative directions of technological
change in the energy system. The three Al groups are distinguished by their technological emphasis: fossil intensive (A1FI), non-fos-
sil energy sources (AIT), or a balance across all sources (A1B) (where balanced is defined as not relying too heavily on one particu-
lar energy source, on the assumption that similar improvement rates apply to all energy supply and end-use technologies).

"""he SRES scenarios lead to the following findings:

Alternative combinations of driving-force variables can
lead to similar levels and structure of energy use, land-
use patterns, and emissions.

Important possibilities for further bifurcations in future
development trends exist within each scenario family.
Emissions profiles are dynamic across the range of
SRES scenarios. They portray trend reversals and indi-
cate possible emissions cross-over among different sce-
narios.

Describing potential future developments involves
inherent ambiguities and uncertainties. One and only
one possible development path (as alluded to, for
instance, in concepts such as “business-as-usual sce-
nario”) simply does not exist. The multi-model
approach increases the value of the SRES scenario set,
since uncertainties in the choice of model input assump-
tions can be more explicitly separated from the specific
model behaviour and related modelling uncertainties.

model that was used. The post-SRES scenarios cover a very
wide range of emission trajectories, but the range is clearly

reduction over time. Energy reduction shows a much wider
range than CO, reduction, because in many scenarios a decou-

participation of developing countries in emission mitigation. A
preliminary finding of the post-SRES scenario analysis is that,
if it is assumed that the CO, emission reduction needed for
stabilization occurs in Annex I countries only, Annex I per
capita CO, emissions would fall below non-Annex I per capi-
ta emissions during the 21% century in nearly all of the stabi-

"A key policy question is what kind of emission reductions in
the medium term (after the Kyoto Protocol commitment peri-
od) would be needed. Analysis of the post-SRES scenarios
(most of which assume developing country emissions to be
below baselines by 2020) suggests that stabilization at 450
ppmv will require emissions reductions in Annex I countries
after 2012 that go significantly beyond their Kyoto Protocol
commitments. It also suggests that it would not be necessary to
go much beyond the Kyoto commitments for Annex I by 2020
to achieve stabilization at 550ppmv or higher. However, it
should be recognized that several scenarios indicate the need
for significant Annex I emission reductions by 2020 and that
none of the scenarios introduces other constraints such as a
limit to the rate of temperature change.

CO, concentrations at 450, 550, 650 and 750ppnw, for the A2 group with stabilization at 550 and 750ppmv in Figure TS-2d, the
B1 group and stabilization at 450 and 550ppmv in Figure TS-2e, and the B2 group including stabilization at 450, 550, and
650ppmv in Figure TS-2f. The literature is not available to assess 1000ppnw stabilization scenarios. The figure illustrates that
the lower the stabilization level and the higher the baseline emissions, the wider the gap. The difference between emissions in
different scenario groups can be as large as the gap between reference and stabilization scenarios within one scenario group.

lifestyle choices that may improve quality of life, while at the

"Running counter to the technological and economic potential
for GHG emissions reduction are rapid economic development
and accelerating change in some socio-economic and behav-
ioural trends that are increasing total energy use, especially in
developed countries and high-income groups in developing
countries. Dwelling units and vehicles in many countries are
growing in size, and the intensity of electrical appliance use is
increasing. Use of electrical office equipment in commercial
buildings is increasing. In developed countries, and especially
the USA, sales of larger, heavier, and less efficient vehicles are
also increasing. Continued reduction or stabilization in retail
energy prices throughout large portions of the world reduces
incentives for the efficient use of energy or the purchase of
energy efficient technologies in all sectors. With a few impor-
tant exceptions, countries have made little effort to revitalize
policies or programmes to increase energy efficiency or pro-
mote renewable energy technologies. Also since the early
1990s, there has been a reduction in both public and private
resources devoted to R&D (research and development) to
develop and implement new technologies that will reduce
GHG emissions.

advancement of wind turbine design, demonstration of under-
ground carbon dioxide storage, and the near elimination of
N,O emissions from adipic acid production. Greater energy
efficiency opportunities for buildings, industry, transportation,
and energy supply are available, often at a lower cost than was
expected. By the year 2010 most of the opportunities to reduce
emissions will still come from energy efficiency gains in the
end-use sectors, by switching to natural gas in the electric
power sector, and by reducing the release of process GHGs
from industry, e.g., NO, perfluoromethane (CF,), and HFCs.
By the year 2020, when a proportion of the existing power
plants will have been replaced in developed countries and
countries with economies in transition (EITs), and when many
new plants will become operational in developing countries,
the use of renewable sources of energy can begin contributing
to the reduction of CO, emissions. In the longer term, nuclear
energy technologies — with inherent passive characteristics
meeting stringent safety, proliferation, and waste storage goals
— along with physical carbon removal and storage from fossil
fuels and biomass, followed by sequestration, could potential-
ly become available options.
"	Text
"Technologies and practices to reduce GHG emissions are con-
tinuously being developed. Many of these technologies focus
on improving the efficiency of fossil fuel energy or electricity
use and the development of low carbon energy sources, since
the majority of GHG emissions (in terms of CO, equivalents)
are related to the use of energy. Energy intensity (energy con-
sumed divided by gross domestic product (GDP)) and carbon
intensity (CO, emitted from burning fossil fuels divided by the
amount of energy produced) have been declining for more than
100 years in developed countries without explicit government
policies for decarbonization, and have the potential to decline
further. Much of this change is the result of a shift away from
high carbon fuels such as coal towards oil and natural gas,
through energy conversion efficiency improvements and the
introduction of hydro and nuclear power. Other non-fossil fuel
energy sources are also being developed and rapidly imple-
mented and have a significant potential for reducing GHG
emissions. Biological sequestration of CO, and CO, removal
and storage can also play a role in reducing GHG emissions in
the future (see also Section 4 below). Other technologies and
measures focus on the non-energy sectors for reducing emis-
sions of the remaining major GHGs: CH,, nitrous oxide (N,O),
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sul-
phur hexafluoride (SF,).

"by the SRES without any specific GHG emission policies fore-
see cumulative release ranging from approximately 1,000 GtC

2,100. Cumulative carbon emissions for stabilization profiles
of 450 to 750 ppmv over that same period are between 630 and
1,300GtC (see Figure TS.5). Fossil-fuel scarcity, at least at the
global level, is therefore not a significant factor in considering
climate change mitigation. On the contrary, different from the
relatively large coal and unconventional oil and gas deposits,
the carbon in conventional oil and gas reserves or in conven-
tional oil resources is much less than the cumulative carbon
emissions associated with stabilisation at 450 ppmv or higher
(Figure TS.5). In addition, there is the potential to contribute
large quantities of other GHGs as well. At the same time it is
clear from Figure TS.5 that the conventional oil and gas
reserves are only a small fraction of the total fossil fuel
resource base. These resource data may imply a change in the
energy mix and the introduction of new sources of energy dur-
ing the 21* century. The choice of energy mix and associated
investment will determine whether, and if so at what level and
cost, greenhouse concentrations can be stabilized. Currently
most such investment is directed towards discovering and
developing more conventional and unconventional fossil

"The buildings sector contributed 31% of global energy-related

ment of building controls, passive solar design, integrated

buildings. Fluorocarbon emissions from refrigeration and air
conditioning applications have declined as chlorofluorocar-
bons (CFCs) have been phased out, primarily thanks to
improved containment and recovery of the fluorocarbon refrig-
erant and, to a lesser extent, owing to the use of hydrocarbons
and other non-fluorocarbon refrigerants. Fluorocarbon use and

"been phased out, and are projected to decline further as HCFCs
are phased out. R&D effort has led to increased efficiency of
refrigerators and cooling and heating systems. In spite of the
continued improvement in technology and the adoption of
improved technology in many countries, energy use in build-
ings has grown more rapidly than total energy demand from
1971 through 1995, with commercial building energy register-
ing the greatest annual percentage growth (3.0% compared to
2.2% in residential buildings). This is largely a result of the
increased amenity that consumers demand — in terms of
increased use of appliances, larger dwellings, and the modern-
ization and expansion of the commercial sector — as economies
grow. There presently exist significant cost-effective techno-
logical opportunities to slow this trend. The overall technical
potential for reducing energy-related CO, emissions in the
buildings sector using existing technologies combined with
future technical advances is 715MtC/yr in 2010 for a base case
with carbon emissions of 2,600MtC/yr (27%), 9SOMtC/yr in

(31%), and 2,025MtC/yr in 2050 for a base case with carbon

"In 1995, the transport sector contributed 22% of global energy-
related carbon dioxide emissions; globally, emissions from this
sector are growing at a rapid rate of approximately 2.5% annu-
ally. Since 1990, principal growth has been in the developing
countries (7.3% per year in the Asia—Pacific region) and is
actually declining at a rate of 5.0% per year for the EITs.
Hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles have been introduced on a
commercial basis with fuel economies 50%-100% better than
those of comparably sized four-passenger vehicles. Biofuels
produced from wood, energy crops, and waste may also play an
increasingly important role in the transportation sector as enzy-
matic hydrolysis of cellulosic material to ethanol becomes
more cost effective. Meanwhile, biodiesel, supported by tax
exemptions, is gaining market share in Europe. Incremental
improvements in engine design have, however, largely been
used to enhance performance rather than to improve fuel econ-
omy, which has not increased since the SAR. Fuel cell powered
vehicles are developing rapidly, and are scheduled to be intro-
duced to the market in 2003. Significant improvements in the
fuel economy of aircraft appear to be both technically and eco-
nomically possible for the next generation fleet. Nevertheless,
most evaluations of the technological efficiency improvements
(Table TS.3) show that because of growth in demand for trans-
portation, efficiency improvement alone is not enough to avoid
GHG emission growth. Also, there is evidence that, other
things being equal, efforts to improve fuel efficiency have only
partial effects in emission reduction because of resulting
increases in driving distances caused by lower specific opera-
tional costs.

"The nuclear power industry has managed to increase signifi-
cantly the capacity factor at existing facilities, which improved
their economics sufficiently that extension of facility life has
become cost effective. But other than in Asia, relatively few
new plants are being proposed or built. Efforts to develop
intrinsically safe and less expensive nuclear reactors are pro-
ceeding with the goal of lowering socio-economic barriers and
reducing public concern about safety, nuclear waste storage,
and proliferation. Except for a few large projects in India and
China, construction of new hydropower projects has also
slowed because of few available major sites, sometimes-high
costs, and local environmental and social concerns. Another
development is the rapid growth of wind turbines, whose annu-
al growth rate has exceeded 25% per year, and by 2000 exceed-
ed 13GW of installed capacity. Other renewables, including
solar and biomass, continue to grow as costs decline, but total

wherever adequate natural gas supply and infrastructure are

kt or 17OMtC,,/yr by 2010, while PFC production is expected
to be less than 12McC, ,/yr. For the year 2010, annual emissions
are more difficult to estimate. The largest emissions are likely
to be associated with mobile air conditioning followed by com-
mercial refrigeration and stationary air conditioning. HFC use
in foam blowing is currently low, but if HFCs replaces a sub-

"Global emissions of GHGs grew on average by 1.4% per year
during the period 1990 to 1998. In many areas, technical
progress relevant to GHG emission reduction since the SAR has
been significant and faster than anticipated. The total potential
for worldwide GHG emissions reductions resulting from tech-
nological developments and their adoption amount to 1,900 to
2,600MtC/yr by 2010, and 3,600 to 5,050MtC/yr by 2020. The
evidence on which this conclusion is based is extensive, but has
several limitations. No comprehensive worldwide study of
technological potential has yet been done, and the existing
regional and national studies generally have varying scopes and
make different assumptions about key parameters. Therefore,
the estimates as presented in Table TS.1 should be considered to
be indicative only. Nevertheless, the main conclusion in the
paragraph above can be drawn with high confidence.

"Costs of options vary by technology and show regional differ-
ences. Half of the potential emissions reductions may be
achieved by 2020 with direct benefits (energy saved) exceeding
direct costs (net capital, operating, and maintenance costs), and
the other half at a net direct cost of up to US$1001C,, (at 1998
prices). These cost estimates are derived using discount rates in
the range of 5% to 12%, consistent with public sector discount
rates. Private internal rates of return vary greatly, and are often
significantly higher, which affects the rate of adoption of these
technologies by private entities. Depending on the emissions
scenario this could allow global emissions to be reduced below
2000 levels in 2010-2020 at these net direct costs. Realizing
these reductions will involve additional implementation costs,
which in some cases may be substantial, and will possibly need
supporting policies (such as those described in Section 6),

"Physical removal and storage of CO, is potentially a more
viable option than at the time of the SAR. The use of coal or
biomass as a source of hydrogen with storage of the waste CO,
represents a possible step to the hydrogen economy. CO, has
been stored in an aquifer, and the integrity of storage is being
monitored. However, long-term storage is still in the process of
being demonstrated for that particular reservoir. Research is
also needed to determine any adverse and/or beneficial envi-
ronmental impacts and public health risks of uncontrolled
release of the various storage options. Pilot CO, capture and
storage facilities are expected to be operational by 2010, and
may be capable of making major contributions to mitigation by
2020. Along with biological sequestration, physical removal
and storage might complement current efforts at improving
efficiency, fuel switching, and the development of renewables,
but must be able to compete economically with them.

"The report considers the potential for mitigation technologies in
this sector to reduce CO, emissions to 2020 from new power
plants. CCGTs are expected to be the largest provider of new
capacity between now and 2020 worldwide, and will be a strong
competitor to displace new coal-fired power stations where addi-
tional gas supplies can be made available. Nuclear power has the
potential to reduce emissions if it becomes politically acceptable,
as it can replace both coal and gas for electricity production.
Biomass, based mainly on wastes and agricultural and forestry
by-products, and wind power are also potentially capable of
making major contributions by 2020. Hydropower is an estab-
lished technology and further opportunities exist beyond those
anticipated to contribute to reducing CO, equivalent emissions.
Finally, while costs of solar power are expected to decline sub-
stantially, it is likely to remain an expensive option by 2020 for
central power generation, but it is likely to make increased con-
tributions in niche markets and off-grid generation. The best mit-
igation option is likely to be dependent on local circumstances,
and a combination of these technologies has the potential to
reduce CO, emissions by 350-700MtC by 2020 compared to pro-
jected emissions of around 4,00MtC from this sector.

but the impacts of these changes will vary by geographical
region, ecosystem type, and local abilities to adapt. For exam-
ple, increases in atmospheric CO,, changes in climate, modi-

"Appropriate policies are required to realize these potentials.
Furthermore, on-going research and development is expected
to significantly widen the portfolio of technologies that provide

"Conservation and sequestration allow time for other options to
be further developed and implemented. The IPCC SAR esti-
mated that about 60 to 87GtC could be conserved or
sequestered in forests by the year 2050 and another 23 to
44GtC could be sequestered in agricultural soils. The current
assessment of the potential of biological mitigation options is
in the order of 100GtC (cumulative) by 2050, equivalent to
about 10% to 20% of projected fossil fuel emissions during
that period. In this section, biological mitigation measures in
terrestrial ecosystems are assessed, focusing on the mitigation
potential, ecological and environmental constraints, econom-
ics, and social considerations. Also, briefly, the so-called geo-
engineering options are discussed.
"	Text
"Increased carbon pools through the management of terrestrial
ecosystems can only partially offset fossil fuel emissions.
Moreover, larger C stocks may pose a risk for higher CO,
emissions in the future, if the C-conserving practices are dis-
continued. For example, abandoning fire control in forests, or
reverting to intensive tillage in agriculture may result in a rapid
loss of at least part of the C accumulated during previous years.
However, using biomass as a fuel or wood to displace more
energy-intensive materials can provide permanent carbon mit-
igation benefits. It is useful to evaluate terrestrial sequestration
opportunities alongside emission reduction strategies, as both
approaches will likely be required to control atmospheric CO,
levels.
"	Text
"Carbon reservoirs in most ecosystems eventually approach
some maximum level. The total amount of carbon stored and/or
carbon emission avoided by a forest management project at any
given time is dependent on the specific management practices
(see Figure TS.6). Thus, an ecosystem depleted of carbon by
past events may have a high potential rate of carbon accumula-
tion, while one with a large carbon pool tends to have a low rate
of carbon sequestration. As ecosystems eventually approach
their maximum carbon pool, the sink (i.e., the rate of change of
the pool) will diminish. Although both the sequestration rate
and pool of carbon may be relatively high at some stages, they
cannot be maximized simultaneously. Thus, management
strategies for an ecosystem may depend on whether the goal is
to enhance short-term accumulation or to maintain the carbon
reservoirs through time. The ecologically achievable balance
between the two goals is constrained by disturbance history, site
productivity, and target time frame. For example, options to
maximize sequestration by 2010 may not maximize sequestra-
tion by 2020 or 2050; in some cases, maximizing sequestration
by 2010 may lead to lower carbon storage over time.

"Hundreds of technologies and practices exist to reduce GHG
emissions from the buildings, transport, and industry sectors.
These energy efficiency options are responsible for more than
half of the total emission reduction potential of these sectors.
Efficiency improvements in material use (including recycling)
will also become more important in the longer term. The ener-
gy supply and conversion sector will remain dominated by
cheap and abundant fossil fuels. However, there is significant
emission reduction potential thanks to a shift from coal to nat-
ural gas, conversion efficiency improvement of power plants,
the expansion of distributed co-generation plants in industry,
commercial buildings and institutions, and CO, recovery and
sequestration. The continued use of nuclear power plants
(including their lifetime extension), and the application of
renewable energy sources could avoid some additional emis-
sions from fossil fuel use. Biomass from by-products and
wastes such as landfill gas are potentially important energy
sources that can be supplemented by energy crop production
where suitable land and water are available. Wind energy and
hydropower will also contribute, more so than solar energy
because of its relatively high costs. N,O and fluorinated GHG
reductions have already been achieved through major techno-
logical advances. Process changes, improved containment and
recovery, and the use of alternative compounds and technolo-
gies have been implemented. Potential for future reductions
exists, including process-related emissions from insulated foam
and semiconductor production and by-product emissions from
aluminium and HCFC-22. The potential for energy efficiency
improvements connected to the use of fluorinated gases is of a
similar magnitude to reductions of direct emissions. Soil carbon
sequestration, enteric CH, control, and conservation tillage can
all contribute to mitigating GHG emissions from agriculture.

increasing C stocks is but one of many objectives. Often, mea-
sures can be adopted within forestry, agriculture, and other
land uses to provide C mitigation and, at the same time, also
advance other social, economic, and environmental goals.
Carbon mitigation can provide additional value and income to
land management and rural development. Local solutions and
targets can be adapted to priorities of sustainable development
at national, regional, and global levels.
"	Text
"A key to making C mitigation activities effective and sustainable
is to balance it with other ecological and/or environmental, eco-
nomic, and social goals of land use. Many biological mitigation
strategies may be neutral or favourable for all three goals and
become accepted as “no regrets” or “win-win” solutions. In other
cases, compromises may be needed. Important potential environ-
mental impacts include effects on biodiversity, effects on amount
and quality of water resources (particularly where they are
already scarce), and long-term impacts on ecosystem productiv-
ity. Cumulative environmental, economic, and social impacts
could be assessed in individual projects and also from broader,
national and international perspectives. An important issue is
“leakage” — an expanded or conserved C pool in one area lead-
ing to increased emissions elsewhere. Social acceptance at the
local, national, and global levels may also influence how effec-
tively mitigation policies are implemented.
"	Text
"In the past, land management has often resulted in reduced C
pools, but in many regions like Western Europe, C pools have
now stabilized and are recovering. In most countries in tem-
perate and boreal regions forests are expanding, although cur-
rent C pools are still smaller than those in pre-industrial or pre-
historic times. While complete recovery of pre-historic C pools
is unlikely, there is potential for substantial increases in carbon
stocks. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the
UN Economic Commission for Europe (ECE)’s statistics sug-
gest that the average net annual increment exceeded timber
fellings in managed boreal and temperate forests in the early
1990s. For example, C stocks in live tree biomass have
increased by 0.17GtC/yr in the USA and 0.11GtC/yr in
Western Europe, absorbing about 10% of global fossil CO,
emissions for that time period. Though these estimates do not
include changes in litter and soils, they illustrate that land sur-
faces play a significant and changing role in the atmospheric
carbon budget. Enhancing these carbon pools provides poten-
tially powerful opportunities for climate mitigation.

roles in carbon mitigation: they act as a carbon reservoir; they
can replace construction materials that require more fossil fuel

climate mitigation, but if infrastructures and incentives can be

"Marine ecosystems may also offer possibilities for removing
CO, from the atmosphere. The standing stock of C in the
marine biosphere is very small, however, and efforts could
focus, not on increasing biological C stocks, but on using bios-
pheric processes to remove C from the atmosphere and trans-
port it to the deep ocean. Some initial experiments have been
performed, but fundamental questions remain about the per-
manence and stability of C removals, and about unintended
consequences of the large-scale manipulations required to have
a significant impact on the atmosphere. In addition, the eco-
nomics of such approaches have not yet been determined.

"Geo-engineering involves efforts to stabilize the climate sys-
tem by directly managing the energy balance of the earth,
thereby overcoming the enhanced greenhouse effect. Although
there appear to be possibilities for engineering the terrestrial
energy balance, human understanding of the system is still
rudimentary. The prospects of unanticipated consequences are
large, and it may not even be possible to engineer the regional
distribution of temperature, precipitation, etc. Geo-engineering
raises scientific and technical questions as well as many ethi-
cal, legal, and equity issues. And yet, some basic inquiry does
seem appropriate.
"	Text
"Most studies suggest that the economic costs of some biologi-
cal carbon mitigation options, particularly forestry options, are
quite modest through a range. Cost estimates of biological mit-
igation reported to date vary significantly from US$0.1/tC to
about US$20/tC in several tropical countries and from US$20
to US$LOO/tC in non-tropical countries. Moreover the cost cal-
culations do not cover, in many instances, inter alia, costs for
infrastructure, appropriate discounting, monitoring, data col-
lection and interpretation, and opportunity costs of land and
maintenance, or other recurring costs, which are often exclud-
ed or overlooked. The lower end of the ranges are biased
downwards, but understanding and treatment of costs is
improving over time. Furthermore, in many cases biological
mitigation activities may have other positive impacts, such as
protecting tropical forests or creating new forests with positive
external environmental effects. However, costs rise as more
biological mitigation options are exercised and as the opportu-
nity costs of the land increases. Biological mitigation costs
appear to be lowest in developing countries and higher in
developed countries. If biological mitigation activities are
modest, leakage is likely to be small. However, the amount of
leakage could rise if biological mitigation activities became
large and widespread.

"Of course, elimination of all these market and institutional
barriers would not produce technology diffusion at the level of
the “technical potential”. The remaining barriers, which define
the gap between economic potential and technical potential,
are usefully placed in two groups separated by a socio-eco-
nomic potential. The first group consists of barriers derived
from people’s preferences and other social and cultural barri-
ers to the diffusion of new technology. That is, even if market
and institutional barriers are removed, some GHG-mitigating
technologies may not be widely used simply because people
do not like them, are too poor to afford them, or because exist-
ing social and cultural forces operate against their acceptance.
If, in addition to overcoming market and institutional barriers,
this second group of barriers could be overcome, what is
labelled as the “socio-economic potential” would be achieved.
"	Text
"Technological and social innovation is a complex process of
research, experimentation, learning, and development that can
contribute to GHG mitigation. Several theories and models
have been developed to understand its features, drivers, and
implications. New knowledge and human capital may result
from R&D spending, through learning by doing, and/or in an
evolutionary process. Most innovations require some social or
behavioural change on the part of users. Rapidly changing
economies, as well as social and institutional structures offer
opportunities for locking in to GHG-mitigative technologies
that may lead countries on to sustainable development path-
ways. The pathways will be influenced by the particular socio-
economic context that reflects prices, financing, international
trade, market structure, institutions, the provision of informa-
tion, and social, cultural, and behavioural factors; key elements
of these are described below.
"	Text
"An issue arises as to how to treat the relative environmental
costs of different technologies within this framework. Because
the purpose of the exercise is ultimately to identify opportuni-
ties for global climate change policies, the technology poten-
tials are defined without regard to GHG impacts. Costs and
benefits associated with other environmental impacts would be
part of the cost-effectiveness calculation underlying economic
potential only insofar as existing environmental regulations or
policies internalize these effects and thereby impose them on
consumers. Broader impacts might be ignored by consumers,
and hence not enter into the determination of economic poten-
tial, but they would be incorporated into a social cost-effec-
tiveness calculation. Thus, to the extent that other environmen-
tal benefits make certain technologies socially cost-effective,
even if they are not cost-effective from a consumer’s point of
view, the GHG benefits of diffusion of such technologies
would be incorporated in the socio-economic potential.
"	Text
"The transfer of technologies and practices that have the poten-
tial to reduce GHG emissions is often hampered by barriers!”
that slow their penetration. The opportunity! to mitigate GHG
concentrations by removing or modifying barriers to or other-
wise accelerating the spread of technology may be viewed
within a framework of different potentials for GHG mitigation
(Figure TS.7). Starting at the bottom, one can imagine address-
ing barriers (often referred to as market failures) that relate to
markets, public policies, and other institutions that inhibit the
diffusion of technologies that are (or are projected to be) cost-
effective for users without reference to any GHG benefits they
may generate. Amelioration of this class of “market and insti-
tutional imperfections” would increase GHG mitigation
towards the level that is labelled as the “economic potential”.
The economic potential represents the level of GHG mitigation
that could be achieved if all technologies that are cost-effective
from the consumers’ point of view were implemented. Because
economic potential is evaluated from the consumer’s point of
view, we would evaluate cost-effectiveness using market prices
and the private rate of time discounting, and also take into
account consumers’ preferences regarding the acceptability of
the technologies’ performance characteristics.

tions in order to delay or even prevent the arrival of new inno-
vations that might destroy their rents.

Another important barrier is uncertainty. A consumer may be
uncertain about future energy prices and, therefore, future
energy savings. Also, there may be uncertainty about the next
generation of equipment — will next year bring a cheaper or
better model? In practical decision making, a barrier is often
associated with the issue of sunk cost and long lifetimes of
infrastructure, and the associated irreversibilities of invest-
ments of the non-fungible infrastructure capita.

"Distorted or incomplete prices are also important barriers. The
absence of a market price for certain impacts(externalities),
such as environmental harm, constitutes a barrier to the diffu-
sion of environmentally beneficial technologies. Distortion of
prices because of taxes, subsidies, or other policy interventions
that make resource consumption more or less expensive to
consumers also impedes the diffusion of resource-conserving
technologies.

"Network externalities can generate barriers. Some technologies
operate in such a way that a given user’s equipment interacts
with the equipment of other users so as to create “network
externalities”. For example, the attractiveness of vehicles using
alternative fuels depends on the availability of convenient refu-
elling sites. On the other hand, the development of a fuel dis-

alternative fuel vehicles.

"Information is often considered as a public good. Generic
information regarding the availability of different kinds of
technologies and their performance characteristics may have
the attributes of a “public good” and hence may be underpro-
vided by the private market. This problem is exacerbated by
the fact that even after a technology is in place and being used,
it is often difficult to quantify the energy savings that resulted
from its installation owing to measurement errors and the dif-
ficulty with baseline problems. Knowing that this uncertainty
will prevail can itself inhibit technology diffusion.

"In some situations policy development is based on a model of
human psychology that has been widely criticized. People are
assumed to be rational welfare-maximizers and to have a fixed
set of values. Such a model does not explain processes, such as
learning, habituation, value formation, or the bounded ratio-
nality, observed in human choice. Social structures can affect
consumption, for example, through the association of objects
with status and class. Individuals’ adoption of more sustainable
consumption patterns depends not only on the match between
those patterns and their perceived needs, but also on the extent
to which they understand their consumption options, and are
able to make choices.

short-term outlook of private investors, and the perceived risks

barriers in this sector are lack of skills and social barriers, mis-

less on cars, but it is not easy, even taking congestion problems
into account, to motivate the shift away from suburban sprawl
to compact cities as advocated in some literature. An integrat-
ed approach to town and transport planning and the use of
incentives are key to energy efficiency and saving in the trans-
port sector. This is an area, where lock-in effects are very
important: when land-use patterns have been chosen there is
hardly a way back. This represents an opportunity in particular
for the developing world.

"Industry: In industry, barriers may take many forms, and are
determined by the characteristics of the firm (size and struc-

ciency measures are often not undertaken as a result of lack of
information and high transaction costs for obtaining reliable
information. Capital is used for competing investment priori-
ties, and is subject to high hurdle rates for energy efficiency
investments. Lack of skilled personnel, especially for small
and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), leads to difficulties
installing new energy-efficient equipment compared to the
simplicity of buying energy. Other barriers are the difficulty of
quantifying energy savings and slow diffusion of innovative
technology into markets, while at the same time firms typical-
ly underinvest in R&D, despite the high rates of return on
investment.

energy planning (production, distribution, and end-use), and
accelerated R&D. Affordable credit financing is widely recog-
nized in Africa as one of the critical measures to remove the
high first-cost barrier. Poor macroeconomic management cap-

"A country committed to a limit on its GHG emissions also can
meet this limit by implementing a tradable permit system that
directly or indirectly limits emissions of domestic sources.
Like a tax, a tradable permit system poses a number of design
issues, including type of permit, ways to allocate permits,
sources included, point of compliance, and use of banking. To
be able to cover all sources with a single domestic permit
regime is unlikely. The certainty provided by a tradable permit
system of achieving a given emissions level for participating
sources comes at the cost of the uncertainty of permit prices
(and hence compliance costs). To address this concern, a
hybrid policy that caps compliance costs could be adopted, but
the level of emissions would no longer be guaranteed.

"Market-based instruments — principally domestic taxes and
domestic tradable permit systems — will be attractive to gov-
ernments in many cases because they are efficient. They will
frequently be introduced in concert with conventional regula-

policymakers must consider the collection point, the tax base,
the variation among sectors, the association with trade,
employment, revenue, and the exact form of the mechanism.
Each of these can influence the appropriate design of a domes-
tic emissions tax, and political or other concerns are likely to
play a role as well. For example, a tax levied on the energy
content of fuels could be much more costly than a carbon tax
for equivalent emissions reduction, because an energy tax rais-
es the price of all forms of energy, regardless of their contribu-

changes in social welfare based on individual values. These
individual values are reflected by the willingness to pay (WTP)

to the non-climate benefits of GHG mitigation policies that are
explicitly incorporated into the initial creation of mitigation
policies. Thus, the term co-benefits reflects that most policies
designed to address GHG mitigation also have other, often at
least equally important, rationales involved at the inception of
these policies (e.g., related to objectives of development, sus-
tainability, and equity). In contrast, the term ancillary benefits

necessary simplification to gain traction on an immense and
complex issue. As a consequence, the costs of risk reduction
action are frequently estimated separately, and therefore each
measure is potentially biased. This realization suggests that
more attention to the interaction of mitigation and adaptation,

prescriptive approach based on what rates of discount should
be applied, and a descriptive approach based on what rates of
discount people (savers as well as investors) actually apply in
their day-to-day decisions. For mitigation analysis, the country
must base its decisions at least partly on discount rates that
reflect the opportunity cost of capital. Rates that range from
4% to 6% would probably be justified in developed countries.
The rate could be 10-12% or even higher in developing coun-
tries. It is more of a challenge to argue that climate change mit-
igation projects should face different rates, unless the mitiga-
tion project is of very long duration. The literature shows
increasing attention to rates that decline over time and hence
give more weight to benefits that occur in the long term. Note
that these rates do not reflect private rates of return, which typ-

addition to the primary aim of improving the environment (the
first dividend), such policies, if conducted through revenue-

permits, yield a second dividend, which can be set against the
gross costs of these policies. All domestic GHG policies have
an indirect economic cost from the interactions of the policy
instruments with the fiscal system, but in the case of revenue-
raising policies this cost is partly offset (or more than offset) if,
for example, the revenue is used to reduce existing distor-
tionary taxes. Whether these revenue-raising policies can
reduce distortions in practice depends on whether revenues can
be “recycled” to tax reduction.

such policies and measures should take into account different socio-
economic contexts, be comprehensive, cover all relevant sources,
sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases and adaptation, and com-

"This leads to contrasting two generic approaches, namely the
engineering-economics approach and least-cost equilibrium
modelling. In the first approach, each technology is assessed
independently via an accounting of its costs and savings. Once
these elements have been estimated, a unit cost can be calcu-
lated for each action, and each action can be ranked according
to its costs. This approach is very useful to point out the poten-
tials for negative cost abatements due to the ‘efficiency gap’
between the best available technologies and technologies cur-
rently in use. However, its most important limitation is that
studies neglect or do not treat in a systematic way the interde-
pendence of the various actions under examination.

"As discussed in Section 6, the main categories of climate
change mitigation policies include: market-oriented policies,
technology-oriented policies, voluntary policies, and research
and development policies. Climate change mitigation policies
can include all four of the above policy elements. Most analyt-
ical approaches, however, only consider some of the four ele-
ments. Economic models, for example, mainly assess market-
oriented policies and in some cases technology policies pri-
marily those related to energy supply options, while engineer-
ing approaches mainly focus on supply and demand side tech-
nology policies. Both of these approaches are relatively weak
in the representation of research and development and volun-
tary agreement policies.

"However, the modelling results show considerable variations
from study to study, which are explained by a number of fac-
tors, some of which reflect the widely differing conditions that
prevail in the countries studied (e.g., energy endowment, eco-
nomic growth, energy intensity, industrial and trade structure),
and others reflect modelling assumptions and assumptions
about negative cost potentials.

"However, as in the SAR, there is agreement on a no regrets
potential resulting from the reduction of existing market imper-
fections, consideration of ancillary benefits, and inclusion of
double dividends. This means that some mitigation actions can
be realized at negative costs. The no regrets potential results
from existing market or institutional imperfections that prevent
cost-effective emission reduction measures from being taken.
The key question is whether such imperfections can be
removed cost-effectively by policy measures.
"	Text
"The second important policy message is that short and medium
term marginal abatement costs, which govern most of the
macroeconomic impacts of climate policies, are very sensitive
to uncertainty regarding baseline scenarios (rate of growth and
energy intensity) and technical costs. Even with significant
negative cost options, marginal costs may rise quickly beyond
a certain anticipated mitigation level. This risk is far lower in
models allowing for carbon trading. Over the long term this
risk is reduced as technical change curbs down the slope of
marginal cost curves.
"	Text
"Partial equilibrium least-costs models have been constructed to
remedy this defect, by considering all actions simultaneously
and selecting the optimal bundle of actions in all sectors and at
all time periods. These more integrated studies conclude high-
er total costs of GHG mitigation than the strict technology by
technology studies. Based on an optimization framework they
give very easily interpretable results that compare an optimal
response to an optimal baseline; however, their limitation is
that they rarely calibrate the base year of the model to the exist-
ing non optimal situation and implicitly assume an optimal
baseline. They consequently provide no information about the
negative cost potentials.

"With no international emission trading, the carbon taxes neces-

US$645, and finally for the rest of OECD (CANZ) between
US$46 and US$425. All numbers are reported in 1990 dollars.
Marginal abatement costs are in the range of US$20-
US$135/tC if international trading is allowed. These models do
not generally include no regrets measures or take account of

"The above studies assume, to allow an easy comparison across
countries, that the revenues from carbon taxes (or auctioned
emissions permits) are recycled in a lump-sum fashion to the
economy. The net social cost resulting from a given marginal
cost of emissions constraint can be reduced if the revenues are
targetted to finance cuts in the marginal rates of pre-existing
distortionary taxes, such as income, payroll, and sales taxes.
While recycling revenues in a lump-sum fashion confers no
efficiency benefit, recycling through marginal rate cuts helps
avoid some of the efficiency costs or dead-weight loss of exist-
ing taxes. This raises the possibility that revenue-neutral car-
bon taxes might offer a double dividend by (1) improving the
environment and (2) reducing the costs of the tax system.

"In a multi-model comparison project that engaged more than a
dozen modelling teams internationally, the gross costs of com-
plying with the Kyoto Protocol were examined, using energy
sector models. Carbon taxes are implemented to lower emis-
sions and the tax revenue is recycled lump sum. The magnitude
of the carbon tax provides a rough indication of the amount of
market intervention that would be needed and equates the mar-
ginal abatement cost to meet a prescribed emissions target. The
size of the tax required to meet a specific target will be deter-
mined by the marginal source of supply (including conserva-
tion) with and without the target. This in turn will depend on
such factors as the size of the necessary emissions reductions,
assumptions about the cost and availability of carbon-based
and carbon-free technologies, the fossil fuel resource base, and
short- and long-term price elasticities.

"One can distinguish a weak and a strong form of the double
dividend. The weak form asserts that the costs of a given rev-
enue-neutral environmental reform, when revenues are devot-
ed to cuts in marginal rates of prior distortionary taxes, are
reduced relative to the costs when revenues are returned in
lump-sum fashion to households or firms. The strong form of
the double-dividend assertion is that the costs of the revenue-
neutral environmental tax reform are zero or negative. While
the weak form of the double-dividend claim receives virtually
universal support, the strong form of the double dividend asser-

double dividend can be obtained, in any case more frequently

increased wages and favours those who earn their income
mainly from labour. However, the poorest groups in the society

"The calculation is made by various models with both global
and regional detail. In each instance, the goal is to meet the
emission reduction targets contained in the Kyoto Protocol. All
of the models show significant gains as the size of the trading
market is expanded. The difference among models is due in
part to differences in their baseline, the assumptions about the
cost and availability of low-cost substitutes on both the supply
and demand sides of the energy sector, and the treatment of
short-term macro shocks. In general, all calculated gross costs
for the non-trading case are below 2% of GDP (which is
assumed to have increased significantly in the period consid-

costs for the OECD region as a whole to less than 0.5% and
regional impacts within this vary between 0.1% to 1.1%.
Global trading in general would decrease these costs to well
below 0.5% of GDP with OECD average below 0.2%.

benefit estimation — the computable general equilibrium (CGE)
models — have difficulty in estimating ancillary benefits
because they rarely have, and may not be able to have, the nec-
essary spatial detail.

"As to the trade effects, the dominant finding of the effects of
emission constraints in Annex B countries on non-Annex B
countries in simulation studies prior to the Kyoto Protocol was
that Annex B abatement would have a predominantly adverse
impact on non-Annex B regions. In simulations of the Kyoto
Protocol, the results are more mixed with some non-Annex B
regions experiencing welfare gains and other losses. This is
mainly due to a milder target in the Kyoto simulations than in
pre-Kyoto simulations. It was also universally found that most
non-Annex B economies that suffered welfare losses under
uniform independent abatement would suffer smaller welfare
losses under emissions trading.

"A constraint would lead to a reallocation of resources away
from the pattern that is preferred in the absence of a limit and
into potentially costly conservation and fuel substitution.
Relative prices will also change. These forced adjustments lead
to reductions in economic performance, which impact GDP.
Clearly, the broader the permit trading market, the greater the
opportunity for reducing overall mitigation costs. Conversely,
limits on the extent to which a country can satisfy its obliga-
tions through the purchase of emissions quota can increase mit-
igation costs. Several studies have calculated the magnitude of
the increase to be substantial falling in particular on countries
with the highest marginal abatement costs. But another para-
meter likely to limit the savings from carbon trading is the very
functioning of trading systems (transaction costs, management
costs, insurance against uncertainty, and strategic behaviour in
the use of permits).

"With respect to baseline considerations most of the literature
on ancillary benefits systematically treats only government
policies and regulations with respect to the environment. In
contrast, other regulatory policy baseline issues, such as those
relating to energy, transportation, and health, have been gener-
ally ignored, as have baseline issues that are not regulatory,
such as those tied with technology, demography, and the natur-
al resource base. For the studies reviewed here, the biggest
share of the ancillary benefits is related to public health. A
major component of uncertainty for modelling ancillary bene-
fits for public health is the link between emissions and atmos-
pheric concentrations, particularly in light of the importance of
secondary pollutants. However, it is recognized that there are
significant ancillary benefits in addition to those for public
health that have not been quantified or monetized. At the same
time, it appears that there are major gaps in the methods and
models for estimating ancillary costs.

"Policies aimed at mitigating greenhouse gases can have posi-
tive and negative side effects on society, not taking into
account benefits of avoided climate change. This section
assesses in particular those studies that evaluate the side effects
of climate change mitigation. Therefore the term “ancillary
benefits or costs” is used. There is little agreement on the def-
inition, reach, and size of these ancillary benefits, and on
methodologies for integrating them into climate policy.
Criteria are established for reviewing the growing literature
linking specific carbon mitigation policies to monetized ancil-
lary benefits. Recent studies that take an economy-wide, rather
than a sectoral, approach to ancillary benefits are described in
the report and their credibility is examined (Chapter 9 presents
sectoral analyses). In spite of recent progress in methods devel-
opment, it remains very challenging to develop quantitative
estimates of the ancillary effects, benefits and costs of GHG
mitigation policies. Despite these difficulties, in the short term,
ancillary benefits of GHG policies under some circumstances
can be a significant fraction of private (direct) mitigation costs
and in some cases they can be comparable to the mitigation
costs. According to the literature, ancillary benefits may be of
particular importance in developing countries, but this litera-

leakage”, and can occur in the order of 5%-20% through a pos-
sible relocation of carbon-intensive industries because of
reduced Annex B competitiveness in the international market-
place, lower producer prices of fossil fuels in the international
market, and changes in income due to better terms of trade.

"Carbon leakage may also be influenced by the assumed degree
of competitiveness in the world oil market. While most studies
assume a competitive oil market, studies considering imperfect
competition find lower leakage if OPEC is able to exercise a
degree of market power over the supply of oil and therefore
reduce the fall in the international oil price. Whether or not
OPEC acts as a cartel can have a reasonably significant effect
on the loss of wealth to OPEC and other oil producers and on
the level of permit prices in Annex B regions (see also Section

"While the SAR reported that there was a high variance in esti-

the development of new models based on reasonably similar
assumptions and data sources. Such developments do not nec-
essarily reflect more widespread agreement about appropriate
behavioural assumptions. One robust result seems to be that
carbon leakage is an increasing function of the stringency of
the abatement strategy. This means that leakage may be a less
serious problem under the Kyoto target than under the more
stringent targets considered previously. Also emission leakage
is lower under emissions trading than under independent

"For studies that assume that the target is known, the issue is
one of identifying the least-cost mitigation pathway for achiev-

seen as a carbon budget problem. This problem has been so far
addressed in terms of CO, only and very limited treatment has
been given to non-CO, GHGs. A concentration target defines
an allowable amount of carbon to be emitted into the atmos-
phere between now and the date at which the target is to be
achieved. The issue is how best to allocate the carbon budget
over time.

"Cost-effectiveness studies with a century timescale estimate
that the costs of stabilizing CO, concentrations in the atmos-

Different baselines can have a strong influence on absolute
costs. While there is a moderate increase in the costs when
passing from a 750ppmv to a 550ppmv concentration stabi-
lization level, there is a larger increase in costs passing from
550ppmv to 450ppmv unless the emissions in the baseline sce-
nario are very low. These results, however, do not incorporate
carbon sequestration and gases other than CO,, and did not
examine the possible effect of more ambitious targets on
induced technological change’. In particular, the choice of the
reference scenario has a strong influence. Recent studies using
the IPCC SRES reference scenarios as baselines against which
to analyze stabilization clearly show that the average reduction
in projected GDP in most of the stabilization scenarios

"reviewed here is under 3% of the baseline value (the maximum
reduction across all the stabilization scenarios reached 6.1% in
a given year). At the same time, some scenarios (especially in
the A1T group) showed an increase in GDP compared to the
baseline because of apparent positive economic feedbacks of
technology development and transfer. The GDP reduction
(averaged across storylines and stabilization levels) is lowest in
2020 (1%), reaches a maximum in 2050 (1.5%), and declines
by 2100 (1.3%). However, in the scenario groups with the
highest baseline emissions (A2 and A1FI), the size of the GDP
reduction increases throughout the modelling period. Due to
their relatively small scale when compared to absolute GDP
levels, GDP reductions in the post-SRES stabilization scenar-
ios do not lead to significant declines in GDP growth rates over
this century. For example, the annual 1990-2100 GDP growth
rate across all the stabilization scenarios was reduced on aver-

countries, and therefore tend to overstate both the costs
to these countries and overall costs.

The effects on these countries can be further reduced by
removal of subsidies for fossil fuels, energy tax restruc-
turing according to carbon content, increased use of
natural gas, and diversification of the economies of
non-Annex I, oil-exporting countries.

Other non-Annex I countries: They may be adversely
affected by reductions in demand for their exports to
OECD nations and by the price increase of those car-
bon-intensive and other products they continue to
import. These countries may benefit from the reduction
in fuel prices, increased exports of carbon-intensive
products and the transfer of environmentally sound
technologies and know-how. The net balance for a
given country depends on which of these factors domi-
nates. Because of these complexities, the breakdown of
winners and losers remains uncertain.

Carbon leakage:?* The possible relocation of some car-
bon-intensive industries to non-Annex I countries and
wider impacts on trade flows in response to changing
prices may lead to leakage in the order of 5-20%.
Exemptions, for example for energy-intensive indus-
tries, make the higher model estimates for carbon leak-
age unlikely, but would raise aggregate costs. The
transfer of environmentally sound technologies and
know-how, not included in models, may lead to lower
leakage and especially on the longer term may more
than offset the leakage.

the smaller the carbon budget, and hence the earlier the depar-

require future capital stock to be less carbon-intensive. This
has immediate implications for near-term investment deci-

location of the losses, and to identify the sectors that may ben-

make this assessment is limited: there are few comprehensive

"Recent research suggests that the effect on timing depends on
the source of technological change. When the channel for
technological change is R&D, the induced technological
change makes it preferable to concentrate more abatement
efforts in the future. The reason is that technological change
lowers the costs of future abatement relative to current abate-
ment, making it more cost-effective to place more emphasis on
future abatement. But, when the channel for technological
change is learning-by-doing, the presence of induced techno-
logical change has an ambiguous impact on the optimal timing
of abatement. On the one hand, induced technical change
makes future abatement less costly, which suggests emphasiz-
ing future abatement efforts. On the other hand, there is an
added value to current abatement because such abatement con-
tributes to experience or learning and helps reduce the costs of
future abatement. Which of these two effects dominates

"Thus, studies show a wide range of estimates for the impact of
GHG mitigation policies on oil production and revenue. Much
of these differences are attributable to the assumptions made
about: the availability of conventional oil reserves, the degree
of mitigation required, the use of emission trading, control of
GHGs other than CO,, and the use of carbon sinks. However,
all studies show a net growth in both oil production and rev-
enue to at least 2020, and significantly less impact on the real
price of oil than has resulted from market fluctuations over the
past 30 years. Figure TS.9 shows the projection of real oil

"Within this broad picture, certain sectors will be substantially
affected by mitigation. Relative to the reference case, the coal
industry, producing the most carbon-intensive of products,
faces almost inevitable decline in the long term, relative to the
baseline projection. Technologies still under development,
such as CO, removal and storage from coal-burning plants and
in-situ gasification, could play a future role in maintaining the
output of coal whilst avoiding CO, and other emissions.
Particularly large effects on the coal sector are expected from
policies such as the removal of fossil fuel subsidies or the
restructuring of energy taxes so as to tax the carbon content
rather than the energy content of fuels. It is a well-established
finding that removal of the subsidies would result in substan-
tial reductions in GHG emissions, as well as stimulating eco-
nomic growth. However, the effects in specific countries
depend heavily on the type of subsidy removed and the com-
mercial viability of alternative energy sources, including
imported coal.
"	Text
"It is also well established that the overall effects on GDP of
mitigation policies and measures, whether positive or negative,
conceal large differences between sectors. In general, the ener-
gy intensity and the carbon intensity of the economies will
decline. The coal and perhaps the oil industries are expected to
lose substantial proportions of their traditional output relative
to those in the reference scenarios, though the impact of this on
the industries will depend on diversification, and other sectors
may increase their outputs but by much smaller proportions.
Reductions in fossil fuel output below the baseline will not
impact all fossil fuels equally. Fuels have different costs and
Price sensitivities; they respond differently to mitigation poli-
cies. Energy-efficiency technology is fuel and combustion
device-specific, and reductions in demand can affect imports
differently from output. Energy-intensive sectors, such as
heavy chemicals, iron and steel, and mineral products, will face
higher costs, accelerated technical or organizational change, or
loss of output (again relative to the reference scenario) depend-
ing on their energy use and the policies adopted for mitigation.

"Industries concerned directly with mitigation are likely to ben-
efit from action. These industries include renewable and
nuclear electricity, producers of mitigation equipment (incorpo-

long term from the availability of financial and other resources
that would otherwise have been taken up in fossil fuel produc-
tion. They may also benefit from reductions in tax burdens if
taxes are used for mitigation and the revenues recycled as
reductions in employer, corporate, or other taxes. Those studies
that report reductions in GDP do not always provide a range of
recycling options, suggesting that policy packages increasing
GDP have not been explored. The extent and nature of the ben-
efits will vary with the policies followed. Some mitigation poli-

tries can only meet their Kyoto Protocol commitments by
reducing overall energy use and this will result in a reduction

natural gas for power generation. The modelling of such a

for increased use of zero-emitting technologies (such as

gas). Or, second, they drive their increased use indirectly by
more flexible approaches that place a tax on or require a per-
mit for emission of GHGs. Either way, the result will be a shift
in the mix of fuels used to generate electricity towards
increased use of the zero- and lower-emitting generation tech-

"The direct costs for fossil fuel consumption are accompanied
by environmental and public health benefits associated with a
reduction in the extraction and burning of the fuels. These
benefits come from a reduction in the damages caused by
these activities, especially a reduction in the emissions of pol-
lutants that are associated with combustion, such as SO,,
NO,, CO and other chemicals, and particulate matter. This
will improve local and regional air and water quality, and
thereby lessen damage to human, animal, and plant health,
and to ecosystems. If all the pollutants associated with GHG
emissions are removed by new technologies or end-of-pipe
abatement (for example, flue gas desulphurization on a power
station combined with removal of all other non-GHG pollu-
tants), then this ancillary benefit will no longer exist. But such
abatement is limited at present and it is expensive, especially
for small-scale emissions from dwellings and cars (See also
Section 8.6).

"Mitigation policies are less effective if they lead to loss of
international competitiveness or the migration of GHG-emit-

literature, on international price competitiveness are small
while those on carbon leakage appear to beat the stage of com-
peting explanations, with large differences depending on the
models and the assumptions used. There are several reasons for
expecting that such effects will not be substantial. First, miti-
gation policies actually adopted use a range of instruments and
usually include special treatment to minimize adverse industri-
al effects, such as exemptions for energy-intensive industries.
Second, the models assume that any migrating industries will
use the average technology of the area to which they will
move; however, instead they may adopt newer, lower CO,-
emitting technologies. Third, the mitigation policies also
encourage low-emission technologies and these also may
migrate, reducing emissions in industries in other countries

"Climate change is profoundly different from most other envi-
ronmental problems with which humanity has grappled. A
combination of several features lends the climate problem its
uniqueness. They include public good issues raising from the
concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere that requires collec-
tive global action, the multiplicity of decision makers ranging
from global down to the micro level of firms and individuals,
and the heterogeneity of emissions and their consequences
around the world. Moreover, the long-term nature of climate
change originates from the fact that it is the concentration of
GHGs that matters rather than their annual emissions and this
feature raises the thorny issues of intergenerational transfers of
wealth and environmental goods and bads. Next, human activ-
ities associated with climate change are widespread, which
makes narrowly defined technological solutions impossible,
and the interactions of climate policy with other broad socio-
economic policies are strong. Finally, large uncertainties or in
some areas even ignorance characterize many aspects of the
problem and require a risk management approach to be adopt-
ed in all DMFs that deal with climate change.

on climate change will have a significant influence on the
effectiveness and costs and benefits of mitigation. The effec-
tiveness and the costs and benefits of an international climate
change regime (such as the Kyoto Protocol or other possible
future agreements) depend on the number of signatories to the
agreement and their abatement targets and/or policy commit-
ment. At the same time, the number of signatories depends on
the question of how equitably the commitments of participants
are shared. Economic efficiency (minimizing costs by maxi-
mizing participation) and equity (the allocation of emissions
limitation commitments) are therefore strongly linked.

"Cost-effectiveness analyses seek the lowest cost of achieving
an environmental target by equalizing the marginal costs of
mitigation across space and time. Long-term cost-effectiveness
studies estimate the costs of stabilizing atmospheric CO, con-
centrations at different levels and find that the costs of the
450ppmv ceiling are substantially greater than those of the
750ppmv limit. Rather than seeking a single optimal path, the
tolerable windows/safe landing approach seeks to delineate the
complete array of possible emission paths that satisfy external-
ly defined climate impact and emission cost constraints.
Results indicate that delaying near-term effective emission
reductions can drastically reduce the future range of options for
relatively tight climate change targets, while less tight targets
offer more near-term flexibility.

"There is a three-way relationship between the design of the
international regime, the cost-effectiveness/efficiency of cli-
mate policies, and the equity of the consequent economic out-
comes. As a consequence, it is crucial to design the interna-
tional regime in a way that is considered both efficient and
equitable. The literature presents different theoretical strategies
to optimize an international regime. For example, it can be
made attractive for countries to join the group that commits to
specific targets for limitation and reduction of emissions by
increasing the equity of a larger agreement — and therefore its
efficiency — through measures like an appropriate distribution
of targets over time, the linkage of the climate debate with
other issues (“issue linkage”), the use of financial transfers to
affected countries (“side payments‘), or technology transfer

hedging even for low-probability, high-consequence scenarios
(see Figure TS.10b). However, decisions about near-term cli-
mate policies may have to be made while the stabilization tar-
get is still being debated. Decision-making therefore should
consider appropriate hedging against future resolution of that
target and possible revision of the scientific insights in the risks
of climate change. There are significant differences in the two
approaches. With a cost-effectiveness analysis, the target must
be made regardless of costs. With a cost-benefit analysis, costs
and benefits are balanced at the margin. Nevertheless, the basic
message is quite similar and involves the explicit incorporation
of uncertainty and its sequential resolution over time. The
desirable amount of hedging depends upon one’s assessment of
the stakes, the odds, and the costs of policy measures. The risk
premium — the amount that society is willing to pay to reduce
risk — ultimately is a political decision that differs among coun-
tries.

transfer requires more than technology itself. An enabling

hand, sustainable development discourse needs greater analyti-

concept advance from theory to practice. On the other hand, cli-
mate change discourse needs to be aware of both the restrictive
set of assumptions underlying the tools and methods applied in
the analysis, and the social and political implications of scientif-
ic constructions of climate change. Over recent years a good
deal of analytical work has addressed the problem in both direc-
tions. Various approaches have been explored to transcend the
limits of the standard views and decision frameworks in dealing
with issues of uncertainty, complexity, and the contextual influ-

frameworks for articulating new institutional arrangements.

"It is difficult to generalize about sustainable development poli-
cies and choices. Sustainability implies and requires diversity,
flexibility, and innovation. Policy choices are meant to intro-
duce changes in technological patterns of natural resource use,
production and consumption, structural changes in the produc-
tion systems, spatial distribution of population and economic
activities, and behavioural patterns. Climate change literature
has by and large addressed the first three topics, while the rel-
evance of choices and decisions related to behavioural patterns
and lifestyles has been paid scant attention. Consumption pat-
terns in the industrialized countries are an important reason for
climate change. If people changed their preferences this could
alleviate climate change considerably. To change consumption
patterns, however, people must not only change their behaviour
but also change themselves because these patterns are an
essential element of lifestyles and, therefore, of self-esteem.
Yet, apart from climate change there are other reasons to do so
as well as indications that this change can be fostered politi-

based on their own exposure and their sensitivity to other coun-

from consolidating national targets, possibly involving side

national costs. Compared to the expected net damages associ-
ated with the global target, nation states might reconsider their
own national targets, especially as new information becomes
available on global and regional patterns and impacts of cli-

of negotiations. It follows from the above that establishing the

"There is no presumption that any particular perspective for
analysis is most appropriate at any level. Moreover, the three
perspectives are viewed here as being highly synergistic. The
important changes have been primarily in the types of ques-
tions being asked and the kinds of information being sought.
In practice, the literature has expanded to add new issues and
new tools, subsuming rather than discarding the analyses
included in the other ones. The range and scope of climate pol-
icy analyses can be understood as a gradual broadening of the
types and extent of uncertainties that analysts have been will-
ing and able to address.

"Previous IPCC assessment reports sought to facilitate this pur-
suit by comprehensively describing, cataloguing and compar-
ing technologies and policy instruments that could be used to
achieve mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-
effective and efficient manner. The present assessment
advances this process by including recent analyses of climate
change that place policy evaluations in the context of sustain-
able development. This expansion of scope is consistent both
with the evolution of the literature on climate change and
importance accorded by the UNFCCC to sustainable develop-
ment - including the recognition that “Parties have a right to,
and should promote sustainable development” (Art. 3.4). It
therefore goes some way towards filling the gaps in earlier
assessments.

"This chapter places climate change mitigation, mitigation pol-
icy, and the contents of the rest of the report in the broader con-
text of development, equity, and sustainability. This context
reflects the explicit conditions and principles laid down by the
UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on
the pursuit of the ultimate objective of stabilizing greenhouse
gas concentrations. The UNFCCC imposes three conditions on
the goal of stabilization, namely, that it should take place with-
in a time-frame sufficient to “allow ecosystems to adapt natu-
rally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not
threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in
a sustainable manner” (Art. 2). It also specifies several princi-
ples to guide this process: equity, common but differentiated
responsibilities, precaution, cost-effective measures, right to
sustainable development, and support for an open internation-
al economic system (Art. 3).

"Climate Change involves complex interactions between climat-
ic, environmental, economic, political, institutional, social, and
technological processes. It cannot be addressed or comprehend-
ed in isolation from broader societal goals (such as sustainable
development), or other existing or probable future sources of
stress. In keeping with this complexity, a multiplicity of
approaches have emerged to analyze climate change and relat-
ed challenges. Many of these incorporate concerns about devel-
opment, equity, and sustainability (albeit partially and gradual-
ly) into their framework and recommendations. Each approach
emphasizes certain elements of the problem, and focuses on
certain classes of responses, including for example, optimal
policy design, building capacity for designing and implement-
ing policies, strengthening synergies between climate change
mitigation and/or adaptation and other societal goals, and poli-
cies to enhance societal learning. These approaches are there-
fore complementary rather than mutually exclusive.
"	Text
"This chapter brings together three broad classes of analysis,
which differ not so much in terms of their ultimate goals as in
their points of departure and preferred analytical tools. The
three approaches start with concerns, respectively, about effi-
ciency and cost-effectiveness, equity and sustainable develop-
ment, and global sustainability and societal learning. The dif-
ference between the three approaches we have selected lies in
their starting point, not in their ultimate goals. Regardless of
the starting point of the analysis, many studies try in their own
way to incorporate other concerns. For example, many analy-
ses that approach climate change mitigation from a cost-effec-
tiveness perspective try to bring in considerations of equity and
sustainability through their treatment of costs, benefits, and
welfare. Similarly, the class of studies motivated strongly by
considerations of inter-country equity tend to argue that equity
is needed to ensure that developing countries can pursue their
internal goals of sustainable development—a concept that
includes the implicit components of sustainability and efficien-
cy. Likewise, analysts focused on concerns of global sustain-
ability have been compelled by their own logic to make a case
for global efficiency—often modelled as the decoupling of pro-
duction from material flows—and social equity. In other words,
each of the three perspectives has led writers to search for ways
to incorporate concerns that lie beyond their initial starting
point. All three classes of analyses look at the relationship of
climate change mitigation with all three goals—development,
equity, and sustainability—albeit in different and often highly
complementary ways. Nevertheless, they frame the issues dif-
ferently, focus on different sets of causal relationships, use dif-
ferent tools of analysis, and often come to somewhat different
conclusions.

"While sustainability has been incorporated in the analyses in a
number of ways, a class of studies takes the issue of Global
Sustainability as the point of departure. One popular method
for identifying constraints and opportunities within this per-
spective is to identify future sustainable states and then exam-
ine possible transition paths to those states for feasibility and
desirability. In the case of developing countries this leads to a
number of possible strategies that can depart significantly from
what the developed countries pursued in the past.
"	Text
"The chapter closes with a discussion of preliminary attempts to
integrate the information and insights that result from studies
done from the three perspectives. Within this report the con-
cept of “co-benefits” is used to capture dimensions of the
response to mitigation policies from the equity and sustainabil-
ity perspectives in a way that could be used to modify the cost
projections produced by those working form the cost-effec-
tiveness perspective although ancillary benefit has been more
widely used in the literature. The concept of “mitigative capac-
ity” is also introduced as a possible way to integrate results
derived from the application of the three perspectives in the

to include considerations not simply of the impacts of climate

to achieve emissions reductions were almost exclusively based
on estimates of their fossil fuel consumption. With a few

mitigation is, indeed, entirely consistent with the overall evo-

"In fact, the analysis of climate change policies has evolved sig-
nificantly between the preparation of the First Assessment
Report (FAR; IPCC, 1991), the Second Assessment Report
(SAR; IPCC, 1996), and Third Assessment Report (TAR) of
the IPCC. In the late 1980s, for example, the focus of policy
analysis was almost exclusively on climate change mitigation
through emissions reduction. GHG emissions were modelled
almost exclusively in terms of carbon dioxide (CO,) from ener-
gy use (Nordhaus and Yohe, 1983; Edmonds and Reilly, 1985);
and emissions reductions were to be achieved primarily by
increasing the prices of fossil fuels. Hence, it is hardly surpris-
ing that, with a few exceptions (e.g., Bradley and Williams,
1989; Parikh et al., 1991), carbon taxes were overwhelmingly
the most commonly analyzed policy instrument. FAR (IPCC,
1991) documents the possible ramifications of a wide range of
policy instruments, but it reports that carbon taxes are again the
most fully analyzed in the literature. This report, by way of
contrast, demonstrates a significant enhancement in the capac-
ity of policy analysts to consider the sources and sinks of mul-
tiple gases as well as a broader array of policy instruments to
curtailing the emission of these gases into the atmosphere.

"This chapter puts climate change mitigation and climate
change mitigation policy in the broader context of develop-
ment, equity, and sustainability. The ultimate objective of the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC) “‘is to achieve ... stabilization of greenhouse gas
(GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would
prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate
system. Such a level should be achieved within a timeframe
sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate
change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to
enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable man-
ner” (Article 2). The UNFCCC goes on to specify principles that
should guide this process: equity, common but differentiated
responsibilities, precaution, cost-effectiveness, the right to sus-
tainable development, and the avoidance of arbitrary restriction
on international trade (Article 3). Previous Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment reports sought to
lay the groundwork for policymakers pursuing the UNFCCC
goals by comprehensively describing, cataloguing, and compar-
ing technologies and policy instruments that could be used to
achieve the mitigation of GHG emissions.
"	Text
"Consistent with the state of the policy literature on climate
change, FAR (IPCC, 1991) also made no attempt to address
issues of equity. Prior to the publication of Global Warming in
an Unequal World (Agarwal and Narain, 199 1a), consideration
of the fairness of climate change policies (both among and
within countries) received little attention from analysts and
policymakers (for exceptions see Grubb, 1989; Kasperson and
Dow, 1991; Parikh er al., 1991). The IPCC Second Assessment
Report WGIII (IPCC WG III, 1996) did, however, mention the
need to extend the focus of analysis and assessment into areas
that included issues not only of equity and fairness, but also of
development and sustainability. Some of the studies available
then did note the distributional effects of alternative policy
designs and targets; and some did trace other effects into the
domains of development and sustainability. The point here is
not that earlier work ignored these broader issues, but that this
report begins the process of making them more central in the
assessment of the existing policy analyses. This report begins
the task of integrating technology and policy characterizations
into alternative development scenarios and policy decision-
frameworks that are broadly conceived. In the same spirit, this
chapter seeks to locate the work of WGIII in a broader context
of development, equity, and sustainability. In the process, we
draw on several themes (elaborated in subsequent chapters) to
identify opportunities to enhance the capacity of regions, coun-
tries, and communities to mitigate GHG emissions while
simultaneously pursuing their sustainable development goals.
Neither the greenhouse gas mitigation nor the sustainable
development initiative, however, eliminates the need to con-
duct efficiency-based assessments of the opportunity costs of
mitigation and/or the enhancement of the capacity to mitigate.
Instead, climate change and sustainable development both sim-
ply expand the number of objectives against which these costs
need to be measured.

assessments is labelled “Cost-effectiveness” in Figure 1.1. It
represents the field of conventional climate policy analysis that
is well represented in the First through to the Third
Assessments. These analyses are generally driven directly or
indirectly by the question of what is the most cost-effective
amount of mitigation for the global economy starting from a
particular baseline GHG emissions scenario, and reflecting a
specific set of socioeconomic scenarios. Within this frame-
work, important issues include measuring the performance of
various technologies and the removal of barriers (such as exist-

"Throughout this evolution, though, the historical model of
societies that industrialized in the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries served as the central notion of what constitutes devel-
opment in both the cost-effectiveness and equity perspectives.
According to some analysts (e.g., Simon and Kahn, 1984;
Beckerman, 1996) this path represents the best model for glob-
al prosperity. However, a growing parallel literature recognizes
the importance of diverse development pathways in achieving
an environmentally and socioeconomically sustainable world
(see Section 1.4). This insight can serve as the basis of a third
analytical perspective—a perspective represented in Figure 1.1
by “Global Sustainability”. As yet, however, analyses of such
alternative development pathways remain largely unrealized
within the framework of IPCC. Still, the first steps in this
direction can be detected throughout this volume.

"The expansion of the range and scope of IPCC policy analysis,
just described, can be understood as a gradual broadening of
the types and extent of uncertainties that analysts have been
willing and able to address. A graphic representation of this
expansion of interest and capability (Figure /.1) shows that the
policy sciences have made significant advances since IPCC
FAR. This figure simply depicts different perspectives that
have been employed to examine climate policy issues and the
stage at which they were incorporated into the IPCC process.
Progression through the IPCC assessments displayed in Figure
1.1 represents expansions in the scope of climate policy analy-
ses since 1980. There is no presumption that any particular
framework for analysis is most appropriate at any level. The
important changes are primarily in the types of questions being
asked and the kinds of information being sought. In practice,
the literature has expanded to add new issues and has sub-
sumed rather than discarded the analyses of the initial issues.
With each assessment, IPCC has added to the necessary tool
set without obviating the need for the tools developed in the
earlier assessments.

"By introducing the issue of equity, SAR (IPCC, 1996) broad-
ened the IPCC policy discourse; a process reflected by
“Equity” in Figure 1.1. The impetus for this expansion in the
scope of the discourse was to include considerations not sim-
ply of the impacts of climate change and mitigation policies on
global welfare as a whole, but also of the effects of climate
change and mitigation policies on existing inequalities among
and within nations. The literature on equity and climate change
has advanced considerably since SAR, but there is no consen-
sus on what constitutes fairness. Once equity issues were intro-
duced into the IPCC assessment agenda, though, they became
important components in defining the search for efficient emis-
sions mitigation pathways. The considerable literature that
indicates how environmental policies could be hampered or
even blocked by those who considered them unfair became rel-
evant (National Academy of Engineering, 1986; Rayner and
Cantor, 1987; Grubb, 1989; Weiss, 1989; Kasperson and Dow,
1991). In light of these results, it became clear how and why
any widespread perception that a mitigation strategy is unfair
would likely engender opposition to that strategy, perhaps to
the extent of rendering it non-optimal (or even infeasible).
Some cost-effectiveness analyses had, in fact, laid the ground-
work for applying this literature by demonstrating the sensitiv-

between alternative approaches and analytical frameworks. All
three classes of analyses look at the relationship of climate
change mitigation with all three goals—development, equity,
and sustainability—albeit in different and often highly comple-
mentary ways. Nevertheless, they frame the issues differently,
focus on different sets of causal relationships, use different
tools of analysis, and often come to somewhat different con-
clusions. Accordingly, they are likely to be useful to decision
makers in different ways.

"The expansion of analytic perspectives also represents the
increasing complexity of issues selected for analytic focus. On
the left-hand side of Figure 1.1, complexity refers primarily to
the analytical challenges presented by individual technologies
(such as fuel cells or photovoltaics) or specific policy instru-
ments (such as carbon taxes or tradable emissions permits).
Moving from left to right across the figure, such complexities
become compounded, first by interactions among technologies
and policy instruments, then among mitigation and adaptation
issues, and, finally among climate change issues narrowly
defined and a wide range of environmental and socioeconom-
ic issues. Finally, linkages and interactions with policy objec-

picture.

although models centred on Organization of Economic Co-

ful first-order insights into the efficacy of global policy inter-
ventions, the underlying assumptions may make such models
less useful when the heterogeneity of nations is incorporated
fully. Recognition of this heterogeneity may lead to a different
range of policy options than considered likely thus far, and
may ultimately feed back into policy design for Annex I coun-
tries. Recognizing heterogeneity among countries reveals, in
short, differences in the capacities of different sectors, which
may also enhance appreciation of what can be done by non-

"The above description of three complementary perspectives on
climate change mitigation and the broad societal goals of
development, equity, and sustainability bears elaboration. The
rest of this chapter can be seen as a triptych, in which each sec-
tion presents a particular perspective on climate change miti-
gation—motivated respectively by considerations of cost-effec-
tiveness, equity, and sustainability. However, we also describe
how each of the perspectives has attempted to address and
incorporate concerns that lie beyond their initial starting
points. For example, Section 1.2 details the Cost-effectiveness
perspective; however, its two concluding sections, (1.2.5 and
1.2.6) describe how this approach has addressed concerns of
equity and sustainability. Similarly, Section 1.3 is entitled
“Equity and Sustainable Development” in recognition of the
fact that writers examining the issue of climate change from a
vantage point of global equity have generally sought to explore
how developing countries could pursue their sustainable devel-
opment goals. In the penultimate sub-section (1.3.4) of this
section, we examine the concept of sustainable development
and describe its relationship to cost-effectiveness, efficiency,
and sustainability. Finally, the theme of Section 1.4 is Global
sustainability; and its two main sub-sections (1.4.2 and 1.4.3)
discuss issues of resource efficiency (de-coupling growth from
resource flows), and values and norms that include issues of
equity.

"A major part of the complexity that must be dealt with in for-
mulating climate policies is the uncertainties about how the
world and the climate system will evolve without new policies,
about what policies will be implemented now and in the future,
and about the efficacy of those policies. The economist Frank
Knight (1921) introduced a fundamental distinction between
“tisk” and “uncertainty”,? whereby risk refers to cases for
which the probable outcomes are predicted through well-estab-
lished theories and methods, and with reliable data (e.g., the
radiative forcing of a tonne of CO, or the efficiency of a gas
turbine); and uncertainty to situations in which theories and
methods are widely accepted, but the appropriate data are not
available or are fragmentary, and probabilities and outcomes
can be assessed subjectively by relevant experts. In this situa-
tion, formal decision-analytic tools can be quite useful, but
only if carefully and systematically applied (Savage, 1954;
Raiffa, 1968; Howard, 1980, 1988: Howard and Matheson,
1984). There is, however, a third state in the climate context,
which may be called decision making under deep uncertainty
(sometimes also referred to as “secondary” uncertainties; see
Fischbeck, 1991). For deep uncertainty, it is not possible to
specify the behaviour of major components of a system
because of the absence of or contradictions in data, methods,
and/or theory. Decision-analytic methods can still be applied,
but the process of eliciting subjective probabilities is much
more complicated. The experts must factor in assessments
about the likelihood of each of the alternative theories being
correct, on top of assessments of the probabilities for alterna-
tive parameter values within the methods suggested by that
theory. In addition, the experts need to provide some estimate
of the uncertainty in outcomes caused by factors not incorpo-
rated into any existing theory. For example, there may be dis-
continuities in the response of the climate or ecological sys-
tems that occur at as yet unrecognized thresholds.

"Since they have different starting points and objectives, the
three approaches to climate policy analysis have exhibited
somewhat different approaches to handling uncertainty.
Applications of the cost-effectiveness approach have generally
ignored uncertainty completely or stayed fairly close to the tra-

a limited number of subjectively accessed probabilities on key
uncertainties. Applications of the equity approach have been
focused on the risks climate change and climate change poli-
cies might pose to the “most vulnerable” elements of the glob-
al population and have generally employed sensitivity analyses
to accomplish this objective. Studies done from the sustain-
ability perspective have more often than not focused on the
robustness of policies (and especially those designed to build
climate mitigation and adaptation possibilities) across wide
ranges of values for uncertain inputs and parameters.

"The rest of this chapter elaborates each of the three analytic per-
spectives shown in Figure 1.1. The motivation for this elabora-
tion is threefold. First, it is to help the reader situate each per-
spective in the evolution of policy science as reflected in IPCC
assessments. Second, it is designed to situate the issue of GHG
emissions mitigation in the context of climate policy more broad-
ly. Third, it seeks to locate climate policy in a broader context of
concerns about development, equity, and sustainability. However,
it must be emphasized that Figure 1.] does not represent any sort
of linear evolution in which one kind of analytic tool or policy
focus replaces a predecessor. Rather than a hierarchy of
approaches, the evolution of perspectives suggests a portfolio
approach both to assessment and policy choice. Just like a per-
sonal investment portfolio, a rational global climate policy port-
folio contains a flexible mix of diverse commitments consistent
with different development goals, and to protect against different
contingencies at various levels of uncertainty about the future.

"Researchers working from a cost-effective perspective gener-
ally focus on achieving some policy objective at minimum
cost. Cost minimization, in some cases, is used to compare
alternative ways to meet some climate policy objective (like a
specific GHG emissions or concentration target); in other
cases, alternative ways to minimize the total cost of climate
change and policies designed to ameliorate its impacts are con-
sidered. In the former, the policy objective is included as a con-
straint; but in the latter, the objective is to minimize the cost of
the climate change. In either case, the policies considered are
generally restricted to those that directly affect energy use or
other activities with a direct impact on GHG emissions.
Although equity and sustainability metrics are frequently
examined in these analyses, their inclusion usually occurs after
the cost-effectiveness calculations have been completed.
Exceptions to this general observation include input assump-
tions related to discounting and utility function parameters that
do represent trade-offs between the utilities of various groups
and generations. Judicious use of sensitivity analysis can, how-
ever, illuminate the trade-offs implied along these dimensions,
but these trade-offs are not usually the main focus of such stud-
ies. It is therefore difficult, ex post, to graft other policy objec-

to effect this avoidance were recognized widely. At present,
however, there are concerns about the sacrifices that avoiding

igation policy analysis is thus to discern how climate change
can be avoided at a minimal cost or sacrifice. Chapters 3-9
describe a number of advances since WGIII SAR that identify
methods to reduce the costs of climate change mitigation.
Indeed, these chapters report that some degree of mitigation
might be achieved at zero cost.

"Chapter 7 distinguishes several cost concepts. Opportunity cost
(the value of a sacrificed opportunity) constitutes a basis upon
which estimates of economic cost are constructed. The extent
of the costs of mitigating climate change is, from an economic
perspective, measured in terms of the value of other opportu-
nities that must be forgone (for example, the opportunity to
enjoy low prices for domestic heating or other energy ser-
vices). It follows that economic costs can be different when
they are viewed from different perspectives. Costs of mitiga-
tion incurred by a regulated sector are, for example, generally
different from economy-wide costs. Costs are sometimes mea-
sured in currency units, but they are sometimes also measured

"Chapter 8 reports that the cost of mitigation can depend signif-
icantly on the selection of a designated concentration target
that, typically, is assumed to be achievable within 100 or 200
years. Most model-based studies indicate that the first units of
abatement are fairly inexpensive; “low-hanging fruit” is easily
picked. However, most studies show that additional units of
abatement require more extensive changes and involve signif-
icantly higher costs.* Thus, to lower the original concentration
target is projected to result in a more than proportional increase
in costs. Rising marginal abatement costs provide a rationale to
employ broad-based, economically efficient mechanisms for
GHG abatement.
"	Text
"Chapter 7 also indicates that some notions of cost incorporate
behavioural, institutional, or cultural responses that can be
missed by economic analyses. In measuring opportunity costs,
more specifically, economic analyses generally take personal
preferences, social and legal institutions, and cultural values as
given. Yet climate policies can affect (positively or negatively)
the functioning of institutions. They can alter the ways in
which people relate to each other; and they can influence indi-
viduals’ attitudes, values, or preferences. Taking these impacts
into account can alter the cost assessment. Moreover, while
economic analyses (including standard benefit-cost analyses)
tend to measure costs by adding up individuals’ valuations of
their forgone opportunities, other approaches to cost can be
defined in terms that are not simple aggregations of individual
measures.

"The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change makes clear that cost-effectiveness is an important cri-
terion to be used (among others) in formulating and imple-
menting climate policies. As stated in Article 3.3 of the con-
vention “...taking into account that policies and measures to
deal with climate change should be cost-effective so as to
ensure that global benefits at the lowest possible cost (UNFCC,
1992)”. The impacts of climate policy can be defined as the
changes that policies cause relative to some “business-as-
usual” or “baseline” situation. As discussed in Chapter 2, a
baseline is a scenario of how the global or regional environ-
ments, depending on the study, will evolve over time (often
over 100 years or more for baselines used in climate policy
studies) in the absence of climate policy intervention. Thus, a
baseline is typically built upon assumptions about future pop-
ulation growth, economic output, and resource and technology
availability, as well as upon assumptions about future non-cli-
mate environmental policies, like controls on sulphur dioxide
emissions. Changes from these baselines are frequently put
into categories of “benefits” and “costs”. The benefits includ-
ed in the calculus are estimated from avoided climate damages
and other ancillary benefits that would have otherwise
occurred if mitigation policies had not been introduced. The
costs for mitigation and other side effects that result are esti-
mated from economic sacrifices that might be required to mit-
igate climate change.

"It is worth emphasizing that abatement policies (such as the
introduction of national targets on carbon emissions or policies
to stimulate the development of energy technologies not based
on carbon, as discussed in Chapter 3) can proceed in the near
term even when abatement efforts are significantly deferred to
the future. The near-term introduction of policies helps to stim-
ulate efforts to bring about new technologies, which is crucial
to enable future abatement to be achieved at lower cost.
"	Text
"It is also important to keep in mind that aggregate costs are not
the only useful consideration in evaluating alternative policy
instruments from the cost-effectiveness perspective. The distri-
bution of these costs across businesses, regions, and individu-
als is important as well. Moreover, other important evaluation
criteria, including administrative and political feasibility, can
play a role in determining exactly how and why mitigation ini-
tiatives might emerge.

"The issue of revenue recycling applies also to policies that
would reduce CO, through carbon permits or “caps”. As dis-
cussed in Chapter 6, revenues could be recycled through cuts
in existing taxes if CO, permits are auctioned. In contrast, if
the permits are distributed freely, then no revenue is collected
and there is no possibility of revenue recycling. Thus, auction-
ing the permits has a significant potential cost advantage over
free allocation.

"As Chapter 6 discusses, individual countries can choose from a
large set of possible policy instruments to limit domestic GHG
emissions. These include traditional regulatory mechanisms
such as technology mandates and performance standards. They
also include “market-based” instruments such as carbon taxes,
energy taxes, tradable emissions permits, and subsidies to clean
technologies. They also include various voluntary agreements
between industries and regulators. A group of countries that
wishes to limit its collective GHG emissions can agree to
implement some of these policies in a co-ordinated fashion.

"While market-based instruments such as carbon taxes and trad-
able carbon permits have potential cost advantages, the extent
to which these potential advantages are actually realized
depends on whether the policy generates revenues and whether
these revenues are “recycled” in the form of cuts in existing
taxes. Revenue recycling is important to the costs of a carbon
tax, for example. When the revenues from the carbon tax
finance reductions in the rates of pre-existing taxes, some of
the distortionary cost of these prior taxes can be avoided; and
so the cost of mitigation is reduced. These issues are further
elaborated in Chapters 6-9.

"Chapters 6-9 reveal that the costs of achieving specified miti-
gation targets depend critically upon the policy instrument
employed. Any given target is achieved at the lowest cost when
the incremental cost of emissions reduction (abatement) is the
same across all emitters. If this condition is not met, then the
overall costs of emissions reduction could be reduced if firms
with lower incremental costs reduced emissions a bit more, and
firms with higher incremental costs pursued a bit less abate-
ment. It follows that cost-effective emissions reductions hold
the promise of allowing larger emissions reductions from any
allocation of resources

"Most studies of national or global mitigation costs focus on
CO, from fossil energy alone (e.g., see Chapter 8), but some
recent studies consider other GHGs as well. For example,
Chapters 3 and 4 discuss options to reduce emissions of non-
CO, gases and CO, net emissions from land-use change,
respectively. Chapter 8 indicates that defining national targets
in terms of a “basket” of gases (as under the Kyoto Protocol)
rather than in terms of individual gases enhances flexibility and
can reduce the costs of mitigating climate change. Emissions of
several of the GHGs (such as methane and nitrous oxide) from
some sources can, in addition, be very difficult to monitor. This
practical complication raises the potential cost of mitigation
"	Text
"the future allows more discounting of abatement costs.
However, other studies show potential cost advantages in
concentrating more abatement towards the near term. These
studies argue, in particular, that near-term abatement helps
generate cost-effective “learning-by-doing”, by accelerating
the development of new technologies that can reduce future
abatement costs. These findings are not necessarily contradic-
tory. By introducing mitigation efforts in the near term, the
process of learning-by-doing is initiated. At the same time, by
increasing over time the stringency of policies (that is, the
extent of abatement), nations can avoid premature capital-
stock turnover and exploit the cost savings from future techno-
logical advances. Chapter 10 elaborates on these issues.
"	Text
"The theoretical and modelling literature also reveals that interna-
tional policy co-ordination through “flexibility mechanisms”
offers enormous opportunities to achieve given reductions in
GHG emissions at relatively lower cost. In principle, co-ordinat-
ed policies can be designed so that cost-effectiveness is
improved on a global scale. The Kyoto Protocol defines several
flexibility mechanisms, including international emissions trading
(IET), joint implementation (JI), and the clean development
mechanism (CDM). Each of these international policy instru-
ments provides opportunities, in theory, for Annex I Parties to
fulfil their commitments cost-effectively. IET allows Annex I
parties to exchange parts of their assigned amount. Similarly, JI
allows Annex I parties to exchange “emission reduction units”
among themselves on a project-by-project basis. Under the
CDM, Annex I parties receive credit, on a project-by-project
basis, for reductions accomplished in non-Annex I countries.
Participation in these programmes can also increase the level of
investment in clean energy technologies. International policy co-
ordination in implementing climate policy also requires account-
ing for the “ spillover” effects of mitigation in one country that
can effect economic activity in other countries through interna-
tional trade linkages. In general, countries that mitigate less may
gain an advantage in their share of international trade over their
trading partners, but can also lose market share if those trading
partners control more and thus reduce their overall level of eco-
nomic activity. See Chapter 8 for more on these issues.

point of view argue that there is some chance that scientific
inquiry will eventually reveal that the continued accumulation
of GHGs will not produce significant changes in climate and/or
significant associated damages. So long as the possibility

will occur. There is a significant possibility that scientific
investigations will ultimately reveal that the continued accu-
mulation of GHGs will have severe consequences for climate
and substantial associated impacts. If this scenario should
materialize, the cost of making this “type two” error (of taking
little or no action in the near term to stem the accumulation of
GHGs) could be enormous. As discussed in Chapters 8-10, it
may be less costly to spread the costs of averting climate
change by beginning mitigation efforts early, rather than to
wait several decades and take actions after the problem has
already advanced much further. Indeed, if postponing mitiga-
tion efforts allows irreversible climate impacts to occur, then
no future efforts, at any cost, can undo the resultant damage.

"The time horizon for climate change is long. The climate
impacts of decisions made in the next decade or two will be felt
over the next century and beyond. As a result, technology and,
more specifically, improvements in the rate and direction of
technological change, will play a very important role. As dis-
cussed in Chapter 2, the development and diffusion of new
technologies is perhaps the most robust and effective way to
reduce GHG emissions. Three aspects of technology can be
distinguished: invention (the development, perhaps in a labo-
ratory, of a new production method, product, or service), inno-
vation (the bringing of new inventions to the market), and dif-
fusion (the gradual adoption of new processes or products by
firms and individuals). Chapter 3 indicates that hundreds of
recently invented technologies can improve energy efficiency
and thus reduce energy and associated GHG emissions. These
technologies can yield more energy-efficient buildings and
appliances and equipment used in them. There are, however,
significant barriers to their innovation and diffusion. Chapter 5
(see also IPCC, 2000a) classifies these barriers and provides a
framework for understanding their connections with one anoth-
er. Some new low-carbon emission technologies are not adopt-
ed because their cost and performance characteristics make
them unattractive relative to existing technologies. To be
adopted, these technologies require tax advantages, cost subsi-
dies, or additional cost-reducing or performance-enhancing
research and development (R&D; see Chapter 6 for a discus-
sion of the possible efficacy of such policies). Other technolo-
gies could be adopted more rapidly if market failures and other
socioeconomic constraints are reduced. Market failures refers
to situations in which the price system does not allocate
resources efficiently (see, e.g., Opschoor, 1997). They can
emerge when information is not fully disseminated or when
market prices do not reflect the full social cost. So, a new tech-
nology may not be employed if potential purchasers lack
information about it or if its price lies between its private value
and its, potentially higher, social value.

impacts across household income groups. According to most
studies, mitigation policies that imply higher energy prices
impose higher cost-burdens (relative to income) on less affluent

"Uncertainty also bears on the design of mitigation policies. As
indicated in Chapters 8 and 10, the problem of climate change
might be addressed most effectively through a process of
sequential decision making, in which policies are adjusted over
time as new scientific information becomes available and
uncertainties are reduced. Moss and Schneider (2000) offer
guidance on how subjective probabilities can be utilized effec-
tively when empirical data are not available or are inconclu-
sive. New information is valuable, and flexible policies that
can make use of this information have an advantage over rigid
ones that cannot. In any case, policies that help build or
strengthen mitigation capacity are consistent with the insur-
ance approach. To the extent that mitigation capacity is higher,
the costs of future action can be expected to be lower.

"For the most part, existing studies of the impacts across house-

developed nations. There is a severe need for studies that con-
sider the distributional impacts within developing countries. In
addition, nearly all the studies lack the detail necessary to con-
sider impacts in socioeconomic dimensions other than income.
As a result, important costs to various groups within the gen-
eral population may be overlooked. Important costs may also
be hidden by aggregation. This is especially relevant in studies
of the impacts of climate change and mitigation activity in
developing countries, since existing studies may overlook
major impacts to the most vulnerable individuals. Section 1.3
discusses the issue of equity in more detail and from a broader
perspective.

"The distribution of the economic impacts of mitigation policies
across economic sectors is examined in Chapter 9. Policies
such as carbon taxes or carbon caps are designed to limit car-
bon use and are likely to cause production, output, and employ-
ment to fall in the coal and oil extraction industries. The impact
on the natural gas industry is less clear. On the one hand, a car-
bon tax raises the cost of supplying natural gas, which tends to
imply reduced demands, output, and employment in this indus-
try. On the other hand, this tax raises the price of coal by a larg-
er percentage, inducing shifts in demand from coal to natural
gas. The impact of mitigation policies on renewable energy
sources is likely to vary by resource and region but are likely
to lead to larger markets for renewables. Mitigation policies are
expected to lead to structural changes in manufacturing, espe-
cially in the developed countries. Sectors that supply energy-
saving equipment and low-carbon technologies are likely to
benefit from these policies. Sectors that rely intensively on car-
bon-based fuels are expected to suffer price increases and a
loss of output.

"The term precautionary principle has been employed to express
the idea that it may be appropriate to take actions to prevent
potentially harmful climate-change outcomes. As discussed in
Chapter 10, this term has more than one meaning. A weak ver-
sion of the principle is the idea that, in the presence of uncer-
tainty, it may be prudent to engage in policies that provide
insurance against some of the potential damages from climate
change. Insuring against potentially serious damages can be
rational simply because the costs of the insurance are less than
the expected value of avoided damages. This weaker form of
the precautionary principle applies even if individuals or soci-
eties are not particularly averse to risk. In its stronger form, the
precautionary principle stipulates that nations should pursue
whatever policies are necessary to minimize the damages
under the worst possible scenario. This stronger form assumes
extreme risk-aversion, since it focuses exclusively on the worst
possible outcomes. It is clear, though, that there are costs asso-
ciated with climate policies that could, under some circum-
stances, impose large costs on particular peoples and/or
nations; but neither form of the precautionary principle has yet
been applied to this side of the climate calculus.

reducing emissions of other GHGs (like methane and nitrous

cies, their implications for other environmental concerns can
also be calculated. For example, the implied impact of climate

high that they have major health impacts, and the land-use
requirements for a global energy industry based on a very large
biomass could potentially crowd out agriculture, forestry, and
the recreational use of land.

measures of sustainability can be examined explicitly. This
kind of analysis can support, though, only a limited treatment
of sustainable development. A more in-depth treatment has

the baseline. However, other activities have important conse-
quences for climate change. For example, policies oriented
towards local air pollution—-such as controls on hydrocarbon
emissions from automobiles—affect levels of emissions of CO,
as well as the formation of tropospheric ozone, and thus have
consequences for climate. Moreover, as discussed below, some
policies, such as poverty alleviation, may ultimately have sig-

"It is not surprising that changes in the economy resulting from
climate policy may be small compared to changes that may
occur in response to other trends in the economy and to other
policies. This is so because most the GHG emissions occur in
energy production, which forms a relatively low percentage of
the economy (no more than 5%—10%). In principle, rearrang-
ing energy use as one element of a mitigation strategy need not
be a major shock to the economy if it is done efficiently.
Important also is that the costs of mitigation are likely to vary
substantially among nations because of both differences in
baseline emissions trends and differences in flexibility to
accomplish the emissions reductions required (see also
Schneider (1998) on this subject).

"In addition to the direct benefits of GHG mitigation represent-
ed in terms of reductions in impacts resulting from climate
change, the cost-effectiveness perspective also considers bene-
fits from reductions in other pollutants* that may accompany
the GHG emission reductions. Given the focus on climate
change mitigation as the primary objective the term used most
often is “ancillary benefits” (see also Chapter 8). The term “co-
benefits” is used for situations where climate change and other
environmental or socioeconomic objectives are equally impor-
tant. That notion comes more naturally from the sustainability
perspective and reflects that most policies designed to address
GHG mitigation also have other, often at least equally impor-
tant, rationales, e.g. related to development, equity and sus-
tainability.

"Human welfare and the state of the environment (which may
be a determinant of human welfare, but one that is the focus of
this assessment report) depend both on the baseline path and on
the policy-induced departures from the baseline. A striking
conclusion from Chapter 2 is that the differences in human
welfare across plausible baselines can be greater than the wel-
fare impacts of mitigation policies. That is, the nature of the
baseline—which reflects a wide range of human decisions and
policies outside of the climate-policy arena—can be more
important than the departures from that baseline caused by cli-
mate policy. The lower the level of baseline GHG emissions,
the smaller is the effort required to achieve any specific emis-
sions or concentration target. This does not eliminate the
importance of policy actions to mitigate climate change, but it
reveals the importance of developments that occur outside
what is typically regarded as “climate policy”.

They also house a less than proportionate fraction of R&D

environmental change, which are strongly science-driven areas

linked to the ability to emit unlimited amounts of carbon.

from emission increases.

"The current global response to this situation is to exempt non-
Annex I countries from climate obligations to allow them to pur-

the CDM to enable developing countries to contribute to emis-

"As non-Annex I emissions continue to grow, however, this
strategy may become inadequate, and more innovative mitiga-

will mean divergences of the development path of the current-

have displayed (Munasinghe, 1994; Jacoby et al., 1998; Najam
and Sagar, 1998; Barrett, 1999). As the UNDP Human
Development Report (1998, p.7) points out, “Poor countries
need to accelerate their consumption growth — but they need
not follow the path taken by the rich and high-growth

"However, mitigation policies in general, and its decoupling
from economic growth in particular, have to be designed with
specific contexts in mind. Policies designed for one context are
generally not appropriate for another (Shue, 1993; Rahman,
1996; Jepma and Munasinghe, 1998), and identical ultimate
goals—stabilization of GHG accumulation and maintenance or
achievement of the quality of life—yield different priorities and
strategies in Annex I and non-Annex | countries. In the former,
these goals are translated as reducing emissions while improv-
ing the quality of life, and in the latter it is the other way
around—improving the quality of life, inter alia, by maintaining
the rate of economic growth, while maintaining or lowering per
capita emissions.

"This framing of the mitigation challenge is central to the liter-
ature on global equity and climate change. Virtually all stabi-
lization trajectories in the literature show an initially rising
trend of aggregate global emissions, followed by a declining
trend; and they also show a gradual narrowing of the gap
between per capita emissions of various countries and regions.
In many of these scenarios, over a finite period of time, aggre-
gate net global emissions contract to levels consistent with the
absorptive capacity of global sinks, while per capita emissions
of Annex I and non-Annex I countries move towards conver-
gence in the interest of global equity. One possible internation-
al regime to achieve stabilization would initially have only
Annex | emissions decline over a period of time (to make room
for the growth prospects and therefore rising emissions of non-
Annex I| countries). At the same time, as per capita emissions
"	Text
"sions are slightly more than 3 tonnes per year in Annex I coun-
tries and slightly less than 0.5 tonnes per year in non-Annex I
countries. With about 1.3 billion people living in Annex I coun-
tries and about 4.7 billion in non-Annex I countries, total car-
bon emissions are in the range of (3.1)(1.3) + (0.48)(4.7) = 6.29
billion tonnes. Thus carbon emissions at a global scale average
about | tonne per capita per year. The stabilization of CO, con-
centrations in the atmosphere at 450, 550, 650, and 750ppmv
will require steep declines in the aggregate emissions as well
emissions per capita and per dollar of gross domestic product
(GDP) as illustrated in the IPCC SAR Synthesis Report (IPCC,
1996). For example, based on the SAR Synthesis Report and a
recent set of calculations by Bolin and Kheshgi (2000), stabi-
lization of CO, concentrations in the atmosphere at 450, 550,
650, and 750ppmv would require limiting fossil-fuel carbon
emissions at about 3, 6, 9 and 12 billion tonnes, respectively,
by 2100 and further reductions thereafter to less than half cur-
rent global emissions. If, for example, the world population
stabilized at about 10 billion people by then, an average carbon
emissions per capita of 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, and 1.2 tonnes of carbon
would be required to achieve the 450, 550, 650, and 750ppmv
limits, respectively. We make no assumption here about how
these emissions would or should be allocated globally, but sim-
ply report that the average by 2100 must work out to these lev-
els to achieve the stabilization objectives. Thus, to achieve a
450ppmv concentration target, average carbon emissions per
capita globally need to drop from about 1 tonne today to about
0.3 tons in 2100; to achieve a 650ppmv target they need to drop
to 0.9 tonnes (about one-quarter of current emissions per capi-
ta in the Annex I countries) by 2100 and further thereafter.
Finally, with a global economy currently producing about 25
trillion dollars of output, carbon emissions per million dollars
of output are currently about 240 tonnes. If, for example, the
global economy grows to 200 trillion dollars of output by 2100,
the emissions per million dollars (in year 2000 dollars) would
need to be limited to about 10, 25, 40, and 55 tonnes of carbon
in order to achieve the 450, 550, 650, and 750ppmv co, lim-
its, respectively. If further population and economic growth
continues beyond 2100 additional reductions in average emis-
sions per capita and per unit of economic output would be
required.

"For the purposes of this chapter, it is convenient to divide the
required emissions trajectory into three segments. Phase 1, an
upward sloping segment of the non-Annex I trajectory, may
require only marginal deviations in baseline emissions, for
which the assessment of policy options entails a central atten-
tion to the costs and benefits of mitigation. However, for
options relevant for Phase 2, a downward sloping segment of
non-Annex I emissions, in which deeper cuts may be called for,
global equity issues will need greater attention. Finally, the
policy options that can help realize Phase 3, the asymptotic
segment of the trajectory, revolve to a greater extent around
sustainability concerns.

"A persistent theme in the literature is the explicit or implicit assignment of responsibility for global warming trends. Without going
into the merits of the issue, it is useful to point out that many of the arguments revolve around the appropriate way to represent the
data. For example, Agarwal and Narain (199 1a) criticize the uncritical use of aggregate national emissions figures, which could imply
parity between developed countries and large developing countries (China, India, and Brazil) mainly because of the large populations
of the latter. Instead, they recommend the use of per capita “net emissions’—that is, emissions that exceed the per capita absorptive
capacity of global carbon sinks. Other analysts distinguish between “necessary” and “luxury” emissions (Agarwal ef al., 1999; Shue,
1993).
"	Text
"Finally, “per capita” is not the only relevant normalization (Najam and Sagar, 1998), since emissions per unit of income can also indi-
cate potential for efficiency improvements. Besides annual emissions, data can also be presented in terms of atmospheric concentra-
tions, or the contribution to the global average temperature, each of which has slightly different implications for the responsibility for
climate change. Given the uncertainties involved in constructing such estimates, the picture is not entirely clear. However, most esti-
mates suggest that the developing countries may overtake Annex I countries, in terms of total annual emissions, in another 15—20 years,
and in terms of the contribution to the global average temperature increase in 60-90 years (Hasselmann et al., 1993; Enting, 1998;
Meira, 1999; Pinguelli Rosa and Ribeiro, 2000).

Ghosh, 1993). A formulation that carries this insight to its log-
ical conclusion is that of “contraction and convergence”
(Meyer, 1999), whereby net aggregate emissions decline to
zero, and per capita emissions of Annex I and non-Annex I
countries reach precise equality. Initial analysis assumed an
equal per capita allocation of emission permits—or rights to the
“atmospheric commons’—but subsequent questioning led other
writers to explore equity and efficiency implications of alter-
native allocation formulas, including geographical area, his-
toric use, economic activity, or some combination of these. In
all this literature, the idea is that “surplus” countries or regions,

"Another theme is the relative impact of CO, emissions and that of other GHGs and land-use changes, given that the latter are less
strongly correlated with per capita income. Most analyses have focused on CO, emissions, given that it constitutes the bulk of the con-
tribution to global warming. Others suggests that CO, emissions are accompanied by forced cloud changes and tropospheric aerosols,
which offset their warming impact (Hansen ef al., 2000). There are also debates over the precision of the estimates of these associat-
ed offsets, as well as those of methane emissions in developing countries (Agarwal ef al., 1999). For example, Parikh er al. (1991)
identify potentially serious problems with World Resources Institute’s deforestation estimates (WRI, 1991); and Parikh (1992) shows
how the IS92 IPCC scenarios may have been formulated with developed country interests hard-wired into them such that they could
be very unfair to the developing countries. In response to this criticism some of the new SRES scenarios (IPCC, 2000a) explicitly
explore scenarios with a narrowing income gap between the developed and developing countries.

Scale. The scale of the mitigation challenge in non-
Annex I countries is projected to be much broader in
the long term than the short term. Instead of an exclu-
sive reliance on financial and technological assistance,
which ordinarily indicates increases in assistance levels
significantly above historical trends, there is a need to
invest in indigenous capacity to undertake mitigation
without compromising the development agenda.
Timing. To sustain the interest of both developed and
developing countries in co-operative solutions, the goal
must be to lower the cost of mitigation over time rather
than to concentrate simply on exhausting the cheap mit-
igation options (the so-called “low-hanging fruit”).

or as the index of the “real” or “permanent” income of a soci-
ety (see Johnson, 1964). As such, much development policy
concentrates on measures that stimulate investment and expand
the stock of capital. Each innovation has served mainly to
expand the definition of the capital stock.

"It might appear from the above that sustainable development
entails a trade-off between investment in physical capital,
social capital, and natural capital, and therefore between eco-
nomic growth, income distribution, and environmental conser-
vation. However, some branches of development theory have
ceased to view these as trade-offs. In particular, the goal of the
research on sustainable development-especially conservation
strategies and action plans—is to show that under appropriate
institutional and social conditions there is a synergy rather than
conflict between different goals (IUCN, WWF, and UNEP,
1980). Even earlier, development analysts had begun to ques-
tion the supposed trade-off between economic growth and
income distribution (World Bank, 2000; see also Kuznets,
1955; Hicks, 1979; Chenery, 1980; Fields, 1980).

"The term “sustainable development” was popularized in academic and policy circles by the Brundtland Report (WCED, 1987),
although its distinctive antecedents predate the report (especially IUCN, WWF, and UNEP, 1980). The Brundtland Commission
defines it as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their
own needs” (WCED, 1987, p. 8). However, although the ubiquity of references to this definition suggests a degree of scholarly con-
sensus, this is not the case. There is considerable disagreement on conceptual grounds and, perhaps most significantly, on its opera-
tionalization (see Lélé, 1991). Nevertheless, most scholars and practitioners accept a concern for economic prosperity (development),
ecological integrity (sustainability), and social justice (equity) as the three pillars of sustainable development (Buitenkamp ef al., 1992;
Opschoor, 1992; Munasinghe, 1993, 2000; Banuri et a/., 1994; Munasinghe and Shearer, 1995; Elkington, 1997; Carley and Spapens,

"Weak Sustainability: The weak sustainability approach asserts that the different forms of capital can substitute for one another to some
degree. The substitutability of different types of capital implies that the preservation of an aggregate level of capital, rather than the
preservation of natural capital in particular, is crucial. The weak sustainability approach is consistent with the idea that some loss of
“climate capital” could be consistent with sustainability if increases in other forms of capital could compensate for the loss.
"	Text
"Strong Sustainability. The strong sustainability approach of the so-called London school (Pearce, 1993) holds that different types of
capital are not necessarily substitutable, so that sustainability requires the maintenance of a fixed (or minimum) stock of each compo-
nent of natural capital. Under this notion, any development path that leads to an overall diminishment in the stocks of natural capital
(or to a decline below the minimum) fails to be sustainable even if other forms of capital increase.

this alone may not be reason enough to include it within the

capable of generating flows of goods and services. In this construction, development is sustainable if some aggregate index across all
forms of capital is non-decreasing.

"Similar shifts have occurred in other areas of development the-

development, for example, is increasingly argued to consist not
of the simultaneous pursuit of several independent goals, but of
investments in social capital to enable the other goals to be pur-
sued through normal market or regulatory mechanisms (Banuri
et al., 1994). Poverty eradication programmes focus increas-

through the efforts of economic agents to overcome bottle-

"It is fair to say that the development profession has increasing-

shifted from promoting growth towards promoting the capaci-
ty for growth. Development policy is concerned increasingly
with conditions that stimulate investment-trade liberalization,
structural adjustment, skill development, governance, institu-
tional development, and market access—rather than the invest-
ment itself. This is partly because the fashion has changed from
public to private investment, and partly because a large body of
research shows that, while the scarcity of financial resources
can inhibit the growth process, inflows do not necessarily pro-
mote it (Bauer and Yamey, 1982). For example, a recent review
of cross-country experience (World Bank, 1998) discovered
that the net impact of foreign resource inflows depends criti-
cally on ancillary factors-the nature of domestic policies, the
fiscal stance, the institutions of governance, and the openness

Conceptually speaking, this literature takes two forms. The

search for options with which certain normative goals might be

Thompson et al. (1986), be a useful response to situations char-
acterized by a high degree of ignorance, for which it is difficult
to assess the probabilities of possible outcomes or even to
know what those possible outcomes might be. Although there
is a scientific consensus that anthropogenic climate change is
occurring, there is considerable uncertainty about the rate of
expected change and its manifestations and impacts at the
regional and global levels (see IPCC, 2001, Chapter 19).
Science cannot predict the climate and its impacts in
Milwaukee, Mumbai, or Moscow half a century ahead very
accurately, and it may never be able to do so. Moreover, these
types of predictions also require scenarios of the social, eco-
nomic, and technological paths that the world will follow over
the same period (see Chapter 2)—knowledge that may be fur-
ther beyond our reach than climate prediction. Moreover, this
uncertainty increases with the time scale.

"The bulk of this literature starts with the recognition that long-
term sustainability can imply an appropriate scale of resource
flows, in society (Daly, 1997). Taking a society of appropriate
physical scale as a desirable future, this literature goes on to
works backwards (backcasts) through possible development
paths that may lead from present-day society to a more sus-
tainable, and in the case of concerns about climate change,
low-carbon society. Authors who write from this perspective
usually assume that resource availability, technology, and soci-
ety move forwards in a co-evolutionary fashion (Norgaard,
1994). They work on the hypothesis that the transition to bal-
anced and sustainable resource flows implies concomitant
changes in technologies, institutions, lifestyles, and world-
views. Though this research takes a certain state of sustainabil-
ity as its point of departure, it is also sensitive to the principles
of equity and cost-effectiveness. It tends to view these as sec-
ond-order principles that provide structure to the pursuit of sus-
tainability, the first-order principle. In a sense, this literature
can be viewed as the mirror image of the studies reviewed ear-
lier—studies that justify the pursuit of sustainability on the
grounds of efficiency and equity.

"This perspective becomes relevant when it is placed in the con-
text of concerns about unsustainability (loss of biological
diversity, extinction of species, air and water pollution, defor-
estation, desertification, persistent poverty, and rising inequal-
ity both within and between nations, and so on). These con-
cerns are derived from underlying pressures imposed by the
growth of consumption and population and the inability of
many people and communities to protect their health and liveli-
hoods against these damages. Climate change is thus a poten-
tially critical factor in the larger process of society’s adaptive
response to changing historical conditions through its choice of
developmental paths (Cohen ef al., 1998, p. 360). Chapter 2 of
this report (based on the IPCC (2000a) Special Report on
Emissions Scenarios (SRES)) notes, for example, that future
emissions will be determined not just by climate policy, but
also and more importantly by the “world” in which we will
live. Decisions about technology, investment, trade, poverty,
biodiversity, community rights, social policies, or governance,
which may seem unrelated to climate policy, may have pro-
found impacts upon emissions, the extent of mitigation
required, and the cost and benefits that result. Conversely, cli-
mate policies that implicitly address social, environmental,
economic, and security issues may turn out to be important
levers for creating a sustainable world (Reddy et al., 1997, p.
6).

"The high degree of uncertainty under which climate policy
must be developed has important implications for the type of
policy regimes likely to be most effective. There is a high
degree of uncertainty about how ecosystems would respond to
climate change in the studies reviewed here. This recognition
suggests that a portfolio approach that includes a broad range
of policies diversified across all the major uncertainties might
be better than betting on any one particular set of outcomes.
Some studies have even drawn a direct parallel between the
value of biological diversity and the diversity of institutions
and worldviews that contribute to the social capital necessary
to maintain the sustainability of human societies (Rayner and
Malone, 1998b). Stressing the relationship between risk,
resilience, and governance, these authors argue that rather than
seeking to anticipate and fix particular problems, the purpose
of policy should be to develop coping capacity. This would
both switch development and environmental management
strategies more nimbly as scientific information improves and
strengthen the resilience of vulnerable communities to climate
impacts. Conditions of deep uncertainty make it rational for
societies to focus on increasing their resilience and flexibility.
Resilience in the face of unknown challenges, this research
argues, may be achieved by relying on the formation of values
and worldviews that embrace the goal of long-term sustain-
ability, at least until some of the key uncertainties are resolved
to the point that pursuit of a more narrowly focused policy
regime can be justified.

policies of society are being set, rather than downstream after
the costs of unsustainable development have already been
incurred (Schmidt-Bleek, 1994; Factor 10 Club, 1995). For
this reason, they often adopt the industrial metabolism
approach, focussing on the flow of materials and energy in
modern society through the chain of extraction, production,
consumption, and disposal (Ayres and Simonis, 1994; Fischer-
Kowalski et al., 1997; Opschoor, 1997). It is argued that the
pressure the human economy exerts on the environment
depends on levels and patterns of these flows between the
economy and the biosphere. Within this conceptual frame-
work, sustainability requires reductions in the overall level of
resource flows, particularly the primary flow of (fossil) mate-
rials and energy at the input side. Trajectories of emissions
reduction of the sort described above can, therefore, be taken
as rough indicators for the order of magnitude of the changes
involved in the transition to long-term sustainability. In light of
this perspective, a number of studies of developed countries
(Buitenkamp ef al., 1992; McLaren et al., 1997; Carley and
Spapens, 1998; Sachs et al., 1998; Bologna et al., 2000) have
attempted to backcast a transition to a society capable of cre-
ating human welfare with a constantly diminishing amount of
natural resources. Certainly, scenarios that explore such out-
comes are not restricted to decarbonization or a trend toward
carbon sequestration. They may, however, view policies that
facilitate these trends as vehicles for nudging the world
towards a sustainable future.

on wood for its basic fuel needs; but research and policy design

Solar energy has a significant potential in sahelian Africa, but
slow technological progress, high unit costs, and the absence of
technology transfer have retarded its installation. The Brazilian

"In a complementary strand of literature attention has focused
on the greater scope for a transition in developing countries by
decoupling investment from resource depletion and the
destruction of ecological processes. More specifically, since
the physical infrastructure in developing countries is still being
designed and installed, they have a better opportunity to avoid
the resource-intensive trajectories of infrastructural evolution
adopted by developed countries (Shukla ef al., 1998, p. 53;
Goldemberg, 1998a). Specific examples cited in this context
are efficient rail systems, decentralized energy production,
public transport, grey-water sewage systems, surface irrigation
systems, regionalized food systems, and dense urban settle-
ment clusters. These can set a country on the road towards
cleaner, less costly, more equitable, and less emission-intensive
development patterns. The costs of such a transition are proba-
bly higher in places where considerable capital investments in
infrastructures have already been made and where turnover is
rather slow. For this reason, the timing of such choices is vital,
as decisions about systemic technological solutions tend to
lock economies onto a path with a specific resource and emis-

of engines, through an agreement between the government and multinational car companies in Brazil. The conversion was driven pri-

because they build upon the indigenous knowledge and capa-
bilities of local communities; produce locally needed materi-
als, use natural resources in a sustainable fashion, and help to
regenerate the natural resource base. They may enable devel-
oping countries to keep an acceptable environmental quality
within a controlled cost (Hou, 1988). Low-cost, but resource-
efficient technologies are of particular importance for the rural
and urban poor (see Box 1.5). There is a latent demand for low-
cost housing, small hydropower units, low-input organic agri-
culture, local non-grid power stations, and biomass-based
small industries. Sustainable agriculture can benefit both the
environment and food production. Biomass-based energy
plants could produce electricity from local waste materials in
an efficient, low-cost, and carbon-free manner. Each of these
options needs to be evaluated alongside conventional energy
supply and demand alternatives (see Chapter 3) in terms of the
impacts and contribution to sustainable development.
Expanding the analysis of the set of available options in this
way should make us better off, as some of the new options will
be attractive upon further analysis, although others will not.

options identified along these four dimensions emerge from a

not, however, been reported in the literature under review.
Moreover, most authors are ready to admit that the conditions

"Creating an improved, or at least a different, way of life sup-
ported by a given set of natural inputs could also enhance the
overall resource productivity in society. For developed coun-
tries (and the corresponding social sections in developing
countries) pursuing such an objective might start from the
insight offered by some research that there is no clear link
between level of GNP and quality of life (or satisfaction)
beyond certain thresholds. Linton (1998) and UNDP (1998)
draw this distinction clearly. Both sources argue that the qual-
ity of life is determined by subjective and non-subjective vari-
ables. On the subjective side, quality of life depends upon per-
sonal satisfaction, which in part depends on shared preferences
and institutional values. On the non-subjective side, it depends
upon opportunity structures, which may include access to
nature, participation in community, availability of non-market
goods, or public wealth, in addition to purchasing power. This
literature describes situations in which GNP growth continues
without a corresponding increase in human welfare as “overde-
velopment” or “uneconomic growth” (Daly, 1997). For devel-
oping countries, however, the research suggests that this
decoupling perspective may start from the insight that non-
monetary assets (in terms of natural resources, just as in terms
of community networks) need to be protected and enhanced to
improve the livelihoods of the poorer and less powerful sec-
tions of society. Structures, patterns, and rates of economic
growth may have to be shaped in such a way that these non-
monetary assets are not diminished, but increased.

increase wellbeing at the same rate. They suggest that individ-

as the ability to maintain and/or increase satisfaction with
lower and/or intermediate input of resources. Some authors
consider intervention in the prevailing narrative of consump-
tion—‘more (consumption) is better’—a possible strategy to
interrupt the satisfaction—-consumption cycle (Common, 1995;
Lichtenberg, 1996; Schor, 1998). These approaches draw their
motivation from the hypothesis that, ecologically, it is not only
the pattern, but also the overall scale of consumption that mat-
ters. If this is correct, then social capital in its broadest sense
might have to substitute for increased absolute volumes of con-
sumption (Robinson and Herbert, 2000). Chapters 5 and 10

utility of more free time increases faster than the marginal util-
ity of more purchasing power for the more affluent parts of
society (Schor, 1998). Choosing more wealth in time rather
than more wealth in goods and services can be seen as a viable
option, which promises to increase freedom while containing
consumption levels. Finally, under conditions of “reflexive
modernization” (Beck, 1991), consumption styles might
emerge that put more emphasis on quality and non-material
satisfaction rather than on rising volumes of consumption
(Durning, 1992). As consumption activities become reinserted

may be found between satisfaction derived from the market-

"Production and lifestyles based on high volumes of long-dis-
tance transportation carry a relatively high load of energy and
raw materials. Some researchers argue (Shuman, 1998;
Magnaghi, 2000) that a low-input society may require that the
economy evolves in a plurality of spaces, in which markets that
work with “regional sourcing” and “regional marketing” can co-
exist with markets that focus on “global sourcing” and “global
marketing”. Avoiding demand for transport rather than just opti-
mizing the modal split between private and public means of
transport is often considered the objective of sustainable policies
(Whitelegg, 1993), and regionalized economies may be best
suited to this objective. Moreover, solar power, which relies on
the widespread but diffuse resource of sunlight, may be best
developed when many operators harvest small amounts of ener-
gy, transforming and consuming the resource at close distance.
A similar logic holds for biomass-centred technologies. Plant
matter is widespread, available, and heavy in weight; it may be
best obtained and processed in a decentralized fashion. For this
reason, some analysts argue that a resource-light economy has to
be, in part, a regionalized economy. On the other hand, Chapter
2 points out that regionalization may impede technology trans-

goods and natural habitats for important inputs into the pro-

"To include issues of cost-effectiveness, distribution (narrowly
defined), equity (more broadly defined), and sustainability
adds enormous complexity to discussions on the problem of
how nations can respond best to the threat of climate change.
Indeed, recognition that these multiple domains are relevant
complicates the task assigned to policymakers and internation-
al negotiators by opening their deliberations to issues that lie
beyond the boundaries of the climate change problem, per se.
Their recognition thereby underscores the need to integrate sci-
entific thought across a wide range of new policy-relevant con-
texts, but not simply because of some abstract academic or nar-
row parochial interest advanced by a small set of researchers or
nations. Cost-effectiveness, equity, and sustainability have all

"Yohe (2001, in press) has recently introduced mitigative capac-

as they try to accomplish this integration. Briefly defined, a
nation’s mitigative capacity reflects its ability to diminish the
intensity of the natural (and other) stresses to which it might be
exposed. The list of stresses for any particular nation might
include climate change and climate variability, of course. It fol-
lows that to review the diversity of the determinants of mitiga-

who contribute to IPCC Assessments and researchers who will
look to their report for guidance in setting their research agen-
das. These determinants can, in short, provide a framework
upon which to build and through which to assess systematic
and comparable representations of nations’ relative capacities
to cope. Mitigative capacity is therefore offered here as one
means with which to integrate and to evaluate the complex
issues that have emerged since the publication of SAR. There
may be other means to the same end, of course, but a focus on

framework upon which to build systematic and comparable

ameliorate or exploit the impacts of the natural or social stress-
es that they might face. As such, adaptive capacity plays a sim-
ilar organizational role for WGII in their assessment of impacts
as mitigative capacity does herein. WGII authors built their
assessments around the notion that a system’s vulnerability to
climate change is determined both by its exposure to the
impacts of climate change and by its adaptive capacity. Their
analysis uncovered a list of determinants for adaptive capacity
that is nearly identical to the list of determinants for mitigative

are critical; however, a technology could be expensive in one
place and relatively inexpensive in another; or it may be inex-

when denominated in another (see Schneider, 1999). Chapter 5
also highlights social and economic constraints derived from
high private discount rates, market failures, closed economies,
uneven allocations of resources, uneven access to decision-

context of their own countries, for which data and information
may be scarce or, in cases where prices do not reflect social
cost, misleading. Clearly, these observations extend the discus-

individuals engaging in both production and consumption deci-
sions—to undertake actions that lead to the mitigation of GHGs.
There is, in short, a multitude of policy options and instruments
available to decision makers at various levels.

"Uncertainty, vulnerability to shocks, and attitudes towards risk
influence the perceived legitimacy of various decision options.
At a global or national level, public opinion and therefore pub-
lic policy is affected by the scientific uncertainty over the range
and impact of climate change. At subnational levels, such
uncertainty and vulnerability lies not only in the future, but
also in the present circumstances of specific groups—the poor,
the communities living in fragile or threatened areas, and the
ecological refugees (Gadgil and Guha, 1995). It shapes the col-
lective experience of such groups, determines their decision
objectives, and affects their choices as well as susceptibility to
policy-induced changes.

"The role of information depends critically on the legitimacy of
institutions that provide it. The capacity for research, analysis,
and policy development is generally weak in developing coun-
tries, and especially so in terms of climate change. More
importantly, this limited capacity is focused exclusively at the
national level. The result is often a credibility gap between the

In others, it may simply be that separate agencies are responsi-

"The role of the informal sector can also differ between devel-
oped and developing countries (see, e.g., Cantor ef al., 1992).
Although the term is defined somewhat loosely in the litera-
ture—often referring to urban, small-scale, non-organized eco-
nomic activities, and elsewhere to activities not covered in
national tax nets—estimates suggest that the informal economy
may cover as much as one-third of the economic activity of
some developing countries. Given its relative imperviousness
to analysis as well as policy influence (indeed, its very exis-
tence is credited by some writers to its ability to escape policy
influence), it is difficult to project how this sector will react to

"tiations and compromises between them. As a result,
O’Riordan et al., 1998) argue that issues considered by gov-
ernments to be on the policy periphery, like climate change, are
not easily factored into consideration of issues at the policy
core (such as health care, education, national economic policy,
or corporate manufacturing strategy). The issue networks and
policy communities around environmental ministries in most
countries are weak relative to those around economic and
defence ministries. Climate change is sometimes invoked to
boost support for existing policy agendas, such as industrial
restructuring. Nonetheless, climate change has seldom, if ever,
been perceived within the powerful ministries and their policy
communities as sufficiently threatening to their departmental
interests to fundamentally change those agendas (O’Riordan
and Jager, 1996; Beuerman and Jager, 1996).
"	Text
"The prospect of climate change is just one of many issues of
concern to governments, and in most countries climate policy
is debated within a broader framework. National policymakers,
therefore, have to make trade-offs in implementing climate
policies within a comprehensive national and international
political economy framework. Many political parties and
stakeholder groups oppose climate policy because of perceived
conflicts with private sector interests. They also perceive con-
flicts with traditional macroeconomic goals, like full employ-
ment, price stability, and international competitiveness. They
also sometimes fear competition with other traditional objec-
tives for public attention and public expenditure (e.g., health
care, national security, infrastructure, and education).
Likewise, some people may resist mitigation policies (regard-
less of who pays for them) because of the perceived adverse
impacts on economic growth and poverty eradication, even
though others might suggest that the implementation of such
policies could provide potential opportunities for sustainable
development.
"	Text
"There is, as well, enormous variety in the range of institution-
al and other conditions in various countries at the subnational
level. The political decision-making process in developed
countries is affected to a certain degree by powerful non-gov-
ernmental institutions—including corporations and issue-based
non-governmental organizations (NGOs; March and Rhodes,
1992; Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith, 1993; Smith, 1993;
Michaelowa, 1998; O’Riordan er al., 1998). These can be a
source of resources and new ideas to address climate change as
it occurs, but they can also impede the identification and
response to changes because of vested interests in the current
or some desired allocation of resources. In developing coun-
tries, a growing number of institutions have emerged to cham-
pion environmental agendas. These range from groups con-
cerned with narrowly defined problems and opportunities (e.g.,
grassroots groups, wetlands protection groups) to broad-based
rights groups (e.g. women’s groups) that address a range of
common problems (see, e.g., Banuri et al., 1994). However,
significant differences continue between the legitimacy and
reach of such groups in the developed and developing regions.

"Decisions that lead to the emissions of GHGs that result in
global warming are made under, and generally because of, the
system of incentives and institutions in place, and are based on
the information available to decision makers. Influencing such
decisions requires policy intervention at global, national, or
local levels. Conversely, the existence of institutions and legit-
imacy determines the effectiveness of the menu of potential
governmental policies outlined above. There is significant het-
erogeneity within most countries in the types of climate change
impacts that might be expected and in the likely impact of
GHG mitigation policies. The ability to adapt to climate
change depends on the level of income and technology, as well
as the capacity of the system of governance and existing insti-
tutions to cope with change. The ability to mitigate GHG emis-
sions depends on industrial structure (the mix of industrial
activities), social structure (including, e.g., the distance people
must travel to work or to engage in recreational activities), the
nature of governance (especially the effectiveness of govern-
ment policy), and the availability and cost of alternatives. In
short, what is feasible at the national level depends significant-
ly on what can be done at the subnational, local, and various
sectoral levels. However, most studies assume that the nation-
al level is the most appropriate for assessing and reacting to the
externalities that result from emissions of GHGs and for nego-
tiating international climate change agreements.

"One such lesson is that to aggregate representations of mitiga-
tion across nations and/or groups may be misleading. Quite
simply, the capacity to reduce emissions of GHGs can vary
dramatically from nation to nation, sector to sector, region to
region, group to group, and timeframe to timeframe.
"	Text
"Countries most vulnerable to climate change may have the
smallest mitigative capacity. Vulnerability to climate change
results from high exposure to climate impacts, low adaptive
capacity, or both. In the high-exposure case, the opportunity
cost, broadly defined, of expending resources to mitigate GHG
emissions may be too high. In the case of low adaptive capac-
ity, the factors responsible may also work to diminish mitiga-
tive capacity. And in the third case, both deleterious correla-
tions could work to complement each other.
"	Text
"Secondly, one country can easily display high adaptive capac-
ity and low mitigative capacity simultaneously (or visa versa),
even though both capacities share the same list of determi-
nants. In a wealthy nation the damages associated with climate
change may focus on a small but well-connected group of peo-
ple, while the cost of a wide range of adaptation options can,
through a well established tax system, be distributed across the
entire population. The same country might, however, include
another small group of people who would be seriously hurt by
most if not all of the wide range of available mitigation options
"	Text
"Taken together, these insights suggest a need for investment in
the research and analytical capacity of the developing coun-
tries, and for orienting the research effort in both developing
and developed countries towards the local impacts of climate
change and the capacity for climate change adaptation and mit-
igation. Section 1.5.2 indicates how approaching this complex-
ity within the organizing concept of mitigative capacity can
help to generate insights into interpreting and extending ana-
lytical exercises, integrating these exercises across multiple
stresses, and using this integration to inform discussions and
debates in the policy arena.

"More importantly, the bulk of the research and analytical capac-
ity at the global level is concentrated in the developed coun-
tries. This is true especially of climate modelling, but also in
analyses of the relationship between climate change and sus-
tainable development. Since the late 1980s, massive investment
in climate change research has taken place in the developed
countries. In contrast, there is a paucity of research institutions
in developing countries, with a relatively small level of research
effort and investment. This is adequate neither for policy devel-
opment nor for reassuring policymakers and NGOs of the
developing region that the research results are unbiased (Sagar,
1999),?8
"	Text
"Enhancing any one component of mitigative capacity may (or
may not) reduce the (marginal) cost of mitigation, because it
either expands the set of possible mitigative options or because
it reduces the constraints that stand in the way of their efficient
application. Adding to the list of available technological
options can, of course, lower the cost of implementing a spe-
cific policy designed to accomplish a specific objective, but the
additions must be more socially acceptable than the existing
alternatives, as well as structurally, socially, politically, and
culturally feasible. If not, they will not be adopted.
Furthermore, their informational requirements must not exceed
the informational capacity of the host country.

"A nation, region, or community’s international position can
play a significant role in determining its ability to exercise its
mitigative capacity, because outside entities can influence the
effectiveness of technological options and/or domestic policy
alternatives. External forces can have a secondary but nonethe-
less significant effect on the likelihood that mitigation will
occur. Section 1.2 highlights the value of international co-ordi-
nation. Trade policies, be they global or the domestic policies
of significant trading partners, directly influence national
incomes and their distribution. Trade also influences the degree
to which a country’s development plans put pressure on its
stocks of social, human, and natural capital. Each of these fac-
tors subsequently affects the constraints that determine the set

sustainability goals, equity goals, and development goals. In
this light, mitigative capacity highlights the necessity to
observe market failures, political failures, and other failures
that might otherwise be overlooked. The fundamental ques-
tions are, then, ones of a broad perspective to see exactly how
much public policy should be devoted to enhancing mitigative
capacity in ways that can help answer questions like “Where
are the payoffs clearly greater than the costs?” or “Where is the
low-hanging fruit that deserves picking?”
"	Text
"Contemplating the complexity of mitigative capacity reveals
that the sources of uncertainty in understanding mitigation
extend far beyond the boundaries of the uncertainties that
cloud how various technologies might be applied and how var-
ious policy designs might function. The same determinants of
mitigative capacity that bring development, equity, and sus-
tainability factors into play add to the list of these sources, just
as they do on the impact side of the climate change calculus. In
short, therefore, anticipating how mitigation might evolve,
how much it might cost, how effective it might be, and how the
costs and benefits might be distributed is just as uncertain as
anticipating how systems might adapt to the impacts of climate
change and climate variability.
"	Text
"Concepts like mitigative capacity can help to clarify the trade-
offs within and between this expanded range of options. It can
show how the assessment of climate change mitigation oppor-
tunities contained in this volume can be used and integrated to
confront the problem of climate change most effectively. This
is especially true when the broad lessons from WGIII herein
are taken in concert with lessons drawn from the assessment
provided by WGII (IPCC, 2001) on impacts and adaptation.
Many of the determinants of adaptive capacity are essentially
the same as those of mitigative capacity. Therefore, a portfolio
of policy strategies that enhances the capacity to mitigate most
effectively should also be effective in enhancing the capacity to
adapt. A number of lessons and directions for future research
can be enumerated.
"	Text
"Understanding the determinants of mitigative capacity offers a
way of organizing not only the analysis of mitigation, but also
the negotiations over how to meet the mitigation challenge.
Indeed, enhancing mitigative capacity can be a policy objec-
tive in and of itself. The means by which this enhancement
might be accomplished can be drawn directly from an under-
standing of how the determinants work within and across
countries, how they might complement one another, and how
they might conflict. Of course, the opportunity cost of enhanc-
ing mitigative capacity, measured in terms of cost of regress-
ing against other objectives, is critical in evaluating its desir-
ability. It is also clear, given the way in which its determinants
can be expected to interact, that enhancing mitigative capaci-
ty means more than simply transferring resources from one
nation to another. Weakness beyond access to adequate
resources can surely impede the capacity to mitigate any
stress; and so it follows that these weaknesses can undermine
significantly the efficacy of offering or requesting simple
financial support.

"¢ Much additional research is needed before concepts like
mitigative capacity can be used to assess the relative mer-
its of specific options.

"Integrating concepts like mitigative capacity should prove use-
ful as a heuristic device to integrate diverse policy instruments
into a comprehensive policy portfolio, to discover the metrics
with which costs and benefits should be measured, and (per-
haps most immediately) to broaden the range of no regrets
options.

"and how synergies and conflicts between mitigation and adap-
tation might arise. Focusing research on these determinants
also makes it clear that policy making in either sphere can be
matched by complementary action in the other. Coping with
the climate problem is not a question of mitigating and then
adapting. Nor is it a question of adapting and then mitigating.
It is a more holistic question of doing both at the same time;
focusing attention on the common determinants of mitigative
and adaptive capacities can lead productively to an under-
standing of exactly how to meet these coincident challenges.

emissions or concentration levels to reflect measures that are
taken to implement such options. Regional targets are intro-

"These mitigation scenarios include concentration stabilization
scenarios, emission stabilization scenarios, tolerable win-

greenhouse gases (GHGs).

"Each mitigation scenario describes a future world with partic-
ular economic, social, and environmental characteristics, and
therefore implicitly or explicitly contains information about
development, equity, and sustainability (DES). Since the dif-
ference between reference case scenarios and their correspond-
ing mitigation scenarios is simply the addition of deliberate cli-
mate policy, it can be the case that the differences in emissions
among reference case scenarios are greater than between any
one such scenario and its mitigation version.
"	Text
"There was a wide range in baselines, reflecting a diversity of
assumptions, mainly with respect to economic growth and low-
carbon energy supply. High economic growth scenarios tend to
assume high levels of progress in the efficiency of end-use
technologies; carbon intensity reductions were found to be
largely independent of economic growth assumptions. The
range of future trends shows greater divergence in scenarios
that focus on developing countries than in scenarios that look
at developed nations. There is little consensus with respect to
future directions in developing regions.
"	Text
"The reviewed 550ppmv stabilization scenarios vary with
respect to reduction time paths and the distribution of emission
reductions among regions. Some scenarios show that emission
trading lowers overall mitigation cost by shifting mitigation to
non-OECD countries, where abatement costs are assumed to
be lower. The range of assumed mitigation policies is very
wide. In general, scenarios in which there is an assumed adop-
tion of high-efficiency measures in the baseline show less
scope for further introduction of efficiency measures in the
mitigation scenarios. In part this is due to the structure of the
models, which do not assume major technological break-

"Asurvey of this literature has yielded a number of insights. First,
a wide range of future conditions has been identified by futurists,
ranging from variants of sustainable development to collapse of
social, economic, and environmental systems. Since the underly-
ing socio-economic drivers of emissions may vary widely in the
future, it is important that climate policies should be designed so
that they are resilient against widely different future conditions.
"	Text
"Only a small set of studies has reported on scenarios for miti-
gating non-CO, gases. This literature suggests that small reduc-
tions of GHG emissions can be accomplished at lower cost by
including non-CO, gases; that both CO, and non-CO, emissions
would have to be controlled in order to reduce emissions suffi-
ciently to meet assumed mitigation targets; and that methane
(CH,) mitigation can be carried out more rapidly, with a more
immediate impact on the atmosphere, than CO, mitigation.

"throughs. Conversely, baseline scenarios with high carbon
intensity reductions show larger carbon intensity reductions in
their corresponding mitigation scenarios. Global macroeco-
nomic costs of mitigation in the reviewed scenarios range from
0% to 3.5% of gross domestic product (GDP), while a few sim-
ple models estimate more increase in the second half of the 21
century. No clear relationship was discovered between the
GDP loss and the GDP growth assumptions in the baselines.

"Global futures scenarios do not specifically or uniquely con-
sider GHG emissions. Instead, they are more general “stories”
of possible future worlds. They can complement the more
quantitative emission scenario assessment because they con-
sider dimensions that elude quantification, such as governance
and social structures and institutions, but which are nonethe-
less important to the success of mitigation policies. Addressing
these issues reflects the different perspectives presented in
Chapter 1 on cost-effectiveness, equity, and sustainability.
"	Text
"Second, the global futures scenarios that show falling GHG
emissions tend to show improved governance, increased equi-
ty and political participation, reduced conflict, and improved
environmental quality. They also tend to show increased ener-
gy efficiency, shifts to non-fossil energy sources, and/or shifts
to a post-industrial economy. Furthermore, population tends to
stabilize at relatively low levels, in many cases as a result of
increased prosperity, expanded provision of family planning,
and improved rights and opportunities for women. A key impli-
cation is that sustainable development policies can make a sig-
nificant contribution to emission reduction.

"Six new GHG emission reference scenario groups (not includ-
ing specific climate policy initiatives), organised into 4 sce-
nario “families”, were developed by the IPCC and published as
the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES). Scenario
families Al and A2 emphasize economic development but dif-
fer with respect to the degree of economic and social conver-
gence; B1 and B2 emphasize sustainable development but also
differ in terms of degree of convergence. In all, six models
were used to generate 40 scenarios that comprise the six sce-
nario groups. In each group of scenarios, which should be con-
sidered equally sound, one illustrative case was chosen to illus-
trate the whole set of scenarios. These six scenarios include
marker scenarios for each of the scenario families as well as
two scenarios, AIFI and AIT, which illustrate alternative ener-
gy technology developments in the Al world.

Alternative combinations of driving-force variables can
lead to similar levels and structure of energy use, land-
use patterns and emissions.

Important possibilities for further bifurcations in future
development trends exist within each scenario family.
Emissions profiles are dynamic across the range of
SRES scenarios. They portray trend reversals and indi-
cate possible emissions cross-over among different sce-
narios.

Describing potential future developments involves
inherent ambiguities and uncertainties. One and only
one possible development path (as alluded to for
instance in concepts such as “business-as-usual sce-
nario”) simply does not exist. The multi-model
approach increases the value of any scenario set, since
uncertainties in the choice of model input assumptions
can be more explicitly separated from the specific
model behaviour and related modelling uncertainties.

tion in the economy-emphasized worlds (A1F1, A1B, and A2),

"The reduction in energy use caused by climate policies would
be larger in Annex | than in non-Annex I. However, the impact
of climate policies on equity in per capita final energy use
would be much smaller than that of the future development
path.

"Integration between global climate policies and domestic air
pollution abatement policies could effectively reduce GHG
emissions in developing regions for the next two or three
decades; however, control of sulphur emissions could amplify
possible climate change, and partial trade-offs are likely to per-

"model that was used. The post-SRES scenarios cover a very
wide range of emission trajectories but the range is clearly
below the SRES range. All scenarios show an increase in CO,
reduction over time. Energy reduction shows a much wider
range than CO, reduction, because in many scenarios a decou-
pling between energy use and carbon emissions takes place as
aresult of a shift in primary energy sources.
"	Text
"In general, the lower the stabilization target and the higher the
level of baseline emissions, the larger the CO, divergence from
the baseline that is needed, and the earlier that it must occur.
The A1FI, A1B, and A2 worlds require a wider range and more
strongly implemented technology and/or policy measures than
AIT, B1, and B2. The 450 ppmv stabilization case requires
very rapid emission reduction over the next 20 to 30 years.
"	Text
"Policies governing agriculture and land use and energy systems
need to be linked for climate change mitigation. Supply of bio-
mass energy as well as biological CO, sequestration would
broaden the available options for carbon emission reductions,
although the post-SRES scenarios show that they cannot pro-
vide the bulk of the emission reductions required. That has to
come from other options.
"	Text
"No single measure will be sufficient for the timely develop-
ment, adoption, and diffusion of mitigation options to stabilize
atmospheric GHGs. Instead, a portfolio based on technological
change, economic incentives, and institutional frameworks
could be adopted. Combined use of a broad array of known
technological options has a long-term potential which, in com-
bination with associated socio-economic and_ institutional
changes, is sufficient to achieve stabilization of atmospheric
CO, concentrations in the range of 450-550ppmv or below.
"	Text
"An important policy question already mentioned concerns the
participation of developing countries in emission mitigation. A
preliminary finding of the post-SRES scenario analysis is that,
if it is assumed that the CO, emission reduction needed for sta-
bilization would occur in Annex I countries only, Annex I per
capita CO, emissions would fall below non-Annex I per capi-
ta emissions during the 21* century in nearly all of the stabi-
lization scenarios, and before 2050 in two-thirds of the scenar-
ios. This suggests that the stabilization target and the baseline
emission level are both important determinants of the timing
when developing countries’ emissions might need to diverge
from their baseline.
"	Text
"A key policy question is what kind of emission reductions in
the medium term (after the Kyoto protocol commitment peri-
od) would be needed. Analysis of the post-SRES scenarios
(most of which assume developing country emissions to be
below baselines by 2020) suggests that stabilization at
450ppmv will require emissions reductions in Annex I coun-
tries after 2012 that go significantly beyond their Kyoto
Protocol commitments. It also suggests that it would not be
necessary to go much beyond the Kyoto commitments for
Annex I countries by 2020 to achieve stabilization at 5SOppmv
or higher. However, it should be recognized that several sce-
narios indicate the need for significant Annex I emission reduc-
tions by 2020 and that none of the scenarios introduces other
constraints such as a limit to the rate of temperature change.
"	Text
"Assumed mitigation options differ among scenarios and are
strongly dependent on the model structure. However, common
features of mitigation scenarios include large and continuous
energy efficiency improvements and afforestation as well as
low-carbon energy, especially biomass, over the next one hun-
dred years and natural gas in the first half of the 21“ century.
Energy conservation and reforestation are reasonable first
steps, but innovative supply-side technologies will eventually
be required. Possible robust options include using natural gas
and combined-cycle technology to bridge the transition to
more advanced fossil fuel and zero-carbon technologies, such
as hydrogen fuel cells. Solar energy along with either nuclear
energy or carbon removal and storage would become increas-
ingly important for a higher emission world or lower stabiliza-
tion target.

"Another literature, consisting of more narrative-based scenar-
ios of alternative global futures, is also reviewed in this chap-
ter. These more general scenarios provide a basis for contextu-
alizing the more traditional emissions scenarios, and providing
a link to development, equity, and sustainability (DES).
"	Text
"In addition, in 1996, the IPCC commissioned a new report on
emissions scenarios (the Special Report on Emissions
Scenarios, or SRES), in which new scenarios were developed
(Nakicenovic et al., 2000). During 1999 and 2000 various
modellers used these new reference scenarios as the basis of
new mitigation and stabilization analyses. This post-SRES
work is also reviewed in this chapter.

"Many visions of the future can be modified into scenarios
through the systematization of data and other available informa-
tion, using various modelling techniques, and thereby leading to
quantitative interpretations of the future. The spectrum of sce-
narios can be as broad as that of visions, however, articulating a
scenario can provide a more detailed picture of the framework
for decisions and the associated limitations for decision-making
processes and policy interventions in any particular area.

"Various options for mitigating climate change, which consti-
tute the basis of this Working Group III report, depend on soci-
etal visions of the future. These visions largely define the deci-
sion analytical frameworks used (see Chapter 10) and form the
basis for evaluating options. As this chapter will make clear,
existing visions of the future are very different in scope and
scale, in time horizons, in constituents and uncertainties, and
cover different areas of human activities, natural conditions,
etc. Whereas some authors explore the future by extrapolating
trends, others aim at a more desirable future state.

"Climate change and its impacts have a long history in the exist-
ing scenario literature, while mitigation scenarios that explore
policy options to be implemented are of more recent origin. In
the Second Assessment Report (SAR) of the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), greenhouse gas (GHG) mit-
igation scenarios were reviewed. Since that time, there has
been considerable development of such scenarios, focussing on
issues of the timing, location, and extent of responses required
to stabilize atmospheric concentrations at various levels. These
new mitigation scenarios are reviewed in this chapter.

"Climate change assessment addresses a highly complex set of
interactions between human and natural systems, a scientific
challenge that is compounded by the cumulative and long-term
character of the phenomenon. While the world of many
decades from now is indeterminate, scenarios offer a structured
means of organizing information and gleaning insight into the
possibilities. Scenarios can draw on both science and imagina-
tion to articulate a spectrum of plausible visions of the future
and pathways of development. Some scenarios are assumed to
evolve gradually and continuously from current social, eco-
nomic, and environmental patterns and trends; others deviate
in fundamental ways. A long view of a multiplicity of future
possibilities is required to consider the ultimate risks of climate
change, assess critical interactions with other aspects of human
and environmental systems, and guide policy responses.

"A first wave of global assessments began in the 1970s.
Ambitious global modelling exercises aimed to forecast the
behaviour over many decades of development, resource, and
environmental systems, and to assess resource constraints
(Meadows et al., 1972; Mesarovic and Pestel, 1974). The Latin
American world model stressed social and political concerns,
rather than physical limits, by positing a normative egalitarian
future to examine the actions required to achieve it (Herrera et
al., 1976). A second wave of integrated global scenario analy-
ses responded to new concerns about sustainable development
and the future (WCED, 1987). Many of these were in the qual-
itative tradition (Svedin and Aniansson, 1987; Toth ef al.,
1989; Milbrath, 1989; Burrows ef al., 1991; Kaplan, 1994;
Gallopin et al., 1997; WBCSD, 1997; Bossel, 1998). In addi-
tion, stimulated largely by the climate issue, there have been a
number of new models that quantitatively link energy and
other human activities to atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial

"The term “scenarios” appears in two distinct streams of
inquiry, one based on qualitative narrative and the other on
mathematical models. Qualitative scenarios are primarily liter-
ary exercises, aimed at holistic and integrated sketches of
future visions and compelling accounts of a progression of
events that might lead to those futures. Quantitative, formal
models seek mathematical representation of key features of
human and/or environmental systems in order to represent the
evolution of the system under alternative assumptions, such as
population, economic growth, technological change, and envi-
ronmental sensitivity. Qualitative scenarios have a greater
power to posit system shifts, to explore the implications of sur-
prise, and to include critical factors that defy quantification,
such as values, cultural shifts, and institutional features. On the
other hand, qualitative scenarios may appear arbitrary, idiosyn-
cratic, and weakly supported. Model-based scenarios are use-
ful for examining futures that result from variations of quanti-
tative-driving variables, and they offer a systematic and replic-
able basis for analysis.

"In 1996, the IPCC initiated a process for establishing a new set
of reference emissions scenarios. The new scenarios are
described in the IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios
(Nakicenovic et al., 2000). These are designed to be non-miti-
gation or reference scenarios, that is, scenarios in which addi-
tional policy initiatives aimed specifically at lowering GHG
emissions are assumed to be absent.
"	Text
"Owing to fundamental uncertainties, it is impossible to predict
or forecast the long-range global future, even with the most
sophisticated methods. Long-range indeterminism implies that
probabilities cannot be rigorously assigned for either a given
set of driving assumptions or the likelihood of structural shifts
in societies and natural systems. Consequently, instead of a sin-
gle “business as usual” scenario, multiple baseline scenarios
are needed to scan a spectrum of plausible possibilities in order
to guide the formulation of robust policies that are not geared
to an overly rigid sense of where the world is heading.
"	Text
"To account for the wide variety of possible futures and the large
uncertainties involved in such forward projections, the SRES
team opted for a multiple baseline approach.” It also decided to
fuse a qualitative, narrative approach with a more formal
approach with different models, to guarantee structural variance
and methodological diversity in the scenarios. As such, the
SRES-scenarios combine elements from both the more story-like
scenarios discussed in Section 2.4 below, and the more model-
based scenarios discussed in Section 2.3. The relationship
between these three kinds of scenarios is shown in Figure 2.1.
"	Text
"IPCC GHG emission scenarios were prepared for the first
assessment report of 1990. These initial scenarios were updat-
ed and extended, and led to the publication in 1992 of alterna-
tive emissions scenarios for the period 1990 through 2100
(Leggett et al., 1992; Pepper et al., 1992). These so-called IS92
emission scenarios were used by the IPCC to assess changes in
atmospheric composition and climate over this time horizon.
Analysts have used the IS92 scenarios, and particularly IS92a,
as the preferred reference scenarios for mitigation and stabi-
lization studies. A subsequent IPCC evaluation of the IS92 sce-
narios (Alcamo et al., 1995) found that for the purposes of dri-
ving atmospheric and climate models, the carbon dioxide
(CO,) emissions trajectories of the IS92 scenarios provided a
reasonable reflection of variations found in the open literature.
However, the review found that these scenarios should not be
used for evaluating the consequences of interventions to reduce
GHG emissions since the scenarios have insufficient sectoral
and regional detail for careful analyses. This review also took
into account criticism by Parikh (1992) who suggested the
need for a more coherent approach and scenarios that show
improved equity between the developed and the developing
countries.

"3 Some climate polices have multiple benefits. For example, a partic-
ular policy designed to reduce methane leaks from natural gas systems
may also increase the operating company’s profitability and improve
safety. However, if this policy was originally developed to reduce
emissions it should be classified as a climate policy, not as a policy to
increase profitability or improve safety.

  
"	Text
"2 It is perhaps worth noting in this connection that, in a similar way,
the IPCC had originally recommended that climate and other mod-
ellers use the full set of IS92 scenarios but, in practice, this advice has
not been followed by most researchers who have focussed primarily
on the “central” IS92 case, thereby potentially contributing to an
unjustified sense of probability or accuracy.
"	Text
"CP scenarios are often, but not always, constructed with reference to a corresponding reference or baseline scenario that is similar to
the CP scenario in every respect except the inclusion of climate mitigation measures and/or policies. In fact, climate policy analysis
often starts with the construction of such a reference scenario, to which is added climate policy to create the CP scenario.
"	Text
"Recent discussions among IPCC experts and reactions from reviewers of this report and the SRES report revealed the need to clarify
differences between various types of GHG emission scenarios, in particular, between climate policy scenarios (CP scenarios) and sce-
narios without climate policies (NCP scenarios) but with low emissions.
"	Text
"CP scenarios (also known as climate intervention or climate mitigation scenarios) are defined in this report as those that: (1) include
explicit policies and/or measures, the primary? goal of which is to reduce GHG emissions (e.g., carbon tax) and/or (2) mention no cli-
mate policies and/or measures, but assume temporal changes in GHG emission sources or drivers required to achieve particular cli-
mate targets (e.g., GHG emission levels, GHG concentration levels, temperature increase or sea level rise limits).*+
"	Text
"Confusion can arise when the inclusion of “non-climate-related” policies in a NCP scenario has the effect of significantly reducing
GHG emissions. For example, energy efficiency or land use policies that reduce GHG emissions may be adopted for reasons that are
not related to climate policies and may therefore be included in a NCP scenario. Such a NCP scenario may have GHG emissions that
are lower than some CP scenarios.
"	Text
"The general definition of CP scenarios provided here enables one to effectively discriminate between CP scenarios and other scenar-
ios with low emissions (e.g., IS92c, SRES-B1). Unlike the former, NCP scenarios have low emissions but do not assume any explicit
emission abatement measures or policies, nor are they designed specifically to achieve certain climate targets. NCP scenarios by them-
selves may explore a wide variety of alternative development paths, including “green” or “dematerialization” futures.
"	Text
"Mitigation scenarios are usually defined as a description and a
quantified projection of how GHG emissions can be reduced
with respect to some baseline scenario. They contain new
emission profiles as well as costs associated with the emission
reduction. Stabilization scenarios are mitigation scenarios that
aim at a pre-specified GHG reduction target. Usually the target
is the concentration of CO, or the CO,-equivalent concentra-
tion of a “basket” of gases by 2100 or at some later date when
atmospheric stabilization is actually reached.
"	Text
"Another type of CP scenario is not originally built around such “no-policy” baselines. Developers of such scenarios envision future
“worlds” that are internally consistent with desirable climate targets (e.g., a global temperature increase of no more than 1°C by 2100),
and then work “backwards” to develop feasible emission trajectories and emission driver combinations leading to these targets. Such
scenarios, also referred to as “safe landing” or “tolerable windows” scenarios, imply the necessary development and implementation
of climate policies, intended to achieve these targets in the most efficient way.
"	Text
"There are two common difficulties associated with the formu-
lation and quantification of mitigation scenarios. First, in cer-
tain cases there is not a clear-cut distinction between interven-
tion and non-intervention scenarios, that is, scenarios with or
without explicit climate policy. This is discussed in detail in
Box 2.1. The second important problem regarding mitigation
scenarios has to do with the difference between top-down and
bottom-up models. Whereas the latter focus on engineering
trends and technology costs, the former view resource devel-
opment from a macroeconomic price-mediated perspective.

"The root cause of this potential confusion is that, in practice, many policies can both reduce GHG emissions and achieve other goals.
Whether such policies are assumed to be adopted for climate or non-climate policy related reasons in any given scenario is determined
by the scenario developer based on the underlying scenario narrative. While this is a problem in terms of making a clear distinction
between CP and NCP scenarios, it is at the same time an opportunity. Because many decisions are not made for reasons of climate
change alone, measures implemented for reasons other than climate change can have a large impact on GHG emissions, opening up
many new possibilities for mitigation. Chapters 7, 8, and 9 discuss ancillary benefits of climate mitigation and the co-benefits of poli-
cies integrating climate mitigation objectives with other goals.

"In this and other ways scenario analysis could become an
important way of linking DES issues to climate policy consid-

many quantitative mitigation and stabilization scenarios have

not always easy to draw out the DES implications of particular

Alternative assumptions on burden sharing have important
implications for equity, sustainable development, and the eco-
nomics of emissions abatement. However, it is noteworthy that
this critical conditioning variable is usually not explicitly treat-
ed in mitigation scenarios in the literature (see section 2.3
below). Indeed, documentation of scenarios generally does not
address the implications of the scenarios for equity and burden
sharing. In rare cases, mitigation scenarios have been devel-
oped which explicitly impose the simultaneous co-constraints
of climate and equity goals (e.g., Raskin et al., 1998).

"It is clear that climate policy, and the impacts of climate
change, will have significant implications for sustainable
development at both the global and sub-global levels. In addi-
tion, policy and behavioural responses to sustainable develop-
ment issues may affect both our ability to develop and suc-
cessfully implement climate policies, and our ability to
respond effectively to climate change. In this way, climate pol-
icy response will affect the ability of countries to achieve sus-
tainable development goals, while the pursuit of those goals
will in turn affect the opportunities for, and success of, climate
policy responses.
"	Text
"Although this chapter focuses on mitigation and stabilization
scenarios, it is important to note that DES issues are also
implicit in the base case or reference scenarios that underlie
mitigation and stabilization scenarios. Since the difference
between reference case scenarios and stabilization and mitiga-
tion scenarios is simply the addition of deliberate climate pol-
icy, it can be the case that the DES differences among different
reference case scenarios are greater than between any one such
scenario and its stabilization or mitigation version. This is of
particular relevance in the discussion below in section 2.5.2 of
scenarios based on the baselines produced in the IPCC’s SRES
(Nakicenovic et al., 2000).
"	Text
"The issues raised by a consideration of DES are of particular
relevance to the scenarios discussed in this chapter. Because
they are necessarily based upon assumptions about the socio-
economic conditions that give rise to emissions profiles, miti-
gation and stabilization scenarios implicitly or explicitly con-
tain information about DES. In principle, each stabilization or
mitigation scenario describes a particular future world, with
particular economic, social, and environmental characteristics.
Given the strong interactions between development, environ-
ment, and equity as aspects of a unified socio-ecological sys-
tem and the interplay between climate policies and DES poli-
cies, emissions scenarios are viewed in this report as an aspect
of broad sustainable development scenarios.

ios. This review focuses on mitigation scenarios that cover
global emissions and also have a time horizon encompassing
the coming century. Of the 150 mitigation scenarios, a total of
126 long-term scenarios that cover the next 50 to 100 years
were selected for this review. 24 scenarios were excluded on
the basis of their short time coverage.

"Other scenarios based on DICE (Nordhaus, 1994), MERGE

benefit maximization, which is estimated as the benefit pro-
duced by climatic policy minus the policy implementation
cost. In addition to the above, the low CO,-emitting energy
supply system (LESS) constructions should be noted. These
scenarios were developed on the basis of detailed assessments
of technological potentials, and can therefore be distinguished

"used as a benchmark for stabilization in the previous studies on
mitigation scenarios. This number may be related to the fre-
quent references made to it in political discussions. The adop-
tion by the European Union of a maximum increase in global
average temperature of 2°C above pre-industrial levels is
roughly equivalent to a stabilization level of S50ppmv CO,
equivalent or 450ppmv CO,. It does not imply an agreed-upon
desirability of stabilization at this level. In fact, environmental
groups have argued for desirable levels well below 550ppmy,
while other interest groups and some countries have questioned
the necessity and/or feasibility of achieving S50ppmv.
Scenarios with levels of concentration stabilization other than

"The emission stabilization scenarios account for 20 of the 126
mitigation scenarios. Most scenarios of this type are intended
to stabilize at 1990 emission levels in Annex I or the
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) countries. Some scenarios have emissions stabilizing
at other levels, for example, the emissions stabilization sce-
nario of DICE (Nordhaus, 1994) aims at a level of 8GtC/yr of
CO, and chlorinated fluorocarbons (CFCs) by 2100. Other sta-
bilization scenarios, namely the “Safe Emissions Corridor” or
“Tolerable Windows” (WBGU, 1995; Alcamo and Kreileman,
1996; Matsuoka er al., 1996) and “Climate Stabilization”
(Nordhaus, 1994) scenarios, determine the upper limit of emis-
sions based on a constraint of some natural threshold, such as
global mean temperature increase rate. Only a few studies are
based on such scenarios.

"Since most of the modelling exercises have been carried out to
study the CO, emissions from human activities linked to the
use of energy, energy supply and end-use are naturally the
areas where policy is applied. Energy supply options include
natural gas, renewable energy, and commercial biomass; intro-

"The LESS constructions described in the IPCC’s SAR, Working Group II (IPCC, 1996, Ch19), were probably the only constructions
akin to mitigation “scenarios” taken up in SAR. They are similar to the mitigation scenarios reviewed in this chapter in that they also
explore alternative paths to energy futures in order to achieve mitigation of carbon dioxide.
"	Text
"Both bottom-up and top-down approaches were used in the LESS constructions. For the reference cases in the bottom-up analyses,
the energy demand projections for the high economic growth variant of the “Accelerated Policies” scenarios developed by the
Response Strategies Working Group (RSWG, 1990) were adopted.
"	Text
"A top-down exercise was carried out to test the robustness of the bottom-up energy supply analyses by incorporating performance and
cost parameters for some of the key technologies in the BI variant. Six technology cases were modelled using the Edmonds-Reilly—Barns
(ERB) model. The results for CO, emissions in two cases (cases 5 and 6) were comparable to the bottom-up LESS variants, but the ener-
gy end-uses were different owing to different assumptions.

"oxide (N,O) (e.g., EPA, 1990; IPCC, 1990; Manne er al.,
1995; Tol, 1997), and a few go even further to include sul-
phates, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and halocarbons
(e.g. IPCC, 1992; WEC, 1995; Edmonds et al., 1996, 1997).
With respect to the policy options used in the scenario quan-
tifications, three fields are taken into account in the reviewed
studies: energy systems (including both supply and demand),
industrial processes (including cement and metal production),
and land use (including agriculture and forest management).
"	Text
"The central finding of the LESS construction exercise is that deep reductions of CO, emissions from the energy sector are technical-
ly possible within 50 to 100 years, using alternative strategies. Global CO, emissions could be reduced from about 6GtC in 1990 to
about 2GtC in 2100, in many combinations of the options analyzed. Cumulative CO, emissions, from 1990 to 2100, would range from
about 450 to about 470GtC in the alternative LESS constructions. Higher energy efficiency is underscored in order to achieve deep
reductions in CO, emissions, increase the flexibility of supply-side combinations, and reduce overall energy system costs.
"	Text
"A number of technologies with potential for reducing CO, emissions exist or are in a state of possible commercialization. The LESS
constructions illustrate the potential for reducing emissions by using energy more efficiently and by using various combinations of
low CO,-emitting energy supply technologies, including shifts to low-carbon fossil fuels, shifts to renewable and nuclear energy
sources, and decarbonization of fuels. The assumed technological feasibility and costs of each of the technologies included in these
variants is based on an extensive literature review.
"	Text
"The policy instruments analyzed depend on the underlying
model structure. Most of the scenarios introduce policies such
as simple carbon taxes or a constraint on emissions or concen-
tration levels for achieving the desired reduction or stabiliza-
tion. How the constraint is imposed varies from scenario to
scenario. Among the models with regional disaggregation, a
few regional targets have been introduced (e.g., Nordhaus,
1994; Tol, 1999). Regional disaggregation also allows mod-
ellers to let the regions trade in emission permits. Permit trad-
ing is introduced in more recent work, especially just before
and after the Third Conference of the Parties to the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Kyoto
(December 1997). Some studies offer permit trading as a

"The five variants constructed in the bottom-up analyses were (1) BI: biomass intensive, (2) NI: nuclear intensive, (3) NGI: natural gas
intensive, (4) CI: coal intensive, and (5) HD: high demand. The BI variant explores the potential for using renewable electricity
sources in power generation. Both intermittent renewables (wind, photovoltaics, and solar thermal-electricity technologies) and
advanced biomass electricity-generating technologies (biomass-integrated gasifier and/or gas turbine technologies through 2025 and
biomass-integrated gasifier and/or fuel-cell technologies through 2050 and beyond) were applied. The NI variant involves a revital-
ization of the nuclear energy option and deployment of nuclear electric power technology worldwide. In the NGI variant, the empha-
sis is on natural gas. Any natural gas in excess of that for the reference cases is used to make methanol (CH,O) and hydrogen (H,).
These displace CH,O and H, produced from plantation biomass. In the CI variant, the strategy for achieving deep reductions involves
using coal and biomass for CH,O and H, production, along with sequestration of the CO, separated out at synthetic fuel production
facilities. Finally, in the HD variant the excess demand is met by providing an extra supply of fuels with low emissions. To illustrate
the possibilities, the HD variant is constructed with all of the incremental electricity provided by intermittent renewables.

the work done in the early 1990s led to the development of
detailed scenarios for introducing such policies (EPA, 1990;

side technology introduction (Nakicenovic et al., 1993;
Edmonds et al., 1996; Fujii and Yamaji, 1998), while other
models emphasize the introduction of efficient demand-side

"In order to analyze the characteristics of stabilization scenarios,
it is very important to identify the features of the baseline sce-
narios that have been used for mitigation quantification.
Although the general characteristics of non-intervention scenar-
ios have already been analyzed in the SRES (Nakicenovic et al.,
2000), more specific analyses are conducted here, focusing on
the baseline scenarios that have been used for 550ppmv stabi-
lization quantification.

"The issue of burden sharing among regions is a contentious one
and it was sparsely treated in the first half of the 1990s. Most
discussions about burden sharing are of a qualitative and par-
tial nature and are not related to model-based mitigation sce-
narios. A few studies (most notably Rose and Stevens, 1993;
Enquete Commission, 1995; and Manne and Richels, 1997)
present a set of burden-sharing rules in their scenarios. Of late,
the EMF exercises looking at the Kyoto scenarios have treated
this issue better than in the past (Weyant, 1999).
"	Text
"First, it is clear that the range of CO, emissions in baseline sce-
narios used for 550ppmv stabilization quantification is very wide
at the global level, as shown in Figure 2.2. The maximum levels
of CO, emissions represent more than ten times the current lev-
els, while the minimum level represents four times current levels.
The range of baseline scenarios covers the upper half of the total
range of the database, and most of them were estimated to be
larger than IS92a (IPCC 1992 scenario “‘a”). This means that the
baseline scenarios used for the 550ppmv stabilization analyses
have a very wide range and are high relative to other studies.
"	Text
"From the large number of mitigation scenarios, a selection must
be made in order to clarify in a manageable way the quantitative
characteristics of mitigation scenarios. One of the efficient ways
to analyze them is to focus on a typical mitigation target. As the
most frequently studied mitigation target is the 5SOppmv stabi-
lization scenario, a total of 31 stabilization scenarios adopting
that target were selected along with their baseline (reference or
non-intervention) scenarios in order to analyze the characteris-
tics of the stabilization scenarios as well as their baselines>.
Figure 2.2 shows these baseline scenarios, and Figure 2.3 shows
the mitigation scenarios for 550ppmv stabilization. (The sources
and scenario names are noted in Appendix 2.1).

"Technological improvement is a critical element in all the gen-
eral mitigation scenarios. This is apparent when the detailed pol-
icy options are studied, where such literature is available. For
instance, Nakicenovic ef al. (1993) (using MESSAGE) incorpo-
rated policies of dematerialization and recycling, efficiency
improvements and industrial process changes, and fuel-mix
changes in the industrial sector; fuel efficiency improvements,
modal split changes, behavioural change, and technological
change in the transport sector; and efficiency improvements of
end-use conversion technologies, fuel-mix changes, and
demand-side measures in the household and services sector. It
should be noted that efficiency improvement through techno-
logical advancement is emphasized in all sectors. Similar poli-
cies leading to efficiency improvement were also underlined in

"The time-paths of emission reduction are determined in three
ways in the reviewed studies. First, the emission trajectories
are determined by policy scenarios that have been designed in
detail for regions over the time frame (EPA, 1990; IPCC, 1990;
WEC, 1995; Edmonds er al., 1996; Yohe and Wallace, 1996;
Kainuma et al., 1998). Second, dynamic optimization models
automatically determine these reduction time-paths by global
cost minimization over time (e.g., Peck and Tiesberg, 1995;
Fujii and Yamaji, 1998) or economic welfare maximization
(Nordhaus, 1994; Manne er al., 1995). Third, mitigation sce-
narios of tolerable windows/safe landing, or safe emission cor-
ridors, can fix the time series of emission reduction by intro-
ducing a specific constraint of the rate of change in natural sys-
tems including the global temperature change rate (e.g.,
Alcamo and Kreileman, 1996).

"countries, GDP growth is the most significant factor, resulting
in high levels of energy use and CO, emissions; energy effi-

tic energy mix changes.

"With regard to regional comparisons, it is very difficult to
come to any general conclusions, as the ranges involved in the
regional scenarios are extraordinarily large. Moreover, with the
exception of the USA, Europe, the Former Soviet Union (FSU)
and China, the number of available scenarios is limited.
However, some general trends can be identified that are asso-
ciated with the medium ranges of the scenarios: for Asian

"Other interesting characteristics at the global level can be iden-
tified in the relationships among GDP, energy intensity, and
carbon intensity. Figure 2.5 shows a scatter plot of GDP
growth rate versus energy intensity reduction from the baseline
scenarios. As might be expected, the energy intensity reduction
is higher with a higher GDP growth rate, while a lower energy
intensity reduction is associated with a lower GDP growth rate.
This relationship suggests that high economic growth scenar-
ios assume high levels of progress in end-use technologies.
"	Text
"These characteristics are also observed in regional scenarios.
For example, in both the OECD and non-OECD scenarios,
CO,, GDP, energy intensity, and carbon intensity have wide
ranges, and in particular, the range among scenarios for the
non-OECD nations is wider than the range among scenarios for
OECD nations. In addition, the growth of CO, emissions in
non-OECD nations is generally larger than the growth of emis-
sions in OECD nations. This is mainly caused by higher GDP
growth in the non-OECD countries.
"	Text
"Figure 2.4 shows these factors. For comparability of the factors,
which were not harmonized to be the same number among mod-
els in the base year of 1990, all the values are indexed to 1990
levels. CO, emissions are mostly determined by energy con-
sumption. This, in turn, is determined by the levels of GDP,
energy intensity, and carbon intensity. However, the ranges of
GDP and of carbon intensities in the scenarios are larger than the
range of energy intensities. This suggests that the large range of
CO, emissions in the scenarios is primarily a reflection of the
large ranges of GDP and carbon intensity in the scenarios. Thus,
the assumptions made about economic growth and energy sup-
ply result in huge variations in CO, emission projections.
"	Text
"Unlike energy intensity reductions, carbon intensity reductions
in the models are apparently seen as largely independent of
economic growth and consequently are a function of societal
choices, including energy and environmental policies. The sce-
narios do not show any clear relationship between energy
intensity reduction and carbon intensity reduction. The values
depend on regional characteristics in energy systems and tech-
nology combinations. Energy intensity reduction can include
many measures other than fuel shifting. Most of the efficiency
measures will result in lower carbon emissions, and fuel shifts
from high-carbon to low- or non-carbon fuels can increase the
efficiency of energy systems in many cases. However, carbon
intensity reductions can also lead to reduced efficiency in ener-
gy systems, as in the case of shifts to biomass gasification or
liquefaction, or result in increased energy consumption, as in
the case of industrial carbon sequestration.

global and the non-OECD levels, respectively, which were
estimated for each scenario source by subtracting stabilization
scenario emissions (Figure 2.3) from baseline scenario emis-
sions (Figure 2.2). These figures show that the range of
reduced CO, emissions for 550ppmy stabilization is also very
wide both at the global and the non-OECD levels. This wide
range is apparently caused by the divergent baseline scenarios
shown in Figure 2.2, while other factors such as differences in
emission time-path, in timing of stabilization and in the carbon
cycle model used also tend to increase the range.

"The divergence in reduction time-path has been discussed
based on two sets of popular scenarios. One is a set of IPCC
Working Group (WG) I scenarios (Houghton ef al., 1996)
which is sometimes referred to as “early action scenarios” and
denoted as “WGI”; the other is a set of scenarios published by
Wigley et al. (1996), sometimes referred to as “delayed action
scenarios” and denoted ““WRE”. Chapter 8 explains that these
terms are misleading, since WRE scenarios may not assume
early emissions reductions, but do assume early actions to
facilitate such reductions later. Figure 2.3 compares the 550
ppmv stabilization scenarios of these two scenario sets with the
reviewed scenarios, and it shows that scenarios reviewed here
cover a wider range than that of the WGI and WRE scenarios.
While the RICE and MERGE scenarios show late reduction
(WRE type) trajectories, the CETA, MARIA and MIT scenar-
ios show more severe reduction (WGI type) trajectories.” A
few scenarios, for example ICAM2, show no drastic reduction
even in the latter half of the 21st century. Most of the scenar-
ios have emissions trajectories that lie in between.
"	Text
"The regional allocation of reductions is a controversial and
highly political issue from the equity viewpoint. Mostly, mod-
ellers do not explicitly state the burden-sharing rule.
Nevertheless, the emission reduction from baseline by the non-
Annex I countries is a good indicator of when it is assumed that
these countries start sharing the reductions. The data set used
in this analysis is limited in the sense that models have differ-
ent regional specifications; it was therefore difficult to obtain a
large number of data points to analyze non-Annex | emissions.
As a proxy, emission reduction from the baseline by the non-
OECD region is used, which includes Russia and Eastern
Europe. This is shown in Figure 2.7. In part of the AIM,
MiniCAM, FUND, and PEF scenarios, introduction of climate
policy in the non-OECD region is assumed not to begin by
2010. Although Russia and Eastern European countries are
included in the Kyoto Protocol, the models do assume that
because of the decreased emissions in these countries since
1990, actual climate policies would not be needed until 2010.
Some scenarios show that non-OECD regions may not have to
significantly reduce emissions before 2030. However, there are
still other scenarios that show an opposite picture. The RICE,
MERGE, MIT, and MARIA scenarios show a very steep
increase in emission reduction from baseline levels in the non-
OECD region starting very early in the 21 century.

per year within the sampled data, while the additional reduc-
tion in carbon intensity from the baseline is between zero and
3.76% per year. Although it is difficult to identify detailed pol-
icy assumptions from the database, the range of these factors
suggests divergent policy options among scenarios. These pol-
icy options are dependent not only on the level of CO, reduc-

"Figure 2.8 (b) shows the relationship between the effects of
decarbonization policies and the carbon intensity reductions
assumed in the baseline scenarios. This figure suggests that
baseline scenarios with high carbon intensity reductions show
larger carbon intensity reductions in their mitigation scenarios,
while those with low carbon intensity reductions in the base
case show smaller reductions in carbon intensity in their corre-
sponding stabilization cases. This is somewhat counterintuitive
and difficult to explain simply on the basis of the results avail-
able. One might expect that high carbon intensity reductions in
the base case might “use up” decarbonization potential, giving
rise to lower additional reduction of carbon intensity in mitiga-
tion scenarios. On the other hand, increased investment in low-
carbon energy technology in the base case could increase the
resource base of low-carbon energy, thereby providing more
opportunity to reduce CO, emissions in the stabilization case.
The mitigation potential in this direction depends not only on
the technology but also, and perhaps more, on the economics
and social acceptance of the technology. A closer and more
careful analysis of which particular mitigation policies were
assumed in constructing the scenario than was possible on the
basis of the available information, would reveal the underlying
reasons for such a pattern.

scenarios that consider developed nations. There is little con-
sensus with respect to future directions among the existing dis-
aggregated scenarios in developing regions.
"	Text
"Some general conclusions about the relationships between
baseline scenarios and mitigation policies are suggested by this
review: an assumption of high economic growth in the baseline
tends to be associated with more technological progress; the
additional improvement of energy efficiency in mitigation sce-
narios tends to be lower when the energy efficiency improve-
ment is high in the base case; and baseline scenarios with high
carbon intensity reductions lead to mitigation scenarios with
relatively more carbon intensity reduction. The counterintu-
itive nature of some of these conclusions suggests that the rela-
tionship between economic growth and the macroeconomic
cost of emission reduction is very complicated.
"	Text
"In another type of scenario analysis, Alcamo and Kreileman (1996) used the IMAGE 2 model to evaluate the environmental conse-
quences of a large set of non-CO, and CO, mitigation scenarios. They concluded that non-CO, emissions would have to be controlled
along with CO, emissions in order to slow the increase of atmospheric temperature to below prescribed levels. Hayhoe ef al. (1999)
pointed out two additional benefits of mitigating CH,, an important non-CO, gas. First, most CH, reduction measures do not require
the turnover of capital stock (as do CO, measures), and can therefore be carried out more rapidly than CO, reduction measures. Second,
CH, reductions will have a more immediate impact on mitigating climate change than CO, reductions because the atmosphere
responds more rapidly to changes in CH, than to CO, concentrations.

"increase in the second half of the 21‘ century. The GDP loss
may or may not be related to the GDP growth assumptions in
baselines. For instance, high baseline economic growth would
lead to higher emissions of GHGs, which would lead to
increased GHG reduction costs compared to the corresponding
mitigation scenario for a low-growth baseline. On the other
hand, high economic growth could provide increased funds for
research and development (R&D) of advanced technologies,
which would decrease the cost of GHG reduction. The net cost
would depend on the relative strengths of these effects.
Another aspect is that the costs are also dependent upon the
structure of economies, i.e., economies with high fossil fuel
dependence, via either exports or domestic consumption, are
likely to experience higher costs compared with economies
with relatively lower fossil fuel dependence.
"	Text
"Since the publication of IPCC’s SAR, the literature on mitigation scenarios has continued to focus on the reduction of CO, emissions
rather than on other GHGs. This is unfortunate because non-CO, emissions make up a significant fraction of the total “basket of gases”
that must be reduced under the Kyoto Protocol. However, a small set of papers has reported on scenarios for mitigating non-CO, gases,
especially CH, and N,O. In one such paper, Reilly er al. (1999) compared scenarios for achieving emission reductions with and with-
out non-CO, emissions in Annex B countries (those countries that are included in emission controls under the Kyoto Protocol).
Scenarios that omitted measures for reducing non-CO, gases had 21% higher annual costs in 2010 than those that included them.
Tuhkanen et al. (1999) and Lehtila er al. (1999) came to similar conclusions — in a scenario analysis for 2010, they found that includ-
ing CH, and N,O in mitigation strategies for Finland reduced annual costs by 20% in the year 2010 relative to a baseline scenario. The
general conclusion of these papers is that small reductions of GHG emissions, for example of the magnitude required by the Kyoto
Protocol, can be accomplished at a lower cost by taking into account measures to reduce non-CO, gases, and that a small reduction of
non-CO, gases can produce large impacts at low cost because of the high global warming potential (GWP) of these gases.

emission scenario assessments, because they consider several
dimensions that elude quantification, such as governance,
social structures, and institutions, but which are nonetheless
important to the success of mitigation (and adaptation) policies

from diverse regional perspectives, rather than a single study. The GSG scenarios are holistic, developed both as narratives — accounts
of how human values, cultural choices, and institutional arrangements might unfold — and detailed quantitative representations of
social conditions such as level of poverty, economic patterns, and a wide range of environmental issues.

set of scenarios, with both increasing and decreasing GHG
emissions. In the latter case, mediating factors include
increased energy efficiency, shifts to non-fossil energy sources,
and/or shifts to a post-industrial (service-based) economy.
Similarly, population growth is present in scenarios with rising
emissions as well as scenarios with falling emissions, although
in the latter group of scenarios, population tends to stabilize at
relatively low levels, in many cases owing to increased pros-
perity, expanded provision of family planning, and improved

"“Conventional Worlds” is where much of the policy discussion occurs, including most of the analysis of climate mitigation. The inte-
grated GSG approach situates the discussion of alternative emission scenarios in the context of sustainable development, by making
poverty reduction an explicit scenario driver, and highlighting the links between climate and other environment and resource issues
(Raskin et al., 1998). The regional distribution of emissions becomes an explicit consideration in scenario design that is linked to
poverty reduction, equity, and burden sharing in environmentally-sound global development. By underscoring the interactions between
environmental and social goals, the policy strategies for addressing climate are assessed for compatibility and synergy with a wider
family of actions for fostering sustainable development.

"The GSG framework includes three broad classes of scenarios for scanning the future — “Conventional Worlds”, “Barbarization”, and
“Great Transitions” — with variants within each class. All are compatible with current patterns and trends, but have very different
implications for society and the environment in the 21st century (Gallopin et al., 1997). In “Conventional Worlds” scenarios, global
society develops gradually from current patterns and dominant tendencies, with development driven primarily by rapidly growing mar-
kets as developing countries converge towards the development model of advanced industrial (“developed”) countries. In
“Barbarization” scenarios, environmental and social tensions spawned by conventional development are not resolved, humanitarian
norms weaken, and the world becomes more authoritarian or more anarchic. “Great Transitions” explore visionary solutions to the sus-
tainability challenge, which portray the ascendancy of new values, lifestyles, and institutions.

of insights that are relevant to GHG emission scenarios and
sustainable development. First, a wide range of future condi-

"The major visible difference has to do with environmental
impacts. As might be expected, pollution and the risk of eco-
logical collapse are generally high in scenarios which show ris-
ing GHG emissions, and low in scenarios which show falling
GHG emissions. Water availability and biodiversity decline in
the scenarios with rising GHG emissions, and rise or stay the
same in the scenarios with falling GHG emissions.
"	Text
"Chapter 3 of the SRES discusses the relationships between
GHG emissions and a number of driving forces, including pop-
ulation, economic and social development (including equity),
and technology. What is clear from that discussion, which is
consistent with the evidence summarized in Table 2.4, is that
the impacts on GHG emissions of changes in these underlying
driving forces are complex.
"	Text
"environmental systems. Since future values of the underlying
socio-economic drivers of emissions may vary widely, it is
important that GHG emission scenarios in particular, and cli-
mate change analysis in general, not limit themselves to a nar-
row range of possible futures, but consider the implications for
mitigation of quite different sets of future conditions. In turn,
climate policies should be designed so that they are resilient
against widely different future conditions.
"	Text
"On a different front, in the scenarios with rising GHG emis-
sions, conflict and security activity are generally high, while
government intervention in the economy and income equality
(within nations) are generally low. The reverse is true in the
scenarios with falling GHG emissions, which also show
improving equity between North and South. This would be
expected from the fact that all but one of these scenarios are
Sustainable Development scenarios.
"	Text
"These complex relationships suggest that the choice of future
“world” is more fundamental than the choice of a few driving
forces in determining GHG emissions. The wide range of emis-
sions in the various SRES baseline scenarios also demonstrates
this point. Choices about DES are crucial, not just for the
underlying conditions which give rise to emissions, but also for
the nature and severity of climate change impacts, and the suc-
cess of particular mitigation and adaptation policies. This find-
ing is consistent with the discussion in Chapter 1, which sug-
gests the central importance of DES issues in any consideration
of climate change.
"	Text
"In general, the global futures scenarios provide more compre-
hensive coverage of the issues relevant to sustainable develop-
ment than the general mitigation scenarios described in section
2.3. They therefore represent an important complement to the
quantitative emission scenarios. However, there are significant
difficulties involved in trying to connect the mainly narrative-
based scenarios discussed in this section with the more quanti-
tatively oriented scenarios discussed earlier. In this connection,
the work of the Global Scenarios Group, the SRES, and others

and economic elements of sustainable development with model
"	Text
"It is important therefore that emission scenarios consider qual-
itative aspects that are potentially important for future GHG
emissions and mitigation policies. One way to do this is to link
these scenarios with the broader global futures scenarios.
However, this will be difficult because there are few areas of
overlap, as a result of the very different natures of the two
kinds of scenarios. Perhaps a more fruitful way of incorporat-
ing qualitative dimensions into quantitative scenarios, already
pursued by the Global Scenarios Group and others, as well as
in the SRES, is to develop quantitative estimates of key vari-
ables based on qualitative descriptions of future worlds.
"	Text
"Third, scenarios do not all show a positive relationship
between emissions and economic and population growth, as is
commonly assumed (see also the discussion of the Kaya iden-
tity in Section 2.3.2.1 of this chapter). This is largely because,
in the scenarios with declining emissions and rising population
and economic activity, policy, lifestyle choices, and technolog-
ical development act to reduce emissions through efficiency
improvements, energy conservation, shifts to alternative fuels,
and shifts to post-industrial economic structures. This suggests
that different combinations of driving forces are consistent
with low emission scenarios, which agrees with the SRES find-
ings. The implication of this would seem to be that it is impor-
tant to consider the linkage between climate policy and other
policies and conditions associated with the choice of future
paths in a general sense. In other words, low emission futures
are associated with a whole set of policies and actions that go
beyond the development of climate policy itself.
"	Text
"Second, the global futures scenarios describe a wide range of
worlds, from pessimistic to optimistic, that are consistent with
rising GHG emissions and a smaller range of (generally opti-
mistic) worlds that are consistent with falling emissions.
Scenarios that show falling emissions tend to show improved
governance, increased equity and political participation,
reduced conflict, conditions supportive of lower birth rates,
and improved environmental quality. Scenarios with rising
emissions generally show reduced environmental quality and
equity within nations and increased conflict, and are more
mixed with respect to governance and international equity.
Both types of scenarios generally indicate continued techno-
logical development. The Sustainable Development scenarios
suggest that sustainable development approaches are feasible,
and can lead to futures characterized by relatively low emis-
sions. A key implication is that sustainable development poli-
cies, taken generally, can make a significant contribution to
emission reduction.

The SRES writing team developed four scenario “families”
(see Box 2.5 for an explanation of terminology used in the
SRES), because an even number helps to avoid the impression
that there is a “central” or “most likely” case. The scenarios
cover a wide range — but not all possible futures. In particular,
there are no “global disaster” scenarios. None of the scenarios
include new explicit climate policies.

"Each family has a unifying theme in the form of a “storyline”
or narrative that describes future demographic, social, eco-
nomic, technological, and policy trends. Four storylines were
developed by the whole writing team that identified driving
forces, key uncertainties, possible scenario families, and their
logic. Six global modelling teams then quantified the story-
lines. The quantification consisted of first translating the story-
lines into a set of quantitative assumptions about the driving
forces of emissions (for example, rates of change of population
and size of the economy and rates of technological change).
Next, these assumptions were input to six integrated, global
models that computed the emissions of GHGs and sulphur
dioxide (SO,). As a result, a total of 40 scenarios were pro-
duced for the four storylines. The large number of alternative
scenarios showed that a single storyline could lead to a large
number of feasible emission pathways.

"A key feature of the SRES process was that different method-
ological approaches and models were used to develop the sce-
narios. Another was that an “open process” was used to devel-
op the scenarios through which researchers and other interest
groups throughout the world could review and comment on the
SRES scenarios as they were being developed. The SRES also
aimed at improving the process of scenario development by
extensively documenting the inputs and assumptions of the
SRES scenarios; by formulating narrative scenario storylines;
by encouraging a diversity of approaches and methods for
deriving scenarios; by making the scenarios from different
groups more comparable, and by assessing their differences
and similarities; by expanding the range of economic-develop-
ment pathways, including a narrowing of the income gap
between developing and industrially developed countries; by
incorporating the latest information on economic restructuring
throughout the world; and by examining different trends in and
rates of technological change.

sions for the six illustrative SRES scenarios is generally some-
what lower than the range of the IPCC IS92 scenarios (Leggett

scenarios increases the covered emissions range. Jointly, the
SRES scenarios cover the relevant range of global emissions,
from the 95th percentile at the high end of the distribution all
the way down to very low emissions just above the 5th per-
centile of the distribution. Thus, they only exclude the most
extreme emissions scenarios found in the literature — those sit-

important is that each of the four scenario families covers a siz-
able part of this distribution, implying that a similar quantifi-
cation of driving forces can lead to a wide range of future emis-
sions. More specifically, a given combination of the main dri-
ving forces is not sufficient to uniquely determine a future
emission path. There are too many uncertainties. The fact that
each of the scenario families covers a substantial part of the lit-

need to analyze and compare mitigation scenarios using as
their baselines the new IPCC scenarios, which quantify a wide
range of future worlds. Consequently, they participated (on a
voluntary basis) in a special comparison programme to quanti-
fy SRES-based mitigation scenarios (Morita et al., 2000a;
2000b). These SRES-based scenarios are called “Post-SRES
Mitigation Scenarios”.

"An important feature of the SRES scenarios obtained using the
SAR methodology is that their overall radiative forcing is high-
er than the IS92 range despite comparatively lower GHG emis-
sions (Wigley and Raper, 1992; Wigley er al., 1994; Houghton
et al., 1996; Wigley, 1999; Smith et al., 2000; IPCC, 2001).
This results from the loss of sulphur-induced cooling during
the second half of the 21st century. On one hand, the reduction
in global sulphur emissions reduces the role of sulphate
aerosols in determining future climate, and therefore reduces
one aspect of uncertainty about future climate change (because
the precise forcing effect of sulphate aerosols is highly uncer-
tain). On the other hand, uncertainty increases because of the
diversity in spatial patterns of SO, emissions in the scenarios.
Future assessments of possible climate change need to account
for these different spatial and temporal dynamics of GHG and
sulphur emissions, and they need to cover the whole range of
radiative forcing associated with the scenarios.

"a particular scenario description. This particularly
applies to the A2 and B2 scenarios that imply a variety
of regional development patterns that are wider than in
the Al and B1 scenarios. The numerical precision of
any model result should not distract from the basic fact
that uncertainty abounds. However, in the opinion of
the SRES writing team, the multi-model approach
increases the value of the SRES scenario set, since
uncertainties in the choice of model input assumptions
can be more explicitly separated from the specific
model behaviour and related modelling uncertainties.
Any scenario has subjective elements and is open to
various interpretations. While the SRES writing team
as a whole has no preference for any of the scenarios,
and has no judgement about the probability or desir-
ability of the scenarios, the open process and reactions
to SRES scenarios have shown that individuals and
interest groups do have such judgements. This will
stimulate an open discussion in the political arena about
potential futures and choices that can be made in the
context of climate change response. For the scientific
community, the SRES scenario exercise has led to the
identification of a number of recommendations for
future research that can further increase understanding
about potential development of socio-economic driving
forces and their interactions, and associated GHG emis-
sions.

Alternative combinations of driving-force variables can
lead to similar levels and structure of energy use and
land-use patterns, as illustrated by the various scenario
groups and scenarios. Hence, even for a given scenario
outcome, for example, in terms of GHG emissions,
there are alternative combinations and alternative path-
ways that could lead to that outcome. For instance, sig-
nificant global changes could result from a scenario of
high population growth, even if per capita incomes
would rise only modestly, as well as from a scenario in
which a rapid demographic transition (low population
levels) coincides with high rates of income growth and
affluence.

Important possibilities for further bifurcations in future
development trends exist within one scenario family,
even when adopting certain values for important sce-
nario driving force variables to illustrate a particular
possible development path.

Emissions profiles are dynamic across the range of
SRES scenarios. They portray trend reversals and indi-
cate possible emissions crossover among different sce-
narios. They do not represent mere extensions of a con-
tinuous increase of GHGs and sulphur emissions into
the future. This more complex pattern of future emis-
sions across the range of SRES scenarios reflects the
recent scenario literature.

Describing potential future developments involves
inherent ambiguities and uncertainties. One and only
one possible development path (as alluded to for
instance in concepts such as “business-as-usual sce-
nario”) simply does not exist. And even for each alter-
native development path described by any given sce-
nario, there are numerous combinations of driving
forces and numerical values that can be consistent with

"Developing and implementing climate change mitigation mea-
sures and policies in the A2 world can be quite complicated.
This is a result of several features embedded in the scenario
storyline: rapid population growth, relatively slow GDP per
capita growth, slow technological progress, and a regional and
partially “isolationist” approach in national and international
politics. Because of all these serious challenges, the abatement
of GHG emissions in the A2 world becomes plausible only in
the situation when the negative effects of climate change
become imminent and the associated losses “outweigh” the
costs of mitigation. The same features that make the A2 world
“non-receptive” to worldwide mitigation policies may exacer-
bate the climate change effects and prompt nations to act.
Measures such as a rapid shift towards high-tech renewable
energy or deep-sea carbon storage will be highly improbable in
the A2 world as a consequence of technology limitations.
Instead, such relatively low-tech measures as limiting energy
consumption, and capturing and using methane from natural
gas systems, coal mining, and landfills better fit the A2 world’s
economic and technological profile. The lack of global co-
operation may cause rather large regional variations in the fea-

Comparing the CO, emissions reductions from SRES
baselines, the models have many points in common, but
there are also some clear differences. All models show
an increase in CO, reduction over time. This reflects
the strong constraint of atmospheric CO, concentration.
There is a considerable range in reductions among
models in early years. However, most models achieve a
similar proportional reduction from the baseline over
the observation period.

For achieving stabilization at SSOppmv, the highest
reductions in CO, emissions compared to the baseline
are observed in the A2 family. BI shows the lowest
reductions. CO, reduction at the end of the 21 century
ranges in A2 between 75% and 80%, A1B between
50% and 75%, B2 between 40% and 70%, and B1
between 5% and 40%.

by subtracting baseline emissions from mitigation scenario
emissions. In general, the lower the stabilization level that is
required, as well as the higher the level of baseline emissions
caused by the selected development path, the larger the CO,
divergence from the baseline that is needed in all the regions.
However, it does not simply follow from the larger divergence
in emissions that there is an earlier divergence from the base-
line.

"A key policy question is what kind of emission reductions
would be needed in the medium term, after the commitment
period of the Kyoto Protocol (assuming that it will be imple-
mented). Figure 2.16 shows the percent reduction in energy-
related CO, emissions in Annex I countries from 1990 for the
various stabilization cases. Since the first commitment period
of the Kyoto Protocol ends in 2012, this can give some indica-
tion of the extent to which emission reduction commitments
after 2012 would be needed to achieve the various stabilization
levels. It should be noted that about two thirds of the scenarios
assume that developing countries have already diverged from
their baseline emission trajectories in 2020. Another point is
that the post-SRES scenarios were not developed specifically
to include the Kyoto targets, so there is a range of Annex |
emission reductions (from 1990 levels) in 2010, 2020 and
2030. The mid-course scenarios are indicated in Figure 2.16 as

"The target stabilization level also significantly affects
the CO, reduction, even when based on the same base-
line scenario. In the 450ppmv stabilization case, the
reduction reaches 70% to 100%'4 of A1B baseline
emissions at the end of the 21"" century.

Energy consumption reductions are more complicated
among models. There is no strong relationship between
the level of energy consumption and the stabilization
level.

Different baselines lead to different macroeconomic
costs in order to reach a stabilization target. In spite of
the wide range among models, A2 would be the most
expensive case while B1 would require the lowest cost
for stabilization at 550ppmv. The GDP loss in Bl
would be less than one-tenth that in the A1B case, and
less than one-twentieth that in the A2 case.

The CO, reduction and macroeconomic costs are also
significantly affected by the target stabilization level,
even when based on the same baseline scenario. The
economic cost for 450ppmv stabilization would be
around three times that for 550ppmy, and six to eight
times that for 650ppmv. These relationships can be
observed at both the global and regional levels.
Different stabilization targets also require different tim-
ing for the introduction of reduction policies. The
450ppmv stabilization case requires drastic emission
reductions that occur earlier than under the 650ppmv
case. Very rapid increases in emission reduction over
20 to 30 years are also observed in the 450ppmv stabi-
lization case.

¢ In the 450ppmv stabilization scenarios, the middle
range (between the 25"" and 75"" percentiles) of Annex
I emissions in 2010 lies between the Kyoto target and a
19% reduction from 1990 levels. This range increases
after 2010, as does the decrease in Annex I emissions
that would be needed to achieve stabilization at 450
ppmy. The percent reduction from 1990 levels in the
middle range of scenarios is 13%-34% in 2020 and
11%-52% in 2030;

¢ In the S550ppmv stabilization scenarios, the middle
range of Annex I emissions in 2010 is around the Kyoto
target (from an 11% decrease to a 5% increase from
1990 levels); in 2020, the middle range of emissions
lies between a 17% decrease and an 8% increase from
1990 levels; and in 2030, it lies between an 18%
decrease and an 8% increase from 1990 levels. The
average level of emissions slightly decreases after
2010; and

¢ The 650 or 750ppmv stabilization scenarios show sim-
ilar changes in emission levels in 2010 compared to
1990, and few of them show any additional reduction in
Annex I emissions after 2010. The middle range of
emissions lies between an increase of 1%-17% from
1990 levels in 2020, and an increase of 4%-21% from
1990 levels in 2030.

Assuming that all the CO, reductions for concentration
stabilization are undertaken in Annex I countries, most
of the post-SRES scenarios indicate that per capita
Annex I emissions would fall below per capita non-
Annex I emissions in the 21‘ century. This situation
occurs before 2050 in two-thirds of the scenarios. Only
in the A1T or BI worlds would per capita CO, emis-
sions in developing countries remain below those of
developed countries in the 21 century.

These timings are significantly affected by the time
series of emission reductions in the scenarios, and con-
sequently they diverge in the scenarios. However, com-
parison within individual models suggests that the
lower the stabilization level, the earlier that Annex I per
capita emissions fall below non-Annex I per capita
emissions. Stabilization scenarios based on higher
emission worlds such as A1FI and A2 also tend to show
earlier timing for Annex I to fall below non-Annex I per
capita emissions compared to scenarios based on the
lower emission worlds of B1 or AIT. This suggests that
the stabilization target and the baseline emission level
are both important determinants of the timing when
developing countries’ emissions might need to diverge
from their baseline emissions.

the equity analysis, because this index is closely related to per

In the development-emphasized worlds (A1B and A2)
climate policy would reduce per capita final energy in
both the Annex I and non-Annex I countries, while in
the environment-emphasized worlds (B1 and B2) cli-
mate policy would have little effect on energy use.
These impacts would slightly improve equity in per
capita final energy use between the Annex I and non-
Annex I countries, because the reduction in energy use
caused by climate policies would be larger in Annex I
than in non-Annex I.

However, the impact of climate policies on equity in
per capita final energy use would be much smaller than
that of the future development path. The differences
among the various SRES baseline conditions have the
largest impact upon whether per capita energy use val-
ues converge between Annex I and non-Annex | coun-
tries, with the highest degree of convergence occurring
in the A1B and B1 worlds. This can be seen in Figure
2.19 by comparing the (smaller) change in energy use
between regions within each of the four columns (i.e.,
between the baseline and the SSppmv stabilization sce-
nario for each world) with the (much larger) change
between regions across each of the two rows (i.e.,
across the baseline or across the 550ppmv stabilization
scenario).

"ALLILLEL GOIN WULIEDS.

The timing and the pace of the emissions reduction are
particularly influenced by the region’s resource avail-
ability. Regions with large amounts of cheap fossil fuel
reserves and resources (ASIA: coal; EFSU: natural gas)
rely comparatively longer on fossil fuel-based power
generation. In the long run the emissions mitigation
measures are predominantly the result of the technolo-
gy assumptions consistent with the scenario storylines.
In the fossil-intensive A2 scenario, emissions reduction
for 2100 in ASIA and EFSU are mainly a result of shifts
to advanced fossil technologies in combination with
carbon scrubbing and/or removal and increasing shares
of solar-photovoltaic, and advanced nuclear technolo-
gies. For the B2 scenario, the shift towards non-fossil
fuels in ASIA and EFSU is more complete, and hence,
scrubbing plays a less important role. In A2 and B2,
synthetic fuel production from biomass plays a key role
in the ALM region. In both scenarios the emissions mit-
igation in the OECD region is because of shifts to wind,
solar-photovoltaic, biomass, and nuclear technologies.
In the OECD, fossil fuels contribute roughly 30% to the
power generation, which comes predominantly from
fuel cells (MESSAGE-MACRO team: Riahi and
Roehrl, 2000).

In the 550ppmv cases, the composition of primary
energy is diversified, with increased shares of various
renewable energy sources, nuclear power, and natural
gas. Among the renewable energy sources, photo-
voltaics (PV) seem to be the most promising abatement
measure in the Al and A2 scenarios, where the final
energy demands grow quite substantially, while CO,
recovery and disposal measures play a very important
"	List
"role in the B1 and B2 scenarios. In the case of A1B and
A2, PV would increase rapidly especially in the Middle
East and North Africa (ALM) where PV panels could
be set in wide desert areas. For the entire SRES world,
methanol would be made from hydrogen (H,) and car-
bon monoxide (CO) through gas splitting mainly in the
Former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe (EFSU)
where there are plenty of natural gas resources. Wind
energy production would play an important role in
North America (LDNE team: Yamaji et al., 2000).

In the A1B and AIT worlds, expansion of biomass uti-
lization is the major strategy, rather than nuclear power,
for carbon emission control in OECD and EFSU. In the
latter, biomass mainly substitutes for natural gas in
public and other sectors, and a shift from coal to natur-
al gas in the industry sector is also observed. Nuclear
power is mainly used in the Asia-Pacific and ALM
regions. In contrast, the B1 scenarios give very similar
figures among regions, except for a small increase of
biomass in the OECD region. Carbon sequestration is
implemented in all regions for the purpose of carbon
emission control. B2 scenarios are basically similar to
those of the Al family, except that nuclear energy and
biomass are introduced in the OECD region (MARIA
team: Mori, 2000).

In the Al and B1 families, technology transfer to devel-
oping countries would occur with respect to renewable
energy production, unconventional oil and gas
exploitation, and nuclear power generation. In these
worlds, there would be a large increase in biomass use
in the Asia and ALM regions. Coal is mainly produced
in the Asia-Pacific region. Nuclear technology is wide-
ly used in developing regions. In the A2 and B2 worlds,
energy supply and use heavily depend on local energy
resources because of international trade barriers. The
Asia-Pacific region will rely on nuclear energy and
coal, while ALM may use much renewable energy. The
OECD region makes much use of advanced end-use
technology and modern renewable energy technolo-
gies. Large gas resources in the EFSU region can satis-
fy much of the energy demand in that region (AIM
team: Jiang et al., 2000).

The allocation of carbon “taxes” across regions based
on their per capita GDP levels leads to substantial dif-

cost of renewable energy (Latin America). The lowest
relative reductions are achieved in regions with low per
capita GDP and a relatively high cost of renewable
energy (e.g., Africa) (ASF team: Sankovski ef al.,

"	Title
"A new type of policy assessment has been conducted by the
post-SRES activities, with nine modelling teams quantifying
various simulation cases. Even though stabilization scenarios
show a range among the models, several common trends and
characteristics can be observed.

"One of the major results of the post-SRES analyses is the iden-
tification of “robust climate policy options” across the differ-
ent SRES worlds as well as across different stabilization tar-
gets. Most of the modelling teams have identified several such
options based on their simulations. The following list summa-

century, even with the stabilization of CO, concentra-
tion (LDNE and WorldScan teams).

"The above results are found with robust technology and/or pol-
icy measures across the SRES worlds and across different sta-
bilization targets, and many of them are common among dif-
ferent modelling teams. A part of these common results can be
tested by more detailed analyses of emission reduction sources,

High-income regions with limited fossil fuel resources,
such as Europe and the USA, will probably be among
the first to introduce high-efficiency and non-carbon
technologies. This results over time in sizeable cost
reductions, enabling less industrialized regions to
replace their indigenous coal use by these relatively
capital-intensive supply side options.

Large and continuous energy efficiency improvements
are common features of mitigation scenarios in all the
different SRES worlds;

Introduction of low-carbon energy is also a common
feature of all scenarios, especially biomass energy intro-
duction over the next one hundred years and natural gas
introduction in the first half of the 21% century;

Solar energy and other renewable energy sources could
play an important role in climate stabilization in the lat-
ter half of the 21% century, especially for higher emis-
sion baselines or lower stabilization levels; and
Mitigation scenarios with reduced fossil fuel use will
further decrease regional sulphur emissions and hence
open up the possibility of earlier and larger climate
change effects.
"	List
"The post-SRES analyses supplied several other findings from
individual model simulations. The AIM and the MESSAGE-
MACRO teams as well as other teams found that technological
progress plays a very important role in stabilization, and that
knowledge transfer to developing countries is a key issue in
facilitating their participation in early CO, emission reduction.
With respect to policy integration, the AIM team found that
integration between climate policies and domestic policies
could effectively reduce GHGs in developing regions from
their baselines, especially for the next two or three decades. On
the other hand, the MESSAGE-MACRO team estimated that
regional air pollution control with respect to sulphur emissions
tends to: (1) amplify global climate change in the medium-term
perspective, and (2) accelerate the shift towards less carbon
(and sulphur) intensive fuels such as renewables. The
MiniCAM team concluded that agriculture and land use and
energy system controls need to be linked, and that failure to do
this can lead to much larger than necessary costs.

"KKobust policies include technological elliciency
improvements for both energy use technology and
energy supply technology, social efficiency improve-
ments such as public transport introduction, demateri-
alization promoted by lifestyle changes and the intro-
duction of recycling systems, and renewable energy
incentives through the introduction of energy price
incentives such as a carbon tax (AIM, IMAGE,
MARIA, MiniCAM (Pitcher, 2000), PETRO
(Kverndokk et al., 2000), and WorldScan teams);

It would be reasonable to start with energy conserva-
tion and reforestation to cope with global warming.
However, innovative supply-side technologies will
eventually be required to achieve stabilization of
atmospheric CO, concentration (AIM, ASF, IMAGE,
and LDNE teams);

Robust options across the SRES worlds are natural gas
and the use of biomass resources. Innovative transi-
tional strategies of using natural gas as a “bridge”
towards a carbon-free hydrogen economy (including
CO, sequestration) are at a premium in a possible
future world with low emissions (MESSAGE-
MACRO, AIM, MARIA, and MiniCAM teams);

In all mitigation scenarios, gas combined-cycle tech-
nology bridges the transition to more advanced fossil
(fuel) and zero-carbon technologies. The future elec-
tricity sector is not dominated by any single dominant
technology, however, hydrogen fuel cells are assumed
to be the most promising technology among all stabi-
lization cases (MESSAGE-MACRO, IMAGE, and
MiniCAM teams);

Climate stabilization requires the introduction of natur-
al gas and biomass energy in the first half of the 21sT
century, and either nuclear energy or carbon removal
and storage in the latter half of the century as the cost
effective pathways. Carbon removal and storage has a
role to play in high emission worlds such as A1FI and
A1B for the serious or moderate targets (LDNE,
MiniCAM, and MARIA teams);

Even in the B1 world there are very difficult decisions

"Integration between global climate policies and domestic air
pollution abatement policies could effectively reduce GHG
emissions in developing regions for the next two or three
decades. However, control of sulphur emissions could amplify
possible climate change, and partial trade-offs are likely to per-
sist for environmental policies in the medium term.

"Policies governing agriculture and land use and energy systems
need to be linked for climate change mitigation. Failure to do
this can lead to much larger than necessary costs. At tight lev-
els of control, even some ability to acquire additional emis-

reducing impacts. Moreover, a high potential supply of bio-
mass energy would ameliorate the burden of carbon emission
reductions.

"gy have a greater mitigation potential than reductions in the
energy intensity of GDP in the latter half of the 21% century,
while energy intensity reduction is greater than carbon intensi-
ty reduction in the beginning of the century. This result appears
to be robust across the storylines and stabilization levels, if
drastic social changes are not assumed for energy efficiency
improvement. In an A1B or A2 world, either nuclear power or
carbon sequestration would become increasingly important for
GHG concentration stabilization, the more so if stabilization
targets are lower. Solar energy could play an important role in
climate stabilization in the latter half of the 21‘ century, espe-
cially for a higher emission baseline or lower stabilization lev-
els.
"	Text
"The stabilization level chosen also significantly affects tech-
nology and/or policy measures and the timing of their intro-
duction. More stringent stabilization targets require earlier
emission reductions from baseline levels. The post-SRES sce-
nario analysis suggests that stabilization at 450ppmv will
require emissions reductions in Annex | countries that go sig-
nificantly beyond the Kyoto Protocol commitments. It also
suggests that maintaining emissions at the level of the Kyoto
commitments may be adequate for achieving stabilization at
550ppmv or higher, although it should be recognized that sev-
eral scenarios do indicate the need for significant emission
reductions by 2020 in order to achieve these stabilization lev-
els.
"	Text
"With respect to the important policy question of the role of
developing countries in GHG emission mitigation, a prelimi-
nary finding of the post-SRES scenario analysis is that, assum-
ing that the CO, emission reduction needed for stabilization
occurs in Annex I countries only, per capita CO, emissions in
Annex I countries would fall below per capita emissions in non-
Annex I countries during the 21‘ century except in some of
AIT and B1 stabilization scenarios, and this occurs before 2050
in two-thirds of the scenarios. This suggests that, especially for
more stringent stabilization targets and/or worlds with relative-
ly high baseline emissions, there is a need for emissions to
diverge from baseline levels in developing countries. The stabi-
lization target and the baseline emission level were both impor-
tant determinants of the timing when developing countries
emissions might need to diverge from their baseline emissions.
"	Text
"The different SRES baseline worlds require different technolo-
gy and/or policy measures to stabilize at the same level. The
AIF1, A1B, and A2 worlds require a wider range of stronger
technology and/or policy measures than A1T, B1, and B2. For
example, energy efficiency improvements in all sectors, the
introduction of low-carbon energy, and afforestation would all
be required in the AIF1, A1B, and A2 worlds in the first half
of the 21% century, with the additional introduction of
advanced technologies in renewable energy and other energy
sources in the second half of the 21* century. The level of tech-
nology and/or policy measures in the beginning of this century
would be significantly affected by the choice of development
path over the next one hundred years. Higher emission worlds
such as AIF1 and A2 require earlier reduction than low emis-
sion worlds such as AIT and B1.

"A number of new technologies and practices have gained
importance since the Second Assessment Report (SAR). As a
result, greater opportunities for energy efficiency are available,
often at lower cost than was expected. Annual growth in glob-
al consumption of primary energy and related carbon dioxide
emissions dropped to 1.3% and 1.4%, respectively, between
1990 and 1998 after experiencing much higher growth rates of
2.4% and 2.1% between 1971 and 1990. This decrease in
growth rate is because of the combined effects of improved
energy efficiency technologies, increased fuel switching and
adoption of renewable energy sources, and the dramatic
decrease in emissions of countries with economies in transition
(EITs) as a result of economic changes (Figures 3.] and 3.2).

"The technological and economic potential to reduce green-
house gas (GHG) emissions is large enough to hold annual
global greenhouse gas emissions to levels close to or even
below those of 2000 by 2010 and even lower by 2020.
Realization of these reductions requires combined actions in all
sectors of the economy including adoption of energy-efficient
technologies and practices, increased fuel switching toward
lower carbon fuels, continued growth in the use of efficient gas
turbines and combined heat and power systems, greater
reliance on renewable energy sources, reduced methane emis-

provide sinks and offsets, increased recovery of landfill
methane for electricity production and increased recycling,
reduction in the release of industrial gases, more efficient vehi-
cles, physical sequestration of CO,, and improving end-use
efficiency while protecting the ozone layer. Countervailing
socioeconomic and behavioural trends that cause greenhouse
gas emissions to increase also exist, including increased size of
dwelling units, increased sales of heavier and more powerful
vehicles, growing vehicle kilometers travelled, reduced incen-
tives for efficient use of energy or the purchase of energy effi-

gies, current rates of energy efficiency improvements alone
will not be sufficient to significantly reduce greenhouse gas
emissions in the near term. In addition, policies or programmes
to increase energy efficiency and promote renewable energy
technology are lacking in many countries.
"	Text
"The buildings sector contributes about 31% of global energy-
related carbon dioxide emissions and these emissions grew at
an average annual rate of almost 2.0% between 1971 and 1995.
Growth in emissions varied significantly by region; between
1990 and 1995 the largest annual increases were experienced in
developing countries (around 5.0% per year), moderate growth
was seen in developed countries (around 1.0% per year), and
emissions declined in the EITs (3.0% per year). The growth in
emissions in the developing and developed countries is largely
caused by the increased amenity that consumers demand — in
terms of increased purchase and use of appliances, larger
dwellings, and the modernization and expansion of the com-
mercial sector — as economies grow. Technology has continued
on an evolutionary trajectory with incremental gains during the
past decade in windows, lighting, insulation, space heating,
refrigeration, air conditioning, building controls, passive solar
design, and infiltration reduction. Although CFCs have been
eliminated in developed countries as working fluids in heat
pumps, air conditioners, and refrigerators, and as foam blowing
agents for insulation, research and development (R&D) has
been able to continue to improve energy efficiency of refriger-
ators and cooling and heating systems. Integrated building
design has demonstrated very large reductions in energy use
and greenhouse gas emissions. Expanded R&D is needed to
assure continued technology improvement, but implementation
policies remain the major hurdle to their rapid introduction.
"	Text
"Technological innovation and change are influenced by the dif-
fering needs of different economies and sectors. A large per-
centage of capital is invested in a relatively small number of
technologies that are responsible for a significant share of the
energy supply and consumption market (automobiles, electric
power generators, industrial processes, and building heating
and cooling systems). There is a tendency to optimize these
few technologies and their related infrastructure development,
gaining them advantages and locking them into the economy.
That makes it more difficult for alternative, low-carbon tech-
nologies to compete. For example, a particular technological
configuration such as road-based automobiles has become
“locked-in” as the dominant transportation mode. In industrial
countries, technologies are developed as a result of corporate
innovation or government-supported R&D, and in response to
environmental regulations, utility deregulation, energy tax
policies, or other incentives. In many developing countries,
where electric power capacity and much end-use demand is
growing most rapidly, there is often greater emphasis on get-
ting technology such as electric power generation established
in order to enhance economic development, with less concern
for environmental and other issues. Capital flows and differ-
ing types of technology transfer may also determine technolo-
gy choices. It is important to recognize that often values other
than energy efficiency or greenhouse gas emissions are the
dominant shapers of technological choice and innovation.

increased utilization of methane from landfills and from coal
beds for electric power generation. Significant energy-related
greenhouse gas reductions are identified for improved waste
recycling in the plastics and carpet industries, and through

over whether the greater reduction in lifecycle CO, emissions
occurs through paper recycling or by utilizing waste paper as a
biofuel in waste to energy facilities. In several developed coun-
tries, and especially in Europe and Japan, waste-to-energy
facilities have become more efficient with lower air pollution

option for new electric power generation plants, wherever ade-
quate natural gas supply and infrastructure are available. With
deregulation of the electric power sector, additional emission
reductions have occurred in most countries through the utiliza-
tion of waste heat in combined heat and power systems that are
capable of utilizing 90% of the fossil fuel energy. Low carbon-
emitting technologies such as nuclear power have managed to
significantly increase their capacity factor at existing facilities,
but relatively few new plants are being proposed or built

"Industrial emissions account for over 40% of carbon dioxide
emissions. Global industrial sector carbon dioxide emissions
grew at a rate of 1.5% per year between 1971 and 1995, slow-
ing to 0.4% per year between 1990 and 1995. This is the only
sector that has shown an annual decrease in carbon emissions
in industrial economies (—0.8% per year between 1990 and
1995) as well as in the EITs (-6.4% per year between 1990 and
1995). Emissions from this sector in developing countries,
however, continue to grow (6.3% per year in developing coun-
tries of Asia—Pacific and 3.4% per year in the remaining devel-
oping countries). Substantial differences in the energy efficien-
cy of industrial processes between countries exist.
Improvement of energy efficiency is the most important emis-
sion reduction option in the short term. However, industries
continue to find new, more energy efficient processes which
makes this option also important for the longer term. The larg-
er part of the energy can be saved at net negative costs. In addi-
tion, material efficiency improvement (including more effi-
cient product design, recycling, and material substitution) can
greatly contribute to reducing emissions. For many sources of
non-CO, emissions, like those from the aluminium industry,
and adipic acid and HCFC-22 production, substantial emission
reductions are possible or are already being implemented.

"and declined at a rate of -5.4% per year in the EIT. However,
methane and nitrous oxide emissions dominate the agricultural
sector, which contributes over 20% of global anthropogenic
greenhouse gas emissions in terms of CO, equivalents.
Reductions can be made by improved farm management prac-
tices such as more efficient fertilizer use, better waste treat-
ment, use of minimum tillage techniques, and ruminant
methane reduction strategies. Biotechnology and genetic mod-
ification developments could provide additional future gains
and also lead to reduced energy demand, but the conflict
between food security and environmental risk is yet to be
resolved. Mitigation solutions exist overall for
100-200MC, ,/yr but farmers are unlikely to change their tra-
ditional farming methods without additional incentives.
Diversification of land use to energy cropping has the techni-
cal potential to provide both carbon sinks and offsets in regions
where suitable land and water are available. Transport biofuel
production costs remain high compared with oil products, but
do provide additional value in the form of oxygenates and
increased octane (ethanol). Because of market liberalization
policies, the potential for biofuels has declined, though there is
a growing demand for biodiesel in Germany. Improvements in
biofuel conversion routes, such as the enzymatic hydrolysis of
lignocellulosic material to ethanol, may help narrow the cost
disadvantage versus fossil fuels.

"growth was highest in the developing countries (7.3% per year
in the developing countries of Asia—Pacific and 4.6% per year
in the remaining developing countries), moderate in the devel-
oped countries (1.9% per year) and is actually declining at a
rate of —5.0% per year for the EITs. Technology improvements
may generate operational cost reductions that have a rebound
effect that stimulates further personal transportation use. These
issues show the necessity of both policies and behavioural
changes to lower emissions from the transport sector. Hybrid
gasoline-electric vehicles have been introduced on a commer-
cial basis with fuel economies 50% to 100% better than that of
comparably sized four-passenger vehicles. The development of
extremely low-polluting engines may reduce the incentive for
hybrid and battery electric vehicles that were previously
thought to encourage the adoption of vehicles that would also
reduce greenhouse gases. Lightweight materials have the
potential to improve fuel economy for all land transport. Fuel
cell powered vehicles are developing rapidly, and could be
introduced to the market sometime during the coming decade.
Substantial potential for improving the fuel economy of heavy-
duty trucks seems feasible. Only incremental improvements of
the order of 1%/yr are expected for aircraft over the next sev-
eral decades. There appears to be little attention being given to
rail or public transportation systems, but waterborne transport
of freight is already highly efficient, and has potential for addi-
tional gains.

"This chapter concludes with a quantification of the potential
for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the various
end-use sectors of the economy and through changes in energy
supply. It is found that sufficient technological potential exists
to stabilize or lower global greenhouse gas emissions by 2010,
and to provide for further reductions by 2020. The quantifica-
tion is based on sector-specific analyses and, thus, caution
should be taken when adding up the various estimates resulting
from interactions between different types of technologies.
These sector-based analyses can be used to provide further
understanding of the results of global mitigation scenarios,
such as those presented in Chapter 2, which account for inter-
sectoral interactions, but typically do not provide estimates of
sectoral level GHG emissions reduction potential or costs.
"	Text
"Some of the costs associated with sector specific options for
reducing GHG emissions may appear high (for example
US$300/C,,). However, we estimate that there is technologi-
cal potential for reductions of between 1,900 and
2,600MIC,,/yr in 2010 and 3,600 to 5,0SOMtC,,/yr in 2020.
Half of these reductions are achievable at net negative costs
(value of energy saved is greater than capital, operating and
maintenance costs), and most of the remainder is available at a
cost of less than US$100IC, ,/yr. The continued development
and adoption of a wide range of greenhouse gas mitigation
technologies and practices will result not only in a large tech-
nical and economic potential for reducing greenhouse gas
emissions but will also provide continued means for pursuing
sustainable development goals.

"Further analysis since the SAR suggests that physical seques-
tration of CO, underground in aquifers, in depleted gas and oil
fields, or in the deep ocean is potentially a viable option.
Technical feasibility has been demonstrated for CO, removal
and storage from a natural gas field, but long-term storage and
economic viability remain to be demonstrated. Environmental
implications of ocean sequestration are still being evaluated.
The utilization of hydrogen from fossil fuels, biomass, or solid
waste followed by sequestration appears particularly attractive.
Along with biological sequestration, physical sequestration
might complement current efforts at improving energy effi-
ciency, fuel switching, and the further development and imple-
mentation of renewables, but it must compete economically
with them.

? The IEA explains: “Countries often have several ‘official’ sources of
data such as a Ministry, a Central Bureau of Statistics, a nationalized
electricity company, etc. Data can also be collected from the energy
suppliers, the energy consumers or the customs statistics. The IEA
tries to collect the most accurate data, but does not necessarily have
access to the complete data set that may be available to national
experts calculating emissions inventories for the UNFCCC” (IEA,
1997c).

"' The data in this table differ slightly from the data presented in
Figures 3.1 and 3.2 because those figures are based on IEA data alone
while the data in the table represents a combination of IEA and British
Petroleum data (further described in the next paragraph of the text).
Also, in Figure 3.1, primary energy was calculated using IEA’s phys-
ical energy content method which is based on the primary energy
sources used to produce heat and electricity (IEA, 2000) while in
Table 3.1, primary energy was calculated using a standard electricity

"In general, energy supply statistics, and their disaggregation
into fuel types, are more reliable than statistics for energy
demand. In particular, the estimates of sectoral energy demand
(buildings, industry, transportation, agriculture) and the further
disaggregation into subsectors (e.g., residential and commer-
cial buildings; auto transportation; specific industries), and
then into end uses has relatively high levels of uncertainty for
at least two reasons. First, the full data to perform these disag-
gregations are rarely gathered at the national level, so that
assumptions and approximations need to be made. Second, the
conventions vary among different countries as to what energy
use belongs to which sector or subsector (e.g., the distinction

"It is likely that total commercial energy production and
demand estimates will be known accurately for most devel-
oped countries (within one or a few per cent), relatively accu-
rately for some developing countries (with an uncertainty of
1% to 5%), and less accurately for developing countries with
poorly functioning data gathering and statistical systems.
Converting the energy data into carbon emissions introduces
some increased uncertainty — primarily as a consequence of the
fraction of natural gas that leaks to the atmosphere and the
fraction of all fossil fuels that are left uncombusted — the uncer-
tainty in carbon emissions is greater than that of energy use.
Uncertainties in non-CO, greenhouse gas emissions are greater
than those for carbon emissions.

"(IEA) is not homogeneous because of the use of various report-
ing mechanisms and “official” sources of national data (IEA,
1997a; IEA, 1997b; IEA, 1997c)*. Second, for the economies
in transition, primary energy use data and carbon dioxide data
are from two different sources (BP, 1997; IEA, 1997a; IEA,
1997b; IEA, 1997c). There are inconsistencies between the two
sources, and no analysis has yet been done to resolve them.
Third, IEA statistics report sectoral data for the industrial and
transport sectors, but not for buildings and agriculture, which
are reported as “other”. These sectors have been estimated
using an allocation scheme described in Price er al. (1998). In
general, the most uncertainty is associated with data for the
economies in transition region, and for the commercial and res-
idential sub-categories of the buildings sector in all regions.

"Table 3.1 shows energy consumption in the four end-use sectors
of the global economy — industry, buildings, transport, and agri-
culture—over time!. Data are displayed for six world regions —
developed countries, countries with economies in transition
(EITs), developing Asia-Pacific countries, Africa, Latin America
and the Middle East. Comparing global annual average growth
rates (AAGRs) for primary energy use in the period 1971 to
1990 and 1990 to 1995 a significant decrease is noticed— from
2.5% in the first period to about 1.0% in the latter, due almost
entirely to the economic crisis in the EITs. Overall, growth aver-
aged about 2.0% per year from 1971 to 1995. Table 3.1 also
shows carbon dioxide emissions from energy consumption for
four world regions. The AAGR of global carbon dioxide emis-
sions from the use of energy also declined (from 2% to 1%) in
the same periods. A different picture emerges if the countries
with economies in transition are excluded. In this case, growth
in world energy use averaged about 2.5% per year in both the
1971 to 1990 and 1990 to 1995 periods, while average annual
growth in carbon dioxide emissions was 2.0% and 2.6% during
the same time periods, respectively.

"Technologies and measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
are continuously being developed (Nadel ef al., 1998; National
Laboratory Directors, 1997; PCAST, 1997; Martin et al., 2000).
Many of these technologies focus on improving the efficiency of
fossil fuel use since more than two-thirds of the greenhouse gas
emissions addressed in the Kyoto Protocol (in carbon dioxide
equivalents) are related to the use of energy. Energy intensity
(energy consumed divided by gross domestic product (GDP))
and carbon dioxide intensity (CO, emitted from burning fossil
fuels divided by the amount of energy produced) have been
declining for more than 100 years in developed countries with-
out explicit government policies for decarbonization and both
have the potential to decline further. Non-fossil fuel energy
sources are also being developed and implemented as a means
of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Physical and biological
sequestration of CO, can potentially play a role in reducing
greenhouse gas emissions in the future. Other technologies and
measures focus on reducing emissions of the remaining major
greenhouse gases - methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons
(HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulphur hexafluoride
(SF,)(see Section 3.5 and Appendix to this Chapter).

the release of products of incomplete combustion — which are

"An important observation from Table 3./ is the high AAGR in
the transport sector for energy and carbon emission. AAGR is
not only the greatest for the transport sector, but it has slowed
only slightly since 1960 despite significant improvements in
technology. Because of the increase in the number of vehicles,
and the recent decline in energy efficiency gains as vehicles
have become larger and more powerful, transportation now is
responsible for 22% of CO, emission from fuel use (1995).
Unlike electricity, which can be produced from a variety of
fuels, air and road transport is almost entirely fuelled with
petroleum, except for ethanol and biodiesel used in a few coun-
tries. Biomass-derived fuels and hydrogen production from
fossil fuels with carbon sequestration technology, in parallel
with improved fuel efficiency conversion, are some of the few
more promising alternatives for reducing significantly carbon
emissions in the transport sector for the next two decades. The
accelerated introduction of hybrid and fuel cell vehicles is also
promising, but these gains are already being offset by increased
driving, and the rapid growth of the personal vehicle market
worldwide.

"will be the last mitigation option to be adopted because of cost
(National Laboratory Directors, 1997). Nevertheless, with
appropriate policies, economic barriers can be minimized,
opening possibilities for all the three categories of mitigation
options. Considering the large number of available technolo-
gies in all categories and the still modest results obtained to
date (see Table 3.1), it is possible to infer that their commer-
cial uses are being constrained by market barriers and failures
as well as a lack of adequate policies to induce the use of more
costly mitigation options (see Chapters 5 and 6). This should
not be interpreted as a reason to reduce R&D efforts and fund-
ing, since technological advances always help to cut costs and
consequently reduce the amount and intensity of policies
needed to overcome the existing economic barriers.
Implementing new technological solutions could start soon by
establishing policies that will encourage demand for these
devices and practices. Complex technological innovations
advance through a non-linear, interactive innovation process
in which there is synergy between scientific research, technol-
ogy development, and deployment activities (OTA, 1995a;
Branscomb et al., 1997; R&D Magazine, 1997). Early tech-
nology demand can be stimulated through well-placed policy
mechanisms.

"The most rapid growth in the electric power sector and many
energy intensive industries is now occurring in developing
countries, which have come to rely heavily upon technology
transfer for investments in energy infrastructure. Capital for
investment flows from industrial countries to developing coun-
tries through several pathways such as multilateral and bilater-
al official development assistance (ODA), foreign direct
investments (FDI), commercial sales, and commercial and
development bank lending. During the period 1993 to 1997,
ODA experienced a downward trend with an increase in 1998,
while FDI has increased substantially by a factor of five (see
Figure 3.3) (OECD, 1999; Metz et al., 2000). This shift is a
consequence of the many opportunities that have opened for
private capital in developing countries, and a reluctance by
some industrial countries to increase ODA. The energy supply
sector of developing countries is also undergoing deregulation
from state to private ownership, increasing the role of the pri-
vate sector in technology innovation.

"Cost data are presented in this chapter for many mitigation
options. They are derived from a large number of studies and
are not fully comparable. However, in general, the following
holds for the studies quoted in this Chapter. The specific miti-
gation costs related to the implementation of an option are cal-
culated as the difference of levelized costs> over the difference
in greenhouse gas emissions (both in comparison to the situa-
tion without implementation of the option). Costs are general-
ly calculated on a project basis (for a definition see Chapter 7,
Section 7.3.1). The discount rates used in the cost calculation
reflect real public sector discount rates (for a discussion of dis-
count rates, see Chapter 7, Section 7.2.4). Generally, the dis-
count rates in the quoted studies are in the range of 5%—-12%
per year. It should be noted that the discount rates used here are
lower than those typically used in private sector decision mak-
ing. This means that options reported in this chapter to have
negative net costs will not necessarily be taken up by the mar-
ket. Furthermore, it should be noted that in some cases even
small specific costs may form a substantial burden for compa-
nies.

"A large percentage of capital is invested in a relatively small
number of technologies that are responsible for a significant
share of the energy supply and consumption market (automo-
biles, electric power generators, and building heating and
cooling systems). There is a tendency to optimize these few
technologies and their related infrastructure development,
gaining them advantages that will make it more difficult for
subsequent competing technologies to catch up. For example,
a particular technological configuration such as road-based
automobiles can become “locked-in” as the dominant trans-
portation mode. This occurs because evolution of technologi-
cal systems is as important as the evolution of individual new
technologies. As their use expands their development becomes
intertwined with the evolution of many other technologies and
institutional and social developments. The evolution of tech-
nologies for oil exploration and extraction and for automobile
production both affect and are affected by the expansion of
infrastructures such as efficient refineries and road networks.
They also affect and are affected by social and institutional
developments, such as political and military power and settle-
ment patterns, and business adaptation to changed transporta-
tion options, respectively.

change and innovation (Mills and Rosenfeld, 1996; Pye and

tributed energy options offer non-energy benefits. One class of
such benefits accrues at the national level, e.g. via improved
competitiveness, energy security, job creation, environmental
protection, while another relates to consumers and their deci-
sion-making processes. From a consumer perspective, it is
often the non-energy benefits that motivate decisions to adopt
such technologies. Consumer benefits from energy-efficient

improved indoor environment, comfort, health, safety, and pro-

"There are multiple government-driven pathways for technolog-
ical innovation and change. Through regulation of energy mar-
kets, environmental regulations, energy efficiency standards,
and market-based initiatives such as energy and emission
taxes, governments can induce technology changes and influ-
ence the level of innovations. Important examples of govern-
ment policies on energy supply include the Clean Air Act in the
USA, the Non Fossil Fuel Obligation in the UK, the Feed-in-
Law in Germany, the Alcohol Transport Fuel Program in
Brazil, and utility deregulation that began in the UK and has
now moved to the USA, Norway, Argentina, and many other
countries. Voluntary agreements or initiatives implemented by
the manufacturing industry, including energy supply sections,
can also be drivers of technological change and innovation.

"In the energy-consuming sector, major government actions can
promote energy efficient use and the replacement of high (like
coal) to lower carbon fuels (like natural gas and renewables).
Energy efficiency standards for vehicles, appliances, heating
and cooling systems, and buildings can also substantially
encourage the adoption of new technologies. On the other
hand, continued subsidies for coal and electricity, and a failure
to properly meter electricity and gas are substantial disincen-
tives to energy efficiency gains and the uptake of renewable
and low carbon technologies. Government-supported R&D has
also played a significant role in developing nuclear power, low
carbon technologies such as gas turbines, and carbon-free ener-
gy sources including wind, solar, and other renewables. Such
government actions in the energy-consuming sector can ensure
increasing access to energy required for sustainable develop-
ment.

"Important dimensions and drivers for the successful transfer of
lower GHG technologies to developing countries and
economies in transition are capacity building, an enabling
environment, and adequate mechanisms for technology trans-
fer (Metz et al., 2000). Markets for the use of new forms of
energy are often non-existent or very small, and require col-
laboration among the local government and commercial or
multilateral lending banks to promote procurement. It may also
be necessary to utilize temporary subsidies and market-based
incentives as well. Because energy is such a critical driver of
development, it is essential that strategies to reduce GHG emis-
sions be consistent with development goals. This is true for all
economies, but is especially true for developing countries and
economies in transition where leap-frogging to modern, low
emitting, highly efficient technologies is critical (Moomaw et
al., 1999a; Goldemberg, 1998).

"CO, from energy use is the dominant greenhouse gas emitted
in the buildings sector, followed by HFCs used in refrigeration,
air conditioning, and foam insulation, and cookstove emissions
of methane and nitrous oxide (see Table 3.2). Developed coun-
tries have the largest emissions of CO, and HFCs, while devel-
oping countries have the largest emissions of greenhouse gases
from non-renewable biomass combustion in cookstoves (Smith
et al., 2000). It is noted, however, that the biomass energy
source is being replaced with non-renewable carbon-based
fuels (Price et al., 1998). This trend is expected to continue.

these buildings is by far the largest source of greenhouse gas

"Energy use in buildings exhibited a steady growth from 1971
through 1990 in all regions of the world, averaging almost 3%
per year. Because of the decline in energy use in buildings in
the former Soviet Union after 1989, global energy use in
buildings has grown slower than for other sectors in recent
years. Growth in commercial buildings was higher than
growth in residential buildings in all regions of the world,
averaging 3.5% per year globally between 1971 and 1990.
Energy-related CO, emissions also grew during this period.
By 1995, CO, emissions from fuels and electricity used in
buildings reached 874MtC and 858MtcC, respectively, for a
total of 1732MtC, or 98% of all buildings-related GHG emis-
sions. Growth in these CO, emissions was slower than the
growth in primary energy in both the developed countries and
the rest-of-world region, most likely the result of fuel switch-
ing to lower carbon fuels in these regions. In contrast, growth
in energy-related CO, emissions in the developing countries
— Asia Pacific region — was 6.3% per year between 1971
and 1995, greater than the 5.5% per year growth in primary
energy use, reflecting a growing reliance on more carbon-
intensive fuels in this region.°
"	Text
"Mitigation Options for Human Settlements (Levine er al.,
1996a). This chapter showed that residential and commercial
buildings accounted for 19% and 10%, respectively, of global
carbon dioxide (CO,) emissions from the use of fossil fuels in
1990. More recent estimates increase this percentage to 21%
for residential buildings and 10.5% for commercial buildings,
both for 1990 and 1995, as shown in Table 3.1. Globally, space
heating is the dominant energy end-use in both residential and
commercial buildings. Developed countries account for the
vast majority of buildings-related CO, emissions, but the bulk
of growth in these emissions over the past two decades was
seen in developing countries. The SAR found that many cost-
effective technologies are available to reduce energy-related
CO, emissions, but that consumers and decision-makers often
do not invest in energy efficiency for a variety of reasons,
including existing economic incentives, levels of information,
and conditions in the market. The SAR concluded that under a
scenario with aggressive adoption of energy-efficiency mea-
sures, cost-effective energy efficiency could likely cut project-
ed baseline growth in carbon emissions from energy use in
buildings by half over the next two decades.

"Product manufacturers often emphasize non-energy benefits as
a driver in their markets, e.g. the noise- and UV-reduction ben-
efits of multi-glazed window systems or the disaster-recovery
benefits of stand-alone photovoltaic technologies. Of particular
interest are attributes of energy-efficient and renewable energy
technologies and practices that reduce insurance risks (Mills
and Rosenfeld, 1996). Approximately 80 specific examples
have been identified with applications in the buildings and
industrial sectors (Vine et al., 1998), and insurers have begun
to promote these in the buildings sector (Mills, 1999). The
insurance sector has also supported transportation energy effi-
ciency improvements that increase highway safety (reduced
speed limits) and urban air quality (mass transportation)
(American Insurance Association, 1999). Insurance industry
concern about increased natural disasters caused by global cli-
mate change also serves as a motivation for innovative market
transformation initiatives on behalf of the industry to support
climate change adaptation and mitigation (Mills 1998, 1999;
Vellinga et al., 2000; Nutter, 1996). Market benefits for indus-

"Driving forces influencing the use of HFCs include both its
suitability as a replacement for CFCs and HCFCs, as well as an
awareness of the contribution of HFCs to global climate
change. It is expected that this awareness will continue to drive
decisions to use HFCs only in highest value applications. Some
countries have enacted regulations limiting emissions of HFCs
while others have established voluntary agreements with

"Key drivers of energy use and related GHG emissions in build-

urbanization, number of households, per capita living area, and
persons per residence), economic variables (change in GDP
and personal income), energy efficiency trends, and carbon
intensity trends. These factors are in turn driven by changes in
consumer preferences, energy and technology costs, settlement

"Non-CO, greenhouse gas emissions from the buildings sector
are hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)’ used or projected to be used in
residential and commercial refrigerators, air conditioning sys-
tems, and in open and closed cell foam for insulation. HFCs in
the building sector were essentially zero in 1995, but are pro-
jected to grow as they replace ozone-depleting substances (see
Appendix to this chapter). In addition, methane (CH,), nitrous
oxide (N,O), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxides
(NO,) (along with CO,) are produced through combustion of
biomass in cookstoves (Levine et al., 1996b; Smith er al.,
2000). It is estimated the biomass cookstoves emit about
40M, ,, 2% of total buildings-related GHG emissions (Smith
et al., 2000). These emissions are concentrated in developing
countries, where biomass fuels can account for more than 40%
of the total energy used in residences (UNDP, 1999).8

"Global projections of primary energy use for the buildings sec-
tor show a doubling, from 103EJ to 208EJ, between 1990 and
2020 in a baseline scenario (WEC, 1995a). The most rapid
growth is seen in the commercial buildings sector, which is
projected to grow at an average rate of 2.6% per year. Increases
in energy use in the EITs are projected to be as great as those
in the developing countries, as these countries recover from the
economic crises and as the growth in developing countries
begins to slow. Under a scenario where state-of-the-art tech-
nology is adopted, global primary energy consumption in the
buildings sector will only grow to about 170EJ in 2020. A more
aggressive “ecologically driven/advanced technology” sce-
nario, which assumes an international commitment to energy
efficiency as well as rapid technological progress and wide-
spread application of policies and programmes to speed the
adoption of energy-efficient technologies in all major regions
of the world, results in primary energy use of 140EJ in 2020

rapid growth is seen in the developing countries, which show
an average growth in buildings-related carbon dioxide emis-

"Integrated building design focuses on exploiting energy-saving
opportunities associated with building siting as well as syner-
gies between building components such as windows, insula-
tion, equipment, and heating, air conditioning, and ventilation
systems. Installing increased insulation and energy-efficient
windows, for example, allows for installation of smaller heat-
ing and cooling equipment and reduced or eliminated duct-
work.!° Most importantly, it will become possible in the future
to design a building where operation can be monitored, con-
trolled, and faults detected and analyzed automatically. For
large commercial buildings, such systems (which are currently
under development) have the potential to create significant
energy savings as well as other operational benefits. Two
recent projects that used integrated building design for resi-
dential construction found average energy savings between
30% and 60% per cent (Elberling and Bourne, 1996; Hoeschele
et al., 1996; Parker et al., 1996), while for commercial build-

et al., 1996; Hernandez et al., 1998; Parker et al., 1997;
Thayer, 1995; Suozzo and Nadel, 1998). Assuming an average
savings of 40% for integrated building design, the cost of saved
energy for residential and commercial buildings has been cal-
culated to be around US$3/GJ (the average cost of energy in
the US buildings sector is about US$14/GJ) (Nadel et al.,

efficient switch-mode power supplies and smarter batteries, are
low (Nadel er al., 1998) and a recent study found that if all US

"The average annual increase in urban population was nearly
4.0% per year in Asia and Rest of World regions. This
increased urbanization led to increased use of commercial
fuels, such as kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), for
cooking instead of traditional biomass fuels. In general, higher
levels of urbanization are associated with higher incomes and
increased household energy use, including significantly
increased purchase and use of a variety of household appli-
ances (Sathaye ef al., 1989; Nadel et al., 1997, Sathaye and
Ketoff, 1991). Wealthier populaces in developing countries
exhibit consumption patterns similar to those in developed
countries, where purchases of appliances and other energy-
using equipment increase with gains in disposable income
(WEC, 1995a).

"Developed countries have by far the largest CO, emis-
sions from the buildings sector and have exhibited a
relatively steady long-term trend of annual primary
energy growth in the 1.8% to 1.9% range (with lower
growth through 1985 and higher growth thereafter).
Since the late 1980s, energy use and related CO, emis-
sions from buildings in the developing countries, par-
ticularly in the Asia-Pacific region, have grown about
five times as fast as the global average (and more than
twice as fast as in developed countries).

The growth rate of buildings’ energy use globally has
declined since 1990 because of the economic crisis in
the EITs. The world other than the EITs continued its
long-term trend (1971-1995) of annual energy growth
in the 2.8% to 2.9% range.

"Distributed power generation relies on small power generation
or storage systems located near or at the building site. Several
small scale (below 500kW), dispersed power-generating tech-
nologies are advancing quite rapidly. These technologies
include both renewable and fossil fuel powered alternatives,
such as photovoltaics and microturbines. Moving power gen-
eration closer to electrical end-uses results in reduced system
electrical losses, the potential for combined heat and power
applications (especially for building cooling), and opportuni-
ties to better co-ordinate generation and end-use, which can
together more than compensate for the lower conversion effi-
ciency and result in overall energy systems that are both less
expensive and emit less carbon dioxide than the familiar cen-
tral power generating station. The likelihood of customer sites
becoming net generators will be determined by the configura-
tion of the building and/or site, the opportunities for on-site use
of cogenerated heat, the availability and relative cost of fuels,
and utility interconnection, environmental, building code, and
other regulatory restrictions (NRECA, 2000).

"Photovoltaic systems are being increasingly used in rural off-
grid locations, especially in developing countries, to provide
electricity to areas not yet connected to the power infrastruc-
ture or to offset fossil fuel generated electricity. These systems
are most commonly used to provide electricity for lighting, but
are also used for water pumping, refrigeration, evaporative
cooling, ventilation fans, air conditioning, and powering vari-
ous electronic devices. In 1995, more than 200,000 homes
worldwide depended on photovoltaic systems for all of their
electricity needs (US DOE, 1999a). Between 1986 and 1998,
global PV sales grew from 37MW to 1SOMW (US DOE,
1999b). Rural electrification programmes have been estab-
lished in many developing countries. In Brazil, more than 1000
small stand-alone systems that provide power for lighting,
TVs, and radios were recently installed in homes and schools,
while two hybrid (PV-wind-battery) power systems were
installed in the Amazon Basin to reduce the use of diesel gen-
erators that supply power to more than 300 villages in that area
(Taylor, 1997). Similar projects have been initiated in South
Africa (Arent, 1998), Egypt (Taylor and Abulfotuh, 1997),
India (Stone and Ullal, 1997; US DOE, 1999b), Mexico
(Secretaria de Energia, 1997), China, Indonesia, Nepal, Sri
Lanka, Vietnam, Uganda, Solomon Islands, and Tanzania
(Williams, 1996). Recent developments promoting increased
adoption of photovoltaic systems include the South African
Solar Rural Electrification Project (Shell International, 1999),
the US Million Solar Roofs Initiative (US DOE, 1999a), the
effort to install 5OOOMW on residences in Japan by 2010
(Advisory Committee for Energy, 1998), and net metering,

are producing energy in excess of residential requirements (US

"Space heating is the largest end-use in the developed countries
as a whole and in the EIT region (Nadel et a/., 1997), although

40% of dwellings to almost 80% of dwellings in many devel-

ing countries, with the exception of the northern half of China,
Korea, Argentina, and a few other South American countries

declined over the past two decades; for example, new refriger-
ators in the US were 65% less energy-intensive in 1993 than in
1972, accounting for differences in size or performance (IEA,
1997d; Schipper et al., 1996). Electricity use and intensity
(MJ/m?) increased rapidly in the commercial buildings sector
as the use of lighting, air conditioning, computers, and other
office equipment has grown. Fuel intensity (PJ/m?) declined
rapidly in developed countries as the share of energy used for
space heating in commercial buildings dropped as a result of
thermal improvements in buildings (Krackeler ef al., 1998).
Fuel use declined faster than electricity consumption
increased, with the result that primary energy use per square
meter of commercial sector floor area gradually declined in
most developed countries.

"Historically, transportation energy use and GHG emissions
have increased because reductions in energy intensities have
not kept pace with increasing transport activity. The world’s
motor vehicle fleet grew at an average annual rate of 4.5%
from 1970 to 1990. Over the same period, light-duty vehicle
fuel economy improved by 2% per year or less. Increases in
vehicular fuel economy have also been accompanied by
declining vehicle occupancy rates. It is noted below that the
fuel economy of road passenger transport vehicles has lev-
elled off since the publication of the SAR, and no longer
appears to be improving. Air travel and truck freight activity
have also grown more rapidly than energy intensities (energy
use per passenger km) have declined. Since 1970, transport

"Since the publication of the SAR, important advances have
been achieved in several areas of automotive technology.
Among the most significant are: (1) two global automotive
manufacturers are now selling hybrid automobiles 5-10 years
ahead of what was anticipated just 5 years ago; (2) dramatic
reductions have been made in fuel cell cost and size, such that
several manufacturers have announced that they will introduce
fuel cell vehicles by 2005, 10-20 years ahead of what was pre-
viously anticipated; and (3) improvements in fuels, engine con-
trols, and emissions after-treatment led to the production of a
gasoline internal combustion engine vehicle with virtually zero
emissions of urban air pollutants. This achievement, combined
with regulations requiring low-sulphur fuels, may foreshadow
the development of acceptable emissions control systems for
more energy efficient direct injection engines, although signif-
icant hurdles remain. It may also reduce the incentive for
adopting alternative fuel vehicles, such as battery electric and
natural gas vehicles, which can also have lower greenhouse gas
emissions. These developments could have profound effects on
future GHG emissions from road, rail, marine, and pipeline
transport. Also, since the publication of the SAR, the IPCC has
released a comprehensive report on the impacts of aviation on
the global atmosphere (Penner et al., 1999) that includes a pro-
jection of expected progress in reducing energy intensity and
GHG emissions from commercial air transport, and adds great-
ly to the information about aviation’s effects on climate.

"The growth of transport energy use, its continued reliance on
petroleum and the consequent increases in carbon emissions are
driven by the long-term trends of increasing motorization of
world transport systems and ever-growing demand for mobili-
ty. Immediately after World War II, the world’s motor vehicle
fleet numbered 46 million vehicles, and 75% of the world’s cars
and trucks were in the USA. In 1996, there were 671 million
highway vehicles worldwide, and the US share stood at just
over 30% (Figure 3.7). Since 1970, the US motor vehicle pop-
ulation has been growing at an average rate of 2.5% per year,
but the population of vehicles in the rest of the world has been
increasing almost twice as rapidly at 4.8% per year (AAMA,
1998, p. 8). The same patterns of growth are discernible in sta-
tistics on vehicle stocks (ECMT, 1998).

global warming potential produced by the sector. Nitrous
oxide produced by vehicles equipped with catalytic convert-
ers, and methane emitted by internal combustion engines

comes from petroleum fuels. Between 1973 and 1996, world
transportation energy use, of which petroleum-derived fuels
comprise over 95%, increased by 66% (Figure 3.5).
Alternative energy sources have not played a significant role
in the world’s transport systems. Despite two decades of price
upheavals in world oil markets, considerable research and
development of alternative fuel technologies, and notable
attempts to promote alternative fuels through tax subsidies and
other policies, petroleum’s share of transport energy use has
not decreased (94.7% in 1973 and 96.0% in 1996) according
to IEA statistics (IEA, 1999c).

"Transport achieved major energy efficiency gains in the 1970s
and 1980s, partly because of an economic response to the oil
price increases of 1973 to 1974 and 1979 to 1980, and partly
as a result of government policies inspired by the oil price
shocks. Driven principally by mandatory standards, the aver-
age fuel economy of new passenger cars doubled in the USA
between 1974 and 1984 (e.g., Greene, 1998). In Europe, sim-
ilar improvements were achieved by a combination of volun-
tary efficiency agreements and higher taxes on motor fuels.
From 1980 to 1995 the average sales-weighted fuel consump-
tion rates of passenger cars sold in Europe and Japan fell by
12%, from 8.3 1/100km to 7.3 1/100km (Perkins, 1998). All of
the decrease, however, occurred between 1980 and 1985
(Figure 3.8). Since 1985, the fuel economies of light-duty
vehicles sold in the USA and Europe have remained essential-
ly constant.

"Mass reduction via materials substitution is a potentially
important strategy for improving light-duty vehicle fuel econ-
omy, because it permits synergistic reductions in engine size
without loss of performance. The use of alternative materials
to reduce weight has been historically restrained by cost con-
siderations, manufacturing process technology barriers, and
difficulty in meeting automotive requirements for surface fin-
ish quality, predictable behaviour during crash tests, or
repairability. The past few years have seen significant develop-
ments in space frame structures, advanced new manufacturing
technology for plastics and aluminium, and improved model-
ling techniques for evaluating deformability and crash proper-
ties. Ford has displayed an advanced lightweight prototype that
is a mid-size car with a weight of only 900 kg, as compared to
vehicles weighing 1450 kg today. Even if some of the more
exotic weight-saving materials from Ford’s prototype were dis-
carded, a weight reduction of 30% or more appears possible.
With engine downsizing to maintain a constant ratio of kW/kg,

"A hybrid electric vehicle combines an internal combustion
engine or other fuelled power source with an electric drivetrain
and battery (or other electrical storage device, e.g., an ultraca-
pacitor). Potential efficiency gains involve: (1) recapture of
braking energy (with the motor used as generator and captured
electricity stored in the battery); (2) potential to downsize the
engine, using the motor/battery as power booster; (3) potential
to avoid idling losses by turning off the engine or storing
unused power in the battery; and (4) increasing average engine
efficiency by using the storage and power capacity of the elec-
tric drivetrain to keep engine operation away from low effi-
ciency modes. Toyota recently introduced a sophisticated
hybrid subcompact auto, the Prius, in Japan and has since
introduced a version into the US market. Honda also began
selling in model year 2000 its Insight hybrid, a two seater.
Ford, GM, Daimler/Chrysler and several others have hybrids in
advanced development. The most fuel-efficient hybrid designs
can boost fuel economy by as much as 50% at near-constant
performance under average driving conditions. The added
complexity of the dual powertrain adds significantly to the cost
of hybrids, and this could hinder their initial market penetration
in countries with low fuel prices, unless policies are adopted to
promote them.

"According to Bouwman and Moll (1999), 85% of life cycle
vehicle energy use occurs in the vehicle use phase, with about
15% accounted for in vehicle production and about 3% recov-
ered in recycling. Mass reductions of 30% to 40% via exten-
sive substitution of aluminium for steel have been incorporat-
ed in the designs of advanced, high fuel economy prototypes,
improving fuel economy by 20% to 25%. Because the pro-
duction of aluminium requires more energy than production of
steel, and the recycling of aluminium auto bodies is more dif-
ficult given current recycling technology, the benefits of sub-
stituting aluminium for steel must be assessed by a life cycle
analysis of greenhouse gas emissions (efforts are being made
to improve aluminium recycling technology, however).
Analyses have shown that accounting for life cycle impacts
diminishes, but does not eliminate GHG emission reductions
caused by the use of aluminium for mass reduction in motor
vehicles (Figure 3.9). The amount of reduction, however, is
sensitive to several key assumptions. Considering the total life
cycle emissions for a typical passenger car in the USA, Das
(2000) concluded that higher net emissions in the production
plus recycling stages would reduce the potential GHG benefits
of aluminium in the vehicle use stage by 6.5% versus conven-
tional steel auto bodies, but by 15.8% versus advanced, ultra-
light steel body (ULSAB) designs.

"Direct injection (DI) diesel engines have long been available for
heavy trucks, but recently have become more competitive for
automobiles and light trucks as noise and emission problems
have been resolved. These new engines attain about 35% greater
fuel economy than conventional gasoline engines and produce
about 25% less carbon emissions over the fuel cycle. In light-
duty applications, DI diesels may cost US$500 to US$1000
more than a comparable gasoline engine. Tightening of NO, and
particulate emissions standards presents a challenge to the via-

"Fuel cells, which have the potential to achieve twice the ener-
gy conversion efficiency of conventional internal combustion
engines with essentially zero pollutant emissions, have
received considerable attention recently, with most major man-
ufacturers announcing their intentions to introduce such vehi-
cles by the 2005 model year. The recent optimism about the
fuel cell has been driven by strong advances in technology per-
formance, including rapid increases in specific power that now
allow a fuel cell powertrain to fit into a conventional vehicle
without sacrificing its passenger or cargo capacities. While fuel
cell costs have been reduced by approximately an order of
magnitude, they are still nearly 10 times as expensive per kW
as spark ignition engines. Recent analyses project that costs
below US$40/kW for complete fuel cell drivetrains powered
by hydrogen can be achieved over the next ten years (Thomas
et al., 1998). Hydrogen is clearly the cleanest and most effi-
cient fuel choice for fuel cells, but there is no hydrogen infra-
structure and on-board storage still presents technical and eco-
nomic challenges. Gasoline, methanol or ethanol are possible
alternatives, but require on-board reforming with consequent
cost and efficiency penalties. Mid-size fuel cell passenger cars
using hydrogen could achieve fuel consumption rates of 2.5
gasoline equivalent 1/100 km in vehicles with lightweight, low
drag bodies; comparable estimates for methanol or gasoline-
powered fuel cell vehicles would be 3.2 and 4.0 1/100 km
(gasoline equivalent), respectively. While gasoline is relative-
ly more difficult to reform, it has the benefit of an in-place
refuelling infrastructure, and progress has been made in
reformer technology (NRC, 1999a).

be 75% to 250% greater than that of conventional gasoline

125%. The GHG reduction potential of hydrogen or methanol
fuel cells, however, requires a “well-to-wheels” analysis to
measure the full fuel cycle impacts. Both sources cited here
include emissions of all significant greenhouse gases produced
in the respective processes. Assuming hydrogen produced by
local reforming of natural gas, Thomas ef al. (1998, Figure 8)
estimated roughly a 40% reduction in well-to-wheels GHG
emissions for a direct hydrogen fuel cell vehicle versus a con-

produced at the refuelling station by reforming natural gas,
would reduce full fuel cycle GHG emissions by 55% to 60%
versus a comparably sized 9.8 1/100km gasoline vehicle.
Hydrogen could also be produced from methane in large-scale
centralized facilities. This could create opportunities for
sequestering carbon but would also require an infrastructure

the grid-connected hybrid does no better because of the large

parking area controls) with advanced road traffic management
strategies, environmental protection strategies (such as tighter
pollutant emissions regulations and fuel economy standards),
and pricing mechanisms (such as motor fuel taxes, parking

related CO, emissions were projected to increase by about one-
third in OECD countries over the next 20 years and by twice

added significant investment in transit, pedestrian, and bicycle
infrastructure to shape land use along with stricter controls on

calming, promotion of clean fuels and the setting of air quality
goals for cities, as well as congestion pricing for roads and user
subsidies for transit. The addition of this strand was projected

pricing for motor vehicles (estimated at 5% of GDP in OECD
countries), and ensuring the use of high-efficiency, low-weight,
low-polluting cars, vans, lorries, and buses in cities. Addition

mated to be no cost to low-cost options. Bose (1999a) notes
that in developing countries mass transport modes and demand
management strategies are an essential complement to techno-
logical solutions because of three factors: (1) lack of leverage
in global vehicle markets to influence the development of
appropriate transport technologies; (2) the relatively greater
importance of older, more polluting vehicles combined with
slower stock turnover; and (3) the inability to keep pace with
rapid motorization in the provision of infrastructure.

25% over the next 10 years. The European standards will
require reducing average fuel consumption of new cars from

1995 new gasoline car fuel economy in 1/km by 2010, and a
13.2% improvement for gasoline light-duty freight vehicles

requirements are 14.9% and 6.5% by 2005. Technological
improvements in other modes are expected to produce efficien-

"An Asian four-country study of the technological and econom-
ic potential to reduce GHG emissions considered five types of
options for GHG mitigation in transport: (1) improving fuel
efficiency, (2) improving transportation system efficiency, (3)
behavioural change, (4) modal split changes, and (5) techno-
logical change (Bose, 1999b). The Indian study concluded that
abatement costs for transport were high relative to options
available in other sectors, and projected little change in trans-
port for emissions constraints less than a 20% reduction from
the baseline. The Bangladesh study, using a different method-
ology, concluded that a wide array of near-term technology
options had no net cost, but that the cost of 4-stroke engines for
3-wheeled vehicles fell between US$48 and US$334/tC
reduced, depending on the application. The Thailand study
found that lean-burn engines would improve efficiency by 20%
at a negative net cost of US$509/tC. The Korean study also
concluded that several “no regrets” options were available,
including use of continuously variable transmissions, lean-
burn engines, and exclusive bus lanes.

(DOE’s) National Laboratories (Interlaboratory Working
Group, 1997) assessed the economic market potential for car-
bon reductions, using the EJA’s National Energy Modelling
System. Transport carbon emissions were projected to rise
from 487 MtC in 1997 to 616 MtC by 2010 in the baseline
case. In comparison to the baseline case, use of cost-effective
technologies reduced carbon emissions by 12% in 2010 in an
“Efficiency” case (Table 3.13). More optimistic assumptions
about the success of R&D produced a reduction of 17% by
2010. The authors noted that lead times for cost-effectively
expanding manufacturing capacity for new technologies and
the normal turnover of the stock of transport equipment signif-
icantly limited what could be achieved by 2010. Efficiency
improvements in 2010 for new transportation equipment were
substantially greater (Table 3.14). New passenger car efficien-

proven technologies over a 10-year period. The two most pes-
simistic (which reflect a 1990 industry view of short-term tech-
nology potential) indicate that even a reduction from 8.4 to 6.5
1/100 km would cost nearly US$2000. The curves labelled
“ACEEE Level 3” and “UK DOT Low-Cost” are limited to
proven technologies, but allow substantial trade-offs in perfor-
mance, transmission-management and other features that may
affect customer satisfaction. The curves labelled “5S-lab” and
“OTA 2015” include the benefits of technologies in develop-
ment, but not yet commercialized (NRC, 1992; DeCicco and
Ross, 1993; US DOE/EIA, 1998). The most optimistic of these
suggest that an improvement to less than 5.9 1/100 km is pos-
sible at an incremental cost of less than US$1000 per vehicle
(1998 US$). The Sierra Research (Austin et al., 1999) curve is
intended to pertain to the year 2020, but reflects industry views
about technology performance, and excludes certain key tech-

dramatic impacts over the next 20 years.

"Three European studies of the technical-economic potential for
energy savings and CO, reduction were reviewed by van Wee
and Annema (1999). Generally, the studies focused on techno-
logical options, such as improving the fuel efficiencies of con-
ventional cars and trucks, promotion of hybrid vehicles,
switching trucks and buses to natural gas, and electrifying
buses, delivery trucks, and mopeds. Only the study for
Hanover included investment in improved public transport as a
major policy option. The results, summarized in Table 3.15,
suggest that emissions reductions of 8% to as much as 42%
over business-as-usual projections may be possible.

"jections are attainable, it is probably not practical to reduce
transport emissions below 1990 levels by the 2010-2015 time
period. On the other hand, the studies reviewed generally indi-
cate that cost-effective reductions on the order of 10%—20%
versus baseline appear to be achievable. In addition, more
rapid than expected advances in key technologies such as
hybrid and fuel cell vehicles, should they continue, hold out the
prospect of dramatic reductions in GHG emission from road
passenger vehicles beyond 2020. Most analyses project slower
rates of GHG reductions for freight and air passenger modes,
to a large extent reflecting expectations of faster rates of
growth in activity.

"Over the past 25 years, transport activity has grown at approx-
imately twice the rate of energy efficiency improvements.
Because the world’s transportation system continued to rely
overwhelmingly on petroleum as an energy source, transport
energy use and GHG emissions grew in excess of 2% per year.
Projections to 2010 and beyond reviewed above reflect the
belief that transport growth will continue to outpace efficiency
improvements and that without significant policy interven-
tions, global transport GHG emissions will be 50%-100%
greater in 2020 than in 1995. Largely as a result of this antici-
pated growth, studies of the technical and economic potential
for reducing GHG emissions from transport generally conclude

"The effects of a variety of fiscal and regulatory policies on CO,
emissions from road passenger vehicles have been estimated
for Europe over a 15-year forecast horizon (Jansen and Denis,
1999; Denis and Koopman, 1998). These studies, both using
the EUCARS model developed for the European Commission,
concluded that CO, reductions on the order of 15% over a
baseline case could be achieved in the 2011 to 2015 time peri-
od at essentially zero welfare loss. Among the more effective
policies were fuel taxes based on carbon content, fuel con-
sumption standards requiring proportional increases for all
cars, and the combination of fuel-consumption based vehicle
sales taxes with a fuel tax. When reductions in external costs
and the benefit of raising public revenues are included in the
calculation of social welfare impacts, the feebate (a policy
combining subsidies for fuel efficient vehicles and taxes on
inefficient ones) and fuel tax policy combination was able to
achieve CO, reductions of 20% to 25% in the 2011 to 2015
time period at zero social cost (Jansen and Denis, 1999).

"Assessing the total global potential for reducing GHG emis-
sions from transportation is hindered by the relatively small
number of studies (especially for non-OECD countries) and by
the lack of consistency in methods and conventions across
studies. Not all studies shown in Table 3.16 cover the entire
transportation sector, even of the countries included in the
study. Most consider a limited set of policy options, (e.g., only
motor vehicle fuel economy improvement). In general, the
studies do not report marginal costs of GHG mitigation, but
rather average costs versus a base case. Keeping all of these
limitations in mind, Table 3.16 summarizes the findings of sev-
eral major studies. For 2010, the average low GHG reduction
estimate is just under 7% of baseline total transport sector
emissions in 2010, with the higher estimates averaging a 17%
reduction. There is, however, considerable dispersion around
both numbers, indicative both of uncertainty and differences in
methodology and assumptions. For studies looking ahead to
2020, the average low estimate is 15% and the average high
estimate is 34% of baseline 2020 transport sector emissions.
Estimated (average rather than marginal) costs are generally
negative (as much as -US$200/tC), indicating that fuel savings
are expected to outweigh incremental costs. There are some
positive cost estimates as high as US$200/tC, however. The
majority of the studies cited in Table 3.16 are based on engi-
neering-economic analyses. Some argue that this method tends
to underestimate welfare costs because trade-offs between CO,
mitigation and non-price attributes (e.g., performance, com-
fort, reliability) are rarely explicitly considered (Sierra
Research, Inc., 1999).

amounted to 1,250MtC. A breakdown of 1990/1995 emissions
is given in Table 3.17. However, these emissions are only the
direct emissions, related to industrial fuel consumption. The
indirect emissions in 1990, caused by industrial electricity con-

> Total N,O emissions are estimated to be 489 ktonnes (65MtC,,) (Olivier er al., 1999). Main industrial process that lead to emissions of N,O are the productio
of adipic acid (38 MtC,,) and nitric acid (23 MtC,,).

At present, the main HFC source from industrial processes is the emission of HFC-23 (trifluoromethane, with an estimated GWP of 11,700) as an unintende;

by-product of HCFC-22 (chlorodifluoromethane) production. The weight percentage by-product is estimated to be 4%, 3%-5% (March Consulting, 1998) o
1.5%-3% (Branscome and Irving, 1999) of the HCFC-22 production. Some abatement takes place, but the fraction for 1995 is not known. Atmospheric mea
surements of HFC-23 suggest an emitted by-product fraction of 2.1% (Oram et al., 1998). This leads to the reported 22MtC,, These are not inconsistent wit

Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) have the general chemical formula C,F,,,,.The manufacturing industry is thought to be responsible for all PFC emissions, main]
CF, and C,F,. On the basis of recent atmospheric concentration data, Harnisch (1998) estimates emissions of 10,500 tonnes and 2000 per year respectivel
(20 MtC,,). Most of these emissions are the by-product of aluminium smelting; a smaller but growing contribution is from plasma etching in semi-conducte
manufacturing and use as solvent 1.4 - 4 Mtc,, (Victor and McDonald, 1999; Harnisch ef al, 1998). Some applications for higher carbon PFCs have also bee
identified and may become significant. C,F, (4M...) is emitted as a result of various activities, like plasma etching, fire extinguishers and as an additive t
the refrigerant R-413a. Emissions of c-C,F, (AMC) may result from the pyrolysis of fluoropolymers, whereas C,F,, originates from use of this substance a
a solvent (5 Mtc,,) (Harnisch et al., 1998; Harnisch, 2000). Regional breakdown is based on Victor and McDonald (1999) and is only for CF, and C,F,.
Maiss and Brenninkmeijer (1998) estimate the following breakdown of 1995 emissions (in tonnes SF,): switchgear manufacturers: 902; utilities and acceler

ators: 3476; magnesium industry: 437; electronics industry: 327; “using adiabatic properties”: 390; other uses: 498; total 6076. The regional breakdown i

"A substantial part of industrial greenhouse gas emissions is
related to the production of a number of primary materials.
Relevant to this is the concept of dematerialization (the reduc-
tion of society’s material use per unit of GDP). For most indi-
vidual materials and many countries dematerialization can be
observed. Cleveland and Ruth (1999) reviewed a range of stud-
ies that show this. They suggest that it cannot be concluded to
be due to an overall decoupling of economy and material
inputs, among other reasons because of the inability to measure
aggregate material use. Furthermore, they note that some ana-
lysts observe relinking of economic growth and material use in
more recent years. They warn against “gut” feeling that techni-
cal change, substitution, and a shift to the “information age”
inexorably lead to decreased materials intensity and reduced
environmental impact.

"Unander et al. (1999) have analysed the underlying factors for
the development of energy consumption in OECD countries in
the period 1990 to 1994. Generally, the development of energy
use can be broken down into three factors: volume, structure
and energy efficiency. In the period examined, development of
production volume differed from country to country, ranging
from a 2.0% growth per annum in Norway to a 1.4% per
annum decline in Germany. The second factor is structure: this
is determined by the shares that the various sectors have in the
total industrial production volume. A quite remarkable result is
that in nearly all countries, structural change within the manu-
facturing industry has an increasing effect on energy use, i.e.
there is a shift towards more energy-intensive industrial sec-
tors. This is a contrast with earlier periods. Finally, Unander et
al. (1999) found — with some exceptions — a continuing decline
in energy intensity within sectors, be it at a lower pace than in
the period 1973 to 1986. For more results see Table 3.18.

Especially options for light industry are not worked out in

Nevertheless, there are in relative terms probably more sub-
stantial savings possible than in heavy industry (see, e.g., De

energy consumption may stabilize at 1990 levels. The differ-

MtC. Of this reduction approx. 30% could be realized in
OECD countries; approx. 20% in economies-in-transition, and
approximately 50% in developing countries. The high share for

improvement was undertaken by the World Energy Council

cient technologies available; in that case industrial primary
energy requirement is limited to 173EJ in 2020. Finally, the

in the year 2010 (see Table 3.19), their full implementation
may take some decades. De Beer (1998) carried out an in-depth
analysis for three sectors (paper, steel and ammonia). He con-

"In heavy industry most of the energy is used to produce a lim-
ited number of primary materials, like steel, cement, plastic,
paper, etc. Apart from process changes that directly reduce the
CO, emissions of the processes, also the limitation of the use
of these primary materials can help in reducing CO, emissions
of these processes. A range of options is available: material
efficient product design (Brezet and van Hemel, 1997); mater-
ial substitution; product recycling; material recycling; quality
cascading; and good housekeeping (Worrell et al., 1995b). A
review of such options is given in a report for the UN (1997).

"However, there are a number of sectors where cheaper recov-
ery is possible. These typically are processes where hydrogen
is produced from fossil fuels, leaving CO, as a by-product.
This is the case in ammonia production (note that some of the
CO, is already utilized), and increasingly in refineries. Costs
can be limited to those of purification, drying and compression.
They can be on the order of about US$30/tC avoided (Farla et
al., 1995). Another example of carbon dioxide recovery con-
nected to a specific process is the recovery of CO, from the
calcination of sodium bicarbonate in soda ash production. The
company Botash in Botswana recovers and reuses 70% of the
CO, generated this way (Zhou and Landner, 1999). There are
several industrial gas streams with a high CO, content from
which carbon dioxide recovery theoretically is more efficient
than from flue gas (Radgen, 1999). However, there are no
technical solutions yet to realize this (Farla et al., 1995).

"In general not much attention is paid to fuel switching in the
manufacturing industry. Fuel choice to a large extent is sector
dependent (coal for dominant processes in the iron and steel
industry, oil products in large sectors in the chemical industry).
Nevertheless, there seems to be some potential. This may be
illustrated by the figures presented in Table 3.20 where — per
sector — the average carbon intensity of fuels used in industry
is compared to the country with the lowest carbon intensity.
This indicates that fuel switching within fossil fuels can
reduce CO, emissions by 10%-20%. However, it is not clear
whether the switch is feasible in practical situations, or what
the costs are. However, there are specific options that combine
fuel switching with energy efficiency improvement. Examples
are: the replacement of oil- and coal-fired boilers by natural-
gas fired combined heat and power (CHP) plant; the replace-
ment of oil-based partial oxidation processes for ammonia pro-
duction by natural-gas based steam reforming; and the replace-
ment of coal-based blast furnaces for iron production by natur-
al-gas based direct reduction. Daniéls and Moll (1998) calcu-
late that costs of this option are high under European energy
price conditions. In the case of lower natural gas prices this
option may be more attractive.

"Closed-loop cement recycling is not yet technically possible
(UN, 1997). A more important option for reducing both ener-
gy-related and process emissions in the cement industry is the
use of blended cements, where clinker as input is replaced by,
e.g., blast furnace slag or fly ash from coal combustion. Taking
into account the regional availability of such inputs and maxi-
mum replacement, it is estimated that about 5%—20% of total
CO, emissions of the cement industry can be avoided. Costs of
these alternative materials are generally lower than those of
clinker IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme, 1999). Note
that these figures are based on a static analysis for the year

US$60/tN,O, which is less than USSINC,,. Costs of thermal
destruction in boilers are even lower. The inter-industry group
of five major adipic acid manufacturers worldwide in 1991 to
1993 have agreed on information exchange and on a substan-
tial emission cut before the year 2000. These major producers
probably will have reduced their joint emissions by 91%. It is

"Some integral approaches give an overview of the total possi-
ble impact of changes in the material system. Gielen (1999) has
modelled the total Western European materials and energy sys-
tem, using a linear optimization model (Markal). In a baseline
scenario emissions of greenhouse gases in the year 2030 are
projected to be 5000 Mc... At a cost of US$200/tC 10% of
these emissions can be avoided through “material options”; at
acost of US$800/tC this increases to 20%. Apart from “end-of-
pipe” options, especially material substitution is important,
e.g., replacement of petrochemical feedstocks by biomass
feedstocks (see also Chapter 4); steel by aluminium in the
transport sector; and concrete by wood in the buildings sector.
At higher costs, waste management options (energy recovery,
plastics recycling) are also selected by the model. Gielen
(1999) notes that in his analysis the effect of material efficien-
cy of product design is underestimated.

technically-feasible, low cost emission reduction options avail-
able for a number of applications. Since the SAR, implementa-
tion of major technological advances have led to significant
emission reductions of N,O and the fluorinated greenhouse
gases produced as unintended by-products. For the case of flu-
orinated gases being used as working fluids or process gases,
process changes, improved containment and recovery, and use
of alternative compounds and technologies have been adopted.
On-going research and development efforts are expected to
further expand emission reduction options. Energy efficiency
improvements are also being achieved in some refrigeration
and foam insulation applications, which use fluorinated gases.
Emission reduction options by sector are highlighted below.

"Through the World Semiconductor Council, semiconductor
manufacturers in the EU, Japan, Korea, Taiwan (China), and
the USA have set a voluntary emission reduction target to
lower PFC emissions by at least 10% by 2010 from 1995 (1997
for Korea and 1997/1999 average for Taiwan (China) baselines

"Baseline processes consume from 15%-60% of influent PFCs
depending on the chemical used and the process application
(etch or CVD). PFC emissions, however, vary depending on a
number of factors: gas used, type/brand of equipment used,
company-specific process parameters, number of PFC-using
steps in a production process, generation of PFC by-product
chemicals, and whether abatement equipment has been imple-
mented. Semiconductor product types, manufacturing process-
es, and, consequently, emissions vary significantly across
worldwide semiconductor fabrication facilities.

"The semiconductor industry uses HFC-23, CF,, C,F,, C3F, c-
C,F,, SF, and NF, in two production processes: plasma etch-
ing thin films (etch) and plasma cleaning chemical vapour
deposition (CVD) tool chambers. These chemicals are critical
to current manufacturing methods because they possess unique
characteristics when used in a plasma that currently cannot be
duplicated by alternatives. The industry’s technical reliance on
high GWP chemicals is increasing as a consequence of grow-
ing demand for semiconductor devices (15% average annual
growth), and ever-increasing complexity of semiconductor
devices.
"	Text
"PFC use by the semiconductor industry began in the early
1990s. Global emissions from semiconductor manufacturing
have been estimated at 4 Mc, in 1995 (Harnisch et al., 1998).
Options for reducing PFC emissions from semiconductor man-
ufacture include process optimization, alternative chemicals,
recovery and/or recycling, and effluent abatement. A number
of emission reduction options are now commercially available.
For plasma-enhanced CVD chamber cleans, switching to PFCs
that are more fully dissociated in the plasma or installing reac-
tive fluorine generators upstream of the chamber is favoured.
For etch tools, PFC abatement is currently available (Worth,
2000). However, the size of wafers being processed and the
design and age of the fabrication facility have a major impact
on the applicability of PFC emission reduction technology. A
recent study for the EU (Harnisch and Hendriks, 2000) esti-
mated that 60% of projected emissions from this sector could
be abated through the use of NF, in chamber cleaning at
USSILOAC,,. According to the same study another 10% are
available through alternative etch chemistry at no costs and
about 20% through oxidation of exhausts from etch chambers
at US$330/C,,. The remaining emissions from existing sys-
tems are assumed to be currently virtually unabatable.

"The smelting process entails electrolytic reduction of alumina
(A1,O,) to produce aluminium (Al). The smelter pot contains
alumina dissolved in an electrolyte, which mainly consists of
molten cryolite (Na,AIF,). Normal smelting is interrupted by
an “anode effect” that is triggered when alumina concentra-
tions drop; excess voltages between the anode and alumina
bath result in the formation of PFCs (CF, and C,F,) from car-
bon in the anode and fluorine in the cryolite (Huglen and
Kvande, 1994; Cook, 1995; Kimmerle and Potvin, 1997).
Several processes for primary aluminium production are in
use, with specific emissions ranging from typically 0.15 to
1.34 kg CF, per tonne Al!® depending on type of technology
(determined by anode type and alumina feeding technology)
(IAI, 2000). Measurements made at smelters with the best
available technology (point feed prebake) indicate an emis-
sions rate as low as 0.006 kg CF, per tonne Al (Marks er al.,
2000). Worldwide average emissions for 1995 are estimated to
range from 0.26 to 0.77 kg CF, per tonne Al (Harnisch er al.,
1998; IEA, 2000). Manufacturers have carried out two surveys
on the occurrence of anode effects and associated PFC-emis-
sions (IPAI, 1996; IAI, 2000). Based on 60% coverage of
world production (no data on Russia and China) they estimat-
ed a mean emission value of 0.3 kg CF, per tonne Al in 1997.
Emission reductions were achieved from 1990 to 1995 by con-
version to newer technologies, retrofitting existing plants, and
improved plant operation. Industry-government partnerships
also played a significant role in reducing PFC emissions. As of
November 1998, 10 countries (which accounted for 50% of
global aluminium production in 1998) have undertaken indus-
try-government initiatives to reduce PFC emissions from pri-
mary aluminium production (US EPA, 1999d). It has been esti-
mated that emissions could be further reduced via equipment
retrofits, such as the addition or improvement of computer con-
trol systems (a minor retrofit) and the conversion to point-feed
systems (a major retrofit). One study estimated 1995 emis-
sions could be reduced an additional 10%—50% (depending on
technology type and region) with maximum costs ranging from
USS$HOACO,,, for a minor retrofit to nearly US$100/CO,.,
for a major retrofit (IEA, 2000). A second study estimates that
1995 emissions could be reduced by 40% at costs lower than
US$30/C,,, by 65% at costs lower than USS1LO0/C,, and by
85% at costs lower than US$300/C,, (Harnisch et al., 1998;
15% discount rate, 10 year amortization).

"Significant emissions may also occur during the manufacturing

repeatedly filled with SF, and re-evacuated (Harnisch and

help to reduce these emissions down to at least 10% of the total
charge of SF,.

are about 20 HCFC-22 plants globally. Additional new plants
are expected in developing countries as CFC production plants
are converted to comply with the Montreal Protocol and
demand for refrigeration grows. Although HCFC-22 is an
ozone-depleting chemical and production for commercial use
will be phased out between 2005 and 2040, production as a

"SF, is used for electrical insulation, arc quenching, and current
interruption in electrical equipment used in the transmission
and distribution of high-voltage electricity. SF, has physical
properties that make it ideal for use in high-voltage electric
power equipment, including high dielectric strength, excellent
arc quenching properties, low chemical reactivity, and good
heat transfer characteristics. The high dielectric strength of SF,
allows SF,-insulated equipment to be more compact than
equivalent air-insulated equipment. An SF,-insulated substa-
tion can require as little as 10% of the volume of an air-insu-
lated substation. Most of the SF, used in electrical equipment
is used in gas-insulated switch gear and circuit breakers. SF, in
electric equipment is the largest use category of SF, with glob-
al estimates of over 75% of SF, sales going to electric power
applications (SPS, 1997). Options to reduce emissions include
upgrading equipment with low emission technology, and
improved handling during installation maintenance

"In the magnesium industry, a dilute mixture of SF, with dry air
and/or CO, is used as a protective cover gas to prevent violent
oxidation of the molten metal. It is assumed that all SF, used is
emitted to the atmosphere. 7% of global SF, sales is estimated
to be for magnesium applications (SPS, 1997). Manufacturing
segments include primary magnesium production, die casting,
gravity casting and secondary production (i.e., scrap metal recy-
cling). Because of differing production processes and plant
scale, emission reduction potential varies across manufacturing
segments. Emissions of SF, in magnesium casting can poten-
tially be reduced to zero by switching to SO, a highly toxic and
corrosive chemical used over20 years ago as a protective cover
gas. Harnisch and Hendriks (2000) estimate that net costs of
switching from SF, to SO,-based cover gas systems are about
USSIAC,,, but as a result of the high toxicity and corrosivity of
SO, much more careful handling and gas management is
required. In many cases the specific usage of SF, can be reduced
by operational changes, including moderate technical modifica-
tions (Maiss and Brenninkmeijer, 1998). Companies may also
reduce SF, emissions and save money by carefully managing
the concentration and application of the cover gas (IMA, 1998).
A study is currently beingundertaken to identify and evaluate
chemical alternatives to SF, and SO, for magnesium melt pro-
tection (Clow and Hillls, 2000).

"Industry is responsible for 75% of commercial energy end-use in
China (IEA, 1997d). The period from 1980 to 1996 has seen a
strong economic growth and growth of industrial production,
but also a substantial decline of the energy/GDP ratio of about
4% per year (China Statistical Yearbook). The share of energy
efficiency and structural change in this decline is uncertain, but
it is clear that substantial energy efficiency improvement was
obtained (Zhou and Hu, 1999; Sinton, 1996). Nevertheless,
Chinese industry is still substantially less energy efficient than
most OECD countries (Wu and Wei, 1997), see also Figure 3.13.
Within industry, the steel industry is most important, consuming
23% of industrial energy use in 1995 (IEA, 1997d). Zhou and
Hu (1999) analysed the differences between the Chinese and the
efficient Japanese iron and steel industry and identified a range
of measures to improve the specific energy consumption of the
Chinese steel industry. Important measures are the recovery of
residual gases (2.7GJ/t steel); boiler modification and CHP (2.1
GJ/t); improved feedstock quality (2.1GJ/t); wider application
of continuous casting (1.0GJ/t); and others (2.0GJ/t). The total

"leads to a reduction of 25% compared to the present average of
35.6GJ/t (Zhou and Hu, 1999). An analysis of future prospects
by Worrell (1995) shows that, in the case steel production grows
from 93Mt in 1995 to 140Mt in 2020, energy consumption in the
Chinese steel industry is likely to grow. But the growth can be
very moderate if modern technologies, like smelt reduction and
near-net-shape casting, are adopted. Also for two other impor-
tant sectors, the building materials industry and the chemical
industries, substantial technical saving potentials are reported
(Zhou and Hu, 1999). Liu er al. (1995) report for the cement
industry — consuming 10% of industrial energy use in 1995 —a
potential for reduction of the specific energy consumption of
32% in the period 1990 to 2000; associated investments are esti-
mated at 105 billion yuan (~US$13 billion). Important econom-
ically viable options are comprehensive retrofit of vertical kilns
(e.g., improving refractory lining) and wet kilns, and kiln diam-
eter enlargement and retrofit. Similar savings can be reached
when adding a pre-calciner to the kilns, which is, however, the
most expensive option. All cost-effective measures add up to a
20% reduction of primary energy consumption compared to the
base line energy use in 2010 (Sinton and Yang, 1998).

"In developing countries such as India, emissions mainly arise
from ruminant methane, field burning of agricultural residues,

research into more frequent draining of paddy fields, reduction
in the use of nitrogenous fertilizers, and improved diets of cat-
tle is ongoing. Cattle numbers are expected to increase 50% by
2020, which would largely offset any methane avoidance.

results from the manufacturing of other essential inputs such as
machinery, inorganic fertilizers, and agrio-chemicals.

"A category of options to which only limited attention was paid
in relation to greenhouse gas emission reduction is material effi-

tials exist. These may be sufficient to attain emission reductions
on the order of 600MtC in the year 2020 (UN, 1997). However,
a significant effort is needed in selection, development, and
implementation of such options. For the shorter term the poten-

complexity of introducing these options.

"As for energy inputs, in many developing countries traditional
agriculture still depends on human labour and animal power
together with firewood for cooking. Modern agriculture in
industrialized countries relies on direct fossil fuel inputs
together with embedded energy in fertilizers, and for transport

transported an average of over 2500km (Resources for the
Future, 1998) and even further in Europe and Australasia.

assumed to lead to a reduction of specific energy use by
0.5%-—1.0% per year (assumption for the average: 0.75%). The

industrial energy efficiency improvement, it is assumed that
from the year 2000 the enhanced energy efficiency improve-
ment is 1.5%—2.0% per year in the OECD countries (average);
and 2%-2.5% per year in the other world regions. Starting
from the energy use and emission figures quoted in section

2010 and 700-900MtC for the year 2020. These figures are

"It once again becomes clear that enhanced energy efficiency
improvement remains the main option for emission reduction
in the manufacturing industry. There are substantial differences
in the level of energy efficiency between countries and also
potentials differ. For most OECD countries and for a number
of developing countries extended inventories of emission
reduction options in industry exist. However, the focus is still
very much on the heavy industrial sector. The total potential of
energy efficiency improvement for the year 2010 can be esti-
mated to be 300-SOOMC for the year 2010. It seems possible
to develop new technologies to sustain energy efficiency
improvement in the longer term; if such innovations material-
ize the potential can be 700 - 900MtC for the year 2020. The
larger part of these emission reductions can be attained at net
negative costs.

terms of reduced nutrient inputs, lower environmental impacts,
and with zero depletion of the world’s natural resources such
as fish and topsoil. This can only be successfully achieved if
practical support is received from primary producers, and this
will only occur if other benefits are perceived (Section 3.6.4.5).

"Spedding (1992) expounded the view that if abundant renew-
able energy supplies were to become available, then energy
would be the only important natural resource since all other
natural resources could be generated and all waste streams neu-
tralized. In theory even soil could be considered to be a dis-
pensable resource since crops could be grown hydroponically
in nutrient solutions, though in practice this would not be fea-
sible. Agricultural industries can contribute to a more sustain-
able energy future by providing biomass products. Surplus
crop and animal waste products (where not used for soil
amendments or fertilizers) can be used as bioenergy sources.
Growing crops for energy is well understood, though usually
only economically viable where some form of government
incentive exists or the environmental benefits are fully recog-
nized (Sims, 1997). Possible conflicts of land use for sustain-
able food production, soil nutrient depletion, water availabili-
ty, and biodiversity need to be addressed.

"Strategies for reducing methane emissions from paddy rice
and ruminant animals are being evaluated (Yagi et al., 1997),
as are techniques to reduce N,O emissions by better treatment
of wastes, improved pasture and animal management, and
improved use of nitrogenous fertilizers. Reducing N,O emis-
sions has to be achieved in areas of intensive agriculture by
reducing the N surplus of the system. Improvements in mod-
elling nitrogen and carbon fluxes for agricultural ecosystems
have recently been developed (see, for example, Li, 1998,
1999) and applied on the county level for the USA (Li 1995,
Li et al. 1996) and for China (Li et al., 1999). By considering
the specific interaction between agricultural management with
climate and soil conditions, the model simulations have
demonstrated large potentials for mitigating N,O and other
greenhouse gas emissions by changing management practices.
These include adjusting fertilizer use in poor or rich soils;
altering timing of fertilizer or manure applications based on
rainfalls; and altering timing and depth of tillage. Based on the
modelled results for the USA and China, the most effective
way to reduce agricultural N,O emissions and to ensure ade-
quate crop yields is to optimize fertilizer use in arable soils,
particularly those which contain soil organic carbon greater
than 3%. However, farmers will need to first accept this man-
agement practice if it is to be implemented. A full discussion
on the complexities of soil carbon is provided in the Special
Report on Land Use, Land Use Change, and Forestry (IPCC,

forests by burning and cultivation to provide more land for
agricultural production with subsequent soil degradation, are
also major contributors (Chapter 4). Carbon sequestration by
soils continues to be quantified and estimates refined further,
including the effects from reducing organic matter losses by

oilseed rape in Europe, are being commercially produced but
are subject to commodity price fluctuations and government

energy companies are paying farmers (through an insurance
company acting as an aggregator of credits),
CAN$1.50—13/ha/yr to change to zero tillage so they can claim
the resulting carbon credits for the effective accumulation peri-

higher carbon gains, and the extent to which other on-farm car-

"Liquid biofuels (see Section 3.4.4.6) when substituted for fos-

result in maximum benefit from mitigation strategies. This can
be achieved by planting energy crops such as short rotation
coppice into arable or pasture land, which increases the carbon
density of that land, while also yielding a source of biomass.
Converting the accumulated carbon in the biofuels for energy
purposes, and hence recycling it, alleviates the critical issue of
maintaining the biotic carbon stocks over time as for a forest
sink. Increased levels of soil carbon may also result from grow-
ing perennial energy crops (IEA Bioenergy, 1999), but a

be available if a sustainable and economic bioenergy industry

"Animal manures and industrial organic wastes are currently
used to generate biogas. For example, in Denmark there are 19
decentralized community scale biogas plants for electricity
generation (Nielsen et al., 1998). Biogas can also be used for
cogeneration, direct heating or as a transport fuel.

"Developing countries are slowly moving towards using mod-
ern food and fibre production techniques. Economies in transi-
tion are also implementing modern production methods
encouraged by foreign investors but many challenges remain.
From a sustainability point of view, traditional methods may
well be preferable.
"	Text
"Asummary of the technical and market potential for reducing
greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural industry is
given in Table 3.36. If agricultural production per hectare in
developing countries could be increased to meet the growing
food and fibre demand as a result of a greater uptake of new
farming techniques, modern technologies and improved man-
agement systems, then there would be less incentive for defor-
estation to provide more agricultural land.
"	Text
"Comparative regional studies of agricultural emissions per unit
of GDP or per hectare or per capita would show significant dif-
ferences but as a result of local farming systems, climate, and
management techniques employed, a useful comparison
between regions is not possible. Standard methods for measur-
ing and reporting of agricultural emissions are being developed
and will enable more accurate and useful comparisons to be
made between alternative production systems in the future
(Kroeze and Mosier, 1999).
"	Text
"Crop residues such as straw, bagasse, and rice husks, if not
returned to the land for nutrient replenishment and soil condi-
tioning, could be used more in the future for heat and power
generation, at times in co-combustion with coal, and in appro-
priate conversion equipment now that the technology is well
proven. Wood residues used in small-scale biomass gasifiers
will become reliable and more cost effective in time, but at pre-
sent have some operational risk attached, particularly under
developing country conditions (Senelwa and Sims, 1999).
"	Text
"Forest sinks are covered in Chapter 4 and also in the Special
Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (IPCC,
2000), but there is a link between these low cost sinks and
eventually using some of the biomass grown for energy pur-
poses. Once the limited area of available land is covered in
forest sinks, no more planting will be possible and recycling of
the carbon to displace fossil fuels may then become feasible.
Economic mechanisms to link a forest sink project with a bio-
fuel project have been suggested (Read, 1999).
"	Text
"Certain woody crops and also perennial grasses grown to pro-
duce biomass have theoretically high dry matter yields, but
commercial yields are often lower than expected from those
produced in small plot research trials. In Sweden, for example,
where 16,000 ha of coppice Salix species have been planted,
around 2000ha were harvested for the first time during the win-
ters of 1996 to 1998 to yield only 4.2 oven dry t/ha/yr on aver-
age (Larsson et al., 1998). With better management, genetic
selection, and grower experience once viable markets for the
product are established, it had been anticipated that commer-
cial yields closer to 10 oven dry t/ha/yr would result.
"	Text
"Correct species selection to meet specific soil and climatic site
conditions is necessary in order to maximize yields in terms of
MgJ/ha/yr (Sims et al., 1999). For example, the saccharose yield
of Brazilian sugar cane has increased 10% to 143kg/t of fresh
cane (70% moisture content wet basis) since 1990. Methods of
identifying appropriate species based on non-destructive yield
measurements and species fuelwood characteristics have been
developed (Senelwa and Sims, 1998). Energy balance ratios
for each unit of energy input required to produce solid fuels
from short rotation forest crops are up to 1: 30, and can be even
higher when crop residues are also utilized (Scholz, 1998).
Woody crops normally require less energy inputs per hectare
than food crops.
"	Text
"Many farmers in both developed and developing countries will
remain unlikely to change their traditional production methods
in the short term unless there are clear financial incentives to
do so. Behavioural changes as a result of advisors educating
members of farming communities to adopt new measures have
rarely succeeded to date. Cultural factors have a strong influ-
ence on the general unwillingness to accept inappropriate
development and hence new ideas. Changing attitudes are
unlikely to occur unless farmers can also perceive personal co-
benefits such as increased profitability, time saving, cost reduc-
tions, improved animal health, increased soil fertility, and less
arduous tasks. Regulations in some form are the alternative
(OECD, 1998a) but would probably be difficult to monitor,
particularly in developing countries. Education of local exten-
sion officers is needed to encourage the uptake of new methods
and more rapid implementation into the field. These barriers
are discussed in section 5.4.5.

"The life cycle environmental impact and GHG emissions from
recycling are usually higher than reusing products. This may
not hold true if the used materials have to be transported over
long distances. To address this issue, some countries such as
Germany, Norway, Denmark, and other European countries
have standardized bottles for local reuse.

"The major emphasis in the SAR was on the reduction of green-
house gases associated with industrial recycling in the metals,
glass and paper industries. These topics are addressed in the
industrial Section 3.5 of this chapter. There was a less system-
atic account of the methane emissions from landfills, or of the
consumer dimension of recycling, both of which will be
emphasized here.
"	Text
"Recycling involves the collection of materials during produc-
tion or at the end of a product’s useful lifetime for reuse in the
manufacturing process. The degree of treatment varies from
simple remelting of glass, aluminium, or steel, to the breaking
apart and reconstitution of paper or other fibres (e.g., textiles or
carpets), to depolymerization of plastics and synthetic fibres to
monomers, which are then used instead of petrochemicals to
synthesize new polymers.
"	Text
"landfills depending upon local conditions. However, there are
no plausible scenarios in which landfilling minimizes GHG
emissions from waste management. For yard waste, GHG
emissions are roughly comparable from landfilling and com-
posting; for food waste, composting yields significantly lower
emissions than landfilling. For paper waste, landfilling causes
higher GHG emissions than either recycling or incineration
with energy recovery (US EPA, 2000).
"	Text
"In many cases, manufacturing products from recycled materi-
als is less energy intensive and associated with fewer GHG
emissions than making products from virgin materials. This is
especially true for aluminium and steel, which are energy
intensive and release significant process GHGs during produc-
tion (CO, and PFCs). A US EPA analysis finds lower GHG
emissions over the product life cycle from recycling than from
virgin production and disposal of paper, metals, glass, and plas-
tics under typical American conditions (US EPA, 2000).
"	Text
"Worldwide, the dominant methods of waste disposal are land-
fills and open dumps. Although these disposal methods often
have lower first costs, they may contribute to serious local air
and water pollution, and release high GWP landfill gas (LFG).
LFG is generated when organic material decomposes anaero-
bically. It comprises approximately 50%-60% methane, 40%-
45% CO, and the traces of non-methane volatile organics and
halogenated organics. In 1995, US, landfill methane emissions
of 64 Mtc,, slightly exceed its agricultural sector methane
from livestock and manure.
"	Text
"Waste and waste management affect the release of greenhouse
gases in five major ways: (1) landfill emissions of methane; (2)
reductions in fossil fuel use by substituting energy recovery
from waste combustion; (3) reduction in energy consumption
and process gas releases in extractive and manufacturing
industries, as a result of recycling; (4) carbon sequestration in
forests, caused by decreased demand for virgin paper; and (5)
energy used in the transport of waste for disposal or recycling.
Except for the long-range transport of glass for reuse or recy-
cling, transport emissions of secondary materials are often one
or two orders of magnitude smaller than the other four factors
(Ackerman, 2000).
"	Text
"Methane emission from landfills varies considerably depend-
ing on the waste characteristics (composition, density, particle
size), moisture content, nutrients, microbes, temperature, and
pH (El-Fadel, 1998). Data from field studies conducted world-
wide indicate that landfill methane production may range over
six orders of magnitude (between 0.003-3000g/m?/day)
(Bogner et al,. 1995). Not all landfill methane is emitted into
the air; some is stored in the landfill and part is oxidized to
CO,. The IPCC theoretical approach for methane estimation
has been complemented with more recent, site-specific models
that take into account local conditions such as soil type, cli-
mate, and methane oxidation rates to calculate overall methane
emissions (Bogner et al,. 1998).
"	Text
"Overall energy consumption is lower for recycled paper than
for virgin paper, yet there is some debate over life cycle GHG
emissions between paper recycling (Blum ef al., 1997;
Finnveden and Thomas, 1998; US EPA, 1998) and paper con-
sumption with energy recovery (Bystroem and Loennstedt,
1997; Ruth and Harrington, 1998; ITED, 1996). These conflict-
ing analyses make different underlying assumptions concern-
ing the fuel displaced by energy released from paper incinera-
tion, the energy source for the electricity used in paper produc-
tion, how the recycled paper is utilized, and how much carbon
sequestration can be credited to uncut forests because of recy-
cling. In all studies, landfilling of paper clearly releases more
GHGs than either recycling or incineration.

"Waste-to-energy (WTE) plants create heat and electricity from
burning mixed solid waste. Because of high corrosion in the
boilers, the steam temperature in WTE plants is less than 400
degrees Celsius. As a result, total system efficiency of WTE
plants is only between 12%-24% (Faaij et al., 1998; US EPA,
1998; Swithenbank and Nasserzadeh, 1997).
"	Text
"For developing countries, the low cost and simplicity of com-
posting, and the high organic content of the waste stream make
small-scale composting a promising solution. Increased com-
posting of municipal waste can reduce waste management
costs and emissions, while creating employment and other
public health benefits.
"	Text
"Other studies have found that the methane yield from landfills
is about 60-170 I/kg of dry refuse (El-Fadel et al., 1998). Some
landfills produce electricity from LFG by installing cost effec-
tive gas turbines or technologically promising, but still expen-
sive fuel cells (Siuru, 1997). Later reports dispute this claim
(US EPA, 2000).
"	Text
"Anaerobic digestion to produce methane for fuel has been suc-
cessful on a variety of scales in developed and developing coun-
tries. The rural biogas programmes based upon manure and agri-
cultural waste in India and China are very extensive. In industri-
al countries, digestion at large facilities utilizes raw materials
including organic waste from agriculture, sewage sludge,
kitchens, slaughterhouses, and food processing industries.
"	Text
"Net GHG emissions from WTE facilities are usually low and
comparable to those from biomass energy systems, because
electricity and heat are generated largely from photosyntheti-
cally produced paper, yard waste, and organic garbage rather
than from fossil fuels. Only the combustion of fossil fuel based
waste such as plastics and synthetic fabrics contribute to net
GHG releases, but recycling of these materials generally pro-
duces even lower emissions.
"	Text
"Incineration is common in the industrialized regions of Europe,
Japan and the northeastern USA where space limitations, high
land costs, and political opposition to locating landfills in com-
munities limit land disposal. In developing countries, low land
and labour costs, the lack of high heat value materials such as
paper and plastic in the waste stream, and the high capital cost
of incinerators have discouraged waste combustion as an
option.

"for yard waste, and lower than landfilling for food waste. These
estimates do not include the benefits of the reduced need for
synthetic fertilizer, which is associated with large CO, emis-
sions during manufacture and transport, and N,O releases dur-
ing use. USDA research indicates that compost usage can
reduce fertilizer requirements by at least 20% (Ligon, 1999),
thereby significantly reducing net GHG emissions (see Section
3.6).

"Methane emissions from domestic and industrial wastewater
disposal contribute about 10% of global anthropogenic
methane sources (30-40Mt annually). Industrial wastewater,
mainly from pulp and paper and food processing industries,
contributes more than 90% of these emissions, whereas domes-
tic and commercial wastewater disposal contributes about 2 Mt
annually. Unlike methane emissions from solid waste, most of
the methane from wastewater is believed to be generated in
non-Annex I countries, where wastewater is often untreated
and stored under anaerobic conditions (SAR).
"	Text
"LFG capture and energy recovery is a frequently applied landfill
management practice. There have been many initiatives during
the past few years to capture and utilize LFG in gas turbines; a
number of such facilities are currently generating electricity. US
regulations now require capture of an average of 40% of all
landfill methane nationwide. Yet even after compliance with
those regulations, it remains profitable (at a carbon price of zero
or negative cost) to capture 52% of the landfill methane. At a
price of US$20AC,, (in 1996 dollars), an additional 19% of the
methane could be captured, an amount that approaches the esti-
mated maximum practical attainable level (US EPA, 1999a).
Official estimates suggest that approximately half, or 35MtC,,,
of landfill methane could be recovered by 2000.
"	Text
"Composting of yard waste has become widespread in many
developed countries, and some communities compost food
waste as well. Small, low-technology facilities handling only
yard waste are inexpensive and generally problem-free. Some
European and North American cities have encountered diffi-
culties implementing large-scale, mixed domestic, commercial
and industrial bio-waste collection and composting schemes.
The problems range from odour complaints to heavy metal
contamination of the decomposed residue. Also, large-scale
composting requires mechanical aeration which can be energy
intensive (40-70 kW/t of waste) (Faaij et al., 1998). However,
facilities that combine anaerobic and aerobic digestion are able
to provide this energy from self-supplied methane. If 25% or
more of the waste is digested anaerobically the system can be
self-sufficient (Edelmann and Schleiss, 1999).

"Increased composting of household food waste would reduce
GHG emissions, but may be difficult to achieve in developed
countries, where an additional separation of household waste

waste makes composting attractive as a primary waste treat-

"one in the USA increased from the national average recycling
rate to the per capita recycling rate achieved in Seattle,
Washington, the result would be a reduction of 4% of total US
GHG emissions (Ackerman, 2000). While often associated
with affluent countries, recycling is also an integral part of the
informal economy of developing countries; innovative
approaches to recycling have been adopted in poor neighbour-
hoods of Curitiba, Brazil, and in other cities.

"Other new opportunities involve composting or anaerobic
digestion of agricultural and food industry wastes. Livestock
manure management accounts for 10% of US methane emis-
sions; capture of about 70% of the methane from livestock
manure appears technologically feasible. Some 20% of the fea-
sible methane capture is profitable under existing conditions,
with a carbon price of zero; 28% can be recovered at

(Schnell, 1999). In Germany and Switzerland, pilot projects
compress the methane from biogas plants and supply it to nat-
ural gas vehicles. Canadian engineers have completed a pilot
project using a mixture of waste-activated sludge, food waste,
industrial sludge from potato processing, and municipal waste
paper. Methane production reached 50 I/kg of total solids, and
heavy metal contamination was found to be far below regula-
tory levels (Oleszkiewicz and Poggi-Varaldo, 1998). Woody
waste with high lignin content cannot be converted to methane,
and yard waste is better handled by composting.

"The literature on techniques for increasing the rate of recycling
is too extensive for adequate citation here (see, for example,
Ackerman (1997) and numerous sources cited there). One
much-discussed initiative is the use of variable rates, or pay-
per-bag/per-can charges for household solid waste collection.
This provides a clear financial incentive to the householder to
produce less waste, particularly when accompanied by free
curbside recycling (Franke et al., 1999). Strict packaging and
lifetime product responsibility laws for manufacturers in
Germany have brought about innovations in the manufacture
and marketing of a wide range of products. Other market
incentives such as repayable deposits on glass containers, lead
acid batteries, and other consumer products have led to major
gains in recycled materials in many countries. Voluntary recy-
cling programmes have met with a mixed range of success,
with commercial and institutional recycling of office paper and
cardboard, and curbside recovery of mixed household materi-
als generally having higher recycling rates. Countries such as
Austria and Switzerland successfully require separation of
household waste into many disaggregated categories for high
value recovery.

Fluidized bed combustion (FBC) is a very efficient and
flexible system that can be used for intermittent opera-
tion, and can run with solid, liquid, or gaseous fuels.
Despite high operating costs, this low pollution com-
bustion technology is increasingly used in Japan, and
has also been used in Scandinavia and the USA (NEDO,
1999; http://www.residua.com/wrftbfbc.html).

Gasification (partial incineration with restricted air sup-
ply) and pyrolysis (incineration under anaerobic condi-
tions) are two technologies that can convert biomass
and plastic wastes into gas, oil, and combustible solids.
Gasification of biomass produces a gas with a heating
value of 10%-15% that of natural gas. When integrated
with electricity production, it can prove economically
and environmentally attractive; it appears best suited
for clean biomass, such as wood wastes. Pilot projects
are now using pyrolysis for plastic wastes, and for
mixed municipal solid waste (MSW); they potentially
have very high energy efficiency (Faaij et al., 1998).
Combined pyrolysis and gasification (Thermoselect)
and combined pyrolysis and combustion
(Schwelbrenn-Verfahren) have also been developed
and implemented.

Co-incineration of fossil fuel jointly with waste leads to
improved energy efficiency. Stringent emission stan-
dards in some countries may limit the extent to which
co-incineration is possible (Faaij et al., 1998). In other
countries, emission standards for industrial combustion
processes are less tight than those for incinerators, lead-
ing some to fear that co-incineration might produce
higher emissions of air pollutants (Kossina and
Zehetner, 1998).

fuel deposits, and different authors and institutions have vari-

fossil fuel sources. The World Energy Council defines
resources as “the occurrences of material in recognisable form”
(WEC, 1998b). For oil and gas, this is essentially the amount
of oil and gas in the ground. Reserves represent a portion of
these resources and is the term used by the extraction industry.
British Petroleum notes that proven reserves of oil are “gener-
ally taken to be those quantities that geological and engineer-
ing information indicates with reasonable certainty can be
recovered in the future from known reservoirs under existing
economic and operating conditions” (BP, 1999). Resources,
therefore, are hydrocarbon deposits that do not meet the crite-

geosciences and upstream technologies — as in the past — will
improve knowledge of and access to resources and, if demand
exists, convert these into reserves. Market conditions can

Hydropower is projected to grow by 60%, mainly in
China and other Asian countries.

New renewables have expanded substantially, in

distribution of heat and/or cooling within areas with sufficient-

basis for increased dispersed cogeneration. Industrial CHP uti-

More recently, in some countries electricity market deregula-

their own electricity as well as heat by being more easily able
to sell any surplus electricity (see Section 3.8.5.1). Conversely,
following deregulation in Germany and elsewhere, large grid
CHP has suffered market loss as a consequence of existing sur-

"IGCC systems utilize the efficiency and low capital cost
advantages of a CCGT by first gasifying coal or other fuel.
Gasifiers are usually oxygen blown and are at the early com-
mercial stage (Goldemberg, 2000). Coal and difficult liquid
fuels such as bitumens and tar can be used as feedstocks.
Biomass fuels are easier to gasify (Section 3.8.4.3.2), which
may reduce the cost and possibly the efficiency penalty as an
oxygen plant is not required (Lurgi GmbH, 1989). Gas clean-
up prior to combustion in the gas turbine, which is sensitive to
contaminants, is one of the current areas of development. The
potential efficiency of IGCCs is around 51%, based on the lat-
est CCGTs of 60% efficiency (Willerboer, 1997). Vattenfall,
using a GE Frame 6 gas turbine, indicated a net efficiency of
48% in trials (Karlsson et al., 1998), and an efficiency of 50%-
55% was claimed to be achievable by using the latest gas tur-
bine design. With continuing development in hot gas cleaning
and better heat recovery as well as the continuing development
of CCGTs, commercially available coal- or wood-fired IGCC
power stations with efficiencies over 60% may be feasible by
2020.

"The future of nuclear power will depend on whether it can
meet several objectives simultaneously — economics, operating
safety, proliferation safeguards, and effective solutions to
waste disposal. While present new nuclear power plants
already incorporate unprecedented levels of safety based on in-
depth designs, their economics need further improvement to be
competitive in most markets. Safe waste disposal for approxi-

and would add US$0.0002/kWh to generating costs (Kadak,

are higher, i.e., US$0.0013. Proliferation is a political issue pri-
marily, but can also be addressed by technology. Evolutionary
technology improvements of existing designs are important
elements for the near-term viability of nuclear power but may
not be sufficient to meet all the objectives optimally. For exam-
ple, smaller grid sizes in developing countries demand smaller
unit size reactors. Therefore, new technology that addresses
these objectives by integral design holds the key to the future

"Technological approaches for safe and long-term disposal of
high-level radioactive waste have been extensively studied
(Posiva Oy, 1999; EC, 1999). One possible solution involves
deep geological repositories, however, no country has yet dis-
posed of any spent fuel or high-level waste in such a reposito-
ry because of public and political opposition (NEA, 1999).
Several countries are actively researching this issue. Long-
term disposal of radioactive wastes should not be an intractable
problem from a technical perspective, because of the small
quantities of storage space required (Goldemberg, 2000;
Rhodes and Beller, 2000). Radioactive waste storage density
limits defined for storing light water reactor (LWR) fuel at
Yucca Mountain are about 41 m?/MW, of nuclear generating
capacity for a power plant over its expected 30 years of oper-
ating life?? (Kadak, 1999). High level waste volumes can be
further reduced if spent fuel is reprocessed so that most of the
plutonium and unused uranium is extracted for reuse. The
remaining high-level waste is compacted and “vitrified” (melt-
ed with other ingredients to make a glassy matrix), and placed
into canisters that are appropriate for long-term disposal.
However, reprocessing of spent fuel and the separation of plu-
tonium are often viewed as potentially opening the door for
nuclear weapons proliferation. For this and economic reasons,
several countries therefore prefer once-through fuel cycles and
direct disposal of spent reactor fuel.

of the containment from the plant periphery to the pebble fuel;
a high in-shop manufacturing component of the plant, and a

As a base load station with a depreciation period of 20 years

Finland (Hall and Rosillo-Calle, 1998b; Moomaw ef al.,

the availability of suitable land. In addition to energy crops
(Section 3.6.4.3), biomass resources include agricultural and
forestry residues, landfill gas and municipal solid wastes. Since
biomass is widely distributed it has good potential to provide
rural areas with a renewable source of energy (Goldemberg,
2000). The challenge is to provide the sustainable manage-

"The remote locations of many potential hydro sites result in
high transmission costs. Development of medium (<SOMW) to
small (<10MW) scale projects closer to demand centres will
continue. In countries where government or aid assistance is
provided to overcome the higher investment costs/MW at this
scale, power generation costs around US$0.065/kWh will
result (UK DTI, 1999). Mini- and micro-hydro low head tur-
bines are under development but generating costs at this scale
are likely to remain high, partly as a result of the cost of the
intake structure needed to withstand river flood conditions.
Even at this small scale, environmental and ecological effects
often result from taking water from a stream or small river and
discharging it back again, even after only a short distance.

about 10% of electricity generated is from biomass cogeneration

when grown on set-aside land (Veenendal et al., 1997), and
they are unlikely to become more cost effective before 2010
(Scharmer, 1998). Commercial biodiesel has therefore only
been implemented in countries where government incentives
exist. Biofuels can only become competitive with cheap oil if
significant government support is provided by way of fuel tax
exemptions, subsidies (such as for use of set-aside surplus
land), or if a value is placed on the environmental benefits
resulting.

"Biofuels are generally easier to gasify than coal (see Section
3.8.4.1.3), and development of efficient BIGCC systems is near-

projects have been evaluated with varying degrees of success
(Stahl and Neergaard, 1998; Irving, 1999; Pitcher and Lundberg,

combined-cycle plant of this scale is estimated to fall from over
US$2,000/kW at present to around US$1,100/kW by 2030, with
operating costs, including fuel supply, declining from
3.98c/kWh to 3.12c/kWh (EPRI/DOE, 1997). By way of com-

"Ethanol production using fermentation techniques is commer-
cially undertaken in Brazil from sugar cane (Moreira and
Goldemberg, 1999), and in the USA from maize and other
cereals. It is used as a straight fuel and/or as an oxygenate with
gasoline at 5%-22% blends. Enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocel-
lulosic feedstocks such as bagasse, rice husks, municipal green
waste, wood and straw (EPRI/DOE, 1997) is being evaluated
in a lt/day pilot plant at the National Renewable Energy
Laboratory and is nearing the commercial scale-up phase

woody biomass continues with successful conversion of
around 50% of the energy content of the biomass at a cost esti-
mate of around US$0.90/litre (US$34/GJ) (Saller et al., 1998).
In Sweden production of biofuels from woody biomass (short
rotation forests or forest residues) was estimated to cost
US$0.22/litre for methanol and US$0.54/litre for ethanol
(Elam et al., 1994). However, the energy density (MJ/l) of
methanol is around only 50% that of petrol and 65% for

and more efficient utilization which, in many instances, com-

vide rural development (Hall and Rosillo-Cale, 1998b). For
example, production of liquids for cooking, from biomass
grown in small-scale plantations, using the Fischer-Tropsch
process (modified to co-produce electricity by passing uncon-
verted syngas through a small CCGT), is being evaluated for
China using corn husks (Larson and Jin, 1999). Biomass and
biofuel were identified by a US Department of Energy study
(Interlaboratory Working Group, 1997) as critical technologies
for minimizing the costs of reducing carbon emissions. Co-fir-
ing in coal-fired boilers, biomass-fuelled integrated gasifica-
tion combined-cycle units (BIGCC) for the forest industry, and
ethanol from the hydrolysis of lignocellulosics were the three
areas specifically recognized as having most potential.
Estimates of annual carbon offsets from the uptake of these
technologies in the USA alone ranged from 16-24Mt, 4.8Mt,
and 12.6-16.8Mt, respectively, by 2010. The near term energy
savings from use of each of these technologies should cover
the associated costs (Moore, 1998), with co-firing giving the

earth’s land surface is exposed to a mean annual wind speed high-
er than 5.1 m/s at 10 metres above ground (WEC, 1994).
Assuming that for practical reasons just 4% of that land area
could be used (derived from detailed studies of the potential of
wind power in the Netherlands and the USA), wind power pro-
duction is estimated at some 20,000 TWh/yr, which is 2.5 times
lower than the assessment of Grubb and Meyer (1993) (see Table
3.32). The Global Wind Energy Initiative, presented by the wind
energy industry at the 4"" Conference of Parties meeting in
Buenos Aires (BTM Consult, 1998), demonstrated that a total
installed capacity of 844GW by 2010, including offshore installa-
tions, would be feasible. A report by Greenpeace and the
European Wind Energy Association estimated 1,200GW could be

"Wind power continues to become more competitive, and com-
mercial development is feasible without subsidies or any form
of government incentives at good sites. In 1999, for example,
a privately owned 32MW wind farm constructed in New
Zealand on a site with mean annual wind speed of greater than
10m/s was competing at below US$0.03/kWh in the wholesale
electricity market (Walker ef al., 1998). The rapidly falling
price of wind power is evidenced by the drop in average prices
(adjusted for short contract lengths). Over successive rounds of
the British NFFO (non-fossil-fuel obligation), average ten-
dered kWh prices declined from 7.95p in 1990 to 2.85p
(US$0.043/kWh) in 1999 (Mitchell, 1998; UK DTI, 1999).
These confirm the estimate of Krohn (1997) that wind generat-
ed electricity costs from projects >1OMW would decline to
US$0.04/kWh on good sites. The global average price is
expected to drop further to US$0.027—-0.031/kWh by around
2020 as a result of economies of scale from mass production
and improved turbine designs (BTM consult, 1999).
EPRI/DOE (1997) predicted the installed costs will fall from
US$1,000 to US$635/kW (with uncertainty of +10% -20%),
and operating costs will fall from 0.01¢c/kWh to 0.005c/kWh.
However, on poorer sites of around 5m/s mean annual wind
speed, the generating costs would remain high at around
US$0.10-0.12/kWh (8% discount rate).

stream (post-combustion capture) or from the fuel gas in, for
example, an integrated gasification combined cycle process
(pre-combustion capture). At present, the capture of CO, from
flue gases is done using regenerable amine solvents (Audus,
2000; Williams, 2000). In such processes, the flue gas is
scrubbed with the solvent to collect CO,. The solvent is then
regenerated by heating it, driving off the CO,, which is then
compressed and sent to storage. This technology is already in
use for removing CO, from natural gas, and for separating CO,

a very easy step, but the temperature of combustion must be
moderated by recycling CO, from the exhaust, something
which has been demonstrated for use with boilers but would
require major development for use with gas turbines.
Currently, the normal method of oxygen production is by cryo-

"In pre-combustion capture processes, coal or oil is reacted with
oxygen, and in some cases steam, to give a fuel gas consisting
mainly of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The carbon monox-

CO, and more hydrogen. Similar processes can be used with
natural gas but then air may be preferred as the oxidant (Audus
et al., 1999). The fuel gas produced contains a high concentra-
tion of CO,, making separation easier, so a physical solvent
may be better suited for this separation; the hydrogen can be
used in a gas turbine or a fuel cell. Similar technology is
already in use industrially for producing hydrogen from natur-
al gas (e.g., for ammonia production). The integrated operation
of these technologies for generating electricity whilst capturing

"CO, exists in natural underground reservoirs in various parts of
the world. Potential sites for storage of captured CO, are
underground reservoirs, such as depleted oil and gas fields or
deep saline reservoirs. CO, injected into coal beds may be
preferentially absorbed, displacing methane from the coal;
sequestration would be achieved providing the coal is never
mined. Another possible storage location for captured CO, is
the deep ocean, but this option is at an earlier stage of devel-
opment than underground reservoirs; so far only small-scale
experiments for preliminary investigation have been carried
out (Herzog et al., 2000); the deep ocean is chemically able to
dissolve up to 1800GtC (Sato, 1999). An indication of the
global capacities of the major storage options is given in Table
3.34. The capacities of these reservoirs are subject to substan-
tial uncertainty, as purposeful exploration has only been con-
ducted in some parts of the world so far. Other published esti-

Nearly 1Mt/yr of CO, is being stored in a deep saline
reservoir about 800m beneath the bed of the North Sea
as part of the Sleipner Vest gas production project
(Baklid and Korbol, 1996). This is the first time CO,
has been stored purely for reasons of climate protec-
tion.

About 33Mt/yr of co, is used at more than 74
enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects in the USA.
Most of this CO, is extracted from natural CO, reser-
voirs but some is captured from gas processing plants.
Much of this CO, remains in the reservoir at the com-
pletion of oil production; any CO, produced with the
oil is separated and reinjected. An example of an EOR
scheme which will use anthropogenic CO, is the
Weyburn project in Canada (Wilson et al., 2000). In
this project, 5,000 t/d of CO, captured in a coal gasifi-
cation plant in North Dakota, USA will be piped to the
Weyburn field in Saskatchewan, Canada.

At the Allison unit in New Mexico, USA, (Stevens et
al., 1999), over 100,000 tonnes of CO, has been inject-
ed over a three-year period to enhance production of
coal bed methane. The injected CO, is sequestered in
the coal (providing it is never mined). This is the first
example of CO,-enhanced coal bed methane produc-
tion.

Coal mines are ventilated to dilute the methane as it is released

emissions can be reduced substantially by capturing some of
the methane in a more concentrated form in areas of old work-

methane prior to mining, then using it as an energy source.
Around 50% of emissions from coal mining could be prevent-

"In many countries, state owned or state regulated electricity
supply monopolies have been privatized and broken up to
deregulate markets such that companies compete to generate
electricity and to supply customers. These moves affect the
types of power station favoured. Traditional, large power sta-
tions (> 600MW) have had high capital costs and construction
periods of 4-7 years, which have led to high interest payments
during construction and the need for higher planning margins.
Under the new circumstances, the new power generators use
higher discount rates, seek lower overall costs, and try to min-
imize project risks by preferring plants of smaller unit size.
They thus favour projects with low capital costs, rapid con-
struction times, use of proven technology, high plant reliabili-

these new criteria, and are favoured by generators where gas is
available at acceptable costs. This could point the way for the
development of new designs for other types of power station,
which need to be smaller with modular designs that are large-
ly factory built rather than site built. Economies of scale then
come from replication on an assembly line rather than through
size (see also Section 6.2.1.3).

the mitigation options varies both because of variability in the
costs of the alternative technology and because of the variabil-
ity in the costs of the baseline technology.

"In the tables, the first column of data gives the generation costs
in USc/kWh and the emissions of CO, in grams of carbon per
kWh (gC/kWh) for the baseline technology and fuel, coal, and
gas, respectively. The subsequent columns give a range of pos-
sible generation options, and the costs and emissions for alter-
native technologies that could be used to reduce C emissions
over the next 20 years and beyond. Additionally, it might be
noted that the non-Annex I baseline coal technology is cheap-
er than that for Annex I countries (both based on the costs of
power stations under construction) and that CO, emissions

"2000; Audus, 2000; Freund, 2000; Davison, 2000;
Goldemberg, 2000; OECD, 1998b). The OECD data are for
power stations that are mainly due for completion in 2000 to
2005 in a wide cross section of countries, and these show that
costs can vary considerably between projects, because of
national and regional differences and other circumstances.
These include the need for additional infrastructure, the trade-
off between capital costs and efficiency, the ability to run on
baseload, and the cost and availability of fuels. The costs of
reducing greenhouse gas emissions will similarly vary both
because of variability in the costs of the alternative technology
and because of the variability in the costs of the baseline tech-
nology. Because of this large variation in local circumstances,
the generating costs of studies can rarely be generalized even
within the boundaries of one country. Consequently, costs (and
mitigation potentials) are highly location dependent. The
analysis in this section uses two principle sources of data, the
OECD (1998b) data and the US DOE/EIA (2000) data. The lat-
ter data are for a single country and may reduce some of the
variability in costs seen in multi-country studies.
"	Text
"Tables 3.35a-d are derived from the OECD (1998b) survey
which gives data on actual power station projects due to come
on stream in 2000 to 2005 from 19 countries including Brazil,
China, India, and Russia, together with a few projects for 2006
to 2010 based on more advanced technologies. Data from other
sources have been added where necessary and these are identi-
fied in the footnote to the tables. The tables present typical
costs per kWh and CO, emissions of alternative types of gen-
eration expected for 2010. Tables 3.35a and 3.35b use a base-
line pulverized coal technology for comparative purposes.
Table 3.35a contains data for Annex I countries (as defined in
the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change) in the
OECD dataset, and Table 3.35b contains data for non-Annex I
countries. In addition to coal, the table gives projected costs for
gas, nuclear, CO, capture and storage, PV and solar thermal,
hydro, wind, and biomass. In the baseline, costs and carbon
emissions are an average of the coal-fired projects in the
OECD database for Annex I/non-Annex I countries respective-
ly, with flue gas desulphurization (FGD) included in all Annex
I cases and in around 20% of the non-Annex I cases. Other
technologies are then compared to the coal baseline using cost
data from the OECD database and other sources. In Tables
3.35c and 3.35d, the baseline technology is assumed to be
CCGT burning natural gas, and costs and emissions are simi-
larly calculated for Annex I and non-Annex I countries.
"	Text
"Tables 3.35a-d also present estimates of the CO, reduction
potential in 2010 and 2020 for the alternative mitigation
options. Baseline emissions of CO, are used, derived from
projections of world electricity generation from different ener-
gy sources (IEA, 1998b). The IEA projections essentially are
enveloped by the range of SRES marker scenarios for the peri-
od up to 2020. The IEA projections were used as the baseline
because of their shorter time horizon and higher technology
resolution. In the tables, it is assumed that a maximum of 20%
of new coal baseline capacity could be replaced by either gas
or nuclear technologies during 2006 to 2010 and 50% during
2011 to 2020. Similarly, it is assumed that a maximum of 20%
of new gas capacity in 2006 to 2010 and 50% in 2011 to 2020
could be displaced by mitigation options. These assumptions
would allow a five-year lead-time (from the publication of this
report) for decisions on the alternatives to be made and con-
struction to be undertaken. It is assumed that the programme
would build up over several years and hence the maximum
capacity that could be replaced to 2010 is limited. After 2010
it is assumed that there will be practical reasons why half the
new coal capacity could not be displaced. The rate of building
gas or nuclear power stations that would be required using
these assumptions should not present problems. For nuclear
power, the rate of building between 2011 and 2020 would be
less than that seen at the peak for constructing new nuclear
plants. For gas, the gas turbines are factory made, so no prob-
lems should arise from increasing capacity, and less would be
required in terms of boilers, steam turbines, and cooling tow-
ers than the coal capacity being replaced. For renewables such
as wind, photovoltaics (PV) and biomass, maximum penetra-
tion rates were derived from the Shell sustainable growth sce-
nario (Shell, 1996) and applied to replace new coal or gas
capacities. For wind and PV, these penetration rates imply sub-
stantial growth, but are less than what could be achieved if the
industries continued to expand at the current rate of 25% per
year until 2020. For biomass, most of the fuel would be wood
process or forest waste. Some non-food crops would also be
used. The introduction of CO, capture and storage technology
would require similar construction processes as for a conven-
tional power plant. The CO, separation facilities would need
additional equipment but, in terms of physical construction,
involve no more effort than, say, the establishment of a similar
scale of biomass gasification plant. CO, storage facilities
would be constructed using available oil/gas industry technol-
ogy and this is not seen to be a limiting factor. Storage would
be in saline aquifers of depleted oil and gas fields. For CO,
capture and storage, it is assumed that pilot plants could be
operational before 2010, and the mitigation potential is put at
2-10MtC each for coal and gas technologies. It is assumed,
arbitrarily, that these would be in Annex I countries. For 2020,
"	Text
"If a gas-fired baseline is assumed, most of the mitigation
options are found to be more expensive. CO, capture and stor-
age appears relatively attractive, achieving deep reductions in
emissions at around US$150/tC avoided. Wind, biomass, and
nuclear could be attractive options in some circumstances.
Other options show higher costs. PV and solar thermal are
again expensive mitigation options, and, as noted above, are
more suited to niche markets and off-grid generation.
"	Text
"the total mitigation potential is put at 40-200MtC, split equal-
ly between coal and gas, and between Annex I and non-Annex
I countries. Again, this is somewhat arbitrary, but reflects, on
the one hand, the potential to move forward with the technolo-
gy if no major problems are encountered, and, on the other, the
potential for more extended pilot schemes. It is assumed, for
simplicity, that fuel switching, from coal to gas or vice versa,
would not occur in addition to CO, capture and storage,
although this would be an extra option.
"	Text
"In contrast to the OECD data which span a wide range reflect-
ing local circumstances, Table 3.35e presents costs for the
USA, mainly based on data used in the Annual Energy
Outlook of the US Energy Information Agency (US DOE/EIA,
2000). By and large, the mitigation costs fall in the range of
costs given in Tables 3.35a-d. The electricity generating costs
are based on national projections of utility prices for coal and
natural gas, while capital costs and generating efficiencies are
dynamically improving depending on their respective rates of
market penetration. The table indicates that once sufficient

"In practice, a combination of technologies could be used to dis-
place coal and natural gas fired generation and the choice will
often depend on local circumstances. In addition to the descrip-
tion in the tables, oil-fired generation could also be displaced
and, on similar assumptions, there is a further mitigation poten-
tial of LOMtC by 2010 and 40MtC by 2020. Furthermore, in
practice not all of the mitigation options are likely to achieve
their potential for a variety of reasons — unforeseen technical
difficulties, cost limitations, and socio-political barriers in
some countries. The total mitigation potential for all three fos-
sil fuels from power generation, allowing for potential prob-
lems, is therefore estimated at about 50-150MtC by 2010 and
350-700MtC by 2020.
"	Text
"Table 3.35e also gives estimated CO, emissions and mitigation
costs compared to either a coal-fired pf power station or a gas-
fired CCGT. For the coal base-case, it is projected that in 2010
under assumptions of improved fossil fuel technologies, an
IGCC would offer a small reduction in emissions at positive or
negative cost. A gas-fired CCGT has generally negative miti-
gation costs against a coal-fired pf baseline, reflecting the
lower costs of CCGT in the example used. CO, capture and
storage would enable deep reductions in emissions from coal-
fired generation but the cost would be about US$100-150/tC
depending on the technology used. Gas-fired CCGT with CO,
capture and storage appears attractive, but this is principally
because switching to CCGT is attractive in itself. Nuclear
power mitigation costs are in the range US$50-100/tC when
coal is used as the base for comparison. It is uncertain whether
there would be sufficient capacity available for wind or bio-
mass to deliver as much electricity as could be produced by
fossil fuel-fired plants, but certainly not at the low costs shown
in Table 3.35e.
"	Text
"The tables show that the reduction potential in 2020 is sub-
stantially higher than in 2010, which follows from the assump-
tions used and reflects the time taken to take decisions and,
especially in the case of renewables and CO, capture and stor-
age, to build up manufacturing capacity, to learn from experi-
ence, and to reduce costs. The tables show that each of the mit-
igation technologies can contribute to reducing emissions, with
nuclear, if socio-politically desirable, having the greatest
potential. Replacement of coal by gas can make a substantial
contribution as can CO, capture and storage. Each of the
renewables can contribute significantly, although the potential
contribution of solar power is more limited. The potential
reductions within each table are not addable. The alternative
mitigation technologies will be competing with each other to
displace new coal and gas power stations. On the assumption
about the maximum displacement of new coal and gas power
stations (20% for 2006 to 2010, 50% for 2011 to 2020), the
maximum mitigation that could be achieved would be around
140MtC in 2010 and 660MtC in 2020. These can be compared
with estimated and projected global CO, emissions from power
stations of around 2400MtC in 2000, 3150MtC in 2010 and
4000MC in 2020 (IEA, 1998b).
"	Text
"capacities have been adopted in the market place, coal-fired
integrated gasification combined cycle power stations would
have similar costs but lower emissions than the pulverized fuel
(pf) power station (because of its higher efficiency). In many
places, gas-fired CCGT power stations offer lower cost gener-
ation than coal at current gas prices and produce around only
half the emissions of CO,. Data on CO, capture and storage
have been taken from IEA Greenhouse Gas R & D Programme
studies (Audus, 2000; Freund, 2000; Davison, 2000). This
could reduce emissions by about 80% with additional costs of
around 1.5c/kWh for gas and 3c/kWh for coal pf and
2.5c/kWh for coal IGCC. In the EIA study, nuclear power is
more expensive than coal-fired generation, but generally less
than coal with carbon capture and storage. Wind turbines can
be competitive with conventional coal and gas power genera-
tion at wind farm sites with high mean annual speeds. Biomass
can also contribute to GHG mitigation, especially where
forestry residues are available at very low costs (municipal
solid waste even at negative costs). Where biofuel is more
costly, either because the in-forest residue material used
requires collection and is more expensive or because purpose
grown crops are used, or where wind conditions are poorer, the
technologies may still be competitive for reducing emissions.
Photovoltaics and solar thermal technologies appear expen-
sive against large-scale power generation, but will be increas-
ingly attractive in niche markets or for off-grid generation as
costs fall.

potential that they have for reducing GHG emissions. In many
areas, technical progress relevant to GHG emission reduction
since the SAR has been significant and faster than anticipated. A
broad array of technological options have the combined potential
to reduce annual global greenhouse gas emission levels close to
or below those of 2000 by 2010 and even lower by 2020.
"	Text
"Costs of options vary by technology, sector and region (see
cost discussion in Table 3.37). Based upon the costs in a major-
ity of the studies, approximately half of the potential for emis-
sions reductions cited above for 2010 and 2020 can be
achieved at net negative costs (value of energy saved exceeds
capital, operating and maintenance costs) using the social dis-
count rates cited. Most of the remainder can be achieved at a
cost of less than USS100/C,,.
"	Text
"The section on energy sources indicates that there are many
alternative technological ways to reduce GHG emissions,
including more efficient power generation from fossil fuels,
greater use of renewables or nuclear power, and the capture and
disposal of CO,. There are also opportunities to reduce emis-
sions of methane and other non-CO, gases associated with
energy supply. In general, this new review reinforces the con-
clusions reached in the SAR, as discussed in Section 3.8.2.
"	Text
"The overall rate of diffusion of low emission technologies is
insufficient to offset the societal trend of increasing consump-
tion of energy-intensive goods and services, which results in
increased emissions. Nevertheless, substantial technical
progress has been made in many areas, including the market
introduction of efficient hybrid engine cars, the demonstration
of underground carbon dioxide storage, the rapid advancement
of wind turbine design, and the near elimination of N,O emis-
sions from adipic acid production.
"	Text
"It was not possible to calculate the emission reduction poten-
tial of the short-term mitigation options presented in this
Chapter on the basis of the SRES scenarios, mainly because of
lack of technological detail in the SRES. In order to come to a
comprehensive emission reduction estimate, it has been
ensured that for all the sectors the estimates are compatible
with one of the scenarios, i.e. the B2-Message (standardized)
scenario. The emission reductions presented in Table 3.37 total
14% - 23% of baseline emissions in the year 2010 and to 23%
- 42% of baseline emissions in the year 2020.79 If these per-
centages also apply to the other scenarios - there is no obvious
reason why this would not be the case — it is concluded that in
most situations the annual global greenhouse gas emission lev-
els can be reduced to a level close to or below those of 2000 by
2010 and even lower by 2020.

There are no consistent estimates of technological and
economic potential covering all the major regions of
the world;

Country- and region-specific studies employ different
assumptions about the future progress of technologies
and other key factors;

Studies make different assumptions about the difficulty
of overcoming barriers to the market penetration of
advanced technologies and the willingness of con-
sumers to accept low-carbon technologies;

Most studies do not describe a range of costs over a
domain of carbon reduction levels, and many report
average rather than marginal mitigation costs; and
Social discount rates of 5%-12% are commonly used in
studies of the economic potential for specific technolo-
gies which are lower than those typically used by indi-
viduals and in industry.

already been achieved through major technological advances.
"	Text
"Agriculture contributes 20% of total global anthropogenic
emissions, but although there are a number of technology mit-
igation options available, such as soil carbon sequestration,
enteric methane control, and conservation tillage, the widely
diverse nature of the sector makes capture of emission reduc-
tions difficult.
"	Text
"Hundreds of technologies and practices exist to reduce green-
house gas emissions from the buildings, transport, and indus-
trial sectors. These energy efficiency options are responsible
for more than half of the total emission reduction potential of
these sectors. Efficiency improvements in material use (includ-
ing recycling) will also become more important in the longer
term.
"	Text
"Process changes, improved containment, recovery and recy-
cling, and the use of alternative compounds and technologies
have been implemented. Potential for future reductions exists,
including process-related emissions from insulated foam and
semiconductor production, and by-product emissions from alu-
minium and HCFC-22. The potential for energy efficiency
improvements connected to the use of fluorinated gases is of a
similar magnitude to reductions of direct emissions.
"	Text
"Appropriate policies are required to realize these potentials.
Furthermore, on-going research and development is expected
to significantly widen the portfolio of technologies to provide
emission reduction options. Maintaining these R&D activities
together with technology transfer actions will be necessary if
the longer term potential as outlined in Table 3.37 is to be real-
ized. Balancing mitigation activities in the various sectors with
other goals such as those related to development, equity, and
sustainability is the key to ensuring they are effective.
"	Text
"The energy supply and conversion sector will remain dominat-
ed by cheap and abundant fossil fuels but with potential for
reduction in emission caused by the shift from coal to natural
gas, conversion efficiency improvement of power plants, the
adoption of distributedcogeneration plants, and carbon dioxide
recovery and sequestration. The continued use of nuclear
power plants (including their lifetime extension) and the appli-
cation of renewable energy sources will avoid emissions from
fossil fuel use. Biomass from by-products, wastes, and
methane from landfills is a potentially important energy source
which can be supplemented by energy crop production where
suitable land and water are available. Wind energy and
hydropower will also contribute, more so than solar energy
because of the latter’s relatively high costs.

"Other sources of HFC and PFC emissions are industrial solvent
applications, medical aerosol products, other aerosol products,
fire protection, and non-insulating foams. A variety of options
are available to reduce emissions including increased contain-
ment, recovery, destruction, and substitution by non-fluorocar-
bon fluids and not-in-kind technologies. There are no zero- or
low-GWP alternatives for some medical and fire protection
applications.

"In 1997, the production of HFCs was about 125 kilotons
(SOMC,,,), and the production of PFCs amounted to 5 kilotons
(12MtC,,,). The production of HFCs in 2010 is projected to be
about 370 kilotons or L7OMtC,, and less than 12MtC,, for
PFCs, assuming current trends in use and regulations, substan-
tial investment in new HFC production capacity, and success of
voluntary agreements. Since most of the HFCs and some of
the PFCs are contained in equipment or products, annual emis-
sions lag production when use is growing.

"In the absence of the Montreal Protocol the use of chlorine-
containing compounds and especially CFCs would have
expanded significantly. However, because of this treaty,
developed countries replaced about 8% of projected chloroflu-
orocarbon use with HFCs, 12% with HCFCs, and eliminated
the remaining 80% by controlling emissions, specific use
reductions, or by using alternative technologies and fluids
including ammonia, hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, water, and
not-in-kind options.

"Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and to a lesser extent perfluoro-
carbons (PFCs) have been introduced to replace ozone-deplet-
ing substances (ODSs) that are being phased out under the
Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone
Layer. HFCs and PFCs have a significant global warming
potential (GWP) and are listed in the Kyoto Protocol. This
Appendix estimates consumption and emissions and assesses
alternative practices and technologies to reduce emissions.
Emissions as by-products of manufacturing are treated in the
main part of Chapter 3.

"al can reduce lifetime HFC emissions at moderate to low costs.
Non-HFC alternatives include hydrocarbons, ammonia, and
carbon dioxide, or alternative technologies. Lifecycle climate
performance (LCCP) analysis of the entire system, including
direct fluid emissions and indirect emissions from carbon diox-
ide resulting from energy use by the device, provides a means
of assessing the net contribution of a system to global climate
change. The LCCP calculations are very system specific and
can be used to make relative rankings. However, since the
LCCP approach involves regional climate conditions and local
energy sources, the results cannot be generalized in order to
make globally valid comparisons.

"Insulating foams are anticipated to become the second largest
source of HFC emissions and HFC use is expected to grow
rapidly as CFCs and HCFCs are replaced with HFC-134a,
HFC-245fa, and HFC-365mfc. Alternative blowing agents
including the different pentanes and carbon dioxide have
lower direct climate impact from direct emissions. However,
they also have lower insulating values than CFCs and HCFCs,
and hence may have higher indirect emissions from energy use
if the foam thickness is not increased to offset the higher con-
ductivity. Non-foam insulation alternatives such as mineral
fibres are also used, and vacuum panels may play a role in the
future.

(PFCs), and ozone depleting substances (ODSs) have recently
been extensively evaluated. The Montreal Protocol Technology
and Economic Assessment Panel (TEAP) and its technical com-
mittees published a comprehensive assessment (UNEP, 1999b).
Furthermore, reports were published within the framework of
the joint IPCC/TEAP workshop (IPCC/TEAP, 1999) and the

"Most HFCs are used for energy-consuming applications such
as refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pumps, and building
and appliance insulation. Life cycle climate performance
(LCCP) analysis is being used to estimate the net contribution
to climate change. It includes all direct greenhouse gas emis-
sions and indirect emissions related to energy consumption
associated with the design and the operational modes of sys-
tems (UNEP, 1999b; Papasavva and Moomaw, 1998). The
LCCP is a very system specific parameter that can be used to
make relative rankings. However, LCCP analysis involves
regional differences — including different fuel sources — and
the related equipment operating conditions; the results can
therefore not be generalized in order to make globally valid
comparisons.

"was in insulating foams, fire protection, refrigeration, air con-
ditioning, and heat pumps, with more than half as aerosol
product propellants, non-insulating foam, solvent, and special-
ized applications. However, by 1997, the global consumption
of fluorocarbons (CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs) had decreased by
about 50% as solvent, aerosol product, and non-insulating
foam applications switched to alternatives other than fluoro-
carbons. Refrigeration, air conditioning, and insulating foam
accounted for about 85% of the remaining total fluorocarbon
use. 80% of projected chlorofluorocarbon demand was avoid-
ed by reducing emissions, redesign, and use of non-fluorocar-
bon technologies. As CFCs, halons, and HCFCs are phased out
globally, the quantities of fluorocarbons are expected to con-
tinue to decline in the short term, but are expected to grow in
the longer term.

"Future global HFC and PFC consumption and/or emissions as
substitutes for ODSs have been separately estimated by IPCC
(1995), Midgley and McCulloch (1999), and UNEP (1998a).
Midgley and McCulloch (1999) projected carbon-equivalent
emissions of HFCs and PFCs (excluding unintended chemical
by-product emissions) at 60MtC,, in 2000, ISOM(C,, in 2010
and 280MC,, in 2020. Projected consumption data for 2000
and 2010 are primarily based on UNEP reports (UNEP, 1998f,
1999b) and are shown in Table A3.2. Considering that emis-
sions lag consumption by many years, the Midgley and
McCulloch figures are much larger than the UNEP figures.
This discrepancy is consistent with the Midgley and
McCulloch scenario which was constructed to represent plau-
sible upper limits to future emissions (McFarland, 1999). HFC
emissions in the SRES scenarios (IPCC, 2000) are 54MtC,, in

"The energy efficiency of equipment and products can be
expressed in at least three ways: theoretical maximum effi-
ciency, maximum efficiency achievable with current technolo-
gy, and actual efficiency for commercial scale production
(often expressed as a range of values). Systems optimized for
anew refrigerant have been compared to sub-optimum systems
with other refrigerants. Furthermore, appliance sizes and fea-
tures that influence energy performance vary between studies
and test conditions, and methodologies are often significantly
different. These factors have led to a wide range of energy effi-
ciency claims in technical reports and commercial publica-
tions. Ultimately, the performance and cost effectiveness of
specific products from commercial scale production must be
directly compared. Furthermore, costs reported in this appen-
dix might not always be comparable because of differing esti-
mation methods, including estimates based on both consumer
and producer costs.

those presented in Table A3.2 because of the top-down

"If safety is a concern, secondary loops containing a heat trans-

ing, there is no energy penalty from using a secondary loop.
For medium temperature applications in food processing and
commercial refrigeration, secondary loops permit the safe use
of ammonia and hydrocarbons, or enable minimization of an
HEC refrigerant charge, generally with a modest energy penal-
ty. If safety concerns require a secondary loop for low temper-
ature applications in food processing and cold storage, in
which normally the refrigerant is used as the direct heat trans-

"Hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, and to a lesser extent, ammonia
are the most likely alternatives to HFC refrigerants. No ammo-

Since both hydrocarbons and ammonia are flammable and
ammonia is toxic, their acceptance will depend on cultural
norms and specific regulations in each country. Hydrocarbons
are currently being used in about 50% of the refrigerators man-
ufactured in Europe and in some manufactured in Asia and Latin
America; their use in these products as well as in other refriger-
ation and air conditioning systems could increase. Large charges
can present a safety concern, and globally standardized mechan-
ical and electrical safety standards are being established.

"The primary options for limiting HFC emissions are the use of
alternative refrigerants and technologies, reduced refrigerant
charge, improved containment, recovery with recycling, and/or
destruction. There are no globally representative estimates of
the cost effectiveness of improved containment and recovery.
In developed countries, recovery during servicing of small
domestic refrigerators captures a relatively insignificant pro-
portion of HFCs, while end-of-life recovery is significant. For
medium-sized devices such as commercial units with substan-
tial leakage rates, recovery during both multiple servicing and
at the end of useful life is both significant. For very large units
recovery both during servicing and at end of life is frequently
done already because of the high economic value associated
with the large quantities of recovered fluids.

"Most current and projected HFC consumption and emissions is
in this sector. HFC consumption in refrigeration and mobile
and stationary air conditioning in 1997 was, on a mass basis,
about 30% of projected developed country CFC consumption
in the absence of the Montreal Protocol (McFarland, 1999).
Most of the remaining 70% of projected consumption has been
eliminated by reducing leaks, reduced charge per application,
and improved service practices; the substitution by other fluids
and new technologies played a lesser role (some substitution —
a few per cent — by HCFCs also took place). Globally, there is
still a huge potential to further reduce HFC emissions.
Estimated consumption and emissions of HFCs for this sector
for 2000 and 2010 are shown in Table A3.2. Emissions signif-
icantly lag consumption because HFC systems are relatively
new so emissions will occur well after 2010.

"Carbon dioxide emissions associated with energy consumption
by refrigeration, air conditioning, and heat pump equipment
are usually the largest contributions to global warming associ-
ated with cooling equipment (AFEAS, 1991; Papasavva and
Moomaw, 1998). Japanese manufacturers estimate that energy-
related CO, emissions represent an even larger fraction of life-
time emissions for their low leakage rate, small charge appli-
ances. Thus, improvements in equipment energy efficiency are
often a cost-effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
and to lower costs to consumers (March, 1998). Proper equip-
ment design, component performance, and the selection of the
most appropriate refrigerant fluid are the most important fac-
tors contributing to energy efficiency. Examination of the
LCCP of the system will determine which combination of
operating efficiency and fluid choice yields the lowest overall
contribution to global warming.

By 2002 to 2003, it is technically feasible to reduce system
charge and leakage rates worldwide. It is estimated that the
vehicle charge in the US can be reduced from 0.9kg to 0.8kg
and that annual vehicle leakage could be reduced from 0.07
kg/yr to 0.04kg/yr (UNEP, 1998a; Baker, 1998; Sand et al.,
1997; Wertenbach and Caesar, 1998). In Europe, refrigerant
charges average about 0.7 kg per vehicle (Clodic, 1999). For
the USA it is estimated (Baker, 2000) that emissions can be
reduced from 8% to 5% per year for a 10-year reduction of 1.2
kg/vehicle without recovery and recycling or 1.0kg with recov-
ery and recycling. Two studies (Harnisch and Hendriks, 2000;

reduce leakage rates from 10% to 4%-5%/yr is only US$11-
US$13.

at the 1999 Phoenix Forum comparable to HFC-134a systems

Systems using flammable refrigerants will require additional
engineering and testing, development of safety standards and
service procedures, and training of manufacturing and service
technicians before commercialization, but would require fewer
technical breakthroughs than carbon dioxide systems. If

from several European vehicle manufacturers provided compa-

one reported improved efficiency over HFC systems at the
Scottsdale Symposium (SAE, 1999). A CO, system in a small
vehicle was less efficient, especially during idling (Kobayashi

efficiently operate in reverse mode to heat vehicle interiors.
New equipment and technician training will be required to

higher than systems with HFC-134a. The first CO, systems

Three authors have published estimates of the cost of emission

reductions achieved through alternative vehicle air condition-
ing using carbon dioxide as the refrigerant (March, 1998;
Baker, 1999, 2000; Harnisch and Hendriks, 2000). These stud-
ies reported widely diverging results on the specific abatement
costs of HFC emissions for the use of transcritical CO, systems
(from US$90 to >US$1000/C,,). Differences in cost estimates
can be traced back to a number of factors among which two are
most important: (1) the use of producer-costs versus consumer
costs and (2) differing assumptions about the existing degree of
recovery of HFC-134a during servicing and at the end of life.
Of lesser importance were differing assumptions on the aver-
age fluid charge of an HFC air conditioning system, annual
leakage rates, relative differential costs, and applied discount
rates. Once the results are normalized to common assumptions
on the major factors, the abatement costs differ by only a fac-
tor of two or less (see Table A3.4).

"HFC emission reductions achieved during servicing and
through recovery of the refrigerant upon disposal of appliances
are costly. Next to economic incentives, regulations (as already
exist for CFC-containing appliances in several countries)
would probably be required to obtain significant emissions
reductions through HFC recovery (March, 1998). One study
(Harnisch and Hendriks, 2000) reports a value of US$334/tC,,
for the recovery of HFCs from refrigerators; the larger part of
this is the cost for the transport and collection scheme.

differences among regions are likely to be significant factors in

stringent national regulations are leading to a replacement of
HCFC-22 in virtually all new equipment, ultimately by 2010.
The leading HFC alternatives are R-407C and R-410A (UNEP,

available for many more years and the use of HFC blends may

ammonia and HCFC-22 if the equipment is not very well

with an insignificant market share at present, but it is estimat-

demand for HFCs is expected to grow by about 40% between
2000 and 2010. It is expected that recovery and re-use will be

low pressure HFCs may take over the low-pressure market

often lower than local climatic conditions would predict.
Increasing insulation use can therefore often go towards
improving comfort levels as well as saving energy use and

“liquid” HFCs such as HFC-245fa and HFC-365mfc) are antic-

with similar insulating properties. The contribution of the foam
to the overall energy efficiency of the appliance is important

"In North America, the timber frame method of construction has
contributed to a more widespread use of polyurethane (PU),

PU and PIR systems also have better production economics
than in Europe because of higher line speeds and less stringent
thickness tolerance criteria. In Japan, the market is shaped by
strict fire codes and much of the construction is based around
concrete. PU spray foams have done particularly well in
enclosed spaces and use of phenolic foam is preferred in some
exposed applications because of its lower flammability com-
pared to other alternatives. In developing countries, the use of

"The use of HFC blown foams in the residential sector is
expected to be relatively limited because of the high cost-sen-

choice of insulation for all buildings on a proper consideration
of the LCCP, including the comparative energy saving impacts
of alternative insulation materials, the potential emissions of
blowing agents, and the embodied energies of the insulating
materials themselves. Where HFCs are used, the cost to
destroy the HFC will be determined primarily by the cost of
separating the construction materials. There are trends towards
prefabricated construction and requirements for recycling of
building materials in some regions that could lower these costs
in time. Emissions of HFCs partially offset the benefits of low
energy consumption arising from their use.

"The use of hydrocarbon and carbon dioxide as blowing agents
for polyurethane and extruded polystyrene insulation foams is

hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide, respectively. It is estimated
that substituting the remaining HFCs by hydrocarbon use in the
mass markets of polyurethane foam production would cost
between US$90 and USS125/C,,. There is some concern
about the use of flammable hydrocarbons in the residential
environment and indoor air quality could also be affected. The
replacement of HFCs by CO,/water blown polyurethane spray

about US$80/C,, (Harnisch and Hendriks, 2000). In Europe,
one major producer is converting its extruded polystyrene pro-

its azeotropic blends with alcohol, hydrochlorocarbons, and
hydrocarbons were introduced in the mid-1990s to replace CFC-
113 and PFCs. HFE solvents became commercially available in
the late 1990s to replace PFCs, CFCs, HCFCs, and HFCs.

"Less than 3% of projected demand for CFCs solvents has been
replaced by HFCs and PFCs (McFarland, 1999).The high cost
of fluorocarbons, regulatory prohibitions on HFC and hydro-
fluoroethers and hydrofluoroesters (HFE) solvents, and invest-
ment in emission reduction measures are expected to maintain
carbon equivalent use and emissions in 2010 to current base-
line levels. Annual PFC solvent emissions are estimated at
3,000-4,000 tonnes (UNEP, 1999b; Harnisch et al., 1999) and
HFC emissions are estimated to be 1,000—2,000 tonnes (UNEP,
1999b). These values convert to less than 7.5MtC,, for PFCs
and less than 1 Mc, for HFCs.

"HFCs and HFEs are used in specialized cleaning of delicate
materials, oxygen systems, and precision parts; as a flush fluid
for particulate removal in precision cleaning; as a rinsing agent
in a co-solvent process for cleaning printed circuit boards and
mechanical components; and to dry electronics and precision
parts after aqueous or semi-aqueous processing. In some cir-
cumstances, HFC drying may have a lower LCCP than thermal
drying. HFCs and HFEs are also replacing PFCs and CFC-113
as carrier fluids for specialized fluorocarbon lubricants, as
dielectric and heat transfer fluids, in developing latent finger-
prints off porous surfaces, in rain repellent sprays for aircraft
windshields, and in other applications demanding unique sol-
vency properties (UNEP, 1998e, 1999b).

"For commercial buildings, the choice of foam type and facings
is more likely to be based on lifetime costs (performance relat-
ed) than on initial cost. An additional factor is the increased
use of prefabricated building techniques, particularly in
Europe. Both aspects suggest that HFC blown foams could
penetrate the commercial and industrial sectors to a greater
extent than the residential sector previously discussed.
Harnisch and Hendriks (2000) estimate that avoiding HFCs in
most mass applications by switching to hydrocarbon systems
would cost in the region of US$90 to USS125/C,,. For the
switch from HFC to CO, use in extruded polystyrene, one
study estimates USS40/tC,, (March, 1998), whilst another
(Harnisch and Hendriks, 2000) estimates US$25/tC,, for the
remaining European manufacturers.

tion processes and product designs to avoid the need for fluo-
rocarbon solvents (e.g., “no-clean” soldering and aqueous

"Global 1998 consumption and emissions of HFCs in non-med-
ical aerosol products was less than 15,000 tonnes (UNEP,
1998d) with two-thirds HFC-134a and one-third HFC-152a —
less than 4MtC,,. Emissions of HFCs are projected to not
exceed 20,000 tonnes in 2010 (IPCC/TEAP, 1999) or about
SMC, , (calculated assuming equal emissions of HFC-134a
and HFC-152a). HFCs have replaced only about 2% of the
aerosol product market that would have used CFCs had there
not been the Montreal Protocol (McFarland, 1999).
Hydrocarbon, dimethyl! ether (DME), carbon dioxide, nitrogen
propellants, and not-in-kind alternative products have replaced
the remaining 98% of projected demand.

"HFCs are used in aerosol products primarily to comply with
technical requirements or environmental regulations. HFC-
134a is the propellant of choice for products that must be com-
pletely non-flammable. An example of HFC use based on a
technical requirement is non-flammable, far-reaching insecti-
cide products used on high-voltage power lines and transform-
ers where workers cannot escape from wasps and hornets.
HFC-152a is the propellant of choice to replace hydrocarbon
aerosol propellants restricted in Southern California and in
some applications where hydrocarbons and dimethyl] ether are
too flammable but the flammability of HFC-152a is acceptable.
HFC-134a and HFC-152a are the propellants of choice for lab-
oratory, analytical, and experimental uses where chemical prop-
erties are important and flammability may be a concern.

"The abatement cost estimates to reduce future HFC emissions
by replacing MDIs with DPIs depend on the price of DPIs. The
cost per equivalent dose varies between products and coun-
tries, with some CFC-free MDIs being more expensive than
CFC-based MDIs and some DPIs more expensive than both
CFC- and HFC-based MDIs (ARCF, 2000). In Europe, prices
are less as much as US$4 higher for a DPI than for a compa-
rable MDI (Harnisch and Hendriks, 2000). It is estimated that,
by 2010, the EU can reduce HFC emissions by 30% at a cost
of about US$460/C,, and 50% at about US$490/tC,, (March,
1998), which translates to a differential cost of US$4 over
MDIs; for one country in Europe there is no differential cost
(Harnisch and Hendriks, 2000). It is not currently medically
feasible to replace MDIs by DPIs completely because approx-
imately 25% of MDI use is for patients who require medication
be forced into their respiratory system (Oko-Recherche, 1999).
"	Text
"There are estimated to be 300 million patients with asthma and
COPD worldwide. Approximately 450-500 million MDIs are
used annually worldwide with asthma prevalence increasing as
urbanization of developing countries continues. It is estimated
that 10,000 metric tons (tonnes) of CFC and 1000 tonnes of
HFCs were used in MDIs worldwide in 1998 (UNEP, 1998b,
1999b). HFC-based MDIs are essential for the near-term CFC
phaseout, because other available options, including dry pow-
der inhalers (DPIs) (single or multi-dose), nebulizers (hand
held or stationary), orally administered drugs (tablets, cap-
sules, or oral liquids), and injectable drugs, which are alterna-
tives for not using CFCs or HFCs, cannot currently replace
CFC products for all patients (UNEP, 1999b). The transition to
HFC MDIs began in 1995, and approximately 5% in 1998 and
10% in 1999 contain HFC (UNEP, 1999b). HFC-based MDIs
and DPIs are expected to help minimize the use of CFCs by
2005 in developed countries, while providing essential med-
ication for patients. Important factors in the conversion to DPIs
will include their acceptance by doctors, patients, insurance
companies, and medical authorities.

"Emissions of HFC from the installed bank of fire protection
equipment, including necessary emissions to suppress fires, are
estimated to be about 4%—6% per year (UNEP, 1999b). These
emissions could be reduced by up to 50% through continued
improvements to eliminate unnecessary discharges and by
increased recycling of the HFCs (IPCC/TEAP, 1999). There
are no estimates of the cost-effectiveness of such measures.

like the CFC boycotts in the early 1970s that led to national
bans on certain cosmetic products. Boycotts could threaten
sales of all aerosol products because consumers may not be
able to distinguish targetted HFC products from acceptable
hydrocarbon products (UNEP, 1999b).

"The Montreal Protocol prompted various improvements in the
management of halons and their replacements, resulting in a
fourfold decrease in annual emissions. Testing and training
with halon and HFC was eliminated and the unintended dis-
charges of systems were greatly reduced through intensified
maintenance and operational improvements. With only 20% of
new fire protection systems using HFCs and with the fourfold
decrease in emissions, HFC emissions are 5% compared to
those from halon systems before the Montreal Protocol (UNEP,
1999b; McFarland, 1999).

"Growth in HFC use is limited by high cost compared to other
choices. PFCs are not technically necessary as halon replace-
ments except in rare and special circumstances (UNEP, 1999b).
However, relatively strong growth of HFC/PFC use in devel-
oping countries and countries with economies in transition is
being driven by aggressive marketing, and is producing a new
dependency that could lead to a rapidly growing market in
applications where other alternatives are available. Awareness
campaigns involving fire protection experts and their cus-
tomers could help limit uses that are not technically justified
(UNEP, 1999b).

"Application of these principles justifies the use of HFCs for
some products in some circumstances but these “responsible

rigid foam sector, most small and medium-sized enterprises

in this selection of hydrocarbons because of safety concerns
and related higher manufacturing costs. Next to large compa-

"Certain non-ODP substitutes and alternative technologies to
CFCs and HCFCs have become available in recent years for
many applications. The selection of the substitute or alternative
technology is based on a balance of maturity, availability, cost-
effectiveness, energy-efficiency, safety, and safety costs. The
selection is also influenced by local circumstances, preferences
of enterprises, accessibility and cost-effectiveness of certain
technologies, joint venture partners and customers, availability
of training, and regulatory compliance. This implies that devel-
oping countries need access to the newest information and
need to be part of an adequate technical review process so that
they can assess the choice of the most appropriate and inte-
grated environmental solutions. In addition, those developing
countries that receive financial assistance from the MLF for the
conversion process and select HCFC-based technologies must
submit a thorough justification as to why these are preferred.
This is because the countries have to take into account the deci-
sions by the Montreal Protocol Parties that state that certain
fluorocarbon-based technologies should be avoided if more
environmentally friendly and acceptable technologies are
available, as well as the guidelines developed by the MLF
Executive Committee for the implementation of these tech-

which includes both the refrigeration and the foam part; their
share is about 66% in the replacement of ODS foam blowing

and regarding the impact of possible restrictions on the use of
HFCs in certain developed countries may delay the implemen-
tation of the Montreal Protocol in EITs and developing coun-

the Montreal and Kyoto Protocols and it is the subject of fur-
ther study.

"As shown in Table A3.6, the contribution of HFC-based tech-

to 21% of the total ODS replacement in the sector, if both the
refrigeration and the insulating foam part are included. Where
it concerns the refrigeration part, for both domestic and com-
mercial refrigeration, HFCs constitute about 89% of the refrig-
erant replacement. The conversion of refrigeration compo-
nents and the refrigeration manufacturing plants is to a large
extent determined by market availability and by market forces
(compressor suppliers); of course, there is also a direct relation
to manufacturing and safety costs.

"Under the Multilateral Fund, enterprises are eligible for finan-
cial assistance for only one conversion. This makes it crucial
for an enterprise to choose a technology that is cost effective,
environmentally acceptable, and globally sustainable. It is very
important that developing countries and countries with
economies in transition examine opportunities for consistent
strategies to simultaneously protect the ozone layer and to mit-
igate climate change. Such opportunities, inter alia, may be in
the field of emission reductions, the direct transition to non-flu-
orocarbon low GWP alternatives where possible, as well as in
the field of enhancing energy efficiencies. It would be advan-
tageous if assistance given by the multilateral fund could be
expanded to extra assistance from the GEF in terms of address-
ing the energy efficiency optimization aspect.

"	Title
"In some tropical countries, however, the average net loss of
forest carbon stocks continues, though rates of deforestation
may have declined slightly in the last decade. In agricultural
lands, options are now available to recover partially the C lost
during the conversion from forest or grasslands.
"	Text
"Land is a precious and limited resource used for many purpos-
es in every country. The relationship of climate mitigation
strategies with other land uses may be competitive, neutral, or
symbiotic. An analysis of the literature suggests that C mitiga-
tion strategies can be pursued as one element of more compre-
hensive strategies aimed at sustainable development, where
"	Text
"able balance between the two goals is constrained by distur-
bance history, site productivity, and target time frame. For
example, options to maximize sequestration by 2010 may not
maximize sequestration by 2020 or 2050; in some cases, max-
imizing sequestration by 2010 may lead to higher emissions in
later years.
"	Text
"The effectiveness of C mitigation strategies, and the security of
expanded C pools, will be affected by future global changes,
but the impacts of these changes will vary by geographic
region, ecosystem type, and local abilities to adapt. For exam-
ple, increases in atmospheric CO,, changes in climate, modi-
fied nutrient cycles, and altered disturbance regimes can each
have negative or positive effects on C pools in terrestrial
ecosystems.
"	Text
"The mitigation costs through forestry can be quite modest,
US$0.1-US$20/tC in some tropical developing countries, and
somewhat higher (US$20—US$100/tC) in developed coun-
tries. The costs of biological mitigation, therefore, are low
compared to those of many other alternative measures. The
costs would be expected to rise, however, if large areas of land
were taken from alternative uses. The technologies for pre-
serving existing terrestrial C and enhancing C pools, while
using biomass in a sustainable way, already exist and can be
further improved.
"	Text
"Terrestrial ecosystems offer significant potential to capture and
hold carbon at modest social costs. The Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Second Assessment Report
estimated that about 60 to 87GtC could be conserved or
sequestered in forests by the year 2050 and another 23 to 44
GtC could be sequestered in agricultural soils. In this chapter,
we describe and assess biological mitigation measures in ter-
restrial ecosystems, focusing on the physical mitigation poten-
tial, ecological and environmental constraints, economics, and
social considerations. Also the so-called geo-engineering
options are discussed.
"	Text
"Carbon reservoirs in most ecosystems eventually approach
some maximum level. Thus, an ecosystem depleted of carbon
by past events may have a high potential rate of carbon accu-
mulation, while one with a large carbon pool tends to have a
low rate of carbon sequestration. As ecosystems eventually
approach their maximum carbon pool, the sink (i.e., the rate of
change of the pool) will diminish. Although both the seques-
tration rate and pool of carbon may be relatively high at some
stages, they cannot be maximized simultaneously. Thus, man-
agement strategies for an ecosystem may depend on whether
the goal is to enhance short-term accumulation or to maintain
the carbon reservoirs through time. The ecologically achiev-
"	Text
"Increased carbon pools from management of terrestrial ecosys-
tems can only partially offset fossil fuel emissions. Moreover,
larger C stocks may pose a risk for higher carbon dioxide
(CO,) emissions in the future, if the C-conserving practices are
discontinued. For example, abandoning fire control in forests
or reverting to intensive tillage in agriculture may result in
rapid loss of at least part of the C accumulated during previous
years. However, using biomass as a fuel or wood to displace
more energy-intensive materials in products can provide per-
manent carbon mitigation benefits. It is useful to evaluate ter-
restrial sequestration opportunities alongside emission reduc-
tion strategies as both approaches will likely be required to
control atmospheric CO, levels.
"	Text
"In the past, land management has often resulted in reduced C
pools, but in many regions like Western Europe, C pools have
now stabilized and are recovering. In most countries in tem-
perate and boreal regions forests are expanding, although cur-
rent C pools are still smaller than those in pre-industrial or pre-
historic times. While complete recovery of pre-historic C
pools is unlikely, there is potential for substantial increases in
carbon stocks. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
and the UN Economic Commission for Europe (ECE)’s statis-
tics suggest that the average net annual increment has exceed-
ed timber fellings in managed boreal and temperate forests in
the early 1990s. For example, C stocks in the live tree biomass
has increased by 0.17billion tonnes (gigatonnes = Gt) C/yr in
the USA and 0.11GtC/yr in Western Europe, absorbing about
10% of global fossil CO, emissions for that time period.
Though these estimates do not include changes in litter and
soils, they illustrate that land surfaces play a significant and
changing role in the atmospheric carbon budget and, hence,
provide potentially powerful opportunities for climate mitiga-
tion.

would consider:

"Activities undertaken for other reasons may enhance mitiga-
tion. An obvious example is reduced rates of tropical defor-
estation. Furthermore, because wealthy countries generally
have a stable forest estate, it could be argued that economic
development is associated with activities that build up forest
carbon reservoirs in the long run.
"	Text
"In practice, by the year 2010 mitigation in land use, land-use
change, and forestry activities can lead to significant mitiga-
tion of CO, emissions. Many of these activities are compatible
with, or complement, other objectives in managing land. The
overall effects of altering marine ecosystems to act as carbon
sinks or of applying geo-engineering technology in climate
change mitigation remain unresolved and are not, therefore,
ready for near-term application.
"	Text
"increasing C stocks is but one of many objectives. Often, mea-
sures can be adopted within forestry, agriculture, and other
land uses to provide C mitigation and, at the same time, also
advance other social, economic, and environmental goals.
Carbon mitigation can provide additional value and income to
land management and rural development. Local solutions and
targets can be adapted to priorities of sustainable development
at national, regional, and global levels.
"	Text
"Wood and other biological products play several important
roles in carbon mitigation: they act as a carbon reservoir; they
can replace construction materials that require more fossil fuel
input; and they can be burned in place of fossil fuels for renew-
able energy. Wood products already contribute somewhat to
climate mitigation, but if infrastructures and incentives can be
developed, wood and agricultural products may become vital
elements of a sustainable economy: they are among the few
renewable resources available on a large scale.
"	Text
"Non-tropical countries also have opportunities to preserve
existing C pools, enhance C pools, or use biomass to offset fos-
sil fuel use. Examples of strategies include fire or insect con-
trol, forest conservation, establishing fast-growing stands,
changing silvicultural practices, planting trees in urban areas,
ameliorating waste management practices, managing agricul-
tural lands to store more C in soils, improving management of
grazing lands, and re-planting grasses or trees on cultivated
lands.
"	Text
"In tropical regions, there are large opportunities for C mitiga-
tion, though they cannot be considered in isolation from broad-
er policies in forestry, agriculture, and other sectors.
Additionally, options vary by social and economic conditions:
in some regions, slowing or halting deforestation is the major
mitigation opportunity; in others, where deforestation rates
have declined to marginal levels, improved natural forest man-
agement practices and, afforestation and reforestation of
degraded forests and wastelands are the most attractive oppor-
tunities.

"Geo-engineering involves efforts to stabilize the climate sys-
tem by directly managing the energy balance of the earth,
thereby overcoming the enhanced greenhouse effect. Although
there appear to be possibilities for engineering the terrestrial
energy balance, human understanding of the system is still
rudimentary. The likelihood of unanticipated consequences is
large, and it may not even be possible to engineer the regional
distribution of temperature, precipitation, etc. Geo-engineering
raises scientific and technical questions as well as many ethi-
cal, legal, and equity issues. And yet, some basic inquiry does
seem appropriate.
"	Text
"Marine ecosystems may also offer possibilities for removing
CO, from the atmosphere. The standing stock of C in the
marine biosphere is very small, however, and efforts could
focus not only on increasing biological C stocks, but also on
using biospheric processes to remove C from the atmosphere
and transport it to the deep ocean. Some initial experiments
have been performed, but fundamental questions remain about
the permanence and stability of C removals, and about possi-
ble unintended consequences of the large-scale manipulations
required to have significant impact on the atmosphere. In addi-
tion, the economics of such approaches have not yet been
determined.
"	Text
"A key to making C mitigation activities effective and sustain-
able is to balance C mitigation with other ecological and/or
environmental, economic, and social goals of land use. Many
biological mitigation strategies may be neutral or favourable
for all three goals and become accepted as “no regrets” or
“win-win” solutions. In other cases, compromises may be
needed. Important potential environmental impacts include
effects on biodiversity, effects on amount and quality of water
resources (particularly where they are already scarce), and
long-term impacts on ecosystem productivity. Cumulative
environmental, economic, and social impacts could be assessed
within individual projects and also from broader, national and
international perspectives. An important issue is “leakage” — an
expanded or conserved C pool in one area leading to increased
emissions elsewhere. Social acceptance at the local, national,
and global scale may also influence how effectively mitigation
policies are implemented.

"The Second Assessment Report (SAR) of the IPCC (1996) sug-
gested that 700Mha of forestland might be available for carbon
conservation globally — 138Mha for slowed tropical deforesta-
tion, 217Mha for regeneration of tropical forests, and 345Mha
for plantations and agroforestry. The IPCC suggested that by
2050 this area could provide a cumulative mitigation impact of
60 to 87GtC, of which 45 to 72GtC in the tropics. Towards the
end of this time interval, the mitigation impact could approach
a maximum rate of 2.2GtC/yr. The cost of mitigation (exclud-

Atmospheric C represents only a fraction (~ 30%) of the C in

while soils contain another 2000 GtC in organic matter and

"The competition for land varies among countries and within a
country. Land-use and forestry policies for C management may
be most successful when climate mitigation is considered
alongside other needs for land, including agriculture, forestry,

recreation. Forest fires, for example, are controlled, in many
parts of the world, not as a measure for carbon mitigation, but
simply because fire threatens areas of human settlement and

actions at one site influence actions elsewhere, a problem not
considered by the SAR) is examined. This report considers
forests, grasslands, croplands, and wetlands, and, where possi-
ble, examines all C pools within them. Carbon mitigation is
evaluated as one of many services provided by ecosystems.
The objectives of this chapter are to review progress made
since the IPCC-SAR, and to evaluate prospects for storing
more carbon in ways that ensure the continued provision of
other goods and services from the varied and finite land

"Similarly, biodiversity and landscape considerations have
motivated protection of old-growth stands in temperate, bore-
al, and tropical rain forests from commercial logging. In many
cases such decisions have prevented C release into the atmos-
phere, even though C mitigation was not the initial intent
(Harmon et al., 1990). The impact of harvest restrictions on C
pool in old-growth forests may be affected by “leakage”. If one
ecosystem is protected but timber demand remains constant,
logging may simply be shifted to another, similar ecosystem
elsewhere, perhaps to a country where conservation priorities
are lower.

"This chapter begins by describing the current state of land use,
the history of land use, ongoing changes in land use, pressures
driving these changes, and potential competition among
demands for land (Section 4.3). It then considers opportunities
for enhanced C stocks, especially in forestry and agriculture
(Section 4.4). Having identified possible C conservation mea-
sures, the physical, environmental, social, and economic
impacts of these measures are examined; and assessment is
made of how they augment or compete with other services pro-
vided by land (Sections 4.5 - 4.7). How these options might be
evaluated and, where appropriate, encouraged (Sections 4.8 and
4.9) is also considered. Finally, the prospects for managing
marine ecosystems to increase carbon sequestration, and the
possibility of managing the global ecosystem by ‘geo-engineer-

"tems to arable lands. Such disruptions typically result in a large
reduction of vegetation biomass and a loss of about 30% of the
C in the surface 1 metre of soil (Davidson and Ackermann,
1993; Anderson, 1995; Houghton, 1995a; Kolchugina et al.,
1995). Globally, conversion to arable agriculture has resulted
in soil C losses of about 50GtC (Harrison ef al., 1993;
Scharpenseel and Becker-Heidmann, 1994; Houghton, 1995a;
Cole et al., 1996; Paustian er a/., 2000), and total emissions of
C from land use change, including that from biomass loss, have
amounted to about 122 + 40GtC (Houghton, 1995b; Schimel,
1995). Most of the soil C losses occur within a few years or
decades of conversion, so that in temperate zones, where there
is little expansion of agricultural lands now, losses of C have
largely abated (Cole et al., 1993; Anderson, 1995; Janzen et al.,
1998; Larionova et al., 1998). Tropical areas, however, remain
an important source of CO, because of widespread clearing of
new lands and reduced duration of “fallow” periods in shifting
agriculture systems (Paustian et al., 1997b; Scholes and van
Breemen, 1997; Woomer et al., 1997; Mosier, 1998).

"A consequence of the conservation of mass is that the net of all of the flows (measured as a rate variable in units such as tC/yr) into
and out of a given reservoir or stock (measured in units such as tC) during a period of time must equal the change in the stock (tC) in
that period. Conversely, a change in stock of a reservoir during a given period must exactly equal the integrated net difference in C
flows into and out of that reservoir during that period. Elsewhere in this text the word “pool” is sometimes used to represent the var-
ious reservoirs of carbon in the global carbon cycle. The word “sink” is used to indicate the net positive flow of carbon into a terres-
trial carbon pool.

"The maximum rate of net ecosystem carbon uptake cannot occur at the same time as the maximum ecosystem carbon stock (see Figure
4.3). An ecosystem depleted of carbon by past events may have much higher rates of carbon accumulation than a comparable one in
which carbon stocks have been maintained. Ecosystems eventually approach some maximum carbon stock — a carrying capacity — at
which time the flows into the carbon pool are balanced by flows out of the carbon pool. Because C sink and C stock in ecosystems
cannot be maximized simultaneously, mitigation activities aimed at enhancing the sink and maintaining the biological carbon stock
coincide only partially (IGBP, 1998). (continued)

"Figure 4.2: Different ecosystems, their components, and human activities. The carbon stocks associated with the different ecosystems
are stored in aboveground and belowground biomass, detrital material (dead organic matter), and soils. Carbon is withdrawn from
the atmosphere through photosynthesis (vertical down arrow), and returned by oxidation processes that include plant respiration,
decomposition, and combustion (vertical up arrow). Carbon is also transferred within ecosystems and to other locations (horizontal

generally have additional effects influencing carbon accumulation in, or loss from, other components. Estimates of ecosystem and
atmospheric C stocks are adapted from Bolin et al. (2000). Values for C stocks in some ecosystems are still very uncertain. Not shown

"Carbon taken up by the biosphere may also accumulate in offsite pools — as products or in landfills — but it continues to oxidize at rates
that depend on the conditions of those pools. It is the net of many flows that defines the changes in carbon stocks of off-site pools as

shows a wide range of estimates, particularly for the first part

(Alcamo and Swart, 1998). These disparities reflect a lack of
agreement on the definition of deforestation, and a lack of
knowledge and agreement on the estimation of C emissions
(Alcamo and Swart, 1998). These scenarios can be divided into
two groups: in one group emissions decline smoothly after

stock of ecosystem C declines. Later in the cycle, dead organic matter stocks may increase, although other components have reached
a steady state. Maximum ecosystem stocks (highest value of ecosystem C) occur at a later time than the maximum rate of net carbon

According to Bawa and Dayanandan (1997), the causes (corre-
lates) of deforestation are many and varied, with complex
interactions. Overall, Bawa and Dayanandan found that popu-
lation density, cattle density, and external debt were the key
factors. In Africa, the most important factors were extraction of
fuelwood and charcoal and demand for cropland; in Asia, it
was cropland; and in Latin America, it was cattle density.

"The rate of population growth is now apparently declining, but
the population, and hence the demand for food and other land
services, is still growing (Roberts, 1999). Population growth
has been widely cited as a major cause of deforestation (Myers,
1989), but the relationship between population and deforesta-
tion is not simple. Population growth exerts increasing pres-
sure on resources, but whether these pressures lead to forest
degradation or to positive changes (e.g., afforestation,
improved forest management, and better technology) depends
largely on social structure. Extensive migration may also lead
to deforestation and soil erosion. Simplistic assumptions about
population and deforestation also do not apply where high pop-
ulation densities and/or growth rates are accompanied by for-
est conservation and reforestation programmes. In India, for
example, deforestation rates have declined since 1980, despite
population growth, owing to effective forest conservation leg-
islation (Ravindranath and Hall, 1994).

Changes in forest management and changes in the environment
have contributed to this trend. In Europe, the trend is consistent
with the observation of increased growth in individual stands
noted by Spiecker et al. (1996). The FAO statistics indicate that
between the 1980s and 1990s both net annual increment and
timber fellings increased, but that the rate of change was lower
for fellings than for growth, resulting in a substantial increase
in the carbon sink from the 1980s to the 1990s (Kuusela, 1994;
Kauppi et al., 1992; Sedjo, 1992; Dixon et al., 1994; UN-

mid-1970s (Kurz et al., 1992); whereas subsequent analyses,
accounting for changes in forest disturbances over time (see
section 4.2.3), indicated that Canadian forests became a small
net source of C (-0.068GtC/yr) by the early 1990s (Kurz and

"Land management decisions are influenced by many factors. In
the temperate zone, and in the European parts of the boreal
zone, these are mainly technological and economic.
Agricultural production is, for example, heavily influenced by
evolving technologies, economic opportunities, subsidies, and
restrictions on international trade. Forestry practices are simi-
larly influenced by economic returns, trade, and pressures from
society (Clawson, 1979; Waggoner, 1994; Wernick ef al.,
1998). It is within these pressures and opportunities that carbon
mitigation possibilities may be found, and preferably they
would be region specific. Table 4.2 gives an overview of some

"Competition for land between forestry and agriculture has
become less severe. Forest area is increasing in many regions
of the boreal and temperate zone, partly because agricultural
yields have improved or because the profitability of marginal
agriculture has declined. The ability to produce agricultural
goods has grown faster than demand, resulting in a downwards
trend in prices (Alig et al., 1990; Waggoner, 1994). Much
abandoned agricultural land has reverted to forest, either natu-
rally or through deliberate planting. Superimposed over these
land conversions is a transition in forestry from a foraging and
gathering operation, dependent upon primary forest, through a
stage of more intensively managed forest, to total forest
ecosystem management. The latter occurs when urbanized
societies press for nature-oriented forest management.
Continuously improving technologies allow low-cost estab-
lishment and higher productivity from planted and plantation
forests (Sedjo, 1983; 1999a). In agriculture, also, practices are
changing towards maintaining site fertility or decreasing the
risk of erosion.

"The concept of “forest disturbance” refers to events such as
forest fire, harvesting, wind-throw, insect and disease outbreak
(epidemics), and forest flooding that cause large pulses of CO,
to be released into the atmosphere through combustion or
decomposition of resulting dead organic matter. Stand-replac-
ing disturbances, such as crown fires and wind-throw, are asso-
ciated with the sudden death of large cohorts of trees near one
another (Pickett and White, 1985; Kurz er al., 1995a, 1995b;
Kurz and Apps, 1999, see Box 4.2). Some disturbance agents,
such as pollution and some insects and disease outbreaks, may
result in large areas with productivity decline but only local
mortality (Hall and Moody, 1994). Disturbances play an
important natural part in the lifecycle and succession dynamics
of many forest systems. In boreal systems large-scale, natural,
stochastic forces tend to dominate the ecosystem dynamics,
even when direct human influences are considered (Kurz et al.,
1995b). The return interval of these disturbances, their intensi-
ty, and their specific impacts are referred to as the disturbance
regime (Weber and Flanigan, 1997). Kurz et al. (1995b) and
Price et al. (1998) (having compiled insect, fire, and harvest
data) showed that the disturbance regime of Canadian forests
changed over the last quarter of the 20th century from about
2.5Mha/yr prior to 1970 to 4Mha/yr between 1970 and 1990.
Using these data, Kurz and Apps (1999) showed that these
changes in the disturbance regime resulted in a switch of
Canadian forests from being a net sink of C to a small net
source of C to the atmosphere.

"Figure 4.5: Conceptual model of soil organic matter decom-
position and accumulation following disturbance (after
Johnson, 1995; IPCC, 2000a). At steady state (I), carbon (C)
inputs from litter (L) equal C losses via decomposition (D)
(i.e., L/D = 1). After a disturbance, D often exceeds L resulting
in loss of C (IL), until a new, lower steady state is reached (LII).
Adoption of new management, where L exceeds D results in a
re-accumulation of C (IV) until a new, higher steady state is
reached (V). The eventual steady state (A, B, or C) depends on
the new management adopted.

"At the stand scale, disturbance events (both natural and anthropogenic) have three main impacts on the carbon budget (Apps and Kurz,
1993). First, they redistribute the existing carbon by transferring carbon from living material, above and below ground, to the dead
organic matter pools. Second, they transfer some of the carbon out of the ecosystem (e.g., into the atmosphere as combustion prod-
ucts, in the case of fire, and/or into the forest product sector as raw feedstock, in the case of harvest). Third, by opening the forest
canopy, the disturbance changes the site micro-environment and restarts the successional cycle for new stand development.
"	Text
"The different types of disturbances are often linked. For exam-
ple, in some forest types the probability of fire may increase
following insect outbreaks because of increases in available
fuel (litter). In some cases salvage logging (recovering the
usable timber following a disturbance) can reduce the total area
of living forest that is disturbed in a given year by all agents
combined. It is common to try to replace natural disturbances
(such as wildfires) with commercial harvesting, using a com-
bination of protection and scheduled logging. In Sweden and
Finland, for example, logging has become the main distur-
bance type; and large-scale natural disturbances resulting from
wildfire, insect outbreaks, or storms have been almost non-
existent for half a century (Lahde er al., 1999).
"	Text
"At the scale of forests (typically comprising many stands), the disturbance regime determines the age-class structure (e.g., the even-
age structure associated with stand-replacing disturbance regimes or the uneven-age structures associated with individual tree mortal-
ity and gap-phase replacement), and age-class structure of stands and trees making up the forest. The C stocks in a forest landscape,
and the changes in these stocks over time, are strongly influenced by the age-class distribution (Kurz et al., 1995b; Turner et al., 1995;
MacLaren, 1996; Apps et al., 2000; Bhatti et a/., 2001). In managed plantation forests, the age-class distribution is controlled by the
management regime and harvest cycle (Heath and Birdsey, 1993; MacLaren, 1996), while in natural forests other mortality agents play
a major role. See Heath er al. (1996) and Kurz et al. (1995a) for examples.

"The RIL (reduced impact logging) project developed by Innoprise, a Malaysian company with forestry activities, and the New England
Power Company, USA, aims to save CO, already stored in forest biomass by reducing damage to vegetation and soils during har-
vesting. The hope is to reduce damage by 50% compared to that of conventional harvesting. The techniques employed are modifica-
tions of conventional bulldozer harvesting techniques; including pre-felling climber cutting, directional felling, skid trail design, and
post harvest operations such as rehabilitation of log landings. Today the total project area amounts to 2,400 ha. The pilot research pro-
ject has quantified the carbon implications and costs on 1,415ha. They found that avoided emissions amounted to 65—-90MgC/ha and
that the associated costs were US$3.55/MgC (Wan Razali and Tay, 2000).

Disturbed forest stands continue to release carbon into the

Regrowth follows, but maximum uptake may not be achieved

activities today may be more or less secure, depending on how
the environment changes and how society adapts to those

impending changes in the environment. Some of the possible

"Disturbances affect the carbon stocks in vegetation, in soil, and
in dead organic matter. All these stocks vary over time as a
function of the history of disturbances (MacLaren, 1996;
Bhatti et al., 2001; Kurz and Apps, 1999). With an increase of
widespread disturbance events the carbon stocks of living veg-
etation decrease and the age-class distribution of the forest
shifts to younger stands containing less carbon. If forests are
disturbed at regular intervals (i.e., an unchanging, disturbance
regime), the carbon stock of large tracts of forest can be rela-
tively stable.

"Increased soil temperatures associated with increased atmos-
pheric CO, have long been expected to result in increased soil
respiration (Schimel, 1995; Townsend and Rastetter, 1996;
Woodwell et al., 1998). Data recently reported by Giardina and
Ryan (2000), however, suggest that decomposition of organic
carbon in mineral soil layers is relatively insensitive to changes
in air temperature. Modelling studies by Liski et al. (1998)
suggest similar results. Nevertheless, IPCC reviews (Bolin et
al., 2000; Prentice et al., 2001) conclude that existing terrestri-
al C sinks may gradually diminish over time, in part because of
increasing losses via respiration.

"Over the long term, as climate gradually changes, the time
scales for adaptation of ecosystems to climatic conditions will
become important. Vegetation types (and other organisms)
have adapted to the combination of site conditions, including
climate, where they now occur. It cannot be assumed that tree
growth will increase with climate change, or that the plant pop-
ulations will remain optimally adapted to their current sites.
Analysis of provenance (seed source) data, in the light of glob-
al change, indicates either no net increase in growth rate as a
result of warming or small decreases in growth rate. Trees may
be under more stress in a changed climate, leaving them more
susceptible to insects and diseases.

"Where plant growth is now limited by nitrogen (N) deficien-
cies, increased deposition of N associated with intensified pro-
duction of bio-available N (Schindler and Bayley, 1993;
Vitousek et al., 1997) may accelerate plant growth. This may,
eventually, enhance the carbon stock of the soil (Wedin and
Tilman 1996). Nadelhoffer et al. (1999) caution, however, that
the global impact of N deposition may be comparatively small.
Moreover, where the N fertilization effect increases growth,
especially in the N-deficient northern forests, it also delays the
hardening-off process, resulting in increased winter damage,
and thus negating some of the growth enhancement (Makipaa
et al., 1999).

"is particularly complex. These changes may result in both pos-
itive and negative feedbacks on C stocks (Houghton et al.,
1998). For example, increases in atmospheric CO, are known
to stimulate plant yields, either directly or via enhanced water-
use efficiency, and thereby to enhance the amount of C added
to soils (Schimel, 1995; Woodwell et al., 1998). Higher CO,
concentrations may also suppress decomposition of stored C,
because C/N ratios in residues may increase and because more
C may be allocated below ground (Owensby, 1993; Morgan et
al., 1994; Van Ginkel et al., 1996; Torbert et al., 1997).
Predicting the long-term influence of elevated CO, concentra-
tions on the C stocks of forest ecosystems remains a research
challenge (Bolin er al., 2000; Prentice et al., 2001).
"	Text
"Management of natural disturbance regimes can provide sig-
nificant C mitigation opportunities, e.g., through activities to
prevent or suppress disturbances. Such measures can signifi-
cantly enhance the strength of C sinks (Kurz et al., 1995a;
Apps et al., 2000; Bhatti et a/., 2001) and maintain existing C
stocks, but only as long as the programmes are maintained.
Other factors being equal, during periods of reduced distur-
bance (e.g., with increasing suppression effort), C stocks tend
to increase as biomass accumulates and litter production (in all
forms) increases: forests act as a sink for atmospheric C (Bhatti
et al., 2001). In contrast, with increasing disturbance (e.g., with
reduction in suppression effort), the net losses of C from forest
ecosystems can exceed inputs from photosynthesis (Figures
4.2 and 4.3) and the forests could become a net source of C. We
note that all forms of disturbance, not just highly visible fires,
play a role in these dynamics. In a changing climate, the con-
trol of new pathogens and immigrant herbivores (especially
insects and disease), to which local forest ecosystems may be
maladapted, may be critical to avoid emissions and maintain
existing forest C stocks.

"The general goal of sequestration activities is to maintain
ecosystems in the sink phase. However, if the system is dis-

large fraction of previously accumulated C may be released into
the atmosphere through combustion or decomposition (Figure

"The net balance of C flows between the atmosphere and the
terrestrial biosphere also undergoes management-induced
cycles that occur over long time scales (decades to millennia),
and that can cause the transition of terrestrial systems from

C mitigation are the human-induced changes that occur on an
annual to centennial time scale. This would include the harvest
cycle of managed, production forests.

"The benefits of these strategies show contrasting temporal pat-
terns. Conservation offers immediate benefits via prevented
emissions. Sequestration impacts often follow an S-curve:
accrual rates are often highest after an initial lag phase and then
decline towards zero as C stocks approach a maximum (e.g.,
Figure 4.3). Substitution benefits often occur after an initial
period of net emission, but these benefits can continue almost
indefinitely into the future (Figure 4.6).

"In terrestrial ecosystems the carbon cycle exhibits natural
cyclic behaviour on a range of time scales. Most ecosystems,
for example, have a diurnal and seasonal cycle. Often this
means that the ecosystem functions as a source of C in the win-

tuations at the global scale, as shown by the annual oscillations
in the global atmospheric CO, concentration. Large-scale fluc-
tuations occur at other temporal scales as well, ranging from
decades (Braswell et al., 1997; Turner et al., 1997; Karjalainen

"The effects of climate change on mitigation activities in the ter-
restrial biosphere are difficult to anticipate, as they are depen-
dent on the timing and the specific spatial character and distri-
bution of changes. Present climate scenarios are neither spa-
tially nor temporally very precise, and averages over the scale
of typical global circulation climate models are inadequate for
estimating impacts on very specific, localized mitigation activ-
ities. Moreover, the responses of ecosystems are dependent on
the ecological mechanisms, the climate change imposed, and
the management responses to these factors. For example, plant-
ing of species adapted to present conditions may be inappro-
priate for future conditions and the species might grow more
slowly under chronic climate change. Conversely, species
planted for an anticipated future climate may not be able to sur-
vive current variations.

"Climate change can also affect the economic and social dimen-
sions of land use and forestry. Currently, productive lands may
become less productive and less attractive for food and fibre
production. The current patterns of land use and disturbance
could change. Model results reported by Darwin et al. (1995,
1996) and others suggest, for example, that conversion from
forestland to cropland is a significant adaptive response to cli-
mate change in some regions. Protection from fire or insect
and/or disease predation, in boreal regions especially, may
become increasingly hard to maintain. Reliable estimates of
risks to, or enhancements of, mitigation activities carried out
today will require increased understanding of the interactions
between the important ecological, economic, and social
impacts of climate change. As described in this chapter, the
carbon stocks in terrestrial ecosystems respond to a combina-
tion of ecological, economic, and social drivers. That will not
change even if the global environment changes.

and to a steady state at the natural carrying capacity for bio-
mass on earth. The technical potential for substitution is relat-
ed to the sustainable production of harvestable biomass and its
substitution for fossil fuels and energy-intensive products.
Clearly, each of these upper limits violates in practice the
ideals of development, equity, and sustainability. And yet,
they help to appreciate that there are bounds on the role that
managing the biosphere might play in carbon mitigation.

"Many silvicultural and forest management practices have been
reported to enhance carbon mitigation (Lunnan ef al., 1991;
Hoen and Solberg, 1994; Karjalainen, 1996; Row, 1996;
Binkley et al., 1997; Price et al. 1998; Birdsey et al., 2000;
Fearnside, 1999; Anonymous, 1999; Nabuurs ef al., 2000).
Measures suggested for forests include: protecting against
fires; protecting from disease, pests, insects, and other herbi-
vores; changing rotations; controlling stand density; enhancing
available nutrients; controlling the water table; selecting useful
species and genotypes; using biotechnology; reducing regener-
ation delays; selecting appropriate harvest methods such as
reduced-impact logging; managing logging residues; recycling
wood products; increasing the efficiency with which forest
products are manufactured and used; and establishing, main-

"A comprehensive systems analysis is useful to fully evaluate
mitigation options. Factors to be considered may include:
ecosystem C stocks and sinks; sustainability, security,
resilience, and robustness of the C stock maintained or created;
temporal patterns of C accumulation; other land-use goals and
related C flows in the energy and materials sector; and effects
on other non-CO, GHGs. For example, one option might have
both a high maximum C stock and a high or more sustained
rate of sequestration, yet be incompatible with other demands
placed on the land. A second option may have a high maximum
C stock, but reach that level only very slowly. Still another
option may offer high short-term sequestration, but reach max-
imum C stocks very quickly. Yet another option might manage
production systems to maximize the flow of harvested carbon
into products, thus maximizing the displacement of alternate,
energy-intensive products. Thus, while a wide array of prac-
tices may be technically possible, options that meet all criteria
may be much fewer, and a combination of complementary
options may best accomplish C mitigation goals. Although sci-
entists now recognize the value of system-wide analyses
(Cohen et al., 1996; Alig et al., 1997), rarely have mitigation
options been subjected to such comprehensive evaluations.

Nevertheless it shows that opportunities vary among countries because of both the national situation, the mix of current forestry
practices, and/or the historic management. One common recommendation of which measures would yield the largest carbon
sequestration can therefore not be given (adapted from Nabuurs et al., 2000).

"Investment costs (US$/tC):This largely includes forest or plantation establishment costs incurred during the initial 2-3 years; discounted for only the initial <
3 year period. For forest protection, the costs include expenditure on erecting barriers for protection, training, and other organizational costs incurred durin
the initial 2-3 year period. Mitigation potential is in pertuity, assuming one full cycle; rotation length for mitigation option subject to harvesting (such as sho
and long rotation) and for others 40 years.

Natural regeneration of forest is increasing the biomass density to that of closed forests on partially degraded open forest areas; assisted or enhanced natur:
regeneration would involve planting a (few) trees and/soil and water conservation activity to assist or enhance natural regeneration.

Plantations involve planting of one or more species at high densities.

Reforestation in a short rotation has a 5 to 15 year harvest cycle, reforestation in a long rotation has a 30-100 year harvest cycle.

Forestation includes both afforestation and reforestation.

increased in recent years, to 2.91Mha/yr in 1995 and
1.82Mha/yr in 1996 (Fearnside, 1998). Reducing the defor-

not re-established do not contribute to long-term carbon
sequestration, though they may reduce atmospheric C in the
short term. But, if a new forest is maintained so that harvest
equals net growth, the forest can both be a source of wood
products and still retain the captured C. In other words, the
sequestration phase may be finite, lasting only a few decades,
but the conservation phase need not be finite. Although there is
an exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and the bio-
mass, a considerable pool of carbon can be permanently stored
in the steady-state biomass while wood products continue to be
produced. This C pool remains withdrawn from the atmosphere
as long as the forest exists. The substitution phase, which

"Latin America, which accounts for 51% of the global area of
tropical forests (FAO, 1997), has an estimated mitigation

includes native forest management, protected areas, commer-

about 4.8GtC for Mexico, 1.4GtC for Venezuela, and 3.5GtC

igation potential, which is largely constrained by land tenure
policies and socio-economic pressures (land availability), is,
however, often much lower than this technical potential. The
feasible socio-economic mitigation potential is about 50% less
than the technical potential in Mexico and about 44% lower
than the technical potential in India (Ravindranath and

C sequestration alone. In the absence of financial incentives,
any C sequestration will likely be incidental, or have the role
of a by-product in the management of forests to produce val-

biome, the optimal mix of management strategies will likely
reflect a balance between various forest management systems
and agricultural production. Existing policies for forest and
agricultural land management, however, do not yet reflect eco-
nomic incentives for C management and probably are not opti-

"Wood removed from a forest by harvest, whether by thinning
or clear-cut, can be viewed as a replacement for the natural
mortality that would otherwise occur eventually (albeit at a
faster rate). Harvested wood provides renewable raw material
for use as fuel, fibre, and building materials; as well as income
and employment for rural populations (Gliick and Weiss,
1996). Globally, about 3.4 billion m? of wood are harvested per
year, excluding wood that is burned on site (FAO, 1997).
Harvest rates are expected to increase at 0.5% per year
(Solberg et al., 1996). Of the total harvest, about 1.8 billion m?
is for fuelwood, used mainly in the tropics. The total fuelwood
consumption in tropical countries increased from 1.3 to 1.7 bil-
lion m? during the period 1990 to 1995 (FAO, 1997; Nogueira
et al., 1998).

"Because of the diversity in the current global forest status and
socio-economic situation, the optimal mix of mitigation strate-
gies will vary with country and region, in both the tropics and
the non-tropics. For many countries, slowing or halting defor-
estation is a major opportunity for mitigation (e.g., Brazil:
Fearnside, 1998, and Mexico: Masera, 1995). In countries such
as India, where deforestation rates have declined to marginal
levels, afforestation and reforestation in the degraded forest
and non-forest lands offer large mitigation opportunities
(Ravindranath and Hall, 1995). Ravindranath and Hall (1995)
have shown the potential of using this degraded land and small
biomass gasifiers to sustainably produce electricity from
woody biomass and displace 40 million tonnes of C annually.
In Africa an important opportunity for mitigation is in con-
serving wood fuel and charcoal through improved efficiencies
of stoves and charcoal kilns (Makundi, 1998). The selection of
mitigation strategies or projects in tropical countries, particu-
larly, will be determined by economic development priorities,

"The effectiveness of various strategies for C sequestration will
depend on the initial status of the forest ecosystems. For lands
without tree cover, afforestation permits large C gains per
hectare (Dyson, 1977; Sedjo and Solomon, 1989). Industrial
plantation forests are already being created on a large scale and
expansion of this area for C sequestration is possible (Sedjo
and Sohngen, 2000). The establishment of forest plantations is
generally the most reliable silvicultural method for afforesta-
tion, reforestation, and sustainable regeneration (regeneration
soon after cutting). Plantation establishment can enhance pro-
ductivity if desired species are planted on suitable sites.
Plantations can reduce the pressures to degrade natural forests
(Sedjo and Botkin, 1997). However, following the harvest of a
mature or old-growth forest, the land can remain a source of
carbon for many decades, even when it is regenerated (Hoen
and Solberg, 1994; Cohen et al., 1996; Schlamadinger and
Marland, 1996; Bhatti et a/., 2001). Therefore, for primary and
mature forests, conserving and protecting the existing C pools
is often the only mitigation option that yields near-term bene-
fits.
"	Text
"To quantify accurately the effects of changes in forest manage-
ment on the net transfer of C to the atmosphere, the whole sys-
tem could be considered (see Box. 4.1). Many earlier studies
focused on the immediate results of forest management mea-
sures, e.g. the higher biomass growth rate following a silvicul-
tural treatment or the protected stock of C if wildfire or logging
is prevented. Global assessments based on these studies (e.g.,
Dixon et al., 1994; Brown et al., 1996b) have limitations.
Estimates, in terms of tC/ha or tC/ha/yr, leave unanswered the
critical questions of the timing, security, and sustainability of
these effects. Also, recent, more comprehensive studies indi-
cate the importance of complete accounting for all the C flows
in and out of the system and the analysis of long-term patterns.
For example, Schlamadinger and Marland (1996) showed that
the positive effect of short-rotation plantations for fossil fuel
substitution is less than implied by the simple substitution of
fossil fuels, because of the continued input of fossil fuels need-
ed to operate the system. While the limitations of earlier stud-
ies are now evident, data for comprehensive analysis at the
global scale are not yet available. This, in part, explains why
global-level estimates of the potential for C mitigation in
forestry remain unchanged from those in SAR.

(e.g., Apps et al., 1999). The annual production of roundwood,
according to FAO (1997) statistics, corresponds to a harvest

final products. This represents a C flux of about 0.3GtC/yr into

emissions. For construction of small buildings in New Zealand,
the carbon substitution effect was larger than the direct carbon

"Use of wood as a fuel reduces CO, emissions from fossil fuels

ing biofuels on agricultural lands are higher than the costs of
using fossil fuel, some form of incentive may be required to
generate significant shifts to biofuels (Sedjo, 1997). The use of
abandoned forest products for energy rather than disposal as
waste can provide additional opportunities for displacing use
of fossil fuels (Apps et al, 1999). Chapters 3 and 6 provide fur-
ther discussion of the use of bioenergy within the energy sec-

"According to the SAR (IPCC, 1996), the current global stock
of C in forest products is about 4.2GtC and the net sink is
0.026GtC/yr. Other sources suggest a stock of 10-20GtC
(Sampson et al., 1993; Brown et al., 1996b) and a global sink
of 0.139GtC/yr (Winjum et al., 1998). There is a large uncer-
tainty in the estimates. Even if the high end of the range is cor-
rect, the C sink in wood products appears small compared to
the current rate of C sequestration in boreal and temperate for-
est ecosystems. Whether the physical pool of carbon in wood
products in use acts as a sink depends on the relative rates of
input and output from the product pool, i.e., the difference
between the production of new products and the decay of the C
stock in existing products (Apps ef al., 1999).

"A systems approach has been used recently to recognize inter-
dependencies among products and sectors. For example,
Adams (1992) and Alig ef al. (1997) examined the effects of
sequestering C in forests in the USA on the availability of agri-
cultural land, and Sedjo and Sohngen (2000) used a sectoral
approach that explicitly recognized interrelations among vari-
ous wood investment decisions, and between wood investment
and C sequestration activities. The systems approach also rec-
ognizes the joint product nature of industrial wood and carbon
sequestration. In a study in Argentina, for example, Sedjo
(1999b) found that timber alone does not generate sufficient
returns to justify plantation investment, but the simultaneous
sequestration of C can justify investment above some threshold
C price. The models do not yet incorporate a potential increase
in demand for wood as a fuel to displace fossil fuels.

"In the developing world most fuelwood and charcoal use is
devoted to satisfying energy needs for cooking (Makundi,
1998). The potential for conservation of fuelwood is signifi-
cant, both through improved cooking stoves and by substitu-
tion with liquefied or gasified biofuels. India, China, and some
African countries have large programmes for the distribution
of more efficient wood stoves. In India alone 28 million
improved stoves have been disseminated (Ravindranath and
Hall, 1995). The carbon mitigation costs of improved wood
stoves in India range from US$0.10/tC abated (Luo and
Hulscher, 1999) to US$12/tC abated (Ravindranath and
Somashekar, 1995). A review of case studies in Asia showed
an average mitigation cost of US$0.8/tC abated in Thailand to
US$1.7/tC in India, through programmes to encourage use of
improved wood stoves (Hulscher et al., 1999). The experience
with wood stoves shows that — when appropriately designed,
implemented, and monitored — efficient stove programmes can
provide substantial benefits to local residents. There are no
estimates of the global potential for carbon conservation via
this option, however, in India alone it is estimated that 20MtC
could be saved annually (Ravindranath and Hall, 1995).

to a roundwood volume of 0.9 billion m? annually, the substi-

possible that for wood products the substitution impact is larg-

"There are few opportunities to augment the accumulation of
carbon in wetlands by improved management. Drainage of
forested peatlands, largely concentrated in boreal regions, can
enhance tree growth significantly, but the net ecosystem carbon
changes are less clear — some studies report large net gains
while others indicate large net losses of carbon to the atmos-
phere (see review by Zoltai and Martikainen, 1996). A more
important mitigation measure, from the perspective of atmos-
pheric CO,, is the preservation of the vast carbon reserves
already present (van Noordwijk et al., 1997) in peatlands.
Drainage of wetlands for agricultural or other uses results in
rapid depletion of stored C (Kasimir-Klemedtsson et al., 1997).

"Globally, wetlands contain large reserves of organic carbon -
about 300 to 600GtC (Gorham, 1991; Eswaren er al., 1993;
Scharpenseel, 1993; Kauppi ef al., 1997). A major portion of
this carbon is found in peat-forming wetlands (peatlands),
often associated with forests, in both northern (302Mha,
397GtC) and tropical (SOMha, 144GtC) biomes (Zoltai and
Martikainen, 1996). Over the long term, peatlands gradually
accumulate additional carbon, because decomposition is sup-
pressed under flooded conditions (Harden ef al., 1992; Mitsch
and Wu, 1995; Rabenhorst, 1995; Zoltai and Martikainen,
1996; Kasimir-Klemedtsson et al., 1997). The beneficial effect
of this carbon accumulation, however, is at least partially off-

"Croplands, as referred to here, are lands devoted, at least peri-
odically, to the production of arable crops (wetland rice,
because of its unique features, is discussed separately). Soil C
in these lands can often be preserved or enhanced by using
farming systems with reduced tillage intensity, thus slowing the
rate at which soil organic matter decomposes (Bajracharya et
al., 1997; Feller and Beare, 1997; Rasmussen and Albrecht,
1997; Dick et al., 1998). Another way to promote higher soil C
is to increase crop yields. This can be done by applying organ-
ic amendments, by effective use of fertilizers, by using
improved crop varieties, or by irrigating. These practices help
replenish soil organic matter by increasing the amount of crop
residues returned to the soil (Raun et al., 1998; Huggins et al.,
1998; Paustian er al., 1997b; Lal et al., 1998; Smith et al., 1997;
Fernandes et al. 1997; Izac 1997). Further, soil C can often be
increased by using practices that extend the duration of C fixa-
tion by photosynthesis; for example, cover crops, perennial for-
ages in rotation, and avoiding bare fallow tend to increase
organic C returns to soil (Lal et al., 1997; Singh et al., 1997a;
Smith et al., 1997; Carter et al. 1998; Tiessen et al., 1998; Tian
et al., 1999; Paustian et al., 1997a, 2000). Farming techniques
that reduce erosion (e.g., terracing, windbreaks, and residue
management) maintain productivity and also prevent loss of C
from agricultural soils. The net effect of soil erosion on atmos-
pheric CO, is still uncertain, however, because the C removed
may be deposited elsewhere and at least partially stabilized (van
Noordwijk et al., 1997; Lal et al., 1998; Stallard, 1998).

"Land-use conversion involves transferring a given land area
from one use to another. Where the shift is to a land use with
higher potential C storage, the conversion can result in
increased C stocks. For example, conversion of cropland to
grassland often increases soil C (e.g., Paustian et al., 1997b;
Reeder ef al., 1998; Potter et al., 1999; Post and Kwon, 2000).
Carbon stocks may also be enhanced by conversion of crop-
land to forests (reforestation, afforestation) or to agroforests
(e.g., Fernandes et al., 1997; Woomer et al., 1997; Falloon et
al., 1998; Post and Kwon, 2000). In some cases, cultivated
lands can be restored as wetlands (Paustian et al., 1998; Lal et

also result in higher net CH, emissions (Willison et al., 1998;

"Grazing lands refer to natural grasslands, intensively managed
pastures, savannas, and shrublands used, at least periodically,
to graze livestock. One way to increase C stocks in these lands
is to introduce new plant species. For example, the introduction
of N-fixing legumes increases productivity, thereby favouring
C storage (Fisher et al., 1997; Conant et al., 2001). Large
increases in soil C have been also reported from the introduc-
tion of deep-rooted grasses in South American savannas (e.g.,
Fisher et al., 1994), though the area over which these findings
apply is still uncertain (Davidson et al., 1995). Other manage-

grazing intensity and frequency (Manley et al., 1995; Ash et

"Sampson ef al. (2000) recently completed a comprehensive
assessment of potential net C storage from land management as
part of the IPCC Special Report on LULUCF (IPCC, 2000a).
According to their estimate, improved management within a
land use could result in global rates of C gain, in 2010, of
0.125GtC/yr for cropland, <0.008GtC/yr for rice paddies,
0.026GtC/yr for agroforestry, and 0.237GtC/yr for grazing
land. Potential rates of C gain in 2010 for land use conversion
were 0.391 GtC/yr for conversion of unproductive cropland
and grasslands to agroforests, <0.004GtC/yr for restoring
severely degraded land, 0.038GtC/yr for conversion of crop-
land to grassland, and 0.004GtC/yr for conversion of drained
land back to wetland. Corresponding rates of potential C gains
for 2040 were consistently higher than those for 2010, often by
a factor of about 2, though confidence in these values was
lower. Sampson et al. (2000) cautioned that their estimates
“are approximations, based on interpretation of available data”
and that, “for some estimates of potential carbon storage, the
uncertainty may be as high as 50%”.

"Various attempts have been made to estimate potential C stor-
age by improved management of agricultural lands. In the
IPCC Second Assessment Report, Cole et al. (1996) estimated
the potential for C storage in agricultural soils from improved
management of existing croplands, restoration of degraded
lands, and conversion to grass or forestlands. By assuming that
one-half to two-thirds of the estimated historic C loss from cul-
tivated soils could be recovered in 50 years, they proposed
potential soil C increases of about 0.4 to 0.6GtC/yr from better
management of existing agricultural soils. According to their
estimates, additional C could be stored by set-aside of surplus
upland soils (0.015 to 0.03GtC/yr), restoration of wetlands
(0.006 to 0.012GtC/yr), and restoration of degraded lands
(0.024 to 0.24GtC/yr), yielding a combined potential of about
0.44 to 0.88GtC/yr over a 50-year period. Later studies have
provided similar estimates. Lal and Bruce (1999), using rates
of soil C gain from the literature, estimated global C storage
potentials of 0.43 to 0.57GtC/yr in the next 20-50 years, from
erosion control, soil restoration, conservation tillage and
residue management, and improved cropping practices. Batjes
(1999), based partly on C gains estimated by Bruce ef al.
(1999), proposed that an additional 14GtC (+7) could be stored
in agricultural soils over the next 25 years by improved man-
agement of “degraded” and “stable” agricultural lands.
Including “extensive grasslands” and “regrowth forests”
increased the estimate to 20GtC (+10), corresponding to an
average rate of 0.58 to 0.80GtC/yr.

"Soil carbon sequestration, however, may sometimes have some
potential adverse effects on the emission of other GHGs,
notably nitrous oxide (N,O). Where the C accumulation
requires addition of higher amounts of N as fertilizer or

al., 1993; Batjes, 1998). Furthermore, some C-conserving
practices like reduced tillage may increase N,O emissions by
favouring higher soil moisture content (Cole et al., 1993;
MacKenzie er al., 1997; Ball et al., 1999), though this effect is
not always observed (e.g., Jacinthe and Dick, 1997; Lemke et

times that of CO, (kg per kg), when calculated over a 100-year

forest products, water protection, and so forth (Makundi, 1997;
Frumhoff et al., 1998; Trexler and Associates, 1998). For agri-
cultural projects the approach is typically tied to the idea that
the carbon-sequestering projects are essentially productivity
enhancing and therefore can be viewed as “no regrets” activi-
ties; these are actions that have benefits in themselves aside
from climate mitigation, which make the project socially desir-

intensification of crop production may maintain higher C
stocks, by leaving more land under natural forest, but addition-

wood previously collected from the fallow period (van
Noordwijk et al., 1997). In some cases, the adoption of C-con-

less intensive tillage may not only favour soil C gains, but also
permits savings in CO, emission from fossil fuel combustion
(Kern and Johnson, 1993). An evaluation of the net benefit of
a C-sequestering practice, therefore, must consider energy use
in addition to changes in C stocks. Whereas the duration of soil
C gain in response to improved management may be finite,
savings in CO, emissions from energy use continue indefinite-

"Management strategies that conserve C in agricultural soils
may have ancillary benefits quite apart from atmospheric CO,
removal. Foremost among these is a favourable effect on soil
productivity. Numerous studies have shown a strong link
between the organic C content of a soil and its quality for crop
production (e.g., Carter et al., 1997; Christensen and Johnston,
1997; Herrick and Wander, 1997). Consequently, a gain in soil
C may promote crop yields, and preserve or enhance future soil
productivity (Cole et al., 1997; Rosenzweig and Hillel, 2000).
For example, application of fertilizers to agro-pastoral systems
in parts of South America may not only induce soil C accumu-
lation, but also enhance agricultural productivity (Fisher et al.,
1997). Many of the practices advocated for soil C conservation
— reduced tillage, more vegetative cover, greater use of peren-
nial crops — also prevent erosion, yielding possible benefits for
improved water and air quality (Cole et al., 1993). As a result
of these benefits, adoption of practices that promote C conser-
vation in agricultural lands is often justified even without the
additional benefits arising from CO, mitigation.

establishing a project to the cumulative carbon sequestered

afforestation projects. However, this approach usually reveals
little about how costs might change if the project were expand-

"Point Estimates: The cost estimates of actually sequestering
carbon obtained in point estimate type of studies tend to be

of more recent point estimate country studies reported most
unit abatement costs in this low range, or lower. The earlier
IPCC estimates for SAR were that of an investment of US$

US$63.6 billion at an overall cost of US$2.4/tC (Sathaye and

that the investment cost of mitigation is generally quite low for

and South Korea (e.g., US$0.10/tC in Vietnam, and US$1- 2/tC

"Partial Equilibrium: Partial equilibrium involves a more com-
plete estimation of a static cost function that estimates rising
costs (e.g., as a result of land price increases as one moves to
lands with higher opportunity costs) associated with increased
sequestration activities. These studies generate marginal cost
functions that tend to suggest most costs are higher than those
of the simple point estimates. This is because, for example, they
include in the cost estimates the opportunity costs of the land,
and they recognize rising costs associated with additional plan-
ning activity and, for some, because they apply a discount rate
to future physical carbon sequestered. The costs for modest
amounts of carbon sequestered in specific areas are generally in
the US$20-US$100/tC range (Moulton and Richards, 1990;
Adams et al., 1995; Parks and Hardie, 1997;Stavins, 1999;
Plantinga et al., 1999). Costs tend to depend on the forest
growth rates anticipated and the opportunity costs of the land.
Where projects are small, land prices would be expected to be
stable. However, in regions where projects are large, land
prices, and hence sequestration costs, will tend to rise.

"Market Equilibrium Models: This approach incorporates sec-
toral and general equilibrium interrelationships. It recognizes
that expanding the forest for carbon sequestration purposes
has implications for current and future industrial forest pro-
duction and prices, and for agricultural production and prices.
These price and production changes then generate feedbacks
through the market to the forest and agricultural sector behav-
iour. Alig et al. (1997), for example, examine the effects on
welfare costs of meeting alternative carbon sequestration tar-
gets by land re-allocations between agriculture and forestry in
the USA. This model explicitly treats agriculture and wood
production as interrelated. Allocating more land to trees to
capture carbon has implications on the price and quantity of
agricultural products, as well as on timber. Thus, the costs of
carbon plantations are found both in the price of establishing
the plantations and in the higher agricultural prices, and thus
involve welfare shifts across sectors. A different approach,
also recognizing sectoral interrelationships, is that of Sedjo
and Sohngen (2000). This approach expands on earlier global
timber supply models by explicitly incorporating the interrela-
tions between the industrial wood sector and carbon planta-
tions by recognizing the joint product nature of industrial
wood and carbon. This approach finds that tree planting car-
bon sequestration activities tend to have a somewhat more
modest effect than anticipated, since the tree planting for car-
bon purposes leads to an expected increase in future timber
supplies and a corresponding decrease in expected future
prices. Through the effects of price expectations on the timber
market, carbon activities may discourage industrial timber
investments and thereby lose some of the carbon gains made
from the initial project. This is a form of leakage not often rec-
ognized.

approaches for mitigating the atmospheric increase of CO,

involving a small and varied group of stakeholders has been
initiated in the terrestrial biosphere. These projects (forest
expansion, forest management, soil carbon management, com-

area of 3.6 to 6.4 million hectares in 1999 (for an overview see

"Agricultural subsidies are common in many, if not most, coun-
tries. Agricultural subsidies and absent forestry subsidy poli-
cies can often be viewed as discouraging forest production and
thus, inadvertently, discouraging some possibilities for carbon
sequestration. Similarly, tax policies can promote or discour-
age certain types of land use. In some countries, however, sub-
sidies do promote afforestation and reforestation. The move-
ment of land from agriculture to forests generally leads to gains
in the forest sector and losses in the agricultural sector. The
cost of any additional carbon storage can involve a change in
welfare across two sectors. Lower taxes for agricultural lands
and subsidies for forest clearing may be part of the package of
instruments to promote development.

"To reach objectives for carbon sequestration, market mecha-
nisms are important, but an appropriate institutional setting is
also useful. In some tropical countries the profitability of main-
taining forests could be improved in order to prevent conver-
sion to alternative uses of the land. Success could entail revis-
ing policies that directly or indirectly subsidize cattle ranching
(as has been historically the case in Latin America) or agricul-
ture. Success in C sequestration could also entail technical and
financial training and capacity building at the local level. It
should be recognized, however, that in many tropical countries,
particularly within Asia and Africa, forests are harvested and
used according to the subsistence needs of local communities.
In these cases, some have argued that approaches based on
market mechanisms will not be effective. Also, non-timber for-
est products are an important component of the total demand
for forest products and could be considered.

"There are a host of market and non-market options to manage
carbon pools in the terrestrial biosphere. Some of the most rel-
evant questions related to carbon sequestration deal with the
types of instruments, policies, and mechanisms that could play
a role in promoting increased sequestration and how the vari-
ous arrangements would actually affect outcomes. Market
mechanisms could be important in promoting or discouraging
carbon sequestration. Potential mechanisms might include
taxes or subsidies for activities that affect carbon directly or
that affect activities with large carbon implications. The UK,
for example, has proposed a “Climate Change Levy” to be
adopted by the UK’s 2001 Budget. The Kyoto Protocol intro-
duces flexible mechanisms allowing joint implementation,
emissions trading, and the clean development mechanism.

"Public, NGO, and private institutions, at each spatial level
where they exist, can focus on including GHG mitigation as
one of their considerations, while they oversee the use of for-

those in tropical countries and elsewhere. For example, a
recent study on sustainable livelihoods and carbon manage-
ment discussed arrangements to facilitate the involvement of
small-scale farmers and rural communities in carbon trading
(Bass et al., 2000). An optimal mix of conservation, sequestra-
tion, and substitution will be incidental or arise from the opti-
mal management of forest resources for producing desired
goods and services as shown under various tropical forest man-
agement stipulations (ITTA, 1983, 1994). In the tropical
biome, the most likely use of the optimal mix of management
strategies will be based on optimal management of forestry and
agricultural resources in each country. For example, balance
between forest conservation, afforestation, reforestation, and
multiple land use of the forest and agricultural areas will pre-
determine the extent of utilization of the land-use sectors for
mitigation activities. However, the existing policies in manag-
ing forest and agricultural resources have been criticized as
non-optimal (see, for example, Poore ef al., 1989). Optimal
levels of substitution will be determined by the energy and
industrial policies of these countries, rather than by carbon

that was to be cleared is instead protected. Protection of one
such forest or wetland may simply deflect the pressure to
another piece of land that is not protected and will be cleared
instead. Leakage can occur across both spatial and temporal
boundaries. Additionally, a forest protected in one year is sub-

the latter part of 2000!). In addition to tradable carbon emis-
sion permits, the door is open for consideration of an analogous
instrument, tradable “carbon offsets”. Activities, such as plant-

services that could be sold or traded.

"A potentially serious problem with carbon offsets is that there
may be carbon leakage. Leakage refers to the situation in
which a carbon sequestration activity (e.g., tree planting) on
one piece of land inadvertently, directly or indirectly, triggers
an activity which, in whole or part, counteracts the carbon
effects of the initial activity. It can be shown that most of these
types of problems arise from differential treatment of carbon in
different regions and circumstances, and the problem is not
unique to carbon sequestration activities but pervades carbon
mitigation activities in the energy sector as well.

carbon sequestration is the tradable emissions permit. Tradable
permits to deal with environmental pollutants have precedents

excess emissions permits can trade these to firms in need of
additional permits. Thus, incremental emissions are no longer

purchase carbon offset credits (Sedjo, 1999a). Another market
approach has been created, the Certified Tradable Offsets,

"Through setting emissions targets and introducing taxes on
CO, emission in some countries, carbon gains monetary value
and could become a new product for the forestry sector. From
existing emissions taxes this value is estimated at
US$200/tCO, in Norway and US$100/tCO, in the Netherlands
(Solberg, 1997; Nabuurs, 1998). In the case of the Netherlands,
this carbon value is equivalent to US$17.5/m3 of roundwood,
more than the stumpage value of wood as a raw material.
However, in the first trades of certified carbon credits, Moura-
Costa and Stuart (1998) found that prices ranged between
US$5-US$10/tC. More generally, Moura-Costa and Stuart
(1998) found that the average price for carbon credits for car-
bon sequestered in developing countries ranged from US$0.19
to US$12/tC, and that these differences are very much linked
to uncertainty about long term policy.

"Markets created for carbon credits from management of the
biosphere, of course, will be heavily influenced by the many
other commodities produced by the biosphere (food, wood,
etc.). Food security may, for example, be a reason for a gov-
ernment to continue its policy of agricultural subsidies in the
absence of forestry (carbon) subsidies. On the other hand,
some studies (e.g., Callaway and McCarl, 1996) have shown
that when diverting agricultural subsidies to carbon payments,
the net impact on the national budget could be zero. In tropical
countries, the institutions and subsidies for forest clearing may
remain as part of the package to promote economic develop-
ment. Only if the monetary value of carbon stocks and sinks is
recognized and paid for will markets be efficient in encourag-
ing C sequestration. Some developing countries see markets
for C offsets as providing resources to facilitate capital inflows
to finance conservation and other activities.

never released. Thus, a carbon-offset credit would be equiva-
lent to a tradable emission credit. However, since carbon off-
set can quickly be liquidated, offset credits have greater liabil-
ity problems. One approach might be treated on an annual (or
decadal) basis as the rental of (perhaps temporary) carbon
sequestering services. Although different from carbon emis-
sions permits, they nevertheless would expand the number of
“credits” available, and thus have a mitigating effect on the
market price of the credits. A discussion of some of the options

"The costs of carbon management may not be distributed in the
same way as the benefits. Carbon management options in
developing countries may have low market costs but high local
social costs in land commitments, and the benefits that arise
may not be shared with local peoples. Analysis of a forest pro-
tection project in Madagascar suggests that there are financial
benefits for local inhabitants and social benefits for the global
community, but short-term debits at the national level (Kremen
et al., 2000). Formal adoption of markets for forest carbon
could increase incentives for forest protection, especially if
mechanisms assure that local peoples share in the benefits.
Similarly, costs and benefits may be realized at different times;
future benefits are often weighted against current costs. How
communities value present and future costs depends on wealth,

"The net primary production of marine ecosystems is roughly
the same as for terrestrial ecosystems (SO0GtC/yr for marine
ecosystems and 60GtC/yr for terrestrial ecosystems), and there
are opportunities to increase the net carbon flow into the
marine biosphere. There are fundamental differences between
the two systems, however, as the marine biosphere does not
include large stores of carbon in the living and dead biomass.
There are some 3 GtC in marine biota versus nearly 2500GtC
in terrestrial vegetation and soils (Table 4.1). The key to
increasing the carbon stocks in ocean ecosystems is thus to
move carbon through the small reservoir of the marine biota to
the larger reservoirs of dissolved inorganic carbon (the “bio-
logical pump”) in ways that will isolate the carbon and prevent
its prompt return to the atmosphere. The biological pump
serves to move carbon from the atmosphere to the deep oceans,
as organisms take up CO, by photosynthesis in the surface

sediments with rising pH occurs in nature, but does so on a
time-scale of thousands of years or more (Archer et al., 1997).
Intentional dissolution of mined minerals has been considered,

opportunities to manage carbon via these processes, and that
the rate of carbon sequestration could be either increased or

"The IronEx 1 experiment showed unequivocally that there was
a biological response to the addition of iron. However,
although plant biomass doubled and phytoplankton production
increased fourfold, the decrease in CO, fugacity (in effect the
partial pressure of CO, decreased by 10 micro atm) was only
about a tenth of that expected (Martin et al., 1994; Watson et

dance and growth rate of phytoplankton increased dramatical-
ly (by greater than 20 and twice, respectively), nitrate
decreased by half, and CO, concentrations were significantly
reduced (the fugacity of CO, was down 90uatm on day 9).
Within a week of the last fertilization, however, the phyto-
plankton bloom had waned, the iron concentration had
decreased below ambient, and there was no sign that the iron

in large quantities, but the quantities to be supplied would be
much smaller if growth were limited by a micronutrient. In par-
ticular, there is evidence that in large areas of the Southern
Ocean productivity is limited by availability of the micronutri-
ent iron. Martin (1990, 1991) suggested that the ocean could be
stimulated to take up additional CO, from the atmosphere by
providing additional iron, and that 300,000 tonnes of iron
could result in the removal of 0.8GtC from the atmosphere.
Other analyses have suggested that the effect may be more lim-
ited. Peng and Broecker (1991) examined the dynamic aspects
of this proposal and concluded that, even if the iron hypothesis
was completely correct, the dynamic issues of mixing the
excess carbon into the deep ocean would limit the magnitude
of the impact on the atmosphere. Joos et al. (1991) reported on
a similar model experiment and found the ocean dynamics to
be less important, the time path of anthropogenic CO, emis-

of iron fertilization to be somewhat greater than reported by

large-scale agriculture, global forestry activities, or fossil fuel

"Teller et al. (1997), because although the system mass would be
less, the scatterers may be much more costly to fabricate.
However, it is unlikely that cost would play an important role in
the decision to deploy such a system. Even if we accept the
higher cost estimates of the NAS (1992) study, the cost may be
very small compared to the cost of other mitigation options
(Schelling, 1996). It is likely that issues of risk, politics
(Bodansky, 1996), and environmental ethics (Jamieson, 1996)
will prove to be the decisive factors in real choices about imple-
mentation. The importance of the novel scattering systems is not
in minimizing cost, but in their potential to minimize risk. Two
of the key problems with earlier proposals were the potential
impact on atmospheric chemistry, and the change in the ratio of
direct to diffuse solar radiation, and the associated whitening of
the visual appearance of the sky. The proposals of Teller e/ al.
(1997) suggest that the location, scattering properties, and
chemical reactivity of the scatterers could, in principle, be tuned
to minimize both of these impacts. Nonetheless, most papers on
geo-engineering contain expressions of concern about unexpect-
ed environmental impacts, our lack of complete understanding
of the systems involved, and concerns with the legal and ethical
implications (NAS, 1992; Flannery et al., 1997; Keith, 2000).
Unlike other strategies, geo-engineering addresses the symp-

"Summaries by Early (1989), NAS (1992), and Flannery ef al.
(1997) consider a variety of ways by which the albedo of the
earth might be increased to try to compensate for an increase in
the concentration of infrared absorbing gases in the atmosphere
(see also Dickinson, 1996). The possibilities include atmos-
pheric aerosols, reflective balloons, and space mirrors. Most
recently, work by Teller et al. (1997) has re-examined the pos-
sibility of optical scattering, either in space or in the stratos-
phere, to alter the earth’s albedo and thus to modulate climate.
The latter work captures the essence of the concept and is
summarized briefly here to provide an example of what is envi-
sioned. In agreement with the 1992 NAS study, Teller ef al.
(1997) found that ~10’ t of dielectric aerosols of ~100 nm
diameter would be sufficient to increase the albedo of the earth
by ~1%. They showed that the required mass of a system based
on alumina particles would be similar to that of a system based
on sulphuric acid aerosol, but the alumina particles offer dif-
ferent environmental impact. In addition, Teller et al. (1997)
demonstrate that use of metallic or optically resonant scatterers
can, in principle, greatly reduce the required total mass of scat-
tering particles required. Two configurations of metal scatter-
ers that were analyzed in detail are mesh microstructures and
micro-balloons. Conductive metal mesh is the most mass-effi-
cient configuration. The thickness of the mesh wires is deter-
mined by the skin-depth of optical radiation in the metal, about
20 nm, and the spacing of wires is determined by the wave-
length of scattered light, about 300nm. In principle, only ~10°t
of such mesh structures are required to achieve the benchmark
1% increase in albedo. The proposed metal balloons have
diameters of ~4 mm and a skin thickness of ~20nm. They are
hydrogen filled and are designed to float at altitudes of ~25km.
The total mass of the balloon system would be ~10°t. Because
of the much longer stratospheric residence time of the balloon
system, the required mass flux (e.g., tonnes replaced per year)
to sustain the two systems would be comparable. Finally, Teller
et al. (1997) show that either system, if fabricated in alumini-
um, can be designed to have long stratospheric lifetimes yet
oxidize rapidly in the troposphere, ensuring that few particles
are deposited on the surface.

because they are too expensive from a societal perspective.

The absence of a market price for certain impacts, such as envi-
ronmental harm, can constitute a barrier to the diffusion of
environmentally beneficial technologies. Distortion of prices
arising from taxes, subsidies, or other policy interventions that
make resource consumption more or less expensive to con-
sumers can also impede the diffusion of resource-conserving
technologies.

"In addition to the market potential, there is also the economic
potential and the socioeconomic potential to be considered.
Eliminating imperfections of markets, public policies, and
other institutions that inhibit the diffusion of technologies that
are (or are projected to be) cost-effective for consumers (eval-
uated using consumers’ private rate of time discounting and
prices) without reference to any GHG benefits they may gen-
erate would increase GHG mitigation to the level defined as
the “economic potential”. The “socioeconomic” potential con-
sists of barriers derived from people’s individual habits, atti-
tudes and social norms, and vested interests in the diffusion of
new technology. This potential represents the level of GHG
mitigation that would be achieved if technologies that are cost
effective from a societal perspective are implemented.

"Technological and social innovation is a complex process of
research, experimentation, learning, and development that can
contribute to GHG mitigation. Several theories and models
have been developed to understand its features, drivers, and
implications. New knowledge and human capital may result
from R&D spending, through learning by doing, and/or in an
evolutionary process. Most innovations require some social or
behavioural change on the part of users. Rapidly changing
economies, as well as social and institutional structures offer
opportunities for locking-in to GHG-mitigative technologies
that may lead countries on to sustainable development path-
ways. The pathways will be influenced by the particular
socioeconomic context that reflects prices, financing, interna-
tional trade, market structure, institutions, the provision of
information, and social, cultural and behavioural factors; key
elements of which are described below.

pered by barriers! that slow their penetration. The opportunity”
to mitigate GHG concentrations by removing or modifying
barriers to the spread of technology may be viewed within a
framework of different potentials for GHG mitigation (Figure
5.1). The “market potential” indicates the amount of GHG mit-
igation that might be achieved under forecast market condi-
tions, with no changes in policy or implementation of measures
whose primary purpose is the mitigation of GHGs. The market
potential can be close to zero as a result of extreme poverty,
absence of markets, and remoteness of communities. The
inability of the poor or isolated communities to access modern
energy services reflects this situation. Because interventions to
address poverty fall outside the immediate scope of this chap-

Subsidies for critical inputs to agriculture, such as fertilizers,
water supply, and electricity and fuels, and to outputs in order
to maintain stable agricultural systems and an equitable distri-
bution of wealth distort markets for these products. In relation
to climate change mitigation, other issues such as lack of tech-

A culture of energy subsidies, institutional inertia, fragmented

barriers to their implementation in the developing countries
and those with economies in transition (EIT). Situations in
these two groups of countries call for a more careful analysis
of trade, institutional, financial, and income barriers and
opportunities; distorted prices and information gaps. In the
developed countries, other barriers such as the current carbon-
intensive lifestyle and consumption patterns, social structures,
network externalities, and misplaced incentives offer opportu-
nities for intervention to control the growth of GHG emissions.
Lastly, new and used technologies mostly flow from the devel-
oped to developing and transitioning countries. A global
approach to reducing emissions that targets technology being

"The chapter focuses not only on the energy demand and supply
sectors, which have a rich literature in this field, but also on the
agriculture, forestry, and waste sectors. In the introductory sec-
tions below, a conceptual framework for understanding the role
of opportunities and barriers, and a review of the two earlier
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports
that have dealt with this topic, namely the Second Assessment
Report (SAR) and the Special Report on Technology Transfer
(SRTT) are presented. Section 5.3 then discusses the generic
opportunities and barriers that apply across all sectors, which
is followed by a discussion of the prominent barriers and
opportunities in appropriate sectors of the economy.

"Technology transfer comprises a broad set of processes cover-
ing the flows of know-how, experience, and equipment for mit-
igating and adapting to climate change among different stake-
holders such as governments, private sector entities, financial
institutions, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and
research and/or education institutions (IPCC, 1996; IPCC,
2000b). The term transfer encompasses diffusion of technolo-
gies and technology co-operation across and within countries.
It comprises the process of learning to understand, utilize, and
replicate the technology, including the capacity to choose and
adapt it to local conditions, and integrate it with indigenous
technologies.

"An element that lies largely unexplored is the connection
between poverty and climate change mitigation. A large pro-
portion of the world’s population lives in poverty, often outside
a cash economy, and does not have access to modern fuels.
Even when the poor are part of a cash economy, they are often
deprived of access to financial instruments that require collat-
eral. The literature on barriers and opportunities to address
their need for fuels, and the consequent GHG emissions, is rel-
atively sparse. In this chapter, the limited material on barriers,
opportunities, and interventions associated with the provision
of energy services to the poor is reviewed primarily in the sec-
tions on finance (Section 5.3.3), energy use in buildings
(Section 5.4.1) and agriculture (Section 5.4.5).

"Opportunities for climate change mitigation exist both in
reducing the intensity of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and
the level of activities that cause these emissions. Reducing the
level of an activity, for instance vehicle travel, need not reduce
the services associated with it if a substitute like telecommut-
ing can satisfy the same need. GHG mitigation can thus be
achieved without sacrificing consumer welfare. Opportunities
for such changes are equally important and need to be actively
sought out. The interventions needed for achieving changes in
the level of activity, however, can encompass the broad array
of macro and micro policies that affect consumers and produc-
ers alike. In this chapter, the barriers, opportunities, and sec-
toral interventions for both the GHG intensity and “activity”
changes are discussed. The broader macro-interventions are
discussed in Chapter 6.
"	Text
"The previous chapters (Chapters 3 and 4) have discussed the
characteristics of different technologies and practices, and
their potential and costs for the mitigation of climate change.
Chapter 3 has identified numerous negative cost or “no
regrets” options whose full implementation is prevented by
various types of barriers. The focus of this chapter, thus, is on
the various barriers that inhibit the process of technology
transfer, but not on technology programmes, which are cov-
ered in Chapter 3. A “barrier” is any obstacle to reaching a
potential that can be overcome by a policy, programme, or
measure (Figure 5.1). This chapter describes the barriers that
lie below the “socioeconomic potential” line in Figure 5.1.
Barriers to technology transfer may also be viewed as oppor-
tunities for intervention by the aforementioned stakeholders so
that technologies can reach their full potential. An “opportuni-
ty” is thus any situation or circumstance to decrease the gap
between the “market potential” of a technology and the eco-
nomic, socioeconomic, or technical potential. Barriers and
opportunities tend to be context-specific, and can change over
time and vary across countries. Policies, programmes, and
measures may be used to take advantage of the opportunities
to help overcome the barriers. The interventions are largely
described and assessed in Chapter 6, although some types of
interventions at the sectoral level are illustrated in Section 5.4
of this chapter.

"Barriers to technology transfer have been described and classi-
fied in many different ways. Reddy (1991) classifies barriers
by actors, consumers, energy providers, etc.; and others (Hirst
and Brown, 1990; Evans, 1991; Hirst, 1992) by the type of bar-
rier, financing, pricing, etc. Technological and social changes
offer new opportunities for the diffusion of GHG-mitigative
technologies. Rapidly changing economies and institutional
and social structures offer opportunities for locking into GHG-
mitigative technologies that are likely to grow over the long
term. Exploiting opportunities during a period of rapid change
is typically easier than in a static environment. For example,
the Internet revolution means that many aspects of society and
the economy are being reshaped, offering opportunities to
build environmental and sustainable development practices
into the emerging paradigms. At the more micro-level, the
beginning of an investment cycle for power supply systems
and house purchase by individuals and families is a period
when they are making major purchase decisions. Governments
can influence these decisions through various regulations,
financial incentives and information at such times to make the
new investment less-GHG intensive. Synergies exist between
GHG mitigation and other policy goals, e.g., reducing transport
air pollution or conserving soils. Measures to address the latter
offer opportunities for GHG mitigation also. While the chapter
focuses broadly on both barriers and opportunities, Sections
5.3.1 and 5.3.8 specifically review the models of, and experi-
ence with, technological and social innovation and the oppor-
tunities offered for the diffusion of GHG-mitigative technolo-
gies. Synergies too are noted throughout, but particularly so in
the sectoral sections 5.4.4 through 5.4.7.

Studies of implicit discount r: rates have shown that households
and firms behave as if they use rates substantially above the
market rate for long-term government bonds. Firms use dis-
count rates that reflect the riskiness of projects, and, as a result
of imperfect information, households and firms often face
rationing in capital markets for credit and equity. Economists
emphasize that timing, risk, capital constraints, and informa-
tion or lack thereof should be dealt with separately. A discount
rate should reflect investment timing questions, risk should be
treated by converting costs and benefits into certainty equiva-
lents, and shadow pricing should address constraints on capi-
tal. Lack of information could be addressed through govern-
ment intervention (see Sections 5.3.3 for further discussion on

"The topic of barriers to the market penetration of environmen-
tally sound technologies (ESTs) was treated in Section 1.5.3
(“Market failures and government responses”) of the Working
Group (WG) III SAR, and also in Chapter 8, Sections 8.2.3
(“Key factors affecting the magnitude of costs: Costs as a func-
tion of baselines and policy strategies’), and 8.4.3 (“The top-
down vs. bottom-up modelling controversy: Some lessons
from the energy field’) respectively. The latter sections dealt
with the discussion of the differences between top-down and
bottom-up modelling when estimating the costs of strategies to
reduce or control GHG emissions. The primary question raised
in the discussion in the SAR may be summarized as: Given
market prices, do firms fail to take advantage of all the energy
efficiency opportunities available to them? Thus, a business
investment decision, considering private costs, may not under-
take all the available efficiency opportunities. Likewise, in the
modelling sections, the discussion focused on the existence of
the “no regrets” potential. Its existence implies that (1) market
and/or institutional failures exist, and (2) cost-effective policies
targeted to correct these can be identified and implemented.
The SAR notes four categories of market imperfections that
explain the above phenomena, and the policies that could be
used to address them. A more detailed discussion of these top-
ics is included in other sections of this chapter.

"Of course, elimination of all of these market and institutional
barriers would not produce technology diffusion at the level of
the technical potential. The remaining barriers, which define
the gap between economic potential and technical potential,
are usefully placed in two groups separated by a socioeconom-
ic potential. The first group consists of barriers derived from
people’s preferences and other social and cultural barriers to
the diffusion of new technology. That is, even if market and
institutional barriers are removed, some GHG-mitigating tech-
nologies may not be widely used simply because people do not
like them, are too poor to afford them, or because existing
social and cultural forces operate against their acceptance. If,
in addition to overcoming market and institutional barriers, this
second group of barriers could be overcome, the “socioeco-
nomic potential” would be achieved. Thus, the socioeconomic
potential represents the level of GHG mitigation that would be
achieved if all technologies that are cost effective (on the basis

high private discount rates they believe are appropriate to this
kind of investment render the savings too small to justify the
high up-front cost. If, in addition to overcoming market and
institutional imperfections, these aspects of consumer prefer-

could be achieved without policy intervention (market poten-

ties that separate each of the levels is necessary in order to for-
mulate policy responses to overcome the barriers. The barriers
to the achievement of economic potential are market and other
institutional failures in the markets for technology, and gov-

"The technical potential can be illustrated with reference to the
fuel cell as a power source for private vehicles. Current fuel
cell technology, making use of hydrogen manufactured from
natural gas, can offer GHG emission reductions of around
50%-60% relative to conventional vehicles. This gives some
indication of the current technical potential for mitigation. It is
imaginable that in the future, fuel cell vehicles using hydrogen
or other fuels from non-fossil sources would have even lower
GHG emissions, on a full fuel cycle basis (Michaelis, 1997c).
Thus, the technical potential of fuel cells for GHG mitigation
is significant, and is expected to improve over time, as shown
in Figure 5.1, through scientific discovery and technological
development. However, the Energy Technology Support Unit
(ETSU, 1994) notes numerous challenges that would have to
be overcome before such vehicles could enter widespread use
and offer more substantial emission reductions. In other words,
the current market potential is very small at best. The large gap
between the market and technical potentials (at the present
time) can be understood in terms of specific barriers. Some of
these relate to technology performance and cost, while others
have to do with fitting non-fossil fuels into the existing infra-
structure. The need to improve the cost and performance of the
technology would represent barriers separating the technical
and socioeconomic potentials. To the extent that the diffusion
of cost-effective fuel cells is or will be limited by rigidities in
the existing infrastructure, these could be considered barriers
separating the economic and socioeconomic potentials for this
technology.

the cost and performance of the technologies. These can be
improved upon by solving scientific and technological prob-

aimed at fostering the research and development (R&D)
process, either in the public or private sectors. In addition,
because production costs typically fall as experience with a par-
ticular technology accumulates, policies that foster adoption of
new technologies can, over time, produce cost reductions and
performance improvements. The effect of such improvements
would be to make the technologies more cost-effective and con-
sumer-favoured, thus moving both the economic and socioeco-
nomic potentials towards the level of the technical potential.

"Many governments and firms have focused their strategies for
GHG mitigation on encouraging technological innovation —
various processes of research, experimentation, learning, and
technology development. Innovation may lead to improve-
ments in technology performance, reductions in GHG emis-
sions per unit of service provided, or reductions in cost for low-
GHG technology, all of which can contribute to GHG mitiga-
tion. Innovation can help to raise the technological, socio-polit-
ical, economic, and market potentials for adoption of low-
GHG technology, and for GHG mitigation. Identifying the bar-
riers to, and opportunities for, technological innovation
depends on understanding the innovation process. Since the
IPCC SAR, there has been a rapid growth of interest in the the-

"As a prelude to the more detailed sectoral discussion in Section
5.4, this section provides a general overview of the process of
technological innovation, and the different sources of barriers
to the diffusion of new technology and practices, as well as the
policy opportunities that they represent. This section is orga-
nized by the following categories: prices, financing, trade and
environment, market structure, institutional frameworks, infor-
mation provision; and social, cultural and behavioural norms
and aspirations. Within each of these areas, some of the barri-
ers represent failures or imperfections in markets, policies, or
other institutions that lie between the status-quo of the market
potential and the possible achievement of the economic poten-
tial. Other barriers are aspects of institutions or social and cul-
tural systems that economists may not characterize as market
imperfections, but which nonetheless limit diffusion of GHG-
efficient technology. These latter barriers separate the econom-
ic and socioeconomic potentials. Within each of the subsec-

"Barriers to climate change mitigation are inherent to the
process of development. Sustainable development in a partici-
patory framework can minimize these barriers, but the
inequitable distribution of income and wealth forms a core fea-
ture of barriers to effective implementation of any type of inter-
vention, and those related to climate change are no exception.
The poor in any society bear a disproportionate burden of the
impact of externalities. Climate change affects them more,
because they often lack the infrastructure to withstand its
impacts. The poor also pay more as a proportion of their
income for energy services, and often tend to use traditional
fuels secured outside the formal market system. They are not
able to access subsidized fuels for instance, because they do
not have the collateral to access these fuels and the equipment
to use them. Appropriate ways of financing would be one way
to overcome such barriers, provided they explicitly account for
the non-existence of markets for some segments of society. The
issue of segmentation is valid for firms as well. Small and
medium-sized firms for instance face information and market-
structure barriers that well-structured large firms can readily
overcome with the resources at their disposal.

technology and can also be viewed as “human capital”.
Increasing capital, again, tends to feed into higher levels of
economic output and improved efficiency. Sometimes this may
contribute to GHG mitigation, but more often the improvement
is in labour productivity, leading to increases in GHG emis-
sions. In so-called “new growth” theory economic models
(e.g., Grossman and Helpman, 1991, 1993), new knowledge
may be assumed to result directly from R&D spending which,
in turn, can be modelled as a result of the expected returns from
the investment. In this framework, firms and research institutes
are treated as rational investors in R&D. The size of their
investment will depend on the opportunity cost of capital and
the expected return from R&D. While new growth theory has
generated useful insights into the sources of national differ-
ences in competitiveness at an aggregate or sectoral level, it is
less useful for describing technology innovation for GHG mit-

"Technological change can take many different forms including:
(1) incremental improvements in existing technology; (2) rad-
ical innovation to introduce completely new technology; (3)
changes in a system of linked technologies, and (4) changes in
the “techno-economic paradigm” involving widespread re-
organization of production and consumption patterns (Freeman
and Perez, 1988). These four types of innovation have different
dynamics. Thus, the first type is likely to occur continually
through the accumulation of experience, selection of success-
ful techniques and adaptation to a changing economic, legisla-
tive and socio-cultural context. The second and third types of
technological change involve more positive creativity, being
linked to new information in the form of a discovery, idea, or
invention; or to a creative application of an existing invention.
The fourth type, again, involves creativity but, because it
involves a radical change in culture and markets, may also
depend on these being “ripe” for change — on a general per-
ception of a major challenge requiring a radical response.

"One of the most obvious barriers to using innovation to address
GHG emissions is the lack of incentives. Economic, regulato-

act as incentives for innovation to find new means of mitiga-

nological change in general and tends to skew it in particular
directions, is that posed by “lock-in” (see Box 5.1). The ten-
dency for societies to lock in to particular clusters of technolo-
gies and patterns of development can prevent new, low-GHG
emission technologies entering the market. Meanwhile, it is
important to recognize when previously locked-in technology
is beginning to change, so that the opportunity can be grasped
to introduce low-emission technology.

"In many cases, a given technology helps to satisfy several different types of need. This is particularly evident in two of the most sig-
nificant areas of energy use: cars and houses. Any individual may have a variety of potentially conflicting objectives when choosing
a technology. This tendency of successful technologies to serve multiple needs contributes to lock-in by making it harder for compet-
ing innovations to replace them fully. Hence, many government attempts to introduce new, energy efficient or alternative fuel tech-
nology, especially in the case of the car, have failed because of a failure to meet all the needs satisfied by the incumbent technology.
If alternative fuel vehicles have difficulty entering a market dominated by gasoline cars, alternatives to the car face even greater bar-
riers. Owners have learned to associate their cars not only with personal mobility, but also with freedom, flexibility, fun, status, safe-
ty, a personal territory, and perhaps most powerful of all, a means of self-expression. Different owners may place emphasis on differ-
ent needs. To succeed without some form of enforcement, any replacement must satisfy at least several of these needs better than the
existing technology.

"Schumpeter (1928) emphasized the effectiveness of the capitalist system in encouraging experiments and in selecting successes. This
effectiveness can be ascribed partly to the capitalist’s ability to invest in risky endeavours, trading off uncertainty against the size of
the anticipated return. The competitive market system also introduces the element of “creative destruction” to the innovation process,
analogous to natural selection, ensuring that an innovation that does not meet the needs of the market does not survive. Yet, despite
their ability to select adequate technologies, markets sometimes “lock-in” to technologies and practices that are suboptimal because
of increasing returns to scale, which block out any alternatives (Arthur, 1988, 1994). The QWERTY English keyboard layout is often
mentioned as an example of an inefficient technology designed to solve a specific problem (to avoid keys sticking in mechanical type-
writers) but which has become “locked in” (David, 1985). It has been claimed that alternative keyboard designs could double typing
speeds, but these are not adopted because of the retraining costs that would be necessary for any change. Lock-in phenomena are famil-
iar in the energy sector, with technologies and design standards in applications ranging from power stations to light bulbs and urban

accumulate physical capital. More investment in consultation
and participation of the local population in decision making
about GHG mitigation technologies contribute both to infor-

consumers to adopt environmentally sustainable technologies
and practices. Where an adequate legal framework exists, it
should be possible in principle for those suffering the effects of
pollution or climate change to seek compensation from those
responsible. In practice, markets in environmental and social
damages function poorly, if at all, because transaction costs

text can also provide opportunities for innovation. For exam-
ple, the need to address local pollution through government
regulations may stimulate innovation that can contribute to
GHG mitigation. Porter and Van der Linde (1995a) argued that
environmental regulation of industries could also promote their
competitiveness through accelerated innovation, although this
has been disputed by Palmer et al. (1995), who argues that
most evidence is that regulation, as historically practised, has
not fostered competitiveness, and has encouraged innovation

“green” financial products (e.g., energy-efficiency loans). To
bear these costs is often perceived risky by the bankers, given
uncertain and policy-dependent future market conditions.
Relatively low capital requirements and the long-term cash-

high transaction costs of servicing large numbers of small and
medium-sized projects, further reduce comparative attractive-

"Where environmental and social costs are not reflected in mar-
kets (i.e., they are externalities), there are many ways in which
governments can internalize them, notably through environ-
mental regulations and taxes. However, governments have to
balance a large number of objectives and the outcome may not
be efficient in linking resource prices to GHG emissions. A
variety of different types of government policy tend to reduce
prices, in addition to the direct budgetary subsidies that are
often introduced to support employment in particular sectors or
to enable the poor to meet basic energy needs (OECD, 1997b).
Examples include policies requiring electric utilities to provide
universal, low-priced access to grid systems or even to main-
tain supplies when consumers fail to pay their bills (EBRD,
1999; World Bank, 1999). In India, electricity has historically
been subsidized for residential consumers, serving as a disin-
centive for the adoption of efficient lighting and appliances
(Alam et al., 1998). When energy subsidies are reformed or
removed, transitional or permanent supports are often required
for some of the former recipients (OECD, 1997b). For exam-
ple, in Russia, the introduction of long-run marginal cost elec-
tricity pricing has led to pensioners being unable to afford their
electricity bills, requiring support that amounts to 20%-35% of
local authority budgets (Gritsevich, 2000).

"Many environmentally beneficial technologies require signifi-
cant “up-front” investment. This investment will be typically
offset, over time, by the environmental benefits, out-of-pocket
cost savings, or financial revenues associated with the new
technology. There are, however, many circumstances where
users are unable to purchase equipment that is financially
viable to them or beneficial to the society, simply because they
do not have access to the private or government investment
funds necessary to install the equipment. To the extent that pri-
vate entities are not willing to provide funds to implement
investments that are financially viable and in addition reduce
GHG emissions, they constitute failures of capital and finan-
cial markets that must be overcome to reach the level of eco-
nomic potential. In contrast to private financiers, who are pri-
marily concerned about the risk-adjusted financial return, gov-
ernments are expected to evaluate desirability of investments
in a wider context of the well-being of the whole society,
including harms and benefits that some entities impose on oth-
ers. To the extent that governments are not willing to finance
investments that are socially desirable thanks to climate and
other environmental benefits, they constitute policy failures
that prevents achievement of socioeconomic potential. All
these market and policy failures are aggravated in developing
countries and low income transition economies, where they
interact with poverty and capital constraints.

"Different energy producers and consumers have varying access
to capital in financial markets, and at different rates of interest.
In general, energy suppliers can obtain capital at lower interest
rates than can energy consumers — thus, an “interest rate gap”.
Differences in these borrowing rates may reflect differences in
the knowledge base of lenders about the likely performance of
investments, as well as the financial risk of the potential bor-
rower. At one extreme, electric and gas utilities are able to bor-
row money at low interest rates. At the other extreme, low-
income households may have essentially no ability to borrow
funds, resulting in an essentially infinite discount rate for valu-
ing improvements in energy efficiency. The broader market for
energy efficiency (including residential, commercial, and
industrial consumers) faces interest rates available for efficien-
cy purchases that are also much higher than the utility cost of
capital (Hauseman, 1979; Ruderman et al., 1987; Ross, 1990).

a contracts with owners to recuperate the return (WB and IFC,

upon the long-term market growth prospects for the environ-

on the consistent and clear commitment by governments to cli-

Central governments can foster the use of economic instru-

while generating budgetary revenues (Herber, 1997;
Schlegelmilch, 1999). In the area of biodiversity pricing,
instruments can result in a “double dividend”. They can pre-
vent the “tragedy of the commons” by limiting otherwise open
access to vulnerable natural reserves. Prices also generate rev-

fiscal policy and a macroeconomic environment. This leads to
high interest rates, elevated inflationary expectations, and fluc-

usually induces low liquidity in the enterprise and banking sec-

by obstacles to trade and bank credit, barriers to entry, espe-

being competitive and efficient in using resources, but rather
for “seeking rents” through friendly and not transparent rela-

to the import of inexpensive energy-intensive and highly-pol-

refuelled, the attractiveness of vehicles using alternative fuels is
very dependent on the availability of convenient sites for refu-

devoted to distributing any given fuel is, in turn, dependent on
there being sufficient vehicles using that fuel to generate a large
demand for that infrastructure. This need to create an interacting
network of equipment and infrastructure can be a barrier to the

Beers et al., 1997). This lack of empirical relationship is
caused by two reasons. First, it is most cost effective to use the
same technology everywhere and, therefore, to operate every-
where according to the most stringent environmental regula-
tions (Levinson, 1994). Second, the industry cost of environ-
mental regulation is too small relative to other costs, such as
labour, to weigh heavily in location decisions (Dean, 1992;
Jaffe et al. 1995; Markusen, 1999; Steininger, 1999). In partic-

advantage lies in less-polluting labor-intensive sectors, and
weak environmental standards often go hand in hand with
other factors that deter investment such as social capital weak-

"There is also little evidence, both on theoretical and empirical
grounds, of a “race to the bottom” when other countries use
environmental standards to retaliate against trade measures. A
globally optimal solution remains a combination of free-trade
and co-operative environmental policies. This does not mean
that, as environmental resources become scarcer, free trade
may not generate negative environmental impacts under some
circumstances as suggested by theoretical models (Copeland
and Taylor, 1994; 1995). Little is known both theoretically and
empirically about the links among trade, environment, and
innovation (Carraro, 1994, Steininger, 1999). There is also lit-
tle evidence, both theoretical and empirical, in favour of the
Porter Hypothesis that stronger environmental regulation cre-
ates a long-term technological advantage (Jaffe, 1995; Ulph,
1997). Regulatory capture through which interest groups striv-
ing for protection against foreign competition lobby against
environmental standards and for environmental tariffs is a pos-
sible barrier to diffusion of technology. Capture is less likely
under a market-based instrument approach to environmental
policy, which regulates polluting substances than under a com-
mand-and-control one, which regulates polluters. This is
because the former raises the cost of lobbying and decreases
the agency problem as the regulated group is larger and more
heterogeneous under the former regime than under the latter
and has no incentive to hide information from the regulator
(Rauscher, 1999). Many international environmental agree-
ments allow for trade sanctions. Though, in a less than efficient
world, trade sanctions for environmental violations can be jus-
tified, the latter are discriminatory and may jeopardize diffu-
sion of required technologies (Rauscher, 1999).

maintain or expand market share and production capacity) may
cause the firm to reject cost-effective GHG-efficiency invest-
ment opportunities. Where energy costs are a small component
of total production costs, management may not provide suffi-
cient support for energy efficiency investments. In addition,
within a firm, no single party or department may have clear and
explicit responsibility for managing energy costs.

"Another facet of behaviour that is often cited as a barrier to
energy efficiency investments is the demand for a rapid pay-
back that may be either explicit or implicit in behaviour. To
some degree, the so-called high discount rate applied by con-
sumers could be seen as an aspect of “irrational” behaviour.
However, the demand for a rapid payback is also related to par-
ticular features of energy-efficient products or services (such as
uncertain performance), specific circumstances related to
home and appliance ownership, the context in which these
products are placed, or to macro-economic conditions, such as
high inflation or uncertain future energy prices.

institutions are systems of rules, decision-making procedures,
and programmes that give rise to social practices, assign roles
to participants in these practices, and guide their interactions.
Organizations may administer institutions (Young, 1994).
Institutions exhibit substantial continuity and offer narrow and
infrequent windows of opportunity for reform (Aghion and
Howitt, 1998; Rip et al., 1998). Institutions operate in larger
settings characterized by material conditions such as the nature
of available technologies and the distribution of wealth, by
cognitive conditions such as prevailing values, norms, and
beliefs, and by transaction costs, costs of co-ordination, laws,
etc. (Young, 1994; Coase, 1998). The market is a “set of insti-
tutions, expectations, and patterns of behaviour that enable vol-
untary exchanges” based on the willingness to pay of the par-
ties to the exchange (Haddad, 2000). One major concern of the
new institutional economics is the boundary between the mar-
ket on which transactions are negotiated and organizations
such as the firm (Simon, 1991).
"	Text
"Institutions are a form of capital, social capital (Coleman, 1988).
Social capital, like natural and human capital, is at the same time
an input and an amenity. As an input, it enhances the benefits of
investments in other factors and, thereby, shares the “shift” fea-
ture of technology (World Bank, 1997). Social capital is a pub-
lic good and suffers, therefore, from underinvestment.
Generally, weaknesses in social capital resulting from prevailing
beliefs, norms, and values are an important generic barrier to the
effectiveness of institutions. At the microeconomic level, social
capital may be viewed as a social network, and as associated
norms which may improve the functioning of markets and the
productivity of the community for the benefit of the members of
the association (Coleman, 1988; Putnam, 1993; World Bank,
1997; Young, 1999). At the macroeconomic level, social capital
includes the political regime, the legal frameworks, and the gov-
emment’s role in the organization of production in order to
improve macroeconomic performance as well as market effi-
ciency (Olson, 1982; North, 1990). Institutions may remedy
market failures due to asymmetric information through informa-
tion sharing (Shah, 1991). Societies in which trust and civic co-
operation are strong, a component of social capital, have signif-
icant positive impact on productivity and provide stronger
incentives to innovate and to accumulate physical capital. Trust
and civic co-operation tend to affect human capital productivity
especially (Knack and Keefer, 1997).

is in rental housing where the tenant is responsible for the ener-

energy efficiency improvements or acquire more efficient
equipment. Other examples of misplaced incentives are present
in contracts which pay fees to architects and technical advisors

Climate change uncertainties inhibit desirable investment in
new technologies and long-term capital goods. The resulting
uncertainty about energy prices, especially in the short-term,
seems to be an important barrier. Therefore, policy uncertainty
should not add to the incentive of holding off relatively irre-
versible investments. Policy stability is a virtue and institutions
are patterns of routinized behaviour that stabilize perceptions,
interpretations, and justifications (Giddens, 1984; O’ Riordan
et al., 1998; Schmalensee, 1998). Lack of credibility of tech-
nology forcing policy is a form of policy uncertainty as is illus-
trated by the example of the 1970 US automobile emissions
standards (Box 5.2) (Rip and Kemp, 1998). Another form of
policy uncertainty results from a crisis by crisis government
management style, or from the fact that issues are sometimes
championed by individuals and die off when these individuals
leave the political scene.

"Federal controls on US automotive air pollution (carbon monoxide, oxides of hydrogen, and hydrocarbons), inspired by a technology
forcing philosophy, were first applied to 1968 model cars in the US. In the following years, the standards were gradually made more
stringent (White, 1982). The 1970 Clean Air Act imposed stringent nationally uniform emission limitations on new motor vehicles
requiring 90% reductions over uncontrolled emissions by 1975-1976 with fines of up to US$10,000 per car and limited provision for
deadline extensions. The ambitious standards established proved to be difficult to achieve. By 1976, it became clear that many air qual-
ity areas were not going to meet the deadline for implementing the ambient standards (Ashford ef al., 1985). The deadlines for achiev-
ing 90% reduction were repeatedly waived or statutorily postponed. The $10,000 fine was not credible (Stewart, 1981). The Clean Air
Act was amended in 1977, and moved away from technology forcing by introducing market incentives such as innovation waivers
(Ashford ef al., 1985). Empirical results show, however, with very little ambiguity, significantly lower emissions from vehicles for
1968 and after, especially for the years in which emissions were tightened (White, 1982). Therefore, compliance was achieved despite
the fact that industry argued, or that compliance with the regulation was doubtful or thought to be impossible. Rapid diffusion of add-
on catalysts and minor modifications to the standard combustion engine were achieved but basic changes in engine technologies did
not materialize. Uncertainty about whether a deadline or a fine will be enforced gives the signal to industry that a technology devel-
oped may ultimately not be needed, and that adopting low-risk existing technologies i.e., technology diffusion is the way to go
(Stewart, 1981; Ashford et al., 1985).

Many developing countries have excellent constitutional and

adoption of clean technologies (Blackman and Bannister,

to lie in the existence of vested interests among economic

riers, and regulations in order to delay or even prevent the
arrival of new innovations that might destroy their rents
(Olson, 1982). The duration of the delay will depend in part on
the design of political institutions and in part on technological
characteristics (learning by doing and knowledge externali-
ties), and on the balance of power between innovators and
incumbents. The more learning by doing and the more positive
knowledge externalities on the older technology, other things

"Firms’ institutional structures shape their responses to techno-
logical opportunities and policies. Firms that tend to maximize
stability and tend to rely on single-source internal analyses for
information are the least likely to be first adopters of a new
technology. On the other hand, firms that maximize profitabil-
ity, and rely on multiple internal and external sources of infor-
mation were most likely to experiment with a variety of tech-
nologies, but unlikely to commit themselves to a single fuel or
process (Braid et al., 1986; O’Riordan et al., 1998). A vertical-
ly integrated firm may be slower to absorb information and
respond to change than a firm where lateral transfers are possi-
ble (“smart workplaces”). An integrated firm also has less
incentive to innovate than a decentralized one (“Arrow
replacement effect’). On the other hand, as a lot of climate
change innovation research is of an applied nature, research is
more productive when it is carried out by the firm itself than
when delegated to a research institution. Delegation of the
research function to a specific entity within the firm increases
the incentive to acquire information, but also increases the
probability of getting a suboptimal innovation (Aghion and
Howitt, 1998; DeCanio, 1998).

One of the mechanisms for the transmission of both generic
information and application-specific information may be the
process of technology adoption itself. That is, one way that a
user learns about a new technology is by seeing it used or com-
municating with other agents that have used it. In this case, the
adoption of the new technology by a given user creates a posi-
tive information externality, by lowering the cost for others to
acquire useful information. This implies that the act of adop-
tion has social benefits that exceed its private benefits, and
hence will be inadequately undertaken by private agents.

of “misplaced incentives” in the previous paragraph and previ-

GHG mitigation strategies is that, for most people, neither
energy saving nor GHG mitigation is a high priority (see for

contractors who build for others, and tenant-landlord situations
where investments are made by the landlord that reduce a ten-

energy savings that resulted from its installation, since usage
patterns and outside influences such as weather may have
changed. Knowing that this uncertainty will prevail can itself
inhibit technology diffusion, as internal or external advocates
for a new technology may doubt that they will be able to justi-

"Conventional policy development is based on a model of
human motivation that has been widely criticized (Stern, 1986;
Jacobs, 1997; Jaeger et al., 1998). People are assumed to be
rational welfare-maximizers and to have fixed values, which,
along with the information and means available to them, deter-
mine their behaviour. Practical analysis of energy efficiency
and other GHG mitigation options often makes the narrower
assumption that people are cost-minimizers (Komor and
Wiggins, 1988). Such assumptions are undermined by experi-
ence with energy efficiency programmes. It has long been rec-
ognized that consumers do not necessarily act on their stated
values (Maloney and Ward, 1973; Verhallen and van Raaij,
1981), and fail to take up measures that appear on paper to be
economically worthwhile (Stern, 1986; Komor and Wiggins,
1988). Some of the reasons, such as energy price uncertainty
and transaction costs, have been discussed elsewhere in this
chapter and are consistent with the conventional view of con-
sumers as “rational actors”. Another important influence on
behaviour is the source and quality of information on mitiga-

ed more than the advice of industry, retail sales staff or gov-
ernment) (Anderson and Claxton, 1982; Stern, 1986; Komor

paradigm” to accommodate features of human behaviour such
as the gap between attitudes and action, the tendency to adopt
behavioural routines rather than to optimize continually the
limited number of variables that individuals typically take into
account in their choices, and the tendency for people to ratio-

Absolute levels of material wealth are relatively unimportant:

community they live in. While the good life is to some extent
subjective, it is also socially defined. Some aspects of energy-

important roles in culture-specific ideals of the good life, vary-

cultural significance of lighting and heating in Norway, and of

these areas would need to be very sensitive to cultural require-

"Moisander (1998) describes how motivation is shaped by both
broad values and attitudes, and by more specific priorities, and

of public attitudes in the United States find an increasing level
of concern about climate change, and agreement that action is
needed to save energy and protect the environment (Kempton

need to reconcile divergent objectives. This is all the more dif-

mentally friendly behaviour. But identity (as a “green con-
sumer”) and internalized moral ideals or imperatives play a
much stronger role. Identity and ethics, which play an impor-

"Ongoing developments in the media and communication tech-

mitigation. Many scenarios have been painted of the potential
impacts of information and communication technology on
society. The growth of Internet usage and other interactive
communication forms are widely expected to stimulate eco-
nomic development and technological innovation (Cairncross,
1997). However, they may also lead to increased social strati-
fication, social exclusion, and a decline in trust and social sol-
idarity (or social capital) (Castells, 1998). Such developments
could have major implications for the feasibility of responding
collectively to threats such as climate change. Fukuyama
(1999) argues that, although social capital has declined in
recent decades with the development of the information soci-
ety, similar declines occurred during previous economic and
technological upheavals and were followed by the creation of
new institutions, leading to new heights of morality and social
solidarity. Cairncross (1997) even suggests that free communi-

development of personal web pages as a new, versatile, and

"Some argue that, with urbanization, conspicuous consumption
may have become more important as a form of status display —
in small, close-knit communities it is unnecessary because
everybody knows each other (Kempton and Layne, 1994). The
status and group membership function of consumption has also
been altered with the spread of television. Some viewers expe-
rience emotional attachments to TV characters as if they were
real people; viewers also use the characters and situations they
see as reference points for their own lives, helping to shape and
reinforce their own values and identities (McQuail et al.,
1972). Those who watch a large amount of television increas-
ingly compare themselves with the portrayed lifestyles of the
super-rich, resulting in higher desired levels of consumption
(Schor, 1998). While the media can pose a barrier to GHG mit-
igation by reinforcing current trends towards more GHG-inten-
sive lifestyles, it may also offer opportunities. Raising aware-
ness among media professionals of the need for GHG mitiga-
tion and the role of the media in shaping lifestyles and aspira-
tions could be an effective way to encourage a wider cultural
shift. The role of the media in GHG mitigation will be dis-
cussed further in the next section.

"The spread of new communication technology may make it
increasingly difficult for governments to exert a direct influ-

ernments, along with the business community and NGOs, con-
tinue to have a substantial presence in the media and they all
contribute to the shaping of the public discourse on climate
change (see Box 5.3). Some of the essential features of that dis-
course are the differing views on the risks and uncertainties
associated with GHG emissions; the costs and benefits of GHG
mitigation; the allocation of blame for past and current emis-
sions; and the rights of the victims of climate change to com-
pensation. Disagreement on these various points poses an
important barrier to GHG mitigation, especially where media
presentation tends to emphasize controversy. There are many
ways of helping to build of a common discourse, or narrative,
about climate change, involving the various players taking all
available opportunities to meet, discuss, and work together for
common goals. An important example is the growing develop-
ment of partnerships between transnational companies and
environmental NGOs, for example, to develop accreditation
schemes for green products or to design environmental strate-
gies.

"In addition to the perceived conflict with improving material
wellbeing, ethical arguments for GHG mitigation face several
barriers including the perceived weakness of the evidence that
climate change is happening; the difficulty in understanding
the risks associated with low-probability extreme weather
events; the difficulty in tracing climate change impacts to par-
ticular emitters of GHGs; and the large physical and social dis-
tance between GHG emitters and victims of climate change
(Pawlik, 1991). It seems that people are inclined to deny and
remain passive about about those kinds of environmental nui-
sances and risks that they believe to be uncontrollable (Pawlik,
1990). From an institutional perspective, the “commons”
dilemma charaterizes situations in which people are unable to
co-operate to achieve collective benefits, because they are
unable to change the rules affecting their perverse incentives;
these incentives are themselves institution-dependent (Ostrom,
1990; Ostrom ef al., 1993). Current climate may be seen as an
infrastructure which is used jointly by many people, which is
subject to many decision makers, including some in the public
sector, and whose benefits and costs are perceived differently
by different people because these are borne by many people
who do not take the protection decisions. Lack of clear limits
on using up resources such as current climate generates costs
(climate change) on all participants through unsustainable
exploitation because GHG concentrations and, therefore, cur-
rent climate are stocks like fish and timber. Complex institu-
tional arrangements are required to overcome perverse incen-
tives (Ostrom ef al., 1993). Commons dilemmas reflect persis-
tent conflicts among (not between) many individuals (produc-

"Discourse or narrative — the written and spoken word — is one of the most important ways in which governments, businesses, NGOs, and the
media influence each other and build agreement on policy directions. One of the most important barriers to GHG mitigation is the perception
by some participants in national and international discourses that mitigation efforts might be costly, or might conflict with values such as indi-
vidual freedom and equity. By analyzing these people’s discourse, new opportunities may be identified for developing GHG mitigation mea-
sures that are consistent with their core values. It may also be possible to build new coalitions among institutions and actors, to seek mutual-
ly satisfactory GHG mitigation strategies.

"Discourse and narrative can take many forms, including history, science, philosophy, folklore, and “common sense”. Foucault (1961, 1975)
has shown how narratives become an instrument for wielding power. MacIntyre (1985) offers a way of thinking about narrative as part of our
cultural context or tradition, as something that we inhabit. Professional analysts, such as scientists and economists, are members of groups that
define themselves by such traditions and have their own narratives about the world. Our narratives co-evolve with our notions of “the good”,
our understanding of our selves, our conception of society, our science (conception of nature), and our understanding of God or the spiritual
dimension (Taylor, 1989; Latour, 1993). These understandings and conceptions are also central to our responses to climate change.

its central aims of economic and technological progress and its commitment to finding “the good” in the everyday working life. This tra-

nature and society.

"Analyzing discourses can provide essential insights into different people’s assumptions and beliefs about the world. Thompson and Rayner
(1998), Ney (2000) and Thompson (2000) have mapped out some of the essential features of the discourses that are used to describe and define
positions on climate change. They focus in particular on two axes of the discourses: their view of nature and their conception of society. For
example, some view the environment as robust, while others view it as fragile and vulnerable to human interference. Some believe that society
works best through market-based institutions, while others believe that there should be more explicit emphasis on egalitarian, participatory
approaches. Ney differentiates three main orientations: market-based, egalitarian, and contractarian or hierarchical. Some characteristics of
these orientations are summarized in Table 5.3. Of these three, the market orientation clearly dominates international negotiations as well as the
dialogue on climate change within many countries. It is also the source of the dominant discourse on climate mitigation policy within the IPCC.

tends to blame institutions such as businesses and governments which represent that tradition. However, narratives within the romantic
tradition tend not to recognize the role of romanticism in shaping the consumption patterns for which industry produces.

The humanist tradition, with much older roots going back to ancient Greece, is maintained by academic and intellectual circles in mod-
em society, and is committed to the search for “the good life”. Viewed from this tradition, the climate change problem appears to be
caused by the failure of the modern and romantic traditions to understand human nature, and the nature of the good life. Less emphasis
should be placed on material production and consumption, and more should be placed on developing family relationships, communities,
civic involvement, and opportunities for learning and contemplation.

This is in part cause by the lack of integration and communi-

This refers to the significant restrictions on capital availability
for low-income households and small commercial businesses.
Home mortgages for instance do not as a rule carry a lower
interest rate for efficient homes, which have low annual ener-
gy costs. In case of switching to modern cooking stoves (elec-
tric, kerosene, or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for example)
in rural areas of developing countries, the barriers result from
household income, accessibility to modern fuels, the relative
cost of traditional and modern fuels, and cooking habits
(Soussan, 1987). For example, in view of both national and
global benefits, use of low-cost electric stoves has been noted
as a viable substitute for improved biomass cookstoves, as they
can contribute effectively to preserve forests to enhance carbon
sequestration (CEEEZ, 1998). Despite this realization, there
has been a low level of switching from charcoal stoves to elec-
tric stoves. This is largely because of a lack of finance, result-
ing from low monthly income of which 35 % to 45 % is spent
on fuel (CEEEZ, 1998).

oping countries and countries in transition, has been hampered
by a lack of adherence to economic tariff setting (based on long-
run marginal cost (LRMC)). Attempts to rigorously follow this
concept, however, have resulted in social problems. For exam-
ple, in Russia, a country in the process of transformation to a
market economy, LRMC has led to pensioners not being able to
afford their electricity bills, requiring subsidies amounting to
20%-35% of the budgets of local authorities (Gritsevich, 2000).

"Technological and social changes bring about opportunities to
improve the efficiency of buildings and appliances. A change
in the production line for the manufacture of an appliance
offers an opportunity for introducing new energy saving fea-

government may have the opportunity to intervene and have
energy saving features installed prior to the registration of that
sale. Targeting opportunities at a point where the stock is like-

by the United States Department of Energy (DOE) and
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), exist for both resi-
dential and commercial buildings, and appliances (Harris and
Casey-McCabe, 1996). The Energy Star programme works
with manufacturers to promote existing energy-efficient prod-
ucts, such as residential buildings, personal computers, TVs,
etc., and to develop new ones. Manufacturers can affix an eas-
ily visible label to products that meet Energy Star minimum
standards. These programmes also facilitate the exchange of
information between end-users on their experience with ener-

"The lack of adequate and accurate information, and the limited
ability of users to absorb it adds to the cost of its provision to
consumers. Since energy costs are typically small on an indi-
vidual basis, it is rational for consumers to ignore them in the
face of information gathering and transaction costs. For
instance, Sony was able to reduce the standby power loss in
TVs from 7-8 watts to about 0.6 watt, a saving of US$5 per
year per TV. One reason for consumers to not buy more effi-
cient appliances, despite a label advertising this fact, is that
consumers are wary or mistrustful because of past experience
with advertised misinformation (Stern and Aronson, 1984).
Kempton and Montgomery (1982) have shown that residential
consumers systematically underestimate energy savings,
because they lack the ability to use the information to calculate
and compare savings with investment. Furthermore, Kempton
and Layne (1994) liken today’s energy bills to receiving a sin-
gle monthly bill for all groceries purchased with no identifica-
tion of the cost of individual items.

activity is closely interwoven with infrastructure, lifestyles, eco-

because of these complex links, experts do not always agree on
the best mitigation strategy. Climate change and energy saving
is usually a minor factor in decisions and policy in the sector,
and mitigation strategies may not be implemented if they seem
to reduce the benefits provided by the transport system to indi-
viduals and firms. Appropriate mixes of policies need to be
designed for local situations. And policies can be very slow to
take effect because of the inertia of the infrastructure, technolo-

"Chapter 3 notes the existence of a range of technologies whose
use in cars could substantially reduce emissions, including
lightweight materials, gasoline direct injection engines, electric
hybrid drive-trains, and fuel cell-electric drive-trains.
Considerable and unexpected progress has been made in com-
mercializing some of these technologies since the SAR.
Chapter 3 also reviews studies that estimate the socioeconom-
ic potential for energy efficiency improvements. The rapid
emission growth from the sector, despite the considerable
apparent mitigation potential, is mainly a result of a continuing
increase in demand for mobility of people and goods. The ener-
gy intensity of personal travel is near-constant or increasing in
many countries, with increasing use of sports utility vehicles
and people carriers, and rising vehicle weight and power in
most categories of vehicle (ECMT, 1997; Davis, 1999).

"Stated preference surveys in the United States have shown that
consumers would prefer to purchase energy efficient cars, and
would be prepared to pay US$400-600 for each litre/100km
reduction in fuel consumption (Bunch ef al., 1993; US DOE,
1995). This is about the amount that would be expected from
the fuel savings over the life of the car (Michaelis, 1996b).
However, there is no evidence that this valuation of fuel econ-
omy is reflected in the car market. There may be several rea-
sons. First, many vehicle purchasers have to work within bud-
gets set by the size of loan they can obtain to buy a car, and
such budgets are likely to be set independent of the amount
they will have to spend on fuel. Where they have a number of
high priorities in their vehicle choice such as comfort, size,
safety, and performance, they will spend their budgets on those
priorities rather than on energy efficient technologies that
increase vehicle price. Second, vehicle manufacturers have no
incentive to promote energy efficiency, and a strong interest in

"The phenomenon of lock-in can also be seen to apply to road
transport more generally. Cars are preferred over other trans-

"A second aspect of the lock-in to car transport is the result of
economies of scale, and a century of R&D and learning from
experience in car production. The real cost of owning and oper-

transport costs have risen. The declining number of people
using buses, especially in rural areas, makes it uneconomic to
operate services without subsidies. Falling bus and train occu-

the secondhand car market, where more fuel efficient cars
tend to be more expensive (Daly and Mayer, 1983; Kahn,
1986), reflecting perhaps half to three quarters of the value of
fuel savings they will offer (Michaelis, 1996a). The lack of
control of vehicle users over technology is exacerbated by the
concentration of the global car industry in Annex I countries,
and in a small number of transnational companies (IPCC,

non-motorized transport has been generally less readily avail-
able than for road building since the 1950s. Other government
instruments often support road transport, one example being
planning laws that require off-street parking to be provided in
new urban developments. It is the combination of policies and
institutional relationships protecting road transport interests
that poses the greatest barrier to change, rather than any single
type of instrument (OECD, 1997b).

reverse the decline in the environment and in communities in
city centres by moving away from zoning and car-based trans-

Often, the best opportunities for such concerted action arise at
a local level, where the negative impacts of transport are most
keenly felt (Michaelis, 1997a). There are several positive
experiences of change, such as a Scottish example where a
public consultation process led to a large shift in local govern-

have explored the effects of internalizing those costs through
fuel taxes and other measures (EC, 1996; Michaelis, 1996b;
ECMT, 1997). However, transport fuel taxes have proved very
unpopular in some countries, especially where they are seen as
revenue-raising measures (MVA, 1995), and may be an ineffi-
cient means of internalizing environmental costs other than
those associated with carbon dioxide (CO,) emissions. Charges
on road users, including parking fees in many towns and tolls,
especially on motorways, have been accepted where they are
earmarked to cover the costs of road provision (Michaelis,
1997a). Several studies have explored the potential for adjust-

"Under perfect market conditions, all additional needs for ener-
gy services are provided by the lowest cost measures for
increased energy supply or reduced energy demand. There is
considerable evidence that energy efficiency investments that
are lower in cost than the cost of marginal energy supply are
not being made in real markets, suggesting that market barriers
exist. A study of the industrial electric motor market in France
has demonstrated the existence of barriers arising from deci-
sion-making practices, within an environment characterized by
lack of information and split incentives (de Almeida, 1998).
Barriers may exist at various points in the diffusion process of
measures to reduce energy use and/or GHG emissions. The dif-
fusion process depends on many factors such as capital cost,
operating cost savings, information availability, network con-
nections, imitation effects, and other factors (DeCanio and
Laitner, 1997). All of these factors influence the probability of
a firm adopting a given technology at a particular point in time.
Barriers may take many forms in this process, and should be
reviewed in the context of the industrial and business environ-
ment (e.g., multi-criteria optimization, firm size and structure,
market structure, opportunity, and information routes). While
barriers exist, it is important to note that ESTs and practices
may also represent a strategic and competitive advantage

"In addition to the problems identified above, other important
barriers include (1) the “invisibility” of energy efficiency mea-
sures and the difficulty of demonstrating and quantifying their
impacts; (2) lack of inclusion of external costs of energy pro-
duction and use in the price of energy, and (3) slow diffusion
of innovative technology into markets (Fisher and Rothkopf,
1989; Levine ef al., 1994; Sanstad and Howarth, 1994).
Regulation can contribute to more successful innovation (see
above), but sometimes, indirectly, be a barrier to implementa-
tion of low GHG emitting practices. A specific example is
industrial co-generation (CHP), which may be hindered by the
lack of clear policies for buy-back of excess power, regulation
for standby power, and wheeling of power to other users (Box
5.5 ). Co-generation in the Indian sugar industry was hindered
by the lack of these regulations (WWF, 1996), while the exis-
tence of clear policies can be a driver for diffusion and expan-
sion of industrial co-generation, as is evidenced by the devel-
opment of industrial co-generation in the Netherlands (Blok,
1993). Finally, firms typically under-invest in R&D, despite
the high paybacks (Nelson, 1982; Cohen and Noll, 1994), but
recent analyses seem to suggest that public and private R&D
funding for sustainable energy technologies is decreasing in
developed countries (Kammen and Margolis, 1999).

"Cost-effective energy efficiency measures are often not under-
taken as a result of lack of information on the part of the con-
sumer, or a lack of confidence in the information, or high trans-
action costs for obtaining reliable information (Reddy, 1991;
Sioshansi, 1991; OTA, 1993; Levine er al., 1995). Information
collection and processing consumes time and resources, which
is especially difficult for small firms (Gruber and Brand, 1991;
Velthuijsen, 1995). In many developing countries public capac-
ity for information dissemination is especially lacking (TERI,
1997). The information gap concerns not only consumers of
end-use equipment but all aspects of the market (Reddy, 1991).
Many producers of end-use equipment have little knowledge of
ways to make their products energy efficient, nor access to the
technology for producing the improved products. Equipment
suppliers may also lack the information, or ways to assess,
evaluate, or disseminate the information. End-use providers are
often unacquainted with efficient technology. In addition, there
is a focus on market and production expansion, which may be
more effective than efficiency improvements, to generate prof-
it maximization. In the New Independent States (NIS) firms are
more directed towards increasing competitiveness, although
there are examples where firms have used energy efficiency as
a means to reduce production costs (Gritsevich, 2000). Also, a
lack of adequate management tools, techniques, and proce-
dures to account for the economic benefits of efficiency
improvements is an information barrier (see below). Finally,
other policies and regulations may limit access to energy-effi-
cient technologies. For example, import regulations for specif-
ic projects and industries in China (Fisher-Vanden, 1998) and
India (Schumacher and Sathaye, 1999) limited or imposed high

that are socially desirable. An example of a financial incentive
programme that has had a large impact on energy efficiency is
the energy conservation loan programme that China instituted
in 1980. This loan programme is the largest energy efficiency
investment programme ever undertaken by any developing
country, and currently commits 7% to 8% of total energy
investment to efficiency, primarily in heavy industry. The pro-
gramme contributed to the remarkable decline in the energy
intensity of China’s economy. Since 1980 energy consumption
has grown at an average rate of 4.8% per year (compared to
7.5% in the 1970s) while GDP has grown twice as fast (9.5%

Lévéque, 1998; OECD, 2000). There is a wide variety in VAs,
ranging from public and consumer recognition for participation
in a programme (e.g., Energy Star Program in the USA) to
legally binding negotiated agreements (e.g., the Long-Term
Agreements in the Netherlands). Voluntary agreements can
have some apparent advantages above regulation, in that they
may be easier and faster to implement, and may lead to more
cost-effective solutions. Initial experiences with environmental
VAs with respect to effectiveness and efficiency varied strong-
ly, although only a few ex-post evaluations are available as
most voluntary approaches are recent (EEA, 1997; Worrell et
al., 1997, Borkey and Lévéque, 1998). The Dutch long-term
agreements on energy efficiency in industry have been evalu-
ated favourably, and are expected to achieve the targets for
most sectors (Universiteit Utrecht, 1997). The evaluation high-
lighted the need for more open and consistent mechanisms for
reporting, target setting, and supportive policies. Preliminary
evaluations show that VAs are most suitable for pro-active
industries, a small number of participants, mature sectors with
limited competition, and long-term targets (EEA, 1997). The
evaluations also show that VAs are most effective if they
include clear targets, a specified baseline, a clear monitoring
and reporting mechanism, and if there are technical solutions
available with relatively limited compliance costs (EEA,
1997). In some cases the result of a VA may come close to
those of a regulation, i.e., in the case of negotiated agreements
as used in some European countries. Outside developed coun-
tries, also some NICs, e.g., Republic of Korea, consider the use
of VAs (Kim, 1998), while the Global Semiconductor
Partnership is an example of an international voluntary agree-
ment to reduce PFC emissions.

The significant technological advances of recent years (Major, 1995; Rohrer, 1996) are not spread widely enough. This barrier is the
most stringent in developing countries and in small institutions and companies, especially when the latter have no technical back-
ground. When donors, international institutions, lending banks, etc. are not familiar with the co-generation technology, it will not be
implemented by developing and transitional economies (Dadhich, 1996; Nielsen and Bernsen, 1996). Additionally, the economics of
co-generation is relatively complex (Verbruggen et al., 1992; Hoff et al., 1996; Verbruggen, 1996). Optimization of co-generation pro-
jects requires extensive information about many determinants of profitability. This span of know-how makes its availability to small-
scale independent projects exceptional. Finally, uncertainty about the main determinants like fuel prices, fuel availability, regulatory
conditions, environmental legislation, contract terms with the power grid, etc. constitutes a significant barrier.

In several countries, the position and attitude of the grid operator have been hostile towards distributed generation initiatives (Riidig,
1986; Dufait, 1996). Incumbent power companies sometimes impose heavy regulations on producers or industries that file for a con-
nection to the electricity grid, imposing technical prescriptions that cannot be set in standard packages. Tariff conditions are a partic-
ularly difficult issue, because the value of the kWh is dependent on time, place, quality, and reliability of supply, and differs for the
three types of power flows that can be exchanged: surplus power that the co-generator delivers to the grid, shortage or make-up power
bought by the co-generator at the grid, and back-up power (Verbruggen, 1990). Although there are widely accepted principles to fix
the tariff for the different transactions, theoretical and practical difficulties in defining and measuring the costs constrain the develop-
ment of contracts (Dismukes and Kleit, 1999). In many countries high tariffs on wheeling of electricity act as an additional barrier. In
several countries the opportunities for small-scale distributed power generation are improving because grid connection is provided at
neutral or even subsidized terms (the Netherlands and Japan; Blok and Farla, 1996).

utilities, using lower discount rates, assuming higher risks, and making investments assisted by the multilateral financing system,
developed an important hydropower system that represented near 50% of the supply. The new context offers lower opportunities for
this “old” technology, and acts as a barrier to a more “costly” option from a private point of view.

To some extent the reduced public funding on new technolo-

Private sector funding offers one approach to increasing invest-

research has more than quadrupled in the USA in real terms
between 1970 and 1990. Its international role is, however, con-
troversial. Protection of intellectual property rights is weak,
especially for commercially developed seed varieties
(Deardorff, 1993; Frisvold and Condon, 1995, 1998; Knudson,

more investment from the private sector at the risk of increas-
ing the farmers’ dependency on the annual purchase of new
seeds. There are also concerns that genetic resources that have
not been considered as privately-owned intellectual property
may get patented worldwide by private investors.

transfer results of the research to the local level. Research on
forests has not only suffered from a lack of resources; it has not
been sufficiently interdisciplinary to provide an integrated view

Forestry-sector GHG mitigation activities and joint implemen-

that challenge their credibility. The twin objectives of using
forestry to mitigate climate change and managing forests sus-

efits from carbon offset projects in the sector (Andrasko,
1997). While methods generally exist to monitor carbon stocks
in vegetation, soils and products, operational systems that
could be readily implemented for this purpose are lacking in all
countries (IPCC, 2000a). Monitoring and verification are key
elements in gaining the credibility needed to capture the poten-
tial benefits of forestry sector response options, particularly in
reducing deforestation (Fearnside, 1997). While this is a gener-
ic barrier to deforestation reduction initiatives, it also repre-
sents an opportunity for transferring the technologies needed to
monitor land-use change and carbon stocks and flows. Among

this task and is trying to understand forestry sector emissions

"Forestry mitigation projects are likely to be largely funded by
Annex I countries and implemented in non-Annex | countries
and EITs. Technology, including management systems, is an
integral part of all projects funded by bilateral or multilateral or
commercial agencies. Thus, promotion of mitigation projects
also automatically promotes the flow of technology from donor
agencies or countries to host countries or agencies. In fact,
technology transfer is already happening. Forestry sector
options are of relatively low cost compared to those in the
energy sector (Sathaye and Ravindranath, 1998). But there are
some problems and uncertainties regarding the incremental C
abated: its sustainability, measurement, verification, and certi-
fication. All forestry sector GHG mitigation projects must
ensure that they meet accepted standards for sustainable forest
management (Sathaye et al., 1997b). Independent verification
of C abatement would help to increase the credibility and fund-
ing of forestry-sector mitigation projects.

increased globalization tends to expose even remote popula-

the process of siting industrial plants (Datta, 1999). The possi-

of reclamation centres where the public can deliver wastes;
arrangements for separation and reclamation at disposal sites

waste disposal with by-product recovery; and landfilling of

how wastes could be best ultilized to meet their raw material
requirement. Industry can be encouraged to accept wastes as

"There are many barriers and opportunities, from the ones
described before, which have a particular relevance to devel-
oping countries and EITs. The issues of sustainable and equi-
table development resonate in these countries as they undergo
a rapid transformation towards market-oriented systems that
are immersed in a global economy. Institutionally, the transfor-
mation in developing countries is significant, but it is often
confined to specific sectors, such as the deregulation of the
energy sector. On the other hand, the socialist economies are
undergoing a more radical shift of the whole economy. These
global patterns of change provide an opportunity for introduc-
ing GHG mitigation technologies and practices that are consis-
tent with DES goals. At the macro-level the change to a market
economy and the liberalization and opening of markets to for-
eign investment provides an opportunity to make significant
improvements in the GHG intensity of the economy. Similarly,
the restructuring of the energy sectors also offers an opportuni-
ty to introduce demand management and low or no GHG-emit-
ting energy sources. As the sections below note, however, a
culture of energy subsidies, institutional intertia, fragmented
capital markets, vested interests, etc. presents major barriers to
the introduction of such technologies and practices. The devel-
oped countries face different types of barriers and opportuni-
ties that prevent or slow the penetration of GHG mitigation
technologies. These barriers and opportunities are related to
their more affluent lifestyles. The sections below emphasize
situations in the three groups of countries that call for a more
careful consideration of the barriers and opportunities they
face.

however, the transition has brought greater climate pressures.
For example, in those countries returning to economic growth,
the use of motor vehicles for both passenger and freight trans-

"Lack of available capital and lack of finance at low interest

purchase of inexpensive and often GHG-intensive equipment

ways to increase the provision of energy services.

"At the end of first decade of the transition to a market econo-

outstripped bygone relative homogeneity. Central Europe and
the Baltic countries have made a successful leap in economic
reforms and restructuring, while countries of the former Soviet
Union (so called New Independent States - NIS) continue to
struggle with economic recession and political instability
(EBRD, 1999). Recent empirical studies on the interrelation-
ship between environmental improvement and economic
development in transition economies undertaken by the World
Bank, EBRD, and OECD have demonstrated that countries that
were more successful in economic development and structural
reforms have generally also been more successful in curbing
emissions through targeted environmental policies. Aggregated
GDP among advanced reforming countries has been gradually
increasing, while emissions of main air pollutants have contin-
ued to decrease. Energy consumption has been stabilized and a
switch away from coal has been recorded mainly in Poland and
the Czech Republic causing GHG-intensity of GDP to
decrease. In contrast, in the slower reforming countries in NIS,
falling output, rather than economic restructuring or environ-
mental protection efforts, appears to have been the main factor
behind the decrease of energy use and emissions of pollutants,
including GHGs (OECD, 1999a).

decisions (see Section 5.4.3). The movement of households to
suburban areas increases the distance traveled to work, and for
leisure, and adds to a vehicle’s fuel consumption. The lock-in

barrier to new efficient forms of mass transport, while the well-
established gasoline-based infrastructure is a barrier to the
introduction of new less GHG-intensive fuels and associated

"In the household sector, for instance, although a CFL offers a
relatively short payback period, the large price differential
between the CFL and an incandescent bulb poses a significant
first-cost barrier to consumers. Most programmes to promote
CFLs have focused on a subsidy to lower its first cost (Mills,
1993; Meyers, 1998). Raising the efficiency of other consumer
appliances encounters barriers such as the relatively low ener-
gy cost, bundling of higher efficiency with other higher value
attributes, and lack of information about energy consumption.
Standards and labels are being implemented in several coun-
tries in order to overcome these barriers. While many commu-
nities and national governments have regulations for more effi-
cient construction, rising affluence has increased the demand
for homes with a larger floor area, which negates efficiency
gains. Disincentives may also exist in the market structure,
e.g., a building owner may not be interested in energy efficient
designs if the user is responsible for paying for the energy
used.

efficiency, especially given stable macroeconomic conditions
and relatively high energy prices. In these countries the main
bottleneck to environmental finance is not the lack of finance,
but rather the lack of a “pull factor”. Lack of implementation
of the Polluter Pays Principle, and weak enforcement of the
environmental and climate policy framework does not stimu-
late sufficient demand for investments that would bring main-
ly GHG reduction benefits, with little private financial return
(OECD, 1999b). In NIS, however, the weak policy framework
is aggravated by the overwhelming lack of liquidity both in the
public and private sector. Limited financial resources, which
are available to authorities have not always been used in a cost-
effective way. Opportunities to leverage additional financing
from public and private, domestic and foreign sources were

The countries in the region have undergone a rapid deregula-

Central European countries has generally led to increased
resource efficiency and replacement of obsolete and GHG

the former Soviet Union, particularly in Russia and Ukraine,
the rapid pace of liberalization and privatization has not been
matched by the development of institutions as well as a regu-

functioning market economy. Perverse incentives that had gen-
erated many of the environmental problems of centrally
planned economies, such as rent seeking and lack of incentives
for efficiency and restructuring, now undermine restructuring
of already private enterprises (EBRD, 1999). But successful
economic policies have not been a panacea for successful
GHG-mitigation improvements. Targeted environmental poli-

that prevent or slow the diffusion of mitigation tech-
nologies. The models would also need to take alterna-
tive development pathways into consideration. An
improved understanding of technology transfer both
within and across countries would be required since the
actors and barriers tend to be very different.

What is the appropriate role for stakeholders in the
above decision-making processes? The roles of govern-

particularly important in sectors where the social, cul-
tural, institutional, and market context is changing
rapidly. An identification of their emerging roles would
help decision makers manage technology transfer bet-

Does market globalization favour or hamper the diffu-

regulation confer to firms and nations a long-term tech-

opportunity to plant seeds of mitigation technologies
that are less GHG intensive, but it could also bring
about proliferation of polluting technologies. It is
important to understand the ongoing processes and to
determine ways to assist the transfer of less GHG-
intensive technologies.

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
"	Title
"' In keeping within the defined scope of Working Group III, policies
and measures that can be used to reduce the costs of adaptation to cli-
mate change are not examined.
"	Text
"The purpose of this chapter is to examine the major types of
policies and measures that can be used to mitigate net concen-
trations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere.!
Alternative policy instruments are described and assessed in
terms of specific criteria, on the basis of the most recent litera-
ture. Naturally, emphasis is on the instruments mentioned in
the Kyoto Protocol (the Kyoto mechanisms), because they
focus on achieving GHG emissions limits, and the extent of
their envisaged international application is unprecedented. In
addition to economic dimensions, political, economic, legal,
and institutional elements are considered insofar as they are
relevant to the discussion of policies and measures.
"	Text
"Possible criteria for the assessment of policy instruments
include environmental effectiveness, cost effectiveness, distri-
bution considerations, administrative and political feasibility,
government revenues, wider economic effects, wider environ-
mental effects, and effects on changes in attitudes, awareness,
learning, innovation, technical progress, and dissemination of
technology. Each government may apply different weights to
various criteria when evaluating policy options for GHG miti-
gation, depending on national and sector-level circumstances.
Moreover, a government may apply different sets of weights to
the criteria when evaluating national (domestic) versus inter-
national policy instruments.
"	Text
"To develop reasonable assessments of the feasibility of
implementing GHG mitigation policies in countries in the
process of structural reform, it is important to understand this
new policy context. Recent measures taken to liberalize ener-
gy markets were inspired mainly by desires to increase com-
petition in energy and power markets, but they can have sig-
nificant emissions implications also, through their impact on
the production and technology pattern of energy and/or
power supply. In the long run, the consumption pattern
change might be more important than the sole implementa-
tion of climate change mitigation measures (e.g. see Chapter
2, the B1 scenario).
"	Text
"Market-based instruments—principally domestic taxes and
domestic tradable permit systems—are attractive to govern-
ments in many cases because they are efficient; they are fre-
quently introduced in concert with conventional regulatory
measures. When implementing a domestic emissions tax, poli-
cymakers must consider the collection point, the tax base, the
variation or uniformity among sectors, the association with
trade, employment, revenue, and the exact form of the mecha-
nism. Each of these can influence the appropriate design of a
domestic emissions tax, and political or other concerns are
likely to play a role also. For example, a tax levied on the ener-
gy content of fuels could be much more costly than a carbon
tax for the equivalent emissions reduction, because an energy
tax raises the price of all forms of energy, regardless of their
contribution to carbon dioxide emissions. Yet, many nations
may choose to use energy taxes for reasons other than cost-
"	Text
"Any individual country can choose from a large set of possible
policies, measures, and instruments to limit domestic GHG
emissions. These can be categorized into market-based instru-
ments (which include taxes on emissions, carbon, and/or energy,
tradable permits, subsidies, and deposit—refund systems), regu-
latory instruments (which include non-tradable permits, tech-
nology and performance standards, product bans, and direct
government spending, including research and development
investment) and voluntary agreements (VAs) of which some fall
in the category of market-based instruments. Likewise, a group
of countries that wants to limit its collective GHG emissions
could agree to implement one, or a mix, of instruments. These
are (in arbitrary order) tradable quotas, Joint Implementation
(JD, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), harmonized
taxes on emissions, carbon, and/or energy, an international tax
on emissions, carbon, and/or energy, non-tradable quotas, inter-
national technology and product standards, VAs, and direct
international transfers of financial resources and technology.
"	Text
"The economics literature on the choice of policies adopted
emphasizes the importance of interest-group pressures, focus-
ing on the demand for regulation. However, it has tended to
neglect the “supply side” of the political equation, which is
emphasized in the political science literature of the legislators
and government and party officials who design and implement
regulatory policy, and who ultimately decide which instru-
ments or mix of instruments will be used. The point of compli-
ance of alternative policy instruments, whether they are
applied to fossil fuel users or manufacturers, for example, is
likely to be politically crucial to the choice of policy instru-
ment. And a key insight is that some forms of regulation actu-
ally benefit the regulated industry, for example, by limiting
entry into the industry or by imposing higher costs on new
entrants. A policy that imposes costs on industry as a whole
might still be supported by firms who, as a consequence, would
fare better than their competitors. Regulated firms, of course,
are not the only group with a stake in regulation: opposing
interest groups will fight for their own interests.

"A country committed to a limit on its GHG emissions can also
meet this limit by implementing a tradable permit system that
directly or indirectly limits emissions of domestic sources.
Like taxes, permit systems pose a number of design issues,
including type of permit, sources included, point of compli-
ance, and use of banking. To cover all sources with a single
domestic permit regime is unlikely. The certainty provided by
a tradable permit system that a given emission level for partic-

prices (and hence compliance costs). To address this concern,
a hybrid policy that caps compliance costs could be adopted,

Energy- efficiency standards have reduced energy use in
a growing number of countries. Standards may also
help develop the administrative infrastructure needed to
implement market-based policies. The main disadvan-
tage of standards is that they can be inefficient, but effi-
ciency can be improved if the standard focuses on the
desired results and leaves as much flexibility as possi-
ble in the choice of how to achieve the results.

VAs may take a variety of forms. Proponents of VAs
point to low transaction costs and consensus elements,
while sceptics emphasize the risk of free riding, and the
risk that the private sector will not pursue real emis-
sions reduction in the absence of monitoring and
enforcement.

Imperfect information is widely recognized as a key
market failure that can have significant effects on
improved energy efficiency, and hence emissions.
Information instruments include environmental
labelling, energy audits, and industrial reporting
requirements, and information campaigns are market-
ing elements in many energy efficiency programmes.

There is obviously a relatively heavy focus on the Kyoto instru-

since the IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR; IPCC, 1996,
Section 11.5), and the extent of their envisaged international
application is unprecedented. Wherever feasible, political eco-
nomic, legal, and institutional elements are discussed insofar as
they are relevant to the implementation of policies and measures.
To make both theoretical and practical points the chapter offers
occasional examples of policy instrument application, but the
effort in this regard is limited by the existing literature, which is
weighted towards the experience of industrialized countries.+

"¢ An emissions tax is a levy imposed by a government on each
unit of emissions by a source subject to the tax. Since virtual-
ly all of the carbon in fossil fuels ultimately is emitted as CO,,
a levy on the carbon content of fossil fuels—a carbon tax—is
equivalent to an emissions tax for emissions caused by fossil
fuel combustion. An energy tax—a levy on the energy content
of fuels-reduces the demand for energy and so reduces CO,
emissions through fossil fuel use.

¢ A tradable permit (cap-and-trade) system establishes a limit
on aggregate emissions by specified sources, requires each
source to hold permits equal to its actual emissions, and
allows permits to be traded among sources. This is different
from a credit system, in which credits are created when a
source reduces its emissions below a baseline equal to an esti-
mate of what they would have been in the absence of the
emissions reduction action. A source subject to an emissions-
limitation commitment can use credits to meet its obligation.

¢ Asubsidy is a direct payment from the government to an enti-
ty, or a tax reduction to that entity, for implementing a prac-
tice the government wishes to encourage. GHG emissions can
be reduced by lowering existing subsidies that in effect raise
emissions, such as subsidies to fossil fuel use, or by providing
subsidies for practices that reduce emissions or enhance sinks
(e.g., for insulation of buildings or planting trees).

¢ A deposit-refund system combines a deposit or fee (tax) on a
commodity with a refund or rebate (subsidy) for implementa-
tion of a specified action.

¢ A VA is an agreement between a government authority and
one or more private parties, as well as a unilateral commit-
ment that is recognized by the public authority, to achieve
environmental objectives or to improve environmental per-
formance beyond compliance.

¢ Anon-tradable permit system establishes a limit on the GHG
emissions of each regulated source. Each source must keep
its actual emissions below its own limit; trading among
sources is not permitted.

¢ A technology or performance standard establishes minimum
requirements for products or processes to reduce GHG emis-
sions associated with the manufacture or use of the products
or processes.

¢ A product ban prohibits the use of a specified product in a
particular application, such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in
refrigeration systems, that gives rise to GHG emissions.

¢ Direct government spending and investment involves gov-
ernment expenditures on research and development (R&D)
measures to lower GHG emissions or enhance GHG sinks.

Emissions trading under Article 17 of the Kyoto Protocol is a tradable quota system based on the assigned amounts (AAs) calcu-
lated from the emissions reduction and limitation commitments listed in Annex B of the Protocol.

JI allows the government of, or entities from, a country with a GHG emissions limit to contribute to the implementation of a pro-
ject to reduce emissions, or enhance sinks, in another country with a national commitment and to receive emission reduction units
(ERUs) equal to part, or all, of the emissions reduction achieved. The ERUs can be used by the investor country or another Annex
I party to help meet its national emissions limitation commitment. Article 6 of the Kyoto Protocol establishes JI among Parties with
emissions reduction and limitation commitments listed in Annex B of the Protocol.

The CDM allows the government of, or entities from, a country with a GHG emissions limit to contribute to the implementation
of a project to reduce emissions, or possibly enhance sinks, in a country with no national commitment and to receive CERs equal
to part, or all, of the emissions reductions achieved. Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol establishes the CDM to contribute to sus-
tainable development of the host country and to help Annex I Parties meet their emissions reduction and limitation commitments.
A harmonized tax on emissions, carbon, and/or energy commits participating countries to impose a tax at a common rate on the
same sources.’ Each country can retain the tax revenue it collects.

An international tax on emissions, carbon, and/or energy is a tax imposed on specified sources in participating countries by an inter-
national agency. The revenue is distributed or used as specified by participant countries or the international agency.

Non-tradable quotas impose a limit on the national GHG emissions of each participating country to be attained exclusively through
domestic actions.

International product and/or technology standards establish minimum requirements for the affected products and/or technologies
in countries in which they are adopted. The standards reduce GHG emissions associated with the manufacture or use of the prod-
ucts and/or application of the technology.

An international VA is an agreement between two or more governments and one or more entities to limit GHG emissions or to
implement measures that will have this effect.

Direct international transfers of financial resources and technology involve transfers of financial resources from a national gov-
ernment to the government or legal entity in another country, directly or via an international agency, with the objective of stimu-
lating GHG emissions reduction or sink enhancement actions in the recipient country.

that can achieve emissions reductions more cheaply may be
more supportive of market-based schemes, such as tradable

"Regulated firms are not the only group with a stake in regula-

Environmental groups, for example, tend to favour stringent
targets, although many have opposed market-based instruments
out of a philosophical concern that such policies give firms
“licenses to pollute” or because of objections to attempts to
quantify or monetize the environmental damages from pollu-
tion (Kelman, 1981; Hahn, 1989; Sandel, 1997). Some groups
draw an ethical distinction between taxes and tradable permit
systems, in which taxes are morally deficient because they put
a price on emissions but set no upper limit on allowable pollu-
tion, while permits ensure a set level of emissions (Goodin,
1994). Other environmental groups support market-based poli-

"One key insight of this literature is that some forms of regula-
tion can actually benefit the regulated industry, for example, by
limiting entry into the industry or imposing higher costs on
new entrants (Rasmusen and Zupan, 1991; Stigler, 1971). In
the environmental arena, conventional regulation may provide
firms with rents that result from reductions in output and raised
prices as a consequence of regulation (Buchanan and Tullock,
1975; Maloney and McCormick, 1982). Stricter standards for
new pollution sources benefit existing firms by raising barriers
to entry (Nelson et al., 1993). Polluters’ self-interest may also
help explain the prevalence of tradable permits that have been
allocated free (“grandfathered”) when market-based instru-
ments have been used. Permits allocated free to existing firms
represent a transfer of rents from government to industry while
auctioned permits and emissions taxes generally impose a
heavier burden on polluters. Finally, VAs may be the preferred
policy approach from industry’s perspective, because these
leave more of the initiative with the private sector (at least so
it is perceived), which may enhance industry’s chances of cap-
turing rents.

electric utilities), manufacturers of energy-using products (e.g.,
automobile manufacturers), and manufacturers of energy-effi-

efficient lighting). Environmental organizations in the USA
and Europe seem to be divided—some groups have embraced
market-based policies such as emissions permits and carbon

"Industry groups—in particular, large producers and users of
fuel—are also likely to focus their efforts on the allocation of
carbon-reduction responsibilities, whatever the instrument. If a
system of emissions standards is put into place, for example,
existing firms will benefit if tighter standards are imposed on
new sources, as has happened in a number of countries. Under
an emissions tax, firms are likely to seek tax credits, differen-
tial tax rates, or exemptions to relieve their tax burden. In a sys-
tem of tradable permits, firms are likely to support the free
allocation of permits to participants, rather than to sell them at
auction or distribute them to the public (for subsequent sale to
firms). For project-based mechanisms-CDM and Jl-they
would favour leaving much of the initiative with the private
sector (Jepma and Van der Gaast, 1999). Industries that stand
to profit from GHG abatement, including renewable energy
sources, are likely supporters of climate policies (Michaelowa

"These political factors, however, vary widely among coun-
tries. Whether or not a legislature exists, and if so whether in
a parliamentary or presidential system, affects the support for
particular policy instruments. Whether legislators are elected
by district or by party list may affect the political support for
different policy instruments as well. Factors such as the extent
of interest-group organization and how groups interact with
government are also critical—interest groups lobby legislators
in some countries, sit on quasi-governmental decision-making
bodies in others, are relegated to raising public awareness
elsewhere, and in some countries are non-existent. Less tangi-
ble cultural and historical factors can also be critical in influ-
encing the choice of instrument. For example, a country’s
experience with free markets generally may influence whether
or not it chooses to use market-based policy instruments for
environmental protection (Keohane, 1998). Finally, there are
clear political economy limitations of individually applied
price, non-price, and regulatory policies that often lead to the
linked or combined policy strategy that is observed in prac-
tice.

"Before policies and measures that aim to reduce, or remove
barriers that hamper, GHG emissions or enhance sequestration
by sinks are analyzed, it is necessary to understand the sub-
stantial impact that other policies (such as the structural
reforms of trade liberalization and liberalization of energy mar-
kets) have had on GHG emissions in several developing coun-
tries, economies in transition (EITs), and some developed
countries. These policies, sometimes coupled with macroeco-
nomic, market-oriented reforms, set the framework in which
more specific climate policies would be implemented.
Therefore, to assess correctly the feasibility of any particular
policy, it is important to understand this new policy context.
The effect of these reforms on energy use and GHG emissions
is not clear a priori. Impacts can differ widely among coun-
tries, depending on implementation strategies and the existence
of other regulatory policies designed to prevent the undesired
effects of free market operation in the presence of externalities,

"In contrast, some environmental organizations have not
opposed the allocation of rents to industry, recognizing that
free allocation of permits may be the most likely path to imple-

groups to secure other goals in return, such as continuous emis-
sions monitoring—-the US Acid Rain Program is a good exam-
ple (Kete, 1992; Svendsen, 1999). In summary, allocation
schemes favourable to industry appear likely in practice,
because the question of distribution is central to industry,
including industries that will profit from climate policy, but it
is only of secondary importance to environmental groups that
do not support free allocation and to other groups that seek to
reduce GHG emissions. In the US Acid Rain Program, for
example, sulphur dioxide (SO,) emissions allowances worth
about US$5 billion per year were allocated free to electric util-
ities, in part because of interest group politics (Joskow and

"The two largest countries in terms of population and coal
reserves, China and India, have also started to reform their eco-
nomic systems towards a more free-market orientation,
although at a slower pace than many other countries. Since
1978, energy use in China has increased, on average, 4%/yr.
However, the energy—output ratio in China fell 55% between
1978 and 1995.'3 Garbaccio er al. (1999), using input-output
tables, found that most of this reduction arose from technical
change, a result supported by other studies (Polenske and Lin,
1993; Sinton and Levine, 1994). An increase in energy-inten-
sive imports has also led to decreased energy use per unit of
GDP. Others have attributed the reduction to sectoral shifts in
the composition of output (Smil, 1990; Kambara, 1992). As
reform-induced changes aimed at increasing GDP may
increase the use of energy, the net effect on GHG emissions of
structural reform in China is an empirical problem that depends
on the choice of development strategies, technologies, and
complementary policies.

subsidies on coal production, including transfers from both

Transport is indirectly subsidized through infrastructure

dies were higher than those to transportation for the OECD
area. They also found for the USA that larger CO, savings

are in line with the results from other work on internalizing the
external cost of transportation (ECMT, 1998). The same stud-

more likely to value other ancillary benefits through policy

environmental cost internalization, and system-benefit charges
(SBCs; see Boxes 6.6 and 6.7). Several studies have examined
the effects on GHG emissions of the restructuring of the elec-
tricity industry, but the issue is far from resolved. Indications
are that the impacts can be either positive or negative (IEA,
1998b). The degrees of the environmental effects of liberaliza-
tion of the electric utility industry are case specific and depend
on pre-existing circumstances (e.g., fuel mix, vintage of plant,
taxation schemes, and other factors). They also depend on such
factors as national endowment of resources, the fuel mix, the
vintage structure of generation capacity, scope for restructur-
ing, and the size and speed of policy reform (OECD, 1999). In
short, energy-sector structural reform cannot, in itself, guaran-
tee a shift towards less carbon-intensive power generation.!?
On the whole, however, it may provide for a more economi-

to adjust the tax level to meet an internationally agreed emis-
sions commitment (depending on the structure of the interna-
tional agreement; see Section 6.3). The main economic advan-
tage of an emissions tax is that it limits the cost of the reduc-
tion programme by allowing emissions to rise if costs are unex-
pectedly high (IPCC, 1996, Section 11.2.3.1; see also Section
6.3.4.2).

"Since every emitter faces a uniform tax on emissions per tonne
of CO3,, (if energy, equipment, and product markets are per-
fectly competitive) this would result in the least expensive
reductions throughout the economy being undertaken first
(IPCC, 1996, Section 11.5.1; Baumol and Oates, 1988). In the
real world, markets, especially energy markets, deviate from
this ideal, so an emissions tax may not maximize economic
efficiency. Rather, the efficiency of an emissions tax should be
compared with that of alternative policy measures. Criteria
other than efficiency, such as distributional impacts, are likely
to influence the design of the emissions tax where this is the
chosen policy. Although equity considerations could be, in the-
ory, better addressed through other redistribution mechanisms,
in practice most energy and emissions taxes apply differential
tax rates to different sources.

"An emissions tax needs to be adjusted for changes in external
circumstances, like inflation, technological progress, and
increases in emissions (Tietenberg, 2000). Inflation increases
abatement costs, so to achieve a target emission reduction the
tax rate needs to be adjusted for inflation. Fixed emissions
charges in the transition economies of Eastern Europe, for
example, have been significantly eroded by the high inflation
(Bluffstone and Larson, 1997). Technological change general-
ly has the opposite effect, reducing the cost of making emis-
sions reductions. Thus, technological change generally increas-
es the emissions reductions achieved by a fixed (real) tax rate.
New sources increase emissions. If the tax is intended to
achieve a given emissions limit, the tax rate will need to be
increased to offset the impact of new sources (Tietenberg,
2000).

"Recent literature indicates that regulatory standards often pre-
cede market-based instruments and build institutional capacity
in policy evaluation, monitoring, and enforcement (Legro et
al., 1999). This is especially true in developing countries that
lack both trained personnel and the financial resources to
implement market-based instruments.”? Technology standards
have provided the initial training ground for public officials
unfamiliar with any approach to environmental regulation.
Russell and Powell (1996) found that developing countries
with a better institutional capacity developed through experi-
ence with regulatory standards generally are more successful in
implementing market-based environmental policies than less
well-equipped countries. Cole and Grossman (1998) suggest
that when historical, technological, and institutional contexts
are taken into account, technology standards are efficient in the
initial stages of environmental policy development.

effect of a direct emissions tax on end-users (CCAP, 1998).
Further, by focusing on producers and importers rather than
end-users, the number of regulated entities is dramatically
reduced. Fewer regulated entities lead to substantially lower
monitoring and enforcement costs. Modelling studies show
that taxing fossil fuels on a basis other than carbon content—for
example, energy content or value—also reduces CO, emissions,

"In addition to reducing emissions and raising revenue, a carbon
tax also influences innovation. This occurs alongside any dis-

6.2.2.6). Early work in this area indicated that auctioned per-
mits would provide the largest incentive to innovate, followed
by emissions taxes and then permits allocated free (Milliman
and Prince, 1989). More recent work demonstrates that with a
large number of competitive firms and imperfect R&D mar-
kets, taxes may induce more innovation than auctioned per-
mits, although the welfare effects remain ambiguous (Fischer
et al., 1998). The incentive for innovation is therefore a neces-
sary design consideration (Grubb et al., 1995; see Section
6.2.2.6). It has been suggested in this regard that the targetted
recycling of emissions taxes that support renewable energy and
energy efficiency activities may offer specific benefits (see

"In an open economy, countries are often concerned about the
impact of emissions taxes on tradable goods sectors (OECD,
1996a; IPCC, 1996, Section 11.6.4). In practice, therefore, cur-
rent carbon taxes generally tend to have a lower rate on the
tradable goods sectors, especially when they are energy inten-
sive. When some trading partners do not undertake emissions
reductions, for example, domestic emissions taxes on carbon-
intensive tradable goods might simply shift production to
countries without such taxes. One solution is corrective taxes
on imports and exports (OECD, 1997d). If this option is not
available (see Section 6.4.2), an emissions tax that is differen-
tiated among various sectors in the economy may be preferred
(Hoel, 1996). Another solution, which Bohringer and
Rutherford (1997) find to be more efficient, is sector-specific
wage subsidies to protect jobs in the carbon-intensive tradable
goods sector.

"Opposition to increased environmental regulation in general
often centres on concerns that firms might relocate and/or peo-
ple might lose their jobs (Rosewicz, 1990).*> Emissions taxes
are particularly vulnerable to this criticism since they require
firms not only to pay abatement costs, but also taxes on their
unabated emissions (Vollebergh er al., 1997). Several recent
papers, however, argue that emissions taxes are more cost-
effective than direct regulation and may even lead to higher
employment (Wellisch, 1995; Hoel, 1998). The intuition is that
the right to emit pollution constitutes a rent. With mobile cap-
ital markets, part of that rent accrues (inefficiently) to owners
of capital unless it is taxed (Schneider, 1998). By using the tax
revenue to offset labour taxes, employment can be higher than
in similarly designed policies using direct (technology) regula-
tion (Hoel, 1998; see also Section 6.5.1). Chapters 8 and 9 refer
to various sources corroborating the evidence that using emis-
sions and/or energy taxes to reduce distortionary labour taxes
tends to increase employment.

relatively long time. An upstream system should include provisions to

some sources need to be addressed by other policies.4° For

"47 Auctioned permits are equivalent to a tax, if adjusted with a similar
frequency, and are designed to achieve an equal emissions reduction
by the same sources. If, instead, tradable permits are allocated gratis
to certain entities, the same distribution is obtained as in the tax case
if the tax revenue is redistributed to these entities in the amount of the
wealth of the permits otherwise allocated to them (IPCC, 1996, p.
410). To redistribute the tax revenue it is necessary to confirm the total
amount of permits allocated. This means that the taxation system in
combination with the revenue redistribution inevitably involves a key
dimension of the permit trading system, so that the advantage of the
taxation system in administrative costs diminishes significantly. If the
scale of allocation for the permits in gratis is determined on the basis
of historical factors, the allocation in gratis does not reduce efficien-
cy in emissions reduction. Tax exemption and reduction, however,
may reduce or even eliminate incentives for emissions reduction and
depreciate the efficiency factor embraced in the taxation policies,
because the scale of reduction or exemption is determined by the cur-
rent emissions quantities.

"Permits can be distributed to permit-liable entities (and/or oth-
ers) gratis or by auction.‘” Gratis allocation requires a rule for
distributing the permits among the recipients. Since the permits
represent an asset transferred to the recipients it can be difficult
to find a rule that is considered fair by all. An auction raises
revenue. All of the revenue could be returned to permit-liable
entities, but this needs to be done in a manner that leaves them
with an economic incentive to reduce their emissions. The rev-
enue could also be used for a variety of other purposes.
Compensation could be provided to industries, whether or not
they are permit-liable entities, or households that bear a dis-
proportionate share of the impact. The revenue could also be
used to reduce existing distortionary taxes and so reduce the
net cost of the emission reduction policy (see Section 6.5.1).
The introduction of an emissions trading programme, like the
imposition of any new tax or regulation, imposes adjustment
costs on the affected entities. This is true whether the permits
are auctioned or distributed gratis. Moreover, some gratis allo-
cation rules discriminate against new entrants (IPCC, 1996;
Cramton and Kerr, 1998; Zhang, 2000).

favour of introducing a trigger price into a permit trading sys-

bound on the price and hence on compliance costs (See e.g.,
Kopp et al., 1999a). When the permit price reaches the trigger,
additional permits are sold by the government to prevent the
price from rising further. Such a hybrid system fails to guaran-

er design of the VA. Free riding can take place if firms that do
not comply or participate benefit from the agreement while
bearing no cost. Governments may encourage participation in
VA programmes and discourage free riders by providing incen-
tives such as permits to use labels and other marketing claims.
As for possible abuse, some or all of the participants may use
their initiating role in the process to create an agreement that
benefits them, and hence obstruct real abatement progress. It
could also involve introducing measures that benefit some
firms, and reinforces their market dominance.

Voluntary compliance was characterized by adverse selection;
units that “opted in” to the programme tended either to have
low emissions below their permitted allocations, or to have low
costs of abatement (Montero, 1999). While the VA kept aggre-
gate costs low, the adverse selection increased aggregate emis-

adverse selection and cost-savings means that the design of

"In the early 1990s, the Dutch government entered into agreements with all energy-intensive industries to improve energy efficiency.

The purpose was both to improve competitiveness by cutting energy costs and to reduce CO, emissions.

This win-win situation is

favoured by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, which was primarily responsible for the execution of the long-term agreement (LTA)
policy. Efficiency is usually defined as the ratio of relevant physical output to primary energy consumed. The target for most sectors
is to improve energy efficiency by 20% in 2000, compared to 1989. Most sectors were audited before entering into an agreement, to

ensure that the efficiency improvement was feasible. The coverage of industrial energy consumption is hig!
energy consumption is excluded. There is a similar agreement with the horticultural greenhouse sector, w
energy-consuming sector after the chemical industry. An intermediate organization co-ordinates the annual

levels. First, they are used to raise awareness of climate issues.
Governments communicate their targets and policy measures
to the public. The information may influence preferences to
contribute to GHG mitigation. Social marketing is becoming a
crucial instrument in creating an appropriate social environ-
ment for GHG emissions reduction policies (Legro et al.,
1999). Second, governments stimulate research to analyze cli-
mate issues and create mitigation opportunities that can be
widely applied. R&D generates new information on possibili-
ties and determines the technical potential. Information on the
economic situation (prices, taxes, interests rates, etc.) in turn
constrains the technical potential to what is commercially fea-
sible. Third, information instruments are used to help the
implementation of measures. They can assist the public in
making the right choices with respect to GHG mitigation.

ence the design of the emissions subsidy (or the combination
of subsidies and taxes in what is known as fee and/or rebate).
The distributional and competitiveness impacts help explain
why, in practice, some energy and emissions taxes are coupled
with tax exemptions or subsidies. Also, the use of subsidies for

on consumers’ behaviour and the introduction of clean tech-
nology. Boxes 6.5 and 6.7 provide some examples of such
developments to illustrate how these phenomena work in prac-

labelling are, first, that labels do not distort the market. Second,
in many instances they are voluntary for both the producer and
the consumer because the former is free to decide whether or
not to join the system and the consumer is free to decide
whether or not to buy the labelled product. Voluntary labels are
a non-official instrument, and may be instituted without the

labels are usually based on considerable information exchange
among the various stakeholders, which may increase the over-

administrative costs, and other socio-economic conditions
idiosyncratic to each country. For these reasons, it can be antic-

The RPS has received considerable attention in the USA. The RPS is similar to the NFFO concept in the UK, in that both are competi-
tive least-cost mechanisms. Unlike NFFO there is no funding levy. Under RPS, all retail power suppliers are required to obtain a certain
minimum percentage (e.g. 5%) of their electricity from specified renewable energy sources. Efficiency is obtained by allowing the mar-
ket to determine the most cost-effective solution for each electricity retailer (Radar, 1996; Haddad and Jefferis, 1999). State legislatures

and/or public utility commissions have approved various versions of RPS in several US states (Wiser, 1999b).

Another support mechanism to promote renewables in a liberalized electricity market is a fee/kWh on all energy users to support renew-
able energy development. This charge is often referred to as SBCs (Haddad and Jefferis, 1999). In California, a total of US$540 million

"The UK has been promoting wind and other renewable energy technologies through its Non Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO; see Mitchell,

technologies under a competitive bidding framework. Within each technology band (wind, biomass, landfills, solar, etc.) developers sub-
mit bids of proposed projects and the projects with the lowest cost/kWh price are awarded power purchase contracts. Regional electric-
ity companies are mandated to purchase power from NFFO-awarded renewable electricity generators at a premium price. The compa-
nies are reimbursed for the difference between the NFFO premium price and the average monthly power pool purchasing price through
the Fossil Fuel Levy (Mitchell, 1995a). The main weakness of the NFFO is that the implementation rate of approved projects is very low,
because bids have such low cost/kWh that they do not allow the profitable operation of projects. Moreover, the intermittent character of
NFFO rounds has precluded the development of a steady domestic market for renewable technologies (Michaelowa, 2000).

"Support for wind energy in the Netherlands has included both R&D grants and a variety of market-stimulation mechanisms. These
have included an integrated programme for wind energy, which provided subsidies of 35-40% of investment costs for newly built tur-
bines. Electricity distribution companies raised environmental levies to purchase wind generated kiloWatt hours for high guaranteed
prices (about US$0.07; Wolsink, 1996). More recently, however, significant changes have occurred in the Dutch renewable energy pol-
icy, reinforced by the liberalization of the electricity market. Most of the direct subsidies are now eliminated and other market-orient-
ed and fiscal mechanisms introduced. One such mechanism is the green certificates market, which started in 1998. By law, local ener-
gy distribution companies must purchase renewable electricity from independent power generators. Distribution companies issue
green certificates to the renewable generators equal to the amount of renewable kiloWatt hours sold to the grid. The renewable gen-
erator can then sell these green certificates on an open market to distribution companies that want to sell green-certified electricity
(Schaeffer et al., 1999). Green electricity is exempt from energy taxes, which will be raised to about US$0.06/kWh in 2001. The tax
exemption makes wind energy competitive with electricity from conventional sources, and thus the subsidies are obsolete.

al-level programmes for RE technologies have been initiated, for example, the National Project for Biogas Development (NPBD) with
a target of 1.5 million plants by 2001, a national programme for improved cook-stoves, a programme for mass demonstration of RE
sources like wind, solar, biomass, efc. The Ministry of Non-conventional Energy Sources (MNES) co-ordinates and implements the

each country should receive. Harmonized domestic taxes avoid
this difficulty by letting each country keep the revenue it col-
lects. In practice, it is difficult also to achieve agreement on
minimum levels of harmonized carbon and/or energy taxes
high enough to impact carbon emissions significantly. Political
pressures to combine tax proposals with exemptions for spe-

"International or harmonized taxes provide greater certainty
about the likely costs of an emissions reduction programme,
compared with a similarly designed international emissions
trading programme (Toman et al., 1999). This advantage can
also be obtained by a hybrid policy, consisting of domestic
emissions trading programmes coupled with a harmonized
“trigger price”, at which countries would sell additional per-
mits domestically (McKibbin and Wilcoxen, 2000). The hybrid
policy sets an upper bound on the marginal cost of abatement
(like a carbon tax), but otherwise operates like an emissions
trading programme. For a discussion of the pros and cons of
such a hybrid system, see Sections 6.2.2.2 and 6.2.2.3.

potentially cost-effective means of obtaining CO, reductions
(IPCC, 1996, 11.2.2.2).7> By associating a uniform price with
carbon emissions in every country, only reductions that cost
less than the tax will be implemented, assuming that the tax is
implemented perfectly. To provide a common price signal in all
countries, the new carbon tax may need to be differentiated
across countries to account for existing domestic fuel taxes and
revenue constraints (Hoel, 1993). Providing a common price
signal to all sources subject to the tax also requires that all
countries refrain from policies that directly or indirectly offset
the tax (such as subsidies or regulations).

technology transfer within and across national boundaries.
Although many ESTs are in common use and could be diffused
through commercial channels, their spread is hampered by
risks such as those arising from weak legal protection and inad-
equate regulation in developed and developing countries.
However, many technologies that can mitigate emissions or
contribute to adaptation to climate change have not yet been
commercialized. Beyond an enabling environment, it will take
extra efforts to enhance the transfer of those ESTs (IPCC,
2000). It should also be recognized that the effective transfer of
ESTs requires substantial upgrading of the technological
capacities in the developing countries (TERI, 1997) (see also
Chapters 5 and 10).

"In fact, Agenda 21 (UN, 1992) states that “governments and
international organizations should promote effective modalities
for the access and transfer of environmentally sustainable tech-

tion of policies and programmes for the effective transfer of
ESTs that are publicly owned or in the public domain.” The
major role of the government could be to supply EST research
and develop funds to transfer publicly owned technology to
developing countries. In this regard, the Commission on
Sustainable Development, at its fifth session, concluded that: “a
proportion of technology is held or owned by Governments and
public institutions or results from publicly-funded research and
development activities. The Government’s control and influ-
ence over the technological knowledge produced in publicly-
funded research and development institutions opens up a poten-
tial for the generation of publicly-owned technologies that
could be made accessible to developing countries, and could be
an important means for Governments to catalyze private sector
technology transfer.” In all countries the role of publicly fund-
ed R&D in the development of ESTs is significant. Through
both policy and public funding, the public sector continues to
be an important driver in the development of ESTs.

This means that the standards may be effective as tools to cope

"The first concern is that price-based policies (taxes or
hybrid systems) fail to guarantee particular emissions
levels if it is not possible to adjust the tax rate frequent-
ly to achieve emission reductions in accordance with the
set targets. If one assumes, for instance, that taxes are
the only instrument used to fulfil the Kyoto Protocol
commitments, in practice they most likely cannot guar-
antee that emissions commitments will be fulfilled
either in the aggregate and/or for individual countries.
The second concern is that an international agreement
involving international or domestically harmonized
taxes may be more difficult to negotiate than one
involving emissions quotas. Wiener (1998) argues that
the voluntary assent nature of international agreements
means that nations must be made better off to partici-
pate, unlike domestic policies for which individuals can
be coerced. While in theory international or domesti-
cally harmonized taxes can be combined with side
payments to compensate losers, in practice such side
payments are difficult to negotiate and tend to intro-
duce dynamic inefficiencies since individual firms (and
countries) do not bear the full social cost of their
activities (Mestelman, 1982; Baumol and Oates, 1988;

obvious way in which international agreements seek to increase

This is an article that specifies the agreement will not be bind-
ing on any of its Parties until a large enough number of coun-
tries—and, sometimes, particular countries or types of coun-
tries—have ratified the agreement. The minimum participation
clause effectively makes the obligations of each of its signato-

"The point, however, is that while agreements must offer some
alternative means for deterring free-riding, often they do not.
The literature on international environmental agreements
therefore predicts that participation will be incomplete, and it
often is. One of the few agreements that disproves this general
rule is the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that deplete
the ozone layer (UNEP, 1987; revised and amended in 1990
and 1992). The revised Protocol contains provisions that con-
trol trade between Parties and non-Parties to the regime.
Coupled with the financial resources available to developing
countries Parties that are not available to non-Parties, the
Party—non-Party trade provisions are widely cited as a major
factor in explaining the near universal participation in the
ozone regime (Rowlands, 1995). See also Chapter 10 for a fur-

Parties to endow international bodies with legal authority to
enforce the international commitments Parties have (freely)

mechanisms is greatly reduced. If access to the Kyoto mecha-
nisms is given to individual sources, there arises the potential for
a second principal-agent problem in that individual entities may
mitigate in ways that minimize private costs but fail to minimize
social costs in the national economy. In this case, both interna-
tional efficiency and domestic efficiency are jeopardized.

"Trade-related environmental measures traditionally pose prob-
lems for the multilateral trading regime. Considerations of sov-
ereignty favour the autonomy of WTO Parties to set health or
environmental standards for all products, domestic or imported,
consumed in their national territories. Each country has broad
discretion to introduce its own policies and measures, including
energy efficiency standards and import restrictions, to protect its
environment and/or its people’s health, subject to GATT Article
3 (national treatment). However, more debatable is whether
GATT permits a government to place restrictions or bans on the
import of goods or services, themselves not dangerous or pol-
luting, that are produced outside its borders through PPMs that
do not meet its national environmental regulations or standards.
PPM issues may be characterized as “clean products produced
through dirty processes”. As MEAs increasingly utilize trade
measures to prevent non-members from free-riding, the consis-
tency of such trade measures with the relevant GATT articles
(Article XX, in particular) has been questioned when they are
based on the lack of corresponding PPM requirements in the
exporting countries (Murase, 1995, 1996). At present, the rela-
tion between WTO-compatible environmental measures and
MEAs remains unsettled. It is also unclear whether WTO law is
neutral in its treatment of alternative trade-related measures
(e.g., standards, taxes, and subsidies).

valid even though there was no transboundary damage outside the
nation of origin (World Trade Organization, 1988). A border tax on
shrimp caught with turtle-unsafe methods and similar to a domestic
tax on such products would seem to fall under this rule. Products that
have been produced through differential production methods, like
products that have different environmental qualities in themselves,
have usually been considered to be not “like products” and therefore
allowable objects of differential, non-discriminatory taxes (Demaret

ed in the scientific literature (Jackson, 2000). In either case, the
ruling did not refer to important questions relevant to the inter-
action of WTO and the UNFCCC and/or Kyoto Protocol. It is
unclear whether national PPMs need only be enacted by Parties
to an MEA in their compliance programmes, or whether each
particular PPM, its mode of application, and/or its sanction

"The GATT Panel rulings in the Tuna—Dolphin | dispute read
Articles XXb and XXg so as to preclude provisional justifica-

destructive to the system of international trade. The panel in

shrimp embargo belonged to the class of measures (PPMs) that
threatened the multilateral trading system and therefore violat-
ed the terms of the Chapeau of Article XX. However, the WTO
Appellate Body overruled the Panel’s view in the
Shrimp-Turtle case. The WTO indicated implicitly that it does
not categorically disallow the use of extrajurisdictional
PPMs.” Although the import restrictions in question applied to
shrimp harvesting practices and not to any characteristic of the
shrimps themselves, the Appellate Body treated the measure as
provisionally justifiable. It considered the legality of the spe-
cific restrictions, which were held to be invalid under the pro-
hibition of the Chapeau of Article XX of discriminatory and
arbitrary measures. The US embargo was ruled overly broad,
its enforcement inflexible in considering the conservation
effects of other nations’ shrimping practices, disparate in its
treatment of other nations, deficient in due process, and put
into effect without sufficient good-faith efforts to secure wider
multilateral acceptance of its exclusionary programme (Berger,

"Various partial equilibrium models have been designed to ana-
lyze ecological dumping, many using static or dynamic game
theory. Early analyses used a Cournot setting, which models
long-run competition among firms as a series of strategic
capacity or output choices. The general conclusion from these
early models is that the optimal tax (or any comparable domes-
tic environmental policy instrument) would be set below mar-
ginal damage. As a consequence, environmental policies are
designed to try to protect domestic industries. If producers col-
lude, however, the incentive for governments to engage in eco-
logical dumping is reduced (Ulph, 1993).

subsidize indirectly particular imperfectly competitive industries

which is possible but not required in the Kyoto Protocol, except
insofar as the Kyoto mechanisms are concerned. !0!

"Early empirical research on the impact of environmental poli-
cy on trade found little evidence of a measurable relationship,
partly because of low environmental taxes and partly through
data and statistical limitations. Therefore, many studies have
concentrated on simulations of environmental tax regimes.
From a survey of these studies, IPCC’s SAR (IPCC, 1996) con-
cluded that estimates of the effects of environmental policies
(notably carbon taxes) on trade vary wildly, depending on
model parameters (such as energy demand elasticities and
assumptions regarding the substitutability of traded goods) and
the policy scenario examined (extent of reduction in emissions
and extent of international co-ordination).

"Under certain ideal conditions (e.g., perfect competition in all
markets) there is theoretically no need for international policy
co-ordination (Oates and Schwab, 1988). However, such condi-

kets or unemployment (Rauscher, 1991, 1994; Barrett, 1994;
Kennedy, 1994; A. Ulph, 1994; D. Ulph, 1994). If, and to what
extent, international differences in environmental regulation
have trade or even relocation implications obviously depends on
a host of factors. These include country size, availability of
alternatives, relative resource endowment, mobility of produc-
tion factors, competition level, scope for innovation, possibility
of border-tax adjustment, chances of retaliation, and redistribu-
tion of environmental tax revenues (OECD, 1996a).

"The ecological dumping conclusion could change completely
if governments act strategically in setting taxes, and if there is
Bertrand competition (firms compete by choosing the price to
charge, rather than the quantity to produce) instead of Cournot
competition (Eaton and Grossman, 1986; Barrett, 1994;
Conrad, 1996; Ulph, 1996). If, however, producers act strate-
gically or can collude, then the outcome in terms of ecological
dumping is not straightforward. Quantity-based environmental
regulation, if implemented unilaterally in a duopolistic case
with a domestic and foreign supplier, might actually benefit
domestic firms at the cost of domestic consumers (Kooiman,
1998). If both governments and producers act strategically,
again, the incentive for governments to distort the environ-
mental policy is less than when only governments acted strate-
gically, so that the Bertrand outcome can be similar to the
Cournot outcome (Ulph, 1996).

"Although it is clear that many factors affect the relationship
between the stringency of pollution control policies (if imple-

ined 19 US manufacturing industries between 1973 and 1990
with the help of regression analysis. They found the relation-
ship between pollution abatement costs and net exports to be
negative in most of the sample period, but diminishing over
time (with elasticities close to zero in many industries). Van
Beers and Van den Bergh (1997), using a gravity model of
international trade and two measures of environmental strin-
gency, did not find a significant relationship between environ-
mental stringency and total exports for the “dirty” industries.
However, when they focused on the non-resource based, and
therefore more “mobile”, industries only this relationship was
significant.

serious consideration of the equity implication of that policy
(Morrisette and Plantinga, 1991). Unlike efficiency, there is no
universal consensus definition of equity by which policy
instruments can be evaluated. Recent research on equity, how-
ever, analyzed the welfare impacts of climate policy alterna-

countries and regions) of various policy instruments (Bohm

"Alternatively, with a common global carbon tax and full par-

unevenly across the world and would change with time. A large
burden would fall on OECD and economies in transition in the
early years, shifting to developing nations in later years
(Edmonds et al., 1995). Transition economies would thus be
unlikely to participate in a common global carbon tax agree-
ment. If such nations were to participate in the short run,
growth and changing economic and political circumstances
may increase the probability of their dropping out of a tax
agreement when they face increasing net participation costs
(Edmonds et al., 1995).

"If quota allocations are used to induce participation by transi-
tion economies and developing countries, the international
wealth transfers that occur as a result may cause fluctuations in
real exchange rates and international capital and trade flows
(McKibbin and Wilcoxen, 1997a, 1997b). The magnitude of
these fluctuations and the extent to which they could be prob-
lematic are uncertain. McKibbin and Wilcoxen (2000) suggest
an alternative approach to the problem of equity versus partic-
ipation incentive, which includes both short-run emissions
quota and long-run emissions “endowments”. In this approach,
the price of emissions quota is set through international nego-
tiation at regular intervals (they suggest every decade), and
each country issues as many quotas as necessary to keep the
price at the negotiated level. The price of emissions endow-
ments, however, is flexible, and the quantity allowed per coun-
try is fixed. Each participating country’s endowment prices
reflect expected future prices of emissions quota.

"Bohm and Larsen (1994) explore the participation implications
of two of the more frequently discussed of the allocation
schemes listed in Table 6.3 (allocation by population and by
GDP) for a quota regime covering Western Europe and Eastern
Europe. Both of these allocations, and combinations thereof, lead
to substantial losses by the Eastern European countries, making
their participation unlikely (Bohm and Larsen, 1994). Given the
aggregate cost-savings associated with their participation, an
ideal allocation system would provide the minimum possible
participation incentive to the Eastern European countries, while
maximizing potential abatement cost savings to the western
countries. The authors identify this lower bound in terms of east-
em country quota-to-emissions ratios that would induce partici-
pation, ranging among countries from 0.85 to 0.91. This incen-
tive scenario results in zero net gains (losses) to the eastern coun-
tries, and net costs to each western country of 0.09% of GDP. In
the presence of wide disparity in current regional economic wel-
fare, the perceived equity benefits of such a scenario may facili-
tate a more cost-effective agreement than any that might be
achieved without Eastern European participation.!°

"In the long run, the development and widespread adoption of
new technologies can greatly ameliorate what, in the short run,
sometimes appear to be overwhelming conflicts between eco-
nomic well being and environmental quality. Therefore, the
effect of public policies on the development and spread of new
technologies may be among the most important determinants
of success or failure in environmental protection (Kneese and
Schultze, 1975).

"For policies that raise revenue for the government, carbon
taxes and auctioned permits, this is only part of the story, how-
ever. These revenues can be recycled to reduce existing distor-
tionary taxes. Thus, to attain a given GHG emissions target,
revenue-generating policy instruments have the advantage of a
potential cost-reducing “revenue-recycling effect’ as com-
pared to the alternative, non-auctioned tradable permits or
other non-revenue-generating instruments (Bohm, 1998). For a
more complete theoretical discussion, see Chapter 7, and see
Chapter 8 for the empirical results.

"Governments often seek to influence each of these directly, by
investment in public research, subsidies to research and tech-
nological development, dissemination of information, and
other means (Mowery and Rosenberg, 1989). Policies with
large economic impacts, such as those intended to address
global climate change, can be designed to foster technological
invention, innovation, and diffusion (Kemp and Soete, 1990).
For the impact of R&D policies on technology development
and transfer, see the IPCC Special Report on Technology
Transfer (IPCC, 2000).

"The cost-increasing interaction reflects the impact that GHG
policies can have on the functioning of labour and capital mar-
kets through their effects on real wages and the real return to
capital (see, e.g., Parry et al., 1999). By restricting the allow-
able GHG emissions, permits, regulations, or a carbon tax raise
the costs of production and the price of output, thus reducing
the real return to labour and capital, and exacerbating prior dis-
tortions in the labour and capital markets. Thus, to attain a
given GHG emissions target, before or after use of IET and
other Kyoto mechanisms, all the instruments have a cost-
increasing “interaction effect”.
"	Text
"It is important to consider how the domestic policy instruments
examined in this chapter may interact with existing fiscal sys-
tems, because such interactions can have significant effects on
the overall costs of achieving specified GHG emissions reduc-
tion targets. A growing literature demonstrates theoretically,
and with numerical simulation models, that the costs of
addressing GHG targets with policy instruments of all
kinds—command-and-control as well as market-based
approaches—can be greater than anticipated because of the
interaction of these policy instruments with existing domestic
tax systems.!0° Domestic taxes on labour and investment
income change the economic returns to labour and capital, and
distort the efficient use of these resources.
"	Text
"To examine the link between policy instruments and techno-
logical change, environmental policies can be characterized as
market-based approaches, performance standards, technology
standards, and voluntary agreements. All these forms of inter-
vention have the potential to induce or force some amount of
technological change, because by their very nature they induce
or require firms to do things they would not otherwise do.
Performance and technology standards can be explicitly
designed to be “technology forcing”, mandating performance
levels that are not currently viewed as technologically feasible
or mandating technologies that are not fully developed. The
problem with this approach can be that while regulators typi-
cally assume that some amount of improvement over existing
technology will always be feasible, it is impossible to know
how much. Standards must either be made not very ambitious,
or else run the risk of being ultimately unachievable, which
leads to great political and economic disruption (Freeman and
Haveman, 1972). However, in the case of obstructed technolo-
gy, regulators know quite well the technology improvements
that are feasible. Thus, although the problem of standards
being either too low or too ambitious remains a possibility, it
does not make standards inherently incapable of implementing
some portion of the available technology base, and to do so
cost-effectively on the basis of cost-benefit tests.!°

"	Title
"107 Zerbe (1970) couches his research in terms of adoption. Downing
and White (1986) frame their work in terms of innovation. Milliman
and Prince (1989) use one model to discuss both diffusion and inno-
vation, the latter being defined essentially as the initial use of the tech-
nology by an “innovating” firm. Malueg (1989) presents the same
framework as a model of adoption. Jung ef al. (1996) present their
model as one of either adoption or innovation.
"	Text
"108 Related to this is the finding of Parry (1998) that the welfare gain
induced by an emissions tax is significantly greater than that induced

 

by other policies only for very major innovations. Also related is
Montero’s (2000c) conclusion that the relative superiority of alterna-
tive policy instruments in terms of their effects on firm investments in
R&D depends upon the nature of the underlying market structure.
This is implied by Laffont and Tirole (1996).

"Beginning, then, with empirical analyses of the effects of envi-
ronmental policy instruments on technology diffusion, Jaffe
and Stavins (1995) conducted econometric analyses of the fac-
tors that affected the adoption of thermal insulation technolo-

"Several researchers have found that the incentive to adopt new
technologies is greater under market-based instruments than
under direct regulation (Downing and White, 1986; Jung et al.,
1996; Milliman and Prince, 1989; Zerbe, 1970). This view is
tempered by Malueg (1989), who points out that the adoption
incentive under a freely allocated tradable permits system
depends on whether a firm is a buyer or seller of permits. For
permit buyers, the incentive is larger under a performance stan-
dard than under tradable permits.

"Empirical analyses! of the relative effects of alternative envi-
ronmental policy instruments on the rate and direction of tech-
nological change are limited in number, but those available
focus on technological change in energy efficiency, and thus
are potentially of direct relevance to global climate policy.
These studies can be considered within the three stages of tech-
nological change introduced above-invention, innovation, and
diffusion. It is most illuminating, however, to consider the
three stages in reverse order.
"	Text
"Most of the work in the environmental economics literature on
the dynamic effects of policy instruments on technological
change has been theoretical, rather than empirical, and the the-
oretical literature is considered first. The predominant theoret-
ical framework involves what could be called the “discrete
technology choice” model. In this, firms contemplate the use of
a certain technology that reduces the marginal costs of pollu-
tion abatement and that has a known fixed cost (Downing and
White, 1986; Jung et al., 1996; Malueg, 1989; Milliman and
Prince, 1989; Zerbe, 1970).
"	Text
"On the basis of an analytical and numerical comparison of the
welfare impacts of alternative policy instruments in the pres-
ence of endogenous technological change, Fischer et al. (1998)
argue that the relative ranking of policy instruments depends
critically on firms’ ability to imitate innovations, innovation
costs, environmental benefit functions, and the number of
firms that produce emissions.!°* Finally, the study includes an
explicit model of the final output market, and finds that it
depends upon empirical values of the relevant parameters
whether (auctioned) permits or taxes provide a stronger incen-
tive to adopt an improved technology.
"	Text
"Comparisons among market-based instruments are less consis-
tent. Downing and White (1986), who consider the case of a
single (sole) polluter, argue that taxes and tradable permit sys-
tems are essentially equivalent. On the other hand, Milliman
and Prince (1989) find that auctioned permits provide the
largest adoption incentive of any instrument, with emissions
taxes and subsidies second, and freely allocated permits and
direct controls last. Jung et al. (1996) consider heterogeneous
firms, and model the “market-level incentive” created by vari-
ous instruments. This measure is simply the aggregate cost sav-
ings to the industry as a whole from adopting the technology.
Their rankings echo those of Milliman and Prince (1989).
"	Text
"While some authors present this approach as a model of inno-
vation, it is perhaps more useful as a model of adoption.!°” The
adoption decision is one in which firms face a given technolo-
gy with a known fixed cost and certain consequences, and must
decide whether or not to use it; this corresponds precisely to
the discrete technology choice model. Innovation, on the other
hand, involves choices about research and development expen-
ditures, with some uncertainty over the technology that will
result and the costs of developing it. Models of innovation
allow firms to choose their research and development expendi-
tures, as in Magat (1978, 1979), or incorporate uncertainty over
the outcome of research (Biglaiser and Horowitz, 1995;
Biglaiser et al., 1995).
"	Text
"Finally, recent research investigates the combined effect of the
pollution externality and the positive externality that results
from learning-by-doing with mitigation technologies. Since the
benefit from learning occurs after the learning has taken place,
a dynamic analysis is needed. Some analyses shown that
dynamic efficiency (discounted least cost, aggregated over
time) requires that the incentive for emissions-mitigating inno-
vations be set higher than the penalty on emissions, especial-
ly if account is taken of “leakage”. This is in contrast with the
conclusions of comparative static analysis upon which most
environmental policy analysis is grounded (e.g., Baumol and
Oates, 1988), under which the two incentives should be equal
in all time periods (for a formal analysis, see Read (1999,
2000)).

"An optimal set of policies would be designed in such a way as
to achieve two outcomes simultaneously: release any obstruct-
ed emission and cost-reduction potentials from already avail-
able technologies through various market reforms that try to
reduce market distortions (see IPCC, 2000), and induce the
accelerated development of new technologies. This approach
allows significant carbon abatement over the near-term by dif-
fusing existing technologies, while at the same time preparing
new technologies for the longer term.
"	Text
"This and other research on energy efficiency programmes also
highlights a major difference in the way energy price signals
and technology subsidies function. The technology adoption
response to taxes may include a_ secondary increase in the
demand for energy services. This secondary effect takes two
forms: a direct effect that results from the increased utilization
of energy-using equipment and capital stocks, and an indirect
effect from increased disposable income. Studies of such
demand effects suggest that the combined effects are general-
ly not sufficient to offset more than a minor portion of emis-
sions reductions.
"	Text
"Some recent empirical studies suggest that the response of rel-
evant technological change to energy price changes can be sur-
prisingly swift. Typically, this is less than 5 years for much of
the response in terms of patenting activity and the introduction
of new model offerings (Jaffe and Stavins, 1995; Newell et al.,
1999; Poppe, 1999). Substantial diffusion can sometimes take
longer, depending on the rate of retirement of previously
installed equipment. The longevity of much energy-using
equipment reinforces the importance of taking a longer-term
view towards energy-efficiency improvements—on the order of
decades.
"	Text
"Over the past 25 years an extensive literature, including pro-
gramme evaluation, value-for-money audits, and comprehen-
sive audits, has developed on the evaluation of government
programmes. Much of this literature is specific to the type of
programme-low-income housing, training, employment cre-
ation, policing, transit, energy efficiency, etc.—and has little rel-
evance to the monitoring and evaluation of policies for climate
change mitigation. However, the literature also includes
numerous evaluations of energy-efficiency, DSM, emissions
trading, environmental taxes, and other programmes that could
provide useful insights into the design, monitoring, and evalu-
ation of climate change policies.

"energy prices can be interpreted as suggesting what the likely
effects of taxes on energy use would be, and the effects of
changes in adoption costs can be interpreted as indicating what
the effects of technology-adoption subsidies would be. They
found that the response of mean energy efficiency to energy
price changes was positive and significant, both statistically
and economically. Interestingly, they also found that equivalent
percentage cost subsidies would have been about three times as
effective as taxes in encouraging adoption, although standard
financial analysis suggest they ought to be about equal in per-
centage terms. This finding does, however, offer confirmation
for the conventional wisdom that technology adoption deci-
sions are more sensitive to up-front cost considerations than to
longer-term operating expenses.

"Theoretically, it is unnecessary to monitor and evaluate nation-
al policies and programmes to see whether Annex I Parties ful-
fil their Kyoto commitments, provided national communica-
tions give a clear and reliable picture of the net impact of those
actions on the net national GHG emissions and net uptake via
sinks. Indeed, national inventories, usually updated on an
annual basis, are the backbone of the monitoring system. Of
course, governments might want to monitor the impact of their
own policies for domestic assessment purposes. To meet the
international commitments, such monitoring, however, would
not be necessary if monitoring at the aggregate level were com-
pletely reliable. However, this may not be true. Evidence sug-
gests that there can be a considerable margin of error in the
national data provided to the UNFCCC Secretariat within the
framework of the national communications.

"In a study of residential conservation investment tax credits,
Hassett and Metcalf (1995) also found that tax credit or deduc-
tions were many times more effective than “equivalent”
changes in energy prices—about eight times as effective in their
study. They speculate that one reason for this difference is that
energy price movements may be perceived as temporary. The
findings by Jaffe and Stavins (1995), and by Hasset and
Metcalf (1995) are consistent with other analyses of the rela-
tive effectiveness of energy prices and technology market
reforms in bringing about the adoption of lifecycle cost-saving
technologies. Up-front subsidies can be more effective than
energy price signals (see, e.g., Krause ef al., 1993; Howarth
and Winslow, 1994; IPSEP, 1995; Eto et al., 1996; Golove and
Eto, 1995; IPCC, 1996, Executive Summary, p. 13). A disad-
vantage of such non-price policies relative to administered
prices is that they have to be implemented on an “end-use by
end-use” or “sector by sector” basis in a customized fashion.
Also, an effective institutional and regulatory framework
needs to be created and maintained to evaluate and ensure the
continued cost-effectiveness of such policies.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
"	Title
"First, defining the baseline is a key part of cost assessment.
The baseline is the GHG emissions that would occur in the
"	Text
"Third, for a wide variety of options, the costs of mitigation
depend on the regulatory framework adopted by national gov-
ernments to reduce GHGs. The more flexibility allowed by the
framework, the lower the costs of achieving a given reduction.
More flexibility and more trading partners can reduce costs, as
a firm can search out the lowest-cost alternative. The opposite
is expected with inflexible rules and few trading partners.
"	Text
"Second, climate change policies may have a number of side-
impacts on local and regional air pollution associated, and indi-
rect effects on issues such as transportation, agriculture, land
use practices, employment, and fuel security. These side-
impacts can be negative as well as positive and the inclusion of
the impacts then can tend to generate higher as well as lower
climate change mitigation costs compared with studies that do
not include such side-impacts.
"	Text
"The costs of climate protection are affected by decisions on
some key elements, the analytical structure, and the assump-
tions made. Among other key presumptions, these include the
definition of the baseline, assumption about associated costs
and benefits that arise in conjunction with GHG emission
reduction policies, the flexibility available to find the carbon
emissions of lowest cost, the possibility of no regret options,
the discount rate, the assumption of the rate of autonomous
technological change, and whether revenue is recycled.
"	Text
"absence of climate change interventions. It helps determine
how expensive GHG emissions reduction might be. The base-
line rests on key assumptions about future economic policies
at the macroeconomic and sectoral levels, including structure,
resource intensity, relative prices, technology choice, and the
rate of technology adoption. The baseline also depends on pre-
sumptions of future development patterns in the economy, like
population growth, economic growth, and technological
change.
"	Text
"Using resources to mitigate greenhouse gases (GHGs) gener-
ates opportunity costs that should be considered to help guide
reasonable policy decisions. Actions to abate GHG emissions
or increase carbon sinks divert resources from other uses like
health care and education. Assessing these costs should con-
sider the total value that society attaches to the goods and ser-
vices forgone because of the diversion of resources to climate
protection. In some cases, the benefits of mitigation could
exceed the costs, and thus society gains from mitigation.
"	Text
"Fourth, no regrets options are by definition actions to reduce
GHG emissions that have negative net costs. Net costs are neg-
ative because these options generate direct or indirect benefits
large enough to offset the costs to implement the options. The
existence of no regrets potential implies that people choose not
to exercise some carbon-reducing options because of relative
prices and preferences, or that some markets and institutions do
not behave perfectly. The presumption of effective policies that
capture large no regrets options reduces costs.
"	Text
"Fifth, there are two approaches to discounting—an ethical or
prescriptive approach based on what rates of discount should
be applied, and a descriptive approach based on what rates of
discount people (savers as well as investors) actually apply in
their day-to-day decisions. For mitigation analysis, the country
must base its decisions at least partly on discount rates that
reflect the opportunity cost of capital. Rates that range from
4% to 6% would probably be justified in developed countries.
The rate could be as high as 10%—12% in developing countries.
It is more of a challenge to argue that climate change mitiga-
tion projects should face different rates, unless the mitigation
project is of very long duration. Note that these rates do not
"	Text
"While the underlying measures of welfare have limits and
using monetary values remains controversial, the view is taken
that the methods to “convert” non-market inputs into monetary
terms provide useful information for policymakers. These
methods should be pursued when and where appropriate. It is
also considered useful to supplement this welfare-based cost
methodology with a broader assessment that includes physical
impacts when possible. In practice, the challenge is to develop
a consistent and comprehensive definition of the key impacts
to be measured. In this chapter the costing methodology is
overviewed, and issues involved in using these methods
addressed.
"	Text
"This chapter addresses the methodological issues that arise in
the estimation of the monetary costs of climate change. The
focus is on the correct assessment of the costs of mitigation
measures to reduce the emissions of GHGs. The assessment of
costs and benefits should be based on a systematic analytical
framework to ensure comparability of estimates and trans-
parency of logic. One well-developed framework assesses
costs as changes in social welfare based on individual values.
These individual values are reflected by the willingness to pay
(WTP) for environmental improvements or their willingness to
accept (WTA) compensation. From these value measures can
be derived measures such as the social surpluses gained or lost
from a policy, the total resource costs, and opportunity costs.
"	Text
"Given these presumptions on structure, the costs of climate
protection can be modelled and assessed at three levels:
"	Text
"reflect private rates of return, which typically must be greater
to justify a project, at around 10%-25%.
"	Text
"In addition, several issues on technology use in developing
countries and economies in transition (EITs) warrant attention
as critical determinants for climate change mitigation potential
and related costs. These include current technological develop-
ment levels, technology transfer issues, capacity for innovation
and diffusion, barriers to efficient technology use, institutional
structure, and human capacity aspects.
"	Text
"Modelling climate mitigation strategies can be done using sev-
eral techniques, including input-output models, macroeco-
nomic models, computable general equilibrium models, and
models based on the energy sector. Hybrid models have also
been developed to provide more detail on the structure of the
economy and the energy sector. Two broad classes of integrat-
ed assessment models can be identified: policy optimization
models and policy evaluation models. The appropriate use of
these models depends on the subject of the evaluation and the
availability of data.
"	Text
"Finally, the main categories of climate change mitigation poli-
cies include market-oriented, technology-oriented, voluntary,
and research and development (R&D) policies. Climate change
mitigation policies can include elements of two or more policy
options. Economic models, for example, mainly assess market-
oriented policies and in some cases technology policies, pri-
marily those related to energy supply options. In contrast, engi-
neering approaches mainly focus on supply and demand-side
technology policies. Both approaches are relatively weak in the
representation of R&D policies.
"	Text
"Equity is another issue in evaluating mitigation policies. The
use of income weights is one approach to address equity.
Under this system each dollar of costs imposed on a person
with low income is given greater weight relative to the cost for
a person with a high income. This method is, however, con-
troversial and it is difficult to obtain agreement on the weights
to be used. An alternative method is to report the distribution-
al impacts separately. In this case it is important that all the
key stakeholders are identified and the distributional effects on
each reported. A third possibility is to use average damage
estimates and apply these to all those impacted, irrespective of
their actual WTP.
"	Text
" 

Project level analysis estimates costs using “stand-
alone” investments assumed to have minor secondary
impacts on markets.

Sector level analysis estimates costs using a “partial-
equilibrium” model, in which other variables are pre-
sumed as given.

Macroeconomic analysis estimates costs by consider-
ing how policies affect all sectors and markets, using
various macroeconomic and general equilibrium mod-
els. The modeller confronts the trade-off between the
level of detail in the cost assessment and complexity of
the system. For example, a macroeconomic system tries
to capture all direct and indirect impacts, with little
detail on the impacts of specific smaller scale projects.
"	List
"Sixth, modellers account for the penetration of technological
change over time through a technical coefficient called the
“autonomous energy efficiency improvement” (AEEI). AEEI
reflects the rate of change in the energy intensity (the ratio of
energy to gross domestic product) holding energy prices con-
stant. The presumed autonomous technological improvement
in the energy intensity of an economy can lead to significant
differences in the estimated costs of mitigation. As such, many
observers view the choice of AEEI as crucial in setting the
baseline in which to judge the costs of mitigation. The costs of
mitigation are inversely related the AEEI-a greater AEEI the
lower the costs to reach any given climate target. The costs
decrease because people adopt low-carbon technology unre-
lated to changes in relative prices.
"	Text
"Other issues to be considered in the assessment of mitigation
policies include the marginal cost of public funds, capital costs,
and side effects. Policies such as carbon taxes or auctioned
(tradable) carbon-emissions permits generate revenues that can
be recycled to reduce other taxes that are likely to be distor-
tionary. There has been considerable debate as to whether such
revenue recycling might eliminate the economic costs of such
mitigation policies. Theoretical studies indicate that this result
can occur in economies with highly inefficient tax systems.
Some empirical studies obtain the no-cost result, although
many such studies do not. Tax recycling reflects several com-
plicated assumptions in the baseline and policy case regarding
the structure of the tax system and the overall policy frame-
work, among others. Target setting and timing also affect cost
estimates. Reduction targets defined as percentage reductions
of future GHG emissions create significant uncertainty about
GHG emission levels.

"IPCC’s SAR published a separate volume on the economic and
social dimensions of climate change (IPCC, 1996a). This report
considered all aspects of climate change, including impacts,
adaptation, and mitigation of climate change. The volume on
economic and social dimensions was supplemented by a report
from another working group of the IPCC that dealt with scien-
tific and technical analyses of the impacts, adaptation, and mit-
igation of climate change (IPCC, 1996b). The Third
Assessment Report (TAR) is structured in a different way.
Impacts and adaptation are addressed together by one working
group (WGII), and mitigation by another group (WGIID. All
the technical areas, including scientific, engineering, economic,
and social aspects of climate change impacts, adaptation, and
mitigation, however, are integrated in the working groups.

"This chapter addresses the methodological issues that arise in
the estimation of the monetary costs of climate change. The
focus here is on the correct assessment of the costs of mitiga-
tion measures to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases
(GHGs). The other two areas in which cost issues arise are the
estimation of the climate change impacts in monetary terms,
and the assessment of measures to adapt to climate change.
Working Group II (WGII) is charged with the responsibility to
evaluate the impacts and adaptation measures. It is important,
though, that much of the discussion in this chapter is relevant
to these areas. The basic principles of cost estimation certainly
apply in all three areas. Moreover, some of the key issues in
cost estimation that arise in the assessment of impacts are also
relevant to the estimation of the costs of mitigation. Hence, the
relationship between the costs discussed by WGII and those
discussed by WGIII is close.

"The chapter begins by providing the background to this assess-
ment report; by giving a summary of the Second Assessment
Report (SAR) and of the developments in the literature since
SAR (IPCC, 1996a, 1996b). Section 7.2 discusses the elements
in any climate change cost estimation. It begins by setting out
the decision-making framework for mitigation decisions.
Unfortunately, this framework is complex, as it involves the
application of different modelling techniques and assumptions.
Important within the framework are issues of ancillary and co-
benefits of climate change mitigation, evaluation techniques,
the treatment of barrier removal and implementation costs, dis-
counting, and the linkages between adaptation and mitigation.
The conventional cost-effectiveness and the cost-benefit tools
used for making decisions to reduce GHGs, or to select adap-
tation measures, provide only part of the information required
by the decision maker. The extensions that are currently being
discussed, and used in some cases, include the valuation of
external effects, and considerations of equity and sustainabili-
ty. The outline of the extended decision-making framework
and its relationship to the cost methodology is discussed in
Sections 7.2.1 to 7.2.5.

assessments of the modelling results for mitigation costs. A
taxonomy of the mitigation cost components applied in the
models was presented, including the direct engineering and
financial costs of specific technical measures, economic costs
for a given sector, macroeconomic costs, and welfare costs.
The importance of different assumptions, such as development
patterns, technological change, and policy instruments, were
then assessed in relation to cost concepts and modelling
approaches. Some of the focal areas considered were “top-
down” versus “bottom-up” models, double dividend issues and
no regret options, long-term projections, and special issues
related to mitigation-cost analysis for developing countries.

"After SAR, extensive debates arose regarding suitable costing
methods to quantify the relative indirect economic impacts of
various policies in distinct regions, with no consensus on the
most suitable methods to be employed. However, a consensus
is now beginning to emerge on how to quantify some ancillary
benefits (OECD, 2000), and Chapters 8 and 9 herein. In prepa-
ration for TAR, Burtraw et al. (1999) provide a synthesis of
methodological issues relevant to the assessment of ancillary
costs and benefits of GHG mitigation policies. The magnitude
of potential ancillary benefits depends upon the regulatory,
demographic, technological, and environmental baselines. The
magnitude and scope of potential benefits of GHG mitigation
policies can be expected to be greater in cases in which higher
emission baselines obtain and lower for cases in which regula-
tory and technological innovation have been more long stand-
ing (Morgenstern, 2000).

"During the TAR process, a crosscutting issues paper was pre-
pared (Markandya and Halsnaes, 2000). The purpose was to
provide a non-technical guide to the application of cost con-
cepts in the analysis of climate change policies by any of the
working groups involved in the TAR. Costs of mitigation, adap-
tation, or GHG emissions are likely to be estimated and their
implications discussed in many parts of the TAR. It is essential,
therefore, that a common understanding of the use of different
cost concepts is employed. The crosscutting paper proposed a
set of definitions for these concepts. The paper also identified
categories of costs and their relevance in the climate change
area. In this chapter the crosscutting issues paper is taken as the
point of departure, the ideas are developed further and an elab-
oration of some of them provided. The purpose, however, is the
same: to ensure a common understanding of commonly used
cost terms, and the role of cost analysis within the broader deci-
sion-making framework for climate change policies.

affected do not have well-defined markets and hence lack iden-
tifiable demand and supply schedules. Examples are changes
in air quality, or changes in recreational use of forests. In such
cases other methods of measuring WTP and WTA are required.

"The conceptual foundation of all cost estimation is the value of
the scarce resources to individuals. Thus, values are based on
individual preferences, and the total value of any resource is
the sum of the values of the different individuals involved in
the use of the resource. This distinguishes this system of values
from one based on “expert” preferences, or on the preferences
of political leaders. It also distinguishes it from value systems
based on ecological criteria, which give certain ecological
goals a value in themselves, independent of what individuals
might want, now or in the future.
"	Text
"The values, which are the foundation of the estimation of costs,
are measured by the applied welfare economic concepts of the
willingness to pay (WTP) of individuals to buy the resource, or
by the individuals’ willingness to accept (WTA) compensation
to part with the resource. The WTP measure of value reflects
the maximum people are willing to pay to live in a world with
climate policy in force rather than not. WTA is the minimum
compensation people would accept to live without this climate
policy (e.g., Willig, 1976; Randall and Stoll, 1980; Hanemann,
1991; Shogren et al., 1994). The concepts of WTP and WTA
therefore play a critical part in defining the social cost method.
"	Text
"A frequent criticism of this costing method is that it is
inequitable, as it gives greater weight to the “well off”. This is
because, typically, a well-off person has a greater WTP or
WTA than a less well-off person and hence the choices made
reflect more the preferences of the better off. This criticism is
valid, but there is no coherent and consistent method of valua-
tion that can replace the existing one in its entirety. Concerns
about, for example, equity can be addressed along with the
basic cost estimation. The estimated costs are one piece of
information in the decision-making process for climate change
that can be supplemented with other information on other
social objectives, for example impacts on key stakeholders and
the meeting of poverty objectives.
"	Text
"There is also a relationship between WTP and WTA and the
conventional aggregate measures of economic activity such as
gross domestic product (GDP). The classic paper on this is
Weitzman (1976), which showed that GDP less depreciation of
capital (or “net national product”) is a measure of the net out-
put that represents the income on the economy’s capital stock
when that economy is operating according to competitive mar-
ket rules. However, a competitive economy is also one that
maximizes the sum of consumer and producer surpluses.
Hence GDP is closely linked to consumer and producer surplus
maximization for commodities that operate through the market
place. However, the relationship breaks down if competitive
markets do not exist for all scarce resources. In this case, GDP
changes do not fully reflect changes in social welfare.

"Actions taken to abate GHG emissions or to increase the size
of carbon sinks generally divert resources from other alterna-
tive uses. The theoretically precise measure of the social costs
of climate protection, therefore, is the total value that society
places on the goods and services forgone as a result of the
diversion of resources to climate protection. A social cost
assessment should ideally consider all welfare changes that
result from the changes in resources demanded and supplied by
a given mitigation project or strategy in relation to a specific
non-policy case (see Hazilla and Kopp, 1990). The assessment
should include, as far as possible, all resource components and
implementation costs. This means that both the benefits and the
costs of a mitigation action should be included in the estima-
tion. In some cases, the sum of all the benefits and costs asso-
ciated with a mitigation action could be negative, meaning that
society benefits from undertaking the mitigation action.

The basic idea of multi-attribute analysis is to define a frame-
work for integrating different decision parameters and values in
a quantitative analysis without assigning monetary values to all
parameters. Examples of parameters that can be controversial
and very difficult to measure in monetary values are human
health impacts, equity, and irreversible environmental damages

This measures all negative and positive project impacts and
resource uses in the form of monetary costs and benefits. Market
prices are used as the basic valuation, as long as markets can be
assumed to reflect “real” resource scarcities. In other cases the
prices are adjusted to reflect the true resource costs of the action.
Such adjusted prices are referred to as shadow prices (Squire and

The policy goal can, for example, be a specified goal of emis-

"The underlying objective behind any cost assessment is to
measure the change in human welfare generated as the result of
a reallocation or change in use of resources. This implies the
existence of a function in which welfare or “utility” depends on
various factors such as the amounts of goods and services that
the individual can access, different aspects of the individual’s
physical and spiritual environment, and his or her rights and
liberties. Constructing a “utility function”, representing social
welfare, that is an aggregate measure of all such impacts for all
individuals involves a number of complexities and controver-
sial equity issues that have been intensively studied by econo-
mists (see, for example, Blackorby and Donaldson, 1988).
However, the sum of the individual WTPs and WTAs can be
taken as a measure of the social welfare, which finesses these
difficulties to a considerable extent. There remain, however,
issues that cannot be fully addressed in this WTP—WTA frame-
work, most important of which are equity and sustainability.
"	Text
"A key question in broadening the analysis of costs to cover
these dimensions is whether they can be measured in the same
units as the costs (i.e., in money). The authors take the view
that the methods to “convert” some of these other dimensions
into monetary terms are useful and should be pursued. These
are discussed further in Section 7.2.3. At the same time, there
is some controversy about the measurement of equity, of envi-
ronmental impacts and sustainability in monetary terms, as, for
example, in the discussion on social cost-benefit analysis in
Ray (1984).? This is because of disagreement about what val-
ues should be attached to physical and social changes that are
of interest. Furthermore, it is generally accepted that not all
these impacts can be put in monetary terms.’ Hence it is impor-
tant, indeed imperative, that the cost methodology be supple-
mented by a broader assessment of the impacts with physical
values reported wherever possible. These questions are dis-
cussed further in Sections 7.3 and 7.4.

"The literature uses a number of terms to depict the associated
benefits and costs that arise in conjunction with GHG mitiga-
tion policies. These include co-benefits, ancillary benefits, side
benefits, secondary benefits, collateral benefits, and associated
benefits. In the current discussion, the term “‘co-benefits” refers
to the non-climate benefits of GHG mitigation policies that are
explicitly incorporated into the initial creation of mitigation
policies. Thus, the term co-benefits reflects that most policies
designed to address GHG mitigation also have other, often at
least equally important, rationales involved at the inception of
these policies (e.g., related to objectives of development, sus-
tainability, and equity). In contrast, the term ancillary benefits
connotes those secondary or side effects of climate change mit-
igation policies on problems that arise subsequent to any pro-
posed GHG mitigation policies. These include reductions in
local and regional air pollution associated with the reduction of
fossil fuels, and indirect effects on issues such as transporta-
tion, agriculture, land use practices, employment, and fuel
security. Sometimes these benefits are referred to as “ancillary
impacts”, to reflect that in some cases the benefits may be neg-
ative. From the perspective of policies to abate local air pollu-
tion, GHG mitigation may be an ancillary benefit.

"External costs typically arise when markets fail to provide a
link between the person who creates the “externality” and the
person who is affected by it, or more generally when property
rights for the relevant resources are not well defined. If such
rights were defined, market forces and/or bargaining arrange-
ments would ensure that the benefits and costs of generating
the external effect balanced properly. The failure to take into
account external costs, however, may be a product not only of
a lack of property rights, but also the result of a lack of full
information and non-zero transaction costs.

"The private cost component is generally taken from the market
prices of the inputs. Thus, if a project involves an investment
of US$5 million, as estimated by the inputs of land, materials,
labour and equipment, that figure is used as the private cost.
That may not be the full cost, however, as far as the estimation
of social cost is concerned. If, for example, the labour input is
being paid more than its value in alternative employment, the
private cost is higher than the social cost. Adjustments to pri-
vate costs based on market prices to bring them into line with
social costs are referred to as shadow pricing. A fuller discus-
sion of shadow pricing is given in Ray (1984).

of charge revenue). As a third example, consider the case in
which the regulator has a plan to tighten the controls on local
pollutants. Any GHG mitigation programme that reduces the
levels of these emissions has then to be valued relative to the
costs of achieving the dynamic baseline, and not in terms of the
benefits of reduced emissions themselves. To sum up, the val-
uation of ancillary and/or co-benefits requires the policymaker
to look not only at the external costs of the pollutants, but also
at the net costs and benefits of measures being introduced to
deal with them.

phur. If a GHG mitigation programme is introduced it may
reduce the associated amount of sulphur produced, but other
activities may take up the slack and so result in no net change
in emissions. Alternatively, consider the situation in which the

"Policies aimed at mitigating GHGs, as stated earlier, can yield
other social benefits and costs (here called ancillary benefits
and costs), and a number of empirical studies have made a pre-
liminary attempt to assess these impacts. It is apparent that the
actual magnitude of the ancillary benefits or co-benefits
assessed critically depends on the scenario structure of the
analysis, in particular on the assumptions about policy man-
agement in the baseline case (IPCC, 2000b; Krupnick ef al.,
1996; Krupnick ef al., 2000).° This implies that whether a par-
ticular impact is included or not depends on the primary objec-
tive of the programme. Moreover, something that is seen as a
GHG reduction programme from an international perspective
may be seen, from a national perspective, as one in which local
pollutants and GHGs are equally important.

ognized, or “internal”, contained in the price of goods and ser-
vices. Consider a stylized example, such as damages to vehi-
cles in an automobile accident. If each driver is fully liable for
damages to other vehicles and one can reliably assess fault and
enforce liability, the damage in an accident would not be an
externality because the party at fault would fully recognize the
costs. Only if the drivers are not fully liable, or if fault cannot
be established, or if liability is not enforceable is there a justi-
fication for treating the damage to vehicles in the example as
an externality. The key idea is that such exceptions constitute a
deviation from ideal institutions. In economic vocabulary, this
is referred to as market failure. For damage to be considered an
externality from the viewpoint of economic efficiency, some
kind of failure in markets or other institutions that causes indi-
viduals to fail to take into account the social costs and benefits
of their individual actions should be identifiable. From a prac-
tical perspective, it is also important that such failures result in
an important misallocation of resources.

"At the same time, there may be ancillary costs of GHG mitiga-
tion, such as an increase in indoor air pollution associated with
a switch from electricity to household energy sources (such as
wood or lignite) or greater reliance on nuclear power with its
attendant externalities. In developing countries pollution may
rise if electrification slows as a result of policy-induced
increases in electricity prices relative to other fuels
(Markandya, 1994). A related cost stems from forgoing the
benefits of electrification, which include increased productive
efficiency and emergence of new technologies, to increases in
literacy (Schurr, 1984). Table 7.1 offers an illustrative set of
examples of ancillary benefits (+) and costs (—). Under certain
conditions, some of these observed impacts do not necessarily
count as externalities from the standpoint of economic effi-
ciency, depending on whether the market or institutions fail to
account for these impacts in the incentives they provide for
individual behaviour.

"Impact pathway analysis measures the losses of goods and ser-
vices affected by environmental impacts which are themselves
(or their substitutes) priced in the market. To identify these
losses, the effects of an action are traced from the release of
pollutants and their dispersion in the ambient environment
through to their impacts on natural resources and on humans.
Based on the changes of market prices of these goods and ser-
vices caused by the environmental impacts, demand schedules
and the respective consumer surplus, measures can be estimat-
ed to reflect the welfare losses. This method has been used
extensively to value the impacts of air pollution generated by
electricity generation and transport (ExternE, 1995; 1997;
1999). Its main limitations are (a) the physical data on the link-
ages are not always quantified and those that are can be highly
uncertain, (b) market prices are not available for all impacts,
and (c) the more sophisticated analysis of price changes
requires a level of modelling that is not always possible.

estimate of how much people are willing to pay for changes in
environmental quality. This measure represents a use value for

effects such as noise, air quality, and visibility. The main limi-

to be well informed about the impacts and markets, so that
decisions about location can be made freely and easily. For

"Nevertheless, although such methods of valuation have prob-
lems, there is often no suitable alternative and they provide
policymakers with important information for decision-making
purposes. As suggested above, both physical impacts and val-
ues should be used in this process. In relation to climate
change, the estimation of external effects arises primarily in the
assessment of damages that result from such change, including
those in agriculture, forests, energy use, recreation, and health.
In relation to mitigation, the applications are primarily in valu-
ing the impacts of O,, NO,, SO,, particulate matter, and sec-
ondary particles. In adaptation, the valuation of external effects
arises with respect to loss of land, changes to recreational facil-
ities, and changes to agriculture.

"By asking people directly how much they are willing to pay for
a change in a provision of benefits from an environmental
resource, a hypothetical market can be created in which a
demand curve for ecological goods and services can be esti-

can be estimated, since hypothetical markets can be created for
them. Since it is not based on revealed preferences, on which
the other demand approaches are based, contingent valuation
may incur in various biases, from strategic answers to lack of
information. Such biases are currently well documented and
techniques have been developed to reduce them. Contingent

Routine operations generate externalities through mining accidents, transport accidents, power-generation accidents, construction and dismantling accidents,

Water pollution effects include impacts of mining (including solid wastes) on ground and surface water, power-plant emissions to water bodies, and acid depo-

"Whether an implementation policy is “marginal” or “general”
depends on the general market conditions, as well as on the
whole design of policy instruments targeted towards climate
change mitigation. Given a “general” environment in which
energy and financial markets are efficient, competitive, and
have little government intervention, and in which the institu-
tional context is perceived as favourable for climate change
mitigation programmes, the implementation policies need only
take the form of information programmes, energy auditing, and
other specific regulation efforts. However, if energy prices are
heavily subsidized and financial markets are very limited, the
implementation policy may require general price reforms, spe-

"All climate change policies necessitate some costs of imple-

costs are not fully covered in conventional cost analyses.
Implementation costs in this context are meant to reflect the
more permanent institutional aspects of putting a programme
into place and are different to those costs conventionally con-
sidered as transaction costs. The latter, by definition, are tem-
porary transition costs. Considerable work needs to be done to
quantify the institutional and other costs of programmes, so
that the reported figures are a better representation of the true
costs that will be incurred if the programmes considered in

"Consider the transfer of health risk estimates. For instance, an
estimate of WTP for a given risk reduction from contaminated
water in Wyoming could be transferred to a reduced risk of
poor water quality in Mongolia, as long as the transfer proto-
col is satisfied. This protocol can be rather strict, however. For
a health risk, the researcher must first specify the commodity.
This includes defining the response (death or illness) and
causal agent (e.g., chemical), as well as understanding the
probability and severity of the risk and risk reduction methods,
the temporal dimensions of the risk, whether the risk is volun-
tary or involuntary, and the exposure pathways and exposure
levels. Once the risk is defined, the sample and site character-
istics have to be classified, including socioeconomic and loca-
tion particulars. Finally, the protocol has to address the market
and exchange mechanisms that define the frame of how risk is
reduced. Three elements are likely to matter—the set of risk
reduction mechanisms (e.g., mitigation and adaptation
options), the measure of value (e.g., WTP or WTA), and the

"Any “realistic” discount rate used to discount the impacts of
increased climate change impacts would render the damages,
which occur over long periods of time, very small. With a hori-
zon of around 200 years, a discount rate of 4% implies that
damages of US$1 at the end the period are valued at 0.04 cents
today. At 8% the same damages are worth 0.00002 cents today.
Hence, at discount rates in this range the damages associated
with climate change become very small and even disappear
(Cline, 1993).

"The debate on discount rates is a long-standing one. As SAR
notes (IPCC, 1996a, Chapter 4), there are two approaches to
discounting; an ethical, or prescriptive, approach based on
what rates of discount should be applied, and a descriptive
approach based on what rates of discount people (savers as
well as investors) actually apply in their day-to-day decisions.
SAR notes that the former lead to relatively low rates of dis-
count (around 2%-—33% in real terms) and the latter to relative-
ly higher rates (at least 6% and, in some cases, very much high-
er rates).

"To a limited extent, such feedbacks can be integrated into a
project- or sector-level mitigation-cost assessment by the use
of shadow prices. These shadow prices reflect underlying
social valuations of the use of different goods and services by
different agents. By estimating them in a suitable manner some
of the implementation costs, such as changes in government
income or expenditure, or the higher value of foreign
exchange, can be captured in the cost analysis. Importantly,
however, implementation costs assessed using shadow prices
do not pick up factors such as quantitative or physical con-

will yield carbon benefits well into the future. Most estimates
of the cost of reductions in GHGs do not, however apply a dis-
count rate to the carbon changes. Instead, they simply take the

"For mitigation effects, the country must base its decisions at

ably justified. Rates of this level are in fact used for the
appraisal of public sector projects in the European Union (EU)
(Watts, 1999). In developing countries the rate could be as high
as 10%-12%. The international banks use these rates, for
example, in appraising investment projects in developing
countries. It is more of a challenge, therefore, to argue that cli-
mate change mitigation projects should face different rates,
unless the mitigation project is of very long duration. These
rates do not reflect private rates of return, which typically need
to be considerably higher to justify the project, potentially

general changes in market prices and tax systems can only be
assessed at the economy-wide level. The introduction of ener-

"While most people appreciate that actions on adaptation affect
the costs of mitigation, this obvious point is often not

mitigation being seen as addressing climate change and adap-

sequence, the estimated costs of each can be biased (see Kane
and Shogren, 2000). Usually, mitigation and adaptation are
modelled separately as a necessary simplification to gain trac-
tion on an immense and complex issue. One question that must
be addressed is “How reasonable is this assumption?” Another
is “What are the likely consequences of this assumption on the
estimated costs of mitigation?”

"Climate change puts society at risk. It is possible to prevent

occur. Adaptation strategies to climate risk include the chang-
ing of production and consumption decisions to reduce the
severity of a worse state in the scenario if it does occur (Ehrlich
and Becker, 1972; Crocker and Shogren, 1999). A portfolio of
mitigation and adaptation actions jointly determines climate
risks and the costs of reducing them. Since individuals in their
private capacity have the liberty to undertake adaptation to cli-
mate change on their own accord, modellers and policymakers
need to address these adaptive responses when choosing the
optimal degree of public mitigation. If this is not the case, then
policy actions are likely to be more expensive than they need
be, with no additional reduction in climate risk (see, e.g.,
Schelling, 1992).

"Hyperbolic discounting implies that a person’s relative evalua-
tion of two payments depends on both the delay between the
two payments and when this delay will occur—sooner or later.
For instance, people often have an impulsive preference for
immediate reward. Some people prefer to receive US$1000
today over US$1010 in a month’s time, and yet they also pre-
fer US$1010 in 21 months to US$1000 in 20 months, even
though both choices involve a month’s wait to obtain $10 more
(see Lowenstein and Prelec, 1992). Theoretical support for
hyperbolic discount rests on the idea that, while interest rates
from financial instruments can be used to identify appropriate
discount rates for time horizons of a few decades, they do not
apply to future interest rates for far distant horizons. These will
be determined by future opportunity sets created by many fac-
tors, such as economic growth. The fact that the scope of these
future opportunity sets for the far distant future is not known
adds another layer of uncertainty into climate policy, which
tends to drive discount rates down.

"More recent analysis on discounting now examines rates that
vary with the time period considered. In surveys of individual
trade-offs over time, Cropper et al. (1994) estimated a nominal
rate of around 16.8%, based on a sophisticated questionnaire
approach to valuing present versus future risks. Most impor-
tantly, however, these authors found evidence that respondents
do not discount future lives saved at a constant exponential rate
of discount. Rather, median rates seem to be decline over time
(i.e., a rate is not constant over time but decreases as the time
horizon lengthens). Using different econometric specifications
that allow the discount rate to decline over time, Cropper et al.
(1994) estimate that mean discount rates are greater for short
time periods relative to long time horizons. For example, fit-
ting their data to a hyperbolic function suggests that mean dis-
count rate is 0.80 for 1 year and 0.08 for 100 years. While the
pattern is consistent, the implied rates using linear discount rate
functions are much larger: 34% for the initial period and about
12% for the last period.

reasonable way the linkages between these sets of actions, and
to establish how this interaction can impact the estimated costs
of climate protection. Even if a complete empirical application
of the portfolio of risk avoidance is currently unreachable, an
understanding of which unmeasured links might be most valu-
able to decision makers in the future could indicate whether the

"Third, uncertainty in cost is affected by interaction of the tech-
nologies for risk reduction—mitigation and adaptation. By miti-
gation, humans reduce the odds that a deleterious event hap-
pens; by adaptation, they reduce the consequences when a dam-
aging event actually does occur. For the most part, climate
change literature contains models that deal with mitigation and
adaptation separately. This is unfortunate, since significant
interactions are likely to exist between how people choose to
mitigate and adapt (Shogren and Crocker, 1999). These risk-
reduction strategies probably complement or negate each other.
Understanding the interaction between the two can help formu-
late better the analysis of mitigation costs. The benefits of mit-
igation will be lower if more people can adapt to the climate.

"Similar to income and substitution effects, adaptation can have
two effects on the costs of mitigation. First, more adaptation can
lower mitigation costs because policymakers choose to move to
another point on the same mitigation cost curve - adaptation
does not alter the marginal productivity of mitigation, it induces
a shift along the cost curbe. Second, adaptation acting as a tech-
nical substitute or complement shifts the mitigation cost curve.
For example, flood defences change land use and thereby
change costs and prices in an area, which impacts on mitigation
costs. Whether adaptation causes a shift along the mitigation
cost curve or a shift of the entire curve itself, or both, then
becomes a modelling question, and an empirical one to deter-
mine the magnitude of the shift along and to a new cost curve.

"Second, sectoral work in agriculture, forestry, and coastal areas
shows that cost estimates are sensitive to the inclusion of adap-

ence how adaptation affects mitigation in agriculture.
Increased levels of risk directly induce a nation to adapt more
by switching its crop mix and crop varieties to those more tol-
erant of drier or wetter conditions, and by modifying its weed
control strategies. The magnitude of this adaptation depends on
how risk affects the perceived marginal productivity of mitiga-
tion (e.g., more or less effective soil sequestration per unit of
area), and how mitigation and adaptation work with or against
each other. Bouzaher ef al. (1995), for example, estimate that
winter cover crops can be used to increase soil organic carbon
by expanding annual biomass production. They also show that
conservation tillage, the Conservation Reserve Program, and
the Wetlands Reserve Program can increase soil carbon by
minimizing soil disturbance and targetting bottomland for
hardwood trees. For non-climate risk, models that account for

"First, separability presupposes that the overall effectiveness
and costs of mitigation do not depend on adaptation. However,
for this assumption to hold, the implicit presumption is that cli-
mate risk is exogenous—a risk beyond people’s private or col-
lective ability to reduce. The necessary economic conditions
for this to hold are rather restrictive. In particular, climate risk
can be considered as exogenous only if markets are complete.
A complete set of markets exists if people can contract to
insure against all risks from each conceivable state of nature
that might be realized (Marshall, 1976). Complete markets
allow for perfect risk spreading and risk pooling such that the
only remaining risk is outside the control of human actions
(e.g., phases of the moon). However, markets for climate risk
are notorious incomplete or non-existent because of the high
cost of contracting (Chichilnisky and Heal, 1993). People
make private and collective adaptation decisions through the
markets that do exist and through collective policy actions. The
economic circumstances that influence these choices matter to
the level of risk, and addressing these conditions is essential for
the successful estimation of costs. People choose to create and
reduce risk. How people perceive risk, the relative costs and
benefits of alternative risk reduction strategies, and relative
wealth affect these choices.

to the high utilization of pollution-intensive domestic fuels. In

successful economic policies generate increased growth and

which they are produced. Economic policies in some cases can
imply a more efficient use of resources, which means that the
GHG emission intensity per unit of economic output decreas-

be measured as the difference between the GHG emissions in
the baseline case and the GHG emissions after the implemen-

baseline and the options chosen for the mitigation. High base-
line-scenario GHG emissions based on a business-as-usual sce-

costs measured per unit of GHG emission reduction are rela-
tively low. Such a result, for example, can reflect that the mit-
igation scenario is assumed to imply a general efficiency
improvement of the energy systems compared with the base-
line wich both reduces GHG emission and generates fuel cost
savings. The total costs of achieving a given GHG emission
level (e.g., defined in relation to 1990 emissions), however, can
be relatively high when the mitigation strategy is assessed in
relation to a business-as-usual baseline scenario that has a large
growth in GHG emissions. Conversely, GHG emission reduc-

it can be difficult to design the project such that it creates both

policies can have on the functioning of labour and capital mar-

the prices of output, and thus reduce the real return to labour

labour or capital tax rates have to be raised, exacerbating prior

effectiveness of climate change mitigation projects. A baseline
scenario approach that uses internationally standardized tech-

a relatively low GHG emission intensity from their power sys-

relatively strong “market position” in this case, because the
GHG emission reductions achieved with the particular CDM or

countries with a relatively high GHG emission intensity com-
pared with the international standard will tend to have a weak-
er market position than in the alternative approach, in which

relative to labour). This in itself calls for a tax reform the benefits of
which should not be ascribed to the introduction of a revenue-gener-

other pollution, but another option, like the introduction of

emissions but increases NO, emissions and thereby local air
pollution. The gross and net costs assessed for these pro-
grammes depend on specific baseline and policy case scenar-

policies are critical).

"It is important that assumptions about environmental control
policies outside the specific area of GHG emissions reduction
be carefully specified in relation to the baseline as well as to
the policy case. If the baseline assumes that some environmen-

ered, the side effects of the GHG reduction policy in relation to
these areas cover part of these environmental policy objectives.
The mitigation costs then eventually offset part of the control
cost in the baseline case. However, if the baseline case includes
specific flue-gas cleaning systems on power plants to control
SO, and NO, emissions that are already installed, then invest-
ments in these plants are irreversible. In this case, the joint ben-
efit of climate change mitigation programmes in the form of
avoided control cost on the other emissions is low, while the
public health ancillary benefits may be substantial (see also the
discussion on ancillary and/or co-benefits in Section 7.2.2).

"For policies that raise revenue for the government (carbon
taxes and auctioned permits), this is only part of the story, how-
ever. These revenues can be recycled to reduce existing distor-
tionary taxes. Thus, to attain a given GHG emissions target,
revenue-generating policy instruments have the advantage of a
potential cost-reducing “revenue-recycling effect”, as com-
pared to the alternative, non-auctioned tradable permits or
other instruments that do not generate revenue (Bohm, 1998).
Ina simple, stylized representation of the economy, Bovenberg
et al. (1994) and Goulder (1995a, b) suggest that in only a few
cases is the tax interaction effect fully offset by the revenue-
recycling effect. In theoretical, numerical analyses, the “inter-
action effect” is found to be larger than the “revenue-recycling
effect” (Parry et al., 1999), which means that the introduction
of an environmental policy, regardless of the policy instru-
ment(s) used, has a net cost to the economy. !? It is also true,
however, that under some circumstances the (cost-reducing)
“revenue-recycling effect” might exceed the (cost-increasing)
“interaction effect”. This could happen if, for example, the
interaction effect was small, for example because of a suffi-
ciently inelastic labour supply, or if some highly distortionary
pre-existing taxes could be lowered.!!

an integrated treatment of all three issues is, inter alia, a con-
sequence of the different approaches to the technology charac-
terisation in top-down models (macroeconomic) and bottom-
up models (technology- or policy-specific models), which are
further explained and discussed in Section 7.6. A few studies
exist, however, that attempt such an integration (see, e.g.,
Walz, 1999).

"The different viewpoints on the origin of technological change
appear in the assumed rate at which the energy-consuming capi-
tal can turnover without a change in relative energy prices.
Modellers account for the penetration of technological change
over time through a technical coefficient called the “autonomous
energy efficiency improvement” (AEEI). The AEEI reflects the
rate of change in energy intensity (the energy-to-GDP ratio)
holding energy prices constant (see IPCC, 1996a, Chapter 8).
The presumed autonomous technological improvement in the
energy intensity of an economy can lead to significant differ-
ences in the estimated costs of mitigation. As such, many
observers view the choice of AEE] as crucial in setting the base-
line scenario against which to judge the costs of mitigation. The
costs of mitigation are inversely related the AEEI- the greater the
AEEI the lower the costs to reach any given climate target. The
costs decrease because people adopt low-carbon technology of
their own accord, with no change in relative prices.
"	Text
"Modellers have traditionally based the AEEI on historical rates
of change, but now some are using higher values based on data
from bottoms-up models and arguments about “announcement
effects”. For instance, some analysts have optimistically argued
that the existence of the Kyoto Protocol will accelerate the
implementation of energy efficient production methods to 2%
per year or more. Policymakers and modellers continue to
debate the validity of this assumption (see, e.g., Kram, 1998;
Weyant, 1998). A range of AEEIs has been adopted in the mod-
elling literature (see Chapter 8 for more details). The AEEI has
ranged from 0.4% to 1.5% per year for all of the regions of the
world, and has generated large differences in long-term project
baselines (e.g., Manne and Richels, 1992). Edmonds and Barns’
(1990) sensitivity study confirms the importance of the AEEI in
affecting cost estimates. However, as noted by Dean and
Hoeller (1992): “unfortunately there is relatively little backing
in the economic literature for specific values of the AEE ... the
inability to tie it down to a much narrower range ... is a severe
handicap, an uncertainty which needs to be recognized.”

it is also affected by personal and social preferences that influ-

Q associated with reductions in GHG emissions level E. If the
economy is at a level below F then it is possible to increase the
total production of Q and/or E. If O is taken as the starting point
of the economy in Figure 7.3 then all movements in the “trian-

"In estimating the costs, the crucial question is where the
baseline scenario is located with respect to the efficient pro-
duction frontier of the economy F. If the chosen baseline
scenario assumes that the economy is located on the frontier,
as in the efficient baseline case, there is a direct trade-off
between economic activity and emissions reduction.
Increased emissions reduction moves the economy along the
frontier to the right. Economic activity is reduced and the
costs of mitigation increase. If the economy is below the
frontier, at a point such as O, there is a potential for combined
GHG emissions reduction policies and improvements of the
efficiency of resource use, implying a number of benefits
associated with the policy.

external impacts of the options. External costs arise when mar-

rights for the relevant resources are not well defined. External
costs can relate to environmental side-impacts, and distortions
in markets for labour, land, energy resources, and various
other areas. By convention, the benefits in an assessment of
GHG emissions reduction costs do not include the impacts
associated with avoided climate change damages. A broader
definition could include the idea that a no regrets policy
would, in hindsight, not preclude (e.g., by introducing lock-in
effects or irreversibilities) even more beneficial outcomes, but
this is not taken up in the mitigation literature. The no regret

what regulatory framework is adopted by national govern-
ments to reduce GHGs. In general, the more flexibility the
framework allows, the lower the costs of achieving a given
reduction. A stringent, inflexible carbon-mitigation policy
induces greater economic burden than a loose, flexible policy.
More flexibility and more trading partners can reduce costs.
The opposite is expected with inflexible rules and few trading
partners.

"The details as to how flexibility is achieved matter. Many
advocates prefer emissions trading over carbon taxes because
the quantity of carbon flowing into the atmosphere is fixed,
thereby shifting risk from the environment to the economy in
the form of price uncertainty. However, some suggestions on
the design of emissions trading create relatively high transac-
tion costs that would limit the cost savings of a trading system.
Furthermore, the key issue of how the emissions rights should
be allocated has yet to be resolved (IPCC, 1996a; Jepma and
Munasinghe, 1998).

"The costs that actually face private agents are different from
the social costs, and therefore the market potential (as defined
in Chapter 5) may be very different from the potential based on
social costs. This implies that the actual implementation of no
regrets options requires that it be possible to introduce policies
that “narrow the gap” between the market potential and a
potential estimated on the basis of social costs. Cameron et al.
(1999) give a systematic overview of market failures and mar-
ket barriers important to the implementation of no regrets
options.
"	Text
"To sum up, flexibility in the regulatory framework can play a
major role in reducing the costs of GHG emissions reduction.
The extent to which particular instruments can be adopted,
however, depends on resolving serious political differences as
to how the burden of emissions reduction should be shared,
between developed countries themselves, and between both
developed and developing countries. It is important also not to
underestimate the costs of implementing changes in regulato-
ry policy (see Section 7.2.3), especially in developing coun-
tries. For some of the practical problems in using flexible
instruments in such countries, see Seroa da Motta et al.
(1999).
"	Text
"Another source of flexibility is to include carbon sinks in the
policy framework. Recall that a carbon sink is a process that
destroys or absorbs GHGs, such as the absorption of atmos-
pheric carbon dioxide by terrestrial (e.g., trees) and oceanic
biota. The main anthropogenic sink is tree planting and other
forest management actions. Soils and other types of vegetation
also provide a potential sink. It is estimated that forests around
the world contain roughly about 1,146GtC in their vegetation
and soil, with about twice as much in soil as in vegetation (See
IPCC, 2000c). For the USA, forests are an important terrestri-
al sink, given that they cover about 750 million acres (about
300 million hectares). Land use changes in the USA have
increased the uptake of carbon to an estimated 200MC,,.
"	Text
"A few studies found that carbon sequestration through sinks
could cost as little as US$25/tonne C in the USA for ISOMtC,,
(Stavins, 1999). But serious uncertainties remain about how to
measure and account for estimates of net carbon. For example,
how forest management activities affect soil carbon is
unknown, and since forest soils contain over 50% of the total
stored forest carbon in the USA, this difference can have a sig-
nificant impact on estimates. And some researchers have
shown that sinks are not as effective as predicted when the
interaction of forest reserves and the timber market is account-
ed for. The more land that is set aside for carbon sinks, the
quicker the cycle of harvesting on other forestland, and the less
total net carbon sequestration. Some fear that these ambiguities
about sinks could divert attention from first-order priorities to
second-order technicalities (Jacoby ef al., 1998).

"Returning to the implications for climate change mitigation
cost, it can be concluded that the no regrets issues reflect spe-
cific assumptions about the location of the economy in relation
to the efficient production frontier. Bottom-up studies have (in
most cases on the basis of a specific assessment of production
practices in main GHG emitting sectors, such as the energy
sector) assumed that the economy in the baseline case operates
below the optimal frontier and that mitigation policies imply an
increased efficiency of technologies. The costs of implement-
ing mitigation policies are then partly offset by direct and indi-
rect benefits, which sometimes are large enough to generate a
negative cost result. Top-down approaches, however, assume
that the economy is efficient in the baseline case and mitigation
policies therefore always imply a trade-off with other goods
and thereby have a positive cost.

"A thread that runs through much of the discussion of costs is
that of uncertainty. The whole exercise of estimating mitigation
costs is confounded by imprecise information about baselines,
and the costs of mitigation and adaptation measures (especial-

nized and conveyed to the policymakers in the most effective
manner possible.

"In the crosscutting paper on uncertainty (Moss and Schneider,
2000), a number of scales are proposed to assess the level of
imprecision in the reported impacts, costs, etc. One that has
frequently been used for costing exercises is the three-point
scale that seeks to evaluate the degree of confidence in a par-
ticular result using a scale of: low, medium, and high confi-
dence levels. This has been expanded to a five-point scale,
which asks the researcher to select one of the following:

"Technological uncertainty is another key area. As noted in
Section 7.3.4.1, the autonomous rate of improvement in the
energy-to-GDP ratio that underlies almost all models of cli-
mate economics is a clear example of an exogenous parameter
currently subject to uncertainty. This is not easy to overcome
by endogenizing technical change, as practical models current-
ly available have difficulties in dealing with endogenous tech-
nical change. Thus, the way firms develop new technologies is
probably an issue surrounded by a greater uncertainty than
uncertainty on the consumer side. There is a moderate degree
of consensus in the literature on these issues. As with baselines,
a scenario approach is essential and results have to be reported
for both “optimistic” and “pessimistic” development paths.
"	Text
"Finally there are uncertainties in the estimated costs as well as
in the estimation of the ancillary benefits and/or co-benefits. As
the literature on potential ancillary benefits is continues to
develop, current estimates of the net social impacts of various
mitigation policies are necessarily incomplete. Private cost fig-
ures are generally more certain than the external ones, but
some imprecision remains. As with baselines, a scenario
approach is recommended, with estimates prepared for a “low
value”, a “mid value”, and a “high value”. Uncertainty about
the external costs is well recognized. As with the private costs,
again a scenario approach that gives a range from low, through
mid, to high values is recommended. In both cases the scenario
approach provides a sensitivity analysis for the costing exer-
cise.
"	Text
"Taking a different approach, the way consumers adopt existing
lower carbon technologies and firms develop new ones can be
viewed as key sources of uncertainty in costing methodologies.
These assumptions are crucial, as different valuations are like-
ly to affect the conclusions. However, the ways in which guid-
ance and information about these two crucial issues are pro-
vided are radically different. Two different options are avail-
able from the consumer side. First, energy oriented macro-
econometric models can provide a price elasticity to show how
changes in the fuel mix are driven by relative prices. No spe-
cific direction of technological change can be derived from this
class of model. However, differences in the results in terms of
different energy structures (and different carbon impacts) could
easily emerge. Second, engineering studies can provide some
indications about available lower energy technologies to show
the impact on energy demand and carbon emissions. Hence,
from the point of view of uncertainty there is no a priori rea-
son to choose between bottom-up and top-down models.

goal of such an assessment is to inform decision makers about
how different policy objectives can be met efficiently, given

"It must be recognized that the full set of adjustments to GDP
measures needed to obtain a correct welfare measure of the
costs is difficult to compute. If the policies have ancillary ben-

are less than any fall in GDP. This adjustment can be made
(using the methods discussed in Section 7.2.3) to the GDP
measure if the data on the ancillary benefits are collected.
Other adjustments relate to changes in distributional effects
and the shadow pricing of goods and services for which prices
do not reflect social costs. Without a detailed microlevel analy-
sis of which sectors are affected, however, these corrections are
not possible. Hence it has to be recognized that GDP changes
are less accurate as measures of the true costs of mitigation

programmes.

role in the analysis. As noted in Section 7.2.2, under certain cir-
cumstances GDP is a valid welfare measure of the value of the
goods and services produced in an economy. In so far as this is
the case, changes in GDP in real terms (i.e., adjusting for price
changes) are also a valid measure of the costs of any mitigation
policy. The major qualification is that prices should reflect
social costs and that all activities that affect welfare should be
included. To the extent that this is not the case a change in GDP
is not an accurate measure of the costs of a programme. One
common reason for divergence between GDP and welfare is
the presence of external effects. Another is the failure to
account for the economic value of leisure or household work.

fits depend primarily on the period that a person is employed,
what state support is offered during any period of unemploy-
ment, and what opportunities there are for informal activities
that generate income in cash or kind. In addition, unemploy-

funds, that is the cost per dollar of finance, which is greater by

"Before considering the framework for such an evaluation, it is
important to set out the theoretical reasons for arguing that
unemployment reduction has a social value. In neoclassic eco-
nomic analysis, no social cost is normally associated with
unemployment. The presumption is that the economy is effec-
tively fully employed, and that any measured unemployment
results from matching the changing demand for labour to a
changing supply. In a well-functioning and stable market, indi-
viduals can anticipate periods when they will be out of work,
as they leave one job and move to another. Consequently, the
terms of labour employment contracts, as well as the terms of
unemployment insurance, reflect the presence of such periods,
and there is no cost to society from the existence of a pool of
such unemployed workers. However, these conditions are far
from the reality in most of the developing and some of the
developed countries in which the GHG projects will be under-
taken. Many of those presently unemployed have poor
prospects of employment.

the estimation of which the World Bank (1991) and others have

"In a world in which countries are linked by international trade,

Spillovers are a broad concept that has been used in relation to
a number of different international inter-linkages between

"Price levels are always changing to reflect changes in the
relative scarcity of inputs and other factors. However, when
the overall cost of goods and services increases in a certain
period, then the economy faces inflation. Two aspects of infla-
tion need to be considered. First, for comparison at different
points in time an adjustment should be made for any general
increase in the price level, that is the comparisons should be
made in real terms. The appropriate deflator is a matter of
judgement, but it should be based on a basket of goods con-
sumed by the relevant group of consumers in the country.
Also, any such adjustments do not preclude the possibility of
increases in “real prices”. It is quite possible that the costs and
benefits attached to some impacts increase slower (or faster)
than the general price level.

"The above discussion assumes that the capital allocated to the
project is free to be used for any other project. What happens,
however, if capital is not “fungible” in this sense, but is made
available by a donor or third party for the specific purpose of
implementing climate change programmes? In these circum-
stances the assessment of the programme from the national
viewpoint differs from its assessment from the viewpoint of the
third party. The national assessment could take the shadow
price of capital as zero if it genuinely could not be used for any
other purpose. If, however, there were a number of alternative
projects to which the capital could be allocated, a comparison
between them should be based on a shadow price of capital that
reflects its scarcity relative to the investment opportunities
available. The party providing the finance, on the other hand,
will have its own set of alternative projects to which the capi-
tal could be allocated and it may apply its own shadow price.
The important point is that the evaluation and ranking of pro-
jects from a domestic viewpoint may differ from their ranking
from a donor perspective. When rankings differ, a compromise
is usually reached, based on the relative bargaining strengths of
the two parties.

how carbon taxes affect trade flows in the short and long runs.

increases in emissions abroad. The empirical question is
whether nations that are a net exporter in fossil fuel intensive
products (e.g., steel) gain under Annex I-only carbon policies.
Other developing nations might not gain because less capital
will be available as the income in the developed nations drops,
and it becomes more costly to import from developed nations
the capital goods that promote growth (e.g., machinery and
transportation equipment). See Chapters 8 and 9 for any empir-

"Consider four factors that affect location or trade effects. First,
do the non-tradable sectors account for a substantial share of
carbon emissions? Second, are energy costs a small or large
percentage of the total costs in key manufacturing sectors?
Third, is the burden of meeting an emission reduction target
partially borne by non-participating countries because of
changes mediated through international trade? For example,
developed nations could demand fewer exports from non-par-
ticipating countries. This would shift the terms of trade against
these countries, and they would bear some of the costs of
reducing GHGs. Fourth, how do resources shift across sectors
because of carbon policy? For instance, there could be a shift
from the energy-intensive sector to the domestic goods sector
that is non-energy intensive. The aggregate impact could be
positive or negative depending on the potential returns from
the non-energy intensive sector.

"The basic theoretical framework is that of a full employment,
open economy, and no international capital mobility (Dixit and
Norman, 1984). Within this model an emissions constraint
shifts the production possibility frontier inwards, as long as the
constraint requires some “no regret” measures to be undertak-
en. The spillover impact of this shift depends on whether the
emissions reductions have a greater impact on the production
of the export good, or on the import competing good. If it is the
former, abatements turn the terms of trade in favour of the
country that undertakes abatement and against the country that
does not. In these circumstances the non-abating country suf-
fers some welfare loss, while the abating country could be bet-
ter or worse off, depending on the size of the shift in terms of
trade relative to costs of abatement. Conversely, if emissions
have a greater impact on the production of the import-compet-
ing good, the terms of trade move in favour of the non-abating
country, which should have an increase in welfare. The analy-
sis of industrial reallocation considered in the previous section
becomes further complicated when international capital mobil-
ity is taken into account. Carbon constraints typically alter rel-
ative rates of return against abating and in favour of non-abat-
ing countries. A flow from the former to the latter is then like-
ly, which shifts further inwards the production possibility fron-
tier in the abating country. At the same time, it causes an out-
wards shift of the frontier in the non-abating country.
Modelling capital flows is notoriously difficult, however, and
no theoretical results can be obtained for the complex and
empirically relevant cases. Hence the indisputable need to use
simulation models and to undertake primary empirical
research. The welfare impacts of changes in international cap-
ital flows are seldom reported. Progress depends on the further
development of techniques such as decomposition analysis
(Huff and Hertel, 1996)!8 and multiple simulations in which
some variables are held constant to isolate their influence on
the final outcome.

"A special case of the income distributional weights approach is
to estimate the money value of impacts for different groups of
individuals or countries and then apply the average damage to
all individuals and countries. The best example of this is the
value attached to changes in the risk of death. These risks are
valued in terms of the statistical value of life, which caused
much controversy in SAR (IPCC 1996a, Chapter 6). The
“value of a statistical life’ (VSL) converts individual WTP to
reduce the risk of death into the value of a life saved, when it
is not known which life that will be. For example, if each per-
son in a community has a WTP of US$10 to reduce the risk of
death by one in a hundred thousand, then the collective WTP
of a group of 100,000 is US$1 million for a measure that
would, on average, save one life. Hence, the figure of US$1
million is referred to as the VSL. This measure is one way of
valuing changes in risks of mortality. Other ways include a
“human capital” approach, which values the loss of income and
multiplies it by the change in risk, or a “life years lost”
approach, which takes the WTP for life years that could be lost
as a result of changes in the survival probabilities an individual
faces. Of these, the VSL has been used most commonly in
recent years. The human capital approach is not well founded
in terms of welfare and the life years lost approach is still being

are scarce, and an attempt should be made to balance the costs

These public opinion surveys use a sequence of questions to
put a monetary value on personal preferences. However, since
people are responding to a survey rather than facing their own

represented in official economic and sectoral statistics, and the
prices used to value the resources are derived on a market
basis. Such information, however, is incomplete for developing
countries for which markets are incomplete, property rights are
not well established, and a significant part of the exchange

"Although cost is a key component of the decision as to which
policies to select, it is not the only consideration. Other factors
enter the decision, such as the impacts of policies on different
social groups in society, particularly the vulnerable groups, the
benefits of GHG limitation in other spheres, such as reduced air
pollution, and the impacts of the policies on broader concerns,
such as sustainability. In developing countries these other fac-
tors are even more important than in developed countries. GHG
limitation does not have as high a priority relative to other
goals, such as poverty reduction, employment, etc., as it does in
the wealthier countries. Indeed, it can be argued that the major
focus of policy will be development, poverty alleviation, etc.,
and that GHG limitation will be an addendum to a programme
designed to meet those needs. Accounting for the GHG compo-
nent may change the detailed design of a policy or programme,
rather than be the main issue that determines the policy.

"Markandya and Boyd (1999) and Halsnes and Markandya
(1999) assessed the implications for cost-effectiveness of using
an expanded cost-analysis framework compared with a focus
on direct costs. They examined a number of case studies,
including renewable energy options (biogas, solar water-heat-
ing systems, photovoltaic streetlights, and wind turbines),
DSM programmes, and a number of transportation sector
options. The expanded cost assessment includes a specific val-
uation for the welfare impacts of increased employment, local
environmental improvements related to reduced non-GHG pol-
lutants, and income distribution weights. The conclusion is that
in a number of cases the application of an expanded cost-
assessment framework has major implications for the cost-
effectiveness ranking of mitigation projects compared with
their ranking on direct costs alone. In particular, large differ-
ences in cost-effectiveness are seen for a biogas plant in
Tanzania, for which combined social costs considered in the
expanded framework go down to minus US$30/tCO, reduction
compared with a purely financial cost of plus US$20/tCO,.
This cost difference reflects a positive welfare impact on
presently unemployed low-income families and the time saved
through reduced fuelwood collection. The case examples gen-
erally suggest that the combined social costs of mitigation poli-
cies in developing countries in particular will be lower than the
purely financial costs, especially if the policies require present-
ly unemployed labour and reduce the damages from local non-
GHG pollutants. Similar studies for EITs reveal great large
value of ancillary benefits in the form of reduced air pollution
and increased employment, especially for carbon sink projects.

such supply constraints are seen in the financial sector, power

high transaction costs that originate from weak market link-
ages, limited information, inadequate institutional set-ups, and
policy distortions. Such market imperfections make it difficult
to establish reliable parameters such as price elasticity of
demand.

"Integration of market transformation processes in cost studies
should include an assessment of barrier removal policies. Such
policies include efforts to strengthen the incentives for
exchange (prices, capital markets, international capital, and
donor assistance), to introduce new actors (institutional and
human capacity efforts), and to reduce the risk of participation
(legal framework, information, and general policy context of
market regulation). Some of these policies can be reflected in
cost studies, such as barrier removal policies that address mar-
ket prices, capital markets, and technology transfers, while
other areas like capacity building need to be addressed in a
more qualitative way.
"	Text
"Traditional cost-benefit analysis suggests the use of shadow
prices to correct for market distortions (see Section 7.2.3.1).
Such a procedure is in line with the approach of CGE models.
In both these approaches mitigation policies and related costs
are assessed in relation to an “optimal resource allocation
case”, in which markets are in equilibrium and prices (and
thereby cost) reflect resource scarcities. However, these condi-
tions are far from those currently found in these countries, so
studies should consider how a transformation to the optimal
resource allocation case is likely to take place over a certain
time frame. Developing countries are presently undergoing
market-oriented economic reforms. However, the price distor-
tions are only partially and gradually being remedied because
of the high social costs associated with speedy reforms. The
complexities in modelling this process cannot be underestimat-
ed, and it should therefore be recognized that only part of the
transformation can be captured.

"A number of important interrelationships and spillovers occur
between the informal and formal sectors with regard to climate
change mitigation policies. An example is the potential to
introduce advanced production technologies in the energy and
agriculture sectors that, on the one hand, use domestic
resources (e.g., biomass) in a more sustainable way and, on the
other, improve efficiency and create capacity in local compa-
nies and institutions. The impact of introducing policy instru-
ments such as carbon taxes or energy subsidy removal also
depends on potential substitutions to non-commercial wood
fuels that might be unsustainable. Mitigation cost studies for
developing countries should, as far as possible, include an
assessment of energy consumption and biomass potential in the
informal sector and apply assumptions about price relations
and substitution elasticities between the formal and informal
sectors. Similarly studies should consider the capacity of enter-
prises in both the formal and informal sectors to adapt and
manage the advanced technologies that are suggested as cost-
effective mitigation options in national programmes.

Input-output (IO) models describe the complex interrelation-

ear equations. The coefficients of equations are fixed, which
means that factor substitution, technological change, and
behavioural aspects related to climate change mitigation poli-
cies cannot be assessed. IO models take aggregate demand as
given and provide considerable sectoral detail on how the
demand is met. They are used when the sectoral consequences
of mitigation or adaptation actions are of particular interest
(Fankhauser and McCoy, 1995). The high level of sectoral dis-
aggregation, however, requires strong restrictions that limit the
validity of the model to short runs (5—15 years).

CGE models construct the behaviour of e economic agents based
on microeconomic principles. The models typically simulate
markets for factors of production (e.g., labour, capital, energy),
products, and foreign exchange, with equations that specify
supply and demand behaviour. The models are solved for a set
of wages, prices, and exchange rates to bring all of the markets
into equilibrium. CGE models examine the economy in differ-
ent states of equilibrium and so are not able to provide insight
into the adjustment process. The parameters in CGE models
are partly calibrated (i.e., they are selected to fit one year of
data) and only partly statistically or econometrically deter-
mined (i.e., estimated from several years of data). Hence it is
difficult to defend the validity of some of the parameter values.

Macroeconomic models describe investments and consump-

dynamics associated with GHG emission reduction policies.
Final demand remains the principal determinant of the size of
the economy. The equilibrating mechanisms work through
quantity adjustments, rather than price. Temporary disequilib-
ria that result in underutilization of production capacity, unem-
ployment, and current account imbalances are possible. Many
macroeconomic models are available. They implicitly reflect
past behaviour in that the driving equations are estimated using
econometric techniques on time-series data. As a consequence,
macroeconomic models are well suited to consider the eco-
nomic effects of GHG emission reduction policies in the short-

"Dynamic energy optimization models, a class of energy sector
models, can also be termed partial equilibrium models. These
technology-oriented models minimize the total costs of the
energy system, including all end-use sectors, over a 40-50 year
horizon and thus compute a partial equilibrium for the energy
markets. The costs include investment and operation costs of
all sectors based on a detailed representation of factor costs and
assumptions about GHG emission taxes. Early versions of
these models assessed how energy demands can be met at least
cost. Recent versions allow demand to respond to prices.
Another development has established a link between aggregate
macroeconomic demand and energy demand. Optimization
models are useful to assess the dynamic aspects of GHG emis-
sions reduction potential and costs. The rich technology infor-
mation in the models is helpful to assess capital stock turnover
and technology learning, which is endogenous in some models.

stable with such variables. It is therefore common to adopt high

technologies were not directly captured. In contrast, bottom-up

provide greater detail on the structure of the economy and the

and the supply from main sectors (energy sector, transporta-

explore the potential for a possible decoupling of economic

by the shares of the purchase of a given input in intermediary

Assumptions on the structure of the tax system in the
baseline and mitigation cases, which include assump-
tions on tax substitution generated by the recycled rev-
enue of carbon taxes. These baseline assumptions have
to be projected into the future for a considerable period
if the revenue recycling is to be calculated correctly.
The total impact of the policy scenario that includes the

"torted the pre-existing tax the higher the welfare loss. This
means that a carbon tax can result in either a totally increased
burden (welfare loss of the whole tax system) or a double divi-
dend (in which the total welfare loss of the tax system is lower
because the carbon tax substitutes other “burdensome” taxes).
In general, however, a larger benefit from a carbon tax is found
in comparison with other instruments that meet the Kyoto
Protocol targets (e.g., permits issued gratis) than is found in
comparison between different methods of recycling.

"The net cost of climate policy depends on (1) the structure of
the tax system prior to the introduction of the mitigation policy
and (2) the nature of the mitigation policy (e.g., which sectors
are covered, what tax instruments are employed, and the way
that revenues are recycled). Estimates of the size of the effect
are discussed in Chapter 8. This is closely related to the double-
dividend literature, which is discussed in Section 7.3.3.1. As
noted there, the welfare loss (or burden) of a given climate pol-
icy depends on the structure of existing taxes. The more dis-

"The choice of targets and timing affects cost estimates.
Emission reduction targets are related to baseline case assump-
tions, and can be defined in relation to a given base year, or in
relation to expected future development trends. Targets defined
relative to base-year levels are accurate in terms of the target
for the future total GHG emissions, but the actual GHG emis-
sions reduction effort that is required is uncertain because
future emission levels are unknown. Reduction targets defined
as percentage reductions of future GHG emissions create
uncertainty as to the GHG emission levels.

"A number of studies have assessed climate change mitigation
costs given different regimes of global flexibility mechanism.7!
Climate change mitigation costs in these different policy
regimes depend on the specific definition of the policy instru-
ment, and on assumptions about market scale, competition, and
restrictions. It is generally expected that climate change miti-
gation costs decrease with increasing supply of carbon-reduc-
tion projects.2? Restrictions on this supply, or market imper-
fections in global markets for carbon-reduction projects, have
a tendency to increase the “price” of the projects (Burniaux,
1998; Mensbrugge, 1998).

"Target setting over the relevant time horizon involves a num-
ber of technical challenges. The time dimension of the emis-
sions reduction should reflect the dynamic aspects, such as
time and path dependence of emissions and climate change
damages. In addition, the costs of climate protection depend on
the “when” and “where” flexibility of specific emission targets.
Many of these time dimensions have been considered in I[AMs.
"	Text
"An OECD workshop in September 1998 (Mensbrugghe, 1998)
concluded that the emissions reduction costs rely on baseline
assumptions. Factors that lead to high cost estimates include
high population and GDP growth rates, a relatively clean fuel
mix, and relatively high energy costs. Among model parame-
ters two areas were emphasized: the ability to substitute labour
for energy, and the interfuel substitution elasticity. Low elas-
ticities lead to high costs.
"	Text
"Mitigation costs usually fall with greater flexibility for interna-
tional emissions trading. This suggests that constraints on trad-
ing increase the costs of any emission target. Some critics point
out that this argument does not address the potential positive
impacts on technological development that can arise from
implementing GHG emissions reduction policies domestically
in developed countries, such as incentives for innovation and
R&D.
"	Text
"The timing of mitigation policies also affects transition costs.
From a short-term perspective, mitigation is constrained by the
existing capital stock, infrastructure, and institutional structure
related to technology. One key cost-determinant during the
transition period is the turnover of capital stock. A time profile
for mitigation that requires early retirement of capital stock
increases the costs of achieving any target. This is predomi-
nantly an issue for developed countries, in which the capital
stock and infrastructure are well developed.
"	Text
"Mitigation costs vary across countries with different resource
endowments, economic structure and development, institution-
al structure, and various other factors. These cost differences
provide the opportunity to create and capture the gains from
exchange that arise through international co-operative flexibil-
ity mechanisms. Mechanisms such as international carbon
trading can facilitate collaborative emission reductions across
countries and regions, and thereby minimize global control
costs (see Chapter 6 for a detailed discussion on the issues
involved in establishing such mechanisms).

mitigation cost studies for the energy sector. It is based on SAR
(IPCC, 1996a, Chapter 8) and Halsnzs ef al. (1998). Some of
the new modelling areas that have important implications
include assumptions on technology change, transaction costs
and barrier removal policies, alternative demand projections
(including lifestyle), and ancillary benefits. Similarly, assump-
tions related to climate change mitigation policies with major
implications on costs include timing of the emissions reduction

"are between countries with a reduction commitment
specified in the Kyoto Protocol (termed Annex B coun-
tries) and countries without such a commitment.
Another mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol is Article 17
that facilitates emissions trading among Annex B coun-
tries.

Boundaries on GHG emissions trading markets, for
example that set the minimum amount of domestic
emission reductions for developed countries, specify a
relationship between domestic GHG emissions reduc-
tion efforts and the GHG emissions reduction they can
implement in collaboration with international partners.

"The time flexibility involves several issues addressed in top-
down and bottom-up models. Assumptions about technological
change are, as discussed in Section 7.3.4, critical in the studies,
and follow a simple “rule” that technological change over time
expands the range of available GHG emissions reduction
options. Technological change lowers the mitigation costs for a
long-term target relative to a short-term target. It is emphasized
that the mitigation costs and future technological change
depend on GHG emissions reduction policies initiated and
planned over the short- and long-term horizons. This reflects
the point that technological change itself relates to R&D pro-
grammes and to current technology implementation.

All else being equal, high growth increases GHG emissions.

Increased economic growth increases energy-using activities and also leads t
increased investment, which speeds the turnover of energy-using equipment.
Various assumptions on GHG emissions and resource intensities can be used 1
alternative scenarios.

Different sectors have different energy-intensities; structural change therefore
has a major impact on overall energy use.

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
"	Title
"Much of the difference in cost projections can be explained by
differences in these key variables.
"	Text
"For any class of models, the emissions baseline is critically
important in determining mitigation costs. It defines the size of
the reduction required for meeting a particular target. The
growth rate in carbon dioxide (CO,) emissions is determined by:

e aravth wate in arnace HAamactir nendict (MND\.-
"	Text
"growth rate in gross domestic product (GDP);
decline rate of energy use per unit of output, which
depends on structural change in the economy and on
technological development; and

decline rate of CO, emissions per unit of energy use.
"	List
"”

Virtually all analysts agree on the existence of “no regrets
options. Such options are typically assumed to be included in
the reference (no policy) scenario by economic modellers.
Even so, the overwhelming majority of emission baselines
show that emissions continue to rise well into the future. This
suggests that zero cost options are insufficient to reduce emis-
sions in the absence of policy intervention.
"	Text
"Economic studies vary widely in their estimate of mitigation
costs (both across and within countries). These differences
can be traced to assumptions about economic growth, the cost
and availability of existing and new technologies (both on the
supply and demand side of the energy sector), resource endow-
ments, the extent of “no regrets” options and the choice of pol-
icy instruments.
"	Text
"To cope with their wide range of diversity, the studies are
grouped into three categories. The first two focus on the near-
to-medium term. In one of these, the focus is exclusively on
domestic policies. In the other, the domestic/international
interface is explored. The third category focuses on the long-
term goals of climate policy and explores cost-effective imple-
mentation strategies. That is, what is the least-cost emission
reduction pathway for accomplishing a prescribed goal? The
major conclusions are summarized below.
"	Text
"Models can also be distinguished through their level of geo-
graphical disaggregation. Global models, which divide the
world into a limited number of regions, can provide important
insights with regard to international emissions trade, capital
flows, trade patterns, and the implications of alternative interna-
tional regimes regarding contributions to mitigation by various
regions of the globe. National models are more appropriate for
examining the effectiveness of alternative fiscal policies in off-
setting mitigation costs, the short-term effects of macro shocks
on employment and inflation, and the implications of domestic
burden-sharing rules for various sectors of the economy.
"	Text
"Mitigation costs to meet a prescribed target will be lower if the
tax revenues (or revenues from auctioned permits) are used to
reduce existing distortionary taxes (the so-called “double divi-
dend”). The preferred policy depends on the existing tax struc-
ture. Most European studies find that cutting payroll taxes is
more efficient than other types of recycling. A significant num-
ber of these studies conclude that, within some range of abate-
ment targets, the net costs of mitigation policies can be close to
zero and even slightly negative. Conversely, in the USA, stud-
ies suggest that reducing taxes on capital is more efficient, but
few models report negative costs.
"	Text
"The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) has as its ultimate goal the “stabilization of
greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that
will prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the cli-
mate system.” Whereas mitigation costs play only a secondary
role in establishing the target, they play a more important role
in determining how the target is to be achieved. UNFCCC states
that “policies and measures to deal with climate change should
be cost-effective so as to ensure global benefits at the lowest
possible costs.” This chapter examines the literature on the
costs of greenhouse gas mitigation policies at the national,
regional, and global levels. The net welfare gains or losses are
reported, including (when available) the ancillary benefits of
mitigation policies. These studies employ the full range of ana-
lytical tools described in Chapter 7, from the technologically
rich bottom-up models to more aggregate top-down models,
which link the energy sector to the rest of the economy.
"	Text
"Policies aimed at mitigating greenhouse gases can have posi-
tive and negative side effects (or ancillary benefits and costs,
not taking into account benefits of avoided climate change) on
society. Although this report overall emphasizes co-benefits of
climate policies with other policies (to reflect the reality in
many regions that measures are taken with multiple objectives
rather than climate mitigation alone), the literature that focus-
es on climate mitigation uses the term “ancillary benefits” of
specific climate mitigation measures. In spite of recent
progress in methods development, it remains very challenging
to develop quantitative estimates of the ancillary effects, bene-
fits and costs of GHG mitigation policies. Despite these diffi-
culties, in the short term, ancillary benefits of GHG policies
under some circumstances can be a significant fraction of pri-
vate (direct) mitigation costs. In some cases the magnitude of
ancillary benefits of mitigation may be comparable to the costs
of the mitigating measures, adding to the no regrets potential.
The exact magnitude, scale and scope of these ancillary bene-

demand, which in turn leads to a decline in the international
price of oil. As a response, non-Annex | countries may increase
their oil imports and emit more than they would otherwise. Oil-
importing non-Annex I countries may benefit, whereas oil
exporters may experience a decline in revenue.
"	Text
"fits and costs will vary with local geographical and baseline
conditions. In some circumstances, where baseline conditions
involve relatively low carbon emissions and population densi-
ty, benefits may be low. For the studies reviewed here, the
biggest share of the ancillary benefits is related to public
health.
"	Text
"A second example of spillover effects involves the location of
carbon-intensive industries. A constraint on Annex I emissions
reduces their competitiveness in the international marketplace.
Recent studies suggest that there will be some industrial relo-
cation abroad, with non-Annex I countries benefitting at the
expense of Annex I countries. However, non-Annex I countries
may be adversely affected by the decline in exports likely to
accompany a decrease in economic activity in Annex I coun-
tries.
"	Text
"Mitigation costs are highly dependent on assumptions about
trade in emission permits. Cost estimates are lowest when there
would be full global trading. That is, when reductions are made
where it is least expensive to do so regardless of their geo-
graphical location. Costs increase as the size of the emissions
market contracts. In the case of Annex B trading only, the
availability of excess assigned amount units in Russia and
Ukraine can be critical in lowering the overall mitigation costs.
Carbon trade provides some means for hedging against uncer-
tainties regarding emissions’ baselines and abatement costs. It
also reduces the consequences of an inequitable allocation of
assigned amounts.
"	Text
"The cost estimates of stabilizing atmospheric CO, concentra-
tions depend upon the concentration stabilization target, the
emissions pathway to stabilization and the baseline scenario
assumed. Unfortunately, the target is likely to remain the sub-
ject of intense scientific and political debate for some time.
What is needed is a decision-making approach that explicitly
incorporates this type of uncertainty and its sequential resolu-
tion over time. The desirable amount of hedging in the near
term depends upon one’s assessment of the stakes, the odds,
and the costs of policy intervention. The risk premium—the
amount that society is willing to pay to reduce risk—is ulti-
mately a political decision that differs among countries.
"	Text
"The concentration of CO, in the atmosphere is determined
more by cumulative rather than year-by-year emissions. A
number of studies suggest that the choice of emissions pathway
can be as important as the target itself in determining overall
mitigation costs. A gradual near-term transition from the
world’s present energy system minimizes premature retirement
of existing capital stock, provides time for technology devel-
opment, and avoids premature lock-in to early versions of
rapidly developing low-emission technology. On the other
hand, more aggressive near-term action would decrease
environmental risks associated with rapid climatic changes,
stimulate more rapid deployment of existing low-emission
technologies, provide strong near-term incentives to future
technological changes that may help to avoid lock-in to carbon
intensive technologies, and allow for later tightening of targets
should that be deemed desirable in light of evolving scientific
understanding.
"	Text
"It has long been recognized that international trade in emission
quota can reduce mitigation costs. This will occur when coun-
tries with high domestic marginal abatement costs purchase
emission quotas from countries with low marginal abatement
costs. This is often referred to as “where flexibility”. That is,
allowing reductions to take place where it is cheapest to do so
regardless of geographical location. It is important to note that
where the reductions take place is independent upon who pays
for the reductions. The chapter discusses the cost reductions
from emission trading for Annex B and full global trading
compared to a no-trading case. All of the models show signifi-
cant gains as the size of the trading market is expanded. The
difference among models is due in part to differences in their
baseline, the cost and availability of low-cost substitutes on
both the supply and demand sides of the energy sector, and the
treatment of short-term macro shocks. In general, all calculat-
ed gross costs for the non-trading case are below 2% of GDP
(which is assumed to have increased significantly in the period
considered) and in most cases below 1%. Annex-B trading
would generally decrease these costs to well below 1 % of
GDP for OECD regions. The extent to which domestic policies
relying on revenue recycling instruments can lower these fig-
ures is conditional upon the articulation of these policies and
the design of trading systems.

"A second lesson of SAR is that, for both B-U and T-D models,
the differences in cost assessment usually result from differ-
ences in the definition of baseline scenarios and in the time
frame within which a given abatement target has to be met.
Less often, they result from divergences in the costs of achiev-
ing this target from the same baseline scenario. This, in turn,
relates to:

"The third evolution is the development of studies on various
abatement pathways towards given long-run concentration tar-
gets and on rules for emissions quota allocation among coun-

consequences of various abatement timetables on the behav-
iour of carbon prices and on the sharing of the overall burden
among countries. They provide basic information about the
equity of various designs of climate policies.
"	Text
"The third lesson is that some of the determinants of costs are
beyond the field of energy and environmental policy stricto
sensu. This is why SAR emphasizes the importance of devel-
oping multiple baseline scenarios to support policymaking.
This issue of the multiplicity of baseline scenarios is specifi-
cally important for the developing countries and countries with
economies in transition. These regions were underinvestigated
compared with the number of studies available for OECD
countries.

about population, the rate and structure of economic

¢ — its level of suboptimality (higher efficiency in the base-
line scenario results in higher mitigation-costs esti-
mates for a given target, while the existence of market
failure, which enhances GHG emissions, or of fiscal
distortions provides a possibility for economic and
environmental double dividends).
"	List
"Chapters 8 and 9 of Second Assessment Report (SAR) (IPCC,
1996) reviewed the literature on costs of greenhouse gas
(GHG) mitigation prior to 1995. At that period, the debate was
dominated by the differences in results from “bottom-up” (B-
U) models and “top-down” (T-D) models. The former contain
more details of technology and physical flows of energy, and
the latter give more consideration to linkages between a given
sector and a set of measures and macroeconomic parameters
like gross domestic product (GDP) and final household con-
sumption.
"	Text
"Since SAR, the most important advance is the treatment of new
topics related to linkages between national policies and the
international framework of these policies in the context of the
pre-Kyoto and post-Kyoto negotiation process. Of specific
interest is the articulation between international emissions trad-
ing systems and domestic policies (taxes, domestic emissions
trading, and standards). This link has been made in national
models and global models that provide a description of rela-
tionships among various regions of the world. Some models
represent solely GHG emissions trading, while others also
incorporate energy flows, trade of other goods, and capital
flows. In this context, while SAR discussed only the carbon
leakage between abating and non-abating economies, an
increasing number of studies have captured spillover effects
(see Box 8.1) such as those triggered by trade effects and the
modification of the capital flows.
"	Text
"B-U models showed that energy efficiency gains of 10%-30%
above baseline trends could be realized at negative to zero net
costs over the next two or three decades. However, the costs of
stabilizing emissions at 1990 levels reported by T-D analysis
for Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) countries were less optimistic, in the range -0.5% to
2% of GDP. SAR devoted much effort to explain the reasons
for these differences and their meaning for policymakers. B-U
models identify negative-cost mitigation potentials because of
the difference between the best available techniques and those
currently in use; the key question is then the extent to which
market imperfections that inhibit access to these potentials can
be removed cost-effectively by policy initiatives. T-D analyses
focus on the overall macroeconomic effect of new incentive
structures, such as carbon taxes or subsidies for energy effi-
ciency; their results reflect a judgement on the capacity of non-
price policies (market reforms, information, capacity building)
to enhance the effectiveness of such signals to decarbonize the
economy. The lesson is that, for a given abatement target, the
content of the policy mix (carbon tax, carbon-energy tax, or
auctioned emissions trading system) is as important as the
assumptions regarding technology.

"Evaluation of the economic impacts of domestic mitigation
policies can no longer be made independently of the linkages
between these policies and the international framework.
However, it is important to disentangle the mechanisms that
are themselves independent of the international regimes from
those specifically driven by the interplay between these
regimes and domestic policies. In addition, the existence of an
international framework does not rule out the importance of
domestic policies for addressing the specific problems of each
country.

"exports, and changes in consumer surplus that result from mit-
igation actions. In all the studies, it is customary to report the
mitigation cost as the incremental cost of some policy scenario
relative to that of a baseline scenario. The total cost of mitiga-
tion is usually presented as a total net present value (NPV)
using a social discount rate selected exogenously (the NPV
may be further transformed into an annualized equivalent).
Many (but not all) report also the marginal cost of GHG abate-
ment (in US$/tonne of CO,-equivalent), which is the cost of
the last tonne of GHG reduced. Chapter 7 discusses cost con-
cepts and discount rates in more depth.

"The results of these studies group into three large clusters.
Section 8.2 reviews the studies that entail near-to-mid term
impacts of domestic mitigation policies on factors such as
GDP, welfare, income distribution, and social and environ-

contains the results of mitigation studies that examine the inter-
face between these domestic policies and the international con-
text: international trade regimes, and spillover effects of the
implementation of mitigation measures by a country or a block
of nations on other countries. Section 8.4 reviews studies that
focus on social, environmental, and economic impacts of alter-
nate pathways to meet a range of concentration stabilization
pathways beyond the Kyoto Protocol. They encompass a
longer time horizon and do not incorporate details of macro
economic policies, but highlight the question of technological
change over the long run and the consequences of various sets
of national targets.
"	Text
"urrent B-U analysis can be grouped in three categories:

Engineering economics calculations performed tech-
nology-by-technology (Krause, 1995; LEAP (1995),
Von Hippel and Granada (1993); UNEP, 1994a; Brown
et al., 1998; Conniffe et al., 1997). The costs and reduc-
tions from the large number of actions are aggregated
into whole-economy totals in these studies. Each tech-
nology (or other action on energy demand) is assessed
independently via an accounting of its costs and sav-
ings (investment costs, operational and maintenance
cost, fuel costs or savings, and emissions savings).
Once these elements are estimated, a unit cost (per
tonne of GHG reduction) is computed for each action.
The unit costs are then sorted in ascending order, and
thus the actions are ordered from least expensive to the
most expensive, per tonne of abatement, to create a cost
curve. This approach requires a very careful examina-
tion of the interactions between the various actions on
the cost curve: it is often the case that the cost and GHG
reduction attached to an action depends on those of
other actions in the same economy. Although the sim-
pler interactions are easily accounted for by careful
analysis, there exist many other instances in which
complex, multi-measure interactions are very difficult
to evaluate without the help of a more complex model
that captures the system’s effects. As an example, con-
sider simultaneously: (a) changing the mix of electrici-
ty generation, (b) increasing interprovincial trade of
electricity, and (c) implementing actions to conserve
electricity in several end-use sectors. As each of these
three actions has an impact on the desirability and pen-
etration of each other action, such a combination
requires many iterations that assess the three types of
action separately, before an accurate assessment of the
full portfolio can be obtained.

Integrated partial equilibrium models that facilitate the
integration of multiple GHG reduction options and the
aggregation of costs. To achieve this, the majority of B-
U studies use the whole energy system (MARKAL,
MARKAL-MACRO, MARKAL-MATTER, EFOM,
MESSAGE, NEMS, PRIMES!). These models have
the advantage of simultaneously computing the prices

"An important part of climate policy debates is underpinned by
a lasting controversy between believers and non-believers in
the existence of a large untapped efficiency potential in the
economy. If there, this potential could be realized at such a
small societal cost that it would be more than compensated by
cost savings that accrue from the efficiency improvements.
Options that have a negative net social cost add up to an over-
all negative cost potential that may be quite large. Figure 8./ is
a sketch of the successive marginal costs of abatement, as a
function of GHG reduction relative to some baseline point A.
The total cost is simply the area between the curve and the hor-

"Several studies go further: they are based on partial equilibri-
um models in which energy service demands are sensitive to
prices. Therefore, even the quantities of energy services may
increase or decrease in carbon scenarios, relative to the base
case. For these models report not only the direct technical
costs, but also the loss or gain in consumer surplus because of
altered demands for energy services. The results of this new
generation of partial equilibrium B-U models tend to be closer
than those of other B-U models to the results of the general
equilibrium T-D models, which are also discussed in this chap-
ter. Loulou and Kanudia (1999) argue that, by making demands
endogenous in B-U models, most of the side-effects of policy
scenarios on the economy at large are captured. When a partial
equilibrium model is used, the cost reported is the net loss of
social surplus (NLSS), defined as the sum of losses of produc-
ers and consumers surpluses (see Chapter 7).

and/or equilibrium computation routines similar to
those used in T-D approaches. They increasingly cover
both the supply and demand sides, and include mecha-
nisms to make economic demands responsive to the
changing prices induced by carbon policies.
Furthermore, many implementations of these models
are multiregional, and represent explicitly the trading

als.

Simulations models (based on models such as ISTUM)

economic agents (firms, consumers) are allowed to
make investment decisions that are not guided solely by
technical costs, but also by considerations of conve-
nience, preference, and so on. Such models deviate
from least-cost ones, and so they tend to produce larg-
er abatement costs than least-cost models, all things

"Contrary to the studies discussed above, the partial equilibrium
studies reviewed in this section do not report negative costs.
This is because the least-cost algorithms employed, which are
powerful to compute the incremental cost of the system with
and without a carbon constraint (i.e., point B in Figure 8.1),
demand a set of somewhat arbitrary parameters to be calibrat-
ed in such a way that they calculate a suboptimal baseline; but
such an operation demands resorting to a set of somewhat
arbitary parameters and the results are less easy to interpret.
This is why the B-U studies reported hereafter explore only the
section of the cost curve with positive carbon prices (section
CD in Figure 8.1).

"These arguments should not be used to refute the very exis-
tence of negative cost potentials. They indicate that the applic-
ability of non-price policy measures apt to overcome barriers
to the exploitation of these potentials must be given serious
attention. Some empirical observations do confirm that active
sectoral policies can result in significant efficiency gains, in
demand-side management for electricity end-uses for example.
However, the many sources of gaps between technical costs
and economic costs cannot be ignored (see the taxonomy of
Jaffe and Stavins, 1994). The few existing observations
(Ostertag, 1999) suggest that the transaction costs may repre-
sent, in many cases, a large fraction of the costs of new tech-
nology, and there is always an uncertainty about the efficiency
and the political acceptability of the policies suggested in the
above studies. This issue is clearly exemplified by the set of
studies carried out in the USA and collected under the name
“5-LAB studies”. In these, some scenarios produce positive
incremental costs and others negative costs, depending on the
aggressiveness with which efficiency measures are implement-
ed (Interlaboratory Working Group, 1997; Brown et al., 1998).
"	Text
"Krause (1995, 1996) identifies two main reasons why the neg-
ative cost area may be quite large: untapped potential for effi-
ciency gains mainly in end-use technologies, both on the
demand and on supply sides. Several major studies concretize
this view in Europe as well as in North America (USA and
Canada). For Europe, the monumental IPSEP reports (summa-
rized in Krause et al. (1999)) conclude that emissions could be
reduced by up to 50% below the 1990 level by 2030, at a neg-
ative overall cost. This involves the judicious implementation
of technologies and practices in all sectors of the economy, and
the application of a large number of government policies
(incentives, efficiency standards, and educational). In the US,
some of the 5-Lab studies (Brown et al., 1997a, 2000, particu-
larly the HE/LC scenario) indicate that the Kyoto reduction tar-
get could be reached at negative overall cost ranging from
—US$7 billion to -US$34 billion. Another study based on the
NEMS model (Koomey et al., 1998) indicates that 60% of the
Kyoto gap could be bridged with an overall increase in the US
GDP. The latter study contrasts with another NEMS study
(Energy Information Administration, 1998) that indicates GDP
losses from 1.7% to 4.2% (depending on the extent of permit
trading and sink options) for the USA to reach the Kyoto tar-
gets. Laitner (1997, 1999) further stresses the impact of effi-
cient technologies on the aggregate cost of mitigation in the
USA. In Canada, the MARKAL model was used with and
without certain efficiency measures in various sectors (Loulou
and Kanudia, 1998; Loulou et al., 2000): the results show costs
of Kyoto equal to US$20 billion without the additional effi-
ciency measures, versus -US$26 billion when efficiency mea-
sures are included in the database. Again in Canada, the
ISTUM model was used (Jaccard et al., 1996, Bailie er al.,
1998) considering a set of pro-active options. For example, in
the residential sector large emissions reductions of 17% to 25%
relative to 1990 could be achieved as early as 2008 with many
negative costs options, and beyond that level of reduction, the
marginal costs is ranging from US$25 to US$89/tC.

"Several studies are not represented in Figure 8.2, since only

"Policy assumptions. The results summarized in Figure
8.2 are based mostly on partial equilibrium models,
which tend to approach general equilibrium computa-
tions, such as AIM, NEMS, MARKAL, MARKAL-
MACRO, PRIMES, CIMS, etc. Some of these models
allow evaluation of the impact on mitigation cost of the
redistribution of the proceeds of a carbon tax (the
results obtained with the AIM model for Japan
(Kainuma ef al., 1999, 2000) show very clearly that
suitable redistribution reduces the marginal cost of
abatement).

Modelling differences. Some models include partial
economic feedbacks in the form of demand elasticities,
as for example MARKAL (Loulou and Kanudia,
1999a), and for these models the abatement marginal
costs are generally lower than when demands are fixed,
because it becomes unnecessary to tap the most costly
technological options. MARKAL-MACRO and NEMS
include macroeconomic components in the computa-
tion of the equilibrium, and therefore qualify as gener-

"al equilibrium models, albeit simplified ones. In addi-
tion, these two models include behavioural considera-
tions in the calculation of the equilibrium, which tend
to raise the cost of abatement, compared to least-cost
models such as MARKAL.

Scenario variation. The variety of scenarios used is
quite large, as a result of varying some or all of the rel-
evant elements. These include whether the technologies
are allowed to penetrate freely or in a limited fashion
(typically renewables, nuclear, and some new end-use
technologies), the basket of GHG gases considered
(CO, alone versus multigas studies), assumed econom-
ic growth, and sectoral scope (energy only versus
whole economy).

Example. To illustrate the above comments, Figure 8.2
indicates that at a marginal cost of less than
USS 100/tCO2,,, the US emissions would still be larger
in 2010 than in 1990, according to the NEMS (Energy
Information Administration, 1998) and MARKAL
(Interagency Analytical Team, 1997) studies. Note that
NEMS predicts higher marginal costs than MARKAL
for the same emission level, as expected, since NEMS
includes many behavioural considerations, whereas
MARKAL is a least-cost model. Japan’s emissions
would be reduced by 1% to 8% (AIM studies (Kainuma
et al., 1999, 2000); Ireland’s (Conniffe et a/., 1997) and
Italy’s (Contaldi and Tosato, 1999) emissions would
also increase, whereas Canada’s emissions would
decrease by 6% (MARKAL study (Loulou er al.,
1998)). The several European studies show a wide
range of reductions, from relatively small reductions
(PRIMES study (Capros et al., 1999a)) to medium or
large reductions with the various MARKAL studies
(Gielen and Pieters, 1999; Gielen er al., 1999a; Ybema
et al., 1999). These large variations are mainly
explained by the modelling and scenario assumptions:
PRIMES marginal costs are expected to be larger than
MARKAL/’s (just as NEMS costs were larger than
MARKAL’s in the US case). In addition, scenario
assumptions vary across studies: the number of gases
modelled, degree of efficiency of the instrument used
across the EU countries, and availability of internation-
al permits trading.

"(energy per GDP), but to increase significantly their
total emissions. For such countries, a net reduction of
GHG emissions below a base year’s emissions is usu-
ally costly. Typically, many fast-developing countries
in East and South East Asia are in this category. In the
studies cited above, their emissions “reductions” are
often computed relative to the baseline rather than to a
fixed base year.

¢ Energy intensity. The degree of energy intensity of an
economy acts in opposing directions when the econo-
my wishes to achieve net emissions reductions: on the
one hand, a high degree of energy intensity may occur
because that the country has not yet implemented some
efficiency measures implemented elsewhere. On the
other hand, such an economy may have been built on
energy, and may thus find it hard to veer to a different,
less energy-intensive mode, in a short time. Its devel-
opment path is somewhat frozen, at least in the short
term. The higher the carbon intensity, the more impor-
tant the time frame of abatement. Such a pattern is
observable in North America; despite its rapid capital
turnover in the industry, the large inertia in sectors such
as transportation is a determining factor of high abate-
ment cost when the required abatement implies short
term actions on these sectors.

* Other specific conditions. For example, Germany faces
a very special situation because of the reunification in
1990 to 1991. The East German part of the country
emits much less now than in 1990, and the country as a
whole is able to effect significant reductions at essen-
tially zero or very low cost, up to a certain point,
beyond which its marginal cost may well accelerate
considerably.

boilers and motors to be attractive climate change mitigation
options and this conclusion is in line with the conclusions of
earlier UNEP studies (UNEP 1994b). A number of transporta-

the low-cost options. Most of the studies have included a num-

sectoral and distributional consequences of climate policies is
examined. Finally, in a third step, the ancillary benefits from
the joint reduction of carbon emissions and other pollutants are
considered to complete the picture.

"Clearly, the impact of policy scenarios has a large influence on
abatement costs. Certain studies propose a series of public
measures (regulatory and economic) that tap deep into the
technical potential of low carbon and/or energy-efficient tech-
nologies. In many cases, such policies show low or negative
costs. A comparison with least-cost approaches is difficult
because these evaluate systematically both the baseline and the
policy scenario as optimized systems and do not incorporate
market or institutional imperfections in the current world. It
would be of great interest to conduct a more systematic com-
parison of the results obtained via the various B-U approaches,
so as to establish the true cause of the discrepancies in report-
ed costs. A timid step in this direction is illustrated in Loulou
and Kanudia (1999a).

"high, although the average abatement cost is reasonably low, or
even negative. This is because the initial reductions of GHG
emissions may have a very low (or negative) cost, whereas
additional reductions have, in general, a much higher marginal
cost. This fact is captured in the curve representing marginal
abatement cost versus reduction quantity, which starts with
negative marginal costs, as illustrated in Figure 8.1. The initial
portion of the curve (section A—B) exhibits negative cost
options, which may add up to a significant portion of the reduc-
tions targetted by a given GHG scenario. As the reduction tar-
get increases (section B—C—D of the curve), the marginal cost
becomes positive, and also eventually the total mitigation cost
if the reduction target is large enough. But there is systemati-
cally a wedge between the marginal and total costs of abate-
ment, and this wedge is all the more important as the macro-
economic impacts of climate policies are driven in large part by
the marginal costs (because the latter dictate the change in rel-
ative commodity prices). They are driven only modestly by the
total amount of abatement expenditures.

"This leads to a general discussion about the extent to which
all these results suffer from a lack of representation of trans-
action costs, which are usually incurred in the process of
switching technologies or fuels. This category of transaction
cost encompasses many implementation difficulties that are
very hard to capture numerically. The general conclusion
from SAR (that costs computed using the B-U approach are
usually on the low side compared to costs computed via
econometric models, which assume a history-based behaviour
of the economic agents) is no longer generally applicable,
since some B-U models take a more behavioural approach.
Models such as ISTUM, NEMS, PRIMES, or AIM implicitly
acknowledge at least some transaction costs via various
mechanisms, with the result that market share is not deter-
mined by visible (market-based) least-cost alone. Least-cost
modellers (using MARKAL, EFOM, MESSAGE, ETO) also
attempt to impose penetration bounds, or industry-specific
discount rates, which approximately represent the unknown
transaction costs and other manifestations of resistance to
change exhibited by economic agents. In both cases these
improvements result in partially eschewing the “sin” of opti-
mism and blur the division between B-U and T-D models.
While the former, indeed, tend to be less optimistic when they
account for real behaviours, it is symmetrically arguable that
the latter underestimate the possibility of altering these
behaviours through judicious policies or better information.
All this area still remains underworked.

"The starting point in a discussion of a double dividend is how
expensive it is to raise government income, that is, how big is
the marginal cost of funds (MCF). A high MCF gives more
scope for a double dividend than a small MCF in the economy.
This arises because the parameters that determine the magni-
tude of the double-dividend (see Chapter 7) are:

"Specific features of the tax systems and markets of the produc-
tion factors (labour, capital, and energy) ultimately determine
the presence or absence of a strong double dividend. For exam-
ple, a double dividend is likely if production factors are very
distorted by prior taxation or specific market conditions, if
there is a problem of trade-balance because of the import of
fossil energy, or if consumer choice is highly distorted because
of tax-deducible spending provisions (Parry and Bento, 2000).

"In the 1990s there was considerable interest in how revenue-
neutral carbon taxes may mitigate this effect on the economy
by enabling the government to cut the marginal rates of pre-
existing taxes, such as income, payroll, and sales taxes. The
possibility is a double dividend policy (Pearce, 1992), by both
(1) improving the environment and (2) offsetting at least part
of the welfare losses of climate policies by reducing the costs
of the tax system (see the discussion in Chapter 7). The same
mechanism occurs when nationally auctioned permits are used;
for simplicity, the term carbon tax is used in the rest of this
chapter, except when the distinction between these two instru-
ments is necessary.
"	Text
"While the weak form of double dividend enjoys broad support
from theoretical and numerical studies, the strong double divi-
dend hypothesis is less broadly supported and more controver-
sial. Indeed, reaching an economical dividend is impossible
when the economy is at full employment and if all other taxa-
tion is optimal (abstracting for the environmental externality).
Therefore, it may be argued that the double dividend accrues
from the tax reform, independently of the climate policy.
However, empirical models capture the fact that, in the real
world, a carbon tax or auctioned emissions permits will not be
implemented after the enforcement of an optimal fiscal reform.
To the contrary, introducing a new tax may be a sine qua non
condition to the fiscal reform. For a given carbon tax revenue,
models help interpret the best way to recycle this revenue.

"of the climate policy. The reason is that these revenues are, in
principle, available to offset some or all of the costs of the mit-
igation policy. When emission targets go beyond the negative
cost potentials, there is a general agreement among economists
(see Chapters 6 and 7) that if standards are used (or if emis-
sions permits are allocated for free) the resultant social cost is
higher than the total abatement expenditures. Producers pass
part of the marginal abatement cost on to consumers through
higher selling prices, which implies a loss of consumer surplus.
If the elasticity of supply is quite high, this might lead to a net
loss of producer surplus. However, if the elasticity of supply is
fairly low, overall (or net) producer surplus can rise when poli-
cies cause a restriction in output, because the policy-generated
rents per unit of production enjoyed by producers more than
compensate for the net decrease in sales.

"When the revenues of carbon taxes are returned in a lump-sum
fashion to households and firms, the tax-interaction effect is sys-
tematically higher than the revenue-recycling effect. Also the
net cost of climate policy is higher than its gross cost (while
lower than that with a no-tax policy, see A, and A, in Figure
8.3). However, it is possible to improve this result by targetting
tax revenues to cuts in the most distortionary taxes; this can
yield either a weak or a strong form of double dividend
(Goulder, 1995a). The weak double dividend occurs as long as
there is a revenue-recycling effect due to the swap between car-
bon taxes and the most distortionary taxes. Mitigation costs are
systematically lower when revenues are recycled this way than
when they are returned lump sum. The strong double dividend is
more difficult to obtain. It requires that the (beneficial) revenue-
recycling effect more than offset the combination of the prima-
ry cost and the tax-interaction effect. In this case, the net cost of
abatement is negative (at least within some range). As discussed
in Chapter 7, this is possible if, prior to the introduction of the
mitigation policy, the tax system is already highly inefficient
along non-environmental dimensions. In terms of Figure 8.3,
the revenue-recycling effect is represented by the downward
ut from curve A, to curve A, or A,. If the shift is from A, to
>, the weak double dividend occurs, but not the strong double
dividend If the shift is from A, to A, not only does the weak
double dividend occur, but the. strong double dividend is real-
ized as well, since the net costs are negative within a range.

of auctioned permits is through a lump-sum transfer. Such
recycling does not correspond to any likely policy in the real

benchmark to which other forms of recycling can be compared.
In addition, they allow an easy intercountry comparison of the

"A first conclusion that could be drawn from Table 8.4 is that no
strict correlations occur between the necessary carbon tax to
reach a certain emission target and the GDP loss faced by a
country. While the carbon tax in Japan is systematically higher
than that for the USA, most studies conclude lower GDP loss-
es in Japan than in the USA. In general, the carbon taxes are
highest in OECD Europe and Japan, while the GDP losses are
highest in the USA and Other OECD countries. This absence
of strict correlation between marginal taxes and GDP losses is
explained by the pre-existing energy supply, the structural eco-
nomic features, and the pre-existing fiscal system. For
instance, if a country relies more on renewable energy, and is
specialized in low carbon-intensive industry, the impact of a
given level of carbon tax will be lower. However, as the burden
of emission reductions falls only on a few sectors, the carbon
tax for a given target will be higher.

"The comparative study carried out by the Energy Modeling
Forum (EMF, Stanford University) is very useful in this
respect: EMF-16 (1999) examined the costs of compliance
with the Kyoto Protocol as calculated by more than a dozen
modelling teams in the USA, Australia, Japan, and Europe
(Table 8.4). Most of the models used are general equilibrium
models. While not strictly comparable to the marginal techni-
cal abatement costs reported in Section 8.2.1, the magnitude of
the carbon tax used in these models is determined again by the
difference between the costs of marginal source of supply
(including conservation) with and without the target. As in the
B-U models, this parameter depends in turn on such factors as
the size of the necessary emissions reductions, assumptions
about the cost and availability of carbon-based and carbon-free
technologies, the fossil fuel resource base, and short- and long-
term price elasticity. Also important is the choice of base year:

European countries as a result of the pre-existing tax structure
and of the type of labour-market regulation that prevails in
these countries. Note that a systematic outcome of these stud-

increase in total consumption or social welfare, which leads
some authors to discuss the employment double dividend as

(1999b) demonstrate (Figure 8.6) that the increase of employ-
ment in the EU countries due to payroll tax reduction is far
higher under the assumption of wage rigidities than under the
assumption of a classic flexible labour market. In the same way,
Bernard and Vielle (1999c) do not conclude to a strong double
dividend in France, while Hourcade et al. (2000a) find a mod-
est increase in total consumption of households (up to 0.2% for
carbon taxes up to US$100/tC) because they incorporate struc-

1999), econometrically driven and neo-Keynesian in nature,
provides the most optimistic results; they indeed incorporate
the rigidities of the real labour markets. It systematically finds
a net increase in GDP in Europe (from 0.8% to 2.2%), except
for the Netherlands, with a maximum in the UK. The DRI and
LINK models, similar in nature to E3M3, do not find such a
gain for the US economy, but a loss of 0.39%.

"The magnitude of the second dividend (the net economic ben-
efit of tax recycling) is not independent of the abatement tar-
get. For a given fiscal system, it is determined by parameters
for which sizes vary with the taxation levels (e.g., the elastici-
ty of decarbonization in the production sector and in household
consumption, the crowding-out effect between carbon-saving
technological change and non-biased technological change).
Unfortunately, only a few studies report the range of taxes in
which the double-dividend hypothesis holds. Hourcade et al.
(2000a) found a curve similar to A, in Figure 8.3; after an opti-
mum around US$100/tC, the double dividend tends to vanish
in the same way. Hakonsen and Mathiesen (1997) found that
tax recycling is actually welfare improving in the range of a
5% to 15% reduction in CO, emissions. Capros et al. (1999c)
are more optimistic in this respect. They found that the final
consumption of households in the EU is increases (about 1%)
when the abatement target increases from 20% to 25%. The
marginal increase is, however, lower than when the abatement

"For France, Schubert and Beaumais (1998) found, for a carbon
tax of US$140/tC, that these tax recycling schemes are less
efficient in terms of welfare than recycling through payroll tax,
because they trigger no mechanism that enhances employment
and general activity. Bernard and Vielle (1999c) confirm this
result for the same country. In a short-run analysis for Sweden,
Brannlund and Gren (1999) found that private income remains
almost unchanged if a reduction in VAT is implemented,
because it compensates the regressive income effect of carbon
taxation. Nevertheless, as the income increase in this study is
relatively important compared to the changes in prices, taxes
can be raised without altering consumer behaviour in any con-
siderable way. But this balance may not be preserved in the
case of higher carbon taxes.

"idend for the USA in the case of labour-tax recycling, the
Jorgenson—Wilcoxen model supports this notion when recy-
cling takes the form of a reduction in capital taxes (Shackleton,
1998). The pre-existing marginal distortions from taxes on cap-
ital are considerably larger than those from labour taxes.
Consequently, according to Jorgenson (1997), if the revenues
were rebated to consumers in the form of reduced taxes on
wage and salary incomes, the cost would be reduced to 0.6%,
or by a factor of three compared to the lump-sum recycling
case. But if the taxes were rebated on capital income instead,
the loss would turn into a gain (0.19%). This higher attractive-
ness of capital taxation recycling is not found in European
countries, with the exception of the Newage model for
Germany (Boehringer, 1997).

"The other recycling modes have been scrutinized less systemat-

for all the scenarios in which energy taxes were used to offset
reductions in payroll taxes, rises in GDP and employment were
achieved. A decrease in GDP and employment resulted in the
only scenario in which energy taxes were used to reduce the
budget deficit. Fitz Gerald and McCoy (1992) found the same
type of result for repayment of national debt in Ireland (1% GDP

"Economic analysis can define the compensation necessary to
offset these negative distributional effects but, in the real
world, winners cannot (or are not willing to) compensate
losers. This is especially relevant when the losers suffer heavy
impacts and the winners enjoy only marginal gains, which
leads to the so-called political mobilization bias (Olson, 1965;
Keohane and Nye, 1998) when the losers are more ready to
organize a lobbying and incur mobilization costs than the win-
ners (Williamson, 1996). Under such circumstances, policies
yielding the largest aggregate net benefits may prove very dif-
ficult to enforce. Economic models provide no answer to this

"2.8%, respectively, in 2010 relative to the baseline, and welfare,
measured in Hicksian equivalent variation (defined in Chapter
7), drops by 1.1% and 1.8%. If part of the revenues raised by car-
bon taxes is recycled by equally reducing indirect taxes by 5%
and 10%, respectively, for all sectors the welfare effect is
markedly improved, and there may even be a gain. Garbaccio et
al. (1998) report an even more optimistic view from their simu-
lations on a dynamic CGE model for China. Uniform emissions
reductions of 5%, 10%, and 15% from baseline were studied, and
carbon tax revenues recycled by reducing all other taxes propor-
tionally. In all of the alternative scenarios, a very small decline in
GDP occurs in the first year of the simulation. However, in each
case, GDP is increased in every year thereafter. The result arises
through a shift from consumption to investment brought about
indirectly through the imposition of the carbon tax. Thus, a dou-
ble dividend may be achieved in China.

"It should be noted however, that, even if the only one available
study for China suggests that opportunities for revenue recy-
cling exist in developing countries, no swapping generalization
can be made at this stage. While theoretical modelling and
empirical evidence suggest that such opportunities are available
in many OECD countries, developing countries in many cases
start from a different fiscal baseline (e.g., fewer entrenched dis-
tortionary payroll taxes). They also have other potentially
underused tax bases that may become more developed as their
economies grow at rates that typically exceed growth rates in
OECD countries. In developing countries, direct welfare losses
associated with a carbon tax may, therefore, reduce opportuni-
ties for mitigation within the fiscal reform policy envelope. At
this stage, however, insufficient evidence exists either to con-
firm or to substantiate these hypotheses; studies to date have
mainly concentrated on developed countries and their conclu-
sions may not be directly transferable.

"Tax differentiation is studied in a CGE model for Sweden in
Bergman (1995), who compares its effect with a uniform tax
for given emission targets. The tax rate applicable to the indus-
trial firms is set to one-quarter of the tax rate for non-industri-
al firms and households. The GDP loss increases slightly com-
pared to the uniform tax, but it is still quite small. However, the
purchasing power of the aggregated incomes of labour and
capital is significantly reduced. Consequently, tax differentia-
tion does not seem to have as much of an adverse effect as full
tax exemption. The reason is that all sectors pay a carbon tax
when taxes are differentiated, while this is not the case for tax
exemptions. Thus, the burden on sectors that pay the highest
carbon tax is not that large, and hence results in lower welfare
losses.

"impacts of carbon taxes through tax exemptions are very high.
Bohringer and Rutherford (1997) show for Germany that
exemptions to energy- and export-intensive industries increase
the costs of meeting a 30% CO, reduction target by more than
20%. Jensen (1998) has similar findings for Denmark with
respect to a unilateral reduction of CO, emissions by 20%
(Jensen, 1998). To exempt six production sectors that emit 15%
of Denmark’s total emissions implies significantly greater wel-
fare costs (equivalent variation) than full taxation to meet the
same abatement target. Namely, welfare loss of 1.9% and a car-
bon tax on the non-exempted sectors of US$70/tCO,, against a
welfare loss of 1.2% and a carbon price of US$40/tCO, in the
no-exemption case (uniform taxes). A similar result is found in
Hill (1999) for Sweden: the welfare costs of using exemptions
are more than 2.5 times higher than in the uniform carbon tax
case for a 10% emission decrease. The high costs of tax
exemption are also confirmed by a US study (Babiker er al.,
2000).

"Annex B countries are currently considering the creation of a
market for GHG emissions on the basis of grandfathered quotas
or of quotas delivered in function of voluntary agreements of
sectors to given emissions targets (see Chapter 6). This option
does not generate revenue, but (contrary to tax exemptions)
implies participation of the carbon-intensive industry to climate
policy and does not transfer the full burden to households and
the rest of industry. However, the welfare impacts are systemat-
ically found to be less favourable than under a full revenue-neu-
tral taxation. Jensen (1998) found a welfare loss of 1.4% in
Denmark and a permit price of US$110/tCO,, while a uniform
tax to meet the same —20% target is only US$40 and the resul-
tant welfare loss is 1.2%. Bye and Nyborg (1999) investigated
the effects on welfare (total discounted utility) of both uniform
taxes and tradable permits issued freely compared to the current
system of tax exemptions. To keep total tax revenues unchanged
for the government, the payroll tax is adjusted accordingly. They
found that a permit system gives a welfare loss of 0.03% com-
pared to the current system, while with uniform taxes there is a
gain of similar size. The main reason is that payroll taxes must
increase to maintain the budget balance when carbon taxes are
not used. There are similar findings for the USA. Parry et al.
(1999) show that the net economic impact (after accounting for
environmental benefits but not without climate benefits) of car-
bon abatement is positive when permits are auctioned, but
switches to negative when permits are grandfathered.

"International competition limits the ability of firms to pass the
tax onto prices, thus reducing the size of the indirect distribu-
tional effect. In the same way, the degree of production factor
substitution determines the extent to which the tax changes
prices. Moreover, as the substitution is generally supposed to
be limited in the short term, but increasing as existing plants
are replaced, the distributional effect of an environmental tax
changes over time. Last, but not least, the distributional effect
depends basically on the utilization of the tax revenue.

"However, at this stage insufficient evidence exists either to
confirm or to substantiate these results in the context of devel-

rigorous, their conclusions may not be directly transferable. It
can be argued that, in developing countries, direct welfare loss-
es typically associated with specific factor taxes (such as a car-
bon tax) may have fewer opportunities for mitigation within
the fiscal-reform policy envelope. Nevertheless, the complex
linkages between formal and informal sectors of the economy
may show this intuition to be incorrect; the only existing study
for China reviewed here suggests that this may be the case but
further research is needed to confirm this more generally.

"Two British studies looked at distributional effects of climate
policies. Barker and Johnstone (1993) investigated the distrib-
utional effects of a carbon—energy tax. Revenues are recycled
through an energy efficiency programme and compared to
lump-sum transfers. The results show that the burden of a car-
bon-energy tax falls most heavily on low-income groups. At
the same time, for these low-income groups the potential gains
to be realized by increasing energy efficiency are higher to off-
set this regressive outcome. Symons et al. (1994) investigated
other various assumptions of revenue recycling for the UK, and
found that to introduce a carbon tax without recycling or with
recycling through VAT or petrol excise-duty reductions is sig-
nificantly regressive. Conversely, recycling the carbon tax by a
combination of VAT rate reductions and benefits reforms
directed towards poorer households results in favourable dis-
tributive effects.

"An evaluation of the distributional incidence of higher energy
prices is significantly conditional upon the indicator used.
Distributional impacts appear to be higher when additional
costs are measured in terms of percentage of total household
expenditures rather than income, and higher if current income
is considered instead of lifetime income. Lifetime income is
relevant in the sense that households can borrow or save, and
also move between different income classes. According to
Poterba (1991), a person had only a 41% chance of being in the
same quintile of income distribution in 1971 and in 1978. This
percentage rises to 54% if the person initially belongs to the
poorest quintile. However, current income is relevant to stud-
ies on the short-term intergeneration impact of a new tax. For
example, an elderly person is more adversely affected by new
taxes on expenditures than are those on an income, even if sub-
sequent generations pay the same lifetime tax bill under each
factor influencing the macroeconomy.

"The costs of meeting the Kyoto targets are very sensitive to the
type of recycling used for the revenue of carbon taxes or auc-
tioned permits. In general, however, modelling results show that
the sum of the positive revenue-recycling effect and the negative
tax-interaction effect of a carbon tax or auctioned emission per-
mits is roughly zero. Thus, in some analyses the sum is positive,
while in others it is negative. In economies with an especially
distortive tax system (as in several European analyses), the sum
may be positive and hence confirm the strong double-dividend
hypothesis. In economies with fewer distortions, such as in var-
ious models of the US economy, the sum is negative. Another
conclusion is that even with no strong double-dividend effect, a
country fares considerably better with a revenue-recycling poli-
cy than with one that is not revenue recycling, like grandfa-
thered quotas. Analyses of the US economy found that revenue
recycling reduces the cost of regulation by about 30%-50% for
a certain range of targets, while European analyses report cost
savings that are even higher than 100%.

"involves a relatively small efficiency cost for the economy.
This arises because CO, abatement policies have the potential
to generate revenues that are very large relative to the potential
loss of profit for these industries. By enabling firms to retain
only a very small fraction of these potential revenues, the gov-
ernment can protect the firms’ profit and equity values. Thus,
the government needs to grandfather only a small percentage
of CO, emissions permits or, similarly, must exempt only a
small fraction of emissions from the base of a carbon tax. This
policy involves a small sacrifice of potential government rev-
enue. Such revenue has an efficiency value because it can
finance cuts in pre-existing distortionary taxes. These authors
also found a very large difference between preserving firms’
profits and preserving their tax payments. Offsetting produc-
ers’ carbon tax payments on a dollar-for-dollar basis (through
cuts in corporate tax rates, for example) substantially over-
compensates firms, raising their profit and equity values sig-
nificantly relative to the situation prior to the environmental
regulation. This reflects that producers shift onto consumers
most of the burden from a carbon tax. The efficiency costs of
such policies are far greater than the costs of policies that do
not overcompensate firms.

and Vennemo (1994) concluded that a global carbon tax of
US$325/tC in 2000 and US$700/tC in 2025 (1987 prices) has
no significant impact on the regional distribution of welfare.
For Australia, Cornwell and Creedy (1996) found that a carbon
tax only affecting households (the input-output matrix is con-
stant in their model) is clearly regressive, but can become neu-
tral if adequate recycling is implemented. In addition, the dis-
tributional differences across income are not affected much.
On the other hand, Aasness ef al. (1996) conclude for the same
country that poor households are less favourably affected than
rich households, because of smaller budget shares on consumer
goods (which imply relatively more CO, emissions) in the rich
households. Harrison and Kristrém (1999) studied the general
equilibrium effects of a scenario in Sweden in which the exist-
ing carbon taxes increase by 100% and labour taxes are
reduced to maintain constant governmental revenue, but with-
out removing the existing exemptions from carbon taxes. All
households lose from this carbon tax (with tax exemptions)
increase. They point out that the distributional effects are very
dependent on the size of the household (the more affected
being those with children). In a study for 11 EU member states,
Barker and Kohler (1998) examined emission reductions of

"2.4.1 The Evaluation of the Ancillary Public Health
Impacts
"	Title
"The section reviews some of the recent studies estimating
ancillary benefits of GHG mitigation policies. The studies are
briefly described and examined for the credibility of their
methods and estimates.
"	Text
"The Burtraw et al. (1999) review of US ancillary benefit stud-
ies of public health impacts linked to mitigation policies
applied to the electricity sector came to several important con-
clusions:
"	Text
"Figure 8.9 summarizes the ancillary benefits per tonne of car-
bon from 15 studies, along with available confidence intervals
around the mid estimate. Multiple entries for a study on the
Figure result from modelling of multiple policy scenarios.
Most of the studies focus solely on public health impacts.
"	Text
"ric equals more than one then the carbon policy modelled has
net private benefits even without counting the direct climate
benefits. If (average) ancillary benefits are lower than private
marginal costs no claim for net benefits can be made. However,
the lower the fraction, the less likely the policy will have net
benefits.
"	Text
"Studies estimating ancillary public health impacts from climate
policies were examined, relying on three surveys of this litera-
ture (Ekins, 1996; Burtraw eft al., 1999; Kverndokk and
Rosendahl, 2000) and on summaries of the older literature,
supplemented by some of the newer studies. Table 8.5 provides
a description of each study, as well as the estimates of ancillary
benefits per tonne of carbon. Table 8.6 summarizes the model-
ling choices of the studies reviewed.
"	Text
" 

Estimates from early studies of ancillary benefits tend-
ed to exceed later ones because of the former’s use of
more crude and less disaggregate modelling.

Studies that did not factor into the baseline the reduc-
tions in conventional pollutants required under the
1990 Clean Air Act estimated benefits an order of mag-
nitude larger than the studies that did include the 1990
Clean Air Act in the baseline. Analyzing Ekins (1996),
Burtraw et al. (1999) found that whether the Second
Sulphur Protocol is added to the baseline or not can
alter the estimate of ancillary benefit by over 30%.
"	List
"A few important caveats are, however, in order. The most
important is that the relevant cost measure in the above fraction
is social not private cost. In this case, marginal social costs are
likely to exceed marginal private costs because of tax interac-
tion effects. Thus, ancillary benefits may not exceed social
marginal cost even if the former exceeds private marginal cost
(equal to the carbon tax). Second, ancillary benefit (cost) mea-
sures need to measure social welfare gains (or losses) if they
are to be comparable to losses on the mitigation side. But,
many measures of ancillary benefits understate social welfare
gains and other benefits remain unmonetized or even unquan-
tified, while in other cases, the ancillary benefits overstate wel-
fare gains (say by counting all traffic fatality reductions as
external benefits). Thus, reported ancillary benefits can under-
or overstate actual ancillary benefits. If this indicator is greater
than one, then the carbon policy has net private benefits even
without counting the direct climate benefits.
"	Text
"Kverndokk and Rosendahl (2000) review much of the recent
ancillary benefit literature in the Nordic countries, UK, and
Ireland, concluding that benefits are of the same order of mag-
nitude as gross (i.e., private) mitigation costs. They also con-
clude that the benefits should be viewed as highly uncertain,
because of the use of simplistic tools and transfers of
dose-response and valuation functions from studies done in
other countries. They point out that most of the Norwegian
studies use expert judgement instead of established
dose-response functions and estimates of national damages per
tonne rather than distinguishing where emissions changes
occur and exposures are reduced. Also, they point out that large
differences in ancillary benefits per tonne across several
Norwegian studies can be attributed to differences in energy
demand and energy substitution elasticities. If energy produc-
tion is reduced rather than switched to less carbon-intensive
fuels, ancillary benefits will be far larger. Kverndokk and
Rosendahl (2000) point out also that studies that feed environ-
mental benefits back into the economic model add significant-
ly to ancillary benefits.
"	Text
"Some studies did not consider the “bounceback” effect
(i.e., the offsetting increase in conventional pollutants)
when a less carbon-intensive technology is substituted
for a more intensive one in response to a carbon miti-
gation policy.

Ancillary benefit estimates are very sensitive to
assumptions about the mortality risk coefficient and the
value of statistical life (VSL). Routine values used in
the literature can lead to a difference of 300% in ancil-
lary benefit estimates.

Burtraw et al. (1999) and earlier studies to reconcile US
and European estimates for the social costs of fuel
cycles found that population density differences
between Europe and the USA account for 2 to 3 times
larger benefit estimates in Europe. Also, the fact that
much East Coast US pollution is blown out to sea while
European pollution is blown inland can account for
large ancillary benefit differences.

With a cap on SO, emissions, abatement cost savings
are considered ancillary benefits of a carbon policy
unless the reductions are so large that the cap becomes
non-binding. When this happens, with SO, effects on
mortality being as large as they appear to be, ancillary
benefits increase in a discontinuous and rapid fashion,
as the health benefits begin to be counted.

"The report included a sensitivity analysis of the range of deaths, predicting that by 2020, 700,000 avoidable deaths (90% Confidence
Interval, 385,000—1,034,000) will occur annually as a result of additional particulate matter (PM) exposure under the baseline fore-
casts when compared with the climate policy scenario. From 2000 to 2020, the cumulative impact on public health related to the dif-
ference in PM exposure could reach 8 million deaths globally (90% CI, 4.4—11.9 million). In the USA alone, the number of annual
deaths from PM exposure in 2020 (without control policy) would equal in magnitude deaths associated with human immunodeficien-
cy diseases or all liver diseases in 1995. “The mortality estimates are indicative of the magnitude of the potential health benefits of
the climate-policy scenario examined and are not precise predictions of avoidable deaths. While characterized by considerable uncer-
tainty, the short-term public-health impacts of reduced PM exposure associated with greenhouse-gas reductions are likely to be sub-
stantial even under the most conservative set of assumptions.”
"	Text
"It is useful to estimate ancillary benefits through quantitative indicators, even if they are not monetized (Pearce, 2000). One such glob-
al scale effort was produced by the WHO/WRI/EPA Working Group on Public Health and Fossil Fuel Combustion on the range of
avoidable deaths that could arise between 2000 and 2020 under current policies, and under the scenario proposed by the EU in 1995.
This EU Scenario assumed that by 2010 GHG emissions would be 15% below 1990 levels for Annex I countries, and 10% below pro-
jected emissions for 2010 for non-Annex I countries (Davis, 1997; Working Group on Public Health and Fossil Fuel Combustion,
1997). The total change in carbon emissions was estimated globally, based on a source-receptor matrix for four specific sectors (indus-
try, transport, household, and energy) that was adjusted for local temperature and humidity. Applied to nine regions and adjusted for
temperature and humidity, this matrix yielded changes in projected fuel types and formed the basis for calculating total emissions of
particulates. Mortality tied with particulates was calculated based on best estimates (Borja-Aburto ef al., 1997, 1998; Pereira et al.,
1998; Gold et al., 1999; Braga et al., 1999; Linn et al., 2000).

"In the general case, a larger carbon tax should lead to progres-
sively smaller carbon reductions (if the marginal abatement
cost curve is upward sloping). For all but one study (Abt
Associates and Pechan-Avanti Group, 1999), the ratio of ancil-
lary benefits to the tax rate does fall. As for the change in ancil-
lary benefits per tonne of carbon, Burtraw et al. (1999) show
this ratio falling dramatically in percentage terms with higher
carbon taxes. In contrast, Dessus and O’Connor (1999) show it
"	Text
"rising slightly, and in the Abt study the ratio of benefits to the
tax rate rises dramatically (Abt Associates and Pechan-Avanti
Group, 1999). This last result reflects that this analysis treated
the SO, cap as non-binding considerably below the higher tax-
rate modelled. In addition, this study treated the National
Ambient Air Quality Standards as a cap, with abatement below
these “caps” treated as benefits, but reductions above these
caps treated as saving abatement costs.
"	Text
"Almost all the studies analyze the effects of a GHG reduction
policy through a tax on carbon. The ranges of the tax are from
modest levels (RMB Y9/tC’) in 2010 for Garbaccio et al.
(2000), US$10/tC for Burtraw et al. (1999); up to high levels
(US$254/tC for Dessus and O’Connor (1999), and US$840/tC
for Brendemoen and Vennemo (1994). The US studies employ
relatively modest taxes, between US$10/tC and US$67/tC.
Only two studies consider alternative programmes: Aunan et
al. (2000) considers a National Efficiency Programme, and
Cifuentes et al. (2000) considers energy efficiency improve-
ments. The level of abatement considered by these two studies
is relatively modest, however.
"	Text
"Figure 8.10 provides ancillary benefits per tonne estimates
related to the size of the carbon tax (in 1996 US$/tC). Points on
the diagonal line AB = MC indicate that marginal private mit-
igation costs (MC) equate to the tax. Some points fall on this
line; more appear above it than below, with the
Norwegian/Western Europe and the US studies split. If the
damage (benefit) function is linear, then average benefits
equate marginal benefits. Thus, points on the diagonal imply
that the carbon tax is “quasi-optimal” (Dessus and O’Connor,
1999), in that the tax is optimal without considering either the
direct climate mitigation benefits or any social costs over pri-
vate costs (such as deadweight losses from the tax interaction
effect). Alternatively, it can be assumed that the private miti-
gation cost function is quadratic (Total Cost=b(X?)), where X
is carbon reduction. In this case, the tax rate equals marginal
private mitigation cost and average private mitigation cost is
half marginal private mitigation cost. The heavy diagonal line
equates ancillary benefits to average private mitigation cost.
Points above this line imply there are net benefits to carbon
policy, with the same important caveats as above. More points
appear above the corresponding line (AB=AC) on the graph
than above the AB=MC line.

Three recent studies (Hagler- Bailly 1995; Lee et al., 1995;
European Commission, 1999) developed methods that set the
stage for much of the recent estimates of ancillary benefits.
However, studies that draw on this literature, but reduce its
information to coefficients that link emissions directly to
health effects (or values) ignore spatial and demographic het-
erogeneity. This is particularly so when such coefficients are
generated for one country or region and then directly applied to
another, without taking into account local conditions. In the
absence of country-specific information, transfer of risk infor-
mation may be made between countries, with appropriate
caveats to take into account underlying differences in health
status, access to care, and other important factors (see Box 8.2).

All the studies in Table 8.5 account for the most important pol-
lutant affecting public health — particulates. Most, however, do
not consider secondary particulate formation from SO, and
NO,, or do so in a very simplistic manner. In a developing
country, direct particulate emissions are likely to be a large
fraction of particulate mass, making the lack of attention to
secondary products less important. In developed countries,
however, secondary products are likely to be far more impor-
tant than primary particulates. Omitting these products could
bias ancillary benefit estimates downwards; using proportion-
ality assumptions or other simple approaches raises uncertain-
ties and may carry biases. Only one study considered lead
emissions (Dessus and O’Connoer, 1999); few address ozone.

"The importance of the baseline is evident in a review of previ-
ous studies for the USA in Burtraw et al. (1999). Assessments
varied in their estimates of ancillary benefits, chiefly because
they employed different assumptions regarding the regulatory
baselines, that is the 1990 US Clean Air Act Amendments and,
especially, the tradable permit programme for SO, Among
these baseline parameters, the most critical are the spatial loca-
tion of emissions relevant to potentially exposed populations,
regulatory conditions, and available technologies
(Morgenstern, 2000). The importance of the location of emis-
sion reductions and exposed populations means that highly dis-
aggregated models are the preferred tools of analysis. This may
conflict with other goals for the analysis of GHG mitigation
strategies. For example, large CGE models, which are used for
cost estimation, operate at a different scale than the more local-
ized models relevant to estimating ancillary benefits.
"	Text
" 

Most of the studies in Table 8.5 use static or dynamic CGE
models (one uses an econometric model) that provide T-D and
sectorally aggregate estimates of ancillary benefits and/or
costs. The Burtraw ef al. (1999) model stands out for the loca-
tion specificity of its economic model (although only for the
electricity sector), which permits more credible modelling of
population exposure reductions than that from spatially aggre-
gate models. Another specific feature is its detailed represen-
tation of investment choices and their dependence on other
factors covered in the model. Finally, several studies do not
use an economic model. Instead, they follow a B-U approach,
positing some increase in energy efficiency or reduction in
carbon and estimating the ancillary benefits that would result,
at a reasonably detailed spatial level. Such studies suffer from
not accounting for behavioural adjustments, such as energy
substitutions, which could alter their estimates of ancillary
benefits considerably. The high ratio of ancillary benefits to
the carbon tax for Garbaccio et al. (1999) appears to arise from
very optimistic assumptions about energy substitution elastic-
ities.

(notably infectious diseases) predominated in those who survive to reach these age groups (Cropper er al., 1997). However, people
between 15 and 45 years of age are at increased risk of death from air pollution relative to those in developed countries. Since the pop-

measured in terms of years of life lost is similar to that of a developed country.

"All the studies, except those in the USA, assume that improve-

ancillary benefits. As noted in Krupnick ef al. (2000), this
assumption may not always hold. Burtraw et al. (1999) and Abt
Associates and Pechan-Avanti Group (1999) count the abate-
ment cost savings from reducing SO, emissions in response to
a carbon tax because SO, emissions are capped in the USA.
Similar adjustments are not made for SO, and other pollutant
taxation in Europe. Moreover, not all ancillary benefits are nec-
essarily externalities. In some cases, these effects may be
already “internalized” in the price of goods and services: for
example, where accident insurance against road fatalities
exists, much of this effect is already accounted for through pur-
chasing insurance and the penalties for failure to obtain it.

The issue is whether the models were designed to capture
ancillary costs. In general, our conclusion is no, except for fos-
sil fuel substitution in the power and transport sectors. From an
energy substitution perspective, substitution to nuclear power
or hydropower does not generate reported ancillary costs
because these ancillary effects are not present in the studies.
Other sources of ancillary costs were also left out of the mod-
elling exercise, either because of model boundaries or through
making some standard modelling choices. All the studies
examined effects on one country or region, and therefore do
not consider the leakage effect. None of the studies considered

"In the case of Chile, Dessus and O’Connor (1999) estimate
benefits of about US$250/tC, as compared to US$62/tC in
Cifuentes et al. (2000). Half of the Dessus and O’Connor
(1999) benefits are attributable to effects on intelligence quo-
tient (IQ) associated with reduced lead exposure, an endpoint
not considered by Cifuentes et al. (2000) and by most studies.
The large lead—IQ effect seems to be at variance with US and
European studies that consider this and more conventional end-
points. Also, the VSL used by Dessus and O’Connor (1999) is
more than twice as large as that used by Cifuentes et al. (2000;
US$2.1 million versus US$0.78 million by the year 2020).
These choices were driven by alternative benefit transfer
approaches: Dessus and O’Connor (1999) used 1992 purchas-
ing power parity to transfer a mid estimate of US VSL, while
Cifuentes et al. (2000) used 1995 per capita income differences
and the exchange rate to transfer a lower bound US VSL. This
comparison illustrates that the choice of benefit transfer

approach was implicitly adopted and the focus of analysis was
placed on linkages between emissions trading regimes and
national policies. Contrary to the preceding period, very few
works were devoted to the case of co-ordinated carbon taxes.
Hourcade et al., (2000a) confirmed that, because of the exist-
ing uneven distribution of income, discrepancies in pre-exist-
ing taxation levels, and differences in national energy and car-
bon intensities, a uniform carbon tax would result in very dif-
ferentiated losses in welfare across countries, unless appropri-
ate compensation transfers operated. However, a differentiated
taxation does not minimize total abatement expenditures (rich
countries would have to tap more expensive abatement poten-
tials) and creates distortions in international competition. The
suggested solution, a uniform tax for carbon-intensive industry
exposed to international competition and a differentiated taxa-
tion for households, has to be at least adapted to the Kyoto
framework which does not preclude the use of carbon taxes but
changes the condition of their applicability. However, the
underlying issue of how to minimize abatement expenditures
while guaranteeing a fair distribution of welfare costs still
remains.

"For all these reasons, it remains very challenging to arrive at
quantitative estimates of the ancillary benefits of GHG mitiga-
tion policies. Despite the difficulties, it can be said that the
ancillary benefits related to public health accrue over the short
term, and under some circumstances can be a significant frac-
tion of private (direct) mitigation costs. With respect to this cat-
egory of impacts alone mortality tends to dominate. The exact
magnitude, scale, and scope of these ancillary benefits varies
with local geographical and baseline conditions; if the baseline
scenario assumes a rapid decrease in non-GHG pollutant emis-
sions, benefits may be low, especially in low density areas. Net
ancillary costs (i.e., where the ancillary benefits are less than
ancillary costs) may occur under certain conditions, but the
models reviewed here are generally not designed to capture
these effects. While most of the studies assessed above address
ancillary benefits of explicit climate mitigation measures, it
should be noted that in many cases, these ancillary benefits can
be expected to be as least as important as climate mitigation for
decision making. Hence, the terms co-benefits is also used in
this report. Therefore, there is a strong need for more research
in the area of integrated policies addressing climate mitigation
alongside other environmental, social or economic objectives.

"marginal abatement cost as the optimal level). However, Pizer
(1997), building on a seminal work by Weitzman (1974),
demonstrated that this is not the case if uncertainties about cli-
mate damages and GHG abatement costs are considered.
Indeed, welfare losses due to an error of anticipation are not the
same in these two approaches, depending upon whether the
steepness of marginal abatement cost curve is higher or lower
than the steepness of the damage curve. If the marginal abate-
ment cost curve is steeper, then it is preferable to agree on a
pre-determined level of taxation because if this level is either
too low or too high, the resulting welfare losses trough climate
impacts will not be dramatic. This is the case in most model-
ling efforts as long as there is no large probability of dramatic
non-linearity in climate systems over the middle term. This
policy conclusion can be reverted if one considers a high level
of risk-aversion to catastrophic events (which makes the dam-
age curve steeper), or a large proportion of “no regret” policies
(which make the mitigation cost curve flatter). The main mes-
sage, however, is that in a tax harmonization approach, the
costs of complying with commitments on climate policies are
known in advance (but the outcome is not predictable), while
in a quota approach the outcome is observable but there is an
uncertainty about the resultant costs. In this respect, emissions
trading is logically a companion tool to a system of emissions
quotas, to hedge against the distributional implications of sur-
prises regarding abatement costs and emissions baselines.

because it accounts for near-term shocks, such as inflationary impacts
of higher energy prices (requiring higher interest rates, which dampen
the investment), and for a 5-year delay in the response of agents). The
EIA estimates rise to 4.2% when the non-CO, gases and carbon sinks
are excluded from the analysis.

"In terms of GDP losses, the ranking of impacts differs because
of the various pre-existing structures of the economy and of the
energy supply and demand in various countries and because
these studies do not consider the domestic policies targeted to
tackle these pre-exisiting conditions; the GDP losses are from
0.45% to 1.96% for the USA, from 0.31 to 2.08 for the EU,
from 0.25 to 1.88 for Japan. This variation is reduced under
emissions trading; 0.31 to 1.03 for the USA, 0.13 to 0.73 for
the OECD-Europe, from 0.05 to 0. 52 for Japan.

"This discrepancy in results reflects differences in judgements
about parameters such as technical potentials, emissions base-
lines, how the revenues of permits are recycled, and how near-
term shocks are represented. Another important source of uncer-
tainty is the feedback of the carbon constraint on the demand for
oil; a drop in oil prices requires indeed higher prices of carbon
to meet a given target since the signals not conveyed by oil

Worldscan, trading offers the potential for countries with high

8.8 assume non-restricted trade within Annex I and ideal CDM
implementation that can exploit all cost effective options in
developing countries with unlimited trading. Beyond the fact
that the price of carbon is drastically reduced, it is remarkable
that the variance of results is far lower than in the no-trade sce-
narios (between US$15/tC and US$86/tC). Uncertainty about
costs persists, but this lesser variance arises because uncertain-
ty is higher on each regional cost curve than on the aggregation
of the same regional cost curves, which is exploited in the case
of full trading.

"In the case of Annex I trading (without considering the CDM)
the price of permits ranges from US$20 to US$224/tC instead
of US$15 to US$86/tC in the full trade case, which represents
a far greater variance. This is mainly from the amount of so
called “hot air”!* retained in simulations. Some countries in
Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union have had a
decline in emissions in the 1990s, resulting from the economic
dislocations associated with restructuring. As a result, their
emissions during the first commitment period are projected to
be lower than their negotiated target. If trading is allowed with-
in Annex I, these excess emissions quota may be sold to coun-
tries in need of such credits. Hence, the assumption regarding
the availability of “hot air” is important. This, of course, will
be governed in part by the rate of economic recovery, but also
by the role of energy efficiency improvements and fuel switch-
ing during the restructuring process.

"From the above results, it is seen that all OECD countries have
an interest in making the market as large as possible. Some
Parties to the UNFCCC, however, have suggested that the sup-
plementarity conditions of Articles 6.1.d, 12 and 17 of the
Kyoto Protocol be translated into quantitative limits placed on
the extent that Annex I countries can satisfy their obligations
through the purchase of emission quotas. The rationale for the
supplementarity condition is that, if the price of permits were
too low, this would discourage domestic action on structural
variables (infrastructure, transportation) or on innovation apt to
modify the emissions trends over the long run. These measures
are very often liable to high transaction costs and governments
may prefer to import additional emissions permits instead of
adopting such measures. In other words, minimization of the
costs of achieving Kyoto targets may not guarantee minimiza-
tion of the costs of climate policies over the long run; this is the
case when the inertia of technical systems is considered (Ha-
Duong et al., 1999) and when one accounts for the long term
benefits of inducing technical change through abatements in
the first period (Glueck and Schleicher, 1995).

Unger and Alm (1999) for the same plus Finland) show the
considerable value of trading electricity and GHG permits

Another MARKAL study computes the net savings of trading
GHG permits between Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, and
the Netherlands (Bahn ef al., 1998) at about 15% of the total
Kyoto cost without trading. Another study (Bahn ef al., 1999a)
shows that Switzerland’s Kyoto cost may be reduced drastical-

the marginal cost of CO, drops to US$12/C. This type of B-U

"ket, and most of the additional burden will fall on countries in
which the marginal cost curve is high because they have a less-
er potential for cheap abatement. This is typically the case for
Japan and most of the European countries (Hourcade et al.,
2000b). The other possibility is for the market power to be con-
trolled by the carbon-importing countries; in this case, the risk
is that all or most of the trading will be of “hot air” at a very
low price. Which of these alternatives will be realized cannot
be predicted but, in both cases, quantitative limits to trade lead
to outcomes that contradict the very objective of the supple-
mentarity condition. Criqui et al. (1999) assessed the order of
magnitude at stake with the POLES model, and examined a
scenario in which the carbon tax is US$60/tC with unrestricted
trade. They found that the carbon prices under the concrete
ceiling conditions proposed by the EU fall to zero (with no
market left for the developing countries) if the market power is
held by the buyers. Alternatively, the carbon prices increase up
to US$150/tC if the market power is held by the sellers, this
risk being increased in the case of caps on hot air trading which
increases the monopolistic power of Russia and Ukraine.
Bohringer (2000) assesses the economic implications of the
EU cap proposal within competitive permit markets. He con-
cludes that part of the efficiency gains from unrestricted permit
trade could be used to pay for higher abatement targets of
Annex-B countries which assure the same environmental
effectiveness as compared to restricted permit trade but still
leaves countries better off in welfare terms.

emissions constraint comes to increasing the cost of carbon-
intensive products and, if emissions arise from the production
of its export goods, the abating economy benefits from better
terms of trade. If, indeed, the importing economy cannot pro-
duce a perfect substitute easily, it will sell the same product at
a higher price and increase its purchasing power of imported
goods. The non-abating economy will symmetrically suffer a
welfare loss because of more expensive imports, while the net
result for the abating economy depends on the size of improve-
ment in the terms of trade relative to the production costs of
abatement. The welfare impacts are more important in the
economies that are very dependent on foreign trade.
"	Text
"In the real world, an emission constraint simultaneously affects
both export and import goods, but this does change the nature
of the mechanism. Increased production of emission-intensive
goods in non-Annex I regions is stimulated by both increased
non-Annex I consumption and increased exports to Annex I
regions. The net relative balance between these parameters is
influenced by the extent to which Annex I emission constraints
fall on export competing industries (when the country is spe-
cialized in such industries) as opposed to import-competing
industries (when it imports carbon intensive goods). If a con-
straint predominantly affects export industries, it encourages
increased non-Annex I production for internal consumption. If
the constraint predominantly affects import-competing indus-
tries, increased non-Annex I production is mainly exported to
Annex I regions. Emissions leakage is beneficial to non-Annex
I economies only in the second case, since it is associated with
an improvement in their terms of trade, whereas their terms of
trade deteriorate in the first case.

would result in welfare losses for most non-Annex I regions

"So far, it was assumed that changes in the production structures
in both Annex I and Non-Annex I countries result only in
changes in final demand and in price structures. The introduc-

since, in addition to production costs and changes in the terms
of trade, carbon constraints alter the relative rates of return in
the abating and non-abating countries. If capital flows from the
first country to the second in response to these changes, there
will be a further restriction of the production frontier (the set of
possible productive combinations) for the abating economy
and an outward shift for the other economy. Factor rewards in
both countries are also affected. Part of the income from for-
eign investment accrues to the home economy and subtracts
from income in the foreign economy; abating economies are
affected by changes in income and factor prices that result from
changes in international capital flows, with symmetric gains
for non-abating economies.

gains in welfare under the Kyoto targets: the changing balance
between substitution and output reduction with the level of
abatement. GDP losses or the required level of a carbon tax for
Annex I regions are, indeed, an increasing function of the level
of abatement and the milder Kyoto targets are expected to be
achieved with a greater reliance on substitution relative to out-

"To summarize, despite a number of identifiable numerical dis-

and losses under the Kyoto targets results in a more positive
aggregate outcome than under the assumed and more stringent

as gainers and losers are also quite marked. Oil-importing
economies that rely on energy-intensive exports are gainers
(and more so if the exports’ carbon intensity is low), economies
that rely on oil exports experience losses, and the results are
more unstable for economies between these two extremes.

"One of the most important conclusions is that a number of
those among non-Annex I regions that experienced a welfare
loss under the pre-Kyoto targets experience a welfare gain
under the Kyoto targets. For example, in the GREEN model,
India and the Dynamic Asian Economies experienced a loss in
real income in the pre-Kyoto simulation (Coppel and Lee,
1995). They experience a mild gain in real income under sim-
ulations of the Kyoto Protocol that involve varying degrees of
policy co-ordination among the non-Annex | regions (van der
Mensbrugghe, 1998). In pre-Kyoto simulations of the GTEM
model (Brown ef al., 1997b; Donovan et al., 1997), Chinese
Taipei, India, Brazil, and the Rest of America were all found to
experience welfare losses; with Kyoto targets (Tulpulé er al.,

"aggregation, it is difficult to give a comprehensive list of
exceptions. The reasons for these exceptions are, however,
easy to explain. Brazil and South Korea are, in many models,
found to enjoy welfare gains from Annex I abatement policies
because, unlike other non-Annex I regions, they are net
importers of fossil fuels and have a high relative dependence
on exports of iron and steel and non-ferrous metal products. In
addition, in Brazil these products are far less intensive in fossil
energy than in many other economies.!° Brazil gains from
lower prices for fossil fuel imports and higher prices for
exports of iron and steel and non-ferrous metal products.
Conversely, non-Annex I regions with the greatest dependence
on fossil fuel exports, such as the Middle East and Indonesia,
suffer the greatest deterioration. Non-Annex I regions that are
net importers of manufacture goods that are fossil-fuel inten-
sive also suffer a deterioration even if they benefit from lower
oil prices.
"	Text
"Why are overall welfare losses to non-Annex I regions reduced
by emissions trading? A key point is that because the marginal
and average cost of abatement for the aggregate Annex | is
lower under emissions trading than under uniform abatement,
a higher GDP is achieved for a given reduction in emissions.
This means that the reduction in emissions is achieved through
a heavier reliance on substitution relative to output reduction
(substitution involves the substitution of less emission-inten-
sive for more emission-intensive Annex I produced inputs).
The heavier reliance on substitution means that there is a less
severe decline in fossil fuel prices and a lower increase in the
price of manufactured goods that are fossil-fuel intensive.
There is also less increase in non-Annex | exports of fossil-fuel
intensive manufactured goods to Annex I regions under emis-
sions trading than independent abatement. However, these
increased exports divert resources from activities in which the
original non-Annex | comparative advantage was higher and
the overall result is less beneficial to most non-Annex I
economies.

“fringe” oil producers and other fossil fuel sources. A scenario
is examined in which a carbon tax is maintained at a level of
US$10 per barrel of oil. Initially, OPEC cuts back on produc-
tion to try to maintain price, but this is partly offset by
increased production by the fringe. Braten and Golombek

high variance in estimates of emission leakage rates was noted;
they ranged from close to zero (Martin et al. (1992) using the
GREEN model) to 70% (Pezzey (1992) using the
Whalley—Wigle model). In subsequent years, some reduction
in this variance has occurred, in the range 5%—20%. This may
in part arise from the development of a number of new models
based on reasonably similar assumptions and data sources, and
does not necessarily reflect more widespread agreement about
appropriate behavioural assumptions. However, because emis-
sion leakage is an increasing function of the stringency of the
abatement strategy, this may also be because carbon leakage is
a less serious problem under the Kyoto targets than under the
targets considered previously.

"A number of theoretical papers examined how a carbon tax
might alter the optimal timing of extraction of given reserves
of oil and, symmetrically, how significantly the potential sup-
ply response could alter the optimal time path of the price of
carbon tax (Sinclair, 1992; Ulph and Ulph, 1994; Farzin and
Tahovonen, 1996; Hoel and Kverndokk, 1996; Tahvonen,
1997). However, the severity of the potential problem depends
on a number of key parameter values and implementation
issues. Although it has been assumed that OPEC can “Granger
cause” the world price of oil (Giillen, 1996), there is some
question about the degree of cartel discipline that could be
maintained in the face of falling demand (Berg et al., 1997a).
Any breakdown in the cartel would tend to increase the supply
of oil on the market, which in the short term may require a
higher carbon tax to meet a given abatement target. On the
other hand, Braéten and Golombek (1998) suggest that imple-
menting an Annex I climate change agreement might be seen
by OPEC members as a hostile act and could strengthen the
resolve to maintain cartel discipline. The OPEC response is
likely to be related to the size of its potential loss in revenue to
OPEC and these potential losses would be smaller under
Annex I emissions trading than under independent abatement.

domestic production are imperfect substitutes produces
lower estimates of emission leakage than models based
on the assumption of perfect substitutability.

The ease of substitution among technologies with dif-
ferent emissions intensities in the electricity and the
iron and steel industries in Annex I regions.

The assumed degree of competitiveness in the world oil
market; this issue is considered in Section 8.3.2.3.

The existence of an international carbon-trading sys-
tem: for a given abatement strategy, emission leakage is
lower under emissions trading than under independent
abatement. This conclusion flows logically from the
discussion above on movements in terms of trade.
Greater Annex I output reduction under independent
abatement stimulates greater emission-intensive pro-
duction in non-Annex I regions, through both higher
prices for emission intensive products and lower prices
for fossil fuels. Support for the above conclusions on
the impact of emissions trading is found in ABARE-
DFAT (1995), Brown et al. (1997b), Hinchy et al.
(1998), Brown et al. (1999), McKibbin et al. (1999),
Kainuma et al. (1999), and Bernstein et al. (1999).

"One potentially important related issue not captured in the
above models is that cleaner technologies, developed in
response to abatement measures in industrialized countries,
tend to diffuse internationally. The question is to what extent
this will offset the negative aspects of leakage noted above and
to amplify positive spillover. Grubb (2000) presents a simpli-
fied model, which represents this spillover effect in terms of its
impact on emissions per unit GDP (intensities). The results
suggest that, because the impact of cleaner technologies is
cumulative and global, this effect tends to dominate over time,
provided the connection between industrialized and developing
country emission intensities is significant (higher than 0.1 on a
scale where 0 represents an absence of connection and | a
complete convergence of intensities by 2100). At this stage,
empirical analysis is still lacking to derive a robust conclusion
from this result. A recent work by Mielnik and Goldemberg
(2000) suggests that the potential for technological leap-frog-
ging in developing countries is important, but to what extent
climate mitigation in Annex B accelerates this leap-frogging is
still unclear. However, this demonstrates that the trickling
down of technical change across countries deserves more
attention in modelling exercises, all the more so since theoret-
ically it (see Chapter 10 of this report) demonstrates that tech-
nological spillovers may be a major stabilizing force of any cli-
mate coalition.

does not identify the least-cost mitigation pathway, however.
This was done in the subsequent EMF (1997) study. The results
are presented in Figure 8.14. In these studies the least-cost mit-

"The choice of emission pathways can be thought of as a carbon
budget allocation problem. To a first approximation, a concen-
tration target defines an allowable amount of carbon to be emit-
ted into the atmosphere between now and some date in the
future. The issue is how best to allocate this budget over time.
A number of modellers have attempted to address this issue.
Unfortunately, to model stabilization costs is a daunting task. It
is difficult enough to forecast the evolution of the energy and
economic system to 2010. Projections over a century or more
are necessary, but must be treated with considerable caution.
They provide useful information, but their value lies not in the
specific numbers but in the insights.
"	Text
"Some insight into the characteristics of the least-cost mitiga-
tion pathway can be obtained from two EMF studies (EMF- 14,
1997; EMF-16, 1999) and from Chapter 2 in the SRES mitiga-
tion scenarios (IPCC, 2000). In the first EMF study, modellers
compared mitigation costs associated with stabilizing concen-
trations at 550ppmv using the WGI and WRE profiles (see
Figure 8.12), Note that the WGI pathway entails lower emis-
sions in the early years, with less rapid reductions later on. The
WRE pathway allows for a more gradual near-term transition
away from carbon-venting fuels. Figure 8.13 shows that in
these models the more gradual near-term transition of the two
examined results in lower mitigation costs.

"This section examines how mitigation costs might vary both
with the stabilization level and with the pathway to stabiliza-

assumption that the stabilization ceiling is known with certain-
ty and neglects the costs of different damages associated with
different pathways (discussed in Chapter 10). Here, the chal-
lenge is to identify the least-cost mitigation pathway to stay
within the prescribed ceiling. In Chapter 10, the issue of deci-
sion-making under uncertainty is discussed regarding the ulti-
mate target and impacts of different pathways. Decision mak-

ly the costs of accelerating the abatement in case of negative
surprises about damages of climate change and adopting a pru-

GDP compared to the baseline due to apparent positive eco-

GDP reduction (averaged across storylines and stabilization
levels) is lowest in 2020 (0.99%), reaches a maximum in 2050

"The economy-wide impact of CO, stabilization was assessed
on the basis of the difference in GDP in baseline scenarios and
corresponding stabilization cases in a given year. This differ-
ence is expressed in percent (reflecting a relative GDP loss)
and is positive when GDP in a baseline scenario is larger than
in a Stabilization case and is negative when GDP in a stabiliza-
tion scenario is larger. Such an approach to measuring effects
of stabilization was selected since it better reflects the societal
burden of emission stabilization than absolute changes in GDP.
For example, a 1% reduction in the 2100 GDP of the SRES Al
world is equal to about US$5.5 trillion and is larger in absolute
terms than a 2% or US$5.0 trillion reduction in the 2100 GDP
of the poor A2 world. Nonetheless, the relative level of effort
in the latter case would be much greater. It should be also
emphasized here that the GDP reduction itself represents a very
crude indicator of economic consequences of the CO, stabi-

"Finally, for higher near-term emissions, the size of the carbon
budget (to meet a prescribed emission target) is higher, reflect-
ing that the products of early emissions have a longer time to
be removed from the atmosphere, and because the higher con-
centrations give higher oceanic and terrestrial sinks.

"Second, the models suggest that currently there are insufficient
low-cost substitutes, on both the supply and demand sides of
the energy sector, for deep near-term cuts in carbon emissions.
With the anticipated improvements in the efficiency of energy
supply, transformation, and end-use technologies, such reduc-
tions should be less expensive in the future.

"Third, because of positive returns on capital, future reductions
can be made with a smaller commitment of today’s resources.
For example, assume a net real rate of return on capital of 5%
per year. Further, suppose that it costs US$50 to remove a
tonne of carbon, regardless of the year in which the reduction
occurs. To remove the tonne today would cost US$50.
Alternatively, it only needs US$19 to be invested today to pro-
vide the resources to remove a tonne of carbon in 2020.
"	Text
"There are several reasons why the models tend to favour a
more gradual departure from their reference path if used to
study a pre-determined concentration level. First, energy using
and energy producing capital stock (e.g., power plants, build-
ings, and transport) are typically long lived. The current system
was put into place on the basis of a particular set of expecta-
tions about the future. Large emission reductions in the near
term require accelerated replacement, which is apt to be costly.
"	Text
"Differences in relative GDP reductions in different scenario
groups are explained by the magnitude of corresponding CO,
emission reductions needed to achieve a particular stabilization
level. The emission reduction is apparently the largest in the
AIFI scenario group, which is also associated with the largest
GDP loss (Figure 8.19). Meanwhile, the smallest relative GDP
loss occurs in the A1T and B1 groups, which have low baseline
emissions and accordingly require the smallest reductions to
reach the CO, stabilization.
"	Text
"Regional GDP reduction patterns in the post-SRES stabiliza-
tion scenarios are also generally explained by corresponding
required reductions in CO, emissions, which are determined by
baseline emissions, the stabilization levels, assumptions about
emissions trading mechanisms and about the relative contribu-
tion of regions to global CO, emissions; reduction and associ-
ated financial and technology transfer. In most of the baseline
(SRES) scenarios starting from 2020, absolute CO, emissions
in developing (non-Annex I) regions remain larger for the rest
of the 21st century than in the industrialized (Annex I) regions.
"	Text
"The fact that the least-cost mitigation pathway tends to follow
the baseline in the early years has been misconstrued by some
analysts as an argument for inaction. Wigley et al. (1996) note
that this is far from the case: First, all stabilization targets still
require future capital stock to be less carbon-intensive than
under a business as usual (BAU) scenario. As most energy pro-
duction and use technologies are long-lived, this has implica-
tions for current investment decisions. Second, new supply
options typically take many years to enter the marketplace. To
ensure sufficient quantities of low-cost, low-carbon substitutes
in the future requires a sustained commitment to research,
development and demonstration today. Third, any no regrets
measures for reducing emissions should be adopted immedi-
ately. Lastly, it is clear that one cannot go on deferring emission
reductions indefinitely, and that the need for substantial reduc-
tions in emissions is sooner the lower the concentration target.

to be set up early even if the effective resulting abatement
shifts from the near-term to the more distant future. If there are
market failures in the R&D market (e.g., knowledge spillover),
then subsidies for R&D are justified as it enhances social wel-

"To the extent that the cost of reducing emissions is lower in the
future than at present, the overall cost of stabilizing the CO,
concentration is less if emissions mitigation is shifted towards
the future. This shift occurs in all models. The extent of the
shift that minimizes the cost of limiting the concentration of
atmospheric CO, depends, at least in part, on the treatment of
technological change. Without technological change, the prob-
lem is simple and the results of Hotelling (1939) apply. With
endogenous technological change, the problem becomes more
complex.

"The discount rate will not be discussed because it is less impor-
tant in cost-efficiency frameworks (when the target is pre-
determined) than in a cost-benefit one (when the discount rate

Chapter 10). Neither are the very few studies discussed which
try to assess different benefits in terms of environmental co-
benefits of reducing GHG emissions presented. Wigley et al.

0.2°C in global mean temperature and 4cm in global mean sea-
level (by 2100) for the WGI and WRE 550 stabilization path-

"However, R&D driven-ITC can reduce the gross costs of a car-
bon tax under special circumstances. Specifically, if R&D has
been substantially over-allocated towards the fossil fuel indus-

reduce this allocative inefficiency and, as a result, its costs can
be quite low or even negative. A substantial prior misallocation
towards carbon-intensive industries could occur if there were
prior subsidies towards R&D in the fossil fuel industries (with
no comparable subsidies in other industries), or if there were
substantial positive spillovers from R&D in non-carbon indus-
tries (with no comparable spillovers in the fossil fuel indus-

"This discussion of the determinants of technological change
must begin with the acknowledgement that no adequate theory
of endogenous technological change exists at present. Many
researchers have contributed to the field, but the present state
of understanding is such that present knowledge is partial and
not necessarily fully consistent. Although no complete theory
of technological change exists, two elements have been identi-
fied and explored in the literature: induced technological
change (ITC) and learning-by-doing (LBD). Work by Ha-
Duong et al. (1997), Grubb et al. (1995), Grubb (1997), and
Kypreos and Barreto (1999) examined the implication of ITC,

imperative to preserve the option of concentration ceilings

"channel for technological change is R&D, ITC makes it prefer-
able to concentrate more abatement efforts in the future. The
reason is that technological change lowers the costs of future
abatement relative to current abatement, making it more cost-
effective to place more emphasis on future abatement.
However, when the channel for technological change is LBD,
the presence of ITC acts in two opposite directions. On the one
hand, ITC makes future abatement less costly but, on the other
hand, there is an added value to current abatement because
such abatement contributes to experience or learning and helps
reduce the costs of future abatement. Which of these two
effects dominates depends on the particular nature of assump-
tions and firms. In recent years, there has been a good deal of
discussion about the potential for ITC (e.g., Anderson et al.,
1999). Proponents argue that such changes might substantially
lower, and perhaps even eliminate, the costs of CO, abatement
policies. These discussions have exposed very divergent views
as to whether technological change can be induced at no cost,
or whether a resource cost is involved. For example, in a 1995
article, Porter and van der Linde (1995) contend that properly
designed regulation can trigger innovation that may partially or
more than fully offset the costs of compliance. Indeed, they
argue that firms can actually benefit from more stringent regu-
lation than that faced by their competitors in other countries.
However, in an accompanying article, a strongly contrary view
is put forward by Palmer et al. (1995). Examining available
data, they found that such offsets pale in comparison to expen-
ditures for pollution abatement and control.

new technologies first appear in niche markets with ris-
ing market shares;

the time of breakthrough of new technologies can be
influenced by policy measures (taxes and R&D) if they
are strong enough;

identification of key technologies, like photovoltaic
modules or fuel cells, for public R&D investments is
difficult; and

technological lock-in effects depend on costs.
"	List
"LBD as a source of technical change was first emphasized by
Arrow (1962). Nakicenovic (1996) discussed the importance
of LBD in energy technology, and Messner (1995) endogenizes
the learning process in energy models. LBD is a happy conse-
quence of those investments in which learning is a result of
cumulative experience with new technologies. LBD typically
refers to reductions in production cost, in which learning takes
place on the shop floor through day-to-day operations, not in
the R&D laboratory. The LBD component of change is signif-
icant too. Kline and Rosenberg (1986) discuss industry studies
that indicate that LBD-type improvements to processes in
some cases contribute more to technological progress than the
initial process development itself.
"	Text
"The key message from this discussion about technical change
is that a clear distinction has to be made between the timing of
action and the timing of abatement. As a result of inertia in
technological innovation, short-term action is required to abate
more in the future, but a given amount of abatement at a given
point in time is not a good measure of the effort. The necessi-
ty of this distinction is reinforced by the consideration of iner-
tia in capital stocks. Mitigation costs are influenced by assump-
tions about the lifespan of existing plants and equipment (e.g.,
power plants, housing, and transport). Energy-related capital
stock is typically long lived and premature retirement is apt to
be costly. For example, an effort to change the transportation
infrastructure will not reduce carbon emissions significantly
for two decades or more. Hence, a drastic departure from the
current trend is impossible without high social costs and a
"	Text
"LBD models use the installed capacity or cumulative use as an
indicator of accumulating knowledge in each sector. The abate-
ment costs are represented by the specific investment costs in
US$/kWh. The models are global and therefore the diffusion
process is not represented. The optimization problems are non-
convex, which raises a difficult computational problem to find
an optimum. However, pioneering work at the International
Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (ITASA) on the MES-
SAGE model and additional developments based on models
like MARKAL and ERIS; (MATSSON), Kypreos and Barreto
(1999), Seebregts er al. (1999a), (SKFB), Tseng et al. (1999),
and Kypreos et al. (2000) demonstrate progress in this direc-
tion. They show that several technologies are likely to play a
prominent role in reducing the cost of abatement, if ITC is
indeed taken into account when computing the equilibrium. A
problem with modelling endogenous technological change is
"	Text
"These findings must be tempered by the fact that the models
are not only highly non-linear systems, and therefore poten-
tially sensitive to input assumptions, but also the quantitative
values employed by modellers are typically drawn from suc-
cessful historical examples. Furthermore, the empirical foun-
dations of LBD are drawn from observations of the relation-
ship between cumulative deployment and/or investment in new
technology and cost. This relationship is equally consistent
with the hypothesis that a third factor reduced costs, in turn
leading to increases in demand. The authors restrict their find-
ings to more qualitative assertions, because of the limitations
of current models (Messner, 1997; Griibler and Messner, 1998;
Barreto and Kypreos, 1999; Seebregts et al., 1999a, 1999b).
The research so far has been limited to energy system models
and ignored other forms of endogenous, complex changes that
are important for emissions, like changes in lifestyles and
social institutions.
"	Text
"The same model has been employed to compare the costs of
achieving a given abatement target through carbon taxes and
R&D subsidies (Schneider and Goulder, 1997; Goulder and
Schneider, 1999). If there are no spillovers to R&D, the least-
cost way to reach a given abatement target is through a carbon
tax alone. The carbon tax best targets the externality from the
combustion of fossil fuels related to climate change, and thus
is the most cost-effective. However, if there are spillovers to
R&D, the least-cost way to achieve a given abatement target is
through the combination of a carbon tax and R&D subsidy. If
spillovers are present, there is a market failure in the R&D
market as well as a (climate change related) market failure
associated with the use of carbon. Two instruments (the R&D
subsidy and the carbon tax) are needed to address the two dis-
tinct market failures most efficiently. In general, a R&D sub-
sidy by itself does not offer the least-cost approach to reducing
carbon emissions. Results from this model are highly sensitive
to assumptions about the nature and extent of knowledge
spillovers. Further empirical work that sheds light on these
spillovers would have considerable value.
"	Text
"delay of action in this sector will require higher abatement
costs in the more flexible sectors to meet a given target. Lecocq
et al. (1999) found that these costs would be increased by 18%
in 2020 for a 550ppmv target and by 150% for a 450ppmv tar-
get.
"	Text
"This irreversibility built into technological change is far more
critical when the uncertainty about the ultimate target is con-
sidered. In this case indeed, many of the parameters that legit-
imize the postponing of abatement play in the opposite direc-
tion. If indeed the concentration constraints turn out to be
lower than anticipated, there may be a need for abrupt reduc-
tion in emissions and premature retirement of equipment. In
other words, even if the permanent costs of an option (in case
of perfect expectation) are lower than those of an alternative
option, it may be the case that its transition costs are higher
because of inertia. For example, two ideal transportation sys-
tems can be envisaged, one relying on gasoline, the other on
"	Text
"electric cars and railways, both with comparable costs in a sta-
bilized situation; however, a brutal transition from the first sys-
tem to the second may be economically disruptive and politi-
cally unsustainable. These issues are examined in more depth
in Chapter 10 because the selection of the ultimate target
depends upon the decision-making framework and upon the
nature of the damage functions. But, it matters here to insist on
the fact that the more inertia is built into the technical system,
and the less processes of learning by doing and induced tech-
nical change have operated, the more costly corrections of tra-
jectories in hedging strategies will be, for example, moving
from a 550ppmv concentration goal to 450ppmv (Ha-Duong et
al., 1997; see also Grubb et al., 1995; Grubb, 1997). This pos-
sibility of switching from one objective to another is support-
ed by current material regarding climate damages, in particular
(Tol, 1996) if the rate of change is considered in the analysis
and the delay between symptoms and the response by society
(see Chapter 10).

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
"	Title
"Within this broad picture, certain sectors will be substantially
affected by mitigation. The coal industry, producing the most
carbon-intensive of products, faces almost inevitable decline in
the long term relative to the baseline projection. However,
technologies still under development, such as carbon dioxide
(CO,) sequestration from coal-burning plants and in-situ gasi-
fication, could play a future role in maintaining the output of
"	Text
"However, the studies typically do not consider some or all of
the following factors that could lessen the impact on oil pro-
duction and trade. They usually do not include policies and
measures for non-CO, GHGs or non-energy sources of GHGs,
offsets from sinks, and actions under the Kyoto Protocol relat-
ed to funding, insurance, and the transfer of technology. In
addition, the studies typically do not include other policies and
effects that can reduce the total cost of mitigation, such as the
use of tax revenues to reduce tax burdens, ancillary environ-
"	Text
"There is a fundamental problem for mitigation policies. It is
well established that, compared to the situation for potential
gainers, the potential sectoral losers are easier to identify, and
their losses are likely to be more immediate, more concentrat-
ed, and more certain. The potential sectoral gainers (apart from
the renewables sector and perhaps the natural gas sector) can
only expect a small, diffused, and rather uncertain gain, spread
over a long period. Indeed many of those who may gain do not
exist, being future generations and industries yet to develop.
"	Text
"Policies adopted to mitigate global warming will have implica-
tions for specific sectors, such as the coal industry, the oil and
gas industry, electricity, manufacturing, transportation and
households. A sectoral assessment helps to put the costs in per-
spective, to identify the potential losers, and the extent and
location of the losses, as well as to identify the sectors that may
benefit. However, it is worth noting that the available literature
to make this assessment is limited: there are few comprehen-
sive studies of the sectoral effects of mitigation, compared with
those on the macro gross domestic product (GDP) effects, and
they tend to be for Annex B countries and regions.
"	Text
"Particularly large effects on the coal sector are expected from
policies such as the removal of fossil fuel subsidies or the
restructuring of energy taxes so as to tax the carbon content
rather than the energy content of fuels. It is a well-established
finding that removal of the subsidies would result in substan-
tial reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as well as
stimulating economic growth. However, the effects in specific
countries depend heavily on the type of subsidy removed and
the commercial viability of alternative energy sources, includ-
ing imported coal; and there may be adverse distributional
effects.
"	Text
"coal whilst reducing CO, and other emissions. The oil industry
also faces a potential relative decline, although this may be
moderated by (1) lack of substitutes for oil in transportation
and (2) substitution away from solid fuels towards liquid fuels
in electricity generation. Modelling studies suggest that miti-
gation policies may have the least impact on oil, the most
impact on coal, with the impact on gas somewhere between;
these findings are established but incomplete. The high varia-
tion across studies for the effects of mitigation on gas demand
is associated with the importance of its availability in different
locations, its specific demand patterns, and the potential for gas
to replace coal in power generation.
"	Text
"There is a wide range of estimates for the impact of imple-
mentation of the Kyoto Protocol on the oil market using glob-
al models and stylized policies. All studies show net growth in
both oil production and revenue to at least 2020 with or with-
out mitigation. They show that implementation leads to a fall
in oil-exporting countries’ revenues, GDP, income or welfare,
but significantly less impact on the real price of oil than has
resulted from market fluctuations over the past 30 years. Of the
studies surveyed, the largest fall in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) revenues is a 25%
reduction in 2010 below the baseline projection, assuming no
permit trading and implying a 17% fall in oil prices; the reduc-
tion in OPEC revenues becomes just over 7% with Annex B
trading.
"	Text
"It is also well established that the overall effects on GDP of
mitigation policies and measures, whether positive or negative,
conceal large differences between sectors. In general, the ener-
gy intensity and the carbon intensity of the economies will
decline. The coal and perhaps the oil industries are expected to
lose substantial proportions of output relative to those in the
reference scenarios, but other sectors may increase their out-
puts yet by much smaller proportions. Energy-intensive sec-
tors, such as heavy chemicals, iron and steel, and mineral prod-
ucts, will face higher costs, accelerated technical or organiza-
tional change, or loss of output (again relative to the reference
scenario) depending on their energy use and the policies adopt-
ed for mitigation. Other industries, including renewables and
services, can be expected to benefit in the long term from the
availability of financial and other resources that would other-
wise have been taken up in fossil fuel production. They may
also benefit from reductions in tax burdens, if taxes are used
for mitigation, and the revenues recycled as reductions in
employer or corporate or other taxes.

"Industries concerned directly with mitigation are likely to ben-
efit from action. These include renewable electricity, producers
of mitigation equipment (incorporating energy- and carbon-
saving technologies), agriculture and forestry producing ener-
gy crops, research services producing energy and carbon-sav-
ing research and development (R&D). The extent and nature of
the benefits will vary with the policies followed. Some mitiga-
tion policies can lead to overall economic benefits, implying
that the gains from many sectors will outweigh the losses for
coal and other fossil fuels, and energy-intensive industries. In
contrast, other less well-designed policies can lead to overall
losses.

"models and studies. Large differences in results can arise from
the use of different reference scenarios or baselines. The char-
acteristics of the baseline can also markedly affect the quanti-
tative results of modelling mitigation policy. For example, if
air quality is assumed to be satisfactory in the baseline, then the
potential for air-quality ancillary benefits in any GHG mitiga-
tion scenario is ruled out by assumption. Even with similar or
the same baseline assumptions, the studies yield different
results. As regards the costs of mitigation, these differences
appear to be largely a result of different approaches and
assumptions, with the most important being the type of model
adopted. Bottom-up engineering models assuming new tech-
nological opportunities tend to show benefits from mitigation.
Top-down, general equilibrium models appear to show lower
costs than top-down, time-series econometric models. The
main assumptions leading to lower costs in the models are that:
"	Text
"The very likely direct costs for fossil fuel consumption are
accompanied by very likely environmental and public health
benefits associated with a reduction in the extraction and burn-
ing of the fuels. These benefits come from a reduction in the
damages caused by these activities, especially the reduction in
the emissions of pollutants that are associated with combus-
tion, such as sulphur dioxide (SO,), nitrogen oxides (NO,),
carbon monoxide (CO) and other chemicals, and particulate
matter. This will improve local and regional air and water qual-
ity, and thereby lessen damage to human, animal and plant
health and the ecosystem. If all the pollutants associated with
GHG emissions are removed by new technologies or end-of-
pipe abatement (for example, flue gas desulphurization on a
power station combined with removal of all other non-GHG
pollutants), then this ancillary benefit will no longer exist. But
removal of all pollutants is limited at present and it is expen-
sive, especially for small-scale emissions from dwellings and
cars.

the benefits and costs of mitigation have largely been measured

implications. For a definition of co-benefits and ancillary ben-

mitigation policies, see Chapter 8.

"These studies tend to use large-scale models as a framework

arise from the type of model being used (computable general
equilibrium (CGE) or econometric), the method chosen for the
recycling of any tax revenues, and the treatment of the world
oil market. Two topics, the effects of carbon taxes (and more
recently traded emission permits) and the removal of energy
subsidies, have been assessed in some detail.

bottom-up studies that do not consider general effects but
examine technology-driven options!; and

"When assessing the sectoral responses to mitigation policies
and measures, a distinction can be made between commercial
firms (partnerships or corporations) and persons (such as car
drivers and home-owners) as decision makers. Firms are gen-
erally expected to be more price-responsive in their fuel use,
because of better access to capital, information, and technolo-
gies, while persons generally value lifestyles more highly in
their fuel use decisions. Although “sectors” are largely taken to
be industrial contributors to GDP, households and private
motorists are also responsible for large amounts of greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions and are also covered in this chapter.

"This chapter continues with reviews of results from multisectoral
studies (9.2.1), followed by those on each major sector in turn
(coal, petroleum and gas, non-fossil-based energy, agriculture
and forestry, manufacturing, construction, transport, service
industries, and households in Sections 9.2.2 to 9.2.11). Section
9.3 reviews the literature on sectoral spillover effects of mitiga-
tion in one country or region on the rest of the world. Ancillary
benefits associated with particular sectors or with sectoral miti-
gation policies are covered in Sections 9.2.2 to 9.2.11. Section
9.4 considers why the macro and sectoral studies come to differ-
ent conclusions. Section 9.5 suggests areas for further research.

"The definitions of sectors adopted in this chapter is that of the
UN System of National Accounts (1993 ISIC). This is an inter-
nationally agreed set of definitions, conventions, and accounts
which includes the division of the macro economy into indus-
trial sectors, such as manufacturing. The data for sectoral eco-
nomic models are usually arranged according to these
accounts, and the results of the models reported below (in as
much as they provide a comprehensive sectoral disaggregation
of the macroeconomic effects) will follow these definitions.
However, the energy sector is further subdivided in this chap-
ter, since the mitigation effects are so important and distinct for
the component industries, namely coal, oil and gas, and elec-
tricity.

objectives, oriented towards encouraging economic efficiency

"Coal subsidies have encouraged high production of coal in a
number of industrial countries and high coal consumption in
numerous developing and transition economies (OECD,
1997c). For example, a complete measure of the total support
to producers can be estimated in the form of the producer sub-
sidy equivalent (PSE), which has been calculated annually by
the International Energy Agency (IEA) for several countries
since 1988 (IEA, 1998b). DRI (1994) used revised versions of
the IEA’s coal PSE estimates (shown in Table 9.2) to model the
effects of removing subsidies. These subsidies tend to increase
GHG emissions and more general pollution.

"Empirical and theoretical studies indicate that no regrets poli-
cies can result from the removal of subsidies from fossil fuels
or from electricity that relies on fossil fuels. The UN
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC article
4.2e (ii)) calls for Annex I Parties “to identify and periodically
review its own policies and practices which encourage ...
[greater emissions] than would otherwise occur”. The Kyoto
Protocol calls for such Parties to “implement ... measures ...
such as ... progressive reduction or phasing out of market
imperfections, fiscal incentives, tax and duty exemptions and
subsidies in all greenhouse gas emitting sectors that run
counter to the objective of the Convention ...”.

"(1) The nature of the recycling of revenues from new taxes or
permit schemes is critical to the sectoral effects (and the
overall GDP effects - see Chapters 7 and 8 for a detailed
discussion of the recycling literature). In some of the stud-
ies (e.g. Garbaccio et al., 1999, 2000), GDP is increased
above the reference scenario when rates for some burden-
some tax are reduced. Those studies that report reductions
in GDP do not always provide a range of recycling options,
suggesting that policy packages that increase GDP have
not been explored.

(2) Reductions in fossil fuel output below the reference case
will not impact all fossil fuels equally. Fuels have different
costs and price sensitivities, they respond differently to
mitigation policies, energy-efficiency technology is fuel
and combustion device specific, and reductions in demand
can affect imports differently from output. Large effects on
gas output are discussed below in section 9.2.3.2.

(3) In most instances the relative decline in output does not
imply an absolute decline of the sector; rather it implies a
decline in its rate of growth. This is particularly true for the
oil sector, where under present technology there is a cap-
tive market in the use of oil for personal transportation,
which is expected to increase substantially over the fore-
seeable future (this is not shown in Table 9.1, but reflected
in the literature).

(4) The sectoral results suggest that agriculture usually bene-
fits’. The effects on manufacturing are mixed and the rea-
sons for these results are explored below. Finally, the ser-
vice sectors generally increase their output as a result of
the policy shifts; since services are such a large proportion
of GDP, if the overall economy has higher output this usu-
ally implies that services have higher output.

"In spite of these results, it is not wise to generalize about the
environmental and economic effects of removing subsidies in
the energy industry (OECD, 1997c). For example, the effect of
removing subsidies to coal producers depends heavily on the
type of subsidy removed and the availability and economics of
alternative energy sources, including imported coal. Removing
some electricity sector subsidies may have very little effect on
GHG emissions or may even increase emissions, for example,
when subsidies to electricity supply industry investment are
supporting the use of less polluting energy sources. Finally,
there may be cases where removing a subsidy to an energy-
intensive industry in one country would lead to a shift in pro-
duction to other countries with lower costs or environmental
standards, resulting in a net increase in global GHG emissions

dies with optimal taxes. According to global studies, even
without adding new taxes, removing the subsidies and trade
barriers at a sectoral level would create a win-win situation,
improving efficiency and reducing the environmental damage
(Burniaux et al., 1992; Hoeller and Coppel, 1992; Larson and
Shah, 1992, 1995; Anderson and McKibbin, 1997). It is a well-
established finding that removal of these subsidies would result
in substantial reductions in GHG emissions, as well as stimu-
lating economic growth. Local studies also indicate that
removing support to the production and use of coal and other
fossil fuels can result in substantial reductions in CO, emis-
sions in the main coal-using countries, at the same time as
reducing the cost of electricity production (DRI, 1994; Shelby

"The effects of the Kyoto Mechanisms at the sectoral level are
complex. The available studies have looked at the effect of
international emissions trading, but there have been no com-
prehensive studies on the sectoral effects of the Clean
Development Mechanism (CDM) or joint implementation (JI).
Countries buying assigned amount units (AAUs), or funding
CDM and JI projects, may have less need to reduce fossil fuel
consumption. Therefore, the sectors in these countries that
depend on fossil fuel production or use may experience small-
er economic impacts (Brown ef al., 1999). This would also
reduce the impact on fossil fuel producers, both at the domes-
tic and international level. However, countries selling credits,
or hosting JI and CDM projects, will have to generate these
AAUs or Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) through either
reduction of GHG emissions or enhancement of sinks. The
economic impact on sectors within those countries will vary
depending on the source of the credits. Some sectors will ben-
efit, while others may see reduced rates of growth. Until the
tules for implementation of the Kyoto mechanisms have been
decided, sectoral impacts of their use will remain speculative.

"GHG mitigation is expected to lead to a decline in coal output

1987 (WCI, 1999). The process may lead to higher costs, espe-

tion options that exist for the production and use of coal. These

"Some of the options detailed in Chapter 3 could represent a
“win-win” situation for GHG mitigation and the coal sector.
For example, GHG mitigation can be achieved by reducing the
coal sector’s own energy consumption, beneficiation and coal-
bed CH, recovery, whilst maintaining coal production. Other
options have clear, but often non-quantifiable, costs and/or
ancillary benefits attached to them. The study Asia least-cost
GHG abatement strategy (ALGAS)-India (ADB-GEF-UNDP,
1998a) reports that Indian CO, abatement would be primarily
achieved by fuel switching and, to some extent, by a shift to
more expensive but more efficient technologies. The most
affected sector is coal as its consumption is modelled to
decrease in power generation, followed by the industrial and
residential sectors. The study concludes that this could lead to
a significant reduction in labour employment in the coal sector.
For China, using a dynamic linear programming model, Rose

"At the global level, Bartsch and Miiller (2000) report results
that suggest a significant reduction in the OECD’s demand for

Coal demand is modelled to fall by 4.4mtoe? per day from this
baseline in 2010 and 2020. Knapp (2000) indicates a substan-

countries to the rest of the world as coal becomes more expen-

tives, this could be viewed as a positive equity contribution
with economic benefits for non-Annex B countries. Knapp also
indicates that the reduction in coal exports to Annex B coun-
tries for thermal power generation will severely impact some
coal-exporting countries. In particular Colombia, Indonesia,
and South Africa will incur substantial losses in export income
with attendant job and revenue losses. These costs might, to an

"The market for crude oil is global, and a reduction in demand
will affect all exporters via the price mechanism. However, the
national economic impact of reduced demand varies greatly
depending on the actual cost of production of crude oil and the
degree to which the economies of individual producer coun-
tries are dependent on oil exports. It should be noted that the
cost of production for crude oil can be very different from the
market price, which includes royalties paid to government,
transportation costs, and profit. Low-cost producers will be
able to tolerate declines in the price of crude oil better than
high-cost producers will. The more dependent a country is on
oil and gas exports, the more its economy will be impacted if
the value of these exports decreases.

"Oil is exported by more than 40 countries worldwide with 11
of which are members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC). OPEC accounts for 76% of
world crude oil reserves, 41% of world production and 55% of
world exports (BP Amoco, 1999). On the other hand, around
54% of the world’s downstream refining capacities are in the
OECD, which controls 30% of the world’s crude production.
The petroleum industry is divided into two sectors, the
“upstream” which involves finding and producing crude oil,
and the “downstream” which involves refining crude oil into
petroleum products and marketing those products to end-users.
The distinction between OPEC and/or non-OPEC and
upstream and/or downstream aspects of the market and indus-
try is useful in assessing the impact of mitigation on prices,
output and wealth.

"The main ancillary benefits associated with reduction in coal
burning, namely public health impacts, are considered in
Chapter 8. However, there are also some ancillary benefits of
mitigation directly affecting the coal industry. Mitigation could
increase energy efficiency in coal utilization (Tunnah er al.,
1994; Li et al., 1995). The uptake of new, high efficiency, clean
coal technologies (IEA, 1998b) could lead to enhanced skills
levels and technological capacity in developing nations.
Further benefits include increased productivity as a conse-
quence of increased market pressures, as well as the extension
of the life of coal reserves. The costs of adjustment will be
much lower if policies for new coal production also encourage
clean-coal technology. Mitigation also may favour coal pro-
duction in non-Annex B countries as a result of the migration
of energy-intensive industries to developing countries (carbon
leakage), although estimates of the scale of such leakage are
highly dependent on the assumptions made in the models
(Bernstein and Pan, 2000). There are also potential benefits in
enhancing research and development (R&D) in the coal indus-
try, especially in finding alternative and non-emitting applica-
tions for coal (IEA, 1999).

"Pershing (2000) notes that internal economic growth could off-
set the negative export impacts within 5 years for Colombia
and Indonesia, but not for South Africa. In this regard he
reports that South Africa could feel the greatest impacts of the
major non-Annex B coal-exporting countries. In particular, he
forecasts revenue losses for Indonesia and South Africa as
being as high as 1% and 4% of gross national product (GNP)
respectively. Dunn (2000) reports that the coal industry has
been shedding jobs for several years now and this trend is like-
ly to continue in the coal industry as GHG mitigation actions
take effect. Pershing (2000), however, suggests that such
impacts may not materialize as a result of the implementation
of the Climate Convention or Kyoto Protocol commitments.
For example, most projections are based on the use of macro-
economic models - most of which do not take into account fos-
sil fuel distribution effects at the national level, or the use of
CO, sinks or non-CO, GHG mitigation options. Pershing also
suggests that some of these impacts may be offset by other
aspects of future energy and development paths. For example,
in a world in which climate change mitigation policies have
been taken, investment in non-conventional oil supply might
be deferred - lowering the impacts on conventional fuel

"These and other studies show a wide range of estimates for the
impact of GHG mitigation policies on oil production and rev-
enue. Much of these differences are attributable to the assump-
tions made about: the availability of conventional oil reserves,
the degree of mitigation required, the use of emission trading,
control of GHGs other than CO,, and the use of carbon sinks.
However, all studies show net growth in both oil production
and revenue to at least 2020. As Pershing (2000) points out,
these studies show significantly less impact on the real price of
oil than has resulted from market fluctuations over the past 30
years. This feature (well-established) is illustrated in Figure

reduced to a fall of just over 7% with Annex B trading.

PETRO model. They use an optimizing, intertemporal equilib-
rium model with three demand regions (OECD-Europe, rest-
OECD and non-OECD) and two supply regions (OPEC and the
competitive fringe). They find that in the first 40 years starting
in 1995, given a US$10/barrel oil-equivalent (boe°) carbon tax

wealth by 58%-74% and non-OPEC wealth by 70%-96%. The
average producer could lose about 10% of their wealth at the
low tax assumption (US$3/barrel) and around two-thirds of
their wealth at the high tax assumption (US$24/barrel). The
marginal carbon tax increase would reduce the producers’

"Donovan et al. (1997) model the economic impact of two CO,
emission reduction scenarios compared to a reference case
with no limits on emissions. In their less stringent scenario,
Annex B countries stabilize their CO, emissions from fossil
fuels at 1990 levels by 2010; in their more stringent scenario,
they reduce their emissions to 15% below 1990 levels by 2010.
Their model projections show oil use in 2010 reduced by 3.7%
and 5.9% respectively in the less severe and more severe sce-
narios. These relatively small reductions are attributed to the
fact that most oil is used in the transport sector where there is
relatively little opportunity for substitution. In 2010, in the less
stringent case, the value of oil exports from non-Annex B to
Annex B countries declines by about 8%.

"by 8%, and the tax revenue would be collected by consuming
countries. The tax reduces CO, emissions by 20% below the
baseline levels over the first 50 years, and then eliminates fos-
sil fuel combustion altogether by 2110; this comes about
through an assumption of a falling real price for backstop (car-
bon-free) technology. Lindholt (1999) follows up this study,
looking at the implications of a CO, tradable auctioned permit
scheme to meet (a) Kyoto-style targets interpreted as CO, (not
GHG) targets and (b) a global reduction below 1990 levels of
5.2% with emissions held constant 2010 to 2100. OPEC’s pro-
duction in (a) is reduced by 10% relative to the baseline in
2010 (the permit price is US$6.2/boe) rising sharply after 2040
before falling to zero in 2070, but oil prices are maintained to
2010; in (b) the reduction is 22% by 2010. Again for 2010 most
of the permit revenues go to Annex B countries.

The welfare losses in energy exporting countries are no greater
than that in other regions owing to the influence of backstop
technologies on crude oil price and the net oil exports of the
energy exporters. The OECD’s lower production of the back-
stop (carbon-intensive heavy oil) leads to increased demand for
crude oil; in addition the oil price is higher. Without the back-

largest welfare loss of all the regions.

The electric utility sector, the largest user of coal, can
switch to natural gas, but the rate of switching will be
limited by regional natural gas availability.

Given the above considerations, modelling studies sug-
gest that Annex B countries are likely to meet their
Kyoto Protocol commitments by reducing overall ener-

"Sutherland (1998) reports on a study of the impact of high
energy prices on six energy-intensive industries, including
petroleum refining. Prices of refined petroleum products are
increased in two steps: US$75/tC in 2005 and US$150/tC in
2010. The mechanism of the price increase is not described;
thus there is no discussion of who receives the revenues or how
they are handled. The study finds that these price increases
reduce the US demand for refined products by about 20%. The
cost of other energy sources is also increased, which along with
decreased demand, raises the cost of refining in OECD coun-
tries and intensifies the on-going shift of refining capacity from
OECD to non-OECD countries. Shifting refining capacity to
non-OECD countries reduces employment in, and increases
imports by, OECD countries. Reductions in fuel use results in
reductions in the emissions of local air pollutants.

"Natural gas has the lowest carbon content of the fossil fuels,
and it is generally assumed that its use will increase as the
result of efforts to reduce CO, emissions. Because of this and
the possibilities for substitution in the power generation sector
away from coal, Ferriter (1997) shows an increasing demand
for natural gas in the two carbon tax scenarios and the effi-
ciency-driven scenario compared to the reference case.
Switching towards natural gas - especially high efficiency
combined cycle and co-generation - is likely to be a very
important part of reaching Kyoto targets in some countries.
However, other studies (IEA, 1998b; IWG, 1997; EIA, 1998)
conclude that the emissions limits set by the Kyoto Protocol
will require reductions in total use of electricity and replace-
ment of older generating capacity with non-fossil fuel units,

Reduced growth in demand for natural gas will have similar

they either mandate or directly provide incentives for increased
use of zero-emitting technologies (such as nuclear, hydro, and
other renewables) and lower-GHG-emitting generation tech-

indirectly they drive their increased use by more flexible
approaches that place a tax on or require a permit for emission
of GHGs. Either way, the result will be a shift in the mix of
fuels used to generate electricity towards increased use of the
zero- and lower-emitting generation technologies, and away

et al., 1996; Piscitello and Bogach, 1997; European
Commission, 1997). In some European countries such as
Sweden and Austria, carbon taxes have been introduced. In
Japan, nuclear power is planned to supply 480TWh in 2010, or
17.4% of total primary energy supply, to help meet the Kyoto
target (Fujime, 1998). In contrast, in Sweden, a policy under
debate to phase out nuclear power and restrict CO, emissions
to 1990 levels by other means would result in significantly
higher electricity prices (Anderson and Haden, 1997)

these models has generally been on broader economy-wide
impacts, and many do not report results for the electricity sector.
McKibbin et al. (1999) reported the price and quantity impacts
on electric utilities if the USA unilaterally implements its Kyoto
commitments. Under this scenario, electricity prices in the USA
increase 7.2% in 2010 and 12.6% in 2020, while demand drops
6.2% and 9.5% in those years, respectively. The Australian
Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE,
1995) reported shifts in fuel share for Annex B under a policy
where this group of countries stabilizes emissions at 1990 levels
by 2000. They show that the share of coal in the generation of
electricity for most Annex B countries would drop by 10% to
50%, with the combined shares for nuclear and renewables
increasing 14 to 46%.° (See Table 9.7 for detailed results.) They
note that such a policy may require substantial structural
changes in the industry and are likely to involve significant
costs, but do not elaborate or quantify.

Electricity demand was projected to decrease 4% to

Prices of natural gas were projected to increase by 35%
to 206% over the baseline levels. Prices of coal for elec-
tricity production were projected to increase to about
2.5 to 9 times the baseline levels. And, despite a 7% to
40% decrease in fossil generation, fossil fuel expendi-
tures increase 81% to 238% over baseline levels.
About 9% to 43% of total generation will shift away
from coal relative to the baseline. The large shift over
this limited time period would reflect significant struc-

Roughly half of this is replaced by natural gas genera-

is defined as the accumulated hourly O, concentrations above
40 ppb (80 mg/m?) during daylight hours between May and
July. Acumulative exposure less than 6000 mg/m*.h is neces-
sary to prevent an excess of 5% crop yield loss (European
Environment Agency, 1999). Observations indicate that this
limit is exceeded in most of Europe with the exception of the
northern parts of Scandinavia and the UK (European
Environment Agency, 1999). Median summer afternoon O,
concentrations in the majority of the eastern and southwestern
United States presently exceed 50 ppb (Fiore ef al., 1998). As
shown in Figure 9.3 these concentrations will result in yield
reductions in excess of 10% for several crops. IPCC Working
Group (WG)I (Chapter 4) predicts that, if emissions follow
their SRES A2 scenario, by 2100 background O, levels near
the surface at northern mid-latitudes will rise to nearly 80ppb.

Europe (U.K. DoE, 1997) and Japan (Kobayashi, 1997). These
studies indicate that, for many crop species, it is well estab-

reduction in yield. The US Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) funded the National Crop Loss Assessment Network
(NCLAN) from 1980 to 1986, which developed O, dose-plant

EUROCLAN found yield reductions to be highly correlated

another perspective, these net job gains might be all provided

the redirected investments in energy-efficient and low-carbon
technologies would produce additional employment equivalent
to the jobs supported by about 6200 small manufacturing
plants that open in the year 2010. While these impacts are
small in relation to the larger economy, it is because the scale

of advanced coking-oven systems by the iron and steel indus-
try in China. Without changes in policy only 15.9% of existing
ovens will be replaced by advanced ones by 2010. With a car-
bon tax, but without a subsidy, the replacement share rises to
62%. With a tax and subsidies for energy-saving technologies,
the share rises to 100%, i.e. the advanced ovens will be fully
adopted by the industry. They also mention that taxes with sub-
sidies do not give the best solutions for other sectors. They
conclude that a carbon tax with subsidy could have reduced

society, does reduce transportation energy use. However, the
reductions are smaller than often assumed, because they are
partially offset by increased household energy use, and because
some telecommuters do so only for part of their working day.
Care must be taken in extrapolating future reductions from the
limited case studies currently available; the behaviour of early-

the medium term, macro view, information technologies

and/or the desire to improve local environmental quality. The
auto industry has responded to these policies with the intro-
duction of successive generations of technology to improve
passenger car efficiency. However, total passenger car fuel use
has increased steadily as improvements in vehicle efficiency
have been overwhelmed by increases in car sizes and car traf-

from 193 to 477 million between 1970 and 1995, and total
kilometres travelled have risen from 2.6 to 7.0 trillion vehicle-
kilometres between 1970 and 1995 (OECD, 1997b). While
growth in passenger car numbers has slowed in OECD coun-

"Because gasoline is already taxed at a very high level in many
countries, and the cost of fuel is a small portion of the total cost
of driving, even fairly substantial increases in the cost of the
fuel (as a GHG mitigation policy) may have little impact on
vehicle use. The net present cost to the consumer of a tax
equivalent to US$300/tC is approximately 5% of the capital
cost of a typical new vehicle, assuming an initial cost of
US$20,000, 12,000 km/year, and a 10-year life (IEA, 1997b).
Furthermore, the users of company and/or government-provid-
ed cars may not be responsive to the increase in fuel cost at all,
a typical case of principal-agent problem (see Chapter 3 and
Chapter 6).

"The Australian Bureau of Transport and Communications
Economics (BTCE, 1996) examine the social costs of 16 mea-
sures to reduce GHG emissions from the transport sector. In the
longer term, five of these measures: (1) metropolitan road user
charges, (2) reduced urban public transport fares, (3) city-wide
parking charges, (4) labelling of new cars to inform buyers of
their fuel efficiency, and (5) shifting inter-capital freight from
road to rail were found to be “no regrets” options, i.e., they had
zero or negative costs to society as a whole. Together these
measures could reduce emissions from the Australian transport
sector by about 5% to 10% of total projected emissions. A car-

"Initiatives to improve fuel economy continue, often with the
express intention of reducing GHG emissions. European car
manufacturers have voluntarily agreed to reduce the fuel con-
sumption of new cars by 20% by 2010. In 1993, US car manu-
facturers entered into a partnership for a new generation vehi-
cle (PNGV) with the US government aimed at developing a
passenger car with triple the current fuel economy (to about 80
miles per gallon), by 2004, with no increase in cost or loss of
performance compared with current vehicles. The incremental
costs of these vehicles have been estimated to be as low as
$2,500/car (DeCicco and Mark, 1997) to as high as more than
$6,000/car (Duleep, 1997; OTA, 1995). Since these vehicles
will be designed to meet the emissions standards anticipated to
be in effect when they are produced, no ancillary local air pol-
lution benefit is expected.

"However, much of the increase in fuel efficiency may be taken
up in increased demand for fuel if the lower operating costs are
translated into increased ownership and use of vehicles. In
addition, Dowlatabadi et al. (1996) find that increasing fuel
economy to 60 miles per gallon had little beneficial effect on
urban ozone concentration, and could decrease the safety of
passenger cars unless offsetting steps were taken. Wang et al.
(1998) estimate the capital investment required in the USA
through to 2030 for fuel production and distribution to be (1)
US$100bn (1995$) or less if the fuel for PNGV cars is refor-
mulated gasoline or diesel, ethanol, methanol, liquefied petro-
leum gas (LPG), or liquefied natural gas (LNG); (2) approxi-
mately US$150bn for di-methyl ether; and (3) in the order of
US$500bn for hydrogen. No estimate was made of the cost of
applying this technology outside the USA.

"Freight transportation has been growing rapidly as a result of
the growth of international merchandise trade, which has sur-
passed the growth in the world economy over the last two
decades (IEA, 1997b). EIA (1998) consider the impacts of car-
bon fees to reduce US carbon emissions to 3% below 1990 lev-
els, the amount estimated by the US administration as neces-
sary to meet its Kyoto Protocol commitments when reductions
in the emissions of other gases were taken into account. These
fees raise the cost of diesel fuel by US$0.68/gallon, but result
in only a 4.9% reduction in US freight truck travel, most of
which is a result of lower economic activity. US rail transport
is projected to decline by 32%, largely as the result of a 71%
reduction in the demand for coal. The cost of marine fuel is
projected to rise by US$0.84/gallon, nearly twice the reference
price, but domestic shipping is projected to decline by only
10% (EIA, 1998).

"Many parts of the developing world are faced with severe envi-
ronmental problems caused in part by a rapid growth in the use
of personal vehicles (scooters, motor cycles, mopeds, and
cars). Many of these vehicles are old and poorly maintained,
use two-stroke engines, and operate on inadequate road sys-
tems. The result is traffic congestion, greater fuel consumption,
and noise and air pollution that degrade the urban environment.
Bose (1998) finds that improving public transportation to meet
as much as 80% of travel demand, and promoting cleaner fuels
and improved engine technologies (i.e., phasing out two-stroke
engines, increasing the share of cars equipped with three-way
catalytic converters, using unleaded gasoline, electric vehicles,
and vehicles fuelled with compressed natural gas) in six Indian
cities can significantly reduce both emissions and fuel con-
sumption. Total fuel savings for the six cities is 0.83mtoe (see
footnote 3) in 2010 to 2011, and automotive emissions are
reduced 30%-80% compared with a baseline case.

gestion will also lower potential exposures to known hazards
from the burning of road fuels, especially to those living near
to congested roadways. Children are at high risk from the dam-

"Section 9.2.8.2 lists several options for transport policies to mit-
igate GHGs. Some of these options, such as expanded reliance
on mass transit and shifts away from individual passenger vehi-
cles, can be expected to decrease the number of traffic crashes.
The total number of damages resulting from crashes is substan-
tial. With respect to traffic deaths and disabilities, the World
Bank reports that traffic crashes are already the leading cause of
death for young males and the 5th leading cause of death for
young females worldwide. About 75% of all deaths occur in
developing countries, although they have less than 1/4 of all
vehicles. If present trends continue to 2020, one fourth of all
health costs in developing countries may be spent on treating
road injuries alone (Ross, 1999). However, policies that encour-
age the use of smaller vehicles could have increased death and
injuries caused by traffic crashes (Dowlatabadi er al., 1996).

"The total of health damage costs from road traffic is signifi-
cant. A recent study jointly produced by agencies of the Swiss,
French and Austrian ministries of health, environment, and
economy estimates that the annual number of deaths linked to
traffic based pollution in these countries exceeds those that
occur because of traffic crashes alone. This study uses a will-
ingness-to-pay approach to economically evaluate traffic-relat-
ed air pollution health effects. In all three countries, the total air
pollution related health costs are US$49.7bn?, with $26.7bn
coming from road traffic-related pollution. As a percentage of
GDP, such costs in these countries range from 1.1%-5.8%
(Sommer et al., 1999). A recent study from Sao Paulo
(Miraglia et al., forthcoming), estimated that by 2020, 35300
avoidable deaths from air pollution will occur if current trends
in transportation continue and about 150,000 children will be
admitted to the hospital or visit the emergency room.

public transport could benefit the lower income sections of
society, especially in developing countries, along with associ-

studies show a regressive effect of carbon taxes, but a progres-
sive effect if revenues are returned to disadvantaged groups. As
the share of household expenditure on energy and the depen-
dence on high-carbon fuels of the lower income groups is high,
the impact of a carbon tax would be disproportionately higher
on these lower income groups (Goldemberg and Johansson,

tion on road fuels is weakly progressive. They also show that

lower use of traditional biomass are decreased deforestation, and
lower loss of crop-nutrient from the system through use of agri-
cultural residue as fuel (Bala, 1997). The ancillary environmen-
tal benefits that are associated with such strategies do not form
a major factor in energy decisions of the household (Aacher and

"10 Spillover effects can be defined as interdependencies between
countries, sectors or firms that take the form of technological syner-
gies and flows of stimuli and constraints that do not entirely corre-
spond to commodity flows (Dosi, 1988). The concept originates in the
literature on technical change, in order to account for the non-appro-
priability of scientific and technological knowledge, which reduces
the incentive to private R&D and thus motivates public investment in
R&D (Arrow, 1962).

"These conclusions are confirmed by later studies, although in
general the effects of environmental taxation in one country on
sectors in other countries are not well covered by the literature.
Using an econometric model (E3ME), Barker (1998a) assesses
policies reducing CO, emissions in 11 EU member states at the
level of 30 industries and 17 fuel users, comparing unilateral
with co-ordinated policies. The carbon tax reduces imports of
oil and increases imports of carbon-intensive products.
However, the results for trade are negligible.

petitiveness and hence market shares for sectors in other
countries;

thus give rise to “carbon leakages”;

(4) However, they may also stimulate the development of
alternative technological solutions.

"The rate of international spillovers largely depends on the nature
of the technology, the degree of internalization of the market,
and the competitive structure of the industry. The NEMS model
of the US energy sector is one of the rare models explicitly
incorporating spillover effects. It is assumed, based on historical
experience, that power plant development outside the US will
also help to decrease costs in the USA. Thus, one unit installed
abroad is incorporated in the experience curve, but only up to a
fraction of the same unit in the USA. The corresponding factor
(from 0 to 1) depends on the proximity of the country and firm
developing this power plant. It gives the measure of the expect-
ed international spillover rate (NEMS model documentation,
DOE-EIA; see Kydes, 1999).

"In the sectoral perspective of this chapter, it appears that there
are three routes by which technology policies in one country
affect sectoral development in others (see Section 8.3.2.5 for a
global perspective). First, R&D may increase the knowledge
base and this will benefit every country. Second, increased
“market access” for low-CO, technologies, through niche-mar-
kets or preferential buyback rates in one country may induce a
generic improvement in technology in others. Box 9.3.1
explains how this process can be modelled. Third, domestic
regulations on performance and standards, whether imposed or
voluntary can create a strong signal for foreign industrial com-
petitors (Gruber er al., 1997). For example, the ratio of emis-
sion standards for carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and NO,
for automobiles in the EU relative to those in the US has been
reduced from a factor of more than 3 in the seventies to a fac-
tor 1.5 to 2 in the nineties (Anderson, 1990; IFP, 1998).

"The effects of carbon taxation on international competitiveness
are reviewed by Ekins and Speck (1998) and Barker and
Johnstone (1998). Clearly, a carbon tax will raise the cost of pro-
duction of some sectors of the economy, causing some consumers
to switch from their products to the products of the sectors in
other countries, changing international trade. National losses
(and/or gains) for price competitiveness will be the net sum of the
sectors’ losses (and/or gains) for price competitiveness. The out-
come for a particular sector will depend on the policy instruments
used, how any tax revenue has been recycled, and whether the
exchange rate has adjusted to compensate at the national level.
The conclusions from these surveys are that the reported effects
on international competitiveness are very small, and that at the
firm and sector level, given well-designed policies, there will not
be significant loss of competitiveness from tax-based policies to
achieve targets similar to those of the Kyoto Protocol.

on the costs of mitigation for the USA, show that 80% of pre-
dicted impacts come from choice of assumptions. They find
that four assumptions are critical in leading to lower costs of
mitigation. These are that:

"There are other aspects to spillovers not well captured in exist-
ing models. As energy efficiency is generally higher in Annex
B countries than in the rest of the world, some studies suggest
that relocation of industry to developing regions would
increase global CO, emissions (e.g., Shinozaki et al., 1998).
However, this conclusion would be altered if the relocated
industry used up-to-date technologies rather than the average
technology in developing countries. The international diffusion
of improved technologies in response to CO, constraints is not
captured in existing models and would tend to counteract the
negative environmental aspects of spillovers.

"Ban (1998) assesses the effects of an ad-valorem tax on coal
(20%), oil (10%), and gas (10%) using an applied general equi-
librium model (GTAP) with 12 world regions and 14 industry
sectors. He has three taxation cases, (a) Japan only, (b) OECD
only, and (c) the world, with revenues used to increase govern-
ment expenditure. The results are all shown against a reference
case for 1992. Table 9.9 shows the effects on the industrial out-
put in Japan: the effects are very small when the tax is for
Japan only, but they are even smaller when the taxation is at the
OECD or world level, illustrating the size of the competitive-
ness effects. These results depend critically on the assumptions
adopted as Ban points out.

mentally different treatment of capital equipment and markets.
Top-down studies have tended to suggest that mitigation poli-
cies have economic costs because markets are assumed to
operate efficiently and any policy that impairs this efficiency
will be costly. Bottom-up studies tend to suggest that mitiga-
tion can yield financial and economic benefits, depending on
the adoption of best-available technologies and the develop-
ment of new technologies. Some hybrid models include both
approaches (see Laroui and van Leeuwen, 1995, for an exam-

"The adoption of top-down or bottom-up methods makes a sig-
nificant difference to the results of mitigation studies (see 8.2.1
and 8.2.2 for discussion and results). In top-down studies the
behaviours of the economy, the energy system, and their con-
stituent sectors are analyzed using aggregate data. In bottom-
up studies, specific actions and technologies are modelled at
the level of the energy-using, GHG-emitting equipment, such
as power-generating stations or vehicle engines, and policy
outcomes are added up to find overall results. The top-down
approach leads easily to a consideration of the effects of miti-
gation on different broad sectors of the economy (not just the
energy and capital goods sectors), so that the literature on these
effects tends to be dominated by this approach.

"The main characteristic of CGE models is that they have an
explicit specification of the behaviour of all relevant econom-
ic agents in the economy. In the mitigation applications they
have usually adopted assumptions of optimizing rationality,
free market pricing, constant returns to scale, many firms and
suppliers of factors, and perfect competition in order to provide
a market-clearing equilibrium in all markets. Econometric
models have relied more on time-series data methods to esti-
mate their parameters rather than consensus estimates drawn
from the literature. Results from these models are explained
not only by their assumptions but also by the quality and cov-
erage of their data. It is usually argued that CGE models are
more suitable for describing long-run steady-state behaviour,
while econometric models are more suitable for forecasting the
short-run. However, the models have increasingly incorporated
long-run theory and formal econometric methods, and several
now include a mix of characteristics, from both resource allo-
cation and econometric models; see Jorgenson and Wilcoxen
(1993), McKibbin and Wilcoxen (1993, 1995), Barker and
Gardiner (1996), Barker (1998b) and McKibbin et al. (1999).

"Will, ULIOIIASS, tal sdllGs,
Differences in the reference scenarios lead to differences in the
effects of mitigation policies. Most notably, a reference sce-

mitigation scenarios associated with that reference case may
require much stronger policies to achieve stabilization.

"If any fuel becomes perfectly elastic in supply at a given price
(i.e., the backstop technology), the overall price of energy will
be determined independently of the level of demand, which
will then become the critical determinant of mitigation costs.
Hence, the assumption of a backstop technology strongly
determines mitigation costs. Models without a backstop tech-
nology will tend to estimate higher economic impacts of a car-
bon tax, because they rely completely on conventional fuels, so
that the tax rate has to rise indefinitely to keep carbon concen-
trations constant, to offset the effects of economic growth.
"	Text
"The treatment of technology change is crucial in the macro-
economic modelling of mitigation. The usual means of incor-
porating technical progress in CGE models is through the use
of time trends, as exogenous variables constant across sectors
and over time. These trends give the date of the solution.
Technical progress usually enters the models via two parame-
ters: (i) autonomous energy efficiency (AEEI) (if technical
progress produces savings of energy, then the value share of
energy of total costs will be reduced); and (ii) as changes in
total factor productivity. The implication of this treatment is
that technological progress in the models is assumed to be
invariant to the mitigation policies being considered. If in fact
the policies lead to improvements in technology, then the costs
may be lower then the models suggest.

"Constant returns to scale represent a common assumption on
the economic modelling of climate change. However, in prac-
tice, economies of scale seem to be the rule rather than the
exception. Indeed, there are several reasons for economies of
scale, see Pratten (1988), and Buchanan and Yoon (1994). For
example, many electricity-generating stations benefit from
economies of scale, utilizing a common pool of resources
including fuel supply, equipment maintenance, voltage trans-
formers, and connection to the grid. In spite of this fact, the
impact of the effects of increasing returns and imperfect com-
petition (IC) in the modelling of climate-change strategies has
consistently been neglected in the literature. Most of the glob-
al models, if not all, assume explicitly perfect competition, for
example, see DICE/RICE, G-Cubed, Global 2100, GREEN,
GTEM, WorldScan, and WW.

"There are many different products, skills, equipment, and pro-
duction processes; many important features are missed when
they are necessarily lumped into composite variables and func-
tions. A basic difference among models and their results is the
level of aggregation. Indeed, in practice, different goods have
different energy requirements in production, and therefore any
changes in consumption and production patterns will affect
them differently. Hence, a highly aggregated model will miss
some potentially major interactions between output and energy
use, which is precisely the purpose of the analysis. For exam-
ple, sectoral disaggregation allows the modelling of a shift
towards less energy-intensive sectors, which might reduce the
share of energy in total inputs. In the same way, when a carbon
tax is introduced, it could reduce the estimated costs of abate-
ment by allowing substitution effects of energy-intensive
goods by less energy-intensive goods.
"	Text
"In assessing the effects of mitigation, estimations of price-
induced substitution possibilities between fuels and between
aggregate energy and other inputs can be crucial for model out-
comes. All such substitutions become greater as the time for
adjustment increases. The problem is that estimates of substi-
tution elasticities are usually highly sensitive to model specifi-
cation and choice of sample period. There is little agreement on
the order of magnitude of some of the substitution elasticities,
or even whether they should be positive or negative, e.g., there
is debate whether capital and energy are complements or sub-
stitutes. If energy and capital are complements, then increasing
the price of energy will reduce the demand in production for
both energy and capital, reducing both investment and growth.
Most CGE models consider very different possibilities of sub-
stitution, for example WW, Global 2100, and Nordhaus’s
DICE/RICE models assume capital and labour as substitutes,
while GREEN assumes capital and energy as direct substitutes.

Instead, modellers have only considered the economic impact

nomic impacts. Nevertheless, the potential costs caused by cli-
mate change are likely to be huge (even though some
favourable effects are also expected) regarding: loss of human
well-being, damage to property including agriculture and
forestry, ecosystem loss, and risk of disaster, see Nordhaus
(1991), Cline (1992, Chapter 3), Fankhauser (1995),

some extent by two factors, the difficulties of economists in
valuing environmental impacts, and the scientific uncertainty
of predicting the physical effects of climate change!?.

"Environmental policy to reduce climate change will be eco-
nomically efficient when the incremental cost of emission
reductions is equal in all complying countries. A way of
achieving cost savings in the abatement policy is to allow
emission sources to contract with each other to meet required
emission reductions. In this sense, flexible instruments such as
international emissions trading and JI are more efficient than a
situation in which each country has to achieve its own emission
reduction!. Usually, international emissions trading is mod-
elled as if all countries set the same carbon tax rate, so that
cost-effective emission reductions are advantageous to under-
take in whatever country they arise. Hence, if models consider
economic instruments for environmental regulation, the over-
all cost of controlling emissions should be lower as a conse-
quence of cost savings in the control produced by these instru-
ments!®,

"Carbon taxes will generate significant tax revenues. The effects
of these revenues in the economy will depend on how this
money is recycled into the economy (in practical terms, some
mechanism for recycling is always needed in order to avoid a
general deflationary impact). If it is assumed that revenues will
not be fully recycled, the models tend to find that any carbon
tax will reduce GDP. Usually, modellers have tried to separate
the economic impacts arising from this environmental policy
from those arising from a tax cut, assuming that revenues will
be returned in the form of lump-sum rebates (an unrealistic
assumption). The alternative is to assume that revenues col-
lected from the carbon tax are used in correcting economic dis-
tortions in the economy, e.g., taxation of employment, which
would benefit society not only by correcting the externality but
also by reducing the costs of the distorting taxes (the so-called
“double dividend’). Obviously, if the benefits from reducing
existing taxes on labour are incorporated into the modelling,
the projected economic impacts can be substantially more opti-
mistic than if a lump-sum revenue recycling is assumed,

to which employment growth in the industries that
would benefit from climate change policies (e.g.,
renewable energy) would offset the decrease in
employment in industries that would suffer as the result
of climate change policies (e.g., fossil fuels). These
studies could also consider frictional unemployment.

More generally, an assessment is needed of how sec-
toral costs of mitigation can be minimized and distrib-
uted more equitably, both at the national and the global
levels. Babiker et a/. (2000) found that macroeconom-
ic costs for the US increased when climate change poli-
cies excluded one or more economic sectors. However,
this study did not indicate the benefits, if any, to the
protected sector.

policies (reductions in air pollution, lower levels of
traffic congestion, fewer road crashes).

Additional research on the impacts of climate change

policies on the fossil fuel industries is needed.

Questions include:

¢ the apparent anomaly between studies indicating
significant decreases in the demand for oil in Annex
B countries, and studies indicating significant
increases in the demand for transportation fuels, the
major user of oil;

¢ whether in the medium term (10 to 30 years)
reserves of conventional oil are limited, which
would soften the impact of climate change policies,
or whether they are plentiful; and

¢ whether the demand for natural gas will decrease as
a result of a general decrease in the demand for fos-
sil fuels, or increase, as a result of fuel switching
from higher carbon content fuels and growth in
demand in non-Annex B countries.

The impacts of climate change policies on the financial
industries have not been analyzed. IPCC (2001) details
the potential impacts, positive and negative, of climate
change on the financial industries, but there appears to
be no literature evaluating the degree to which mitiga-
tion policies would affect these impacts.

The applicability of existing climate policies, and their
impacts on the aviation industry and the shipping
industry have not been adequately studied. Further
analysis is needed to determine the efficiency, effec-
tiveness, and equity of various policy options, particu-
larly involving taxation, on limiting GHG emissions
from aviation and shipping. This would include the dif-
ficulties involved in changing the current treaty struc-
ture to allow for the taxation of aviation fuel. The
International Maritime Organization is studying GHG
emissions from shipping. The International Civil
Aviation Organization is currently analyzing policy
options for aviation and is expected to complete its
evaluation by September, 2001.

"	Title
"Scope for and New Developments in Analyses for Climate
Change Decisions
"	Text
"Climate change is profoundly different from most other envi-
ronmental problems with which humanity has grappled. A
combination of several features gives the climate problem its
unique feature, which include:
"	Text
"Government structures involved in the decision-making
process vary considerably among countries. Institutional artic-
ulation remains one of the critical factors affecting the consol-
idation of an effective decision-making process related to sus-
"	Text
"paths that satisfy externally defined climate impact and emis-
sion cost constraints. Results indicate that a delay in near-term
effective emission reductions can drastically reduce the future
range of options for relatively tight climate change targets.
Less tight targets offer more near-term flexibility.

public good issues that arise from the concentration of
greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere (and
require collective global action);

the multiplicity of decision makers (ranging from glob-
al decision-making frameworks (DMFs) down to the
micro-level of firms and individuals);

the heterogeneity of emissions; and

the consequences of emissions around the world.
"	List
"Moreover, the long-term nature of climate change originates
because it is the concentration of GHGs that is important,
rather than annual emissions; this feature raises the thorny
issues of intergenerational transfers of wealth and environmen-
tal good and bad outcomes. Next, human activities associated
with climate change are so widespread that narrowly defined
technological solutions are impossible and the interactions of
climate policy with other broad socioeconomic policies are
strong. Finally, large uncertainties or in some areas even igno-
rance characterize many aspects of the problem and require a
risk management approach to be adopted in all DMFs that deal
with climate change.
"	Text
"There is therefore a three-way relationship between the design
of the international regime, the cost-efficiency of climate poli-
cies, and the equity of the consequent economic outcomes.
Thus, it is crucial to design the international regime in a way
that increases both its efficiency and its equity. The literature
presents different strategies to optimize an international
regime. For example, countries can be encouraged to partici-
pate in an international group committed to specific emissions
limits and targets if the equity (and therefore efficiency) is
increased by a larger agreement. This may include measures
like an appropriate distribution of targets over time, the linkage
of the climate debate with other issues (“issue linkage“), the
use of financial transfers to affected countries (“side pay-
ments”), and technology transfer agreements.
"	Text
"Different mitigation policy options include the timing of
responses to climate change, the choice between mitigation and
adaptation responses, the role of technological innovation and
diffusion, the choice between domestic action and the adoption
of international mechanisms, the combination of climate
change mitigation with actions towards other environmental or
socio-economic objectives, and others. The costs and benefits
of these crucially depend on the characteristics of the interna-
tional agreement on climate change that is adopted. In particu-
lar, they depend upon two main features of the international
regime: the number of signatories, and the size of their quanti-
tative commitment to control GHG emissions. The number of
signatories depends on how equitably the commitments of the
participants are shared. Cost-effectiveness (minimizing costs by
maximizing participation) and equity (the allocation of emis-
sions limitation commitments) are therefore strongly linked.
"	Text
"Experiments with cost—benefit models framed as a Bayesian
decision-analysis problem show that optimal near-term (next
two decades) emission paths diverge only modestly with per-
fect foresight and even with hedging for low-probability, high-
consequence scenarios. Cost-effectiveness analyses seek the
lowest cost that will achieve an environmental target by equal-
izing the marginal costs of mitigation across space and time.
Long-term cost-effectiveness studies estimate the costs to sta-
bilize atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO,) concentrations at dif-
ferent levels. While there is a moderate increase in the costs
when passing from a 750 ppmv to a 550 ppmv concentration
stabilization level, there is a larger increase in costs passing
from 550 ppmv to 450 ppmvy unless the emissions in the base-
line scenario are very low. The total costs of stabilizing atmos-
pheric carbon concentrations are very dependent on the base-
line scenario: for example, for scenarios focusing on the local
and regional aspects of sustainable development costs are
lower than for other scenarios. Rather than seeking a single
optimal path, the tolerable windows or safe landing approach-
es seek to delineate the complete array of possible emission

"Key Policy-relevant Scientific Questions
"	Title
"In principle, costs of near-term emission reductions could be
reduced by using international flexibility mechanisms to real-
ize reductions where they are least expensive. While there is a
broad agreement on the cost-reducing effect of international
flexibility mechanisms, there are concerns about their implica-
tions for incentives to technological development as well as
"	Text
"sive technological facilities, but less effort was applied to the
digestion, absorption, and innovation of the introduced tech-
nologies. Information can play a guiding role in technology
transfer. To enable sound decision-making, the up-to-date
information on the current status of technology research and
development, the technical and economic evaluation of tech-
nologies, and the sources of technologies should be available.
"	Text
"Answers to policy-relevant scientific questions need to draw
on the vast material presented in this volume. These questions
are concerned with the best possible current action with a view
to a huge array of possible futures. Decisions need to be made
regarding the short-term balance of various types of actions
(mitigation, adaptation, information acquisition), their timing
(in absolute terms and relative to each other), their location (of
mainly mitigation activities), the character and content of inter-
national agreements, and the mode and broader policy context
of implementation.
"	Text
"tainable development. Even if rules and regulations exist to
assign competence, tasks, and responsibilities among the insti-
tutions involved, a considerable gap exists between what might
be desirable and what, for the most part, is practised. In this
context, policies related to sustainable development are no
longer seen as a hierarchical, government-controlled chain of
commands, but rather as an open process in which the princi-
ples of “good governance’—transparency, participation, plural-
ism, and accountability—become the key elements of the deci-
sion-making process.
"	Text
"Options to mitigate climate change include actual emission
reductions and CO, sequestration, investments in developing
technologies that will make future reductions cheap relative to
their current costs, institutional and regulatory changes to mod-
ify current decisions that distort in favour of GHG-emitting
action, and others. Their relative weight in an optimal near-
term portfolio of mitigation actions crucially depends on the
assumptions behind the various mitigation-cost estimates and
about the preconditions and future availability of inexpensive
technologies. Estimates of costs of drastic near-term reductions
tend to be high, but the proper way to encourage technological
development remains heavily debated.
"	Text
"Striking the appropriate balance between mitigation and adap-
tation will be a tedious process. The need for, extent, and costs
of adaptation measures in any region will be determined by the
magnitude and nature of the regional climate change driven by
shifts in global climate. How global climate change unfolds
will be determined by the total amount of GHG emissions that,
in turn, reflects nations’ willingness to undertake mitigation
measures. Balancing mitigation and adaptation efforts largely
depends on how mitigation costs are related to net damages
(primary or gross damage minus damage averted through adap-
tation plus costs of adaptation). Both mitigation costs and net
damages, in turn, depend on some crucial baseline assump-
tions: economic development and baseline emissions largely
determine emission reduction costs, while development and
institutions influence vulnerability and adaptive capacity.

"The private sector has played an important role in the develop-

reduce the emission of GHGs, and it is becoming increasingly
active in developing and transferring renewable energy tech-

ment (R&D) institutions on their own or jointly with other
research centres to provide support to technological innovation
and the integration of production and research. On the supply
side, the government can play an important role in R&D and
creating an enabling environment for technology transfer.
While introducing technologies to mitigate and adapt to cli-
mate change, the developing countries should consider that the
introduction of such technology could generate economic ben-

"Acritical requirement of sustainable development is the capac-
ity to design policy measures that exploit potential synergies
between national economic growth objectives and environ-
mentally focused policies without hindering development and
in accordance with national strategies. As also discussed in
Chapters 1 and 2, climate change mitigation strategies offer a
clear example of co-ordinated and harmonized policies that
take advantage of the synergies between the implementation of
mitigation options and broader objectives. The potential link-
ages between climate change mitigation issues and economic
and social aspects have also brought an important shift in the
focus of mitigation analysis literature. The three perspectives
introduced in Chapter 1 (cost-effectiveness, equity and sustain-
ability) illustrate this shift and broaden the array of options, for
example by including options for institutional and behavioural
changes. From being confined to project-by-project or sector-
based approaches, analyses and studies are increasingly con-
cerned with the use of broader policy issues as mechanisms to
reduce GHG emissions. Thus the alternative energy paths of
low carbon futures in developing countries can be compatible
with national objectives. Although environmental concerns,
and climate change issues in particular, were not explicitly
addressed by macroeconomic and sectoral policies, analyzed
country cases show clear synergies between reform policies
and environmental improvements. It is also important to under-
line that for the elements that make up policies at different lev-
els to operate in a mutually reinforcing manner, the creation of
appropriate communication and information channels should

"DMFs relevant to the climate problem have several levels.
They stretch from global and supranational fora through
national and regional institutions down to the micro-level of
companies, families, and individuals. At each level, it is useful
to distinguish two parts of these DMFs: institutions that pro-
vide the boundary conditions (jurisdictions, procedural rules,
the body of earlier agreements, etc.) and processes that fall
within these frameworks (negotiations, lobbying, persuasion).
At the global level, for example, UNFCCC provides the insti-

DMF.

"The third domain is process-analysis frameworks (PAFs),
which involve assessments of the decision-making process and
provide guidance for decision making in two main areas. The
first is concerned with institutional framework design, that is
how to build policy regimes that address the problem effec-
tively (Victor et al., 1998; Young, 1999). The second looks at
procedures of decision making at various levels. The bulk of
the literature on climate change addresses global regime-build-

procedure analysis (Kremenyuk, 1991). Pertinent lessons from
this literature are assessed in Section 10.2.

beginning of this chapter. Toth (2000) proposes a simple
scheme to make a clear distinction to recognize the fine bor-

accumulate to determine global aggregates, it is united by a
global focus, common to all of the work discussed in the sec-

within their own jurisdictions. DAFs organize climate-relevant
information in a suitable framework, apply a decision criterion
(based on some paradigms or theories), and identify options
that are better than others under the assumptions that charac-

broad range of DAFs has been used to provide substantial

Multiplicity of decision makers also implies that there are lim-

levels—-global governmental organizations, nation states,
regional governments, private individuals, multinational firms,
local enterprises—all matter. The global nature of the problem
also implies that the full breadth of human social structures is
encompassed. This in turn implies that a diversity of policy
responses is needed. Policy responses that are effective and

"Climate change is related to the concentration of GHGs and not
to any individual year’s emissions. Carbon dioxide (CO,) con-
centrations are closely related to the net accumulation of emis-
sions over long periods of time. That is, it is the sum of emis-
sions over time that determines the atmospheric concentration.
Any individual year’s emissions are only marginally impor-
tant!. Average residence times for GHGs can range up to thou-
sands of years for some of the anthropogenic species.
Strategies to control net emissions must account for long peri-
ods of time in a meaningful way. The ultimate objective of the
UNFCCC is the “stabilization of GHG concentrations in the
atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthro-
pogenic interference with the climate system” (UNFCCC
1993, Article 2).

"Traditional environmental air-pollution problems have been
amenable to local solutions. The dirty air in a North American
city is of no direct consequence to a city in New Zealand. With
climate change it is the emissions of all sources in all nations
that determine the concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs)
in the atmosphere. As a consequence, the climate change prob-
lem is inherently a public goods problem. That is, the climate
that everyone enjoys is the product of everyone’s behaviour.
No single individual or nation can determine the composition
of the world’s atmosphere. Any individuals’ or nations’ actions
to address the climate change issue, even the largest emitting
nation acting alone, can have only a small effect. As a conse-
quence, individuals and nations acting independently will pro-
vide, together, fewer resources than all individuals and nations
would if they acted in concert. This characteristic provides an
important motivation for collective, global action.

Emissions and consequences are also heterogeneous around
the world. This exacerbates the basic public goods nature of the
problem. Countries are distributed across a spectrum of high
emitters to low emitters and high impacts to low impacts.
Nations with high emissions and low expected impacts have a
high potential to control concentrations, but little incentive. On
the other hand, nations with low emissions and high impacts
have great incentive to control emissions, but little capability.
While side payments could, in principle, resolve this dilemma,
transaction costs may be significant and the present income
distributions may lead to unacceptable outcomes. Furthermore,
most of the people who will be directly affected by the prob-
lem have not been born yet, which limits their ability to nego-
tiate. Both emissions and the capability to mitigate carbon
emissions to the atmosphere are unevenly distributed around
the world. A dozen countries control 95% of conventional car-

The consequences of climate change will be visited primarily
on those who are alive in the future. The present generation has
inherited its atmosphere and associated climate from its ances-
tors. While individuals and governments make many decisions
that affect future generations, most of these decisions are under-
taken inadvertently. It is impossible to avoid the intergenera-
tional wealth-transfer issue when addressing the climate prob-
lem. That most of the affected parties are not present to partic-
ipate in the decision-making process raises complicated ethical
questions. The implications of their absence are not immediate-
ly obviously. Future generations have a stake both in the envi-
ronmental resources, such as climate, that they inherit, and in
other wealth that is passed down to them. Sacrifices that are
made by the present generation for the good of its descendants
will alter the composition of wealth (e.g., environmental versus
material) that is transferred from the present to the future, as
well as the magnitude of the transfer. As climate change is
anticipated to be greater in the future than it is at present, those
who live in the future will reap most of the benefits that accrue
to near-term actions to limit emissions. Intergenerational asym-
metry can lead to a form of public goods problem in which the
willingness to undertake emissions mitigation in the near-term
may be less than would have been the case if the decision mak-
ers lived infinitely. Also implied is a greater sensitivity to emis-
sion-limitation costs than would be the case if the present gen-
eration lived to benefit from its emissions-mitigation actions.

Future emissions depend to a large degree on the rate and
direction of technological developments in a broad array of
human endeavours. For example, China’s policies to stabilize
its population size, taken for reasons unrelated to climate
change, will have a profound effect on Chinese emissions of
GHGs to the atmosphere. Policies to control non-GHG air pol-
lutants can greatly affect GHG emissions. For example, mea-
sures to substitute natural gas and non-carbon-emitting energy
forms, such as solar and nuclear power, for coal in electricity
generation to control local and regional air pollution can affect
GHG emissions as well. On the other hand, some policies that

Energy is the single largest source of GHG emissions. It is
responsible for approximately 80% of net carbon emissions to
the atmosphere. While net emissions of carbon are associated
with fossil fuel combustion, the carbon-to-energy ratio varies
between high-carbon fuels, such as coal, and low-carbon fuels,
such as CH,, approximately by a factor of two. Technologies
such as hydroelectric power, nuclear fission, wind power, and
solar power are generally treated as if they have little or no
direct carbon emissions, though this may not be the case. For
example, CH, may be released in the process of creating a
hydroelectric facility and carbon may be released in the manu-
facture of cement used in nuclear power reactors. Technologies
do exist that can biologically sequester or physically remove
and store carbon. Thus, in principle, controlling energy-related
carbon emissions is possible for several sources of carbon
emissions without foregoing fossil fuel use. These technolo-
gies are discussed in Chapter 3.

"presently understood. While non-CO, GHGs with relatively
short life times, such as methane (CH,), have an atmospheric
concentration that is stable with a stable rate of annual emis-
sion, CO, does not. The cumulative net introduction of carbon
emissions from terrestrial reservoirs, such as fossil fuels or bio-
logical carbon, through (for example) energy production and
use or land-use change, determines the long-term, steady state,
atmospheric CO, concentration. Carbon cycle models require
net emissions to asymptotically approach zero, though the
process can take centuries. Most, but not all, emissions scenar-
ios anticipate that, in the absence of a concern for climate
change, future GHG emissions will continue to rise rather than
fall (PCC, 2000b). Where reference emissions scenarios
exhibit increasing emissions over time, most of the emissions
mitigation required to stabilize the concentration of carbon
must occur in the future, with the deviation from the profile
required for stabilization growing with time.

a result of differences in values and objectives, parties
that participate in a collective decision-making process

decisions for actions under the UNFCCC are rather
being taken sequentially to benefit from the gradual
reduction in uncertainties;

countries may implement a portfolio of mitigation,
adaptation, and research measures;

they may adjust this portfolio continuously in response
to new knowledge (the value of better information is
potentially very large); and

efficient distribution of the risks of losses related to cli-
mate change may warrant new insurance mechanisms.

"Much work has been conducted since SAR. Work has focused
on a wide array of issues ranging from that which explores the
tools of analysis to that which employs those tools to shed light
on the problem of climate change. Researchers such as De
Canio (1997), De Canio and Laitner (1997), De Canio et al.
(2000a, 2000b, 2000c), Laitner and Hogan (2000), Laitner et
al. (2000), Peters and Brassel (2000), and Sanstad er al.
(2000a, 2000b) have focused on integrated assessment,
endogenous technological change, and behavioural, social, and
organizational phenomena (discussed in Chapter 8). Work has
also continued to examine the problems of cost-benefit, cost-
effectiveness, and the interaction of uncertainty with decision
making. New approaches have also been developed, including,
for example, tolerable windows and safe landing.

"actions rationally. Quantitative comparisons among
decision options (and their attributes) are implied by
choices between options (the concept of “revealed pref-
erence” in economics). Better decisions are made when
these quantitative comparisons are explicit rather than
implicit.

The treatment of uncertainty in decision analysis is
quite powerful, but the probabilities of uncertain deci-
sion outcomes must be quantifiable. In climate change,
objective probabilities have not been established for
many of the outcomes. In real-world applications sub-
jective probabilities are used.

The large uncertainties and differences between parties
may mean there can be no “globally” optimal climate-
change strategy; nevertheless, the factors that affect the
optimal strategies for single decision makers still have
relevance to individual parties.
"	List
"Work has continued in the development of tools to understand
the influence of uncertainty on decision making. The initial
work examined in SAR explores the problem of emissions-mit-
igation objectives under a cost-effectiveness framework, but
the interaction between concentration limits and the date at
which uncertainty is resolved influences the results. This inter-
action occurs because in decision analysis no option can ever
be foreclosed before the date at which uncertainty is hypothe-
sized to be resolved. Any concentration ceiling implies a cumu-
lative emissions limit. Thus preserving the option to stay below
any arbitrary limit means adopting a hedging strategy. Grubb
(1997) characterizes the problem thus: “If we delay action in
the belief that we are aiming at a SOOppmv target, for example,
then after a couple of decades it may be simply too late to be
able to stabilize at 400ppmv, however urgent the problem then
turns out to be; and even stabilization at 450ppmv might by
then involve radical changes of direction that could prove eco-
nomically very disruptive.”

Excessive knowledge requirements in negotiated envi-
ronmental decisions may impede a collective rational
choice. This difficulty could be reduced by making the
negotiation process itself more manageable through the
use of tools like stakeholder analysis or by splitting
accords into more easily managed clusters of agree-
ments.

In the face of long-term uncertainties, sequential deci-
sion-making allows actions to be better matched to out-
comes by incorporating additional information over
time. Sequential decision-making also minimizes
harmful strategic behaviour among multiple decision
makers.

Improved information about uncertain outcomes may
have very high economic value, especially if that infor-
mation can create future decision options.

There are currently no effective mechanisms for shar-
ing the risks related to climate change and their associ-
ated economic burdens. International risk sharing could
yield substantial benefits for global economic and
social welfare.

"There have been several attempts to frame the issue. Figure
10.1 reports the results of an analysis by Ha-Duong ef al.
(1997). The authors use their model of the Dynamics of Inertia
and Adaptability for integrated assessment of climate-change
Mitigation (DIAM) to determine the least-cost emission path-
way given an uncertain concentration target. A defining feature
of their model is an inertia parameter that accounts for the time
scale of change in the global energy system. In their analysis
they assign equal probability to a target of 450, 550, and
650ppmv. The solid 550ppmvy line corresponds to the optimal
pathway when the target is known to be 550ppmv from the out-
set. The analysis shows the optimal hedging strategy when
uncertainty is not resolved until 2020. The authors note that
“our results show that abatement over the next few years is
economically valuable if there is a significant probability of
having to stay below ceilings that would be otherwise reached
within the characteristic time scales of the systems producing
greenhouse gases.”

"One way to avoid the bias inherent in the framing of the emis-
sions control problem under uncertainty is to reframe the prob-
lem as a decision tree structure within the context of cost—ben-
efit analysis rather than cost-effectiveness analysis. This was
the approach taken by the seven models used in an Energy
Modeling Forum (EMF; Manne, 1995) exercise on climate
change decision making under uncertainty (Weyant, 1997).
The study focused on hedging strategies for low probability,
high consequence scenarios in which uncertainty was not
resolved until 2020. Two parameters were varied: the mean
temperature sensitivity factor and the cost of damages associ-
ated with global warming. The unfavourable cases were
defined as the top 5% of each of these two distributions. Two
surveys of expert opinion were used to choose the distribution
of these variables. For the opinion survey on climate sensitivi-
ty, see Morgan and Keith (1995), and for warming damages,
see Nordhaus (1994b). Figure 10.2 (Manne and Richels, 1995;
Manne 1995) shows what happens when the unfavourable case
has a probability of 0.5 and the expected case a probability of
0.95 (the two parameter values assumed for the unfavourable
case are shown in the surveys cited above as being in the upper
5% of each of the distributions of the two key parameters, i.e.,
climate sensitivity and climate damages). The dashed lines
show what happens if perfect foresight is available and can
make today’s decisions in the full knowledge of which of these
outcomes will occur. The solid lines indicate the average
results from an economically efficient hedging strategy. The
analysis takes into account both the costs and benefits of emis-
sions abatement. With a cost-benefit analysis, costs and bene-
fits are balanced at the margin. Seven EMF modelling teams
have confirmed these results (Weyant, 1997). The reason for
so little hedging is the low probability of the extreme outcome,

desired degree of hedging would increase accordingly.

depend on whether the steepness of the marginal abatement

"Another parameter for stochastic cost-benefit analysis is the
importance of non-linearity in the impacts and the date at
which some threshold is likely to occur. Peck and Tiesberg
(1993) observed that optimal policies were more sensitive to
uncertainty in the damage-function power parameter than to
uncertainty in the scale parameter. Ha-Duong et al. (1999) con-
firm this view and demonstrate that introducing thresholds in
the damage function leads to more significant decoupling from
current emissions trends for a given probability distribution.
"	Text
"Whatever the approach, the basic message is quite similar. First
the costs and benefits of quick action have to be balanced
against those of delayed action; second, to assume that the con-
centration target is known with certainty is an over-simplifica-
tion of the decision problem. What is needed is an approach
that explicitly incorporates uncertainty and its sequential reso-
lution over time. The desirable amount of hedging should
depend upon assessment of the stakes, the odds, and the costs
of policy measures. The risk premium — the amount that soci-
ety is willing to pay to reduce risk — ultimately is a political
decision that differs among countries.

"Both Manne and Richels (1997) and Edmonds et al. (1997)
examined the relationship between steady-state concentrations
of CO, and associated minimum costs. Both papers computed
the minimum cost of honouring a concentration ceiling. All
cost calculations assumed that all activities throughout the
world pursued emissions mitigation based on a common mar-
ginal cost of carbon emissions mitigation. While real-world
implementation strategies are likely to be less efficient, the
choice of a cost-effective assumption for each period provides
a unique benchmark for comparison purposes. Several assump-
tions regarding cost-effectiveness over time were examined.
The two studies examined three cases:

"Uncertainty also affects the choice of policy instrument. In
principle many mechanisms can be employed to limit emis-
sions, including, voluntary agreements among domestic and
international parties, regulation, taxes, subsidies, and quotas or
tradable permits (see Chapter 6). Economists have focused on
the potential role of taxes and quotas because these tools hold
potential for cost minimization. Although both instruments are
equivalent in a world with complete information (the optimal
quota leads to the same marginal abatement cost as the optimal
tax level), Pizer (1999), building upon a seminal work by
Weizman (1974), demonstrated that this is not the case if
uncertainties about climate damage and GHG abatement costs
are considered.
"	Text
"Hence the finding that a co-ordination through price is prefer-
able as long as the probability of dramatic non-linearity in cli-
mate systems is not large over the middle term. This policy
conclusion can be reverted if the transaction costs of adopting
co-ordinated taxation, high level of risk-aversion to cata-
strophic events, or a large amount of “no regrets” policies are
considered. The main message, however, is that in a tax co-
ordination approach costs are observable (while the outcome is
not predictable), but in a quota approach the outcome is
observable although there is an uncertainty about the resultant
costs. In this respect, emissions trading is logically a compan-
ion tool for a system of emissions quotas, to hedge against the
distributional implications of surprises regarding abatement
costs and emissions baselines.
"	Text
"Ultimately, as recognized in the IPCC (1996c) one should try
and assess the option value of the information incorporated in
alternative emissions pathways, that is the capacity of society
to adapt to any new information. As pointed out by Ulph and
Ulph (1997), the environmental irreversibility has to be bal-
anced against the technological irreversibility, including the
crowding out between forms of technical progress. Ha-Duong
(1998) finds, comparing Working Group I (WGI) and Wigley,
Richels, Edmonds (WRE) strategies, that the magnitude of the
value of information is significant compared with the opportu-
nity costs of abatement. On the basis of nine scenarios he found
that the information value of acting soon is, for most of them,
higher than that of acting later, if low and high damages are
assumed equally probable.

"There is an increased interest in cost-minimizing paths that
lead to alternative, stable steady-state concentrations of GHGs
in the atmosphere. This interest stems from the objective of the
UNFCCC-to stabilize the concentration of GHGs. Work has
focused primarily on the problem of stabilizing the concentra-
tion of CO,. The focus on CO, reflects the importance placed
on this gas by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
Working Group I (IPCC WGI) and the distinctive characteris-
tic of CO,. As CO, does not have an atmospheric sink, the net
emissions to the atmosphere must eventually decline indefi-
nitely to maintain any steady-state concentration (IPCC,
1996a). In contrast, GHGs such as CH, and N,O, with atmos-
pheric sinks, have steady-state concentrations associated with
steady-state emissions. Cost-effective paths depend on many
factors including reference emissions, technical options for
emissions limitation, the timing and rate of change of the avail-
ability of options, the discount rate, and assumed control mech-
anisms and their efficiency. The analysis conducted to date
generally does not take into account that long-term emissions
mitigation must take place against a background of climate
change that affects both the nature and composition of eco-
nomic activity and the carbon cycle.

of interest plus the rate of carbon removal, approximately

marginal cost.

"Jacoby et al. (1998) also considered the problem of accession
to the Kyoto Protocol. They reject the idea that there is such a
thing as inter-temporal cost-effectiveness in the context of a
century-scale problem. Rather, they begin with the proposition
that a continuous process of negotiation and re-negotiation is
required. They analyze a system of obligations based on per-
capita income that can lead to the stabilization of concentra-
tions of GHGs.
"	Text
"All cost-effective policies minimize the cost of stabilization by
equalizing the marginal cost of mitigation across time and
space, that is, in all regions, across all human activities, and
across all generations, except to the extent that non-linearities,
non-convexities, and comer solutions exist. The implementa-
tion of real-world regimes to control net emissions to the
atmosphere is likely to be inefficient to some degree for a num-
ber of reasons, including, for example, the problems of “free
riding”; cheating; in some cases considerations of fairness and
equity; and monitoring, compliance, and transactions costs.

"Progress has also been made in examining the time path of the
value of a tonne of carbon when the cost of stabilizing the con-
centration of CO, is minimized. Peck and Wan (1996) demon-
strated that the results of Hotelling (1931) could be applied to
the problem of minimizing the cost to stabilize the concentra-
tion of CO, and generalized. They show that to minimize pre-
sent discounted cost, the value of a tonne of carbon should rise
at the rate of interest (discount rate). This theorem ensures that
the marginal cost of emissions mitigation across both space
and time is equal after taking into account that carbon is natu-
rally removed from the system. Thus, the initial marginal costs

"Costs are roughly an order of magnitude greater for concentra-
tion ceilings of 450ppmv than for the 750ppmv ceiling
between WGI, WRE, and optimal global emissions constraints.
Furthermore, costs decline sharply as the constraint is relaxed
from 450ppmv to 550ppmv. Relaxation of the constraint from
650ppmv to 750ppmv reduces costs, but at a more modest rate.
As discussed in Chapters 2, 7 and 8, it should be noted that the
total costs of stabilizing atmospheric carbon concentrations are
very dependent on the baseline scenario: for example, for sce-
narios focusing on the local and regional aspects of sustainable
development costs are lower than for other scenarios.

"Some work has been undertaken to compare potential policy
regimes with respect to cost-effectiveness. For example,
Chapter 8 shows the difference in emissions mitigation require-
ments between various potential implementations of the Kyoto
Protocol and more cost-effective paths. Edmonds and Wise
(1998) examined the cost effectiveness of a strategy that sought
to minimize the costs of monitoring and verification, and pre-
mature retirement of capital stocks, while simultaneously
addressing concerns about fairness and equity. They considered
a hypothetical protocol that focused on new investments in
energy technology. They assumed that Annex | nations required
new emissions sources to be carbon-neutral after a prescribed
date. Existing sources were treated as new after a fixed period
following their initial deployment. Non-Annex I nations
remained unencumbered until their incomes reached levels
comparable to those in Annex I nations. The authors concluded
that the regulatory regime could stabilize the concentration of
GHGs, and that the level at which concentrations stabilized is
determined by the initial date of obligations. The hypothetical
protocol is economically inefficient, however. That is, it does
not minimize the cost of achieving a concentration limit. The
authors compare the hypothetical protocol, which uses a tech-
nology regulation to limit emissions, with an alternative cap-
and-trade regime that achieved the same emissions path. Costs
in the hypothetical protocol were approximately 30% greater
than in those in the alternative cap-and-trade regime.

region or sector on the impact side). Alternatively, willingness
to pay for emission reductions can be increased or more cost-
reducing flexibility instruments can be allowed on the mitiga-
tion side. If the corridor does exist, it can be perceived as the
room to manoeuvre for global climate policy over the long
term. The tolerable windows approach leaves the specification
of climate-change mitigation regimes up to decision makers
involved in climate-change policy making at the global and
national levels. The primary goal of the ICLIPS integrated
assessment model (IAM) is to determine the implications of
different equity principles in burden sharing and of various
implementation mechanisms on the existence and shape of the
emission corridor. Nevertheless, the model can also produce
cost-effective emission paths.

"Considerable work since the SAR has explored the implica-
tions for global emissions of GHGs of a set of constraints on a
variety of associated phenomena. This vein of research is
referred to as the tolerable windows and/or safe landing
(TWSL) approach. See, for example, Alcamo and Kreileman
(1996a, 1996b) and Swart et al. (1998) for early work on the
safe landing approach and Toth et al. (1997) for early work on
the tolerable windows approach. The approach seeks to limit
the emissions time-paths with implications for the near term
and long term. While the tolerable windows and safe landing
analyses differ somewhat in the detail of their implementation,
they are similar in approach. We consider the safe landing
approach first. In a multimodel exercise four constraints on
emissions trajectories are considered: temperature change
since 1990, maximum decadal rate of temperature change, sea
level rise between 1990 and 2100, and maximum rate of sea
level change. In addition, a limit on the rate of reduction of
emissions is set.
"	Text
"Results from the analysis depend strongly on the constraints
and model sensitivities. The tolerable windows approach (Toth
et al., 1997, 1999; Bruckner et al., 1999; Petschel-Held et al.,
1999) is formulated as a type of extended and generalized
cost-benefit analysis for which two kinds of normative inputs
are required. First, with the help of climate-impact response
functions that depict reactions of climate-sensitive socioeco-
nomic and natural systems to climate change forcing, social
actors can specify their willingness to accept a certain amount
of climate change in their own jurisdiction. Second, the same
social actors reveal their willingness to pay for climate change
mitigation in terms of acceptable burden-sharing principles and
implementation schemes internationally, as well as in terms of
tolerable utility, consumption, or Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) loss in their own jurisdiction. An integrated climate-
economy model (e.g., Integrated Assessment of Climate
Protection Strategies - ICLIPS) can then determine whether
there exists a corridor of emission paths over time that keeps
the climate system within the permitted domain.

their per capita emissions reach those of Annex I levels on the

"Figure 10.4(a) presents the basic emission corridor for the
WBGU window. It follows from the mathematical formulation
of the model that at least one permitted emission path passes
through any arbitrary point in the corridor. However, not every
arbitrary path within the corridor is necessarily a permitted
path. If emissions follow the upper boundary of the corridor in
the first few decades after 1995, for example, this would entail
a sharp turnaround and persistent emission reductions at the
maximum annual rate (4%/yr) for many decades to come.

the global climate window as specified by the Council. It is
beyond the scope of this analysis to discuss arguments for and
against whether the 2°C increase in global mean temperature
above the pre-industrial level and the rate of temperature
increase at no more than 0.2°C per decade are preferred or
realistic propositions. The objective for the tolerable windows
approach is to provide an assessment framework that can help
test any climate protection proposal formulated through
selected climate attributes. The computed emission corridors,
nevertheless, can assist in deciding the magnitude and urgency
of the policy measures associated with them, and/or trigger
rethinking the originally proposed climate change targets. The
presented example also shows how equity concerns can be
analyzed in the tolerable windows approach, albeit in a terse

a powerful synthesis between the narrative, process-oriented
methods of scenario-based planning (Schwartz, 1996; van der

game theory, and portfolio analysis. From the quantitative meth-
ods, multiscenario simulation draws systematic methods of han-
dling large quantities of data and normative descriptions of good
decisions. From scenario-planning, multiscenario simulation
draws the insight that multiple views of the future are crucial to
allow groups to transmit and receive information about highly
uncertain futures. Also scenario planning shows that groups can
often agree on actions to take in the face of deep uncertainty
without agreeing on the reasons for these actions (Lempert and
Schlesinger, 2000). For instance, multiscenario simulation can
adopt a meaningful cost-benefit framework for climate change,
but at the same time acknowledge the deep uncertainty and dif-
fering values among stakeholders. These make it impossible to
fully quantify the costs and benefits or to assign widely accept-
ed probabilities to many of the key outcomes of interest. Such

been devoted to the questions (Wynne, 1994). The starting point
is the acknowledgement that uncertainty emerges not only from
the long time-scales involved and/or the ability of models to
predict long-term events, but mainly from the endemic uncer-
tainty, indeterminacy, and ignorance related to the co-evolution
of natural and social systems. Furthermore, these methods
stress the relevance of values, ethical and social, and thus intro-

uncertainty has been addressed by van Asselt and Rotmans
(1997) within the framework of the Tool to Assess Regional and
Global Environmental and health Targets for Sustainability

routes—a chain of biased interpretations of the crucial uncertain-
ties in the model-to analyze differences in future projections as
the outcome of divergent views and valuations, instead of mere-
ly of low, high, and medium values. The approach distinguishes
two dimensions of perspectives: (1) a world view, which entails
a coherent view of how the world functions, and (2) a manage-
ment style, that is policy preferences and strategies. By combin-
ing stereotypical views of nature and humanity as well as ethical
attitudes with different management styles, the approach enables
the analysis of “utopias” that result when views match the strate-
gies and “dystopias” that result when they do not.

"Anticipatory approaches have successfully managed a wide
range of decision problems in which the relative uncertainties
are reducible, and the stakes or outcomes associated with the
decisions to be made are modest (Kay ef al., 1999). A number
of uncertainty analysis techniques, such as Monte Carlo sam-
pling, Bayesian methods, and fuzzy set theory, have been
designed to perform sensitivity and uncertainty analysis relat-
ed to the quality and appropriateness of the data used as inputs
to models. However, these techniques, suitable for addressing
technical uncertainties, ignore those uncertainties that arise
from an incomplete analysis of the climate change phenomena,
or from numerical approximations used in their mathematical
representations (modelling uncertainties), as well as uncertain-
ties that arise from omissions through lack of knowledge (epis-
temological uncertainties). Current methods thus give decision
makers limited information regarding the magnitude and
sources of the underlying uncertainties and fail to provide them
with straightforward information as input to the decision-mak-

sequential strategies in that in the former information is endoge-
nous, that is, the type, rate, and quality of information gained
depends on both the unfolding scenario and policy choices
whereas information is exogenous in the sequential strategies.)
Adaptive decision strategies are closely tied to the concept of
robustness, because such strategies are most useful in situations
of deep uncertainty—where robustness, as opposed to optimiza-
tion, appears to be the best decision-making criterion.

"Robustness is not a new concept, but it is just recently, under
the pressure of global environmental problems and the acceler-
ation of change, that such approaches have grown in formaliza-
tion and sophistication (Rosenhead, 1990). Rooted in Savage’s
maximizing the minimum regret (1954), Simon’s ideas of satis-
fying strategies (1959 a and b), and Lindbolm’s incremental
policies (1959), the search for robust strategies as a formal deci-
sion-making criterion has grown during the 1990s. However, it
has always been more difficult to implement robustness, as
opposed to optimization, within an analytical method, except
for in very special cases. A new development over the past few
years is that it is now becoming possible to implement robust-
ness as an analytical criterion using simulation models of the
type relevant to climate change policy. In conclusion, multisce-
nario simulation approaches, like multiple-model routes,
exploratory models, or parallel modelling, show that uncertain-
ty is no longer a theoretical scientific concept, but a notion that
might be usefully deployed by decision makers in arriving at
their decisions (van Asselt and Rotmans, 1997).

"It is therefore impossible to assess the costs and benefits of
the Kyoto Protocol or of other potential agreements on cli-
mate change independently of the number of signatories of
the agreement and of their abatement targets and/or policy
commitment. However, the number of signatories is endoge-
nous and depends on the abatement targets and mitigation
polices adopted in various countries. Hence the weakness of
most of the available literature on costs and benefits of cli-
mate change policies, which widely neglects the full interde-
pendency between policies, costs—benefits, and signatories
(more generally, the structure of the international agree-
ments). For example, studies analyze the costs of implement-
ing the Kyoto Protocol either through a set of domestic poli-
cies and measures or through a system of international trad-
able permits, with a fixed number of signatories. But the
adoption of either policy crucially affects the number of sig-
natories, which can be larger or lower under policies and mea-
sures than under tradable permits. And the number (and iden-
tity) of signatories crucially affects the costs and benefits of
different agreements.

"Therefore, this section aims to provide an analysis of the effec-
tiveness of climate policies by focusing on the link between
policy options on the one hand and the structure of the agree-
ments and international regimes on the other. Some of the most
important theoretical results are reviewed first, and then the
existing literature is revisited to see which information it pro-
vides on the interdependencies described above. In particular,
can such an analysis show whether there exist the conditions
for an agreement on climate change to be signed by all or
almost all world countries (see Carraro, 1998; Carraro and
Siniscalco, 1998; and Barrett, 1999 for a theoretical analysis of
these conditions)? Also, would it show which countries can
play a leadership role with respect to achieving the largest pos-
sible coalition by proposing strategies, measures, and institu-
tions that help expand the number of countries that commit to
control their emissions (see Grubb and Gupta, 2000)? Notice
that in this way we also analyze which strategies can be pro-
posed to reduce the costs of mitigation policies. But this is a
quite different approach to those analyzed in the previous sec-
tions of this chapter and in Chapters 8 and 9. The reason is that
here a country’s goal is not to identify a new climate friendly
technology or an adequate redistribution of costs across sec-
tors. Now the goal is to affect other countries’ behaviour to
increase the number of those that share the burden, and to share
the burden more equitably.

"If the goal is to understand which international regime is like-
ly to emerge to control GHG emissions, game theory is cer-
tainly the best tool. Indeed, game theory has been used exten-
sively to analyze the possibility of coalition formation in the
presence of free riding (i.e., when parties have to agree on the
provision of a public good). Early contributions (see Hardin
and Baden, 1977) characterized the environmental game
among countries as a prisoners’ dilemma, inevitably leading to
the so-called “tragedy” of the common property goods.
However, in the real world, at the same time, many interna-
tional environmental agreements on the commons were signed,
often involving subgroups of negotiating countries and some-
times involving economic and technological transfers and
other links to other policies (trade, technological co-operation,
etc.). It was therefore necessary to develop new models to help
understand the logic of coalition formation in the presence of
spillovers, and the possibility to increase welfare by means of
appropriate mechanisms and strategies. These new models
were developed in the 1990s within a non-co-operative game-
theory framework, and provide interesting indications on the
likely outcomes of climate negotiations.
"	Text
"As a consequence, given what is said above, equity is crucial
to assess adequately the costs of emission reductions at the
global and country level. It has been argued that some coun-
tries are allowed to reduce emissions less than other countries,
both within (Kram, 1998) and outside the European Union
(EU) bubble (Bosello and Roson, 1999; Metz, 1999; Rose and
Stevens, 1999). Even when applying the Kyoto mechanisms,
some countries will benefit from the agreements more than
other ones (Nordhaus and Boyer, 1999). It has also been argued
that some countries can exploit their monopolistic power in a
future trading system (Burniaux, 1998). All these remarks
address the problem of optimal burden-sharing (the distribu-
tion of costs) of climate change control. This problem is strict-
ly related to the features of an international agreement on cli-
mate for two main reasons. First, increasing the number of par-
ticipating countries reduces the direct costs for each signatory;
second, an agreement in which the burden is equitably shared
is more likely to be signed by a large number of countries
(Convery, 1999). Therefore, equity and the structure of the
international agreement (number and identity of signatories)
are strictly linked. However, the number of signatories affects
and is affected by costs. Hence, equity and efficiency cannot be
separated.

ties of internal and external stability (this result is shown in

"!0 Unfortunately, game theory is far from achieving a well-defined
non-co-operative theory of coalition formation under the above gen-
eral assumptions and definitions. Several stability concepts can be
used, but these unfortunately provide different equilibrium coalition
structures. Among these are the concepts of equilibrium binding
agreements (Ray and Vohra, 1997), a-stability and f-stability (Hart
and Kurz, 1983), sequential stability (Bloch, 1997), open-membership
stability (Yi, 1997), and far-sighted stability (Chew, 1994; Mariotti,
1997).

"The remaining question is therefore a policy one. Is a country’s
welfare larger when one or when several coalitions form? And
what happens with environmental effectiveness? The answer is
still uncertain, both because theory provides examples in
which a single agreement is preferred, at least from an envi-
ronmental viewpoint, to many small regional agreements (and
vice versa), and because empirical studies have not yet con-
vincingly addressed this issue. Moreover, the conclusion cru-
cially depends on the choice of the equilibrium concept and on
the size of leakage.

"Consider the case in which countries are free to sign the agree-

1997; Carraro and Moriconi, 1998). The multiplicity of coali-

"No participation constitutes the benchmark for evaluating the

the baseline (or business as usual) scenario, because it identi-

ables when no coalition forms and no action, unilateral or co-
operative, is adopted (IPCC SAR (IPCC, 1995) is a good
example of this approach). The construction of the baseline
scenario is very important to assess both the profitability and
the stability (i.e., whether it is self-enforcing) of a coalition. A

negotiate effective emission reductions is unlikely to lead to a
coalition formed by all or by almost all countries, unless more
complex policy strategies, in which environmental policy
interacts with other policy measures, are adopted.? This is why
in the game-theoretic environmental economics literature two
main sets of instruments are proposed to expand environmen-
tal coalitions, that is to increase the number of signatories of an
environmental agreement. These instruments are “economic
and technological transfers” and “issue linkage”. The potential
of these instruments is analyzed in Section 10.2.5, which deals
with partial agreements and ways to broaden them.

"The case of partial agreements is most often analyzed in recent
empirical literature, for two reasons. First, as shown in Section
10.2.1, theory suggests that a partial coalition forms at the
equilibrium. Hence, the climate problem is neither a “tragedy
of commons” nor a situation in which there are clear incentives
to co-operative emission control. Second, the history of inter-
national environmental negotiations is a history of partial

"A second reason to assess the cost of a unilateral participation
is that it could identify a series of low cost (or no cost) options
(so called low hanging fruits or no regrets actions) that could
be implemented independently of the formation of a climate
coalition. It could also help identify policy mixes that help
restructure the fiscal system and public regulatory and incen-
tive schemes in such a way that emission abatement costs are
more than compensated by other economic (non-environmen-
tal) benefits (the so-called double dividends).!!

"An extensive literature analyses the costs and sometimes the
benefits of introducing policies to control GHG emissions in a
single country (Hoel, 1991; Bucholz and Konrad, 1994; Porter
and Van Linde, 1995; Hoel and Schneider, 1997; Endres and
Finus, 1998). Given the arguments proposed in the
Introduction and the results summarized in Section 10.3.1, this
type of exercise may seem unreasonable. There are, however,
two main justifications for undertaking it. The first is that

"coalition. The baseline scenario crucially affects these incen-
tives also. If the no participation case is such that emissions
decline and the target can be achieved easily through small
emission reductions, then the incentives to join the coalition
(sign the agreement) are much higher, so a coalition with many
countries is more likely to form (Barrett, 1997b).
Symmetrically, if large emission reductions are necessary,
abatement becomes more costly, and incentives to free-ride
increase, which further increases the costs for co-operating
countries (particularly if leakage is high).
"	Text
"The definition of a baseline scenario has therefore a strategic
dimension and can hardly be defined as an “objective” evalua-
tion of future economic and environmental cycles and trends.
It is therefore important to collect, as in Chapter 2, the largest
amount of information from different sources and to identify
the scenario more as an average of much scattered information,
rather than as a subjective analysis of likely future events. This
may reduce the likelihood of strategic definitions of the base-
line scenario and may partly prevent the consequent impacts on
the equilibrium coalition and on the assessment of costs and
benefits of climate policies.

"measures) hardly depend on the coalition structure. Indeed,
only if leakage is large, and if climate policies have a large
impact on trade and financial flows, are the costs of domestic
abatement policies significantly affected by the size of the
coalitions and by the agreed emission targets. Hence, it may be
useful to compute the costs of unilateral participation as a
benchmark case, which identifies costs that can be reduced
only when coalition forms and the Kyoto mechanisms are
implemented among signatory countries. Notice the impor-
tance of a careful assessment of leakage and of trade and finan-
cial repercussions of climate policies (McKibbin et al., 1998).
Notice also that the above arguments concern the costs but not
the benefits of climate policies. Indeed, the climate benefits of
unilateral participation are likely to be zero or almost zero for
all or almost all countries (a possible exception is the USA),
given the global nature of the climate problem (Hoel, 1991;
Bucholz and Konrad, 1994; Endres and Finus, 1998).
"	Text
"A careful definition of the no participation case is therefore
very relevant to assess the likelihood of large coalitions and
thus the efficiency of a climate agreement. But it is also very
relevant in terms of equity. When the burden of emissions
abatement has to be shared equitably, it is important to distrib-
ute emissions targets with reference to the baseline scenario.
Each country therefore has an incentive to pretend that its own
baseline scenario implies larger emissions than is actually true
(Grubb, 1998; Bohm, 1999). In this way, the actual cost for the
country would be lower. An optimistic scenario in which pre-
dicted emissions are lower than “true” emissions (as measured
ex-post) leads countries to agree on low emission-reduction
targets, but forces countries to more reductions later and to pay
abatement costs larger than expected. A pessimistic scenario
makes the agreement more difficult because larger emission
reductions have to be agreed, but countries find themselves in
a better situation and pay lower costs ex-post. Hence, if a coun-
try succeeds in convincing the others that its own baseline
emissions are larger than the “true” ones, then this country
achieves relative benefits in terms of less-stringent emission
targets and lower abatement costs.

"The main result can be summarized as follows. Despite their
high variability, all the studies show that the Kyoto mecha-

coalition structure. Hence, emissions trading, and more gener-

all mitigation costs without reducing the effectiveness of the

relevant studies. !*

"Second, the Kyoto agreement can theoretically be interpreted
as a partial (Carraro, 1998) or as a global agreement (Chander
et al., 1999). It is interpreted as a global agreement when all
countries are seen as committed to emission targets. Those in
Annex B are committed to emission targets with respect to
1990, the other ones are “committed” to emissions levels that
evolve as in the baseline scenario. This second interpretation is
nothing more than a “technical” interpretation, which is useful
to show th:

"(a) The answer to the first question depends on two main factors:
the baseline scenario and the degree of leakage. If the baseline
scenario is very ambitious and leakage is high, then countries
find it difficult to undertake large emissions reductions (decreas-
ing returns of scale in emission abatement are usually assumed),
and also their effort is offset by the leakage effect (the increased
emissions by free-riding countries). Hence, a partial coalition is
effective whenever there is no or little leakage, high pollution
levels characterize the baseline scenario, and signatory countries
contribute a large share of the total emissions.

"'? For example, Shogren (1999) notes that “it is estimated that any
agreement without the cost flexibility provided by trading will at least
double the USA costs, ... the key is to distribute emissions interna-
tionally so as to minimise the costs of climate policy”. Manne and
Richels (1999b) state that losses in 2010 are two and one-half times
higher with the constraint on the purchase of carbon emission rights;
international co-operation through trade is essential if we are to
reduce mitigation costs (see also Glomstrod et al., 1992; Burniaux,

the possible strategies to increase the number of countries that
commit themselves to emission control targets (see the papers

"Two remarks are important. First, even if most recent analy-
ses deal with the Kyoto agreement, there are studies that try
to compute the optimal coalition structures, in terms of both
participation and targets, independently of the decisions taken
in Kyoto (a recent attempt is in Nordhaus and Boyer (1999)).
Usually the conclusion derived from these papers is that
Kyoto is neither economically nor environmentally optimal.
However, the notion of optimality is not very useful when
analyzing coalition formation. Indeed, what matters is the
notion of the stability of a coalition. This identifies which
countries have an incentive to join the coalition (sign the
agreement) for different membership and institutional rules,
baseline scenarios, abatement costs (and therefore climate
policies, including the degree of adoption of Kyoto mecha-
nisms), and environmental benefits (and therefore impacts,
adaptation costs, etc.).

"However, all the above papers also show that the size of the
coalition crucially affects the size of the benefits that derive
from the adoption of the Kyoto mechanisms. The larger the
number of participating countries, and the higher the variabili-
ty of marginal abatement costs across them, the larger the ben-
efits from emissions trading and the clean development mech-
anism (CDM). Hence, to reduce abatement costs and increase
environmental benefits, policies, rules, and institutions should
be designed to achieve the largest possible coalition.
"	Text
"(c) The third question, how to broaden a climate coalition, is
often related to the issue of links between a climate agreement
and other international agreements. Indeed, two types of poli-
cy options, based respectively on economic and technological
transfers and on issue linkage, are often proposed as the way to
achieve larger climate coalitions. These policies imply that
links must be established between different multilateral agree-
ments (e.g., agreements on both climate and free trade or tech-
nological co-operation).
"	Text
"If assuming an even broader type of flexibility than incorpo-
rated in the Kyoto mechanisms (banking and borrowing and
international emissions trading (IET) among all countries) then
compliance costs are further lowered. This result is shown in
Bosello and Roson (1999) for banking, Westskog (1999) for
banking and borrowing, Manne and Richels (1999a, 1999b),
McKibbin er al. (1998), and many others for IET among all
countries. If in addition the incentives to innovation provided
by the Kyoto mechanisms are taken into account, then compli-
ance costs are even lower (Buonnano ef al. 1999).
"	Text
"A second policy strategy aimed at expanding the number of
signatories to a climate agreement is based on the idea of
designing a negotiation mechanism in which countries do not
bargain only on GHG reductions, but also on another interre-
lated (economic) issue. For example, Barrett (1995, 1997c) and
Kirchgassner and Mohr (1996) propose to link climate negoti-
ations to negotiations on trade liberalization, Carraro and
Siniscalco (1995, 1997) and Katsoulacos (1997) propose to
link them to negotiations on R&D co-operation, and Mohr
(1995) proposes a link to international debt.
"	Text
"Another general conclusion emerges from the analysis carried
out in Carraro and Siniscalco (1993): both the existence of sta-
ble coalitions and the possibilities of expanding them depend
on the pattern of interdependence among countries. If there is
leakage (i.e., a non-co-operating country expands its emissions
when the coalition restricts them, thus offsetting the effort of
the co-operating countries), then environmental benefits from
co-operation are low, the incentive to free-ride is high, and
conditions for economic and technological transfers to be
effective are unlikely to be met. If, on the contrary, there is no
leakage (i.e., the free-riders simply enjoy the cleaner environ-
ment without paying for it, but do not offset the emission
reduction by the co-operating countries), then environmental
benefits are larger, free-riding is less profitable, and transfers
may achieve their goal to expand the coalition.
"	Text
"set. The possibility of using self-financed economic and tech-
nological transfers to stabilize environmental agreements is
analysed in Carraro and Siniscalco (1993) and Hoel (1994),
which show that these transfers may be successful only if asso-
ciated with a certain degree of commitment. For example,
when countries are fairly symmetric, only if a group of coun-
tries is committed to co-operation can another group of uncom-
mitted countries be induced to sign the agreement by a system
of economic and technological transfers (Carraro and
Siniscalco, 1993).'3 This gives developed countries the respon-
sibility to lead the expansion of the coalition. However, the
amount of resources that would be necessary to induce large
developing countries to join the agreement may be such that
some developed countries perceive the economic costs of a cli-
mate agreement to be larger than its environmental benefit. In
this case, the transfer mechanism would undermine the exis-
tence of the leader coalition and would therefore be ineffective.
This is why countries in the leader coalition must be strongly
committed to co-operation on emission control.
"	Text
"First, consider economic and technological transfers. It is quite
natural to propose these transfers to compensate those coun-
tries that may lose by signing the environmental agreement. In
other words, a redistribution mechanism among signatories,
from gainers to losers, may provide the basic requirement for a
self-enforcing agreement to exist, that is the profitability of the
agreement for all signatories. Therefore, if well designed, eco-
nomic and technological transfers can guarantee that no coun-
try refuses to sign the agreement because it is not profitable.
Moreover, Chander and Tulkens (1995, 1997) and Chander et
al. (1999) show economic and technological transfers exist
such that not only is each country better off within a global
coalition than it is with no coalition at all (the no participation
case), but also it is better off within a global coalition than it is
in any subcoalition, provided the remaining countries behave
non-co-operatively (see also Markusen 1975; Germain et al.,
1997). This result is important because it implies that no coun-
try or group of countries has an incentive to exclude other
countries from the environmental coalition, that is the grand
coalition is optimal (but it may not be stable).

port to developing countries, and also make this support con-

themselves to adequate emission reductions).!°

"may be possible that the agreement in which the countries
decide to co-operate on both issues is profitable to all of them.
The idea of “issue linkage” can also be used to achieve the sta-

not enjoy the benefits that arise from signing simultaneously
other multilateral agreements (e.g., those on technological co-
operation), then incentive for all countries to sign the linked
agreement is strong.

"This approach is likely to function when the negotiation on an
issue with excludable benefits (a “club good” in economic
words) is linked to the climate negotiation (which, if success-
ful, typically provides a public good, that is a non-excludable
benefit). An example could be the linkage of environmental
negotiations with negotiations on technological co-operation
whose benefits are largely shared among the signatories when-
ever innovation spillovers to non-signatories are low (see
Carraro and Siniscalco, 1997).!+

"(d) The final question concerns the link between equity!® and
the size of a climate agreement and, as a consequence, between
equity and the agreement’s environmental effectiveness. It has
been shown that the use of different criteria to share the cost of

rium coalitions, that is the number and identity of signatory
countries (Barrett, 1997a; Botteon and Carraro, 1997a, 1997b;
Eyckmans, 2000). For the Kyoto Protocol, Convery (1999)
argues that without assigning generous emission targets to
Russia and Ukraine, these countries would not have signed the
agreement. Eyckmans (2000) proves the same conclusion by
simulating different equilibrium climate coalitions with the
Regional Integrated Model of Climate and the Economy
(RICE). Indeed, without implementing the Kyoto mechanisms,
Russia and Ukraine have an incentive not to ratify the protocol,
whereas with joint implementation (JI) and trading, and with
the possibility of exchanging excess GHG emissions, all coun-

tries gain. But this again raises the equity problem and
the related burden-sharing issue. Equity may have a
large impact on the existence and size of a climate
coalition. As previously argued, and as argued by many
policymakers and scientists, the way in which the bur-
den of controlling emissions is shared across countries
crucially affects a country’s decision to join a coalition.
On the one hand, if the burden is not equitably shared,
some countries may not find it profitable to sign the
agreement. Profitability depends on two main factors:
(1) the distribution of costs within the coalition and (2)
the size of the coalition. It is possible that there exists a
minimum size of the coalition above which it becomes
profitable. And these two factors are strictly interde-
pendent. On the other hand, equity also affects free-rid-
ing incentives. As in Section 10.2.5, in some cases it
may be reasonable for some countries to transfer
resources to other countries to induce them to join the
coalition on which they would otherwise free-ride. In
this case, the final outcome is not equitable—free-riders
would gain more than countries in the starting coali-
tion—but it may be environmentally and economically
efficient.

¢ The strong incentives to free-ride on the global agree-
ment and the lack of related sanctions. When all coun-
tries agree to control emissions, a defecting country
achieves the whole benefit, because its incidence on
global emission is marginal (with a few exceptions) and
pays no cost. Hence, a defection with respect to a large
coalition is the optimal strategy if there are no sanc-
tions. However, credible sanctions are difficult to
design (Barrett, 1994). Emissions themselves are hard-
ly acredible sanction, because countries are unlikely to
sustain self-damaging policies. Moreover, in this case,

all countries participate, in one form or another (see, e.g.,

Shackleton, 1998; Bosello and Roson, 1999; Nordhaus and

shows the potential for the achievement of co-operation to be

not analyse the incentives to actually sign the agreement.
However, the paper suggests a research direction that at least
helps to identify the optimal emission reductions that are prof-
itable for all negotiating countries.

"While game theory analysis usually models states as unitary
actors, much political science research conceives of states as
complex political systems. The behaviour of a complex actor
can be seen as a function of three main determinants: the inter-
nal configuration of preferences, the internal distribution of
influence and power, and the nature of political institutions
(which specify the decision rules). Domestic decision-making
processes often produce outcomes that differ significantly from
those that maximize the net national welfare. Particularly rele-
vant in this context are three findings that illustrate systematic
biases.

"The conclusions that can be derived from this type of empiri-
cal analyses are similar to those already mentioned for partial
agreements. In the scenario in which baseline emissions are
lower, it is easier to achieve a global agreement because lower
emissions reductions are necessary (Barrett, 1997b) and conse-
quently abatement costs are lower. Optimal emissions targets
are such that they equalize marginal abatement costs. This opti-
mal, cost-minimizing solution can also be achieved through an
unconstrained emissions-trading system (Chander et al., 1999).
Hence, either emissions targets are optimally set, or countries
are allowed to trade emissions for any given set of targets
through which a global consensus can be achieved. Of course,
these two options have different impacts on equity. As shown
by Bosello and Roson (1999), starting from the Kyoto targets,
international unconstrained emissions trading among all coun-
tries achieves optimality, but reduces equity.

"asymmetries play a double role: some countries may
not gain from signing the environmental agreement,
whereas some countries, even when gaining from envi-
ronmental co-operation, may lose from carrying out the
economic sanctions (Barrett, 1997c; Schmidt, 1997).
The absence of environmental leadership. The process
of achieving a global agreement can be a sequential one
(Carraro and Siniscalco, 1993), in which case a group
of countries take the leadership, start to reduce and/or
control emissions and implement strategies such as to
induce other countries to follow.!” The presence of low-
cost climate policies and equitable burden-sharing
(Schmidt, 1997) are again important elements for the
formation of an initial profitable coalition. As said, our
definition of profitability accounts for the environmen-
tal benefits of emission control. Hence, benefits should
be increased by increasing the number of countries that
control emissions, but abatement costs should be mini-
mized by exploiting all possible opportunities (includ-
ing emissions trading). This is a prerequisite to achiev-
ing a strong leader coalition that can exert its leadership
through the design of better negotiation rules, the
implementation of transfer mechanisms, and the credi-
bility of international-issue linkages. A preliminary
model of the effects of leadership is given in Jacoby et
al. (1998), who show how and when developing coun-
tries may join a leader coalition formed by Annex I
countries.

The focus on a single international climate agreement.
As explained in Section 10.3.1, if countries may join
different coalitions, which means that several agree-
ments can be signed by groups of countries in the same
way as countries form trade blocs, then the likelihood
that all or almost all countries set emission reduction
targets increases (Yi and Shin, 1994; Bloch, 1997;
Carraro, 1997, 1998). The outcome of negotiations in
which more agreements can be signed is usually a situ-
ation with several small environmental blocs (Carraro
and Moriconi, 1998), but this can be considered a step
in the right direction. If all or almost all countries set
emission reduction targets within their own bloc (e.g.,
regional environmental agreements are signed), then, in
a subsequent phase, negotiations among blocs may lead
to more ambitious emission reductions.

policy in isolation, on its own merits only. In the real world,
new issues enter a policy space that is already crowded by
other problems competing for attention. In such an environ-

that a particular option will be adopted depend on how well it
combines with other salient concerns. As we have seen in, for
example, the acid rain case, policy confluence and synergy can
make a significant difference for some of the parties. However,
although the causal mechanism itself is well understood, it is
triggered by circumstances that occur more or less at random.
Thus, the aggregate net impact in terms of the climate change

above, may be a powerful strategy).

"Second, political science emphasizes (more and more) the rele-
vance of “social norms”, “social learning”, and the operation of
“social roles” in regime processes (Young, 1999). These
approaches recognize that all international environmental
regimes are “social institutions” that develop particular (social)
dynamics and induce behavioural consequences: the matter of
social norms refers to behaviour that roots in considerations of
legitimacy or authoritativeness. Actors, who regard the rules of
regimes as legitimate, often comply without engaging in
detailed calculations of the costs and benefits (of their doing
so). One important effect of international regimes is that they
initiate social learning processes. Already, the start of global
negotiating generally has resulted in the generation of new
facts, ideas, and perspectives that reduce uncertainty and lead to
changes in the prevailing discourses, values, and actual behav-
iour of actors. The operation of social roles refers to the obser-
vation that actors regularly take on new roles under the terms of
institutional arrangements that shape identities and interests.

Compliance is a matter of whether and to what extent countries do adhere to the provisions of the accord (Jacobson and Brown Weiss,
1995; Underdal, 1998). The concept of compliance includes implementation, but it is generally broader. Compliance focuses not only
on whether implementing measures are in effect, but also on whether there is compliance with the implementing actions. Compliance
measures the degree to which the actors whose behaviour is targetted by the agreement (whether they be local government units, cor-
porations, organizations, or individuals) conform to the implementing measures and obligations (Brown Weiss, 1999).

Implementation refers to the actions (legislation or regulations, judicial decrees, or other actions) that governments take to translate
international accords into domestic law and policy (Jacobson and Brown Weiss, 1995; Underdal, 1998; Brown Weiss, 1999). It includes
those events and activities that occur after authoritative public policy directives have been issued, such as the effort to administer the
substantive impacts on people and events (Mazmanian and Sabatier, 1983). It is important to distinguish between the legal implemen-
tation of international commitments (in national law) and the effective implementation (measures that induce changes in the behaviour
of target groups; see Ziirn, 1996).

also influence the activities and responses of non-state actors

stakeholders come to play an increasing role in design and

"Success or failure in the implementation of international envi-

are implemented in countries, once the parties to the agree-

implementation of international environmental arrangements is
very important to the overall effectiveness of the treaty. Results
of attempts to develop co-operative solutions to international
environmental problems are found in the domestic setting of
the decision-making (Hanf and Underdahl, 1995; Hanf and
Underdal, 2000). Indeed, to understand what is likely to hap-
pen at the international level, it is necessary to examine the
underlying factors and processes, structures, and values at the
national level (Kawashima, 1997; Kotov ef al., 1997;
Kawashima, 2000). These determine the manner in which
national positions on negotiating international agreements are
arrived at and the ultimate agreements are then carried out. In
turn, the expectation is that what has happened or is happening
in various international arenas influences these domestic
processes and decisions within individual countries; thus,
national—international linkages within the decision-making
process are very strong.

"Discussions are underway on how to enforce international
commitments, that is to make parties to the international
treaties conform with their international obligations through
application of various tools (penalties, sanctions, etc.). Some
researchers argue that enforcement might be especially diffi-
cult in international systems and, thus, is often unlikely unless
a party persistently fails to comply.'® Besides, non-compliance
is frequently the product of incomplete planning and miscalcu-
lation rather than a wilful act (Victor et al., 1998). Thus,
enforcement is often contrasted to the management of non-
compliance and implementation failures (non-compliance is a
problem to be solved, not an action to be punished), which
includes greater transparency, non-adversarial forms of dispute
resolution, technical and economic assistance, persuasion, and
negotiation (Haas ef al., 1993; Chayes and Chayes, 1995;
Sand, 1995; Downs et al., 1996; Ziirn, 1996; Peterson, 1997;
Victor et al., 1998; Vogel and Kessler, 1998). However, there
are also good reasons to consider coercive “enforcement” tech-
niques—in cases of severe violations they may be more effec-
tive. In this debate, standard solutions do not exist and a mixed
approach seems to be reasonable.

"Studies confirm that in the past compliance of nearly all gov-

ations has been quite high. However, this often reflects that the
commitments were fairly trivial, in many cases simply codify-
ing rather than changing behaviour (Brown Weiss, 1999; Victor
and Skolnikoff, 1999). But the effectiveness of these commit-
ments in reducing environmental problems was also low.
Incentives to cheat were few and the need for strict monitoring
and enforcement was low. As efforts to tackle environmental
problems intensified, as in the case of climate change, coun-
tries’ commitments became more demanding and stringent, the
costs and complexity of implementation increased, and thus
the incentives to cheat have grown. For this reason, stricter
monitoring and enforcement are increasingly essential to
ensure that these commitments are implemented fully (Sand,
1996; Victor and Skolnikoff, 1999). The historical record of
high compliance without much monitoring and enforcement is
a poor indicator of what will be needed for more effective
international environmental protection in the future.

"Signing (and ratification) of an international agreement consti-
tutes no guarantee that it will be implemented effectively and
complied with. Nor does the refusal to sign an agreement nec-
essarily mean that an actor will act contrary to its terms.
Moreover, an actor may comply with some provisions (e.g.,
procedural obligations), but not with others (e.g., substantive
rules that require major behavioural change), and meet some
obligations partially (for example, by reducing emissions, but
less and/or later than required by the agreement). It is neces-
sary to note that rule-consistent behaviour may not always be
induced by the treaty, or necessarily result from the existence
of a particular agreement. For one thing, some international
agreements do not require that all actors change their behav-
iour—some actors may already behave as prescribed by regime
rules (Brown Weiss and Jacobson, 1998). Moreover, in some
cases for which behavioural change is prescribed, the required
change may come about without any deliberate effort to meet
the obligation, and compliance without implementation occurs.
For example, the recent sharp economic recession in Russia
(more than a 50% decrease in Gross National Product (GNP)
during the 1990s) resulted in sufficient pollutant-emission
reduction from industrial and other activities to meet (and even
to “over-comply with’) the domestic targets set by a number of
international agreements. Little effort was required on the part
of the government or non-government actors to honour these
commitments (Kotov and Nikitina, 1996, 1998). A number of
recent research efforts conclude that most domestic behaviour-
al change can be attributed to many exogenous factors, and is
not induced directly by the international regime, but this
change contributes to compliance with the regime goals and
targets (Levy et al., 1995). These specifics affect seriously
decision-making patterns regarding the implementation of the
climate change regime.

of emissions measurement and verification, including the
release and absorption of carbon from changes in land use, rice
cultivation, and forest management, will become even more
important. And it represents one of the toughest challenges for
the scientific community. By adding three additional gases and
sinks, the Kyoto Protocol fulfils its ambition to be more com-
plete, but at the same time it makes compliance more difficult,

problems as global warming are still poorly understood, and

from different sources are often not comparable. For example,
data from the International Energy Agency (IEA) are different
from national figures. Even different ministries in the same
country, let alone in other countries, use different assumptions,
which significantly hampers the comparability of data.
Assumptions on burden sharing and cost-effectiveness analysis
become more difficult or even arbitrary. Thus, one of the first

"Within the decision-making process regarding UNFCCC
implementation, today more attention is given to assessing
national emissions, policy, and measures. The process of com-
piling GHG emission inventories is well underway. Parties to
the UNFCCC are obliged to compile and submit national com-
munications on how they are implementing the convention
(Green, 1995). These reports include inventories of GHG emis-
sions, reports on policies and measures that the parties have
adopted to try to stabilize or reduce emissions, and (eventual-
ly) an account of the extent to which emission abatement has
been successful. Since 1991, IPCC and the Organization for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have built
effective guidelines for inventory reporting. All parties to the
convention must use this system of reporting to the UNFCCC
regarding emissions by sources and removals by sinks. Within
this framework the governments are actively contributing to
the international reporting process in submitting their national
reports. Experts regard data reported by them as the backbone
of the IPCC international system, while the EU is also engag-
ing its own system — Coordination-Information-Air (CORI-
NAIR). Without good data, systems of implementation review
work poorly or not at all (Lanchbery, 1998). This system was
intended to be applicable to all countries and for the main
emissions sector (that for energy-related CO, emissions), and
it makes use of energy flow statistics of the type that most
developed countries collect routinely. Special methodologies
and guidelines have been elaborated to convert the national
inventory systems reasonably well, certainly for energy-related
emissions, into the IPCC format. In this and in other respects it
is what is known largely as a “top down“ system.

brought swift compliance. The combination of soft manage-

"Decision making related to climate change is a crucial aspect
of making decisions about sustainable development, simply
because climate change is one of the most important symptoms
of “unsustainability”. Climate change could undermine eco-
nomic activities, social welfare, and equity in an unprecedent-
ed manner, in particular both intra- and intergenerational equi-
ty is likely to be worsened. Now it is widely recognized that
global environmental problems and the ability to meet human
needs are linked through a set of physical, chemical, and bio-
logical processes that have an impact on global hydrological
cycles, affect the boundaries and functioning of ecological sys-
tems, and accelerate land degradation and desertification.

"Despite the close links, climate change and sustainable devel-
opment have been pursued as largely separate discourses. The
sustainable development research community has not general-
ly considered how the impacts of changing climate may affect
efforts to develop more sustainable societies. Conversely,
methodological and substantive arguments associated with sus-
tainable development are still absent in climate change dis-
course. It is difficult to generalize about sustainable develop-
ment policies and choices. Sustainable development implies
and requires diversity, flexibility, and innovation. Policy choic-
es are meant to introduce changes in technological patterns of
natural resource use, production and consumption, structural
changes in the production systems, spatial distribution of pop-
ulation and economic activities, and behavioural patterns.
Moreover, the process of integrating and internalising climate
change and sustainable development policies into national
development agendas requires new problem-solving strategies
and decision-making approaches in which uncertainties need to
be managed to produce robust choices.

"How to make the verification and enforcement system more
effective? Several suggestions in this respect refer to environ-
mental agreements in general (Green, 1993). Different coer-
cive measures, such as trade sanctions and other penalties,
may be needed in cases of severe violations. To date, practice
shows that sanctions have been used rarely, but when applied
they have often been effective (Victor, 1995). A looming chal-
lenge is to determine when and how sanctions can be made
compatible with international trade rules. Potential conflicts
between the sanctions that have sometimes been vital to inter-
national environmental co-operation and the free-trade rules
that discourage sanctions have not been tested or settled.
There are also suggestions to use, for reluctant countries, var-
ious compensations for the costs of implementing the treaties
(compensation for national reporting testifies to this
approach). Other suggestions include bilateral funding pro-
grammes. Several funding programmes have been undertaken
to support the compilation and reporting of national invento-
ries by the developing countries and countries with economies
in transition.

"Chapter | provides a concise overview of sustainable develop-
ment as a context for climate change mitigation policy. As
argued there, the concept of sustainable development defies
objective interpretation or operational implementation.
However, it is precisely the diversity of interpretations that
“makes up the biggest advantage of the concept: it is suffi-
ciently rich and flexible to refract the full diversity of human
interests, values and aspirations” (Raskin et al., 1998). So near-
ly everyone can agree that sustainable development is a good
thing, and consensus has become possible over broad policy
areas in which previously people could not agree. Or, in the
words of O’Riordan (1993), “sustainable development may be
a chimera. It may mark all kinds of contradictions. It may be
ambiguously interpreted by all manners of people for all man-
ners of reasons. But as an ideal it is nowadays as persistent a
political concept as are democracy, justice and liberty.”

"Actions that steer the course of society and its economic and
governmental organizations are largely tasks of making deci-
sions and solving problems. This requires choosing issues that
require attention, setting goals, finding or designing suitable
courses of action, and evaluating and choosing among alterna-
tive actions. The first three of these activities—fixing agendas,
setting goals, and designing actions—are usually called prob-
lem solving; the last, evaluating and choosing, is usually called
decision making (Simon et al., 1986). Except for trivial cases,
decision making generally involves complicated processes of
setting actions and dynamic factors that begins with the identi-
fication of a stimulus for action and ends with a specific com-
mitment to action (Mintzberg, 1994). The complexity of the
decision-making process related to sustainable development
becomes even more problematic simply because the difference
between the present state and a desired state is not clearly per-
ceived, so “we have a better understanding on what is unsus-
tainable rather than what is sustainable” (Fricker, 1998).

"Much of the ambiguity arises from the lack of measurements
that could provide policymakers with essential information on
the alternative choices at stake, on how these choices affect
clear and recognizable social, economic, and environmental
critical issues. Such measurements could also provide a basis
for evaluating policymakers’ performance in achieving goals
and targets. Management requires measurement and now, as
never before, government institutions and the international
community are concerned with establishing the means to
assess and report on progress towards sustainable develop-
ment. “If we genuinely embrace sustainable development, we
must have some idea if the path we are going on is heading
towards it or away from it. There is no way we can know that
unless we know what it is we are trying to achieve—i.e. what
sustainable development means—and unless we have indica-
tors that tell us whether we are on or off a sustainable devel-
opment path” (Pearce, 1998). Therefore, indicators are indis-
pensable to make the concept of sustainable development oper-
ational. They are particularly useful for decision making
because they help (Hardi and Barg, 1997):

"Now, sustainability is perceived as an irreducible, holistic con-
cept in which economic, social, and environmental issues are
interdependent dimensions that must be approached in a uni-
fied framework. However, the interpretation and valuation of
these dimensions give rise to a diversity of approaches.
Different disciplines have their own conceptual framework,
which translates into different variables, different pathways,
and different normative judgements. Economists stress the goal
to maximize the net welfare of economic activities, while
maintaining or increasing the stock of economic, ecological,
and sociocultural assets over time. The social approach tends to
highlight questions of inequality and poverty reduction, and
environmentalists the questions of natural resource manage-
ment and ecosystems’ resilience (Rotmans, 1997). Apart from
the weight placed on each of the critical dimensions, the impor-
tant conclusion from this ongoing debate is that achieving sus-
tainable economic development, conserving environmental
resources, and alleviating poverty and economic injustice are
compatible and mutually reinforcing goals in many circum-
stances.

"The past few years have witnessed a rapidly increasing interest
in the construction of sustainable development indicators to
assess the significance of sustainability concerns in economic
analysis and policy. Different analytical frameworks have been
suggested to identify, develop, and communicate indicators of
sustainability. Hardi and Barg (1997), in an extensive survey of
ongoing work on measuring sustainability, discuss the advan-
tages and limitations of different approaches from the view-
point of their practical applicability. The main differences
among frameworks are (1) the ways and means by which they
identify measurable dimensions, and select and group the
issues to be measured; and (2) the concepts by which they jus-
tify the identification and selection procedure. Some of the
major frameworks are briefly summarized below.
"	Text
"It is recognized (Hardi and Barg, 1997) that much work
remains to be done. Some approaches lack causal linkages or
they tend to over simplify interlinkages and relations among
issues; others focus on the measurement of those segments of
sustainable development that can be expressed in monetary
terms; in some cases detailed calculations of indicators are
highly technical and difficult to handle. Fresh initiatives ori-
ented to capture complex interlinkages in the interactions
between human activity and the environment, especially those
related to pressure—state-response causalities, have been
undertaken in recent years (Meadows, 1998; Bossel, 1999).
Undoubtedly, all these efforts are needed to provide decision
makers with information and operational criteria to assess cur-
rent situations and evaluate strategic decisions. Furthermore,
these efforts hold the additional promise of treating environ-
mental problems within a framework that the key institutions
and agencies in any government will understand.

"At the national level, several important steps to make opera-
tional the concept of sustainable development have being
undertaken. Different sets of thematic indicators are being used
for each of the major issues in national environmental policy,
reflecting differences in national endowment, level of develop-
ment, and cultural traditions, as well as the heterogeneity with-
in countries. The indicators generally cover every aspect of
pollution control, nature conservation, resource depletion,
social welfare, health, education, employment, waste manage-
ment, etc.—in short, a compendium of all the components of
traditional development goals and conventional policy debate.
Hence, factors that distinguish sustainable development from
traditional development tend to be submerged under a sea of
age-old problems that are made no more readily soluble by
bearing the name sustainable development (George, 1999).
The point is that current definitions of indicators and the use of
terminology are particularly confusing and some clarity and
consensus is required about the definition of what an indicator
is, as well as in the definition of related concepts such as
threshold, index, target, and standard. This consensus cannot
be based solely on political agreement; logical and epistemo-
logical soundness is also necessary (Gallopin, 1997).

"One of the most prominent is the Human Development Index
developed by the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP) to ranks a country’s performance on the criteria of
human development, instead of solely the economic perfor-
mance. Though the index was not developed as a sustainable
development index, recent efforts have been made to supple-
ment it with an environmental dimension to encompass explic-
itly the multiple dimensions of sustainability. Integrated envi-
ronmental—economic accounting is a framework that is rapidly
gaining prominence. The basic idea of this approach is to
establish links between the conventional circular produc-
tion—consumption economic accounting to the natural support
system through the extraction of resources in one direction and
the discharge of residuals in the other (Tietenberg, 1996).
Another framework that is attracting a high level of interest is
the multiple capital approach. This approach recognizes that a
country’s wealth is the combination of economic, environmen-
tal, and social capital and these dimensions of capitals should
be preserved, enriched, or substituted if consumed. The World
Bank’s Measure of the Wealth of Nations (World Bank, 1997)
is the most notable application of this framework. The concept
of genuine savings is introduced in the World Bank approach
to measure the true rate of saving of a nation after accounting
for the depreciation of produced assets, the depletion of natur-
al resources, investments in human capital, and the value of
global damages from carbon emissions. Lastly, the
Pressure—State—Response framework (OECD,1993; UNCSD,
1996) focuses on the causal relationships between stress-gen-
erating human activities, changes in the state of the natural and
social environment, and society responses to these changes
through environmental, general economic, and sectoral poli-
cies.

tures and habits, but these are also shaped and support-
ed by the products and services provided by the eco-
nomic system, as well as by the organization and
administration at all levels. Within the boundaries of
individual freedom, government policies can discour-
age unsound consumption styles and encourage more
sustainable social behaviour through the adoption of
financial incentives (subsidies), disincentives (taxes),
legal constraints, and the provision of wider choices of
infrastructure and services. This point is elaborated fur-

"There are two reasons why lifestyles are an issue of climate
policy. First, consumption patterns are an important factor in
climate change since they have become an essential element of
lifestyles in developed countries. If, for instance, people
changed their preferences from cars to bicycles, this would
alleviate climate change and decrease mitigation costs consid-
erably. Second, many promising domains for substantial envi-
ronmental improvements through technological change also
require changes in lifestyle. With respect to traffic, for
instance, to reach sustainability beyond that of increases in
efficiency requires changes in the modal split and ultimately in
urban planning (Deutscher Bundestag, 1994). Yet lifestyles
have been subjected to far less systematic investigation than
technology (Duchin, 1998, p. 51). In SAR they were not dis-
cussed at all.

"The set of specific policies, measures, and instruments to mit-
igate climate change and consequently promote sustainable
development is quite large. These include generic policies ori-
ented to induce changes in the behaviour of economic agents,
or control and regulatory measures to achieve specific targets
at the sectoral level. A comprehensive discussion of various
aspects of different types of policies and measures is presented
in Chapter 6. Here it is important to note, first, that sustain-
ability issues cannot be addressed by single isolated measures,
but they require a whole set of integrated and mutually rein-
forced policies. Second, weights assigned to different policies
depend on individual countries according to their national cir-
cumstances and specific priorities. Third, the cause-effect
reaction in the process of policy implementation is not linear.
Except in trivial cases, policies tend to disrupt existing pat-
terns, social systems create and respond to changes within
themselves through feedback loops, and new patterns emerge
as social, economic, and environmental aspects interact in the
process of convergence towards the desired goals.

Technological patterns of natural resource use, produc-
tion of goods and services, and final consumption.
These encompass individual technological options and
choices as well as overall technological systems.
Sustainable development on a global scale requires rad-
ical technological changes focused on the efficient use
of materials and energy for the sufficient coverage of
needs, and with minimum impact on the environment,
society, and future. This is of particular importance in
developing countries, in which a major part of the infra-
structure needed can avoid past practices and move
more rapidly towards technologies that use resources in
a more sustainable way, recycle more wastes and prod-
ucts, and handle residual wastes in a more acceptable
manner. As discussed in Chapter 3, the range of oppor-
tunities is extensive enough to cope with different
development styles and national circumstances, but
what is even more important, economic potential
increases as result of the continuous process of techno-
logical change and innovation. A number of technolo-
gies that less than 10 years ago were at the laboratory-
prototype stage are now available in the markets. Issues
on barriers and opportunities for technology develop-
ment, transfer, and diffusion at the national level are
discussed in Chapter 5 and Section 10.3.3 below.
Structural changes in the production system. Economic
growth continues to be a widely pursued objective of
most governments and, therefore, policy decisions on
development patterns may have direct impacts on both
raw material and the energy content of production.
Structural changes towards services or a low energy-
intensity industrial base may or may not affect the over-
all level of economic activity, but could have significant
impacts on the energy content of goods and services.
Spatial distribution patterns of population and eco-
nomic activities. Country-wide policies on the geo-
graphical distribution of human settlements and pro-
ductive activities impact on sustainable development at
three levels: on the evolution of land uses, on mobility
needs and transport requirements, and on the energy
requirements. These factors are of utmost relevance for
most developing countries, in which spatial distribu-
tions of the population and of economic activities are
not yet settled. Therefore, these countries are in a posi-
tion to adopt urban and/or regional planning and indus-
trial policies directed towards a more balanced use of
their geographical space.

India as well as from the USA are referred to by Douglas et al.

who we are, even if they do so not necessarily in a consistent
way. The “social life of things” (Appadurai, 1986) animates all

"In cultural anthropology human behaviour is interpreted in
terms of finding one’s place within the social universe by relat-
ing oneself to others (not only to the proverbial Joneses next
door), that is by setting up distinctions in the community. In
doing so commodities are a means of discrimination. They
“constitute the visible part of culture as the tip of the iceberg
which is the whole of the social processes” (Répke, 1999). Of
course, many goods satisfy needs as well, but they do even this
because of their social capacity to make sense in the individ-
ual’s social context. This explanation of human consumption
behaviour—as advanced by Douglas and Isherwood (1979)—
seems to be considerably more comprehensive than a purely
economic one. However, even if in their account “human
beings are conceived of as social, ... they are just as unpleasant
pursuers of their own interests as they are in economics”

"and patterns of behaviour that are common to a social group,
including patterns of consumption or anticonsumption. It
seemed for a while that a change from environmentally less
benign to more benign consumption patterns had emerged by
itself (Inglehart, 1971, 1977) in the 1970s. What really hap-
pened, however, was not a switch from one coherent and dom-
inant set of values to another, but an end of coherence through
a pluralization of values (Mitchell, 1983; Reusswig, 1994;
Douglas et al., 1998). Current lifestyles reflect this patchwork
of values. Some of these, however, are environmentally more
benign than others. The idea of promoting transfers from the
latter to the former must take into account that lifestyles are not
just a matter of behaving this or that way, but are basically an
expression of people’s self-esteem (see below). Lifestyles,
therefore, are based on ideas with respect to the individual’s
identity. To this extent the issue is not only that individuals
need to change their behaviour, but that they need to change
themselves. This tends to be underestimated in policy consid-
erations, but must be accounted for when such changes become
relevant with respect to climate change. Otherwise discrepan-
cies between people’s environmental consciousness and behav-
iour are deplored but not understood.

"All this seems to imply that any attempt to change lifestyles
intentionally is bound to fail. Intercultural experience, howev-

bounded, unique, more or less integrated motivational and cog-
nitive universe ... is ... a rather peculiar idea within the context
of the world’s cultures” (Geertz, 1979, p. 229). Although in the
Western world even the modern state is supposed to have been
established by an agreement of independent, or decontextual-
ized individuals, the question “Who am I?” in other cultures is
generally answered by reference to the contexts in which one
belongs. That is, to dependencies, and not by independence
claims with respect to oneself. Western people tend to believe
that they are what they are just for themselves, as if everybody
had only his or her first name, but even in Europe the idea of
individual salvation after death, for instance, did not develop
before the 12th century (Ariés, 1977). In contrast, intercultural
studies have shown that traditional Asian, African, Latin
American, and even Southern European concepts of self indi-

Kitayama, 1991). This means “that behaviour is seen as con-
text-bound and aimed towards a harmonious fit with the expec-
tations and evaluations of others, who are continuously
involved in one’s definition of self” (Dittmar, 1992, p. 190).
The barrier of consumption-based identity at the expense of
others might, therefore, be overcome by contextualizing the
Western self in intercultural communication. Section
10.3.2.3.2. gives some indications of how this could be fos-
tered politically.

"Interestingly enough, these low-cost limits appear mainly to
be a matter of equity—not to pay too much more than one’s
fellow citizens—because environmental legislation (for
everybody) is accepted beyond those limits. Politically, envi-
ronmental consciousness can be promoted by environmental
education. This includes primary schools as well as high
schools, adult education, and particularly lecturer’s education
at the college and university level. Environmental education
could be more effective than it has proved so far if it recog-
nized that human behaviour hinges on lifestyle or self-aware-
ness.

"Among the four combinations, so far economic analysis of
consumption has been based mainly on only one, private mate-
rial goods. Since marginal satisfaction with these is decreasing,
the neglected combinations have been reconsidered recently
(Scherhorn, 1997). This is particularly relevant with respect to
climate change, because immaterial and common goods (irre-
spective of their material basis) are or stimulate social activi-
ties that promote the integrity of society. They either foster the
natural environment or endanger it much less than private and
material goods generally do in terms of production, consump-
tion, and waste management. Material goods are not an end in
themselves, so that their real utility is different from their mate-
rial reality. Politically, public education in consumer’s behav-
iour can promote the awareness that identities can be expressed
by a broader plurality of goods than just material and private
goods.

John Stuart Mill’s idea that in affluent societies people might
prefer other forms of satisfaction to ever-increasing consump-
tion of purchased commodities is not prominent in contempo-
rary economics, but has not completely disappeared from eco-
nomic thought (see Harrod, 1958; Hirsch, 1977; Xenos, 1989).
Now there are indications that the marginal utility of those
commodities is steadily decreasing with rising consumption
(see Scherhorn, 1994; Inglehart, 1996). For instance, although
consumption in the USA has doubled since 1957, it is reported
that the average US citizen considers his or her happiness to
have decreased since then (UNDP, 1998). Sanne (1998) reports
from Sweden that 87% of the people have a car, but 14% of
these do not “need” it while only 47% consider it to be “‘nec-
essary’. Similarly, 52% have a dishwasher, but 30% of these do
not “need” it and only 12% deem it “necessary”. The mismatch
between economic consumption and the satisfaction of human
needs is shown by the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare.
This ran parallel to GNP up to the 1970s, but rapidly departed
after that (Nordhaus and Tobin, 1972; Daly and Cobb, 1989;
Jackson and Marks, 1999). If these discrepancies became a
political issue the personal relevance of consumption patterns
could decrease. Politically, the introduction of a suitable index
of welfare and stimulation of public dialogue on the goals of
economic action could foster this.
"	Text
"Climate is a common public good and the debate as to what
extent “commons” can be appreciated in market-based
economies is ongoing. Much of the discussion originally
derives from Olson’s (1965) argument that if people were ratio-
nal egoists in the sense of liberal economics, individual ratio-
nality must lead to collective irrationality in large informal
groups, because free riders could not be excluded. As non-irra-
tional collective actions exist, human behaviour cannot only be
motivated by rational egoism, the problem posed by Olson’s
analysis was to identify these other motivations. Udéhn (1993)
summarized the subsequent discussion comprehensively. The
main outcome confirms that human co-operation generally can-
not be explained economically, but only by taking into account
social or personal commitments. Sen (1976/77, 1985) noted
that such commitments can replace economic “rationality”, or
utility maximization. He also argued, that commitments are
related to a person’s “identity” (discussed above as the key to
lifestyles). These identities, however, are not fixed once and for
all but develop through social intercourse. Correspondingly,
one of the most consistent results of the debate on collective
action is that “co-operation increases dramatically if people are
allowed to communicate before being subjected to a social
dilemma” (Udéhn, 1993; see Dawes, 1980; Orbell er al., 1984;
van de Kragt et al., 1986). This may be expected in market
behaviour as well, so that environmental commitments can
overcome price incentives. By co-operation in the common
interest there is also “reason to believe that appeals to the full
set of motivations and behaviours—accompanied by an analy-
sis of bold options—can encourage lifestyle decisions that
reduce pressures on the environment” (Duchin, in press).

"The linkages between the social, economic, environmental,
and political dimensions of sustainable development call for
policies that can serve multiple objectives, and requires that a
balance be struck when objectives conflict. These linkages are
often mutually reinforcing in the long run, but may sometimes
be contradictory in the short term (OECD, 1999c). In this
regard, a critical requirement of sustainable development is a
capacity to design policy measures that, without hindering
development and remaining consistent with national strategies,
could exploit potential synergies between national economic
growth objectives and environmentally focused policies.
Climate change mitigation strategies offer a clear example of
how co-ordinated and harmonized policies can take advantage
of the synergies between the implementation of mitigation
options and broader objectives.
"	Text
"The potential linkages between climate change mitigation
issues and economic and social aspects have also brought an
important shift in the focus of mitigation analysis literature.
From being confined to project-by-project or sector-based
approaches, analyses and studies are increasingly concerned
with broader policy issues as mechanisms to reduce the
increase of GHG emissions. Fresh methodological develop-
ments (UNEP, 1998) broaden climate change mitigation poli-
cies by incorporating distributional impacts, negative side
effects, and the appropriate choice of instruments and institu-
tional constraints, among others. This provides a somewhat
different slant on the focus of climate change mitigation poli-
cies. More emphasis is now given to exploit mutually reinforc-
ing links among individual actions, to take advantage of the
potential interactions of mitigation options with other objec-
tives, and to supplement individual mechanisms with econom-
ic instruments of wider scope.

"Over the past years, of the policy options to mitigate climate
change, technological options to limit or reduce GHG emis-
sions have received by far the most attention. Chapters 3 and 4
provide a comprehensive review of technologies and practices
to mitigate climate change. Energy efficiency improvements
(including energy conservation), switches to low carbon-con-
tent fuels, use of renewable energy sources, and the introduc-
tion of more advanced non-conventional energy technologies
are expected to have significant impacts on curbing actual
GHG emission tendencies. Similarly, the adoption of new tech-
nologies and practices in agriculture and forestry activities, as
well as the adoption of clean production processes, could make
substantial contributions to the GHG mitigation effort.
Depending on the specific context in which they are applied,
these options may entail ancillary benefits, and in some cases
are worth undertaking whether or not there are climate-related
reasons for doing so.
"	Text
"The existence of ancillary benefits and synergies in imple-
menting mitigation options has been addressed in a preliminary
way in IPCC (1996c). These issues are discussed in detail in
Chapters 7, 8 and 9. Some relevant findings are highlighted
here. The adoption of more sustainable agricultural practices in
Africa (Sokona er al., 1999) illustrates clearly the mutually
reinforcing effects of climate change mitigation, environmen-
tal protection, and economic benefits. In fact, the introduction
or expansion of agroforestry and organic agriculture (i.e.,
methods that intensify agricultural production while using less
input), can improve food security and at the same time reduce
GHG emissions. In agroforestry systems, trees are planted to
delineate plots of land, and further to fix nitrogen, causing the
nutrients lower in the soil to rise up. The trees also prevent soil
erosion, supply firewood and animal fodder, and constitute a
source of income. Organic farming improves the fertility of the
soil through the addition of organic matter. The damage and
diseases caused by insects are virtually eliminated through the
technique of “growing in corridors” and other holistic meth-

"Better understanding (as the Olson debate has shown ) can lead
to the perception of common interests, but such understanding
does not necessarily come about by itself. Its promotion is
rather an objective of “creative democracy” (Burns and
Ueberhorst, 1988). Generally, this is again a matter of educa-
tion, particularly of political education. “Education and produc-
tive employment ... would be worth while policy goals in rela-
tion to global climate change” (Douglas ef al., 1998). Education
implies formal and informal processes of creativity as well as
receptivity, so that not only schools and universities are to be
addressed here. For instance, in Germany most cities have their
special Agenda 21 program, supported by citizens’ movements
and by an Agenda 21 office in local government. This stimu-
lates learning by doing. The administration is in charge here not
simply to implement sustainability locally, but to promote
understanding as well as co-operation in the global interest of
sustainability. A broad public dialogue can also encourage pub-
lic confidence in making changes for the advantage of nature,
the developing countries, and future generations. For behav-
ioural change, “arguably the most important obstacle is the dif-
ficulty of imagining new scripts and removing the obstacles to
actually living them” (Duchin, in press). If that public dialogue,
therefore, is mainly concerned with such “new scripts”, even
the discrepancy between environmental consciousness and
behaviour might finally disappear, so that people as consumers
would no longer lag behind themselves as citizens.

"Awareness of the complex system of interrelated cause-and-
effect chains among climate, biodiversity, desertification,
water, and forestry has been growing in recent years. Now it is
widely recognized that global environmental problems and the
ability to meet human needs are linked through a set of physi-
cal, chemical, and biological processes. Climate change, for
example, alters the global hydrological cycle, affects the
boundaries and functioning of ecological systems, and acceler-
ates land degradation and desertification (Figure 10.5). These
negative impacts in turn reinforce each other through feedback
loops, which results in a serious threat to land productivity,
food supply, fresh-water availability, and biological diversity,
particularly in vulnerable regions (Watson et al., 1998).

"Finally, it is important to underline that for the elements that
constitute policies at different levels to operate in a mutually
reinforcing manner, the creation of appropriate communication
and information channels should be given special attention.
The topic of establishing effective and stable flows of commu-
nication among different stakeholders is seldom addressed in
connection with climate change mitigation. This is mainly
because policies related to climate change tend to treat mitiga-
tion options as isolated projects, each falling into a narrow area
in which potential synergies may be ignored or misunderstood.
As result, environmental policies risk resulting poorly struc-
tured interventions, with a limited scope of influence, and an
overestimated cost-effectiveness (Eskeland and Xie, 1998).

"Energy efficiency improvements and energy conservation are
other issues of economic and strategic concern. In developing
countries, energy demand (for electricity in particular) contin-
ues to grow at a rate that is often hard to keep up with. The
adoption of environmentally sound technologies (ESTs) for
both energy production and energy consumption would enable
these countries to lower the pressure on energy investments,
reduce public investments (in some cases by up to one-third
(World Bank, 1994)), improve export competitiveness, enlarge
energy reserves, and also avoid a large increase in GHG emis-
sions. Thus the alternative energy paths of low-carbon futures
in developing countries can be compatible with national objec-
tives. Such paths could prevent energy and/or GDP intensities
from following the growth path of the developed world, in
which energy demand and GDP elasticity first increased with
successive stages of industrialization, but since have sharply
decreased.

"A large number of similar synergy effects can be found in
industry, transportation, and human settlement patterns. For
example, more decentralized development patterns based on a
stronger role for small- and medium-sized cities can decrease
the rural exodus, reduce needs for transportation, and allow the
use of modern technologies (biotechnology, solar energy, wind,
and small-scale hydropower) to tap the large reserves of natur-
al resources. Building upon the lending experiences of World
Bank operations and sector programmes in a number of coun-
tries, Warford et al. (1996) provide evidence for the positive
linkages between economic policies and the environment.
Although environmental concerns, and climate change issues
in particular, were not explicitly addressed by macroeconomic
and sectoral policies, the country cases analyzed show clear
synergies between reform policies and environmental improve-
ments. In some cases when adverse side effects do occur, the
remedy is not to reverse the reform policies, but rather to intro-
duce specific complementary measures that address the nega-
tive effects.

levels. In other words, creating synergy among the instru-

instruments provide opportunities to implement them in a
mutual-reinforcing manner, avoiding duplication. At least
three clusters of activities are likely to gain advantage from
potential synergies in implementing the conventions: the
development and strengthening of organizational structures,
capacity-building interventions, and data collection and infor-
mation processing.
"	Text
"Implementing the conventions involves the participation of
institutional structures with different responsibilities and con-
cerns, their policy agendas are generally limited in scope, and
frequently their immediate objectives diverge. Further, envi-
ronmental issues are in general broadly diffused through dif-
ferent government agencies, endowed with uneven resources
in terms of both authority and material resources. This institu-
tional fragmentation, especially in developing countries,
results in a lack of co-ordination and duplication of activities in
areas where common organizational procedures, flows of
information, and a set of coherent individual institutional
actions are required for effective policy actions. Reporting to
the respective conferences of the parties, setting up appropriate
legislation, and formulation and periodical updating of nation-
al action plans are stipulated in the conventions. These need to
move towards convergence on overlapping issues, seeking
consensus, and agree on policy frameworks within which the
ultimate goals can be achieved with greater effectiveness.
Therefore, the opportunities for synergies can be exploited by
enhancing and strengthening linkage mechanisms between

"The term technology transfer is interpreted by some as a one-
time transaction that maintains the dependency of the recipient.
Some analysts therefore prefer the notion of technology co-
operation or technology diffusion, which is seen by them as
reflecting a process of technical change brought about by dis-
persed and uncoordinated decisions over time. Others still may
see technology transfer as a two-way learning process that
might more appropriately be called technology communica-
tion. According to the definition used by IPCC (2000a), “tech-
nology transfer encompasses the broad set of processes that
cover the flows of knowledge, experience, and equipment for
mitigating and adapting to climate change among different
stakeholders. These include governments, international organi-
zations, private sector entities, financial institutions, NGOs and
research and/or education institutions. It comprises the process
of learning to understand, utilize, and replicate the technology,
including the capacity to choose it, adapt it to local conditions,
and integrate it with indigenous technologies.” Technology
transfer will therefore be used as a broad term including all
aspects mentioned above.

"Beyond the issues concerning property rights and the process of
opening national economies, changes in the features of new
technologies (systematic character, the important role of users,
increasing knowledge intensity) have significant implications
for technology transfer policy.'? In particular, many ESTs are
still in the early stages of their development and have a com-
paratively short track record, so private actors may be unwilling
to accept the extra risks or costs involved in utilizing new tech-
nologies. In general, the spread of proven ESTs that should dif-
fuse through commercial transactions may be limited because
of existing barriers. Barriers to the transfer of ESTs arise at each
stage of the process, as discussed in detail in Chapter 5. These
vary according to the specific context, for example from sector

countries, developing countries, and countries with economies

cerned need to make common efforts to overcome the barriers
and create opportunities for the transfer and/or diffusion of
technology (Verhoosel, 1997). At present there is no easy
answer for overcoming barriers. Measures to be taken depend
on the specific barriers and the interests of different stakehold-

of most countries in the world economy, countries generally
have two sources of technologies: they can either develop their

between developed and developing countries, it is important to
build up a mutual understanding. Developing countries not
only need technologies relevant to climate change mitigation,
but also those that are able to generate economic benefits and
promote social and economic development, recognizing differ-

Governments have been investing for three decades in R&D
for ESTs in the energy sector. There may be a case for seeing
whether results from this process have been used and dissemi-

adaptive, following externally developed technology, which
suggests the need for additional resources to develop indige-
nous innovative capacity. The activities at all stages of techno-
logical development and implementation are necessary to
attain short-term and long-term technical results (Elliot and

"In many cases of technology transfer, much attention was paid
to the accelerated introduction of technologies and a high cost
was paid to procure expensive technological facilities.
However, less attention was paid to the digestion, absorption,

to the supportive base for technological development. In some
cases, technology transfer to increase energy efficiencies
achieved a one-off step of efficiency improvement, but disre-
garded that reversion to previous patterns of efficiency must be
prevented and failed to ensure the basis for a continuing and
self-sustained path of improving efficiency in the future. In
conclusion, the process of development, application, and dis-

unprecedented manner. In particular, both intra- and intergen-

anthropogenic emissions and accumulations of GHGs might
significantly perturb a critical global subsystem—the atmos-

influence both climate change mitigation and adaptation, but
are of a broader scope than strategies specifically related to cli-

"The main point here is that climate change and sustainable
development are rooted in very different disciplines, which
results in distinct conceptual frameworks and policy assess-

change has constructed it as an environmental problem, which
can be identified and managed objectively by means of scien-
tific rationality. This formulation has resulted in a number of
“value neutral” decision-making approaches and methods that
represent only the technical dimension of a much more com-
plex set of decision-making problems (Jaeger et al., 1998).
These are not especially helpful in deciding how to respond
politically, because they ignore the human dimensions of the
problem and the difficult and locally differentiated politics of
responding to it. In contrast, the human-centred sustainable
development approach to environmental problems is more
politically and geographically sensitive, but it is analytically
vague. This makes it difficult to define or implement in prac-

so far has formally been accepted for serious consideration in
government agendas. Sustainable development has not yet
been able to translate its ideals into concrete objectives for
problem solving and decision making. In this context, scien-
tists are confronted with the urgent task of “reforming the rela-
tionship between science research and policymaking” (Rayner
and Malone, 1998b). This task implies a twofold effort. First,
the sustainable development discourse needs greater analytical
and intellectual rigor (methods, indicators, etc.) to make the
concept advance from theory to practice. Second, the climate
change discourse needs to be aware of both the restrictive set
of assumptions that underlie the tools and methods applied in

applied science is able to manage problems by means of stan-

task of analysts and decision makers is to work out the optimal
strategies by searching for the maximum utility among a num-
ber of options (Mintzberg, 1994). Since consensus on the prob-
lem definition and values at stake are assumed, the proposed
solutions speak for themselves, and the implementation just
requires their translation from the technical language of scien-

"The main contribution of post-normal science to policy analy-

cannot provide certainty for policy recommendations; and the
conflicting values in any decision process cannot be ignored,
even in the problem-solving work itself (Jaeger et al., 1998;
Rayner and Malone, 1998b). The epistemological analysis of
the approach shows that the insertion of technocratic discourse
into a broader social discourse and participation is not only
possible, but also necessary to improve the substantive quality
of decisions. At the practical level, the post-normal concept
lays out a DMF for articulating new institutional arrangements
in which power sharing between conventional decision-making
agents and extended peer communities is a key element (De
Marchi and Ravetz, 1999; Healy, 1999). This is not merely
motivated by a “democratic sentiment”, but by the conviction
that the resultant decisions, although not necessarily economi-

judged by a broad range of competing social criteria (Rayner

the values at stake are plural and conflicting, and even the very

constraints to the social progress, but as issues inherent to the
structure itself of societies, so even the idea itself of finding a
solution no longer applies, since problems are not solved but
managed (Tognetti, 1999). Therefore, the process of integrat-

strategies in which decision making takes on a new complex-

scape rather than charting a scientific course to an end point.
Decisions must be made about which of the systemic possibil-
ities to promote and which to discourage, how to deal with
uncertainties, and what risks to take considering irreversible
changes and potential bifurcation points. These decisions must
be informed by science, but in the end they are an expression

"A substantial body of work on participatory approaches to the
decision making process has emerged in the 1990s. Theoretical
roots of this resurgence originate in the Frankfurt School of
Critical Theory and, more concretely, in Habermas’ ideas of
discursive ethics (Habermas, 1979; O’Hara, 1996). Discursive
ethics views rationality as a social construction, inseparably
linked to and informed by the human experience of a social,
cultural, and ecological life world, which constitutes the con-
text of human experience. It presupposes no norms other than
the acceptance of a reasoned, reflective, and practical potential
for discourse: that is, the mutual recognition and acceptance of
others as “response-able” subjects (O’Hara, 1996). The main
contribution of discursive ethics is to offer a conceptual frame-
work for making visible the hidden normative assumptions,
behaviours, and motivations that influence de facto decision-

decision-making levels, the situation is no more encouraging.
It is true that sustainable development and climate change are
primarily the responsibility of the government system simply
because national economy-wide policies have widespread
effects on the regulation of societal processes. As discussed
above (Section 10.3.2.2), government policies shape structural
changes in the production systems, affect the spatial distribu-

behavioural patterns of the population, and regulate interaction
with the environment and resource-base system. However, as
recognized (Jaeger et al., 1998; Rayner and Malone, 2000) all

power have a small impact on or even no connection with the

local communities, associations, movements, and NGOs in the
public decision-making process. Increasing concern of local
populations directly affected by environmental problems,

weakening of authoritarian practices, especially in many devel-

more active participation of civil society in the public policy
formulation and decision process. Present trends towards reas-

together with the process of transferring the provision of ser-

"Despite the resurgence of interest in public participation, no
widely accepted consistent method has emerged to evaluate the
success of individual processes or the desirability of many par-
ticipatory methods. Diverse perspectives together with coun-
try-specific conditions favour different forms of participation.
In most developed societies, participatory discourse has been
motivated by public concerns on the rigid and constraining
forms of technocratic decision-making practices, and their
institutionalized forms of bureaucracy and social control.
Following Beierle (1998), divergent models of the role of civil
society in decision making arise from differences of view on
the nature of democracy. A managerial perspective acknowl-
edges public preferences as vital to the managerial role of
democratic institutions in identifying and pursuing the com-
mon good, but public participation in decision making conveys
the threat of self-interested strategic behaviour. Under a plural-
istic perspective there is no objective “common good”, but a
relative common good that arises out of the free deliberation
and negotiation among organized interest groups. The role of
the government is arbitration among these groups. Lastly, a
popular perspective calls for the direct participation of citizens
as a mechanism to instil democratic values in citizens and
strengthen the body politic. Each view provides different forms

in Section 10.4.5.

"In this section a selected set of key policy-relevant scientific
questions is examined in some detail. It surveys new develop-
ments and new results to foster our ability to make critical
choices in climate policy, such as striking the right balance
between mitigation and adaptation, the timing and location of
actions, the costs of actions, and options to reduce and share
them. After a brief discussion of the broad climate policy port-
folio, the focus is on mitigation questions. The issues involved
in these policy responses are structured as follows.
"	Text
"Towards what objective should the response be targetted?
Current analyses of climate change impacts, adaptations, and
mitigation normally cover the range between 450 and
850ppmv CO,-equivalent concentration or an increase of
between 1°C and 6°C in the global mean temperature.
Completing the circle that started with the discussion of how
the costs and benefits of balancing mitigation and adaptation
activities influence the choice of the climate and/or GHG sta-
bilization target, the issue of high versus low levels of stabi-
lization is raised again in Section 10.4.6.

"Where should the response take place? Closely related to the
timing issue, the location of mitigation responses is a multifac-
etted concern also. While the environmental value of a given
amount of unreleased GHG is equal wherever its abatement
takes place, there are far-reaching implications of whether and
to what extent nations are allowed to use international flexibil-
ity instruments. The questions range from cost and efficiency
concerns, to incentives for technological development, to
implementation and verification problems. Section 10.4.4 sum-
marizes some of the aspects.

"Involving citizens in the decision-making process is not an
easy task. It requires careful planning, thoughtful preparation,
and flexibility to change procedures on the demand of affected
stakeholders. The selection of a supportive and conducive
structure for public discourse is essential, not only to gain pub-
lic acceptance, but also to take advantage of the full potential
to articulate well-balanced decisions (Renn ef al., 1993).
Setting aside technical aspects and contextual differences, par-
ticipatory forms of decision making are viewed as proper
mechanisms to achieve broader social goals (Beierle, 1998).
These are to inform and educate the public, incorporate public
values, assumptions, and preferences into decision making,
increase the substantive quality of decisions, foster trust in
institutions, and reduce conflict among stakeholders.
"	Text
"Impoverished and marginalized areas in developing countries
have been the main targets for promoting participatory forms
of decision making. The rationale is straightforward: these seg-
ments of population are generally the less educated and less
organized, they are more difficult to reach, and the institutions
that serve them are often weak. A range of participatory meth-
ods better adapted to work at the field level have been designed
to engage and enable the poor to become active actors in devel-
opment programmes. These include workshop-based and com-
munity-based methods for collaborative decision making,
methods for stakeholder consultation, and methods for incor-
porating participation and social analysis into project design.
Based on a World Bank (1996) survey of participatory meth-
ods, Table 10.5 summarizes some of relevant participatory
tools.

"Participatory forms in decision making carry a distinct conno-
tation in developing countries. They are rooted in the idea of
grassroots participation, promoted by international develop-
ment aid agencies since 1990 (UNDP, 1992). The concept is far
from new, but in recent years it has received a different conno-
tation. Before, participation was considered as an extension of
partnership between governmental institutions and develop-
ment institutions at the operational level. The scheme was ori-
ented mainly to relieve the state of some of its executorial
responsibilities without any effective form of decisional decen-
tralization (Lazarev, 1994). Participatory development as it is
envisaged today aims to renew these ideas of partnership, but
to give due recognition to the role of local populations by let-
ting them generate, share, and analyze information, establish
Priorities, specify objectives, and develop tactics (World Bank,
1996). It is viewed as a social learning process within which
stakeholders, by generating and internalizing their own aspira-
tions, themselves enable a social change process.

"It is recognized increasingly that the impacts of global climate
change are not determined solely by the physical characteris-
tics of events. They also depend on the society’s ability to
adapt to changing patterns of the geophysical environment, as
indicated by the analyses of documented impacts of historical
climate hazards (Meyer et al., 1998). Larger damages and
higher losses of life are caused by extreme weather events in
poor regions compared to similar events in affluent regions.
Thus damages are not only a function of climatic change pat-
terns. They are strongly influenced by economic, institutional,
and technical development, which determine the capacity to
adapt to changing patterns, as well as by exogenous shifts in
socioeconomic conditions, such as population growth (Tol and
Fankhauser, 1998).

"Even if mitigation efforts do succeed, adaptation strategies are
considered to be reasonable because ancillary benefits inde-
pendent of climate change might result (Pielke, 1998).
Exploring adaptation strategies and the way in which people in
“homes, factories, and fields” can be empowered institutional-
ly and technologically to change their practice of living may,
next to the generation of short-term benefits, contribute to sub-
stantial emission reductions, as well as to the development of
strategies to cope with general aspects of global change and
thus improve their ability to flexible (re)action. Hence, bottom-
up analysis can be viewed as a necessary complementary tool
in examining climate impacts with respect to top-down
schemes employed in the derivation of national GHG emission
reduction targets conducted by expert groups (Rayner and
Malone, 1998a).

"What adaptation and mitigation actions have in common is that
they both avoid climate change damages. So far the debate
about climate change policy has been dominated by emission
reduction activities. The strong bias towards mitigation
schemes has resulted in a relatively poor incorporation of adap-
tive response strategies into climate change analysis, although
methods on how to evaluate and assess adaptive response
strategies have already been elaborated (Feenstra et al., 1998;
Parry and Carter, 1998). The reasons for this are diverse.
Adaptation has been associated with an attitude of fatalism and
acceptance. Putting too much emphasis on adaptation strate-
gies might raise the notions that mitigation efforts have little
effect, that climate change is inevitable, and/or that mitigation
measures are unnecessary. Approaching the climate issue from
the adaptive side might inhibit concerted rational action by
governments, as adaptation measures are conducted and

"Whereas mitigation deals with the causes of climate change,
adaptation tackles the consequences. As a result, the distribu-
tion of benefits from mitigation and adaptation policies is fun-
damentally different in terms of damage avoided. Mitigation
will have only a long-term global impact on climate change
damage, while adaptation options usually generate a positive
effect in a shorter term. Adaptation activities mainly benefit
those who implement them, while gains from mitigation activ-
ities accrue also to those who have not invested into the abate-
ment policies. Mitigation is plagued by the free-rider problem
and might create severe problems for decision making as
opposed to adaptation, in which free-riding is much more lim-
ited. Hence, the output of mitigation activities can be viewed
as a global public good, while the output of adaptation mea-
sures is either a private good in the case of autonomous adap-
tation or a regional or national public good in the case of pub-
lic strategies (Callaway et al., 1998; Leary, 1999). Mitigation
policies at the global scale are efficient only if all major emit-
ters implement their accepted reduction commitments. In con-
trast, most adaptation policies are carried out by those for
whom averted damage exceeds the respective costs (Jepma and
Munasinghe, 1998).

costs of controlling GHG emissions against those of adapting
explicitly to any level of climate change. Tol and Fankhauser
(1998) give an overview of IAMs and their treatment of adap-
tation strategies (Table 10.6). Tol et al. (1998) approximate that
about 7%-25% of the estimated global damage costs may be
attributed to adaptation activities.

"In general, the integrated analysis of adaptation options is a
rather complex process because all socioeconomic trends
affect the vulnerability to climate change and vulnerability
determines the optimal level of adaptation. Even without adap-
tation, impact assessments vary depending on the socioeco-
nomic development projected for the future. Studies that exam-
ine the avoided damage under different emissions reduction
targets (i.e., different costs of mitigation) and compare them
with the costs of adaptation options are yet to be developed.
"	Text
"Giving policy advice on the basis of the efficiency concept
within the IAM framework is often difficult, partly because
IAMs capture only some elements of the potential coping
strategies and are, thus, biased towards mitigation activities,
and partly because damage estimates still have a rather low
confidence (Tol, 1999a, 1999b). Nevertheless, IAMs are a use-
ful tool in exploring the implications of new types of policies.
They help to manage scientific knowledge and give insights
into the major driving forces for present and future develop-
ment with respect to social, economic, and ecological struc-
tures (Rotmans and Dowlatabadi, 1998).
"	Text
"Another observation is that adaptation options are typically
analyzed for a given amount of climate change independent of
mitigation considerations (Fankhauser, 1996). Here the aim is
to find the amount of adaptation necessary to minimize the net
damage that results from a given level of climate change.
Analysts often include predetermined adaptation options in an
ad-hoc manner, and so there is a tendency to underestimate
adaptive capacity. These analyses have been widely carried out
and are reasonably well understood in the field of agricultural
and coastal impacts, at least in some developed countries
(Fankhauser, 1995a; Yohe et al. 1996; Mendelsohn and
Schlesinger, 1997; Mendelsohn and Neumann, 1999).
"	Text
"The critical aspect of the efficiency approach is that it is only
partially optimal because the level of climate change, which
depends on the level of mitigation, is exogenous (Callaway et
al., 1998). Thus, this approach does not take into account that
the emissions causing climate change are the result of exter-
nalities and therefore are not optimal. From this perspective, to
correct the emissions’ externality through mitigation is the first
answer. However, the need for adaptation measures remains
valid because of the adverse climate change effects that are
already unavoidable. Strategies that incorporate both mitiga-
tion and adaptation are likely to be more efficient for limiting
the damages of climate change than strategies that pursue only
one or the other form of action.

"important to recognize the potential economic trade-off
between mitigation and adaptation strategies. This trade-off
entails the use of scarce resources in mitigation activities, like
restructuring a nation’s energy system, versus adaptation
strategies, like protection against changing flood and/or
drought patterns or sea-level rise. More generally, the trade-off
implies greater or lesser stresses from climate change to be
adapted to, depending on the level of mitigation effort. The
question then is to what extent governments should focus on
mitigation and adaptation strategies, recognizing that adapta-
tion and mitigation decisions would generally not be made by
the same entities. This implies that the search for the best pos-
sible combination of adaptation and mitigation strategies is a
complex process.
"	Text
"Several approaches from different angles are possible to
answer this question. From an economic point of view, the task
is to compare the marginal costs and benefits of both strategies,
and—in an optimization framework—minimize the overall
welfare loss or macroeconomic costs. Following the heuristic
principle of precaution would imply precautionary investments
in both mitigation and adaptation to hedge against the uncer-
tainties involved in climate change. However, there is little
guidance in the discussion of the precautionary approach
regarding how to operationalize critical levels of GHG emis-
sions. Furthermore, the success of climate change policy
depends on institutional structures and constraints that need to
be analyzed with respect to the feasibility of mitigation and/or
adaptation strategies.
"	Text
"From a global optimization perspective, the aim of coping with
climate change is to determine the optimal scope and amount
of adaptation and mitigation measures and thus to minimize the
resultant global welfare loss. In this context, the quantity of
adaptation depends on the level of mitigation, but the perceived
level and costs of adaptation influence the level of mitigation.
The task is then to set the share of mitigation and adaptation
costs within the overall costs, which include the residual dam-
age costs (Fankhauser, 1996; Jepma and Munasinghe, 1998).
In the [AMs, which use a cost-benefit framework, the optimal
mitigation and adaptation levels are theoretically resolved by
comparing the marginal costs of further action with the mar-
ginal benefits of avoided damage. Many uncertainties charac-
terize this framework, such as sector- and country-specific
damage functions, and adaptation options and their costs are
largely unknown, especially in developing countries.
Assumptions and data behind the mitigation cost functions dif-
fer widely as well, as explained in previous chapters.

ary principle implies an emphasis on the need to prevent such

which are, plausibly, that humankind would rather be risk
averse than risk neutral or risk seeking if one considers, for
instance, future climate-induced loss of GNP (Pearce, 1994;
Jaeger et al., 1998). Hence, attitudes towards risk play a key
role in decision making under uncertainty. However, one
might also favour prevention to cure even where one is certain
about the damage.

of these uncertainty aspects may be irreducible in principle,
and hence decision makers will have to continue to take action
under significant uncertainty, so the problem of climate change
evolves as a subject of risk management in which strategies are

"Aspects of uncertainty are associated with each link of the
causal chain of climate change, beginning with GHG emis-
sions, covering damage caused by climate change, followed by
a set of mitigation and adaptation measures (Jepma and
Munasinghe, 1998). In particular, damage-function estimates
are prone to low confidence as they involve uncertainty in both
natural and socioeconomic systems. To quantify the impact of
climate change on flora and fauna needs consideration of many
effects because of the complexity of the biological and ecolog-
ical systems. Similarly, the manner in which humans adapt to
climate change is not well known, socioeconomic modules are
still at a stage of low disaggregation, and damage as a function
of vulnerability, adaptation and time-dependency is poorly
understood (Tol et a/., 1998; Tol, 1999a, 1999b).
"	Text
"However, following the precautionary principle, uncertainty is
not an argument for delaying action, as the UNFCCC acknowl-
edges in Article 3.3: parties should “take precautionary mea-
sures to anticipate, prevent or minimize the causes of climate
change and mitigate its adverse effects. Where there are threats
of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific cer-
tainty should not be used as a reason for postponing such mea-
sures...” (UNFCCC, 1993). Pursuing this principle, mitigation
and adaptation measures are to be implemented before full
information is available and uncertainties regarding the scope
and timing of climate change are resolved. Yet, the question of
timing and extent of mitigation and/or adaptation policies
remains unquantified by the precautionary principle (Portney,
1998).

"Different levels of globally agreed limits for climate change (or
for atmospheric GHG concentrations, as frequently discussed),

and future learning, climate stabilization will inevitably be an
iterative process. Nation states will determine their own
national targets based on their own exposure and their sensi-
tivity to other countries’ exposure to climate change. The glob-
al target emerges from consolidating national targets, possibly
involving side payments, in global negotiations.
Simultaneously, agreement on burden sharing and the agreed

"Striking the appropriate balance between mitigation and adap-
tation will be a tedious process. The need for, and extent and
costs of adaptation measures in any region will be determined
by the magnitude and nature of regional climate change as a
local manifestation of global climate change. How global cli-
mate change unfolds will be determined by the total amount of
GHG emissions that, in turn, reflects nations’ willingness to
undertake mitigation measures. Toth (unpublished) points out
that balancing mitigation and adaptation efforts largely
depends on how mitigation costs are related to net damages
(primary or gross damage minus damage averted through adap-
tation plus costs of adaptation). Both mitigation costs and net
damages, in turn, depend on some crucial baseline assump-
tions: economic development and baseline emissions largely
determine emission reduction costs, while development and
institutions influence adaptive capacity.

"Although there are many country-specific differences in the
relationships between national, regional, and local govern-
ments, most analysts consider local authorities to be the salient
political actors. In addition to acting on their own, local gov-
ernments serve as an interface between citizens and the nation
state, and they are in regular contact with members of the com-
munity. O’Riordan et al. (1998) suggest that, as the need for
more effective climate policy emerges, it might be useful to
broaden the national response strategy to incorporate the local
levels and so stimulate the very effective informal institutional
dynamics of individuals and households. The rise in the num-
ber of informal networks of co-operation dispersed via schools,
universities, religious communities and other social groups is
regarded as an important step towards including climate
change awareness into people’s everyday concerns. This is of
great importance, as the individual costs of contributing to cli-
mate change are less than the consequent social costs, and thus
individual agents generate a changing climate that is socially
suboptimal. Becoming aware of the gap between individual
and social rationality is assumed to stimulate effective mitiga-
tion and adapation measures.

"Mitigation and adaptation decisions related to anthropogeni-
cally induced climate change differ. Mitigation decisions
involve many countries, disperse benefits globally over
decades to centuries (with some near-term ancillary benefits),
are driven by public policy action, based on information avail-
able today, and the relevant regulation will require rigorous
enforcement. In contrast, adaptation decisions involve a short-
er time span between outlays and returns, related costs and
benefits accrue locally and their implementation involves local
public policies and private adaptation of the affected social
agents, both based on improving information. Local mitigation
and adaptive capacities vary significantly across regions and
over time. A portfolio of mitigation and adaptation policies will
depend on local or national priorities and preferred approaches
in combination with international responsibilities.

"Wigley et al. (1996) refer to the inertia of the capital stock.
Researchers also identified other fields of inertia such as tech-
nological developments and lifestyles. The essential point of
inertia in economic structures and processes is that it incurs
costs to deviate from it and these costs rise with the speed of
deviation. Such changes are often irreversible. The costs stem
from premature retirement of the capital stock, sectoral unem-
ployment, switching cost of existing capital, and rising prices
of scarce investment goods. Emissions reduction in the present
influences the marginal abatement cost in the future. The iner-
tia of technological development arises from the path depen-
dence. The capital stock can be divided into three parts. First,
end-use equipment with a relatively short lifetime can be
replaced within a few years. Second, infrastructure, buildings,
and production processes can be replaced in up to 50 years.
Structures of urban form and urban land-use can only be
changed over 100 years. The demand and supply of goods and
services in these three domains are interrelated in a complex
way (Grubb et al., 1995; Grubb, 1997; Jaccard et al., 1997).

"In the debate on weaker versus stronger early mitigation, the
modelling of technological change and the resultant costs of
the available mitigation technologies at any given time has far
more influence when there is explicit consideration of damages
from climate change. Many models assume an exogenous
aggregated trend parameter, the rate of autonomous energy
efficiency improvement. Other authors indicate phenomena
such as inertia, lock-in, and the diversity of factors that affect
the rate of technological development and diffusion. Energy
technologies are changing and improved versions of existing
technologies are becoming available, even without policy
intervention. Modest early deployment of rapidly improving
technologies allows learning-curve cost reductions, without
premature lock-in to existing, low-productivity technology.
Both the development of radically advanced technologies
require investment in basic research and incremental improve-

"A broad range of mitigation responses can be conceived.
However, the bulk of attention, in both the analytical and poli-
cy arenas, has been devoted to reducing the emission of GHGs
from anthropogenic sources and to removing the CO, (the most
important GHG) already in the atmosphere by enhancing the
biophysical processes that capture it. The timing of these
efforts depends partly on the climatic constraints to be
observed and on the costs of these actions, which are subject to
change over time. Even with an exact knowledge of the timing
and consequences of the future impacts of climate change, pol-
icymakers will still be faced with difficult choices regarding
the implementation of response options. This is because the
costs, availability, and associated impacts of future mitigation
options are uncertain, and the choices involve trade-offs with
important competing environmental and other social objec-
tives. Chapter 8 (Section 8.1.4) discusses the costs of different
pathways towards a fixed stabilization objective, and notes fac-
tors which would favour a larger proportion of preparatory
activities relative to mitigation per se as well as factors that
favour early mitigation. This section considers the wider con-

An important implication of the debate on spiky versus smooth
stabilization paths? is that relatively high emissions in the near
term, especially for higher stabilization targets, may produce
faster rates of climate change in the early 224 century. There
is little reliable information on what kind and how much risk

"Chapters 8 discusses various possibilities to capture low-cost
options, such as revenue recycling, integration of climate with
non-climate policies to achieve ancillary benefits, and the
availability of no regrets options. Such possibilities would be
in favour of near term actions. For example, revenue recycling
has been proposed as one instrument to reduce the costs of, and
thus in support, of near-term emission reductions. In addition
to the environmental considerations, this argument relates to
the numerous distortions from taxes and subsidies in virtually
all countries. Economy-wide effects of carbon taxes, and espe-
cially the double-dividend issue, are highly debated. Much
enthusiasm has been given to “green taxes”, such as the carbon
tax, which might reduce the inefficiency of the current tax sys-
tems and lead to environmental improvements. Recent analy-
ses show that the ultimate fiscal effect of substituting carbon
taxes for other distortionary taxes is roughly neutral
(Nordhaus, 1998), but the actual sign depends on the original
size of the distortions in the economy. It may be positive in
economies with highly distorted tax systems and hence con-
firm the double dividend hypothesis (see Chapter 8). It is like-
ly to be negative in economies with less pre-existing distor-

"This line of research investigates whether the choice of emis-
sion paths that lead to the same concentration target makes a
difference in damages. In nearly all IAMs, climate damages
depend on the magnitude of temperature change, but not on its
rate. Experts point out that, because of the difficulties or high-
er costs of adaptation in some impact sectors, net damages
could be higher for a relatively faster climate change.
Moreover, some large-scale geophysical systems, like ocean
circulation, may also be sensitive to the rate of temperature
change (see IPCC, 2001a). To explore the former issue, Tol
(1996; 1998a) used the Climate Framework for Uncertainty,
Negotiations and Distribution (FUND) model for different
damage functions and conducted an extensive sensitivity
analysis with respect to the discounting rate, the power of the
damage function, the optimal temperature for the level variant,
and memory of damages in the rate variant. The results are
ambiguous, but the flat path (early mitigation) is preferable in
a significantly larger number of cases. This entails, for exam-
ple, early reductions for discount rates of 0% and 3%, but not
for 10%. If the optimal temperature increase exceeds pre-
industrial levels by 3°C, early reduction is not required. Tol
finds that impact costs for the spiky path are typically less than
20% higher than those of the smooth path. However, the dif-
ferences are larger when impact costs also depend on the rate
of change, when the exponent of the damage function is high-
er, and when the rate variant includes memory of damages.
"	Text
"Some models focus on the problem of near-term mitigation
measures under long-term uncertain concentration targets,
when the capital stock is inert. In these models, the equation
for mitigation costs incorporates—beside the common perma-
nent costs—an additional term to represent the transition costs,
which are indicators for the inertia of the system. The costs in
this field are typically calculated by comparing paths of imme-
diate and of delayed reduction (usually 20 years). The latter is
an approximation to the spiky path. In models that incorporate
only one production sector, costs depend on the inertia of the
system, the delay of reduction measures, and the concentration
targets. For a concentration target of 450ppmv, mitigation costs
may rise by 70% if the inertia is high (50 years characteristic
time), compared to the lower (20 years) inertia of an increase
by 25%-32%. The transition costs are more important than the
permanent costs until 2050, with a maximum of 1.4% of Gross
World Product (GWP) in 2040 and decline to zero until 2070.
With respect to uncertain concentration targets, the results are
most sensitive to inertia. Emissions reduction are double those
of corresponding cases with a certain concentration target; for
example, 9%-14% compared to 3%-7% in 2020 under a
550ppmv concentration goal (Ha-Duong ef al., 1997; see also
Grubb ef al., 1995; Grubb, 1997). In a sectorally disaggregat-
ed model with two sectors of different inertias, the abatement
levels are roughly the same, but the cost burden lies primarily
in the more flexible sector. The costs are higher and the differ-
ences are more distinctive in the delayed cases compared to the
immediate control cases. The sensitivity decreases with the
concentration target. Analysts, however, warn that such models
and results are still preliminary.

"In principle, two different mechanisms achieve where-flexibil-
ity: allowances and credit baseline. In the case of allowances,
each participant starts with an initial endowment of pollution
rights distributed by the government or through an auction.
Emission rights must cover each unit of emission. This system
has the character of emissions trading. Under a credit-baseline
system, each participant has a baseline (i.e., a counterfactual,
hypothetical emission trend) at the country, sector, or project
level. Some measures are undertaken to reduce emissions. The
difference between the baseline and the factual emissions is
credited by an institutional body and can be traded. This sys-

where-flexibility: IET embodies the allowance system, while

mitment period. As for JI, Article 6 declares that Annex I par-
ties with commitments listed in Annex B are allowed to trans-
fer or acquire emission reduction units that result from projects
during the commitment period (the reduction units are specific
to countries; these parties have national baselines). Finally,
CDM as defined in Article 12 implies that, starting in 2000,
Annex I parties listed in Annex B are allowed to acquire certi-
fied emission reductions from projects within the jurisdictions
of non-Annex I parties.

"Inquiries into the options and costs to reduce GHGs, especial-
ly CO,, emissions indicate that the costs of reductions vary
substantially across sectors in any given national economy and,
perhaps even more significantly, across countries. This implies
that for uniformly mixing pollutants like GHGs the costs of
achieving any given level of environmental protection could be
reduced if emission reductions were undertaken at locations
where the associated costs are lowest. The concept has become
known as “where-flexibility” in the climate policy literature.
An institutional setting is required to exploit the opportunities
of where flexibility, which involves a great variety of private
and public decision-makers who originate from different cul-
tures, represent different constituencies (if any), and live in
systems with different social norms. Where-flexibility entails
linkages both to other international agreements (GATT, Second
European Sulphur Protocol, etc.) and to the legal systems of
individual nations. As a result of its effects on relative prices,
the choice between the international or domestic strategy also

Environmental effectiveness. All units traded should be
backed by sound data and verifiable emissions reduc-
tions; the use of the mechanisms is a means to achieve
emission commitments agreed under the Protocol and
the mechanisms should be designed to improve envi-
ronmental performance and compliance with these
commitments.

Economic efficiency. This includes the cost-effective-
ness of the emission reductions required by the
Protocol, and over the longer term helping the commu-
nity of nations to address climate change in a least-cost
manner. It also requires the mechanisms to be adminis-
tratively feasible, such that they do not impose exces-
sive transaction costs on market actors. Economic effi-
ciency will also improve if the market for trading and
crediting is accessible to a wide range of potential play-
ers.

Equity. While the main issue of equity under the Kyoto
Protocol is the determination of assigned amounts or
emission targets, the design of the implementation
mechanism must also be perceived as equitable.
Implementation of the mechanisms should not give an
unfair advantage to any party or group of parties to the
disadvantage of others (procedural equity). It should
also allow new entrants over time.

Credibility. Only a credible market mechanism should
be used by the parties and will be accepted by the pub-
lic. A mechanism of low credibility might be a source
of various coalition formations at the negotiations and
might undermine the will to comply with the commit-
ments.

international mechanisms, then the nations might be willing to
accept deeper GHG-reduction commitments. This argument
does not hold in countries with potential hot air when a coun-

lower than its entitlement, so that a marketable good (emission
permit) is created without the need for any effective reduction
effort whatsoever. Nevertheless, members of the so-called
“umbrella group”, including the USA, Japan, Australia, Russia,

This argument is related to the positive allocative effects
caused by trade. The argument is fundamentally dependent on
the assumption of differences in the marginal reduction costs
between countries in a well-defined market. This might lead to
gains arising from trade for both sides. Trade reduces the over-
all costs of compliance with any specified set of international-
ly accepted reduction targets. Lile et al. (1999) and Edmonds
et al. (1996) find the rationale for Annex I countries is that
reduction costs in developing countries are much lower than
their own. Ellerman et al. (1998) and Holtsmark and Hagem
(1998) arrive at similar conclusions. However, some bottom-
up, project-based country studies that quantify national mitiga-
tion-cost curves and the consequences (e.g., Jackson (1995);
EC 1999)) identify lower mitigation costs in developed coun-
tries and thus smaller cost differences internationally. Table

This argument is related to the political, social, and economic
barriers to making use of no regrets potentials in developed
countries. The possibility to fulfil their commitments by using
CDM and/or JI might be more favourable for developed coun-
tries than to explore and utilize no regrets opportunities. The
potential of no-regrets in developing countries affects the prin-
ciple of additionality and is therefore a problem in accepting
CDM and JI projects (Rentz, 1998).

 
"	Text
"In this context, an optimal baseline strategy is required that
(first of all) takes into account the high volume of projects that
will be needed for the flexible mechanisms to achieve their
main objective of an (overall) environmental effectiveness.
The balance is likely to be achieved by optimizing baseline
stringency and minimizing project complexity (as long as the
ability to determine “what would have happened otherwise” is
not compromised). The reasoning is that a higher number of
effective projects will be more beneficial for the environment

Corruption is an important problem in several countries on
both sides of the JI and CDM relationships. The negative con-
sequence of corruption is that institutional settings are under-
mined, especially when hard currency is involved. In many
developing countries with weak democratic institutions, politi-
cians have strong incentives to maximize the financial flows
and to ignore potential negative consequences. Heller (1995)
points out that higher financial inflows from donor countries
might result in shrinking domestic environmental budgets, so
that no real emissions reduction occurs.
"	Text
"Turning to the second problem area, the efficient allocation of
markets can be distorted by transaction costs associated with
searching for partners, and the costs of contracting and negoti-
ations (see Stavins, 1995). Price distortions result when large
nations and corporations exercise market power (Hahn, 1984;
Hagem and Westskog, 1998), or asymmetric information dis-
tribution between partners in JI or CDM projects is exploited
by one of them (Hagem, 1996). It is well known that each of
these deviations from the ideal world of competitive markets
might lead to inefficient allocations. Other factors at work
include the initial distribution of property rights, which might
also reflect equity considerations.
"	Text
"The next problem is that each implemented project—especial-
ly a large one—affects the baseline in other parts of the econ-
omy. Jackson (1995) warns that this might implicate a multi-
level system of baselines in the overall economy, sectors, and
projects. Clearly, projects have to be monitored. Thus the polit-
ical problem of creating guidelines for monitoring and the
technical issue of registration arise. Furthermore, credible
enforcement or penalization against cheating or non-fulfilling
parties needs to be established, probably in the form of a spe-
cial body for ascertainment (Janssen, 1999). A reliable basis of
international law for contracting is essential, especially among
private actors. Even if all these conditions are fulfilled, the
problem of corruption might make the instrument inefficient or
flawed outright. With respect to such problems Barrett (1998)
raises the question whether the Kyoto Protocol will be imple-
mented at all by any parties if every party believes that other
parties do not obey the rules and follow their own commit-
ments.
"	Text
"The production character of CDM and JI requires a fixed base-
line to be defined. The baseline provides an incentive to cheat
by setting it unrealistically high so that the efficacy of the
instrument decreases because no real reduction takes place.
The possibility to cheat stems from the intricacies of fixing the
baseline, which usually arise through vague guidelines (politi-
cal issue) and the general problems of forecasting (technical
issue; see Michaelowa, (1995; 1998b). Begg et al. (1999) and
Parkinson ef al. (2001) examine the uncertainty associated
with baseline construction and propose it be managed through
conservative esimates, use of monitored data and verification,
and either baseline revision or limited crediting lifetimes.
Parson and Fisher-Vanden (1999) argue that the opportunity for
self-serving manipulation of project baselines will vary
markedly among project types, and suggest a likely bias in any
project-based JI system (such as the CDM) towards project
types most resistant to baseline manipulation—tetrofits and
technological carbon management. They also propose a hybrid
domestic—international system for project certification to limit
the scope for cheating.

The UNFCCC recognizes these two principles in Article 3.1.

"40 The terms “justice” and “fairness” are often used as synonyms,
however, there are debates on the different notions of the terms.
Following Albin (1995), justice means distributive justice, in the sense
of a general standard for allocating collective benefits and burdens
among the members of a community at local, national, or global lev-
els. Principles of justice exist prior to and independently of any phe-
nomenon to be judged. Fairness consists of individual perceptions of
what is reasonable under the circumstances, often in reference to how
a principle of justice regarded as pertinent should be applied.
"	Text
"Equity and efficiency considerations in the context of decision
making that addresses global climate change are important for
various reasons, including ethical concerns, effectiveness, sus-
tainable development, and implementation of UNFCCC itself
(Munasinghe, 1998; see also Chapter 1). Principles of justice
and fairness*® are important in themselves, in all types of
human interactions, and play a major role in practically all
modern international agreements, including the UN Charter;
they emphasize the basic equality of all humans (Jepma and
Munasinghe, 1998).
"	Text
"In summary, the literature on where-flexibility reveals abun-
dant opportunities to reduce the costs of emission reductions,
but also raises concerns about the implementation. However,
concerns as to whether the flexibility mechanisms of the Kyoto
Protocol can be implemented because of the possibility that
some parties may be corrupt or may cheat are universal con-
cerns. They apply not only to the countries involved in flexi-
bility mechanisms, but also to countries that take on any emis-
sions reduction commitments (although flexibility instruments
are particularly sensitive to cheating). Given the various ways
proposed to reduce the risks of their misuse, the Kyoto mech-
anisms offer the double advantage of reducing the costs of cli-
mate change mitigation and fostering non-climate objectives as
well.
"	Text
"international mechanisms may seriously limit the ultimate eco-
nomic potential of emissions trading. Most economic studies
of trading assume that trade occurs whenever there is the
potential to lower compliance costs. However, to the extent
that some countries implement their domestic strategies
through regulatory and tax measures, emissions permits
obtained through international transactions may have limited
or no value in these countries. Moreover, Hahn and Stavins
(1995) point out that domestic legislators may be concerned
about the significant financial transfers implied by emissions
trading and act to keep funds within their own borders. In
another relationship, Montgomery (1997) raises the possibility
that domestic legislators may try to impose trade barriers in an
effort to limit the competitiveness consequence implied by the
loss of capital and jobs that may accompany efforts to limit
emissions.
"	Text
"Equity principles apply to both procedural and consequential
issues (Banuri et al., 1996). Procedural issues concern the
process of how decisions are made. The two aspects of proce-
dural equity involve the effective participation in decision-
making processes and the process itself, which should be the
principle of equal treatment before the law. In this context, ref-
erence is made to Coase’s model of social cost (1960) in that
he assumes a situation of equal bargaining power among par-
ticipants and equal distribution of the costs of making the bar-
gain with respect to the internalization of externalities. The
philosophical notion of procedural equity is the “ideal speech
situation” (Habermas, 1981), a situation in which dialogue and
decision making are free from inappropriate constraints such as
barriers to the acquisition of knowledge or financial resources.
Transfer of these concepts to climate change negotiations
requires consideration of the influence of scientific informa-
tion, human resources, institutional capacities, and financial
assets on the bargaining, and a redistribution of these among
participants to create procedural equity.
"	Text
"Some authors argue that equitable decisions generally carry
greater legitimacy and encourage parties with differing inter-
ests to co-operate better in carrying out mutually agreed
actions. One of the major obstacles to reaching a comprehen-
sive agreement on global warming—setting GHG emission
limitation targets for individual countries—involves parties
that act as a “veto” because they regard particular arrange-
ments as unfair or unjust. Decisions that are widely accepted as
equitable are likely to be implemented with greater willingness
than those enforced under conditions of mistrust (Rowlands,
1997). Others find little evidence that fairness matters much.
Victor (1999) examines the relationships between fairness and
the compliance with international environmental agreements
through the lessons learned about implementation and effec-
tiveness of numerous earlier treaties. His conclusion is that
equity concerns matter little in the success of negotiating and
implementing such agreements. Even for cases in which fair-
ness seems to play some role, willingness to pay had a stronger
role. Victor argues that if parties to an agreement take the trou-
ble to deviate from the simplest across-the-board commit-
ments, then many criteria need to be considered in negotiating
commitments. Fairness might be one criterion, but is probably
not the most important.

"To answer these questions scientists have developed typologies
for the various distributional equity principles; these are under-
stood to be general concepts of distributive justice and fairness,
which often overlap. Associated burden-sharing rules, on the
other hand, represent an operational function to generate a spe-
cific scheme to reduce GHG emissions or to bear the costs of
climate change impacts. Table 10.9 gives an overview of gen-
eral equity principles and accompanying operational rules
(Thompson and Rayner, 1998).

"among and within countries (intragenerational and spatial dis-

gate climate change have to be paid for by the present genera-
tion, benefits in the sense of avoided losses will affect genera-
tions to come. This involves discounting future benefits to a net
present value (Portney and Weyant, 1999). However, most of
the potentially affected parties are not present to participate in
the decision making, so that the current generation has to dis-
cuss equity issues within climate change.

However, details of the form of JI and the endowment of GHG

ations to determine national targets after 2012, as well as the
question of commitments for developing countries, need to be

the assumptions of perfect competition, a marketable emis-
sions permit scheme with full trading will be cost-effective no
matter how the permits are distributed. It will lead to an equal-
izing of the marginal costs of emissions reduction across all
sources (Nordhaus, 1994a) and generate the same costs no mat-
ter which burden-sharing rule is applied. Hence, there is no
efficiency—equity trade-off and no obstacle to considering
equity issues within climate change while emphasizing cost-

"However, there is a strong bias towards the principle of effi-
ciency and its underlying utilitarian maxim. Also, it is impor-
tant to recognize that self-interest plays a crucial role in voting
for a specific operation rule, and that self-interests or, alterna-
tively, particular preferences are at the core of economic con-
siderations. Closely related to the concept of preferences is that
of willingness-to-pay. Developed countries usually have a
much higher willingness-to-pay in terms of solving environ-
mental problems. This is partly because willingness-to-pay
depends on the ability to pay. Consequently, it seems reason-
able that developed countries bear the primary burden involved
in mitigating climate change (Victor, 1999), as endorsed in the
Kyoto Protocol. Hence, economics in terms of efficiency is a
major aspect when negotiating emissions-limitation commit-
ments.

"the corresponding outcomes. The demand for fairness arises
from the existence of communities (social solidarity) and from
publicly shared expectations of the conduct of community rela-
tions. As communities pursue manifold ways of organizing
institutional structures and social relations, there are different
perceptions of what is equitable and fair (Rayner et al., 1999;
Rayner and Malone, 2000). Distinct moral principles generate
conflicting debates on how to share the burdens, even though
there might be equally legitimate and justified claims.
Therefore, it is very difficult to achieve a worldwide consensus
on just one justice principle. One way of reaching an accord
might be to set up a combination of the diverse equity-based
distribution proposals (Miiller, 1998). Even if agreement on a
particular first principle is reached, the question of how reduc-
tions for each country should be generated would remain unre-
solved because of the different reference bases against which
equity cirteria could be applied, such as population, land area,
GDP per capita, or emissions per capita. With respect to the
spatial distribution of GHG emissions limitation burdens,
should the burdens be laid more on the production or on the
consumption side of CO, emissions and what are the accom-
panying effects in terms of intragenerational equity (Rose and
Stevens, 1998)? In summary, manifold equity principles and
different accompanying operational rules exist; these might
best be applied as a combination to respect more than just one
equity position and thus enhance political feasibility.

"rights of GHG emissions, such as the egalitarian, sovereignty,
polluter pays, and ability-to-pay principles. The second group
of principles examines the outcome in terms of welfare
changes*! caused by emissions reduction efforts, such as the
horizontal, vertical, compensation, and utilitarian principles.
The third category recognizes the libertarian, political consen-
sus, and Rawls’ maximin as guiding principles to the process
of emission allocation. Shue (1993) divides principles of jus-
tice into “fault-based” and “no-fault” principles. The ability-to-
pay, for example, is no-fault in the sense that guilt is irrelevant
to the assignment of responsibility to pay. The richest should
pay the highest rates no matter how they acquired what they
own. In contrast, the polluter-pays principle, an economic prin-
ciple that polluters should bear the cost of abatement without
subsidy (Rayner ef al., 1999), is based upon fault or, alterna-
tively, upon an amoral rationale of causal responsibility, or
simply that the assignment of burden creates an incentive to
not pollute. Thus, fault need not be a moral issue. Rowlands
(1997) differentiates, among other things, according to aspects
of historical difference (if any). The classification is based on
whether past usage has established present and future rights, be
it the same (grandfathering) or be it a correction for injustices
from the past (natural debt). Agarwal and Narain (2000) outline
the concept of contraction and convergence. This is the entitle-
ment of GHG emissions budgets in terms of future emissions
rights. Such a global future emissions budget is based on a
global upper limit of atmospheric concentration of CO,, for
instance 450ppmv (contraction). This budget is then distrib-
uted as entitlements to emit CO, in the future, and all countries
will agree to converge on a per-capita emission entitlement
(convergence). Level of contraction and timing of convergence
are subject to negotiations with respect to the precautionary
principle.

impose trade barriers. This is another aspect of the need to link

"effectiveness. Equity rules play an important role when deter-
mining the initial distribution of emissions allowances, or the
compensation schemes, as cost-effectiveness might result in a
disproportionately high level of burden to certain groups of
countries. Attempts can be made to provide resource transfers
to compensate for the disadvantaged (Biermann, 1997).
Usually, it is assumed that mitigation costs are relatively high-
er in developed countries. Thus, trading reduces the costs to
developed countries and provide a transfer to developing coun-
tries. Yet, the magnitude of side payments needs to be consid-
ered when evaluating alternative burden-sharing rules, because
they often generate rather high transaction and/or administra-
tive costs (Burniaux, 1999). If, however, use of the flexibility
mechanisms is restricted and equalization of marginal abate-
ment costs throughout the countries cannot be fulfilled, the
choice of burden-sharing rule matters with respect to the aggre-
gate abatement costs. Furthermore, emissions trading is usual-
ly perceived to take place in a perfect market with parties hav-
ing equal opportunities of involvement. Agarwal and Narain

"Much of the debate about equity in climate change mitigation
deals with social, economic, and political issues, including
international economic development and the unequal distribu-
tion of wealth within and among countries. Views diverge
widely. Is climate change an opportunity to solve the large
problems of sustainable development and global distribution of
wealth? Or would broadening the scope for the anyway com-
plex and controversial issue of climate change run the risk of
neither solving the climate problem nor improving prospects
for sustainable development. Helm (1999) presents an analysis
of fair sharing of GHG limitation burdens by separating the cli-
mate issue from the dispute about the global welfare distribu-
tion. In contrast, Rayner and Malone (2000) pursue a holistic
approach to equity and address climate change as an arena in
which to debate a wide variety of economic and political
issues. In this context, equity is perceived as a basis for gener-
ating social capital, which is necessary, together with econom-
ic, natural, and intellectual capital, for sustainability.

"In a rational world, the ultimate level of climate and thus GHG
concentration stabilization would emerge from a political
process in which the global community would weigh mitiga-
tion costs and the averted damages associated with different
levels of stabilization. Also weighed would be the risks of trig-
gering systemic changes in large geophysical systems, like
ocean circulation, or other irreversible impacts. In reality, the
political process will inevitably be influenced by the distribu-
tion of positive and negative effects of climate change, as well
as by the costs of mitigation among countries, largely deter-
mined by how risks, costs, environmental values, and devel-
opment aspirations are weighed in different regions and cul-
tures. This process will be strongly influenced by new scien-
tific and technical knowledge and by experience gained in
making and implementing policy. The climate change litera-
ture contains a diversity of arguments as to why either a low
level or a relatively high level of stabilization is desirable
(IPCC, 2001b).
"	Text
"owing conclusions emerge:

a carefully crafted portfolio of mitigation, adaptation,
and learning activities appears to be appropriate over
the next few decades to hedge against the risk of intol-
erable magnitudes and/or rates of climate change
(impact side) and against the need to undertake painful-
ly drastic emission reductions if the resolution of uncer-
tainties reveals that climate change and its impacts
might imply high risks;

the nature of the climate change problem requires that
mitigation action at any level needs to start in the near
term, as well as the development of appropriate adapta-
tion strategies;

emission reduction is an important form of mitigation,
but the mitigation portfolio includes a broad range of
other activities, including investments to develop low-
cost non-carbon energy, and to improve energy effi-
ciency and carbon management technologies to make
future CO, mitigation inexpensive;

timing and composition of mitigation measures (invest-
ment in technological development or immediate emis-
sion reductions) is highly controversial because of the
technological features of energy systems, and the range
of uncertainties involved with, for example, their
impacts of climate change;

international flexibility instruments help reduce the
costs of emission reductions, but they raise a series of
implementation and verification issues that need to be
balanced against the cost savings;

while there is a broad consensus on Pareto optimality as
an efficiency principle, there is no agreement on the
best equity principle for burden sharing. Efficiency and
equity are important concerns in negotiating emissions
limitation schemes, and they are not mutually exclu-
sive. Therefore, equity will play an important role in
determining the distribution of emissions allowances
and/or within compensation schemes that follow emis-
sions trading resulting in a disproportionately high
level of burden to certain countries. Finally, it is more
important to rely on politically feasible burden-sharing
rules than to select one specific equity principle.

"The analytical tools to support the above decision-making
processes need to handle this double feature. They should pro-
vide policymakers with guidance to set long-term targets and
to formulate short-term policies and measures. Some models
take a long-term view to explore deep future impacts of climate
change, but this must not be interpreted as suggesting optimal
strategies for the next 50-100-200 years. Other models explore
what are the most promising near-term policies and how to
implement them. Similarly, many studies and models reviewed
in this chapter consider the world as a whole or broken down
into a few regions, at best. Others take a more detailed look at
subnational and regional aspects. They shed light on the small-
er scale implications of climate change and its management
strategies, often in the context of other social concerns charac-
terizing the country or region. Our assessment has found a
healthy diversity of DAFs along both the long-term-short term
and the global-local axes. Nevertheless, the analytical capacity
and thus quotable results are still badly missing in most devel-
oping countries. This is probably the most severe problem to be
solved by the time the world community will prepare its next
climate change assessment report.

"Considering the special combination of features of the climate
problem listed at the beginning of this chapter, it is obvious that
no “once forever” solution exists. Making long-term commit-
ments in any area where retraction is possible is problematic.
Making decisions that entail long-term and possibly irre-
versible consequences due to long delays, inertia and similar
system properties is even more difficult, especially under
severe uncertainties. Therefore, as emphasized in this chapter,
the most promising approach to climate policy is sequential
decision-making. This process involves a regular reassessment
of the long-term climate risks (net damages from a given mag-
nitude of climate change) and their management objectives
(climate or GHG concentration stabilization) in the light of
newly available information. Short-term strategies are then
crafted so that both GHG emissions and the underlying socioe-
conomic processes (resource use, technologies) evolve in a
direction which makes future course corrections in any direc-
tion the least expensive. The current structure of the interna-
tional climate regime is formulated in this vein: the UNFCCC
provides some, albeit vague, guidelines for long term stabiliza-
tion objectives while short-term goals are settled in and imple-
mented under protocols for each budget period.

Levy imposed by a government on each unit of CO,-equiva-
lent emissions by a source subject to the tax. Since virtually all
of the carbon in fossil fuels is ultimately emitted as carbon
dioxide, a levy on the carbon content of fossil fuels — a carbon
tax — is equivalent to an emissions tax for emissions caused by
to fossil fuel combustion. An energy tax — a levy on the energy
content of fuels — reduces demand for energy and so reduces
carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel use. An ecotax is
designated for the purpose of influencing human behaviour
(specifically economic behaviour) to follow an ecologically
benign path. International emissions/carbon/energy tax is a tax
imposed on specified sources in participating countries by an
international agency. The revenue is distributed or used as

"The effect that revenue-generating instruments, such as a car-
bon tax or auctioned (tradable) carbon emission permits, can
(1) limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions and (2) offset at
least part of the potential welfare losses of climate policies
through recycling the revenue in the economy to reduce other
taxes likely to be distortionary. In a world with involuntary
unemployment, the climate change policy adopted may have
an effect (a positive or negative “third dividend”) on employ-
ment. Weak double dividend occurs as long as there is a rev-
enue-recycling effect; that is, as long as revenues are recycled
through reductions in the marginal rates of distortionary taxes.
Strong double dividend requires that the (beneficial) revenue
recycling effect more than offset the combination of the prima-
ry cost and in this case, the net cost of abatement is negative.

Greenhouse gases are those gaseous constituents of the atmos-
phere, both natural and anthropogenic, that absorb and emit
radiation at specific wavelengths within the spectrum of
infrared radiation emitted by the earth’s surface, the atmos-
phere, and clouds. This property causes the greenhouse effect.
Water vapour (H,O), carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane
and ozone (O,) are the primary greenhouse gases in the earth’s
atmosphere. Moreover, there are a number of entirely human-
made greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as the halo-
carbons and other chlorine- and bromine-containing sub-
stances, dealt with under the Montreal protocol. Beside carbon
dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane, the Kyoto Protocol deals
with the greenhouse gases sulphur hexafluoride, hydrofluo-
rocarbons, and perfluorocarbons.
"	Text
"Greenhouse gases effectively absorb infrared radiation emit-
ted by the earth’s surface, by the atmosphere itself from these
same gases, and by clouds. Atmospheric radiation is emitted to
all sides, including downwards to the earth’s surface. Thus,
greenhouse gases trap heat within the surface—troposphere sys-
tem. This is called the natural greenhouse effect. Atmospheric
radiation is strongly coupled to the temperature of the level at
which it is emitted. In the troposphere the temperature gener-
ally decreases with height. Effectively, infrared radiation emit-
ted to space originates from an altitude with a temperature of,
on average, —19°C, in balance with the net incoming solar radi-
ation. However, the earth’s surface is kept at a much higher
temperature of on average +14°C. An increase in the concen-
tration of greenhouse gases leads to an increased infrared opac-
ity of the atmosphere, and therefore to an effective radiation
into space from a higher altitude at a lower temperature. This
causes a radiative forcing, an imbalance that can only be com-
pensated for by an increase in the temperature of the sur-
face—troposphere system. This is the enhanced greenhouse
effect.

policy instruments with existing domestic tax systems, includ-
ing both cost-increasing tax interaction and cost-reducing rev-

greenhouse gas policies can have on the functioning of labour
and capital markets through their effects on real wages and the
real return to capital. By restricting the allowable greenhouse
gas emissions, permits, regulations, or a carbon tax raise the
costs of production and the prices of output, thus reducing the
real return to labour and capital. For policies that raise revenue
for the government, carbon taxes and auctioned permits, the
revenues can be recycled to reduce existing distortionary taxes.

"Implementation refers to the actions (legislation or regulations,
judicial decrees, or other actions) that governments take to
translate international accords into domestic law and policy. It
includes those events and activities that occur after the issuing
of authoritative public policy directives, which include the
effort to administer and the substantive impacts on people and
events. It is important to distinguish between the legal imple-
mentation of international commitments (in national law) and
the effective implementation (measures that induce changes in
the behaviour of target groups). Compliance is a matter of
whether and to what extent countries do adhere to the provi-
sions of the accord. Compliance focuses not only on whether
implementing measures are in effect, but also on whether there
is compliance with the implementing actions. Compliance
measures the degree to which the actors whose behaviour is
targeted by the agreement, whether they be local government
units, corporations, organizations, or individuals, conform to
the implementing measures and obligations.

The process of increasing the carbon content of a carbon reser-
voir other than the atmosphere. Biological approaches to
sequestration include direct removal of carbon dioxide from
the atmosphere through /and-use change, afforestation, refor-
estation, and practices that enhance soil carbon in agriculture.
Physical approaches include separation and disposal of carbon
dioxide from flue gases or from processing fossil fuels to pro-
duce hydrogen- (H,) and carbon dioxide-rich fractions and
long-term storage underground in depleted oil and gas reser-
voirs, coal seams, and saline aquifers.

A target is the reduction of a specific percentage of greenhouse
gas emissions from a baseline date (e.g., “below 1990 levels”)
to be achieved by a set date, or timetable (e.g., 2008 to 2012).
For example, under the Kyoto Protocol’s formula, the European
Union has agreed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 8%
below 1990 levels by the 2008 to 2012 commitment period.
These targets and timetables are, in effect, an emissions cap on

These approaches analyse greenhouse gas emissions as they
would be constrained by adopting a long-term climate - rather
than greenhouse gas concentration stabilization - target (e.g.,
expressed in terms of temperature or sea level changes or the
rate of such changes). The main objective of these approaches
is to evaluate the implications of such long-term targets for
short- or medium-term “tolerable” ranges of global greenhouse
gas emissions. Also referred to as safe landing approaches.

The Kyoto Protocol states that emissions trading and Joint
Implementation activities are to be supplemental to domestic
actions (e.g., energy taxes, fuel efficiency standards, etc.)
taken by developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas
emissions. Under some proposed definitions of supplementar-
ity (e.g., a concrete ceiling on level of use), developed coun-
tries could be restricted in their use of the Kyoto mechanisms
to achieve their reduction targets. This is a subject for further
negotiation and clarification by the parties.

The terms “top-down” and “bottom-up” are shorthand for
aggregate and disaggregated models. The top-down label
derives from how modellers applied macroeconomic theory
and econometric techniques to historical data on consumption,
prices, incomes, and factor costs to model final demand for
goods and services, and supply from main sectors, like the
energy sector, transportation, agriculture, and industry.
Therefore, top-down models evaluate the system from aggre-
gate economic variables, as compared to bottom-up models
that consider technological options or project specific climate
change mitigation policies. Some technology data were, how-
ever, integrated into top-down analysis and so the distinction is
not that clear-cut.
