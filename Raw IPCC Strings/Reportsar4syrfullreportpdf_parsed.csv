"he Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was set up jointly by the World Meteorological Organization and the

United Nations Environment Programme to provide an authoritative international statement of scientific understanding of
climate change. The IPCC’s periodic assessments of the causes, impacts and possible response strategies to climate change are
the most comprehensive and up-to-date reports available on the subject, and form the standard reference for all concerned with
climate change in academia, government and industry worldwide. This Synthesis Report is the fourth element of the IPCC Fourth
Assessment Report “Climate Change 2007”. Through three working groups, many hundreds of international experts assess
climate change in this Report. The three working group contributions are available from Cambridge University Press:

"Since its establishment, the IPCC has produced a series of
Assessment Reports (1990, 1995, 2001 and this one in 2007),
Special Reports, Technical Papers and Methodology Reports,
which have become standard works of reference, widely used
by policymakers, scientists, other experts and students. The
most recent publications include a Special Report on “Car-
bon Dioxide Capture and Storage” and one on “Safeguarding
the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System”, published
in 2005, and the “Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories” re-edited in 2006. A Technical Paper on “Cli-

"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was
jointly established in 1988, by the World Meteorological Or-
ganization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP), with the mandate to assess scientific in-
formation related to climate change, to evaluate the environ-
mental and socio-economic consequences of climate change,
and to formulate realistic response strategies. The IPCC
multivolume assessments have since then played a major role
in assisting governments to adopt and implement policies in
response to climate change, and in particular have responded
to the need for authoritative advice of the Conference of the
Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which was established in
1992, and its 1997 Kyoto Protocol.

"This Synthesis Report (SYR), adopted in Valencia, Spain, on
17 November 2007, completes the four-volume Fourth As-
sessment Report (AR4), which was released in various steps
throughout the year under the title “Climate Change 2007”. It
summarises the findings of the three Working Group reports
and provides a synthesis that specifically addresses the issues
of concern to policymakers in the domain of climate change:
it confirms that climate change is occurring now, mostly as a
result of human activities; it illustrates the impacts of global
warming already under way and to be expected in future, and
describes the potential for adaptation of society to reduce its
vulnerability; finally it presents an analysis of costs, policies
and technologies intended to limit the extent of future changes
in the climate system.

"The Synthesis Report addresses a range of broad policy-rel-
evant questions, structured around 6 topic headings agreed by
the Panel, and it gives careful attention to cross-cutting themes.
It consists of two parts, a Summary for Policymakers (SPM)
and a longer report. The sections of the SPM follow largely
the topic structure of the longer report, but for brevity and
clarity, certain issues covered in more than one topic are
summarised in one section of the SPM.
"	Text
"Topic 4 describes adaptation and mitigation options and re-
sponses as assessed in the reports of Working Groups II and
III, and the inter-relationship of climate change and response
measures with sustainable development. The focus of this topic
is on response measures that can be implemented by 2030.
Technologies, policies, measures and instruments as well as
barriers to implementation are addressed along with syner-
gies and trade-offs.

"While the Synthesis Report is a largely self-contained docu-
ment, it needs to be viewed in the context of the other vol-
umes of “Climate Change 2007” and it is recommended that
for further details the contributions of the three Working
Groups be consulted. Each of the Working Group reports con-
sists of a series of chapters which contain a detailed scientific
technical assessment, a Technical Summary, and a Summary
for Policymakers that has been approved by the IPCC line by
line.

"Topic 2 addresses causes of change, considering both natural
and anthropogenic drivers of climate change. It analyses the
chain including greenhouse gas emissions and concentrations,
to radiative forcing and resultant climate change, and evalu-
ates whether observed changes in climate and in physical and
biological systems can be attributed to natural or anthropo-

There is high confidence that some hydrological systems

show that annual average Arctic sea ice extent has shrunk by

of 7.4 [5.0 to 9.8]% per decade. Mountain glaciers and snow

There is observational evidence of an increase in intense
tropical cyclone activity in the North Atlantic since about 1970,
with limited evidence of increases elsewhere. There is no clear
trend in the annual numbers of tropical cyclones. It is difficult
to ascertain longer-term trends in cyclone activity, particularly
prior to 1970. {7.1}

"It is very likely that over the past 50 years: cold days, cold
nights and frosts have become less frequent over most land
areas, and hot days and hot nights have become more frequent.
It is likely that: heat waves have become more frequent over
most land areas, the frequency of heavy precipitation events
has increased over most areas, and since 1975 the incidence
of extreme high sea level? has increased worldwide. {1.1}

"Rising sea level is consistent with warming (Figure
SPM.1). Global average sea level has risen since 1961 at an
average rate of 1.8 [1.3 to 2.3] mm/yr and since 1993 at 3.1
[2.4 to 3.8] mm/yr, with contributions from thermal expan-
sion, melting glaciers and ice caps, and the polar ice sheets.
Whether the faster rate for 1993 to 2003 reflects decadal varia-
tion or an increase in the longer-term trend is unclear. {7.1}

"In terrestrial ecosystems, earlier timing of spring events
and poleward and upward shifts in plant and animal ranges
are with very high confidence linked to recent warming. In
some marine and freshwater systems, shifts in ranges and
changes in algal, plankton and fish abundance are with high
confidence associated with rising water temperatures, as well
as related changes in ice cover, salinity, oxygen levels and
circulation. {1.2}

"Eleven of the last twelve years (1995-2006) rank among
the twelve warmest years in the instrumental record of global
surface temperature (since 1850). The 100-year linear trend

responding trend of 0.6 [0.4 to 0.8]°C (1901-2000) given in
the Third Assessment Report (TAR) (Figure SPM. 1). The tem-
perature increase is widespread over the globe and is greater
at higher northern latitudes. Land regions have warmed faster
than the oceans (Figures SPM.2, SPM.4). {/./, 1.2}

GHGs are weighted by their 100-year Global Warming Potentials, using values consistent with reporting under the UNFCCC.

® Increases in GHGs tend to warm the surface while the net effect of increases in aerosols tends to cool it. The net effect due to human activities
since the pre-industrial era is one of warming (+1.6 [+0.6 to +2.4] W/m’). In comparison, changes in solar irradiance are estimated to have
caused a small warming effect (+0.12 [+0.06 to +0.30] W/m’).

By 2020, between 75 and 250 million of people are projected to be exposed to increased water stress due t
climate change.

By 2020, in some countries, yields from rain-fed agriculture could be reduced by up to 50%. Agricultural
production, including access to food, in many African countries is projected to be severely compromised. Th
would further adversely affect food security and exacerbate malnutrition.

Towards the end of the 21* century, projected sea level rise will affect low-lying coastal areas with large
populations. The cost of adaptation could amount to at least 5 to 10% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
By 2080, an increase of 5 to 8% of arid and semi-arid land in Africa is projected under a range of climate
scenarios (TS).

By the 2050s, freshwater availability in Central, South, East and South-East Asia, particularly in large river
basins, is projected to decrease.

Coastal areas, especially heavily populated megadelta regions in South, East and South-East Asia, will be
greatest risk due to increased flooding from the sea and, in some megadeltas, flooding from the rivers.
Climate change is projected to compound the pressures on natural resources and the environment
associated with rapid urbanisation, industrialisation and economic development.

Endemic morbidity and mortality due to diarrhoeal disease primarily associated with floods and droughts
are expected to rise in East, South and South-East Asia due to projected changes in the hydrological cycle.

By 2020, significant loss of biodiversity is projected to occur in some ecologically rich sites, including the
Great Barrier Reef and Queensland Wet Tropics.

By 2030, water security problems are projected to intensify in southern and eastern Australia and, in

New Zealand, in Northland and some eastern regions.

By 2030, production from agriculture and forestry is projected to decline over much of southern and
eastern Australia, and over parts of eastern New Zealand, due to increased drought and fire. However, in
New Zealand, initial benefits are projected in some other regions.

By 2050, ongoing coastal development and population growth in some areas of Australia and New Zealand
are projected to exacerbate risks from sea level rise and increases in the severity and frequency of storms
and coastal flooding.

Climate change is expected to magnify regional differences in Europe's natural resources and assets.
Negative impacts will include increased risk of inland flash floods and more frequent coastal flooding and
increased erosion (due to storminess and sea level rise).

Mountainous areas will face glacier retreat, reduced snow cover and winter tourism, and extensive species
losses (in some areas up to 60% under high emissions scenarios by 2080).

In southern Europe, climate change is projected to worsen conditions (high temperatures and drought) in
a region already vulnerable to climate variability, and to reduce water availability, hydropower potential,
summer tourism and, in general, crop productivity.

Climate change is also projected to increase the health risks due to heat waves and the frequency of wildfires.

By mid-century, increases in temperature and associated decreases in soil water are projected to lead to
gradual replacement of tropical forest by savanna in eastern Amazonia. Semi-arid vegetation will tend to
be replaced by arid-land vegetation.

There is a risk of significant biodiversity loss through species extinction in many areas of tropical Latin America.
Productivity of some important crops is projected to decrease and livestock productivity to decline, with
adverse consequences for food security. In temperate zones, soybean yields are projected to increase.
Overall, the number of people at risk of hunger is projected to increase (TS; medium confidence).
Changes in precipitation patterns and the disappearance of glaciers are projected to significantly affect
water availability for human consumption, agriculture and energy generation.

Warming in western mountains is projected to cause decreased snowpack, more winter flooding and
reduced summer flows, exacerbating competition for over-allocated water resources.

In the early decades of the century, moderate climate change is projected to increase aggregate yields of
rain-fed agriculture by 5 to 20%, but with important variability among regions. Major challenges are
projected for crops that are near the warm end of their suitable range or which depend on highly utilised
water resources.

Cities that currently experience heat waves are expected to be further challenged by an increased
number, intensity and duration of heat waves during the course of the century, with potential for adverse
health impacts.

Coastal communities and habitats will be increasingly stressed by climate change impacts interacting
with development and pollution.

Mitigation potential is estimated using different types of approaches. Bottom-up studies are based on assessment of mitigation options,
emphasising specific technologies and regulations. They are typically sectoral studies taking the macro-economy as unchanged. Top-down
studies assess the economy-wide potential of mitigation options. They use globally consistent frameworks and aggregated information about
mitigation options and capture macro-economic and market feedbacks.

"A range of barriers limits both the implementation and
effectiveness of adaptation measures. The capacity to adapt is
dynamic and is influenced by a society’s productive base, in-
cluding natural and man-made capital assets, social networks
and entitlements, human capital and institutions, governance,
national income, health and technology. Even societies with
high adaptive capacity remain vulnerable to climate change,
variability and extremes. /4.2}

"Both bottom-up and top-down studies indicate that
there is high agreement and much evidence of sub-
stantial economic potential for the mitigation of global
GHG emissions over the coming decades that could
offset the projected growth of global emissions or re-
duce emissions below current levels (Figures SPM.9,
SPM.10).'® While top-down and bottom-up studies are
in line at the global level (Figure SPM.9) there are con-
siderable differences at the sectoral level. {4.3}

"Societies have a long record of managing the impacts of
weather- and climate-related events. Nevertheless, additional
adaptation measures will be required to reduce the adverse
impacts of projected climate change and variability, regard-
less of the scale of mitigation undertaken over the next two to
three decades. Moreover, vulnerability to climate change can
be exacerbated by other stresses. These arise from, for ex-
ample, current climate hazards, poverty and unequal access to
resources, food insecurity, trends in economic globalisation,
conflict and incidence of diseases such as HIV/AIDS. {4.2}

"Based on current model simulations, the meridional over-

slow down during the 21* century; nevertheless temperatures
over the Atlantic and Europe are projected to increase. The
MOC is very unlikely to undergo a large abrupt transition dur-
ing the 21“ century. Longer-term MOC changes cannot be as-
sessed with confidence. Impacts of large-scale and persistent
changes in the MOC are likely to include changes in marine
ecosystem productivity, fisheries, ocean CO, uptake, oceanic
oxygen concentrations and terrestrial vegetation. Changes in

The ranges for global economic potentials as assessed in each sector are shown by vertical lines. The ranges are based on end-use allocations of
emissions, meaning that emissions of electricity use are counted towards the end-use sectors and not to the energy supply sector.

The estimated potentials have been constrained by the availability of studies particularly at high carbon price levels.

Sectors used different baselines. For industry, the SRES B2 baseline was taken, for energy supply and transport, the World Energy Outlook
(WEO) 2004 baseline was used; the building sector is based on a baseline in between SRES B2 and A1B; for waste, SRES A1B driving
forces were used to construct a waste-specific baseline; agriculture and forestry used baselines that mostly used B2 driving forces.

Only global totals for transport are shown because international aviation is included.

Categories excluded are: non-CO, emissions in buildings and transport, part of material efficiency options, heat production and co-genera-
tion in energy supply, heavy duty vehicles, shipping and high-occupancy passenger transport, most high-cost options for buildings, wastewa-
ter treatment, emission reduction from coal mines and gas pipelines, and fluorinated gases from energy supply and transport. The underes-
timation of the total economic potential from these emissions is of the order of 10 to 15%.

"7 Studies on mitigation portfolios and macro-economic costs assessed in this report are based on top-down modelling. Most models use a
global least-cost approach to mitigation portfolios, with universal emissions trading, assuming transparent markets, no transaction cost, and
thus perfect implementation of mitigation measures throughout the 21‘ century. Costs are given for a specific point in time. Global modelled
costs will increase if some regions, sectors (e.g. land use), options or gases are excluded. Global modelled costs will decrease with lower
baselines, use of revenues from carbon taxes and auctioned permits, and if induced technological learning is included. These models do not consider
climate benefits and generally also co-benefits of mitigation measures, or equity issues. Significant progress has been achieved in applying ap-
proaches based on induced technological change to stabilisation studies; however, conceptual issues remain. In the models that consider induced
technological change, projected costs for a given stabilisation level are reduced; the reductions are greater at lower stabilisation level.

"The five ‘reasons for concern’ identified in the TAR re-
main a viable framework to consider key vulnerabili-
ties. These ‘reasons’ are assessed here to be stronger
than in the TAR. Many risks are identified with higher con-
fidence. Some risks are projected to be larger or to occur
at lower increases in temperature. Understanding about
the relationship between impacts (the basis for ‘reasons
for concern’ in the TAR) and vulnerability (that includes
the ability to adapt to impacts) has improved. {5.2}

"Adaptation is necessary in the short and longer term to ad-
dress impacts resulting from the warming that would occur even
for the lowest stabilisation scenarios assessed. There are barriers,
limits and costs, but these are not fully understood. Unmitigated
climate change would, in the long term, be likely to exceed the
capacity of natural, managed and human systems to adapt. The
time at which such limits could be reached will vary between
sectors and regions. Early mitigation actions would avoid further
locking in carbon intensive infrastructure and reduce climate
change and associated adaptation needs. /5.2, 5.3}

"e Aggregate impacts. Compared to the TAR, initial net mar-
ket-based benefits from climate change are projected to
peak at a lower magnitude of warming, while damages
would be higher for larger magnitudes of warming. The
net costs of impacts of increased warming are projected
to increase over time. {5.2}

e Risks of large-scale singularities. There is high confi-
dence that global warming over many centuries would lead
to a sea level rise contribution from thermal expansion
alone that is projected to be much larger than observed
over the 20"" century, with loss of coastal area and associ-
ated impacts. There is better understanding than in the TAR
that the risk of additional contributions to sea level rise
from both the Greenland and possibly Antarctic ice sheets
may be larger than projected by ice sheet models and could
occur on century time scales. This is because ice dynami-
cal processes seen in recent observations but not fully in-
cluded in ice sheet models assessed in the AR4 could in-
crease the rate of ice loss. {5.2}
"	List
"e Risks to unique and threatened systems. There is new
and stronger evidence of observed impacts of climate
change on unique and vulnerable systems (such as polar
and high mountain communities and ecosystems), with
increasing levels of adverse impacts as temperatures in-
crease further. An increasing risk of species extinction and
coral reef damage is projected with higher confidence than
in the TAR as warming proceeds. There is medium confi-
dence that approximately 20 to 30% of plant and animal
species assessed so far are likely to be at increased risk of
extinction if increases in global average temperature ex-
ceed 1.5 to 2.5°C over 1980-1999 levels. Confidence has
increased that a | to 2°C increase in global mean tem-
perature above 1990 levels (about 1.5 to 2.5°C above pre-
industrial) poses significant risks to many unique and
threatened systems including many biodiversity hotspots.
Corals are vulnerable to thermal stress and have low adap-
tive capacity. Increases in sea surface temperature of about
1 to 3°C are projected to result in more frequent coral
bleaching events and widespread mortality, unless there
is thermal adaptation or acclimatisation by corals. Increasing
vulnerability of indigenous communities in the Arctic and
small island communities to warming is projected. {5.2}

e Risks of extreme weather events. Responses to some re-
cent extreme events reveal higher levels of vulnerability
than the TAR. There is now higher confidence in the pro-
jected increases in droughts, heat waves and floods, as
well as their adverse impacts. {5.2}

e Distribution of impacts and vulnerabilities. There are
sharp differences across regions and those in the weakest
economic position are often the most vulnerable to cli-
mate change. There is increasing evidence of greater vul-
nerability of specific groups such as the poor and elderly
not only in developing but also in developed countries.
Moreover, there is increased evidence that low-latitude
and less developed areas generally face greater risk, for
example in dry areas and megadeltas. {5.2}

"All assessed stabilisation scenarios indicate that 60 to 80%
of the reductions would come from energy supply and use
and industrial processes, with energy efficiency playing a key
role in many scenarios. Including non-CO, and CO, land-use

cost-effectiveness. Low stabilisation levels require early invest-

commercialisation of advanced low-emissions technologies. {5.5}

"Sea level rise under warming is inevitable. Thermal ex-
pansion would continue for many centuries after GHG con-
centrations have stabilised, for any of the stabilisation levels
assessed, causing an eventual sea level rise much larger than
projected for the 21“ century. The eventual contributions from
Greenland ice sheet loss could be several metres, and larger
than from thermal expansion, should warming in excess of
1.9 to 4.6°C above pre-industrial be sustained over many cen-
turies. The long time scales of thermal expansion and ice sheet
response to warming imply that stabilisation of GHG concen-
trations at or above present levels would not stabilise sea level
for many centuries. /5.3, 5.4}
"	Text
"Notes:

a) The emission reductions to meet a particular stabilisation level reported in the mitigation studies assessed here might be underesti-
mated due to missing carbon cycle feedbacks (see also Topic 2.3).

b) Atmospheric CO, concentrations were 379ppm in 2005. The best estimate of total CO,-eq concentration in 2005 for all long-lived
GHGs is about 455ppm, while the corresponding value including the net effect of all anthropogenic forcing agents is 375ppm CO,-eq.

c) Ranges correspond to the 15"" to 85"" percentile of the post-TAR scenario distribution. CO, emissions are shown so multi-gas scenarios
can be compared with CO,-only scenarios (see Figure SPM.3).

d) The best estimate of climate sensitivity is 3°C.

e) Note that global average temperature at equilibrium is different from expected global average temperature at the time of stabilisation of
GHG concentrations due to the inertia of the climate system. For the majority of scenarios assessed, stabilisation of GHG concentra-
tions occurs between 2100 and 2150 (see also Footnote 21).

f) Equilibrium sea level rise is for the contribution from ocean thermal expansion only and does not reach equilibrium for at least many
centuries. These values have been estimated using relatively simple climate models (one low-resolution AOGCM and several EMICs
based on the best estimate of 3°C climate sensitivity) and do not include contributions from melting ice sheets, glaciers and ice caps.
Long-term thermal expansion is projected to result in 0.2 to 0.6m per degree Celsius of global average warming above pre-industrial.
(AOGCM refers to Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Model and EMICs to Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity.)

The IPCC uncertainty guidance note’ defines a framework for the treatment of uncertainties across all WGs and in this Synthesis Report.
This framework is broad because the WGs assess material from different disciplines and cover a diversity of approaches to the treatment of
uncertainty drawn from the literature. The nature of data, indicators and analyses used in the natural sciences is generally different from that
used in assessing technology development or the social sciences. WG | focuses on the former, WG Ill on the latter, and WG II covers aspects

"Climate change in IPCC usage refers to a change in the state
of the climate that can be identified (e.g. using statistical tests)
by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties,
and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or
longer. It refers to any change in climate over time, whether
due to natural variability or as a result of human activity. This
usage differs from that in the United Nations Framework Con-
vention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), where climate change
tefers to a change of climate that is attributed directly or indi-
rectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global
atmosphere and that is in addition to natural climate variability
observed over comparable time periods.

* CO,-equivalent emission is the amount of CO, emission
that would cause the same time-integrated radiative forcing,
over a given time horizon, as an emitted amount of a long-
lived GHG or a mixture of GHGs. The equivalent CO, emis-
sion is obtained by multiplying the emission of a GHG by its
Global Warming Potential (GWP) for the given time horizon.®
For a mix of GHGs it is obtained by summing the equivalent
CO, emissions of each gas. Equivalent CO, emission is a
standard and useful metric for comparing emissions of dif-
ferent GHGs but does not imply the same climate change
responses (see WGI 2.10).

* CO,-equivalent concentration is the concentration of CO,
that would cause the same amount of radiative forcing as a
given mixture of CO, and other forcing components.’

"Feedbacks can amplify or dampen the response to a given forc-

vapour concentrations increase and this represents a key positive
feedback but not a forcing of climate change. Water vapour changes
represent the largest feedback affecting equilibrium climate sensi-
tivity and are now better understood than in the TAR. Cloud feed-
backs remain the largest source of uncertainty. Spatial patterns of
climate response are largely controlled by climate processes and
feedbacks. For example, sea-ice albedo feedbacks tend to enhance
the high latitude response. {WGI 2.8, 8.6, 9.2, TS.2.1.3, TS.2.5, SPM}

SRES refers to the scenarios described in the IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES, 2000). The SRES scenarios are
grouped into four scenario families (A1, A2, B1 and B2) that explore alternative development pathways, covering a wide range of
demographic, economic and technological driving forces and resulting GHG emissions. The SRES scenarios do not include additional
climate policies above current ones. The emissions projections are widely used in the assessments of future climate change, and their
underlying assumptions with respect to socio-economic, demographic and technological change serve as inputs to many recent climate
change vulnerability and impact assessments. {WGI 10.1; WGII 2.4; WGIII TS.1, SPM}

fossil intensive (A1Fl), non-fossil energy resources (A1T) and a balance across all sources (A1B). B1 describes a convergent world,
with the same global population as A1, but with more rapid changes in economic structures toward a service and information economy.
B2 describes a world with intermediate population and economic growth, emphasising local solutions to economic, social, and environ-
mental sustainability. A2 describes a very heterogeneous world with high population growth, slow economic development and slow
technological change. No likelihood has been attached to any of the SRES scenarios. {WGiII TS.1, SPM}

nor provide a best estimate or an upper bound for sea level rise.
Model-based projections of global average sea level rise at the end
of the 21* century (2090-2099) are shown in Table 3.1. For each
scenario, the mid-point of the range in Table 3.1 is within 10% of
the TAR model average for 2090-2099. The ranges are narrower
than in the TAR mainly because of improved information about
some uncertainties in the projected contributions.'? The sea level
projections do not include uncertainties in climate-carbon cycle
feedbacks nor do they include the full effects of changes in ice
sheet flow, because a basis in published literature is lacking. There-
fore the upper values of the ranges given are not to be considered
upper bounds for sea level rise. The projections include a contribu-
tion due to increased ice flow from Greenland and Antarctica at the
rates observed for 1993-2003, but these flow rates could increase
or decrease in the future. If this contribution were to grow linearly

"Contraction of the Greenland ice sheet is projected to continue
to contribute to sea level rise after 2100. Current models suggest
ice mass losses increase with temperature more rapidly than gains
due to increased precipitation and that the surface mass balance
becomes negative (net ice loss) at a global average warming (rela-
tive to pre-industrial values) in excess of 1.9 to 4.6°C. If such a
negative surface mass balance were sustained for millennia, that
would lead to virtually complete elimination of the Greenland ice
sheet and a resulting contribution to sea level rise of about 7m. The
corresponding future temperatures in Greenland (1.9 to 4.6°C glo-

Changes in precipitation (Figure 3.3) and temperature (Figure 3.2) lead to changes in runoff (Figure 3.5) and water availability.
Runoff is projected with high confidence to increase by 10 to 40% by mid-century at higher latitudes and in some wet tropical areas,
including populous areas in East and South-East Asia, and decrease by 10 to 30% over some dry regions at mid-latitudes and dry
tropics, due to decreases in rainfall and higher rates of evapotranspiration. There is also high confidence that many semi-arid areas
(e.g. the Mediterranean Basin, western United States, southern Africa and north-eastern Brazil) will suffer a decrease in water re-
sources due to climate change. Drought-affected areas are projected to increase in extent, with the potential for adverse impacts on

"Recent studies reaffirm the TAR finding that adaptation will be
vital and beneficial. However, financial, technological, cognitive,
behavioural, political, social, institutional and cultural constraints limit
both the implementation and effectiveness of adaptation measures.
Even societies with high adaptive capacity remain vulnerable to cli-

2003 caused high levels of mortality in European cities (especially

"Societies across the world have a long record of adapting and
reducing their vulnerability to the impacts of weather- and climate-
related events such as floods, droughts and storms. Nevertheless,
additional adaptation measures will be required at regional and lo-
cal levels to reduce the adverse impacts of projected climate change
and variability, regardless of the scale of mitigation undertaken over
the next two to three decades. However, adaptation alone is not
expected to cope with all the projected effects of climate change,
especially not over the long term as most impacts increase in mag-
nitude. {WGII 17.2, SPM; WGIII 1.2}

"Comprehensive estimates of the costs and benefits of adapta-
tion at the global level are limited in number. However, the number
of adaptation cost and benefit estimates at the regional and project
levels for impacts on specific sectors, such as agriculture, energy
demand for heating and cooling, water resources management and
infrastructure, is growing. Based on these studies there is high con-
fidence that there are viable adaptation options that can be imple-
mented in some of these sectors at low cost and/or with high ben-
efit-cost ratios. Empirical research also suggests that higher ben-
efit-cost ratios can be achieved by implementing some adaptation
measures at an early stage compared to retrofitting long-lived in-
frastructure at a later date. {WGII 17.2}

21 The concept of ‘mitigation potential’ has been developed to assess the scale of GHG reductions that could be made, relative to emission baselines, for
a given level of carbon price (expressed in cost per unit of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions avoided or reduced). Mitigation potential is further differen-
tiated in terms of ‘market mitigation potential’ and ‘economic mitigation potential’.

Bottom-up studies suggest that mitigation opportunities with net

GtCO,-eq/yr in 2030. Realising these requires dealing with imple-
mentation barriers. The economic mitigation potential, which is
generally greater than the market mitigation potential, can only be
achieved when adequate policies are in place and barriers removed.”!

"Future energy infrastructure investment decisions, expected to

term impacts on GHG emissions, because of the long lifetimes of
energy plants and other infrastructure capital stock. The widespread
diffusion of low-carbon technologies may take many decades, even
if early investments in these technologies are made attractive. Ini-
tial estimates show that returning global energy-related CO, emis-

"and companies ), which might be expected to occur under forecast market conditions, including policies and measures currently in place, noting that
barriers limit actual uptake.

Economic mitigation potential is the mitigation potential that takes into account social costs and benefits and social discount rates (reflecting the
perspective of society; social discount rates are lower than those used by private investors ), assuming that market efficiency is improved by policies and
measures and barriers are removed.

Mitigation potential is estimated using different types of approaches. Bottom-up studies are based on assessment of mitigation options, emphasising
specific technologies and regulations. They are typically sectoral studies taking the macro-economy as unchanged. Top-down studies assess the
economy-wide potential of mitigation options. They use globally consistent frameworks and aggregated information about mitigation options and capture
macro-economic and market feedbacks.

Notes:

a) The ranges for global economic potentials as assessed in each sector are shown by vertical lines. The ranges are based on end-use allocations of
emissions, meaning that emissions of electricity use are counted towards the end-use sectors and not to the energy supply sector.

b) The estimated potentials have been constrained by the availability of studies particularly at high carbon price levels.

c) Sectors used different baselines. For industry the SRES B2 baseline was taken, for energy supply and transport the World Energy Outlook (WEO) 2004
baseline was used; the building sector is based on a baseline in between SRES B2 and A1B; for waste, SRES A1B driving forces were used to construct
a waste-specific baseline; agriculture and forestry used baselines that mostly used B2 driving forces.

d) Only global totals for transport are shown because international aviation is included.

e) Categories excluded are non-CO, emissions in buildings and transport, part of material efficiency options, heat production and cogeneration in energy
supply, heavy duty vehicles, shipping and high-occupancy passenger transport, most high-cost options for buildings, wastewater treatment, emission
reduction from coal mines and gas pipelines, and fluorinated gases from energy supply and transport. The underestimation of the total economic potential
from these emissions is of the order of 10 to 15%.

24 Studies on mitigation portfolios and macro-economic costs assessed in this report are based on top-down modelling. Most models use a global least-cost
approach to mitigation portfolios, with universal emissions trading, assuming transparent markets, no transaction cost, and thus perfect implementation of
mitigation measures throughout the 21* century. Costs are given for a specific point in time. Global modelled costs will increase if some regions, sectors (e.g.
land use), options or gases are excluded. Global modelled costs will decrease with lower baselines, use of revenues from carbon taxes and auctioned
permits, and if induced technological learning is included. These models do not consider climate benefits and generally also co-benefits of mitigation
measures, or equity issues. Significant progress has been achieved in applying approaches based on induced technological change to stabilisation studies;
however, conceptual issues remain. In the models that consider induced technological change, projected costs for a given stabilisation level are reduced; the
reductions are greater at lower stabilisation level.
"	Text
"Integrating climate policies in broader development policies
makes implementation and overcoming barriers easier.
Regulations and standards generally provide some certainty
about emission levels. They may be preferable to other instru-
ments when information or other barriers prevent producers and
consumers from responding to price signals. However, they may
not induce innovations and more advanced technologies.
Taxes and charges can set a price for carbon, but cannot guar-
antee a particular level of emissions. Literature identifies taxes
as an efficient way of internalising costs of GHG emissions.
Tradable permits will establish a carbon price. The volume of
allowed emissions determines their environmental effectiveness,
while the allocation of permits has distributional consequences.
Fluctuation in the price of carbon makes it difficult to estimate
the total cost of complying with emission permits.

Financial incentives (subsidies and tax credits) are frequently
used by governments to stimulate the development and diffu-
sion of new technologies. While economic costs are generally
higher than for the instruments listed above, they are often criti-
cal to overcome barriers.

Voluntary agreements between industry and governments are
politically attractive, raise awareness among stakeholders and
have played a role in the evolution of many national policies.
The majority of agreements have not achieved significant emis-
sions reductions beyond business as usual. However, some re-
cent agreements, in a few countries, have accelerated the appli-
cation of best available technology and led to measurable emis-
sion reductions.

Information instruments (e.g. awareness campaigns) may posi-
tively affect environmental quality by promoting informed
choices and possibly contributing to behavioural change, how-
ever, their impact on emissions has not been measured yet.

Risks to unique and threatened systems. There is new and
stronger evidence of observed impacts of climate change on
unique and vulnerable systems (such as polar and high moun-

adverse impacts as temperatures increase further. An increas-
ing risk of species extinction and coral reef damage is projected
with higher confidence than in the TAR as warming proceeds.
There is medium confidence that approximately 20 to 30% of

ecosystems (e.g. loss of Arctic sea ice and marine ecosystem vi-

in water storage and supply, or adaptation to sea level rise of sev-
eral metres”’. It will be less feasible or very costly in many cases for
the projected climate change beyond the next several decades (such
as deltaic regions and estuaries). There is high confidence that the
ability of many ecosystems to adapt naturally will be exceeded this
century. In addition, multiple barriers and constraints to effective

Risks of large-scale singularities.** As discussed in Topic 3.4,
during the current century, a large-scale abrupt change in the
meridional overturning circulation is very unlikely. There is high
confidence that global warming over many centuries would lead
to a sea level rise contribution from thermal expansion alone
that is projected to be much larger than observed over the 20""
century, with loss of coastal area and associated impacts. There
is better understanding than in the TAR that the risk of addi-
tional contributions to sea level rise from both the Greenland
and possibly Antarctic ice sheets may be larger than projected
by ice sheet models and could occur on century time scales.
This is because ice dynamical processes seen in recent obser-
vations but not fully included in ice sheet models assessed in
the AR4 could increase the rate of ice loss. Complete
deglaciation of the Greenland ice sheet would raise sea level
by 7m and could be irreversible. {SYR 3.4; WGI 10.3, Box 10.1;

trial) poses significant risks to many unique and threatened sys-
tems including many biodiversity hotspots. Corals are vulner-
able to thermal stress and have low adaptive capacity. Increases
in sea surface temperature of about | to 3°C are projected to
result in more frequent coral bleaching events and widespread
mortality, unless there is thermal adaptation or acclimatisation
by corals. Increasing vulnerability of Arctic indigenous com-
munities and small island communities to warming is projected.

e Risks of extreme weather events. Responses to some recent
extreme climate events reveal higher levels of vulnerability in
both developing and developed countries than was assessed in
the TAR. There is now higher confidence in the projected in-
creases in droughts, heat waves and floods, as well as their ad-
verse impacts. As summarised in Table 3.2, increases in drought,
heat waves and floods are projected in many regions and would
have mostly adverse impacts, including increased water stress
and wild fire frequency, adverse effects on food production,
adverse health effects, increased flood risk and extreme high
sea level, and damage to infrastructure. /SYR 3.2, 3.3, Table 3.2;

19.1, Table SPM.1}

e Distribution of impacts and vulnerabilities. There are sharp
differences across regions and those in the weakest economic
position are often the most vulnerable to climate change and
are frequently the most susceptible to climate-related damages,
especially when they face multiple stresses. There is increasing
evidence of greater vulnerability of specific groups such as the
poor and elderly not only in developing but also in developed
countries. There is greater confidence in the projected regional
patterns of climate change (see Topic 3.2) and in the projec-
tions of regional impacts, enabling better identification of par-
ticularly vulnerable systems, sectors and regions (see Topic 3.3).
Moreover, there is increased evidence that low-latitude and less-
developed areas generally face greater risk, for example in dry
areas and megadeltas. New studies confirm that Africa is one
of the most vulnerable continents because of the range of pro-
jected impacts, multiple stresses and low adaptive capacity.
Substantial risks due to sea level rise are projected particularly
for Asian megadeltas and for small island communities. /sYR

based benefits from climate change are projected to peak at a
lower magnitude and therefore sooner than was assessed in the
TAR. It is likely that there will be higher damages for larger
magnitudes of global temperature increase than estimated in

projected to increase over time. Aggregate impacts have also

The emission reductions to meet a particular stabilisation level reported in the mitigation studies assessed here might be underestimated due
missing carbon cycle feedbacks (see also Topic 2.3).

Atmospheric CO, concentrations were 379ppm in 2005. The best estimate of total CO,-eq concentration in 2005 for all long-lived GHGs is abc
455ppm, while the corresponding value including the net effect of all anthropogenic forcing agents is 375ppm CO,-eq.

Ranges correspond to the 15"" to 85"" percentile of the post-TAR scenario distribution. CO, emissions are shown so multi-gas scenarios can be
compared with CO,-only scenarios (see Figure 2.1).

The best estimate of climate sensitivity is 3°C.

Note that global average temperature at equilibrium is different from expected global average temperature at the time of stabilisation of GHG
concentrations due to the inertia of the climate system. For the majority of scenarios assessed, stabilisation of GHG concentrations occurs
between 2100 and 2150 (see also Footnote 30).

Equilibrium sea level rise is for the contribution from ocean thermal expansion only and does not reach equilibrium for at least many centuries
These values have been estimated using relatively simple climate models (one low-resolution AOGCM and several EMICs based on the best
estimate of 3°C climate sensitivity) and do not include contributions from melting ice sheets, glaciers and ice caps. Long-term thermal expans
is projected to result in 0.2 to 0.6m per degree Celsius of global average warming above pre-industrial. (AOGCM refers to Atmosphere-Ocean
General Circulation Model and EMICs to Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity.)

"Decisions about macro-economic and other policies that seem
unrelated to climate change can significantly affect emissions. {WGIII

"Some planned adaptation (of human activities) is occurring now;
more extensive adaptation is required to reduce vulnerability to cli-
mate change. {WGII 17.ES, 20.5, Table 20.6, SPM}
"	Text
"Unmitigated climate change would, in the long term, be likely
to exceed the capacity of natural, managed and human systems to
adapt. {WGII 20.7, SPM}
"	Text
"The evolution and utilisation of adaptive and mitigative capac-
ity depend on underlying socio-economic development pathways.
{WGI 17.3, 17.4, 18.6, 19.4, 20.9}
"	Text
"Understanding of low-probability/high-impact events and the
cumulative impacts of sequences of smaller events, which is re-
quired for risk-based approaches to decision-making, is generally
limited. {WGII 19.4, 20.2, 20.4, 20.9, TS.6}
"	Text
"Barriers, limits and costs of adaptation are not fully understood,
partly because effective adaptation measures are highly dependent
on specific geographical and climate risk factors as well as institu-
tional, political and financial constraints. {WGII SPM}
"	Text
"Projections of climate change and its impacts beyond about 2050
are strongly scenario- and model-dependent, and improved projections
would require improved understanding of sources of uncertainty and
enhancements in systematic observation networks. {WGII TS.6}
"	Text
"Large-scale ocean circulation changes beyond the 21* century
cannot be reliably assessed because of uncertainties in the meltwa-
ter supply from the Greenland ice sheet and model response to the
warming. {WGI 6.4, 8.7, 10.3 }

Making development more sustainable by changing develop-
ment paths can make a major contribution to climate change miti-
gation and adaptation and to reducing vulnerability. {WGI 18.7, 20.3,
SPM, WGIII 13.2, SPM}
"	Text
"Understanding of how development planners incorporate in-
formation about climate variability and change into their decisions
is limited. This limits the integrated assessment of vulnerability.
{WGII 18.8, 20.9}
"	Text
"Future changes in the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheet mass,
particularly due to changes in ice flow, are a major source of uncer-
tainty that could increase sea level rise projections. The uncertainty
in the penetration of the heat into the oceans also contributes to the
future sea level rise uncertainty. {WGI 4.6, 6.4, 10.3, 10.7, SPM}
"	Text
"Uncertainty in the equilibrium climate sensitivity creates un-
certainty in the expected warming for a given CO,-eq stabilisation
scenario. Uncertainty in the carbon cycle feedback creates uncer-
tainty in the emissions trajectory required to achieve a particular
stabilisation level. {WGI 7.3, 10.4, 10.5, SPM}
"	Text
"A wide range of mitigation options is currently available or pro-
jected to be available by 2030 in all sectors. The economic mitiga-
tion potential, at costs that range from net negative up to US$100/
tCO,-equivalent, is sufficient to offset the projected growth of glo-
bal emissions or to reduce emissions to below current levels in 2030.
{WGIII 11.3, SPM}
"	Text
"Many impacts can be reduced, delayed or avoided by mitiga-
tion. Mitigation efforts and investments over the next two to three
decades will have a large impact on opportunities to achieve lower
stabilisation levels. Delayed emissions reductions significantly con-
strain the opportunities to achieve lower stabilisation levels and
increase the risk of more severe climate change impacts. {WGII SPM,
WGIIT SPM}
"	Text
"Estimates of mitigation costs and potentials depend on assump-
tions about future socio-economic growth, technological change
and consumption patterns. Uncertainty arises in particular from
assumptions regarding the drivers of technology diffusion and the
potential of long-term technology performance and cost improve-
ments. Also little is known about the effects of changes in behaviour
and lifestyles. {WGIII 3.3, 3.4, 11.3}
"	Text
"Models differ considerably in their estimates of the strength of
different feedbacks in the climate system, particularly cloud feed-
backs, oceanic heat uptake and carbon cycle feedbacks, although
progress has been made in these areas. Also, the confidence in pro-
jections is higher for some variables (e.g. temperature) than for
others (e.g. precipitation), and it is higher for larger spatial scales
and longer time averaging periods. {WGI 7.3, 8.1-8.7, 9.6, 10.2, 10.7,
SPM; WGII 4.4}
"	Text
"The range of stabilisation levels for GHG concentrations that
have been assessed can be achieved by deployment of a portfolio
of technologies that are currently available and those that are ex-
pected to be commercialised in coming decades, provided that ap-
propriate and effective incentives are in place and barriers are re-
moved. In addition, further RD&D would be required to improve
the technical performance, reduce the costs and achieve social ac-
ceptability of new technologies. The lower the stabilisation levels,
the greater the need for investment in new technologies during the
next few decades. {WGIII 3.3, 3.4}

Users who wish to gain a better understanding of scientific details or access the primary scientific literature on which the SYR is based,
should refer to chapter sections of the underlying Working Group reports that are cited in the longer report of the SYR. The individual
chapters of the Working Group reports provide comprehensive references to the primary scientific literature on which IPCC assess-

Electromagnetic radiation may interact with matter, be it in the form of the
atoms and molecules of a gas (e.g. the gases in the atmosphere) or in the
form of particulate, solid or liquid, matter (e.g. aerosols), in various ways.
Matter itself emits radiation in accordance with its composition and tem-
perature. Radiation may be absorbed by matter, whereby the absorbed en-
ergy may be transferred or re-emitted. Finally, radiation may also be de-
flected from its original path (scattered) as a result of interaction with
matter.

The nonlinearity of the climate system may lead to abrupt climate change,
sometimes called rapid climate change, abrupt events or even surprises.
The term abrupt often refers to time scales faster than the typical time
scale of the responsible forcing. However, not all abrupt climate changes
need be externally forced. Some possible abrupt events that have been
proposed include a dramatic reorganisation of the thermohaline circula-
tion, rapid deglaciation and massive melting of permafrost or increases in
soil respiration leading to fast changes in the carbon cycle. Others may be
truly unexpected, resulting from a strong, rapidly changing, forcing of a
non-linear system.

The pilot phase for Joint Implementation, as defined in Article 4.2(a) of
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
that allows for project activity among developed countries (and their com-
panies) and between developed and developing countries (and their com-

Future climate change induced by atmospheric emissions of greenhouse
gases will impact on the global carbon cycle. Changes in the global car-
bon cycle in turn will influence the fraction of anthropogenic greenhouse
gases that remains in the atmosphere, and hence the atmospheric concen-
trations of greenhouse gases, resulting in further climate change. This feed-
back is called climate-carbon cycle coupling. The first generation coupled
climate-carbon cycle models indicates that global warming will increase
the fraction of anthropogenic CO, that remains in the atmosphere.

In IPCC reports, equilibrium climate sensitivity refers to the equilibrium
change in the annual mean global surface temperature following a dou-
bling of the atmospheric equivalent carbon dioxide concentration. Due to
computational constraints, the equilibrium climate sensitivity in a climate
model is usually estimated by running an atmospheric general circulation
model coupled to a mixed-layer ocean model, because equilibrium climate
sensitivity is largely determined by atmospheric processes. Efficient mod-

Climate change refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be
identified (e.g., by using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or
the variability of its properties, and that persists for an extended period,

processes or external forcings, or to persistent anthropogenic changes in
the composition of the atmosphere or in land use. Note that the United

to thousands or millions of years. The classical period for averaging these
variables is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organiza-

Defined in Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol, the CDM is intended to meet
two objectives: (1) to assist parties not included in Annex J in achieving
sustainable development and in contributing to the ultimate objective of
the convention; and (2) to assist parties included in Annex I in achieving
compliance with their quantified emission limitation and reduction com-
mitments. Certified Emission Reduction Units from CDM projects under-
taken in non-Annex I countries that limit or reduce greenhouse gas emis-
sions, when certified by operational entities designated by Conference of

the certified project activities is used to cover administrative expenses as
well as to assist developing country parties that are particularly vulnerable

A numerical representation of the climate system based on the physical,
chemical and biological properties of its components, their interactions
and feedback processes, and accounting for all or some of its known prop-
erties. The climate system can be represented by models of varying com-
plexity, that is, for any one component or combination of components a
spectrum or hierarchy of models can be identified, differing in such as-
pects as the number of spatial dimensions, the extent to which physical,
chemical or biological processes are explicitly represented, or the level at
which empirical parametrisations are involved. Coupled Atmosphere-Ocean
General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) provide a representation of the cli-
mate system that is near the most comprehensive end of the spectrum currently
available. There is an evolution towards more complex models with interac-
tive chemistry and biology (see WGI Chapter 8). Climate models are applied
as a research tool to study and simulate the climate, and for operational pur-
poses, including monthly, seasonal and interannual climate predictions.

The climate system is the highly complex system consisting of five major
components: the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, the cryosphere, the land
surface and the biosphere, and the interactions between them. The climate
system evolves in time under the influence of its own internal dynamics
and because of external forcings such as volcanic eruptions, solar varia-
tions and anthropogenic forcings such as the changing composition of the
atmosphere and land-use change.

administrative costs, damage costs (to ecosystems, people and economies

The difference between the total incoming and total outgoing energy in the
climate system. If this balance is positive, warming occurs; if it is nega-

this balance must be zero. Because the climate system derives virtually all
its energy from the Sun, zero balance implies that, globally, the amount of
incoming solar radiation on average must be equal to the sum of the out-

tion emitted by the climate system. A perturbation of this global radiation

In general terms, drought is a ‘prolonged absence or marked deficiency of
precipitation’, a ‘deficiency that results in water shortage for some activ-
ity or for some group’, or a ‘period of abnormally dry weather sufficiently
prolonged for the lack of precipitation to cause a serious hydrological im-
balance’ (Heim, 2002). Drought has been defined in a number of ways.
Agricultural drought relates to moisture deficits in the topmost | metre or
so of soil (the root zone) that affect crops, meteorological drought is mainly
a prolonged deficit of precipitation, and hydrologic drought is related to
below-normal streamflow, lake and groundwater levels. A megadrought is
a longdrawn out and pervasive drought, lasting much longer than normal,
usually a decade or more.

The term El Nifo was initially used to describe a warm-water current that
periodically flows along the coast of Ecuador and Pert, disrupting the
local fishery. It has since become identified with a basinwide warming of
the tropical Pacific east of the dateline. This oceanic event is associated
with a fluctuation of a global-scale tropical and subtropical surface pres-

is collectively known as El Nifio-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO. It is of-

The amount of work or heat delivered. Energy is classified in a variety of
types and becomes useful to human ends when it flows from one place to
another or is converted from one type into another. Primary energy (also
referred to as energy sources) is the energy embodied in natural resources
(e.g., coal, crude oil, natural gas, uranium) that has not undergone any
anthropogenic conversion. This primary energy needs to be converted and
transported to become usable energy (e.g. light). Renewable energy is
obtained from the continuing or repetitive currents of energy occurring in
the natural environment, and includes non-carbon technologies such as
solar energy, hydropower, wind, tide and waves, and geothermal heat, as
well as carbon neutral technologies such as biomass. Embodied energy is
the energy used to produce a material substance (such as processed metals,
or building materials), taking into account energy used at the manufactur-
ing facility (zero order), energy used in producing the materials that are
used in the manufacturing facility (first order), and so on.

Greenhouse gases are those gaseous constituents of the atmosphere, both
natural and anthropogenic, that absorb and emit radiation at specific wave-
lengths within the spectrum of thermal infrared radiation emitted by the
Earth’s surface, the atmosphere itself, and by clouds. This property causes
the greenhouse effect. Water vapour (H,O), carbon dioxide (CO,), nitrous
oxide (N,O), methane (CH,) and ozone (O,) are the primary greenhouse
gases in the Earth’s atmosphere. Moreover, there are a number of entirely
human-made greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as the halocar-
bons and other chlorine and bromine containing substances, dealt with
under the Montreal Protocol. Beside Co,, N,O and CH,, the Kyoto Proto-
col deals with the greenhouse gases sulphur hexafluoride (SF,),
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs).

"by clouds. Atmospheric radiation is emitted to all sides, including down-
ward to the Earth’s surface. Thus greenhouse gases trap heat within the
surface-troposphere system. This is called the greenhouse effect.Thermal
infrared radiation in the troposphere is strongly coupled to the temperature
of the atmosphere at the altitude at which it is emitted. In the troposphere,
the temperature generally decreases with height. Effectively, infrared ra-
diation emitted to space originates from an altitude with a temperature of,
on average, —19°C, in balance with the net incoming solar radiation,
whereas the Earth’s surface is kept at a much higher temperature of, on
average, +14°C. An increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases leads
to an increased infrared opacity of the atmosphere, and therefore to an
effective radiation into space from a higher altitude at a lower tempera-
ture. This causes a radiative forcing that leads to an enhancement of the
greenhouse effect, the so-called enhanced greenhouse effect.

The prevailing concept for water management which, however, has not
been defined unambiguously. IWRM is based on four principles that were
formulated by the International Conference on Water and the Environment
in Dublin, 1992: 1) fresh water is a finite and vulnerable resource, essen-
tial to sustain life, development and the environment; 2) water develop-
ment and management should be based on a participatory approach, in-
volving users, planners and policymakers at all levels; 3) women play a
central part in the provision, management and safeguarding of water; 4)
water has an economic value in all its competing uses and should be

Third Session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC. It
contains legally binding commitments, in addition to those included in the
UNFCCC. Countries included in Annex B of the Protocol (most Organiza-

with economies in transition) agreed to reduce their anthropogenic green-
house gas emissions (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide,
hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulphur hexafluoride) by at
least 5% below 1990 levels in the commitment period 2008 to 2012. The
Kyoto Protocol entered into force on 16 February 2005.

Natural variability of the climate system, in particular on seasonal and
longer time scales, predominantly occurs with preferred spatial patterns
and time scales, through the dynamical characteristics of the atmospheric
circulation and through interactions with the land and ocean surfaces. Such
patterns are often called regimes, modes or teleconnections. Examples are
the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Pacific-North American pattern
(PNA), the El Nifio- Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Northern Annular
Mode (NAM; previously called Arctic Oscillation, AO) and the Southern
Annular Mode (SAM; previously called the Antarctic Oscillation, AAO).
Many of the prominent modes of climate variability are discussed in sec-

as illustrative of a particular storyline. They are included in revised form

The concept of sustainable development was introduced in the World Con-
servation Strategy (IUCN 1980) and had its roots in the concept of a sus-
tainable society and in the management of renewable resources. Adopted
by the WCED in 1987 and by the Rio Conference in 1992 as a process of
change in which the exploitation of resources, the direction of investments,
the orientation of technological development, and institutional change are
all in harmony and enhance both current and future potential to meet hu-
man needs and aspirations. SD integrates the political, social, economic
and environmental dimensions.

A carbon tax is a levy on the carbon content of fossil fuels. Because virtu-
ally all of the carbon in fossil fuels is ultimately emitted as carbon diox-
ide, a carbon tax is equivalent to an emission tax on each unit of CO2-
equivalent emissions. An energy tax - a levy on the energy content of fuels
- reduces demand for energy and so reduces carbon dioxide emissions from
fossil fuel use. An eco-tax is designed to influence human behaviour (spe-
cifically economic behaviour) to follow an ecologically benign path. An
international carbon/emission/energy tax is a tax imposed on specified
sources in participating countries by an international agreement. A
harmonised tax commits participating countries to impose a tax at a com-
mon rate on the same sources. A tax credit is a reduction of tax in order to
stimulate purchasing of or investment in a certain product, like GHG emis-
sion reducing technologies. A carbon charge is the same as a carbon tax.

Radiation emitted by the Earth’s surface, the atmosphere and the clouds. It
is also known as terrestrial or longwave radiation, and is to be distin-
guished from the near-infrared radiation that is part of the solar spectrum.
Infrared radiation, in general, has a distinctive range of wavelengths (spec-
trum) longer than the wavelength of the red colour in the visible part of the
spectrum. The spectrum of thermal infrared radiation is practically dis-
tinct from that of shortwave or solar radiation because of the difference in
temperature between the Sun and the Earth-atmosphere system.

An expression of the degree to which a value (e.g., the future state of the
climate system) is unknown. Uncertainty can result from lack of informa-
tion or from disagreement about what is known or even knowable. It may
have many types of sources, from quantifiable errors in the data to am-
biguously defined concepts or terminology, or uncertain projections of
human behaviour. Uncertainty can therefore be represented by quantita-
tive measures, for example, a range of values calculated by various mod-
els, or by qualitative statements, for example, reflecting the judgement of
a team of experts (see Moss and Schneider, 2000; Manning et al., 2004).

The Convention was adopted on 9 May 1992 in New York and signed at
the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro by more than 150 countries and
the European Community. Its ultimate objective is the “stabilisation of
greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would pre-
vent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system”. It
contains commitments for all Parties. Under the Convention, Parties in-
cluded in Annex J (all OECD member countries in the year 1990 and coun-
tries with economies in transition) aim to return greenhouse gas emissions
not controlled by the Montreal Protocol to 1990 levels by the year 2000. The
Convention entered in force in March 1994. See Kyoto Protocol.

Mostly considered as technological improvement, i.e. more or better goods
and services can be provided from a given amount of resources (produc-
tion factors). Economic models distinguish autonomous (exogenous), en-
dogenous and induced technological change. Autonomous (exogenous) tech-
nological change is imposed from outside the model, usually in the form
of a time trend affecting energy demand or world output growth. Endog-
enous technological change is the outcome of economic activity within
the model, i.e. the choice of technologies is included within the model and
affects energy demand and/or economic growth. Induced technological
change implies endogenous technological change but adds further changes
induced by policies and measures, such as carbon taxes triggering R&D
efforts.

Vulnerability is the degree to which a system is susceptible to, and unable
to cope with, adverse effects of climate change, including climate vari-
ability and extremes. Vulnerability is a function of the character, magni-

A country is water stressed if the available freshwater supply relative to
water withdrawals acts as an important constraint on development. In glo-
bal-scale assessments, basins with water stress are often defined as having
a per capita water availability below 1,000 m*/yr (based on long-term av-
erage runoff). Withdrawals exceeding 20% of renewable water supply have
also been used as an indicator of water stress. A crop is water stressed if
soil available water, and thus actual evapotranspiration, is less than po-
tential evapotranspiration demands.

"he Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was set up jointly by the World Meteorological Organization and the

United Nations Environment Programme to provide an authoritative international statement of scientific understanding of
climate change. The IPCC’s periodic assessments of the causes, impacts and possible response strategies to climate change are
the most comprehensive and up-to-date reports available on the subject, and form the standard reference for all concerned with
climate change in academia, government and industry worldwide. This Synthesis Report is the fourth element of the IPCC Fourth
Assessment Report “Climate Change 2007”. Through three working groups, many hundreds of international experts assess
climate change in this Report. The three working group contributions are available from Cambridge University Press:
