itself to produce a Second Assessment Report in 1995,
covering the same range of topics as in 1990 as well as the

 

new subject area of technical issues related to the
economic aspects of climate change. The Panel was aware
that the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (CoP)

exceedingly pleased to note here the very special efforts
undertaken by the IPCC in ensuring the participation of
experts from the developing and transitional economy

worthwhile and timely capacity-building exercise. The
experts have given of their time very generously, and
governments have supported them, in the enormous

The IPCC Supplementary Report (1992) confirmed the
essential conclusions of the 1990 assessment concerning
our understanding of climate and the factors affecting it. It
reported progress in quantifying two factors other than
anthropogenic greenhouse gases which influence radiative
forcing: the depletion of ozone in the stratosphere (by
CFCs), and the effect of aerosols produced primarily by
industrial emissions but also by biomass burning and other
processes. Further research in atmospheric chemistry was
revealing a more complicated picture than was first
thought, and the updated values of GWP in the 1992 report

In its first Scientific Assessment of Climate Change in
1990 the IPCC concluded that the increase of greenhouse
gas concentrations due to human activities would result in
a warming of the Earth’s surface. “Radiative forcing” is
the name given to the effect which these gases have in
altering the energy balance of the Earth—atmosphere
system and, using this concept, the 1990 report introduced
a tool for policymakers, the Global Warming Potential,
which allowed the relative warming effect of different
gases to be compared. Other factors, natural and human,
also cause radiative forcing. The 1990 report not only
examined these factors but also reviewed a wide range of
information on how climate has behaved in the past and
how it might change in the future as a result of human
influence.

aerosol radiative forcing are highly uncertain,

globally-averaged radiative forcing are less certain than for
the well-mixed gases (because the patterns of change are
not well-quantified) and (ii) any negative forcing due to
aerosols cannot be regarded as a simple offset to the effect
of greenhouse gases (because the regional patterns of the
forcings are different). Nevertheless, we report such
estimates in order to provide a broad indication of their
relative magnitude.

 

* Limited observations and mode! simulations suggest
that tropospheric ozone in the Northern Hemisphere
has increased since pre-industrial times resulting in a
global average radiative forcing of 0.2 to 0.6 Wm.

* Halocarbon-induced depletion of ozone in the
stratosphere has resulted in a negative global average
radiative forcing of about -0.1 Wm”?. This has
occurred mainly since the late 1970s over which
period it has been of similar magnitude, but opposite
sign, to the forcing caused by the halocarbons. Prior
to the onset of significant ozone depletion the
radiative forcing due to the halocarbons was between
+0.1 and 0.2 Wm.

« Anthropogenic particles in the atmosphere, derived
from emissions of sulphur dioxide and from biomass

"If carbon dioxide emissions were maintained at
today’s levels, they would lead to a nearly constant
rate of increase in atmospheric concentrations for at
least two centuries, reaching about 500 ppmv

A stable level of carbon dioxide concentration at
values up to 750 ppmv can be maintained only with
anthropogenic emissions that eventually drop below
1990 levels.

To a first approximation the eventual stabilised
concentration is governed more by the accumulated
CO, emissions from now until the time of
stabilisation, and less by the exact path taken to
teach stabilisation. This means that, for example, for
a given stabilisation scenario, higher emissions in
early decades imply lower emissions later on, For the
range of arbitrary stabilisation cases studied,
accumulated emissions to the end of the 21st century
were between 300 and 430 GtC! for stabilisation at
350 ppmv, between 880 and 1060 GtC for
stabilisation at 550 ppmv, and between 1220 and

A change in average net radiation at the top of the

change in either solar or infrared radiation, is defined for
the purpose of this report as a radiative forcing. A
radiative forcing perturbs the balance between incoming
and outgoing radiation. Over time climate responds to the
perturbation to re-establish the radiative balance. A
positive radiative forcing tends on average to warm the

solar radiation absorbed by the Earth’s surface and

climate changes, if the forcing mechanisms have different
geographical distributions. This issue is beginning to be
addressed through the use of climate models and a more
detailed assessment can be expected in the 1995 IPCC
report. Because of these problems, we avoid summing the
various positive and negative contributions of the human-
induced global mean radiative forcing to produce a net
anthropogenic forcing.

"For example, an increase in atmospheric CO,
concentration leads to a reduction in outgoing infrared
radiation and a positive radiative forcing. For a doubling of
the pre-industrial CO, concentration, in the absence of any
other change, the global mean radiative forcing would be
about 4 Wm. For balance to be restored, the temperature
of the troposphere and of the surface must increase,
producing an increase in outgoing radiation. For a
doubling of CO, concentration, the increase in surface
temperature at equilibrium would be just over | °C, if other
factors (¢.g., clouds, tropospheric water vapour and
aerosols) are held constant. Taking internal feedbacks into
account, the 1990 IPCC report estimated that the increase
in global average surface temperature at equilibrium
resulting from a doubling of CO, would be likely to be
between 1.5 and 4.5 °C, with a best estimate of 2.5 °C.

At present concentrations of CO5, the relationship
between concentration change and radiative forcing is
strongly non-linear. For greenhouse gases with much
smaller atmospheric concentrations the relationship is
linear. This partly explains why changes in gases such

on radiative forcing, molecule for molecule, than does
CO,. The calculation of the radiative effects of CO,

not increase the greenhouse effect. Infrared absorption

photosynthesis of 20 to 40% when CO, is doubled.
However, attempting to quantify the effect on a global

water and nutrients is taken into account the fertilisation
effect is likely to be reduced; several model results suggest
reduction by around a half. The interaction of CO,
fertilisation with the nitrogen cycle also has to be

Carbon is exchanged between the atmosphere, the oceans, the terrestrial biosphere (Figure 4), and, on geological time-
scales, with sediments and sedimentary rocks. Fossil fuel burning, cement manufacture, and forest harvest and other
changes of land-use transfer carbon (as CO,) to the atmosphere. Although the anthropogenic flux of CO, is small
compared with mean natural fluxes (Figure 4), it is sufficient to perturb the carbon cycle. The additional anthropogenic
CO, cycles between the atmosphere, ocean, and marine and terrestrial biospheres. The net uptake of anthropogenic
CO,, particularly by the deep ocean, occurs slowly (for the oceans: on a time-scale of centuries), so addition of
anthropogenic CO, has a long-lasting effect on atmospheric concentration. For example, if CO, emissions were held
constant at present day levels, atmospheric concentrations would continue to rise for at least two centuries.

Methane is another naturally occurring greenhouse gas
whose concentration in the atmosphere is growing as a
result of human activities (rice paddies, animal husbandry,
landfills, biomass burning and fossil fuel production and
use) (Figure 9a). Globally, methane increased by 7% over
the decade from 1983. However, the 1980s were
characterised by declining growth rates, dropping from
16 ppbv/yr in 1980 to about 10 ppbv/yr by 1990. Growth
rates slowed dramatically in 1991 and 1992, although very
recent data suggest that growth rates started to increase in
late 1993 (see the box on “Variations in the growth rates of
CO, and CH, concentrations”). The magnitudes of sinks
and, especially, individual sources of methane, are less
well known than its atmospheric increase (Table 4).
However, carbon isotope measurements indicate that about
20% of the total annual methane emissions are related to
fossil fuel use (e.g., combustion, coal mines, natural gas
production and distribution, and petroleum industry
operations). In total, anthropogenic activities are
responsible for 60-80% of current methane emissions
(Table 4). The direct radiative forcing duc to the increase
in methane concentration since pre-industrial times is
about 0.5 Wm (Figure 3).

been observed in the mid-latitudes of both hemispheres. In
the Northern Hemisphere the trends in the 1980s are larger
in local winter and spring than in summer or autumn, while
in the Southern Hemisphere the trends show little seasonal

the ozone losses amount to about a 10% decrease since

Such emissions could increase ozone concentration at

NO, emissions at the surface. Until the various
contributions to NO, and O, levels in the free troposphere

reliably estimated. However, reasonable upper limits may
be placed on the radiative forcing due to increased O,

from fossil fuel combustion and a similar fraction of

Our identification of the major physical and chemical
processes affecting ozone in the troposphere is much
further advanced than our ability to calculate or predict
ozone concentrations. Uncertainties in the global budget of
tropospheric ozone are associated primarily with our lack
of knowledge of the distribution of O, and its short-lived
precursors (NO,, NMHC and CO). Observations of NO,
are just beginning to reveal the atmospheric distribution
and large variability in these ozone-producing species, but
even with the observed distributions we cannot define the
importance of anthropogenic sources (e.g., transport of
surface pollution out of the boundary layer, direct injection
by aircraft) relative to natural sources (lightning,
stratospheric air) in controlling the global NO,
distribution. Current estimates of anthropogenic NO,
sources attribute 24 Tg(N)/yr to fossil fuel combustion at
the surface, 0.5 Tg(N)yr to aircraft emissions, 8 Te(N)/yr
to biomass burning and an unknown, but significant
fraction of the 12 Tg(N)/yr released from soils.

"In the troposphere ozone is produced from various short-
lived precursor gases (carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen
oxides (NO,) and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC))
and as a result of chemical feedbacks involving CHy.
Ozone can also be transported into the troposphere from
the stratosphere. Changes in tropospheric ozone
concentration are highly spatially variable, both regionally
and vertically, making assessment of global long-term
trends extremely difficult. Observations show that free
tropospheric ozone has increased above many locations in
the Northern Hemisphere over the last 30 years. There is
also some evidence (from measurements made at high
mountain sites in Europe) that levels have increased in the
Northern Hemisphere since the early 1900s. Over the last
decade, trends were small or non-existent. Model
simulations and the limited observations together suggest
that tropospheric ozone may have doubled in the Northern
Hemisphere since pre-industrial times, an increase of
around 25 ppbv. In the Southern Hemisphere, a decrease
has been observed since the mid-1980s at the South Pole;
in the hemisphere as a whole there are insufficient data to

Figure 12 shows the spatial distribution of direct
radiative forcing due to sulphate aerosols derived from a
radiative transfer model forced with a model derived
sulphate distribution. The largest forcing occurs over or
close to regions of industrial activity. Over the eastern
USA, central Europe, and eastern China, sulphate forcing
may have offset much of, or in places been greater than,
the greenhouse gas forcing. In other areas, particularly the
Southern Hemisphere, the negative aerosol forcing is much
weaker and greenhouse gas forcing dominates. However,
care must be taken when comparing regional radiative
forcing in this way. For example, a local net forcing of
zero Wm does not necessarily imply a lack of climate
change, because climate change over a region can be
affected by changes in circulation as the atmosphere
responds to radiative forcing in another region (i.c., local
forcing does not necessarily govern local response).

New estimates of both the direct and indirect effect of
anthropogenic aerosols in the troposphere have become
available since IPCC 1992. In order to compare different
aerosol effects it is useful to express them in terms of
globally averaged values of radiative forcing. The direct
radiative forcing due to increases in sulphate aerosol since
1850, averaged globally, is estimated to lie in the range
-0.25 to -0.9 Wm. The direct effect of aerosol from
biomass burning is estimated to lie in the range -0.05 to
-0.6 Wm. Calculations of the indirect effect of aerosols
are at an early stage. Preliminary results suggest that the
radiative effect of aerosols on cloud radiative properties is
probably a negative forcing and may be of similar
magnitude to the direct effect. Note that in the global
average the total aerosol induced radiative forcing is
negative, but the absorption of solar radiation by
carbonaceous aerosols may cause local positive radiative
forcing. It is interesting to compare these estimates with
the direct radiative forcing due to increases in greenhouse
gases since pre-industrial times (+2.1 to +2.8 Wm’) (see
Figure 3), although, as pointed out in Section 1, it is
unlikely to be appropriate to add the negative global

increases are largely due to (i) an improved carbon dioxide
reference and (ii) improved estimates of atmospheric
lifetimes. Because GWPs are based on the radiative

Policymakers need some measure of possible future

provide such a measure. The index is defined as the
cumulative radiative forcing between the present and some

emitted now, expressed relative to some reference gas
(here CO, is used). The future global warming
commitment of a greenhouse gas over the reference time
horizon is the appropriate GWP multiplied by the amount
of gas emitted. For example, GWPs could be used to
calculate the effect of reducing CO, emissions by a certain
amount compared with reducing CH, emissions, for a

We know that total solar irradiance varies with an 11-year
cycle. Space-borne satellite measurements available since
1978 show that over the most recent sunspot cycle the
changes in solar irradiance were equivalent to a radiative
forcing of about 0.2 Wm”. This may initially seem
significant, given that it is an appreciable fraction of the
forcing due to greenhouse gases over the same period.
However, these changes in solar irradiance are cyclical in
nature and it is believed that, due to the thermal inertia in
the climate system, only a small amount of the possible
temperature change resulting from such transient changes
in irradiance is realised. In contrast, the changes in
greenhouse gases represent a sustained and cumulative
effect over many decades.

The eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines in June
1991 stands out from a climatic point of view as probably
the most important eruption this century. The largest
forcing is calculated to have been about -4 Wm around
one year after the eruption. This decayed to around -1 Wm?
after 2 years. Thus, the radiative forcing resulting from Mt.
Pinatubo for the first 2 years after the eruption was
comparable, but of opposite sign, to the greenhouse gas
forcing this century (+2.1 to +2.8 Wm”). A cooling of
global surface temperature observed following the eruption
reached a maximum of 0.3 to 0.5 °C during 1992.
Simulation of the climatic effects of Mt. Pinatubo aerosols

Atmospheric levels of CO, have been measured directly
since 1957. The concentration and isotope records prior to
that time consist of evidence from ice cores, moss cores,
packrat middens, tree rings, and the isotopic measurements
of planktonic and benthic foraminifera. Ice cores serve as
the primary data source because they provide a fairly direct
and continuous record of past atmospheric composition.
The ice cores indicate that an increase in CO, level of
about 80 ppmv paralleled the last interglacial warming.
There is uncertainty over whether changes in CO, levels as
rapid as those of the 20th century have occurred in the
past. However, there is essentially no uncertainty that for
approximately the last 18,000 years, CO, concentrations in
the atmosphere have fluctuated around 280 ppmy, and that
the recent increase to a concentration of ~356 ppmvy, with a
current rate of increase of ~1.5 ppmv/yr, is due to
combustion of fossil fuel, cement production, and land use
conversion.

Averaged over the 1980s, terrestrial exchanges include a
tropical source of 1.6 + 1.0 GtC/yr from ongoing changes
in land use, based on land clearing rates, biomass
inventories, and modelled forest regrowth. Recent satellite
data have reduced uncertainties in the rate of deforestation
for the Amazon, but rates for the rest of the tropics remain
poorly quantified. For the tropics as a whole, there is
incomplete information on initial biomass and rates of
regrowth. Potential terrestrial sinks may be the result of
several processes, including the regrowth of mid-latitude
and high latitude Northern Hemisphere forests (0.5 + 0.5
GiC/yr), enhanced forest growth due to CO, fertilisation
(0.5-2.0 GtC/yr) and nitrogen deposition (0.2-1.0 GtC/yr),
and, possibly, response to climatic anomalies (0-1.0
GtC/yr). Partitioning the sink among these processes is
difficult, but it is likely that all components are involved.
While the CO, fertilisation cffect is the most commonly
cited terrestrial uptake mechanism, existing model studies
indicate that the magnitude of contributions from each
process are comparable, within large ranges of uncertainty.
For example, some model-based evidence suggests that the
magnitude of the CO, fertilisation effect is limited by
interactions with nutrients and other ecological processes.
Experimental confirmation from ecosystem-level studies,
however, is lacking. As a result, the role of the terrestrial
biosphere in controlling future atmospheric CO,

emissions must eventually decline relative to today’s

"1.1 Description of the Carbon Cycle

"Atmospheric CO, provides a link between biological,
physical, and anthropogenic processes. Carbon is exchanged
between the atmosphere, the oceans, the terrestrial
biosphere, and, more slowly, with sediments and
sedimentary rocks. The faster components of the cycle are
shown in Figure 1.1. In the absence of anthropogenic CO,
inputs, the carbon cycle had periods of millennia in which
large carbon exchanges were in near balance, implying
nearly constant reservoir contents. Human activities have
disturbed this balance through the use of fossil carbon and
disruption of terrestrial ecosystems. The consequent
accumulation of CO, in the atmosphere has caused a
number of carbon cycle exchanges to become unbalanced.

transfer carbon (mainly as CO,) to the atmosphere. This
anthropogenic carbon then cycles between the atmosphere,

slowly, on time-scales of decades to millennia, the
effect of additional fossil and biomass carbon injected into
the atmosphere is a long-lasting disturbance of the carbon
cycle. The relationships between concentration changes
and emissions of CO, are examined through use of models

component cycles are simplified and subject to considerable uncertainty. In addition, this figure presents average values. The riverine
flux, particularly the anthropogenic portion, is currently very poorly quantified and so is not shown here (sec text). While the surface

Evidence is accumulating that many of the key fluxes can fluctuate significantly from year to year (terrestrial sinks and sources: INPE,
1992; Ciais ct al., submitted; export from the marine biota: Wong ct al., 1993). In contrast to the static view conveyed by figures such

The early 1980s were characterised by a period of relatively constant or slightly declining fossil carbon
emissions. After 1985, emissions again exceeded the 1979 level; each year’s release during the latter half of
the 1980s was 0.1 to 0.2 GtC above that for the previous year (Boden et al., 1991).

Direct measurements and ice core data have revealed a general decrease in atmospheric levels of !3C relative
to !°C by about 1%o over the last century (Friedli e¢ al., 1986; Keeling et al., 1989a; Leuenberger et al., 1992).
This decrease is expected from the addition of fossil and/or terrestrial biospheric carbon, both of which are
poor in '3C relative to the atmosphere. In contrast, the atmospheric !C/!?C ratio remained nearly constant
from 1988 to 1993. This constant ratio must reflect changes in the fluxes between the ocean, terrestrial
biosphere, and atmosphere which currently are not quantified. The atmospheric record of !3C shows a
decrease of ~0.4%e between the first measurements in 1978 and the present time. The ice core record provides
information on the changing !3C levels over the past few hundred years (Friedli et a/., 1986; Leuenberger et
al, 1992).

Relative to the long-term average rate of atmospheric CO, concentration increase (~1.5 ppmv/yr), the years
1988 to 1989 had relatively high CO, concentration growth rates (~2.0 ppmv/yr) while subsequent years
(1991 to 1992) had very low growth rates (0.5 ppmv/yr) (Boden et a/., 1991). The magnitude of the 1988 to
1989 anomaly depends on what is defined as “normal” for the long-term trend. At Mauna Loa, Hawaii, the
1988 to 1989 increase was similar to a variation which occurred in 1973 to 1974 (see Figure 1.2). The
subsequent decrease exceeds any previous anomaly since the Mauna Loa record began in 1958. Data for 1993
indicate a higher growth rate than that for 1991 to 1992.

The CO, record exhibits a seasonal cycle, with small peak-to-peak amplitude (about 1 ppmy) in the Southern
Hemisphere but increasing northward to about 15 ppmv in the boreal forest zone (55-65°N). This cycle is
mainly caused by the seasonal uptake and release of atmospheric CO, by terrestrial ecosystems. Part of the
seasonal signal is driven by oceanic processes (Heimann et al., 1989). The amplitude of the seasonal
atmospheric CO, cycle varies with time. For instance, at Mauna Loa (see Figure 1.3; Keeling et al., 1989a), it
was roughly constant at 5.2 ppmv (peak-to-trough) from the beginning of the Mauna Loa measurements in
1958 until the mid-1970s. It then increased over the late 1970s to reach 5.8 ppmv for most of the 1980s. The
most recent data indicate a further increase. Because the trend is not well-correlated with the CO,
concentration increase (Thompson ev al., 1986; Enting, 1987; Manning, 1993), it provides at best weak
evidence for CO, fertilisation of terrestrial vegetation, in contrast with interpretations that claimed strong
evidence (e.g., Idso and Kimball, 1993). The variation in amplitude does indicate changes in terrestrial
metabolism, but not necessarily increased photosynthesis or storage.

samples, absence of seasonal melting at the surface, no
chemical alteration of the initial concentrations, and
appropriate gas extraction methods, the ice record provides
reliable information on past atmospheric CO,

suggested that, under certain meteorological
circumstances, the CO, data from Greenland ice cores may
be contaminated, apparently influenced by varying levels
of carbonate dust interacting with acid (Delmas, 1993) or
organic matter deposition onto the ice sheet. Antarctic ice,
however, has been uniformly acidic throughout the
compicte range of climate regimes of the last climatic
cycle, and the available evidence suggests that these data
are reliable throughout the entire record. Data from
appropriate sites with unfractured ice are reliable to within
+3-5 ppmv (Raynaud et al., 1993). The recent ice core
record is validated by comparison with direct atmospheric
measurements (Neftel e¢ al., 1985; Friedli et al., 1986;

Clear correlations between CO, and global mean

temperature may carry forward into the future, possibly
causing a significant positive climatic feedback on CO,
fluxes. Information about leads and lags between climatic
variations and changes in radiatively active trace gas
concentrations is contained in polar ice and deep sea
sediment records (Raynaud and Siegenthaler, 1993). There
is no evidence that CO, changes ever significantly (> |

CO, changes clearly lag behind the Antarctic cooling at
the end of the last interglacial. As temperature changes in
the South generally preceded temperature changes in the
North (CLIMAP Project Members, 1984), it cannot be
assumed that CO, changes never led northern temperature
changes. Comparison of atmospheric CO, concentration
and continental ice volume suggests that CO, started to
change ahead of any significant melting of continental ice.
It is possible that CO, changes may have been caused by
changes in climate, and that CO, and other trace gases
acted to amplify palaeoclimatic changes.

Quay ef al. (1992) proposed a method to determine the
global budget from repeated measurements of vertical
profiles of the '3C/!?C ratio in oceanic dissolved inorganic
carbon. In principle, these observations allow us to
determine the rate of change of the oceanic '3C/!C ratio
which, together with the observed changes in the
atmospheric '3C/!2C ratio, provide another constraint on
the global carbon balance. The ratio permits discrimination
between oceanic and terrestrial biospheric sinks because
terrestrial uptake (photosynthesis) discriminates against the
heavy isotope (!3C) much more strongly than does ocean
uptake. A preliminary analysis based on a data set from
seven stations in the Pacific Ocean (sampled in the early
1970s and again in 1990) yielded a mean oceanic sink of

The trend in atmospheric oxygen, as revealed by
measurements of the oxygen to nitrogen ratio, can also be
used to assess the global carbon budget (Keeling and
Shertz. 1992: Bender et al., 1994), Oxygen in many
respects is complementary to carbon. It is consumed
during combustion and respiration and is released during
biotic carbon uptake via photosynthesis. The crucial
difference compared to carbon is that, owing to low
solubility of O, in water, the magnitude of the oceanic
oxygen pool is negligible and can be ignored in the global
oxygen balance. Therefore, measurements of the temporal
trend in atmospheric oxygen together with the known O:C
stoichiometric relations during combustion, respiration,
and photosynthesis, permit establishment of global oxygen
and carbon balances, although interannual variations in
marine photosynthesis and respiration may complicate the
interpretation of O:C data (Keeling and Severinghaus,

The problem of deducing sources and sinks of trace
gases from observations of surface concentrations presents
a considerable technical challenge. This is partly because
the small-scale features of the spatial distribution of
sources and sinks are blurred by atmospheric mixing. The
“reconstruction” process amplifies the small-scale details,
but the errors and uncertainties introduced along the way
are similarly amplified. Hence, there is a trade-off between
the spatial resolution sought and the accuracy of the
estimates obtained. Consequently, only a small number of
independent source/sink components can be reliably
determined from the data, and, in general, only the largest
spatial scales can be resolved (Enting, 1993). This
explains, in part, the range of interpretations obtained in
different studies. The uncertainty analysis of Enting ef al.
(1994a), indicates that such analyses cannot, on their own,
estimate global totals of net fluxes more accurately than
the classical approach to carbon budget analysis. Thus, at
present, the constraints from the spatial distribution of CO,
act mainly as consistency checks with budgets derived
of individual budget components.

reveal a strong Northern Hemisphere release, as
expected from increased use of fossil fuels. This
source is so strong that it tends to obscure other
details of the source-sink distribution and is
additional confirmation of the role of fossil fuel
emissions in atmospheric concentration change.

Northern Hemisphere sink. After subtracting the
fossil source, there is a strong net sink in the
Northern Hemisphere which may involve both
marine and terrestrial components (e.g., Tans ef al.,
1990). The partitioning remains controversial
(Keeling et al., 1989b; Ciais et al., submitted), but
recent isotopic analyses suggest an appreciable
terrestrial component (Ciais et al., submitted). A
Northern Hemisphere sink, as estimated by inverse

The marine biota, if in steady state, are believed to play
a minor role, if any at all, in the uptake of excess
anthropogenic CO. The marine biota, however, play a
crucial role in maintaining the steady-state level of
atmospheric CO,. About three-quarters of the vertical
gradient in dissolved inorganic carbon is generated by the
export of newly produced carbon from the surface ocean
and its regeneration at depth (a process referred to as
“biological pump”). In the open ocean, however, this
process is believed to be limited by the availability of
nutrients, light, or by phytoplantkon population control via
grazing, and not by the abundance of carbon (Falkowski
and Wilson, 1992). Therefore, a direct effect of increased
dissolved inorganic carbon (less than 2.5% since pre-
industrial times) on carbon fixation and export is unlikely,
although a recent study by Riebesell ef al. (1993)
suggested that under particular conditions the rate of
photosynthesis and hence phytoplankton growth might
indeed be limited by the availability of CO, as a dissolved
gas. The global significance of this effect, however,
remains to be assessed. (See Section 1.4.3 for a discussion
of the potential indirect effects of increased dissolved
inorganic carbon.)

dissolved inorganic carbon would have to be measured
with an accuracy of better than 1% in order to determine
the carbon balance in a particular oceanic region. While
such accuracy can be obtained, a substantial sampling
effort is required (Keeling, 1993). Determination of the
global oceanic budget by this approach does not appear
feasible in the near future. However, repeated
observational surveys might reveal regional carbon
inventory changes, and thus might provide a cross-check

The present-day oceanic uptake of excess CO, is estimated
using ocean carbon model simulation experiments, with
observed atmospheric CO, concentration as a prescribed
boundary condition. It is only necessary to model the
transport and mixing of the excess carbon perturbation if
the marine biota are assumed to remain on an annual
average in a steady state, as excess CO, will disperse
within the ocean like a passive tracer, independent of the
background natural distribution of dissolved inorganic
carbon. In particular, the perturbation excludes a natural
cycle of carbon transported by rivers, outgassed by the
oceans and then taken up by the terrestrial biota.

"Here, discharge of excess nutrients by rivers might have
significantly stimulated carbon fixation (up to 0.5-1.0
GtC/yr). At present, however, it is not known how much of
this excess organic carbon is simply reoxidised, and how
much is permanently sequestered by export to the deep
ocean, or in sediments on the shelves and shallow seas.
Because of the limited surface area, a burial rate
significantly excecding 0.5 GtC/yr is not very likely, as it
would require all coastal seas to be under-saturated in
partial pressure of CO, by more than 50 gatm on annual
average, in order to supply the carbon from the
atmosphere. Such under-saturations have been
documented, e.g., in the North Sea (Kempe and Pegler,
1991), but these measurements are unlikely to be
representative of all coastal oceans. Based on the above
considerations, the role of the coastal ocean is judged most
likely to be small, but, at present, cannot be accurately
assessed and so is neglected in the budget presented in this
chapter (Table 1.3).

"oceans and then taken up by the terrestrial biota.

Until recently, most models of the oceanic uptake of
anthropogenic CO, consisted of a series of well-mixed or
diffusive reservoirs (“boxes”) representing the major
oceanic water masses, connected by exchange of water
(Oeschger et al., 1975). Global transport characteristics of
these models were obtained from simulation studies of the
oceanic penetration of bomb radiocarbon ('4C) validated
by comparison with observations (Broecker et al., 1985).
Bomb radiocarbon, however, does not accurately track the
oceanic invasion of anthropogenic carbon, because oceanic
concentration changes of carbon isotopes depend on the
full time history of those inputs and !4C entered the ocean
with an atmospheric history different from that of natural
CO,. Furthermore, CO, uptake depends on chemical
interactions with dissolved inorganic C, while uptake of
'4C does not. Nevertheless, bomb radiocarbon provides a
powerful constraint on ocean carbon models, a constraint
which may be supplemented by analyses of other steady
state and transient tracers, such as halocarbons, tritium
from nuclear weapon testing, and possibly !3C.

Exchanges of carbon between the atmosphere and the
oceans (net air-sea fluxes) can be deduced from
measurements of the partial pressure difference of CO,
between the air and surface waters. This calculation also
requires knowledge of the local gas-exchange coefficient,
which is a relatively poorly known quantity (Watson,
1993). Furthermore, while the globally and seasonally
averaged partial pressure of surface waters is close to the
value for equilibrium with the atmosphere, large
geographical and seasonal variations exist, induced both
by physical processes (upwelling, vertical mixing, sea
surface temperature fluctuations) and by the activity of the
marine biota. Representative estimates of the seasonally
and regionally averaged net air-sea carbon transfer thus
necessitates sampling with high spatial and temporal
resolution (Garcon ef a/., 1992). Estimates of the regional
net air-sea carbon fluxes have been obtained, albeit with

The average of modelled rates of oceanic carbon uptake
is 2.0 GtC/yr over the decade 1980 to 1989 (Orr, 1993;
Siegenthaler and Sarmiento, 1993). This value is
corroborated by model experiments projecting future
concentrations of atmospheric CO, (see Section 1.5, and
Enting et al., 1994b) and by a simulation with a newly-
developed two-dimensional global ocean model (Table
1.1; Stocker et al., 1994). The spread of the modelled
uptake rates corresponds to a statistical uncertainty of only
about + 0.5 GtC/yr (at the 90% confidence level).
However, recent assessments of the global radiocarbon
balance (Broecker and Peng, 1994; Hesshaimer ef al.,

box models tuned by bomb radiocarbon might have to be
tevised downwards by up to 25%. Furthermore, the spread
of the OGCM results listed in Table 1.1 might be
fortuitously small! in view of the similar deficiencies in
these models. Based on these considerations we do not

Deforestation and other changes in land use (including
land management) cause significant exchanges of CO,
between the land and atmosphere. Changes in land use
from 1850 to 1990 resulted in cumulative emissions of 122
+ 40 GtC (Houghton, 1994a). From the last century
through the 1940s, expansion of agriculture and forestry in
the middle and high latitudes dominated carbon emissions
from the terrestrial biosphere (Houghton and Skole, 1990).
Since then, conversion of temperate forests for agricultural
use has diminished and forests are regrowing in previously
logged forests and on abandoned agricultural lands
(Melillo e¢ al., 1988; Birdsey et al., 1993; Dixon et al.,
1994), Emissions from the tropics have generally been
increasing since the 1950s. Estimates for 1980 range from
0.4 to 2.5 GtC (Houghton et al., 1987; Detwiler and Hall,
1988; Watson et al., 1990).

anthropogenic nitrogen has been deposited by the
atmosphere on regrowing forests of the middle and

storage in these regions. Recent measurements of
mid-latitude and high latitude forest regrowth may
therefore reflect the combined effects of nitrogen
deposition, elevated CO, concentrations, and climate
variability. Also, CO, fertilisation can affect the
nitrogen cycle and vice versa (see Section 1.4.2). It

A more fundamental problem is the confusion of carbon
uptake via forest growth versus forest regrowth. As a basis
for understanding how fluxes might change in the future,
we seek in this report to separate increases in forest carbon
storage that result from the regrowth of previously
harvested forests versus storage due to processes such as
CO, fertilisation, nitrogen deposition, and changes in fire
frequency, management practices, or climate, all of which
can affect forest growth. Inventory-based estimates of
forest carbon storage are made by multiplying the age
Jistribution of forest stands (rates of carbon accumulation
generally decrease as stands age) by age-specific rates of
carbon accumulation, estimated from observations.
However, as forest carbon accumulation has been
measured during the period of changing CO, and nitrogen
deposition, and possibly climate, forest inventories cannot
distinguish the amount of accumulation attributable to
individual processes.

While little has been done to increase understanding of
potential sinks in tropical forests, analyses based on
models of forest growth, age distribution data, and the age-
growth relationship suggest carbon accumulation in
Northern Hemisphere forests may be as high as ~1 GtC/yr
(Dixon et al., 1994). Analyses based on observed
atmospheric CO, and C0, suggest a strong Northern
Hemisphere terrestrial sink. While various pieces of
evidence support a substantial terrestrial sink in the
Northern Hemisphere, direct observations to confirm the
hypothesis and to establish the processes responsible for
increasing carbon storage are lacking. For example, tree
ting studies of contemporary and pre-industrial forest
growth rates are contradictory. These studies have revealed
enhanced growth in subalpine conifers (LaMarche et al.,
1984), no growth enhancement beyond that explained by
climatic variability (Graumlich, 1991; D’Arrigo and
Jacoby, 1993), and both positive and negative changes in
growth rate dependent upon species and location (Briffa et
al., 1990). Models and observational data to confirm
tropical sinks are even more deficient (e.g., Brown and
Lugo, 1984; 1992; Fearnside, 1992; Skole and Tucker,
1993; Dixon ef al., 1994). Improved observations for
identifying terrestrial sinks is necessary for the
improvement of models capable of projecting future states
of the carbon cycle, and also for quantifying regional
contributions to terrestrial sources and sinks. Processes
that may contribute to a terrestrial sink are explored below

CO, fertilisation could stimulate biological nitrogen

are stimulated by increasing CO,, acclimation of carbon
storage to higher CO, levels could be temporarily offset.
However, evidence from native ecosystems suggests that

Experimental studies of agricultural and wild plant species
have shown growth responses of typically 20-40% higher
growth under doubled CO, conditions (ranging from
negligible or negative responses in some wild plants to
responses of 100% in some crop species (Kérner and

these studies were short-term and were conducted with
potted plants (Idso and Idso, 1994). The effect of increased
growth under elevated CO, conditions, known as the CO,
fertilisation effect, is often assumed to be the primary
mechanism underlying the imbalance in the global carbon
budget. This assumption implies a terrestrial sink that
increases as CO, increases, acting as a strong negative
feedback. However, while the potential effect of CO, in
experimental and some field studies is relatively strong
(c.g., Drake, 1992; Idso and Kimball, 1993; see also

"Climate effects

Climate affects carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems
because temperature, moisture, and radiation influence
both ecosystem carbon gain (photosynthesis) and loss
(respiration) (Houghton and Woodwell, 1989; Schimel er
al., 1994). While a number of compensatory processes are
possible, warming is thought to reduce carbon storage by
increasing respiration, especially of soils (Houghton and
Woodwell, 1989; Shaver et al., 1992; Townsend et al.,
1992; Oechel et al., 1993; Schimel e¢ al., 1994).
Conversely, cooling would be expected to increase carbon
storage. In nutrient-limited forests, however, warming may
increase carbon storage by “mineralising” soil organic
nutrients, which are generally stored in nutrient-rich, or
low carbon-to-nutrient ratio forms, thereby allowing
increased uptake by trees, which store nutrients in high
carbon-to-nutrient forms (Shaver et a/., 1992). This is not
true in nutrient-limited tundra ecosystems, where recent
warming has resulted in a local CO, source (Oechel ef al.,
1993). Increases in precipitation will generally increase
carbon storage by increasing plant growth, although in
some ecosystems compensatory increases in soil
decomposition may reduce or offset this effect (Ojima ef
al., 1993). While these effects have been discussed as
components of future responses of ecosystems to climate
change, climate variations during the past century may
have influenced the terrestrial carbon budget. In a
provocative paper, Dai and Fung (1993) suggested that
climate variations over the past decades could have
resulted in a substantial sink. Ciais ef a/. (in press)
suggested that cooling arising from the effects of Mt.
Pinatubo may have increased terrestrial carbon storage and
contributed to the observed reduction in the atmospheric
growth rate during the 1991 to 1992 period. Palaeoclimate
modelling studies likewise suggest major changes in
terrestrial carbon storage with climate (Prentice and Fung,
1990; Friedlingstein et a/., 1992). Modelling and
observations of ecosystem responses to climate and
climate anomalies will be important tools for validating
predictions of future changes; meanwhile, investigations of
the effects of climate on carbon storage remain suggestive
rather than definitive.

"1.4.2 Feedbacks to Terrestrial Carbon Storage

The responses of terrestrial carbon to climate are complex,
with rates of biological activity generally increasing with
warmer temperatures and increasing moisture. Because
photosynthesis and plant growth increase with warmer
temperatures, longer growing seasons and more available
water, storage of carbon in living vegetation generally
increases as well (Melillo et a/., 1993). Storage of carbon
in soils generally increases along a gradient from low to
high latitudes, reflecting slower decomposition of dead
plant material in colder environments (Post ef al., 1985;
Schimel ef af., 1994). Flooded soils, where oxygen
becomes depleted, have extremely low rates of
decomposition and may accumulate large amounts of
organic matter as peat. Global ecosystem models based on
an understanding of underlying mechanisms are designed
to capture these patterns, and have been used to simulate
the responses of terrestrial carbon storage to changing
climate, Some models also include the effect of changes in
land use. Model results suggest that future effects of
changing climate, atmospheric CO,, and changing land use

instantaneous doubling of CO,. The results of this
experiment showed that, over the period of CO, doubling
uptake of carbon only occurred when the CO, fertilisatior

of vegetation. Their results revealed eventual increased
carbon storage of ~200-250 Gt, depending on assumptions
of future land use. Results from ecosystem models sugges!
that changes in climate associated with CO, doubling are
likely to lead to a significant transient release of carbon
(1-4 GtC/yr) over a period of decades to more than a

production (Martin, 1990). Changes in atmospheric iron
loading thus potentially could affect the biological pump
and impact atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Modelling
studies have shown, however, that even excessive “iron
fertilisation” of these oceanic areas would have a relatively
small impact on atmospheric CO, levels (Joos et al..
1991a; Peng and Broecker, 1991; Sarmiento and Orr,
1991; Kurz and Maier-Reimer, 1993). Therefore, at least
during the past 200 years, it is very unlikely that iron
loading had a significant impact on the present day carbon
balance.

Increased ultraviolet radiation (UV-B, corresponding tc
light wavelengths of 280-320 nm) resulting from the
depletion of stratospheric ozone could affect marine life
and thus influence marine carbon storage. However, mode!
simulation studies show that even a complete cessation ol
marine productivity in high latitudes, where increases in
UV-B are expected to occur, would result in an
atmospheric CO, increase of less than 40 ppmy (Sarmiento

Second, changes in the vertical water mass transports
would affect the marine biological pump. This would
reduce the flux of nutrients transported to the surface and,
in nutrient-limited regions, result in reduced marine
production. This effect would constitute a weakening of
the marine biological pump (i.e., less export of carbon to
depth), and could potentially lead to an increase in
dissolved inorganic carbon and partial pressure of CO, at
the surface. Conversely, smaller vertical water mass
transports imply a reduced upward transport of deeper
waters enriched in dissolved inorganic carbon, The two
effects result from the same process, but affect the surface
concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon, and hence the
partial pressure and the air-sea flux of CO,, in opposite
directions. The latter of the two effects dominates in
models that use constant carbon to nutrient ratios to
describe the marine biosphere (Bacastow and Maier-
Reimer, 1990; Keir, 1994), These models project a small
increase in oceanic carbon storage as a result of the
reduction of oceanic circulation and vertical mixing.

Initial model results suggest that the effects of predicted
changes in circulation on the ocean carbon cycle are not
large (10s rather than 100s of ppmvy in the atmosphere).
However, exploration of the long-term impacts of warming
on circulation patterns has just begun; hence, analyses of

impacts on the carbon cycle must be viewed as
preliminary. For example, changes in the oceanic
environment (temperature and circulation) have the
potential to change the composition of marine ecosystems
in ways not yet included in global models. This could lead
to changes in carbon to nutrient ratios, which are assumed
constant in present models, or to changes in the
relationship between organic and inorganic carbon
fixation, and/or change the efficiency by which marine
organisms utilise available nutrients. Furthermore, the
remineralisation depths of nutrients and carbon might be
affected differently (Evans and Fasham, 1993). An
extreme lower bound may be estimated by assuming
complete utilisation of the oceanic surface nutrients which
would reduce atmospheric CO, by 120 ppmvy. Similarly, an
upper bound is given by assuming extinction of all marine
life, increasing atmospheric CO, by almost 170 ppmv
(Bacastow and Maier-Reimer. 1990: Shaffer, 1993; Keir,
1994). Such large effects, however, are very unlikely to
occur. Indeed, the oceanic carbon system appears to be
rather stable as evidenced by the very small fluctuations of
the atmospheric CO, concentration prior to anthropogenic
perturbation. It has also proven very difficult to account

future land use fluxes, and a variety of time-series of

"The approach used in balancing the budget probably
biases the modelling exercise for this chapter towards
lower concentrations when emission profiles were
employed and higher anthropogenic emissions when
concentrations were prescribed. There are two reasons for
this. First, the effect of forest regrowth and nitrogen
deposition result in changing terrestrial carbon storage
which need not increase with increasing CO,
concentrations as is required by the CO, fertilisation
effect. Second, as noted in previous IPCC reports (Watson
et al., 1990; 1992) climate-related feedbacks may result in
additional transient releases of CO, to the atmosphere. In
contrast, most of the calculations employed in the 1990
IPCC assessment (Watson er al., 1990) assumed constant
terrestrial carbon content after 1990 and probably resulted
in biases in the other direction. Revisions to the 1980s
budget used in model initialisation for this report,
however, are in a direction that would lead to higher
concentrations by 5 to 10% (for given emissions) and
lower emissions by a similar amount (for given
concentrations).

"Results from a range of different carbon cycle models
are considered in order to assess the sensitivity of
calculated emission and concentration profiles to model
formulation. The complexity of the models employed
varies considerably. The most detailed was a model
coupling a three-dimensional ocean circulation and
chemistry model to a terrestrial biosphere model
incorporating a full geographical representation of
ecological processes; but, as with other complex models,
only a small set of calculations could be performed. The
simplest models were designed to simulate only critical
processes and represent terrestrial and oceanic carbon
uptake with a minimum number of equations. Because
most of the models employed incorporate some
representation of terrestrial processes, they tended to have
initially higher rates of CO, uptake from the atmosphere
and produced lower estimates for the effective lifetime of
CO, than the models used in the 1990 IPCC report (Moore
and Braswell, 1994). Thus, the GWPs presented in Chapter
5 of this volume are higher for other trace gases than those
of earlier assessments (Watson et al., 1990; Chapter 5, this

"volume).

We chose one model, the “Bern model”, for a number of
important illustrative calculations, because its results were
generally near the mid-point of the results obtained with all
models, and because complete descriptions exist in the
literature (Joos et al., 1991a; Siegenthaler and Joos, 1992).
Selected sensitivity analyses from the model of Wigley
(1993) were also used as the configuration of that model
allowed for ready modification to consider certain issues.
Both the Bern and Wigley models have a balanced carbon
cycle consisting of a well-mixed atmosphere linked to
oceanic and terrestrial biospheric compartments. In the
Bern model, the ocean is represented by the HILDA
model, which is a box-diffusion model with an additional
advective component. It was tuned to observed values of
natural and bomb radiocarbon (Joos et al., 1991a, b;
Siegenthaler and Joos, 1992) and validated with CFCs and
Argon-39 (Joos, 1992). The Wigley model uses a
representation of the ocean based on the ocean gencral
circulation carbon cycle model of Maier-Reimer and
Hasselmann (1987). Both the models have similar
terrestrial components, with representations of ground
vegetation, wood, detritus, and soil (Siegenthaler and
Oeschger, 1987; Wigley, 1993). A possible enhancement
of plant growth due to elevated CO, levels is taken into
account by a logarithmic dependency between additional
photosynthesis and atmospheric CO,, which, in the Bern
model, probably overestimates biological storage at high
CO, concentrations. The Bern model was chosen for
illustrative purposes in discussions where presentation of
multiple results would be confusing (and where all models
produced similar patterns). This model was also used to
define the reference case for the GWPs presented in

or decreased at 1% or 2%/yr (see Figure 1.10), For the

2100 and remained zero thereafter. Concentration results

Six greenhouse gas emissions scenarios were described in
the 1992 IPCC report (Leggett et al., 1992), based on a
wide range of assumptions regarding future economic,
demographic, and policy factors. The anthropogenic CO,
emissions for these scenarios are shown in Figure 1.9a.
Scenario IS92c, which has the lowest co, emissions,
assumes an eventual decrease in population, low economic
growth, and severe constraints on the availability of fossil
fucl supplies. The highest emission scenario (1S92e)
assumes moderate population growth, high economic
growth, high fossil fuel availability, and a phase-out of
nuclear power. Concentration estimates for these scenarios
have previously been published (e.g., Wigley, 1993).
Figure 1.9b shows concentration results from the Bern
model that typify the responses of the wide range of
models used for the full analysis. This and the other
models show strong increases in concentration to well
above pre-industrial levels by 2100 (75 to 220% higher).
None of the six scenarios leads to stabilisation of
concentration before 2100, although [S92c leads to a very
slow growth in CO, concentration after 2050. IS92a, b, e,
and f all produce a doubling of the pre-industrial CO,
concentration before 2070, with rapid rates of
concentration growth, Scenarios developed by the World
Energy Council show a similar range of results (Figures

Several carbon cycle models have been used to calculate
the emissions of CO, that would lead to stabilisation at a
range of different concentration levels. These calculations
are designed to illustrate the relationship between CO,
concentration and emissions. Concentration profiles have
been devised (Figure 1.12) in which CO, concentrations
stabilise at levels from 350 to 750 ppmv (for comparison,
the pre-industrial CO, concentration was close to 280
ppmv and the 1990 concentration was ~355 ppmv). Many
different stabilisation levels and routes to stabilisation
could have been chosen. Those in Figure 1.12 give a
smooth transition from the 1990 rate of CO, concentration
increase to stabilisation. As a result, the year of
stabilisation differs with stabilisation levels from around
2150 for 350 ppmv to 2250 for 750 ppmv. Further details
on the concentration profiles, and the implied emissions
tesults are given in Enting et al. (1994b).

Two types of uncertainty analysis have been performed for
the emission-concentration modelling studies. First,
because the models used in the intercomparison
incorporate model components of differing structure and
levels of complexity to calculate terrestrial and ocean
uptake, the range of results provides a view of
uncertainties arising from different scientific approaches.
While this is a useful view, it probably underestimates the
overall uncertainty because the experiments were
constrained to have a specific value for the flux arising
from changing land use during the 1980s, and a terrestrial
sink due solely to CO, fertilisation, Because ocean sink
magnitudes were not constrained, models with smaller
atmosphere-to-ocean fluxes have correspondingly (and
possibly unrealistically) larger terrestrial sinks. None of
the models used for the terrestrial sink process adequately

Although a complete assessment of model sensitivity
and uncertainties (e.g., following Gardner and Trabalka,

out for this assessment, several specific model sensitivities
have been studied. Figure 1.15 shows the sensitivity of
future concentrations under emission scenario [$92a to
varied strength of biospheric uptake. In this experiment
(Wigley, 1993), the effectiveness of CO, fertilisation was
varied across the range thought to be reasonable (10-40%

Significant changes in projected concentrations occur
depending upon the CO, fertilisation factor used, by

The annual CH, increase from 1991 to 1992 was much
smaller than in the previous decade, 1992 to 1993 levels
were unchanged, and in late 1993 CH, apparently started
to increase again. This anomaly was largest at high
latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, and could be
explained by a rapid drop, of about 5%, in global annual
emissions. Longer-period variations in the growth rate of

Atmospheric CH, concentrations have increased from
about 700 ppbv in pre-industrial times to a global mean of
1714 ppbv in 1992. The 1980s were characterised by
declining methane growth rates which were approximately
10 ppbv/yr by the end of the decade. The average growth
rate of 13 ppbv/yr corresponds to an imbalance between
sources and sinks of about 37 Tg(CH,)/yr. If emissions
were frozen at this level, CH, would rise to about 1900
ppbv over the next 50 years. If emissions were cut by 37
Tg(CH,)/yr, then CH, concentrations would remain at
today’s levels. Current estimates of the CH, budget assign
20-40% to natural sources, 20% to anthropogenic fossil

Methane is the only long-lived gas that has clearly
identified chemical feedbacks: increases in atmospheric
CH, reduce the concentration of tropospheric hydroxyl
radical (OH), increase the CH, lifetime and hence amplify
the original CH, perturbation. A recent analysis has shown
that these feedbacks result in an adjustment time for
additional emissions of CH, equal to 14.5 + 2.5 years
based on a “budget” lifetime of about 10 years that reflects
atmospheric chemical losses alone. It is uncertain how
much the adjustment time would be affected by the small
biological sink, and a range of 11 to 17 years encompasses
this additional uncertainty. This lengthening of the
effective duration of a CH, pulse applies also to any
derived perturbations (e.g., in tropospheric O,).

The Earth’s atmosphere is composed primarily of the gases
N, (78% dry), O (21%) and Ar (1%), whose abundances
are controlled over geologic time-scales by uptake and
release from crustal material, by degassing of the interior
and by the biosphere. Water vapour (H,O) is the next
largest, though highly variable, constituent present mainly
in the lower atmosphere at concentrations as high as 3%,
where evaporation and precipitation control its abundance.
The remaining gaseous constituents are considered trace
gases, comprising less than 1% of the atmosphere, yet
playing a disproportionately important role in the Earth’s
radiative balance. Among these, the greenhouse gases
include ozone (O;), methane (CH,), nitrous oxide (N,O),
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), H,O in the upper atmosphere,
as well as carbon dioxide (CO,). All but CO, are
controlled in one way or another by atmospheric
chemistry. Table 2.1 summarises the mean tropospheric
abundance and atmospheric burdens of the more important
of these gases.

eee

The climatic impacts of the radiatively active trace gases
increase as their global mean abundances increase. It is
important to understand the atmospheric chemical cycles
involving these gases in order to comprehend the changes
in atmospheric composition observed to date and to predict
future composition in response to alterations in natural and
human-induced emissions. This chapter describes the life
cycles of the more important gases, noting how chemical
reactions in the atmosphere balance the emissions. A brief
teview of important chemical processes and of the concept
of residence times is followed by a summary of the known
sources, sinks and time-scales affecting CH,, N,O and the
halocarbons (chlorine and bromine containing organic
compounds such as the CFCs). Ozone is a special case
emphasising the complexities of atmospheric chemistry:
direct emissions of O, are not important; in situ
production, loss and transport by the atmospheric
circulation control its abundance. The net production in the
lower atmosphere is controlled by a suite of short-lived
trace gases (NO + NO, (= NO,), non-methane
hydrocarbons (NMHC) and carbon monoxide (CO)), as
well as CH,. These gases are not significant for their direct
radiative effects, but rather for their ability to control the
abundances of O, and other greenhouse gases such as CH,.

is controlled by a balance between this production and
transport and the catalytic loss-cycles involving Cl and Br

stratospheric Cl today, 80%, is the family of industrial
chlorocarbons, and human activity has also led to increases

Most trace gases have little impact on the chemistry of the

the global mean abundance (Tg) with the inverse global

For example, it has been known that the CH,-CO-OH
system in the troposphere is highly coupled (Chameides et
al., 1976; Sze, 1977): increased CH, oxidation leads to
additional CO formation; both suppress OH, the major sink
for CHy; and thus the time-scale for decay of the
perturbation lengthens. This feedback was reported by the
global models and treated in IPCC (1990) as an “indirect”
GWP based on model calculations of the decrease in
global OH for CH, increases (Isaksen and Hov, 1987).
However, the concept of an extended adjustment time for
perturbations has not been applied to GWPs until! this
assessment. The ratio of adjustment time to lifetime is
greater than one and is independent of the magnitude of
the methane perturbation for modest changes (Prather.
1994). Because of differing NO, and NMHC fields.
models of global tropospheric chemistry differ in the
strength of their CH,-CO-OH coupling (see Section
2.10.2). Thus the adopted adjustment time for CH,, based
on atmospheric chemistry alone, is 14 + 2.5 yr using a
chemical sink (OH and stratospheric loss) of 10 yr. If the
biological soil sink were to respond to the atmosphere in
the same way as the chemical sink, the response time
would be reduced to a little under 14 yr. In this chapter we
use the range 14 + 3 (11-17) yr to cover this uncertainty.

The discussion of adjustment time and turn-over time
has assumed that we are dealing with small perturbations
about the current atmosphere. We have observed changes
in CH,, N,O and probably tropospheric O, since the pre-
industrial atmosphere (see following discussion). These
changes have been large, and we expect that the
adjustment times for most gases have changed since 1850
and will continue to change into the future in response to
changing emissions of a wide range of gases. Current

"CH,CCI, fulfils all of the above requirements for
calibrating tropospheric OH. A recent assessment (Kaye ef
al, 1994) has reviewed and re-evaluated the lifetimes of
two major industrial halocarbons, methylchloroform
(CH,CCI,) and CFC-11. An optimal fit to the observed
concentrations of CH,CCI, from the five ALE/GAGE
surface sites over the period 1978 to 1990 was done with
two statistical/atmospheric models: the ALE/GAGE 12-
box atmospheric model with optimal inversion (Prinn eft
al, 1992): and the NCSU/UCI 3D-GISS model with
autoregression statistics (Kaye et al., 1994). There are
well-defined differences in the two atmospheric models’
simulations; while important for modelling CFC-E1, these
have no impact on the derived CH,CCI, lifetimes. But the
empirical lifetime and its possible trend are closely tied to
the absolute calibration of CH,CCIl, measurements. With
the ALE/GAGE calibration factor, a lifetime of 5.7+ 0.3 yr
in 1990 with a decrease in lifetime of 1+ 0.8%/yr from
1978 to 1990 is obtained. For the calibration factor from
CMDL (0.88 times the ALE/GAGE value, Fraser et al,
1994), a lifetime of 5.1 + 0.3 with a significantly smaller
trend is derived. The interpretation of such a trend as
increasing tropospheric OH is unresolved, since other
factors, including the known geographic change in
CH,CCI, emissions, may influence the observations.

Short-lived trace gases such as NO, (1-10 days) and CO
(1-4 months) have not been included in this discussion
because it is impossible to assign a useful global mean
lifetime. Such gases have highly variable local loss rates,
e.g., CO varies from 1 per month in the tropics, and 0.25
per month at mid-latitudes in spring and autumn, to very
small values in high latitude winter. The atmospheric
circulation does not mix CO from equator to pole within
the troposphere in much less than a season. Thus emissions
of CO in the tropics will decay in a month, whereas high
latitude emissions in winter will accumulate for a season
until they mix to lower latitudes. In the case of long-lived
gases such as CH, with an adjustment time of about 11 to
17 years, the surface emissions become reasonably well-
mixed throughout the troposphere before substantial losses
occur, and thus the adjustment time does not depend on the
location of the sources. For short-lived gases this is not
true and they do not in general have well defined
adjustment times, although a reasonable upper limit can be
made by combining the chemistry with the atmospheric
transport models. Given the finite rate of tropospheric
mixing (about two weeks vertically, about three months
from pole to tropics, and about one year between
hemispheres) the concept of a global adjustment time as
currently used in GWPs is of limited use for molecules
such as NO,, O, or even CO.

This range has shifted little from previous estimates in
IPCC (1992). In fact, despite numerous publications of
numerous new flux measurements and estimates, only few
of the contributions from individual sources have been
revised. These revisions are relatively small, usually
concerned with the range rather than with the central
values of the emissions estimates. Thus, recent flux data
from the Amazon region suggest that a large fraction of
CH, is emitted from tropical wetlands (20°N — 30°S), with
a global estimate of ~60 Tg(CH,)/yr (Bartlett e¢ al., 1990;

indicate emissions ranging from 20 to 60 Tg/yr (Whalen

evaluation of the ocean source (Lambert and Schmidt,
1993) suggests only ~3.5 Tg/yr are emitted by the open
ocean, but emissions from methane-rich areas could be
higher, pushing the upper limit of the oceanic source to 50
Tg/yr. A recent estimate made by Martius ef al. (1993) for
the contribution of termites to the global budget agrees
well with the central value of 20 Tg/yr given in the IPCC

The varied chemical and physical couplings in the
atmospheric system mean that a perturbation in one trace
gas propagates through a series of interactions into a
perturbation of many other species. Methane has an
especially large number of identified couplings, some of
which are used as an example to illustrate this point. To
first order, a kilogram of CH, released from the surface
becomes well-mixed in troposphere, and a fraction of this
CH,, in proportion to its tropical abundance, is transported
into the stratosphere. This added kilogram of CH, decays
with an adjustment time of 11 to 17 years and not with the
chemical sink time-scale of 10 years due to OH and
stratospheric loss (see Section 2.2.2 above). This enhanced
CH, concentration has a direct radiative effect. In the
stratosphere, CH, directly affects the radical chemistry
(CI/HCI, OH) that controls O3: by reducing the
effectiveness of chlorine catalytic cycles, it would increase
O,. At the same time, oxidation of this CH, increases
stratospheric H,O, leading to enhanced efficiency of the
HO,-catalysed O, loss and potentially increasing
heterogeneous chemistry in the stratosphere by providing
more condensable water. Changes to stratospheric H,O
and O, have direct greenhouse impacts. Any induced
changes to stratospheric O3 will feed back on tropospheric
chemistry through changes in UV and O, fluxes into the
troposphere. The additional CH, also impacts tropospheric
chemistry directly through reductions in OH and increased
production of O,. Lower OH increases the lifetimes and
hence the concentrations of a whole host of atmospheric
trace gases, many of which are direct greenhouse gases.
Further, the concentrations of HCFCs and CH,CCI, would
increase with a secondary impact on stratospheric chlorine
levels and hence O,. Another secondary impact is in

Anastasi and Simpson (1993) estimated a 1990 emission
of 84 Tg/yr from enteric fermentation in cattle, sheep, and
buffalo, which contributes 90% of the total emission from
domestic animals, towards the upper part of the range
given in IPCC (1992) (65-100 Tg/yr). In a complete re-
evaluation of emissions from biomass burning, Andreac
and Warneck (1994) report a total of 43 Tg/yr in good
agreement with the global estimates made in IPCC (1992).
Other recent estimates of CH, from biomass burning are
30 Tg/yr (Hao and Ward, 1993), 35 Tg/yr (Subak ef al.,

"Atmospheric CH, concentrations have changed
considerably over time. Most striking is the increase of
more than a factor of two over the last two centuries,
derived from air trapped in ice cores (Figure 2.1). During
the past decade the rate of that increase has declined.
Measurements from two global observing networks have
derived globally averaged growth rates for methane of
approximately 20 ppbv/yr in 1979-80, 13 ppbv/yr in 1983,
10 ppbv/yr in 1990 and about 5 ppbv/yr in 1992 (Steele er

the 30°-90°N semi-hemisphere than in the other semi-

As detailed in Section 2.2, CH, is removed from the
atmosphere through reaction with tropospheric OH, about
445 Tg/yr (Table 2.3) and stratospheric removal, 40 Tg/yr.
Another significant sink is the microbial uptake in soils,
about 15-45 Tg(CH,)/yr. A growing number of studies
(reviewed by Reeburgh ef al., 1993) show that methane
from the atmosphere, and also that diffusing upward from
deep soils, is consumed by microbial communities in the
upper soils. Methane fluxes at the terrestrial and marine
surface are highly variable because they result from the
difference of two large processes (in situ production and
consumption). It is noted that this oxidation of CH, is also
important in modulating methane emissions from rice
paddies, wetlands and landfills. Disturbance (cultivation,
fertilisation) has been shown to reduce the effectiveness of
the soil sink in temperate soils (Keller et a/., 1990; Mosier

records that begin at about 1300 and 1600 respectively and
continue to about 1950. The pre-industrial global mean and
inter-hemispheric difference were found to be about 720-
740 ppbv and 35-75 ppbv respectively, about one third of
the present day difference, indicating that the pre-industrial
natural sources in the Northern Hemisphere were larger
than those in the Southern Hemisphere. A Greenland ice
core has produced a further methane record over the past
1000 years (Blunier et al., 1993). A similar pre-industrial
level was found (700 ppbv) and pre-industrial variations of
about 70 ppbv were detected before AD 1500 which are
attributed to the changed oxidising capacity of the
atmosphere, climatic impacts on wetlands and possible
agricultural sources of methane. Further back in time, large
changes in the methane concentration in Greenland ice
cores through the deglaciation and the last glacial period
are observed to be in phase with inferred temperature

Persistent water table lowering of 50-75 cm resulted in

Tropical forest soils are probably the single most important
source of nitrous oxide to the atmosphere. New data on
tropical land-use changes and intensification of tropical
agriculture indicate significant, growing sources of N,O
(Matson and Vitousck, 1990). The flux of N,O depends on
the age of the pasture, with young pasture (<10 years)
emitting 3-10 times more N,O than tropical forests,
whereas older pastures emit less N,O than tropical forest
(Keller et al., 1993). However, further research on tropical
agricultural systems is required before conclusions can be
reached concerning the relative importance of tropical
agricultural systems as growing N,O sources (Keller and
Matson, 1994). The total NO source from tropical soils
(forest, savannah) is estimated at 4 Tg(N)/yr (range 2.7 -
5.7). The magnitude of N,O emissions from intensively
fertilised tropical agricultural soils has not been quantified.
No attempt has been made to speciate the tropical soil
source into natural and anthropogenic components. More

Previously, ice core records of nitrous oxide showed an
increase of about 8% over the industrial period (Etheridge
etal., 1988; Khalil and Rasmussen, 1988a; Zardini ef al.,
1989). A new record covering the last 45,000 years was
obtained from two ice cores from Antarctica and
Greenland (Leucnberger and Siegenthaler, 1992). The
Greenland record covers the period 1780 to 1950 and
suggests a pre-industrial nitrous oxide level of about 260
ppbv, 10 and 25 ppbv lower than other records, Results
from a new Antarctic core (Machida et al., 1994) indicate
a pre-industrial level of about 273 ppbv. Thus estimates of
pre-industrial levels of N.O average about 275 ppbv with a
range of 260 to 285 ppbv. Nitrous oxide levels have risen
approximately 15% since pre-industrial times. The
Antarctic core shows that nitrous oxide was about 30%
lower than these pre-industrial levels (about 180-190 ppbv)

The major sink for N,O is photodissociation by sunlight
(wavelengths 180-230 nm) in the stratosphere; a secondary
removal process, about 10%, occurs through reaction with
O('D). The best estimates for the lifetime of N,O come
from the 2D stratospheric chemical transport models that
have been tested against observed distributions and tracer-
tracer correlations (Prather & Remsberg, 1993) and that
include the accurate modelling of transmission of
ultraviolet sunlight (Minschwaner ef al., 1993). The
current best estimate for stratospheric removal is 120 + 30
yt. Mahlman et al. (1986) reached a similar conclusion
based upon 3-D transport model considerations. There is
some evidence that N,O is consumed by some soils (cf.
Donoso et al., 1993), but there are not enough data to
make a reasonable global estimate of this sink. The
consequences of a significant ocean reservoir of nitrous
oxide have been neglected here in the consideration of the
above lifetime. An ocean reservoir could potentially
extend the response time for N,O beyond the above
estimate,

The streneths of these sinks is summarised in Table 2.4.
"	Text
"Analysis of available global nitrous oxide data indicates a
clear continuous increase in N,O since the pre-industrial
era. The rate of growth over the last decade is small, about
0.25%/yr, and there is difficulty in measuring the global
abundance of N,O with this precision. For example, the
decadal trend from Prinn et al. (1990) is 0.7 to 1.0 ppbv/yr
and that from Khalil and Rasmussen (1992) is 0,5 to 1.2
ppbv/yr. In another recent analysis, Weiss (1994) showed
that the global average abundance at the beginning of 1976
was 299 ppbv and had risen to 310 ppbv at the beginning
of 1993. During 1976-82 the growth rate was about 0.55
ppbv/yr, which increased to a maximum of 0.8 ppbv/yr in
1988-89, declining to the current rate of 0.6 ppbv/yr. A
similar result has been observed in the 15-year global
record of NOAA-CMDL (Elkins et a/., 1993a, see Figure
2.4). Zander et al. (1994) have extended atmospheric
measurements of N,O from solar spectra collected at
Jungfraujoch, and derived a mixing ratio of 275 ppbv for
April 1951 together with an increase of about 10% over
the past four decades.

"2.5 Halocarbons

Perhalocarbon species such as the CFCs, carbon
tetrachloride (CCl,), carbon tetrafluoride (CF,) and the
halons are powerful greenhouse gases, because they
strongly absorb terrestrial infrared radiation and have long
(typically = S50 years) atmospheric lifetimes. The
hydrohalogenated species such as methylchloroform,
HCFCs and CFCs are also significant infrared absorbers
but their shorter atmospheric lifetimes (typically s 15
years) reduce their climatic impact compared to the
perhalocarbon species. All species containing chlorine and
bromine play a role in lower stratospheric ozone depletion,
and hence climate cooling, and this tends to offset their
ability to cause surface warming. The emissions of the
major anthropogenic chlorine- and bromine-containing
species are now largely controlled (> 90%) by the
requirements of the Montreal Protocol. A recent,
comprehensive review (Kaye et al., 1994) has provided
extensive details on the global distributions, trends,
emissions and lifetimes of halocarbons such as CFCs,
halons and related species. This section provides a
summary and update of that review.

There are a number of other short-lived chlorinated species
such as methylchloride, chloroform, dichloromethane and
chlorinated ethenes that are present in the background
atmosphere. Their atmospheric lifetimes are short and they
do not make a significant contribution to radiative forcing,
but methylchloride is a significant source of stratospheric
chlorine. Available data on the abundance of these species
have been reviewed (Fraser et al., 1994), Global mean
methylchloride (CH;Cl, 600-640 pptv), chloroform

tetrachlorethylene (CCI,CCI,, 10 pptv) and trichloro-
ethylene (CHCICCI,, 2-3 pptv) abundances are indicated.
No long-term trends for these species have been observed,
although they all exhibit distinct annual cycles (summer
minimum, winter maximum). Measurements made in 1989
in the Atlantic (45°N-30°S) showed average
methylchloride levels of 540 pptv, with slightly higher
fevels in the SH (550 + 12 pptv) than the NH (532 + 8
pptv). Significant gradients in dichloromethane (366 pptv,
NH; 18 + | pptv, SH), tetrachlorethylene(1-10 pptv, NH;
1-3 pptv, SH) and trichloroethylene (1-15 pptv, NH; <
lpptv SH) were observed consistent with anthropogenic,
largely Northern Hemispheric, sources for these species
(Koppmann et al., 1993). More recent measurements
(1990) in the tropical Pacific Ocean (15°N to 10°S) showed
that the average methylchloride level was 630 pptv;
chloroform, 9 pptv; dichloromethane, 24 pptv; and
tetrachlorethylene, 5 pptv. The methylchloride data
showed no interhemispheric gradient, indicative of a
largely oceanic source, whereas the other species showed
clear gradients (higher in the Northern Hemisphere),
indicative of Northern Hemispheric (presumably
anthropogenic) sources (Atlas et al., 1993).

Total emissions of methylbromide have been estimated
between 0.075 and 0.12 Tg/yr (Albritton and Watson,

identity of the sources is still in question. The ocean is
believed to contribute between 30-70% of atmospheric
methylbromide (Khalil et a/., 1993b; Reeves and Penkett,
1993; Singh er a/., 1983) and anthropogenic uses, such as
fumigation of soils and fresh produce, are believed to

bromoform and mixed halogens, are emitted mainly from
coastal waters, but they do not accumulate significantly in
the atmosphere. CHBr,, CHBr,Cl and CH,Br, are

However, some of these gases also react with sea water.
About 5-10% of the methylchloroform in the atmosphere
is lost to the ocean, presumably by hydrolysis (Butler er
al., 1991; Wallace et al., 1994). Only about 2% of
atmospheric HCFC-22 is apparently destroyed in the
ocean, mainly in tropical surface waters (Lobert et al.,
1993). Although the ocean is probably a net source of
methyl bromide, it is removed from sea water at about 10-
40% per day by hydrogen and halide exchange (Swain and
Scott, 1953; Mabey and Mill, 1978; Elliot, 1984; Elliot and
Rowland, 1993; Gentile et al., 1989). The lifetime of
methyl bromide with respect to tropospheric OH is about 2
yr, but the total lifetime may be significantly less. Butler
(1994) estimated an effective lifetime of 1.2 yr with
respect to increased or decreased emissions, owing to the
role of the ocean as a “buffer” for atmospheric methyl
bromide. Other, presently unquantified, land-based sinks
may also contribute to a shorter atmospheric lifetime of
methyl bromide (Rasche et al., 1990; Oremland et al.,

For some time it has been realised that stratospheric ozone
levels over northern mid-latitudes (30°-60°N, where most
of the ground-based Dobson spectrophotometers which
monitor ozone are) have decreased since around 1970
(WMO, 1990). The losses are greatest in winter and
spring. Satellite measurements from November 1979 to
March 1991 confirmed this finding and showed that
broadly similar mid-latitude losses have also occurred at
equivalent latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. Globally,
the most obvious feature is the annual appearance of the
Antarctic ozone hole in September and October. The
October average values are 50-70% lower than those
observed in the 1960s. The ozone loss occurs at altitudes
between 14 and 20 km and is clearly caused by the
chlorine and bromine compounds released in the
stratospheric decomposition of halocarbons (principally
CFCs, halons and methylbromide). The weight of evidence
shows that the mid-latitude ozone loss is due largely to the
same chlorine and bromine compounds. These results and
the effect of more recent data are assessed in the 1994
Ozone Assessment.

"	Text
"shown in Figure 2.7. The first point to note is that SBUV
shows a larger ozone decline, by about 2%/decade, than is
shown by the Dobson network. The best agreement occurs
in northern mid-latitudes where the Dobson network is
strongest. The reason for this difference is being
investigated. Overall the confidence in the trends from the
ground based network is high, although the observed
decreases in sulphur dioxide over Europe since the 1960s
may have induced overestimates in the ozone decreases at
polluted locations (De Muer and De Backer, 1992). The
second point is that by continuing the analysis into 1994,
the effect of the low ozone values in 1992-93 on the
calculated trend is small and is largest in northern mid-
latitudes where the largest ozone anomalies were observed.
The ozone decreases, both long-term and in 1992-93, have
occurred in the lower stratosphere at altitudes between
about 15 and 25 km (e.g., London and Liu, 1992; Kerr et
al. 1993; Hofmann et al., 1993, 1994a; Logan, 1994).
There is some disagreement between instrument types as
to the magnitude of the changes at these altitudes, but at
northern mid-latitudes the observed trends are in the range
-5 to -15%/decade.

The state of knowledge regarding ozone trends in the
troposphere, especially in the free troposphere, is not as
good as in the stratosphere. There are a limited number of
ozone sonde stations with records suitable for long-term
trend analysis, and even at these sites a number of
questions about the data quality remain. The stations are
mainly in the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, N. America
and Japan. Even in these regions the data are somewhat
sparse (particularly in Japan) so there is a fair degree of
uncertainty involved in reaching conclusions. Elsewhere
around the globe, especially in the tropics and Southern

An updated analysis of the ground-based total ozone
measurements through 199! shows that the mid-latitude
trends in the 1980s were significantly larger than those in
the 1970s. This acceleration is consistent with the
increasing halogen levels in the stratosphere and to the
non-linearity between ozone loss and halogen levels. The
total amount of organic chlorine in the troposphere
increased by 1.6% in 1992, about half the rate of increase
(2.9%) in 1989, Peak total of chlorine/bromine loading in
the troposphere is expected to occur in 1994 and the
stratospheric peak will lag by about 3 to 5 years. Thus in
the next few years, stratospheric halogen amounts are
expected to start to decline. In the interim, total ozone
amounts should stop decreasing and then begin a recovery
to pre-1970 values if future halocarbon emissions are
controlled as prescribed in the current Montreal Protocol.
This recovery will take place over decades, determined by
the lifetimes of the CFCs,

The reasons for the anomalous behaviour in ozone in the
last three years are not known exactly, although a number
of mechanisms have been suggested. One probable major
influence was the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in the
Philippines in June 1991 which injected large amounts of
gascous SO, into the stratosphere which was then
chemically transformed into sulphuric acid droplets
(aerosols). A thirtyfold increase in the surface area of
stratospheric aerosols was observed. The presence of
acrosols in the stratosphere can change local heating rates
which in turn affect the atmospheric dynamics and ozone
distribution. For instance, tropical stratospheric
temperatures rose in the second half of 1991, with
maximum increases of 2-3°C at 30-50 hPa (Labitske and
McCormick, 1992). At the same time negative ozone
anomalies (about 6% of background values) were observed
(Chandra, 1992; Schoeberl et al., 1992). The presence of
acrosols also affects the chemical balance by providing
surfaces on which chemical reactions involving chlorine
and bromine compounds can proceed, an effect which is
enhanced at lower temperatures. The increased altitude
range of springtime ozone depletion over Antarctica in
1992 and 1993 may be related to the presence of aerosol at
these altitudes (Hofmann e¢ al., 1994b).

The apparent regional differences in the tropospheric
ozone trends are not fully understood. As discussed
elsewhere in this chapter, NO, and NMHC amounts vary
substantially through the troposphere, and their emissions
have changed both temporally and regionally. Numerical
simulation of tropospheric O3, both global distribution and
trends over the past century, is a research task for the three-
dimensional chemical transport models (see Section 2.9).

"Although of little direct impact on the tropospheric

effect owing to their importance in tropospheric chemistry.
There, the role of NO, is that of a catalyst promoting the
formation of O, and controlling the concentration of OH,
the most important oxidising agent of the troposphere (see
Section 2.2), Through OH, emissions,of NO, influence the
adjustment times and thus the abundances of many

It is noted that the estimates of NO, sources in Table 2.5
are the means of a range. In the cases of fossil fuel
combustion, aircraft emissions and stratospheric input,
ranges may be as narrow as +30%; but in the case of
natural sources, these are a factor of 2. NO, produced by
lightning is probably the most important natural source in
the free troposphere and has an even larger uncertainty.
Geographical distributions and seasonal variations of these
emissions have been published and are needed to model
properly the atmospheric distribution of NO, (Penner et
al., 1991; Kasibhatala, 1993).

An important chemical coupling that affects the lifetimes
of CO, CH,, NMHC, HFCs and HCFCs is the change of
solar UV radiation reaching the troposphere due to
changes in stratospheric ozone column density, and
tropospheric ozone (Liu and Trainer, 1988; Briihl and
Crutzen, 1989; Fuglestvedt et a/., 1994). Reductions in
stratospheric ozone as observed since the late 1970s have
been observed to lead to enhanced penetration of UV
radiation into the troposphere (Smith et al., 1992; Kerr and
McElroy, 1993) that in turn will yicld increased production
of OD) and OH. Tropospheric UV can also be altered on
tegional or local scales by changes in reflecting cloud
cover, absorption by tropospheric O3, or back-scattering by
anthropogenic sulphate aerosols (Liu et al., 1991).
Increased tropospheric UV will feed back into the
abundances of CO and hydrogen-containing trace gases by
increasing their sinks. In addition it will speed up the
reactions that both create and destroy tropospheric ozone
(see Section 2.2), which, depending on the NO, abundance
(Fuglestvedt et al., 1994), could lead to a net decrease or a
net increase in tropospheric ozone.

"The major sources of tropospheric NO, are summarised in
Table 2.5. Fossil fuel combustion in the stationary power
and transport sectors is the largest source of NO,.
Although emissions from fossil fuel use over North
America and Europe, 6 Tg(N)/yr and 7.3 Tg(N)/yr
respectively, still constitute the largest regional sources,
they have hardly increased since 1979 owing to a levelling
off in fuel consumption and to air quality abatement
measures. The emissions over Asia, however, are
continuing to increase at a rate of 4%/yr, reaching 4.7
Tg(N)/yr in 1987 with an estimated emission of 5.7
Tg(N)/yr in 1991 (Kato and Akimoto, 1992). According to
Hameed and Dignon (1991) the global emissions from
fossil fuel combustion increased from 18.1 Tg(N)/yr in
1970 to 24.3 Tg(N)/yr in 1986. Emissions from aircraft
engines are listed separately from other fossil fuel sources
because they are released predominantly in the free
troposphere at cruise altitudes (8-12 km) rather than at the
surface and are currently increasing at a mean rate of
4%/yr (Baughcum ef al., 1993). Although only a small
fraction of the total combustion source, they are potentially
responsible for a large fraction of the NO, found at those
altitudes at northern mid-latitudes (Ehhalt er a/., 1992).
Microbial activity in soils also gives continental sources
for NO (e.g., Sanhueza, 1992; Williams e¢ al., 1992).

Atmospheric oxidation of NO, to HNO, by OH in the
daytime and to NO, by O; at night are the most important
removal processes of NO, from the troposphere. Dry
deposition of NO, plays a lesser, but still significant, role.
Some fraction of the NO, so lost is regenerated from
HNO, or NO, in the free troposphere by photo-
dissociation. The tropospheric lifetime of NO, is short and
variable. It varies with altitude, for example, from less than
a day in the boundary layer to about a week at the

High mixing ratios of NO (300 to 500 pptv) in the upper
troposphere, observed for instance during both STRATOZ

stratospheric input (Ehhalt et a/., 1992). Possible sources
are: NO produced by lightning, aircraft emissions, and fast
upward transport from a polluted boundary layer. There
are a number of observations, where the vertical NO
profile is strongly and unequivocally influenced by one or
the other of these sources, e.g., lightning (Dickerson et al.,

The most important removal mechanism for CO is
reaction with OH radicals. Soil uptake and stratospheric
removal are minor sinks of CO (WMO, 1986), In
principle, the atmospheric removal rate for CO can be
calculated from its observed distribution, the modelled
distribution of OH, and the corresponding reaction rate
coefficients. Based on measured CO distributions and an
OH-field from model calculations, a removal rate of 2020
Tg(CO//yr has been obtained. Studies of '4CO indicate
that OH levels in the Southern Hemisphere are
significantly higher than in the Northern Hemisphere
(Brenninkmeijer ef a/., 1992) and that global CO sinks
may be larger than indicated in Table 2.6 (Mak et ai.,
1992). However, simulations of CH,CCl, (c.g.
Spivakovsky et a/., 1990) do not require hemispheric
differences in OH and place tight bounds on the CO sink

that test the approximations made in modelling chemical
rates for O, production and loss. Both of these studies
were initiated as blind intercomparisons, with model
groups submitting results before sceing those of others. In
the transport study, no obvious mistakes in performing the
case studies were found, and detailed results will be
published as a workshop report. In the photochemical
study, some obvious errors in the set-up, diagnosis, or
model formulation were identified and resubmitted by the
contributors as discussed below. Both provide a first look
at the consistency among current models. Participation in
these {wo intercomparisons was a prerequisite for the use
of any model's results in a third study (Section 2.10.2),
which examines the chemical perturbations caused by CH,
increases and provides the basis for calculating the indirect
GWP of CH, in Chapter 5.

transporting tracers predominantly by diffusion, and they

have chemical time-scales comparable to the rate of

tropopause. Compared with the synoptic models, it is
obvious that the monthly averaged models simulate the
transport of surface-emitted NO, into the free troposphere
very differently, which may lead to inaccurate estimation
of total NO, concentrations. The 2-D models appear to
have a clear systematic bias favouring high-altitude
sources (¢.g., stratosphere and aircraft) over surface
sources (¢.g., combustion) and may calculate a very

All of the established CTMs produced patterns and

in concentration of more than 100. As an example, the
zonal mean radon from case (i) for December, January and
February is shown for the ECHAM3 and CCM2 models in
Figure 2.12a-b. The two toothlike structures result from
the major tropical convergence and convective uplift south
of the equator and the uplift over the Sahara in the north.
This basic pattern is reproduced by all the other synoptic
CTMs. In June, July and August (not shown) the 5 x 10°?!

models produce similar patterns. In contrast, the 2-D
model results, shown for the AER model in Figure 2.12c,
have much smoother latitudinal structures, fail to match
the expected zonally averaged concentrations, do not show
the same seasonality, and, of course, cannot predict the
large longitudinal gradients expected for 22*Rn (similar
arguments hold for NO,, see Kanakidou and Crutzen,
1993). Results from the Moguntia CTM (monthly average
3-D winds) fell in between these two extremes and could
not represent the structures and variations predicted by the

The photochemical evolution of NO, and O, in a parcel of
tropospheric air is as important as the transport in the CTM
simulations of ozone. We need to evaluate the chemistry in
these models separately. Unfortunately, there is no easy
observational test of the rapid photochemistry of the
troposphere that includes the net chemical tendency of O3.
Furthermore, uncertainties in the kinetic parameters would
probably encompass a wide range of observations. Thus,
we chose an engineering test in which all chemical
mechanisms and data, along with the atmospheric
conditions, were specified exactly in each case. This
comparison becomes then a test of the photochemical
schemes used by the different groups, and in general there
is only one correct answer. For most of these results, many
models give similar answers, resulting in a “band” of
consensus, which we assume here to be the best answer.
We are thus testing the consistency of the numerical
solution of the photochemical reaction system under highly
constrained conditions.

The photolysis of O, yielding OCD) (reaction (2.1)) is
the first critical step in generating OH, and it controls the
net production of O,. In this case tropospheric values peak
at about 4-8 km because of molecular scattering. Model
predictions for this photolysis rate at noon, shown in
Figure 2.13a, fall within a band, +20% of the mean value,
if a few outliers are not considered. These differences are
still large considering that all models purport to be making
the same calculation. This photolysis of O, and subsequent
reaction with H,O (reaction (2.2)) drives the major loss of
O; in MARINE (0 km, 10 pptv NO,) as shown in Figure
2.13b. The spread in results after 5 days, 21 to 23 ppbv, or

parcels with specified initial conditions were allowed to
evolve in isolation for five days with diurnally varying
photolysis rates (“J”s). The PhotoComp cases were
selected as examples of different chemical environments in
the troposphere. The wet boundary layer is the most
extensive, chemically active region of the troposphere.
Representative conditions for the low-NO, concentrations
over oceans (case: MARINE) and the high-NO,
concentrations over continents (case: LAND) were picked.
In MARINE, ozone is lost rapidly (-1.4 ppbv/day), but in
LAND the initial NO, boosts Oj levels. Over the
continental boundary layer NO, loss is rapid, and the high
NO, levels must be maintained by local emissions (c.g.,
Zhou et al., 1993). This region has the potential for export
of O, (and its precursors) to the free troposphere
(Pickering et al., 1992; Jacob et al., 1993). Rapid O,
formation has been observed to occur in biomass burning
plumes, and the rate is predicted to depend critically on
whether hydrocarbons are present (PLUME/HC) or not
(PLUME). In the dry upper troposphere (FREE), O,
evolves very slowly, less than 1%/day, even at NO, levels

The original specifications for the comparison of
photochemical schemes (PhotoComp) and the follow-on
evaluation of CH,’s impact on global chemistry (delta-
CH,) brought results from a wide variety of research
groups listed in Table 2.8. Twenty-three model groups
submitted to PhotoComp, and seven groups to the delta-
CH, study. Assessment of the initial results revealed
numerous mistakes. Most of these obvious discrepancies
occurred in model formulation, interpretation of
instructions, or reporting of results. Assessment of
tropospheric chemistry lacks experience when compared
with that of stratospheric ozone, and one purpose in having
such a blind intercomparison was to provide a measure of
potential model discrepancies. (For more typical
assessments such as the delta-CHy study, there remain so
many options in these complex calculations that
differences can be easily ascribed to many “justified”
causes.) If these mode] assessments had been frozen in
January 1994 as originally planned, then there would have
been only two model results for the delta~-CH, scenario.
Therefore, the model intercomparison / assessment was
continued with resubmissions up to June 1994. The current
list of contributions is the same as for the parallel WMO
Ozone Assessment. Removal or correction of obvious
errors did not eliminate discrepancies among the models.
and significant differences still remain and are presented

Few of the above studies of pre-industrial atmospheres
can be compared directly because of the diversity in
boundary conditions used. While most calculations will
use similar boundary conditions for the long-lived gases
(CH, and N,O) based on the ice core record, the historical
records of CO, NO, and NMHC emissions are unknown.
Furthermore, many of these models are solely tropospheric
and do not include photochemical coupling with the
stratosphere, and the stratospheric influxes of O, and NO,
are prescribed. Since the documented changes in CH, and
N,O are substantial, it is likely that stratospheric ozone has
evolved. Thus CTMs simulating tropospheric O, must
include the interactions with an evolving stratosphere. A
final warning must be that these models cannot predict the
possible changes in the circulation over the last centuries.

The impact of methane perturbations are felt throughout all
of atmospheric chemistry from the surface to the
exosphere, and most of these mechanisms are well
understood. Quantification of these effects, however, is
one of the classic problems in modelling atmospheric
chemistry. Similar to the ozone studies noted above, the
published methane-change studies have examined
scenarios that range from 700 ppbv (pre-industrial) to 1700
ppbv (current) to a doubling by the year 2050 (e.g., WMO,
1992), but these scenarios are not consistent across
models. The study of the effects of an increase in methane
concentrations (delta~-CH,) was designed to provide a
common framework for evaluating the multitude of
indirect effects, especially changes in O, and OH, that are
associated with an increase in CH, (see Section 2.2.6) and
that provide the basis for the quantitative evaluation of
radiative forcing from today’s CH, emissions. The study

Methane is the only long-lived gas that has clearly
identified, important chemical feedbacks: increases in
atmospheric CH, reduce tropospheric OH, increase the
CH, lifetime, and hence amplify the climatic and chemical
impacts of a CH, perturbation (Isaksen and Hov, 1987).
The delta~-CH, simulations from six different 2-D and 3-D
models show that these chemical feedbacks change the
telative loss rate for CH, by -0.17% to -0.35% for each 1%
increase in CH, concentration as shown in Table 2.9. This
range reflects differences in the modelled roles of CH,,
CO, and NMHC as sinks for OH. For example, model M,
with the smallest feedback factor, has fixed the
concentrations of CO; and model R has shown that
calculating CO instead with a flux boundary condition (as
most of the other models have done) results in a larger
feedback. These differences cannot be resolved with this
intercomparison, and this range underestimates our
uncertainty in this factor.

the global OH levels by a similar amount (ic, -0.3%6 per

increase in the already existing atmospheric reservoir of
CHy, which cannot be distinguished from a longer
adjustment time for the initial pulse. Thus the adjustment
time (AT) is longer than the lifetime (LT) derived from the
budget (i.e., total abundance divided by total losses).
Prather (1994) has shown that the ratio, AT/LT, is equal to
1/(1 + FF) and that this adjustment time applies to all CH,
perturbations, positive or negative, no matter how small or
large, as long as the change in CH, concentration is not
large enough to change the feedback factor. Based on
model results, this assumption should apply at least over a
+30% change in current CH, concentrations. Two of the
models with results in Table 2.9 have shown that small
CH, perturbations decay with the predicted adjustment

"Based on these limited results, we choose 1.45 as the
best estimate for the ratio AT/LT, with an uncertainty
bracket of 1.20 to 1.70. The budget lifetime of CH, is
calculated to be about 10 yr, using the CH,CCI, lifetime as
a standard for OH and including stratospheric losses, and
gives a best estimate for the CH, adjustment time of 14.5 +
2.5 yr. If the biological soil sink were to respond to the
atmosphere in the same way as the chemical sink, this
would reduce the adjustment time to a little under 14 yr. In
this chapter we use the range 14 + 3 (11-17) yr to cover
this uncertainty. This enhanced time-scale describes the
effective duration for all current emissions of CH,; it is
independent of other emissions as long as current
concentrations of CHy, +30%, are maintained. In the
extreme case that all CH, emissions (including natural
sources) ceased, the initial rate of decay (1/9.4 /yr) would
become more rapid as OH levels increased, resulting in
increasingly rapid decay, with an average adjustment time
of about 8.5 yr. However, a small additional pulse on top
of this decaying profile still produces chemical feedbacks
that lengthen its adjustment time to 10.1 yr, a factor of 1.2
longer than the bulk of the CH,.

The major sources of m most of the gases discussed in this
section are at the Earth’s surface. However some of the
gases discussed in this chapter are predominantly formed
in the atmosphere. Two of these are of particular
importance: O, and CO. O, is formed exclusively through
photochemical processes in the atmosphere, and its
concentration is strongly influenced by chemicals of
anthropogenic origin (e.g., halocarbons in the stratosphere,
NO, and hydrocarbons in the troposphere). A major source
of CO is the oxidation of methane and other hydrocarbons
in the troposphere. The link between surface emissions of
NMHC and CO production in the atmosphere is more
quantitatively established than the corresponding link
between NO, and NMHC emissions and the production of
tropospheric ozone, although the mechanisms for both are
well known.

The atmospheric abundance of a chemical species is
governed by the rates of production and removal, where
these terms include processes occurring at the Earth’s
surface (emission and deposition) and in the atmosphere
(chemical). When the gross production/emission rate is
equal to the gross removal rate, the atmospheric
concentration is in steady state and therefore remains
constant over time. In practice, it is more straightforward
to quantify the net change in atmospheric abundance (by
direct measurement of the atmospheric concentration),
than to estimate either of the gross terms with any
accuracy. As discussed earlier in this chapter, a number of
atmospheric feedback processes are known which have the
potential to change atmospheric turn-over times (the
temoval rate), principally through perturbation of the
tropospheric hydroxyl radical concentrations. How well
current models of the atmosphere can quantify the effects
of these feedbacks is unclear, and so in this discussion it is
assumed (with the exception of CH, where the adjustment
time is used) that the atmospheric lifetimes of the various
gases remains constant.

"Very crudely, each reduction in emissions of 37 Tg/yr
would lower the atmospheric concentration at stabilisation

each increase of 37 Tg/yr would raise the atmospheric
concentration at stabilisation by about 170 ppbv.) It must
be emphasised that these estimates should only be used as
a guide because it is assumed that other changes in
atmospheric chemistry that control the CH, adjustment
time are not changing over this period.

"In most of the troposphere, the rate-limiting precursor of
new ozone production is NO,, although NMHCs play an
important role in some regions. Accordingly,
recommendations to stabilise tropospheric ozone focus on
controlling emissions of NO,. However, as shown in
Section 2.10.2, some control of CH, (and CO and NMHC)
is also necessary. The lifetime of ozone is very short (2-4
weeks), and so the effects of any reductions in precursor
emissions should be felt quickly.
"	Text
"   

How to control these precursors, particularly NO, and
NMHC, is extremely difficult to assess, because their
impact on tropospheric O, cannot be calculated by just
summing their global emissions. The effect of these short-
lived species depends on where and when they are emitted,
as evidenced by the fact that aircraft emissions of NO,
have a proportionately greater impact than equal surface
emissions on O, in the upper troposphere. Both this
relative impact and the absolute source (i.e., anthropogenic
surface emissions of NO, are about 80 times those from
aircraft) must be combined when assessing the role of
short-lived species on radiative forcing.

The atmospheric N,O abundance has, on average,
increased by about 3.9 Tg(N)/yr (0.25%/yr) over the last
10-15 years. The anthropogenic emissions are estimated to
be about 5.7 Tg(N)/yr, so a cut of about two-thirds of the
anthropogenic emissions is needed to stabilise N,O
concentration at today’s value. However, if the
anthropogenic emissions were held constant at current
values, the atmospheric N,O abundance would climb from
310 ppbv to about 400 ppbv. The relatively long lifetime
of N,O (120 years) means that this change would be slow
with the N,O abundance reaching 370 ppbv by the year
2100. Further, any reductions in the atmospheric N,O
abundance would take a hundred years or so.

Stratospheric ozone decreases over the last 25 years have
occurred principally from the use of CFCs and halons.
Future production of these and other ozone-depleting
substances is limited under the Montreal Protocol.
Depletion of stratospheric ozone is predicted to peak in the
next decade, and ozone levels are expected to recover as
the concentrations of these compounds fall, which will
take several decades. Recovery of the Antarctic ozone hole
is not expected untif the middle of the 21st century. CFCs,
halons and related compounds are not the only
anthropogenic influences and other perturbations (NO,
from N,O, changes in stratospheric temperatures from
increased radiative forcing, etc.) will also influence future
stratospheric ozone levels.

"Nearly all CFCs and other industrial halocarbons are out of
balance in that emissions exceed atmospheric losses. For
short-lived halocarbons such as CH,CCl, with stable
emissions over the past several years, the compound is
nearly in steady-state, and the reduction in emissions
expected under the Montreal Protocol would first stabilise,
and then reduce atmospheric concentrations. For longer-
lived compounds (CFCs), the primary production allowed
under Article 5 of the Protocol and the continued release of
the bank of current CFCs may sustain concentrations of the
longer-lived CFCs over over the next decade or so.
Overall, total tropospheric chlorine levels in the form of
industrial halocarbons should peak in the next few years.
In the longer term, atmospheric abundances will fall, the
speed of decline depending on the adjustment time of the

particular compound.

"Large volcanic eruptions, such as Mt. Pinatubo,
significantly influence the aerosol in the stratosphere
and the effects persist over several years.
Stratospheric aerosol has a longer lifetime (of order
1 year) than aerosol] in the troposphere and is
therefore more uniformly distributed. The amount of
sunlight reflected by aerosols over industrial regions
is comparable with the peak effects of volcanic
aerosols.
"	List
"There are many lines of evidence suggesting that
anthropogenic acroso] has increased the optical
depth over and downwind of industrial regions and
that this increase is very large compared with the
natural background in these regions.

The major contributions to the anthropogenic
component of the aerosol optical depth arise from
sulphates (produced from sulphur dioxide released as
a result of fossil fuel combustion) and from organics
released by biomass burning.
"	List
" 

The impact of aerosol on the optical properties of
low level clouds has been demonstrated in localised
observations but the global impact has yet to be
quantified. The effect is expected to be smaller for
additional aerosol introduced into already polluted
air,

There is some observational evidence suggesting that
mean sizes of cloud droplets are larger in the
Southern Hemisphere (where tropospheric acrosol
concentration is generally lower) than in the
Northern Hemisphere (where aerosol concentration
is generally higher).
"	List
"Atmospheric aerosol in the troposphere influences

climate in two ways, directly through the reflection

and absorption of solar radiation, and indirectly
through modifying the optical properties and lifetime
of clouds.

Estimation of aerosol radiative forcing is more

complex and hence more uncertain than radiative

forcing due to the well-mixed greenhouse gases (see

Chapter 4) for several reasons:

@) Both the direct and indirect radiative effect of
aerosol particles are strongly dependent on
particle size and chemical composition and
cannot be related to aerosol mass source
strengths in a simple manner.

(ii) The indirect radiative effect of aerosols
depends on complex processes involving
aerosol particles and the nucleation and growth
of cloud droplets.

(iii) Aerosols in the troposphere have short
lifetimes (around a week) and therefore their
spatial distribution is highly inhomogeneous
and strongly correlated with their sources.

The net (direct and indirect) global mean radiative

forcing due to the increase in anthropogenic aerosol

since pre-industrial times is negative and the
magnitude is significant; while forcing due to
changes in sulphate and organic aerosols is negative,
that due to soot carbon is probably positive although
present estimates suggest the latter is relatively small
(see Chapter 4 for more details).

there is sound physical and chemical evidence

as well as their spatial and temporal distribution.
"	List
"(i)

The aerosol mass and size distribution show
considerable temporal and spatial variability due to
the relatively short lifetime and localised nature of
the sources and sinks. There are substantial
differences in the distributions of both anthropogenic
and natural aerosols between the Northern and
Southern Hemispheres owing to the different
anthropogenic sources and different distribution of
land masses.
"	List
"Aerosols in general, and anthropogenic aerosols in
particular, are thought to exert a radiative influence on
climate directly, through the reflection and absorption of
solar radiation, and indirectly, through modifying the
optical properties and lifetimes of clouds. The atmospheric
loading of anthropogenic aerosols and the resultant
radiative influence have increased over the industrial
period roughly in parallel with that of the greenhouse gases
and these aerosol particles could have exerted a significant
radiative forcing over this period.
"	Text
"   

In contrast to greenhouse gases, atmospheric acrosol
particles are short-lived in the troposphere with lifetimes
of around a week , while they have lifetimes of a year or
more in the stratosphere. The short lifetimes, together with
the highly non-uniform geographical distribution of
aerosol sources, results in a highly non-uniform
geographical distribution of anthropogenic aerosols. This
non-uniformity results in very different patterns of
radiative forcing and may result in different climate
response patterns compared with greenhouse gases which
are well-mixed.

"Aerosols present a large source of uncertainty in
calculating radiative forcing over the industrial period. The
effect of anthropogenic aerosol may help explain the
differences between observed climate change over the
industrial era and the best estimates of such change from
model calculations which are based only on the effects of
greenhouse gases. However, at the present time, the
climatic effects of aerosols can only be estimated with
considerable uncertainty (+Hansen ef al., 1990) due to the
lack of sufficient detailed observations. A quantitative
estimate of the uncertainty can be made only for direct
forcing by sulphate and organic aerosols; other aerosol
types, e.g., soil dust and soot, cannot yet be quantified.

DO
Atmospheric aerosol particles are conventionally defined
as those particles suspended in air having diameters in the
range 10-3 to 10 wm.! They are formed by the reaction of
gases in the atmosphere (gas to particle conversion), or by
the dispersal of material at the surface. Although forming a
small part of the mass of the atmosphere, around 1 part in
10°, they have the potential significantly to influence both
radiative transfer through the atmosphere and the
atmospheric water cycle. The best understood mechanism
by which aerosol particles can influence climate is by
scattering incoming solar radiation, thereby increasing the
Earth’s albedo (the direct effect). Absorption of solar
radiation, for example by soot, may cool the surface while
heating the atmosphere. Direct aerosol forcing is primarily

 
"	Text
"a short-wave forcing process, and is therefore expected to
dominate in the daytime and summer months (¢.g., Karl ef
al, 1991; Engardt and Rodhe, 1992; Hunter ef al., 1993).
Although acrosol particles may absorb long-wave
radiation, this effect is believed to be small for
anthropogenic aerosols other than soot. Anthropogenic
aerosol particles acting as cloud condensation nuclei
(CCN) are believed to increase the number concentration
of cloud droplets, increasing cloud albedo (the indirect
effect) e.g., SMIC, 1971; Twomey, 1977; Twomey et al.,
1984, The corresponding decrease in cloud droplet size
may inhibit precipitation formation, extending cloud
lifetime. Long-wave absorption by wet aerosol particles
(Marley ef a/., 1993) may be a significant factor in the
overall radiation balance but estimates of the magnitude of
this effect are only preliminary.

their geographical distribution is highly non-uniform. As a
consequence, the relative importance of the various

industrialised regions in Europe and North America the
industrial sources are relatively much more important. The

Aerosols are not chemically homogeneous and are
produced by a variety of processes including
chemical reactions between gases in the air. Such
heterogeneity makes it difficult to prescribe particle
size distributions and optical properties of given
types of aerosol particles, for example in climate
models.

The radiative effects of aerosol are critically
dependent on the size distribution, rather than simply
on the total mass loading alone. Different sources
have different aerosol size characteristics and the
size distribution and chemical composition change as
the aerosol ages.

"Atmospheric mineral dust is found all around the globe.
This is due to long-range transport over thousands of
kilometres within the general circulation of the
atmosphere. Major sources of the particulate matter are the
arid and semi-arid regions, where the material is
continuously produced by bulk to particle conversion
caused by physical and chemical weathering of soils and
rock. The diameter of windblown soil dust ranges from
less than 1 wm to 100 wm or more. The largest particles fall
out rapidly and are of no concern in this context. The mass
median diameter of that fraction which is transported ove;
appreciable distances (several 100 km) is about 2-4 jm

Table 3.1 (modified from Andreae, 1995) summarises
the estimated annual emissions into the troposphere or
stratosphere from the major sources of atmospheric
aerosol. Emission of mineral aerosols from soil dust has
been classified as a natural source, although a certain
influence from anthropogenic processes, ¢.g., agriculture,
is likely to exist. Likewise, biomass burning is not purely
anthropogenic. The large upper estimates for sea salt and
volcanic dust include large particles with very short
atmospheric lifetimes. It should be noted that particle mass
flux is not a good measure of either the mass loading or the
instantaneous effect of the aerosol particles, for reasons to
be discussed later. Further, the quantities shown are highly
disparate in magnitude and uncertainty so that the totals
are only intended to demonstrate that anthropogenic
aerosols are a significant contribution to the total aerosol
burden.

Biomass burning is likely to be the next largest source of
fine mode anthropogenic aerosols, after sulphate (Andreae,
1991). Most of the precursors are carbon, sulphur and
nitrogen compounds which form organic sulphate and
nitrate aerosols. Another important component is soot and
tar condensates (Cachier et al., 1989). The types of
aerosols formed depend to a great extent on the
combustion characteristics and have not been fully
characterised (Levine, 1991).

Natural gases which are precursors of aerosol particles
include sulphur compounds (mainly dimethyl sulphide
(DMS) and SO,), hydrocarbons (HC) and oxides of
nitrogen (NO and NO,, known collectively as NO,), and
HNO3. Oxidation of these precursors occurs both in the
gas phase (mainly through oxidation processes initiated by
the OH and other atmospheric radicals) and in liquid
droplets. In this oxidation process low volatility products
are formed which either condense onto pre-existing aeroso!

Natural emissions of particulate organic carbon (POC) are
produced by marine and continental sources. Global
emissions of POC from ocean regions are estimated to be
slightly larger than from continental natural sources (Duce,
1978). Particles with nominal diameters > 1 wm account
for 90% of the POC emitted from both source categories.
The ocean is a large source of POC owing to the injection
of naturally derived marine surfactants from bubble bursting
processes (Monahan, 1986). Terrestrial sources of primary
POC include natural products emitted from vegetation such
as Cy to Cyy, terpenes, plant waxes, and macromolecular
plant fragments (Graedel 1979; Simoneit and Mazurek
1981). POC may also be emitted by combustion processes.

"Volcanic emissions consist of solid particles (ash) and

SO, is a precursor to aerosol formation by gas to particle

particle range. Most of the known active volcanoes are in
the Northern Hemisphere, and only 18% are between 10°S
and the South Pole (Simkin ef a/., 1981; Simkin and Sibert,
1984). In regions with frequent volcanic activity, the
emission of sulphur and other aerosol components may be
important (e.g., Hobbs ef a/., 1982). For example, Allard et

(SMIC, 1971; Blanchard, 1983). The mass median
diameter of sea salt aerosol near the sea surface is of the
order of 8 em and, because of their short lifetime and
inefficient light-scattering, the largest particles are of little
importance to radiative forcing of climate change.
Therefore, in Table 3.1 a value of 1,300 Tg/yr is suggested
as representative for that fraction of the sea salt acrosol
which can be transported throughout the lower marine

Primary aerosol particles originate from the incombustible
material present as inorganic impurities in the fuel which
passes through the combustion process and from
incomplete fuel combustion. The amount of aerosol
material produced from coal is much larger than from oil.
The result of more efficient particle removal systems is
that emissions from modern coal-fired installations are an
order of magnitude lower than those of a few decades ago.
However, for many developing countries the conditions
appropriate to the older installations probably apply. In
addition to combustion sources, industrial dust may be
produced by other processes. The size of the emitted
industrial dust particles depends on, among other things,
the efficiency of the filtering process. Most of the 100

Today, industrial and other anthropogenic sources of

precursor gases represent a very substantial addition to the
natural precursors (see Table 3.1). The largest contribution
comes from industrial SO,. For a few decades, this source
of gaseous sulphur has surpassed the natural emission of
such gases (mainly DMS from the oceans and SO, from
volcanoes). The current industrial SO, emission is about
70 - 90 TgS/yr (see e.g., Muller, 1992; Spiro et al., 1992),
roughly half of which is oxidised to aerosol sulphate
before being deposited (Langner and Rodhe, 1991).

regions in the Northern Hemisphere, and little of this SO,

sources of NO, include soil exhalation (about 10 TgN/yr)
(Galbally and Roy, 1978), and lightning (2-20 TgN/yr)
(Warneck, 1988). It is estimated that about half of the NO,
is oxidised to nitric acid (HNO3) which is present in both
the gas and the condensed phase (in aerosols and droplets).
Part of the gas phase HNO, is deposited directly at the
Earth’s surface or scavenged by precipitation. The fraction
of the HNO, that contributes to the aerosol mass (or
number) is uncertain. There is a tendency for the aerosol
nitrate to occur as coarse particles, which are not so

The contribution of natural non-methane hydrocarbons
(NMHC) to the aerosol mass and number concentration is
likely to be very significant, especially in coniferous
forests where emissions of terpenes and other
hydrocarbons are large. The global emission of natural
NMHC is estimated to be about 700 Tg/yr out of which
about 10% may be converted to aerosols (Andreae, 1995).
Carbonaceous aerosol particles either emitted directly from
natural and anthropogenic sources or produced from
precursor gases have highly complex chemical
compositions that contain varying proportions of elemental
and organic carbon. The scattering and absorption
characteristics depend strongly on the proportion of
elemental and organic carbon. Natural aerosols contain
essentially no elemental carbon except for smoke aerosols
from wild fires. Anthropogenic particles produced from
combustion processes contain substantial quantities of
elemental carbon relative to organic carbon, depending
on the source type (Hildemann et al., 1991; Cachier et al.,

Brownian motion becomes unimportant as particle size

particles do not readily become attached to coarse mode

accumulation mode (e.g., H,SO,) from reacting with those

The general form of size distribution in Figure 3.1

of data from both continental and marine locations.
Chemical species in the accumulation mode particles thus
must dominate the CCN concentration and, most
significantly, anthropogenic changes in it. Because
the number concentration is dominated by particles
less than about 0.1 “wm diameter, the chemical substances
in fine mode particles must dominate the process of
cloud nucleation even though the coarse mode particles
contribute more to the aerosol mass. Similarly, but

Whereas the number of aerosol particles and their surface
area can be reduced by coagulation processes within the
atmosphere, removal of aerosol mass is mainly achieved
by transfer to the Earth’s surface or by volatilisation. Such
transfer is brought about by precipitation (“wet
deposition”) and by direct uptake at the surface (“dry
deposition”). The efficiency of both these deposition
processes is strongly dependent on particle size, especially
in the diameter range 0.1-10 wm ( Slinn, 1983). For
particles in the accumulation mode, wet deposition is the
major removal process. The lifetime of nuclei mode particles

The time spent in the atmosphere by an acrosol particle
is a complex function of its physical and chemical
characteristics (e.g., size, hygroscopic properties, etc.) and
the time and location of its release. For sulphate particles
in the diameter range 0.01-1.0 am (fine mode) released or
formed in the mid-latitude boundary layer, an average
lifetime is typically of the order of several days (Junge,
1963; Rodhe, 1978; Chamberlain, 1991). This time scale is
dominated mainly by the frequency of recurrence of
precipitation. Particles transported into, or formed in the
upper troposphere are likely to have a longer lifetime
(weeks to months) because of less efficient precipitation
scavenging ( Balkanski et a/., 1993). Many estimates of
atmospheric lifetimes or aerosol particles have been based
on measurements of radio nuclides bound to aerosols; for
example Cambray ef al. (1987) estimated a lifetime of nine
days for '37Cs from the Chernobyl accident. The global
model simulation of Langner and Rodhe (1991) gave a
global average lifetime of sulphate aerosol of about five
days. It should be noted that the atmospheric lifetime of
aerosol particles in the troposphere is much smaller than
the lifetimes of the main greenhouse gases (see Chapters I,
2 and 5). The implications of this difference are discussed
further in Sections 3.8 and 3.10. Aerosol particles injected
into, or formed in, the stratosphere have lifetimes of order
one year, much longer than those of tropospheric particles.
This is largely due to the absence of precipitation
scavenging and limited vertical turbulent transport.

While a number of techniques for retrieval of aerosol
properties from satellite measurements have been
investigated, the only instruments thus far flown which
were specifically designed to provide aerosol! information
are SAGE I, SAGE II and SAM II. These experiments use
photometers to observe the solar occultation at each
satellite sunrise-sunset and thus determine the vertical
profile of aerosol extinction at 1 wm wavelength in the
stratosphere, and, in the absence of high-altitude clouds, in
the upper troposphere ( McCormick et al., 1979; Yue et
al., 1989; Kent et al., 1991). Occultation observations are a
particularly sensitive method for aerosol measurement
because of the enhanced aerosol effects with the large path
length at the limb and the self-calibrating nature of such
measurements. However, the restriction to satellite sunrise-
sunset locations leads to a sparse distribution of aerosol
profiles and restricted ability to probe the atmosphere
below about 7 km altitude although realisation of the full
potential of satellite monitoring of aerosol optical depths,
particle size shape and refractive index will depend on
concurrent monitoring of aerosol profiles from fixed
ground sites to provide calibration and to allow detailed
process studies.

Strong evidence for a large-scale increase in the
atmospheric burden of anthropogenic aerosols can also be
found in the record of atmospheric composition preserved
in glacier ice cores. In the Greenland ice sheet, non-sea salt
sulphate (and nitrate) show a pronounced increase (from
about 20 to over 100 ng/g in the case of sulphate) over the
past century (Figure 3.5; Mayewski ef al., 1986, 1990).
Similar data from Antarctica show no such increase
(Legrand and Delmas, 1987). Lead found in snow layers of
the Greenland ice sheet is a good tracer of anthropogenic

measurements of light-scattering over the North Atlantic
have shown that haze-forming aerosol particles can be
transported for great distances over the oceans and still
produce an easily detectable impact on the scattering
properties of the atmosphere (Fraser et al., 1984). Based
on aircraft measurements, Andreae er al. (1988) showed
that mid-tropospheric sulphate concentrations over the
North Pacific off the west coast of the United States were
dominated by long-range transport from Asia. In addition,
ground-based observations suggest that long-range

The increase in CCN above natural levels due to
anthropogenic emissions is well documented in
industrialised regions (Warner and Twomey, 1967; Hobbs
etal., 1970; Braham, 1974; Schmidt, 1974; Twomey er al.,
1978). That elevated sulphate levels over the North
Atlantic are correlated with an increase in CCN is
suggested by the data of Hoppel (1979), who finds that
CCN concentrations over the North Atlantic are typically
three or more times greater than over the Southern
Hemisphere oceans (Twomey er al., 1984). A pronounced
upward trend (~10%/yr) in condensation nuclei (particles
larger than 0.01 ppm) over the past eight years at a site in
Antarctica has been reported, although the cause has not
been determined and the effect on CCN concentrations is
unclear. It is possible that these changes, and small
decreases in aerosol concentration at the South Pole
(Samson er al., 1990) may reflect changing dynamical
factors. At Cape Grim, Tasmania (41°S), the only site with
an extended record, Gras (1994) reported a significant
decrease in CCN concentrations of around 3%/yr during
1981-91 while the concentration of condensation nuclei
(CN) increased by 1.2%/yr. Hobbs er al. (1970) have also
shown that ice nuclei may be transported long distances
from their sources. This demonstrates the complexity of
interactions between aerosol sources, sinks and transport
processes.

Stratospheric aerosol loading in 1979 was
approximately 0.5 Tg of sulphate, thought to be
representative of background aerosol conditions. The
present status of the aerosol is one of enhancement due to
the June 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo (15.1°N, 120.4°E),
which produced on the order of 30 Tg of new aerosol in
the stratosphere, about three times that of the 1982
eruption of El Chichon. The Mt. Pinatubo perturbation
appears to be the largest of the century, perhaps the largest
since the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa. By early 1993,
stratospheric loading had decreased to approximately 13
Tg, about equal to the peak loading values after E]
Chichon, although the aerosol optical depth associated
with the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo was comparable with
that following El Chichon due to the differing aerosol
distribution.

"Just as stratospheric aerosol is derived from substances
transported upward through the troposphere, the sink for it
is transport back into the troposphere via sedimentation,
subsidence and exchange through tropopause folds and
turbulence in the vicinity of jet streams. This flux of
acrosol material, particularly sulphates, directly into the
upper troposphere represents a substantial local source of
aerosol, The above estimate for the Mt. Pinatubo aerosol of
30 Tg SO, decaying with a half life of 6-9 months, can be
compared to estimates of the current natural non-volcanic
and anthropogenic global annual fluxes of 30 and 140 Tg
of SO; respectively. Thus, the extra flux of sulphate mass
represents a short-lived addition to the tropospheric
sulphate burden that is substantial on a global basis and
may be a major contribution at locations remote from

"3.6.2 Size Distributions, Compositions and Optical
Depths

Stratospheric aerosol sizes range from hundredths of a
micrometre to several micrometres, Although there is
some variability, especially just after a volcanic eruption,
two log normal size distributions of spherical,
submicrometre particles appears to be an apt description of
the aerosol. Just after an eruption, the previously
monomodal size distribution becomes bimodal, and some
particles are non-spherical because of the addition of
crustal material. While there are relatively few
measurements of the size distribution, the volcanically
perturbed/climatically important acrosol is currently
described as having a bimodal number distribution. The
smaller mode has a geometric mean diameter by number of
0.1 um and a concentration of 10 cm, and the larger mode
is characterised by a mean diameter of | yam, and a
concentration of 1 cm (Hofmann, 1993, personal
communication). Given this size distribution, the larger
mode accounts for almost all of the mass
optical effects. In terms of optical extinction, stratospheric
aerosols of this sort demonstrate very little light absorption
at solar wavelengths, with a scattering coefficient around
1-2 x 10° m! at 550 nm. For aerosol layers of several to
perhaps 10 km depth, this results in optical depths of 0.1 to
0.2, as indeed was observed in 1992 over much of the
globe. This is a large excursion compared with < 0.01 for
the volcanically unperturbed case. Figure 3.6 from Dutton
and Christy (1992) shows the observed optical depth at
Mauna Loa, Hawaii illustrating the magnitude and
systematic decay following both the El Chichon (1982)
and Mt. Pinatubo (1991) eruptions. As is indicated in
Chapter 4, there is evidence of significant warming of the
stratosphere following both eruptions.

as well as the

stratospheric clouds (PSCs) and clouds just above the
tropical tropopause. A background concentration of
sulphuric acid droplets also appears to be present. At
normal stratospheric temperatures, aerosols are most likely
supercooled solution droplets of H,SO,.H,O, with an acid
weight fraction of 55 to 80%. The primary source of
stratospheric aerosols is volcanic eruptions that are strong
enough to inject SO, (sometimes H,S) buoyantly into the
stratosphere. After an eruption, and following conversion
to H,SO, (gas) and subsequently to sulphuric acid
aerosols, aerosol loading decreases with a half life of 6 to 9
months, although this appears quite variable with altitude
and latitude. The decay is most likely due to a combination
of sedimentation, subsidence and exchange through
tropopause folds. The net effect of this post-volcanic
dispersion and natural cleansing is a greatly enhanced
aerosol concentration in the upper troposphere after a
major eruption, especially poleward of about 30° latitude.
Except immediately after an eruption, stratospheric aerosol
droplets tend to be concentrated into three distinct
latitudinal bands, one over the equatorial region (between
30°N and 30°S ) and the others over each high latitude region
(50° to 90°N and S). Following a low latitude eruption,
aerosol is dispersed into both hemispheres, whereas
following a mid-to-high latitude eruption, aerosols tend to
stay primarily in the hemisphere of the eruption. Potential
sources of a background aerosol component include
carbonyl sulphide from the oceans, low level SO, emissions
from volcanoes, and various anthropogenic sources,
including industrial and aircraft emissions. Measurements
of aerosols in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere
using balloon sondes, commencing in 1960 (Hofmann,
1991) suggest a 5%/year increase in non-sea-salt sulphate
that might be attributed to jet aircraft emissions. If the
concentrations increase with anticipated increases in air
traffic they could have significant climatic implications,
and furthermore water vapour from aircraft emissions may
increase the numbers of atmospheric ice particles.

Some of the models still disregard microphysical

the cloud microphysical properties.

The fact that increasing aerosol particle concentrations
can affect the microphysical and radiative properties of
clouds is seen by the formation of ship tracks in extensive
sheets of layer cloud (e.g., Radke et al., 1989, King et al.,
1993). The increased aerosol loadings due to the passage
of the ship give rise to increases in the droplet
concentration and to reduced droplet sizes, as seen in
Figure 3.9, The relation between droplet concentration and
aerosol concentration is complex, since it depends on the
updrafts in the clouds, the degree of mixing between the
cloud and its environment and the ability of the aerosol
particles to act as CCN (for a more complete review, see
Fouquart and Isaka, 1992). Initial cloud droplet
concentration is determined by the CCN contained in the
air prior to cloud formation and by the vertical velocity of
the air; this process is well understood and confirmed by
observations (Hudson and Rogers, 1986; Leaitch et al.,
1986). Further evolution of cloud droplet spectra depends
on mixing and entrainment processes in the cloud layer.
Observations (Austin et al., 1985; Cooper, 1989;
Brenguier,1990) show that some CCN contained in the
entrained air can become activated, leading to complex
droplet spectra. Since cloud reflectance is most sensitive to
the droplet population near cloud top, mixing processes
considerably degrade the ability of simple models to
predict the influence of changes in aerosol concentration or
cloud optical properties.

their small size enables them to be transported up to cloud

aerosols derived from SO, and NO, emissions or from
natural DMS emissions. Positive correlations between

"relationship (Nguyen et al., 1983).

It may be inferred from the measurements of Hudson
(1991) that growth of CCN is rapid in the case of
anthropogenic CCN, but slower for natural CCN. Model
calculations show that the time needed to transform DMS
into CCN active at 0.2-0.3% supersaturation can be 1-7
days, depending on the oxidation mechanism assumed (Lin
and Chameides, 1993; Raes, 1993). This difference is
important since the time would be either smaller or larger
than the time-scales of synoptic meteorological processes.
Charlson et al. (1987) postulated a potential feedback
mechanism since the DMS source might be temperature or
radiation sensitive. Certain links of this mechanism have
received observational support (Ayers and Gras, 1991;
Hegg ef al., 1991) and support from calculations (Raes,
1993) showing a positive correlation between CCN and
DMS emissions. Satellite observations by Durkee et al.
(1991) show plumes of aerosol extending downwind from
urban pollution sources and also from regions which
would be expected to act as source regions for DMS. The
analysis highlighted aerosol smaller than about 0.5 um; if
such aerosol is composed of sulphate particles, it would be
expected that these plumes would be regions of high CCN
concentration. The multi-year observational programme at
Cape Grim has yielded a data set showing clear seasonal
correlations between DMS, sub-micrometer sulphate
aerosol, CCN and cloud optical depth (Ayers er al, 1991,
Ayers and Gras, 1991, Boers ef al., 1994). Nitrates
produced by gaseous reactions are highly soluble in water
and hence would be expected also to act as good CCN.

This probably is a result of the former containing soluble

that organic condensates, some from biomass burning, can
also play a role in the CCN budget, and may be at least as
important as sulphate aerosols in some regions; Rogers et

calculate the change in aerosol mass during long-range
transport, it is still difficult to do the same for the aerosol

coalescence in clouds will reduce the aerosol number
concentration but growth within cloud increases the
number of CCN at lower supersaturations for subsequent

this to marine stratiform clouds, which cover 25% of the
Earth, Charlson e¢ a/. (1987) calculated that an increase of
30% in the droplet population would yield a global forcing
of about -1.7 War’, Similar estimates have been obtained
from sensitivity studies with general circulation models

Northern Hemisphere are 0.8 ¢m smaller over land and 0.4

anthropogenic aerosols, and applying this again to marine

the effect of anthropogenic acrosol is to reduce the

and soot) is necessary both to allow the development of
quantitative connections to aerosol or aerosol-precursor
sources and to provide critical information on which to
base estimates of particle refractive index. It is necessary
to utilise appropriate sampling methods that allow the size
dependence of composition and physical properties to be
determined and to provide standardisation and
intercalibration of measurement methods. The
development of specialised techniques for molecular
speciation of organics should occur over the next few
years.

"It is presently possible to make local measurements, in
clear air, of the aerosol size distribution in the size range
10 to 10 4m, together with the total number of particles,
although there are problems measuring the concentration
of interstitial aerosol particles in clouds. It is also possible
to measure the mean particle composition within several
particle size ranges and the total mass of aerosol. The
development of improved techniques for size-resolved
chemical analysis will clarify the relation between aerosol
size distribution and source strengths. Ground based and
satellite remote sensing is essential to relate the detailed
local measurements to aerosol forcing on a regional or
global scale and many developments are likely in the
availability and scope of such measurements over the next
few years.

Satellite remote sensing which enables aerosol size and
loading to be estimated, is essential if the global impact of
aerosols is to be properly assessed. Only satellite
monitoring can achieve the global coverage and the
necessary spatial resolution to measure such
inhomogeneous fields as aerosols. However, remote
sensing of aerosol properties poses many problems. Penner
et al. (1994) identify a number of satellite instruments
which will be flown within the next ten years and offer the
possibility of improved measurements of aerosol physical
properties on the global scale. The development of
instruments which provide polarisation information will
enable considerable advances to be made. However, it is
essential that such measurements be combined with
aerosol chemical measurements for which remote sensinyz

Detailed information on the height dependence of
aerosol backscatter, absorption coefficient and optical
depth can only be obtained using aircraft, although most of
the necessary instrumentation is available. Aircraft
observations are also necessary to clarify the way in which
aerosol optical properties vary with humidity as the
hygroscopic elements of the particles grow. Studies are
already planned to make detailed measurements at a
variety of locations where the aerosols are believed to have
different origins and characteristics. One experiment is
currently under way over the ocean near Tasmania, where
anthropogenic influences are small, and another will be
undertaken in the North Atlantic, where, depending on the
air trajectory, both polluted and relatively clean conditions
may be encountered. Clearly, such detailed observations

"aerosols affect climate are generally well established, there

The problems of characterising the anthropogenic aerosol
content by size and chemical composition, and the spatial
and temporal variability of aerosol properties, are crucial
to the development of improved estimates of direct
radiative forcing. Further work is also needed to relate the
physical properties of different types of aerosol particle to
their radiative properties. The major problems in the
estimation of the indirect radiative forcing concern the
relationship between aerosol particle concentrations and
cloud droplet or ice crystal populations and the impact of
microphysical changes on the optical properties of clouds
which often have considerable spatial and temporal
variability. Developments over the next few years will help
to resolve some of the outstanding problems through the
combined use of in-situ. observations, satellite

The integration of local measurements with global fields of
aerosol properties requires the use of aerosol models which
can then be used to estimate the contribution of different
aerosols to the net aerosol forcing. Such models should
include the variety of aerosol sources and removal
processes. Present models rely on many empirical
relationships and pay little attention to the variety of
aerosol types. However, the developments outlined above
should, over the next few years, provide the observational
support necessary for the development of improved
models.

Extension of the current understanding of the

Global-mean radiative forcing is a valuable concept
for giving at least a first-order estimate of the
potential climatic importance of various forcing
mechanisms. However, there could be limits to its
utility because the relationship between global-mean
radiative forcing and global-mean surface
temperature change may not be as simple as
previously thought. For example, its general
applicability has recently been questioned in the
cases of forcing due to ozone and tropospheric
aerosols, where changes in concentration are highly
variable horizontally and/or vertically.

"of biomass burning has received much less attention
and is even more uncertain; the direct global-mean
radiative forcing since pre-industrial times may lie in
the range -0.05 to -0.6 Wm. Soot carbon in
tropospheric aerosols has the potential to reduce the
magnitude of the aerosol forcing; however global
estimates are not yet available.

Estimates exist for the indirect effect of acrosols on
cloud droplet sizes. The radiative forcing is believed
to be negative and may be of a similar magnitude to
the direct radiative forcing duc to aerosol changes
but the uncertainty is much larger. The possible
effects of aerosols on cloud liquid water content and
cloud cover are just beginning to be investigated.

"The volcanic eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in June 199]
resulted in a large enhancement to the stratospheric
aerosol layer; this caused a transient but large global-
mean negative forcing that peaked at about 4 Wm7>
and exceeded 2 Wm for about one year. Calculated
radiative forcings are broadly consistent with values
deduced from satellite observations.

General Circulation Model (GCM) simulations of
the effect of the Mt. Pinatubo eruption on surface
and lower stratospheric temperatures show
encouraging agreement with observations. This
suggests that the GCM’s temperature response to a
transient large-scale radiative forcing of a large
magnitude is reasonable.

The direct global-mean radiative forcing due to
changes in concentrations of the greenhouse gases

within 15%. This value is essentially unchanged
from previous IPCC assessments.

The global-mean radiative forcing due to increases in
tropospheric ozone since pre-industrial times is
positive and is estimated to be a few tenths of a Wm’.
Since the late 1970s, decreases in stratospheric
ozone have led to a global-mean radiative forcing
estimated to be about -0.1 Wm. The accuracy of
these estimates is presently limited by incomplete
knowledge of the temporal, horizontal and vertical
changes in ozone.

The concept of radiative forcing (e.g., IPCC 1990 and

climate model calculations which show that there is an
approximately linear relationship between the global-mean
radiative forcing at the tropopause and the equilibrium
global mean surface temperature change. Importantly,
model calculations have shown that, for a number of
forcing mechanisms, the relationship is relatively
unaffected by the nature of the forcing (e.g., whether it be

However, they do suggest that the climate sensitivity (A in
Equation (4.1)) may be significantly different for the
forcing due to spatially inhomogenous changes in
tropospheric aerosols and in ozone than it is for the well-
mixed greenhouse gases. In particular, the work suggests
that the degree of cancellation, in the global mean,
between the positive greenhouse forcing and the negative
tropospheric aerosol forcing may be a poor guide to
eventual climate response. For example, if, by coincidence,
the global-mean radiative forcing were to be zero, due to
an exact cancellation of positive and negative forcings
with different spatial characteristics, this could not be
taken to imply the absence of regional-scale or possibly
even global climate change. We continue to compare
global mean radiative forcings in this chapter, but we do so
with caution. The resolution of this issue will be an
important topic for future IPCC reports.

In preparing this review some difficulty has been
experienced in intercomparing work performed by
different authors because some have applied the term
“radiative forcing” to the instantaneous change in
tropopause irradiance, not allowing for any change in
stratospheric temperature. In other publications it is not
clear which definition of radiative forcing has been
adopted. The forcing should be calculated as a global mean
using appropriate temperature, humidity and cloud

"because the timescale of the adjustment is a few months,
compared with the decadal time-scale required for the
surface-atmosphere system to adjust to the forcing, due to
the large thermal inertia of the oceans. One additional
feature of allowing for stratospheric adjustment is that the
change in the net irradiance is then the same at the
tropopause as at the top of the atmosphere; this is not the
case when stratospheric temperatures are unadjusted (see
Hansen et al., 1981).

that the net irradiance at the tropopause, evaluated for a

there is a need to assess both the effect of the changes, and
the potential impact of remaining uncertainties.

Increases in stratospheric water vapour might also result
from a climate feedback, but the interest here is that they
are expected to increase as a result of an increased rate of
methane oxidation as methane concentrations rise. In IPCC
(1990), the direct effect of methane was increased by 30%
to account for the stratospheric water vapour increases
whilst WMO (1991) reports a range of 22-38%. However,
these numbers have been disputed. Lelieveld er al. (1993)

to be about 5% of the direct methane effect, whilst
Hauglustaine et a/. (1994) find it to be about 1%, Rind and

reach 25% by the year 2100 (there is a typographical error
in the paper indicating the value is 50%) whilst the effect
is much less for earlier years. There appears to be a
growing consensus around a smaller value and we propose
that the radiative forcing of stratospheric water vapour
changes due to methane changes be taken to be of order of
5% of the methane radiative forcing. There are no
available observations with which to constrain model
estimates of decadal time-scale changes in stratospheric
water vapour; the accuracy of models depends on their
ability to describe methane and water vapour in the lower

It is sometimes stated that, because there is so much CO, already in the atmosphere, it is “saturated” and extra CO,
can have no additional greenhouse effect. The purpose of this box is to present a simplified explanation as to why

this is a misconception.
"	Text
"HHS [5 @ MUISCONCePUOn,

When gases are present in small concentrations (the halocarbons are examples) the radiative effect of a gas is
almost linear in concentration; doubling the concentration of, for example, CFC-11 will approximately double its
greenhouse effect. This is not the case for greenhouse gases present in larger concentrations, for well-understood
reasons (see e.g., Goody and Yung, 1989). Doubling the concentration of CO, from its present day concentrations
leads to a 10-20% increase in the total greenhouse effect due to CO, ~ this factor is well-understood and has been
included in climate models for several decades.

"zero (see Figure 4.1a — note: the feature at about 10 4m is mainly due to ozone).

Figure 4.1c shows the modelled effect of an instantaneous change in CO, on the net irradiance at the tropopause.
(The change in concentration between 1980 and 1990 is chosen for the purposes of illustration.) All other factors,
such as cloudiness and temperature are held fixed. This plot indicates significant changes in irradiance. At the
centre of the 15 4m band, the increase in CO, concentration has almost no effect — the CO, absorption is indeed
saturated at these wavelengths. Away from the band centre CO, is less strongly absorbing so that an increase in
CO, concentration does have an effect. The net irradiance at the tropopause decreases — this corresponds to positive
radiative forcing that would tend to warm the climate system. As more and more CO, is added to the atmosphere,
more of its spectrum will become saturated — but there will always be regions of the spectrum which remain
unsaturated and capable of enhancing the greenhouse effect if CO, concentrations are increased. An example is
the 10 4m band system. As shown in Figure 4.1b, it is about 1 million times weaker than the peak of the 15 wm
band but its contribution to the irradiance change in the lower frame is much higher than might be anticipated; as
CO, concentrations increase, the 10 wm band would increase in its importance relative to the
15 yam band.

ozone in the lower stratosphere will lead to a negative

ozone change with altitude. In the absence of reliable data
near the tropopause, the different assumptions made in
model computations of the forcing can Icad to a significant

The overall effect of observed stratospheric ozone
depletion on radiative forcing has not been significantly
updated since WMO (1991) which reported an adjusted
radiative forcing of about -0.1 Wm between 1980 and
1990. Hansen et al. (1993a) compute a global mean
adjusted forcing of -0.2+0.1 Wm between 1970 and
1990. Such values represent a small but not neglibible
offset to the total greenhouse forcing from changes in CO,,
CH,, N,O and the CFCs which resulted in a forcing of
about 0.45 Wm between 1980 and 1990.

December, 1963 to November, 1988, Oort and Liu (1993)
infer a trend in the global lower stratospheric (100-50

is apparent during all seasons. Latitudinal profiles of the
estimated trends show that the cooling of the lower

Southern Hemisphere high latitudes, strongly suggesting an
association with the Antarctic “ozone hole”. These results

indicates an annual mean trend of -0.2 to -0.4°C/decade

during springtime is more negative over the period 1979 to

Hansen er al. (1993c) have used a GCM to evaluate the
telative effects due to the well-mixed greenhouse gases
and ozone upon the surface temperature. A sequence of
model runs with the 1970-1990 increases in the well-
mixed greenhouse gases only is compared with a sequence
including observed ozone changes; the members of each
sequence differ only in their initial conditions. It is
estimated that the 1970-1990 modelled surface warming
(0.35°C) is reduced by 15% due to the ozone changes.
Although there is a considerable spread among the
different GCM realisations in the sequence of experiments
performed, the results indicate that the cooling induced by
ozone loss has the potential to reduce the warming effect
obtained due to the halocarbon increases over the time
period considered. Despite the fact that only one GCM
study has been performed to study the surface temperature
tesponse, the results are consistent with expectations from
the radiative forcing and the simple relation usually
assumed for the forcing-response relationship. However,
as discussed in Section 4.8, the forcing-response
relationship (i-e., the climate sensitivity) may be sensitive
to the altitude at which the ozone perturbation is
introduced in the model.

As discussed in Chapter 2 there is observational and model
evidence for an increase in tropospheric ozone since pre-
industrial times at least in some areas; this is believed to be
due to anthropogenic emissions of hydrocarbons, oxides of
nitrogen and carbon monoxide. An increase in
tropospheric ozone leads to a positive forcing that would
tend to warm the surface-troposphere system and has been
the subject of several recent studies (¢.g., Lacis er al,
1990; WMO, 1991; Wang er al, 1993; Schwarzkopf and
Ramaswamy, 1993; Hauglustaine ef al, 1994). Wang ef

2-D radiative-dynamical-chemical model to estimate that
changes in tropospheric ozone since pre-industrial times
have contributed a global mean forcing of 0.55 Wm
over that period, with the dominant contribution in
the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, Their
computed tropospheric ozone change is in reasonable
agreement with other similar studies (WMO, 1994) and is
not inconsistent with the few available long-term surface
observations; global upper tropospheric ozone changes,
which are an important component of the forcing,
are however not well quantified by observations.
Fishman (1991), using observed trends, estimates that
between 1965 and 1985 a 1% per year trend in tropos-
pheric ozone applicd over the entire Northern Hemisphere
implies an approximate global mean forcing of 0.15
Wm, or about 20% of the effect of well-mixed green-
house gases; however since this study uses evidence from a
few northern mid-latitude sites, the extrapolation of ozone
changes to the whole hemisphere may not be valid.

The tentative conclusion of WMO (1994) is that the
radiative forcing associated with the ozone change is
similar in size to that resulting from the emissions of
CO, from aircraft: aircraft are responsible for about 4°""
of the fossil fuel emissions of CO,. The increase in high

"While it is clear that a tropospheric ozone increase alone
would lead to a positive radiative forcing and that this
would be opposite to the effect due to the lower
stratospheric losses, the sign of the net effect is uncertain
(WMO, 1985; Lacis et al., 1990; Karol and Frolkis, 1992;
Schwarzkopf and Ramaswamy, 1993; Wang et al., 1993).
Based on the global-mean estimates above, it seems likely
that radiative forcing due to changes in tropospheric ozone
has dominated since pre-industrial times. Over the past
decade or so, stratospheric ozone loss is likely to have
dominated the forcing as the stratospheric losses are more
marked than the tropospheric changes over the same
period.

"(see oecuion 4.4.2).

Additional complications in the determination of the
ozone forcing are uncertainties in the feedbacks related to
chemical processes. One example of this is the
stratospheric ozone loss-OH-methane lifetime connection.
A decrease of stratospheric ozone could lead to an increase
of UV radiation in the troposphere, thereby affecting
tropospheric photochemical processes and providing a
potential feedback via changes in tropospheric ozone and
OH (e.g., Madronich and Granier, 1992, 1994). For
example, methane lifetimes could decrease leading to
lower concentrations than would be expected in the
absence of stratospheric ozone depletion. A lower
stratospheric cooling due to the ozone loss can affect, for
example, the water vapour mixing ratios there, with the
potential to alter heterogeneous chemical reactions. Also.
consequent changes in methane in the troposphere could
be accompanied by changes in stratospheric water vapour
which, in turn, would affect the radiation balance. The
radiative forcing calculations so far have mostly employed
observed ozone changes. It is extremely desirable to have
interactive climate-chemistry-transport model
investigations that simulate correctly the observed ozone
changes and account for the chemical feedbacks in
computing the forcing.

Aerosols in the troposphere produced by anthropogenic
activities have the potential to change the globally
averaged temperature of the Earth. Aerosols may increase
the albedo both directly, by back-scattering incoming solar
radiation, and indirectly, by increasing the concentrations
of cloud condensation nuclei and therefore cloud droplets,
which would also result in more back-scattered solar
radiation. The latter is also suspected to induce further
effects through the decrease of precipitation, thus affecting
cloud lifetime and, in turn, cloud cover. On the other hand,
carbonaceous particles are strong absorbers at solar
wavelengths; over regions of high surface albedos and in
cloudy areas they can substantially decrease the amount of
radiation reflected to space. Globally, this latter effect is
expected to be small and aerosols should increase the
planetary albedo; however the influence of aerosol
absorption is only beginning to receive attention and
further research is needed.

Three important distinctions must be made betweer
tropospheric aerosol forcing and greenhouse forcing.
Firstly, estimates of the forcing due to tropospheric
aerosols are based on modelled, rather than observed,
distributions of the aerosols and their optical properties;
for most of the greenhouse gases, the concentration
changes are from observations. Secondly, the lifetime of
tropospheric aerosols is a few weeks, while for most
greenhouse gases the lifetimes range from decades
to centuries. Hence most of the aerosols in the troposphere
at the present time are the result of emissions during the
past few weeks; the enhanced greenhouse gas
concentrations are the accumulated effect of releases
over the past 10 to 100 years. As pointed out in IPCC
(1992), this means that the concentration of tropospheric
aerosols will respond far more rapidly to changes in
emissions than will the concentrations of greenhouse
gases. Thirdly, the aerosol forcing is more heterogeneous
in space and time. Thus, global-mean forcing might not
reflect its climatic importance as will be discussed in
Section 4.8. For tropospheric aerosols there is little
difference between the instantaneous and adjusted
radiative forcing; most values in the literature are
instantaneous forcings.

The radiative forcing due to sulphate aerosols
plus greenhouse gases, derived by Kiehl and

negative forcing by the aerosols offsets a significant
amount of the positive greenhouse forcing. Note that for

that the geographical pattern of forcing shown in Figure

of climate response because the atmospheric circulation
leads to a non-local response to a localised forcing (see

factor of 2 applies if the period of reference is fixed to

The global energy balance is very sensitive to cloud
albedo, particularly for marine stratus clouds which cover
about 25% of the Earth. Cloud albedo is itself calculated to
be sensitive to changes in cloud droplet number
concentration. This droplet number depends, in a
complicated manner, on the concentration of cloud
condensation nuclei (CCN) which, in turn, depends on
aerosol concentration. Through this indirect effect, the
radiative forcing caused by anthropogenic acrosol might be
further increased. This concerns both sulphate acrosols and
acrosols from biomass burning. The problem, however, is
extremely complex and many related key issues such as
the influence of cloud entrainment and mixing processes
remain mostly unknown. This matter is made more
challenging because the ability of an aerosol particle to act
as a CCN under the low supersaturations found in clouds
depends both on its size and its chemical composition.
Two features of the latter are important: the water-soluble
fraction and the presence of substances (¢.g., organic
species) that influence surface tension. Thus substantial
chemical understanding is also needed before the
CCN/cloud albedo/climate problem can be considered as

well posed.

to the indirect effect of aerosols were based on calculations
of the variations of cloud reflectances associated with
variations in droplet size, the cloud liquid water content
remaining constant. Observations (Radke et al., 1989)
suggest, however, that cloud liquid water may vary in
telation to droplet number. Clouds with smaller droplets
tend to retain their liquid water through inhibition of the
formation of drizzle. As a consequence, for constant
external conditions (turbulent surface fluxes, entrainment,
sea surface temperature, incident solar energy, etc.), clouds
with smaller droplets would tend to have liquid water
concentrations that are larger than those of similar clouds
with larger droplets. The resulting effect of these

In recent model simulations, attempts have been made to
account for these complex interactions between radiation,
cloud microphysics (e.g., cloud droplet size) and
precipitation. GCM simulations appear to exhibit a large
sensitivity to these microphysical processes: a simulation
performed with the LMD GCM using fixed sea surface
temperatures (Boucher et a/., 1994a, 1994b) investigated
the effect that an increase in cloud droplet concentration
would have on cloud properties by imposing a fourfold
increase, for illustrative purposes. The consequent changes
in cloud liquid water content and cloud cover led to a
decrease in absorbed solar radiation which was
approximately the same size as the decrease due to
changes in cloud albedos resulting from variations in
droplet size. Hence changes in cloud amount and liquid
water content could lead to a significant enhancement of
the indirect effect of aerosols.

The radiative forcing due to stratospheric aerosols is
mainly determined by the optical depth and the area-
weighted mean (or effective) radius (Lacis et al., 1992).
The surface-troposphere forcing is less sensitive to other
characteristics such as the aerosol composition and the
altitude. For particle effective radii below 2 ”m, which is
the regime that is normally observed, there is a globally
averaged cooling; above this size, the infrared radiative
effects would dominate and there would be a globally
averaged warming of the surface-troposphere system. The
sensitivity of the radiative forcing is estimated to be about
-2.5 to -3 Wm"" for a midvisible optical depth of 0.1 (Lacis
et al., 1992; Russell et al., 1993). The forcing is spatially
inhomogeneous and evolves temporally as well, consistent
with the microphysical mechanisms governing the aerosol
formation and sinks, and the global scale transport of
volcanic gases and aerosols.

"In a model investigation of the aerosol produced by the
eruption of Mt. Pinatubo, Hansen ef al. (1992) considered a
global mean midvisible optical depth that has a value of
about 0.15 ten months after the eruption, decaying
exponentially after that with a one-year time constant. The
corresponding global-mean forcing is estimated to have had
a maximum value of about -4 Wm”, and a value of about -
1 Wm until about two years following the eruption. The
volcanic aerosol forcing over the first two years after the
eruption is comparable with the greenhouse gas forcing
over the past century and is substantially greater than
greenhouse forcing over the past decade (~0.4 Wm’).
However, the effect of the aerosols from a single eruption is
felt for only a short duration unlike the greenhouse gases
which have longer lifetimes. For such a transient forcing
only a small fraction of the possible equilibrium
temperature change (Equation (4.1)) can be realised

because of the thermal inertia of the climate system.

approximately 2 years, with the Northern Hemisphere
response being larger, and with an amplitude of
approximately 0.1 to 0.2°C averaged over the 6 largest
eruptions of the past century. A particularly interesting
pattern is the warming over the Northern Hemisphere
continents in the winter following tropical eruptions and in
the second winter following high latitude eruptions. This
pattern is found both in observations (Robock and Mao.
1992) and in GCM simulations (Graf et a/., 1993). The
radiative forcing from major eruptions (including Mt.

patterns, so as to increase the transfer of heat from the
oceans to Northern Hemisphere continents during the
winter following the eruption.

variability which are more easily observed from the

The radiative forcing due to changing solar output is
obtained by multiplying the change in total solar irradiance
by a factor of (1 — planetary albedo)/4 or 0.175; the factor
of 4 is associated with the fact that the Earth's surface area
is four times the cross-sectional area of the Earth as seen
from the Sun whilst the factor (1 - planetary albedo)
ensures that only solar radiation actually absorbed by the
Earth-atmosphere system is accounted for. With this
scaling a 0.1% change in total solar irradiance would be
equivalent to a radiative forcing of 0.24 Wm? if all the
change at the top of the atmosphere was experienced at the
tropopause. In this section all changes quoted in Wm’? are
instantaneous radiative forcings rather than changes in
total solar irradiance itself.

"By far the most encouraging development in the study
of volcanic aerosol impacts has been the opportunity
to compare model computations of radiative forcings
with observations taken following the eruptions of El
Chichon and Mt. Pinatubo, particularly the latter. The
computed forcings appear to be in reasonable agreement with
inferences from observations. Further, GCM simulations,
especially based on the Mt. Pinatubo eruption, appear to
yield transient global mean temperature responses that are
reasonably consistent with observations, both for the lower
stratosphere and the surface. In this regard, the Mt. Pinatubo
eruption, being of a large magnitude, has afforded a test of
the ability of current GCMs to simulate the climate system’s
response to a large transient external radiative perturbation.
The preliminary work so far provides fair optimism for the
credibility of the models on short time-scales. However,
considerably more work in comparing model simulations
with observations remains to be done, especially evaluating
the degree of agreement in the spatial and the seasonal
responses, and in extending these findings to forcing with
longer time-scales.

A different approach to inferring variability in solar
output was presented by Nesme-Ribes and Mangeney
(1992) and Nesme-Ribes et al. (1993), who consider
evidence for changes in the solar convection pattern and in
the solar diameter within the framework of the solar
dynamo model. They include detailed historical
observations of the motion of sunspots, which allow
inference of the solar surface rotation rate. This in turn can
be related to the solar meridional circulation pattern and to
a corresponding change in kinetic energy and total solar
irradiance. They inferred a variation of the solar irradiance
during the Maunder Minimum of about 0.5% (about |
Wm”). If this interpretation is correct, it very likely
implies a smaller role for changes in solar irradiance
during the past century, when the Sun has apparently been
much more active (e.g., Foukal and Lean, 1990).

"that believed to be induced by changes in greenhouse gas
concentration over about the period of a decade, there are
several factors that are believed to make this comparison
an overestimate of the true role of the Sun upon recent
climate. First, the thermal inertia of the ocean-atmosphere
system leads to lag times between radiative forcing and
climate response that are much longer than a decade.
Therefore the steady accumulation of greenhouse gases in
the atmosphere over many decades can ultimately cause a
climatic impact far greater than the cyclic solar changes
(which average to a net of near zero over 11 years or so).
The realised surface temperature change associated with
the most recent 11-year solar cycle forcing is estimated to
be in the order of 0.02-0.06°C (Hoffert et al., 1988; Foukal
and Lean, 1990; Lee et al., 1993), much smaller than the

Hamilton (1990) examined historical records of surface

Combining these data with a wide range of plausible time-

Van Loon and Labitzke’s (1988) solar correlation results

authors, including Labitzke and Van Loon (1993, and
references therein), Reid (1991), Friis-Christensen and
Lassen (1991) and Tinsley and Heelis (1993). In these
studies, the correlations between solar indices such as
sunspots and solar cycle length, and observed
characteristics of the atmosphere (e.g., temperature at
particular locations, global average sea surface
temperature, etc.) are examined. Some authors have
questioned the usefulness of solar-cycle correlation
studies, noting that undersampling and/or aliasing of other
periodic atmospheric phenomena could lead to spurious
results (e.g., Teitlebaum and Bauer, 1990; Salby and Shea,
1991; Dunkerton and Baldwin, 1992). A combination of,
for example, biannual and quasi-biennial oscillations could
induce 10- to 12-year periodicities and hence lead to
correlations similar to those observed, but unrelated to
solar forcing (Dunkerton and Baldwin, 1992). In addition,
internal variability of the climate system, or other
mechanisms such as changes in ocean circulation, could
lead to 10- to 12-year oscillations over short records which
could be misinterpreted as solar signals.

evidence for the solar forcing of the middle atmosphere is
not straightforward because of the short record (from 1 to
3 cycles), so that no relationship can be considered well-
established statistically. Recent analysis of stratospheric
ozone, wind and temperature data by Hood et al. (1993)

in all of these parameters that are qualitatively consistent

of Kodera and co-workers (¢.g., Kodera et al., 1990;
Kodera, 1991) suggesting a strong solar-cycle dependence
of the strength of the upper stratospheric polar night jet.
Kodera et al. (1990) noted that changes in the position and
strength of the zonal winds near the stratopause in
December appeared to influence the tropospheric
westerlies observed in the following February, perhaps via
wave-mean flow interactions. Such changes are
qualitatively consistent with the findings of Labitzke and

Labitzke and Van Loon (1993) noted remarkably high
correlations between stratospheric temperatures and solar
indices (such as solar emissions at a wavelength of 10.7
cm), as well as an apparent propagation of such
correlations in the form of planetary-scale temperature
patterns throughout the troposphere (with amplitudes
exceeding 1°C in some cases). Kodera (1993) showed, by
examining running correlations, that undersampling is not
the origin of the Labitzke/Van Loon oscillation. However,
it is clear that the large changes in temperature noted by
Labitzke and Van Loon (1993) and others are inconsistent
with observed changes in the radiative forcing associated
with the well-documented total solar irradiance
fluctuations of at least the past decade (and very probably
the past century). Observations also show that the
ultraviolet region of the spectrum is subject to much larger
fluctuations over the 11-year solar cycle, i-e., 5-10% at 0.2
um, and 2-6% at 0.21-0.25 um, decreasing to less than 1%
by 0.29 wm (Rottman, 1988; Cebula et a/., 1992; Lean et
al., 1992a). These wavelengths are all absorbed well above
the tropopause. If this forcing resulted only in local
stratospheric temperature changes, then there would be
little direct impact upon surface climate. Nevertheless, the
likely stratospheric dynamical responses to this forcing and
the physical mechanisms that could transmit and possibly
amplify their effects in the troposphere need also to be
considered.

"for the planetary albedo,

An exploratory calculation of the effect of changes in
surface albedo might assume that 20% of the tropical rain
forest has been lost over a 30 year period (Henderson-
Sellers and Gornitz, 1984) with the surface albedo
changing from 0.13 to 0.16. Assuming the changes in
planetary albedo to be about one-third of the surface
albedo change (due to effects of clouds and atmospheric
gases) then for a diurnal-mean incident solar radiation of
400 Wm”, the 30 year radiative forcing actually over the
tropical forests would be about -0.8 Wm. Locally this
could be a significant fraction of, but the opposite sign to,
the greenhouse forcing over the same period (+1.2 to 1.5
Wm) but it must be emphasised that this surface albedo
effect would occur only over 7% of the globe. However,
the assumed change in surface albedo has not yet been
confirmed by recent global satellite surveys (e.g., Whitlock
et al., 1994); the surface albedo fields from such surveys
do not yet agree in either absolute value or spatial gradient.
A complete reassessment would need to consider other
possible changes in surface albedo.

Observations since the late 1970s indicate that the
change in radiative forcing between the maximum
and minimum of the 11-year solar cycle is about
0.24 Wm2. Although this is a substantial fraction of,
for example, the decadal increment of radiative
forcing due to greenhouse gases, the fact that it is
cyclic means that such changes in solar irradiance
are likely to play only a negligible role in surface-
troposphere climate variations.

Extension of current understanding of the
relationship between observed solar irradiance
change and other indicators of solar variability
indicates that long-term increase in solar irradiance
since the 17th century might have been climatically
significant. A radiative forcing of about 0.3 Wm?
since 1850 has been suggested, but uncertainties are
large.

Observations of Sun-like stars suggest that solar
variability could be larger in the future, but current
understanding of the Sun indicates that this
variability might not exceed the changes inferred for
the Sun during the past few centuries.

Studies using limited records indicate correlations of
winds and temperatures with the solar cycle.
However, their interpretation remains controversial
on statistical grounds. No physical mechanism has
been proposed that is quantitatively consistent with
the relationships implied by the correlations.

require knowledge of emissions of precursors and their
distribution and the chemical transformations that generate
and destroy the aerosols and ozone, as well as the
advective processes; confidence in our current ability to
model these processes is not high (see Chapters 2 and 3).
There are additional significant uncertainties in the optical
properties of the aerosols. Confidence in forcing
calculations is low. The forcings due to aerosols and
tropospheric ozone changes are of opposite sign, but might
be of a similar magnitude and may have similar spatial
patterns. Two points of importance are that firstly, our
confidence in the estimates of both tropospheric ozone
forcing and aerosol forcing is low, and secondly, the two
processes are related, as the combustion processes leading to
the production of aerosols or their precursors also
generally lead to the production of ozone precursors. It
may therefore be desirable to consider their combined effect.

Averaged over several years the forcing due to individual

significance compared to other forcing mechanisms. Over
the past century it is unlikely that there have been large

observational support for such a statement is lacking.
Nevertheless, within the century, volcanic eruptions have
been distributed unevenly in time, such that the period
from about 1925 to 1960 was notably lacking in eruptions
of potential climatic importance compared with the periods
before and after (see e.g., Robock, 1991). Sato et al.’s

GISS GCM with a simple ocean to explore the dependence
of the modelled temperature evolution when a variety of
forcings are imposed. Although they do not quantify the
degree of agreement between observed and modelled
temperature changes, they do conclude that the inclusion
of solar forcing and tropospheric aerosol forcing does
achieve a greater consistency with observations than
greenhouse gases alone. They also argue that the net
tropospheric aerosol forcing cannot be much greater than
their 1850-1990 estimate of -0.9 Wm.

New scenarios of possible future concentrations of
greenhouse gases and aerosols are not presented in this
report, so earlier estimates from IPCC (1992) are not
updated (see also Wigley and Raper (1992) and Wigley
(1994)). Between 1990 and 2100 the positive forcing due
to the well-mixed greenhouse gases (i.e. excluding ozone)
ranges from 3.4 to 8.5 Wm"" depending on assumptions
about population growth, economic growth, resource
availability and policy. For all assessments CO, is the
dominant greenhouse gas, contributing between 76 and
84% of the total.

greenhouse gas and sulphate aerosol and impose a
speculative representation of the effect of solar cycle
length variations on solar constant with an undetermined
amplitude B. They find the climate sensitivity and B which
yield the largest value of explained variance. The results
show that the explained variance is highest (61.6%) when
the solar cycle effects are included on their own; however,
it is only slightly lower (60.7%) when greenhouse gases
and tropospheric aerosols are included. The results
demonstrate that the explained variance is a very poor
guide to the contribution of different forcing mechanisms.

Wigley and Raper (1992) also include estimates of the
impact of sulphate aerosol forcing (which includes direct
and indirect effects) which are in the range +0.2 to -1.4
Wm? for the period 1990-2100. The positive forcing
occurs for certain scenarios where sulphur emissions
decline over the century; because the aerosols are so short-
lived, they respond quickly to emission changes and the
aerosol concentration decreases. Given the large
uncertainties in estimating the contemporary aerosol
radiative forcing and in estimating future aerosol
concentrations (see Table 3.8), we can have little
confidence in such estimates.

this variability might require that an appreciable
fraction of the inter-decadal variance does not need
to be explained in terms of forcing mechanisms

they assume that the surface temperature record is of
uniform reliability since the mid-19th century so that
the modelled temperatures are required to fit the
observations equally well for all periods;

they either assume values for climate sensitivity and
effective thermal inertia, or use them as floating

they assume the same climate sensitivity for all

sulphate aerosol indirect forcing to the year 2060. They
use the IPCC (1990) Scenarios with future SO, emissions
taken to be a fixed fraction of fossil fuel consumption. In
their model the effectiveness of sulphur emissions at
changing cloud albedo decreases as the aerosol
concentration increases. Thus while they estimate that the
indirect sulphate effect might offset 50% of the CO,

forcing as an appropriate index with which to assess both
the relative and absolute climatic impacts of changes in
forcing. However, there are clearly limits to the
applicability of the concept. Palaeoclimatic simulations
(e.g., Kutzbach, 1992) which adopt different orbital
parameters to those of the present day are able to generate
marked regional climate responses, despite the fact that the
global mean incident solar radiation is unaltered (even the
changes on time-scales of 10° years, involving variation in
orbital eccentricity, are small).

"A related aspect is the dependence of the climate
sensitivity to the sign of the forcing. GCM experiments
with mixed-layer oceans can show greater sensitivity to
negative forcings than positive forcings due mainly to the
fact that the snow/sea-ice albedo effect becomes more
important in a colder climate (e.g., Wetherald and Manabe,
1975; Manabe ef al., 1991 and Roeckner ev al., 1994).
However, this asymmetry in response was very much
smaller in the coupled ocean-atmosphere GCM study of
Manabe er al. (1991) when they compared the transient
response to a halving and doubling of CO, concentration.
This indicates that caution is necessary in interpreting
forcing-response relationships in models with simplified

"Daniel et al. (1994) have produced projections of future
forcing due to halocarbons including their effect on
stratospheric ozone concentrations. They consider the
relative effectiveness of each molecule in releasing
chlorine and bromine in the lower stratosphere and
highlight the role of bromocarbons in generating the
negative radiative forcing due to ozone depletion. Their
future projections are based on assumptions concerning the
phase out of CFCs and the growth rate in emissions of
HFCs. Daniel et al.’s projections have the negative forcing
due to ozone decreasing to zero by about 2050 after which
the forcing due to the HFCs dominates; the forcing
between 1990 and 2100 is about 0.15 Wm~. Wigley
(1994), using a simpler method for the ozone effect, and
using IS92 Scenarios (IPCC, 1992), obtains a higher
forcing change for this period, with a range 0.2 to 0.4 Wm”.
Such estimates will be sensitive to assumptions about the
precise mix of halocarbons used and, more particularly, to
the assumed growth rates in emissions.

In Section 4.1.1, the rationale for using adjusted radiative
forcing to intercompare different forcing mechanisms was
presented. In a 1-D radiative convective model, the climate
sensitivity parameter was found to be remarkably
independent of the forcing mechanism. In this section the
relationship between radiative forcing and climate
response in higher dimensional models is briefly
discussed. There are two distinct issues: firstly, the extent
to which the climate sensitivity parameter (A in Equation
(4.1)) is independent of forcing mechanism and secondly,
the extent to which global-mean radiative forcing can
indicate changes on smaller scales; this has become
important with the recognition of more regional scale
forcings resulting from changes in tropospheric ozone and
aerosols. In particular, even if A was independent of
forcing mechanism, the global-mean surface temperature
change implied by summing forcings with opposing signs
and differing spatial patterns may give a misleading
impression of the size of regional-scale climate changes.

Despite the fact that the changes in concentration of the
greenhouse gases such as CO,, CH,, N,O and the CFCs
are globally relatively uniform, Figure 4.4 illustrates that
the resulting radiative forcing is anything but uniform,
owing to the influence of regional variations in
temperature, cloudiness and humidity. Thus the well-
behaved nature of the forcing-response relationship for
greenhouse gas changes is not a simple result of spatial
uniformity in its forcing.

Roeckner et al. (1994) report experiments with the

forcing is mimicked by changing the surface albedo using
the pattern of anthropogenic sulphur loading from Langner
and Rodhe (1991). Using this pattern, but reversing the
sign to give a positive forcing, it is found that the climate
sensitivity is identical to that derived from an increased
CO, experiment despite the large differences in the vertical
and horizontal patterns of the forcings. However, it is
markedly different when applied as a negative forcing, duc
to the asymmetry of the snow/sea-ice albedo feedback. As

would lead to a decrease in the forcing which would be
more marked for effective CO, than it would be for the
mixture of gases. Application of the ratios of
adjusted/unadjusted forcings from Table 4.1 gives an
adjusted CO, forcing of 2.9 Wm” and for the mixture
of gases it would be 3.0 Wm; the ratio of these two
forcings is about the same as the ratio of the global-mean
warmings calculated by Wang ef a/. Taking account of
adjustment would also lead to a slight decrease in the
regional differences in temperature change for the two
forcings. Hence the tropospheric climate sensitivity to
different mixtures of greenhouse gases appears very
similar, particularly when stratospheric adjustment is

"Taylor and Penner (1994) used a version of the NCAR
Community Climate Model with a mixed-layer ocean and
computed the pre-industrial to present day forcing due
to the direct effect of sulphate aerosols and observed
changes in CO, concentration. They performed
integrations with CO, changes alone, sulphate changes
alone and with both forcings combined. The climate
sensitivity (calculated from the instantaneous forcing)
varied markedly between experiments ranging from
1K/Wm? for sulphate alone to 2.6 K/Wm7 for sulphate
and CO,. Thus in this model the global mean forcings
from different mechanisms are a poor guide to climate
response. The pattern of climatic response is found to be
markedly different to the pattern of forcing; as an example,
in the sulphate-only case the Southern Hemisphere forcing
is only 20% of the Northern Hemisphere forcing, and yet
the Southern Hemisphere surface temperature response is
about 70% of the Northern Hemisphere value. An
outstanding issue is the high climate sensitivity of the
model (which implies a warming of 6.4°C for a doubling
of CO,) compared to other GCMs.

"The relationship between radiative forcing and climate
response is crucially important to the development of
radiative forcing (and hence any global warming potential)
as an appropriate index. For a wide range of forcing
mechanisms the forcing/response relationship appears
similar. However, some studies indicate that climate
sensitivity may be markedly different for forcings which
have a strong vertical or horizontal structure, although a
clear consensus has yet to emerge. However, in model
calculations where two opposing radiative forcings with
differing spatial patterns are applied, the global-mean
surface temperature change does not give an adequate
indication of the changes on smaller spatial scales. The need
for continued careful experimentation with both idealised
and realistic forcings in a range of different models is clearly
apparent before firm conclusions can be drawn.

"Radiative forcing indices have been developed as a relative
measure of the potential globally averaged warming effect
on the surface-troposphere system arising from emission
of a set amount (e.g., 1 kilogram) of a variety of trace
gases. These gases can exert a radiative forcing of the
climate system both directly and indirectly. Direct forcing
occurs when the emitted gas is itself a greenhouse gas.
Indirect forcing occurs when chemical transformation of
the original gas produces or destroys a gas or gases that
themselves are greenhouse gases. The indices reflect the
cumulative radiative forcing over some chosen time period
of interest. The choice of time horizon is a user choice that
depends upon issues such as the time-scales of the climate
system and the emphasis on long-term versus short-term
potential climate changes. Future changes in the numerical
indices are likely as research in related areas yields
improved input to the calculations, implying that whatever
framework is adopted for the use of these indices, it must
have flexibility to incorporate what could be substantial

changes in the specified numerical values of the indices.

The set of Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) for
greenhouse gases that is presented in this chapter is an
updating and expansion of that presented in the 1992
assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC, 1992). The time horizons of the GWPs are
20, 100, and 500 years, as was the case in IPCC (1992).
GWPs have a number of important limitations. The GWP
concept is difficult to apply to gases that are very unevenly
distributed and to aerosols. For example, relatively short-
lived pollutants such as the nitrogen oxides and the volatile
organic compounds (precursors of ozone, which is a
greenhouse gas) vary markedly from region to region
within a hemisphere and their chemical impacts are highly
variable and non-linearly dependent upon concentrations.
Further, the indices and the estimated uncertainties are
intended to reflect global averages only, and do not
account for regional effects. They do not include climatic
or biospheric feedbacks, nor do they consider any
environmental impacts other than those related to climate.
The major changes since IPCC (1992) are the following:
"	Text
"The new species are largely hydrofluorocarbons
(HFCs), which are being manufactured as substitutes
for the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and the very
long-lived fully fluorinated compounds: SF, and the
perfluorocarbons. SF, is manufactured mainly for
insulation of electrical equipment. The main source
of CF, and C,F, is production as accidental by-
products of aluminium manufacture, while other
perfluorocarbons have been suggested as potential
CFC and halon substitutes.

The decay response of a pulse of CO, in the
atmosphere, which is the reference for the GWPs,
was derived from a balanced carbon model in which
sinks are constrained to match sources that was
deemed (see Chapter 1) representative of the current
understanding of the global carbon cycle. The
reference for the GWPs of IPCC (1990, 1992) was a
three-parameter fit involving an unbalanced carbon
model. The present GWPs are 10-20% larger than
they would otherwise have been because of the
different reference.

For those species addressed in {PCC (1992), a
majority of the GWP values are larger, typically by
10-30%. These changes are largely due to (i)
changes in the carbon dioxide (CO) reference noted
above and (ii) improved values for atmospheric
lifetimes, particularly those species that are removed
by chemical reactions in the troposphere.

Both the direct and indirect components of the GWP
of methane (CH. ) have been estimated. The indirect
component is now deemed to be better understood
than at the time of the previous IPCC reports. The
effects that were incorporated include methane’s
influence on lengthening its own atmospheric decay
response time and on production of tropospheric
ozone and stratospheric water vapour. The sum of
these effects is estimated to increase substantially the
total GWP for CH, compared to its direct GWP.
Uncertainties in evaluating these effects arise from
incomplete understanding of dynamical and
chemical atmospheric processes (especially the use

Reliable radiative forcing indices for gases that form
atmospheric aerosols (e.g., sulphur dioxide, SO,) cannot
currently be formulated meaningfully, chiefly because of
the lack of understanding of many of the processes
involved (e.g., composition of the aerosols, radiative
properties) and because of uncertainties regarding the
climate response to the inhomogeneous spatial
distributions of the aerosols (Chapter 3).

"Reliable indirect GWPs are difficult to estimate for the
ozone-depleting gases (e.g., CFCs and the bromine-
containing halons) and hence are not included in this
report. Better estimates of the negative, indirect component
of the GWP arising from the reduced radiative forcing
from ozone losses in the lower stratosphere require a
detailed understanding of several factors including the
vertical profile of the ozone loss (see Chapter 4), the role
of bromine and chlorine in destroying stratospheric ozone,
and the photochemical effectiveness of each ozone-

"of the decay response time described in Chapter 2).
The product of the methane GWP and its estimated
annual anthropogenic emission is comparable to that
of CO, over a 20-year time horizon and is a
significant fraction for longer time horizons.

The sensitivity of the GWPs to a changing future
atmosphere has been explored. As was done in IPCC
(1990, 1992), the composition of the background
atmosphere used in the GWP calculations presented
herein was the present-day abundances of CO,, CH,,
and nitrous oxide (N,O), which were assumed
constant into the future. Since this is not a realistic
assumption, the sensitivity of the GWPs to a
changing future atmosphere was also explored. For
example, a choice of an increasing CO, abundance
(from 360 ppmv currently to 650 ppmv by the end of
the 22nd century) in the background atmosphere
would produce 20% larger GWPs for the longer time
horizons. The sensitivity of the direct GWPs to some
of the changes likely to be associated with an altered
climate, namely altered water vapour and clouds,
was also explored. The results suggest that the
changes in GWPs would not be substantial.

on the information in the preceding chapters of this report
(cross-referenced herein), the earlier climate-system
reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) (IPCC, 1990; 1992), the ozone-depletion reports of
the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and
the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) (WMO

the major objective of the text that follows is to update the
information on radiative forcing indices, another goal is to
note the aspects of such indices that involve user choices,
with the aim of stimulating comments that could enhance
the usefulness of the corresponding section on this topic in
the forthcoming IPCC full scientific assessment of the
understanding of climate e change (IPCC, 1995).

The availability of a simple and representative index that
quantifies the relative roles of additions of the various
greenhouse gases in causing climate change would have
considerable practical value (i) in the assessment of the
relative or aggregate contributions of the many human
activities that can cause such changes and (ii) in the
potential decisions as to how best to minimise the
magnitude of the impact of such activities on the climate
system. Indeed, as nations approach the discussion of
policies that could reduce the likelihood of human
perturbation of the Earth’s climate system, some countries
are incorporating comparative trace-gas indices in their
formulation of approaches to reducing their trace-gas
emissions. Furthermore, the Parties of the UN Framework
Convention on Climate Change will seck enhanced
scientific input regarding such indices as one of the tools
for meeting the Convention's commitment to “prevent

The first-order forcing-response relationship is the
scientific basis for using changes in radiative forcing as the
common mode for (i) comparing some of the natural
causes of climate change (¢.g., solar forcing) to some of
the human-caused interferences in the climate system (¢.g..
well-mixed greenhouse gases) or (ii) intercomparing the
relative radiative-forcing roles of the numerous greenhouse
gases. This practice is further strengthened by two facts
First, the indices represent radiative forcing, not climate
response. There are fewer uncertainties associated with
calculating changes in radiative forcing than with
calculating climate-system responses, ¢.g., global mean
surface temperature, sea level, or precipitation, Second, the
indices are relative quantities, not absolute. Calculating the
alteration in radiative forcing due to addition of a fixed
amount of greenhouse gas A relative to the same addition
of greenhouse gas B can be done more accurately than
having to know the absolute alteration in radiative forcing
due a change in a single greenhouse gas alone. The GWP
may be usefully thought of as a proxy for assessment of
the relative roles of different greenhouse gases, assuming
that the climate system responds linearly to perturbations
in radiative forcing.

The focus in the formulation of radiative forcing indices is
on the effect of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse
gases. Chapters 1 and 2 describe how emissions control
atmospheric concentrations, while Chapter 4 describes
how the atmospheric concentration of a chemical species
determines its contribution to the total radiative forcing.
Chapter 4 also illustrates how the changes in greenhouse
gas concentrations that have occurred in the past have
altered the total radiative forcing (also see Figures 2.2 to
2.4 of IPCC, 1990). However, from the viewpoint of
formulating policies for reductions in greenhouse gases.
indices that denote the relative radiative roles of
anthropogenic emissions, rather than absolute
concentration changes caused by human activities, have
received more attention (see Section 2.2.1 of IPCC, 1990).

They can be used to rank the emissions of the
various countries, i.e., a radiative-forcing-scaled net
emission for each country could include all
greenhouse gases on a common scale and hence
could represent that country’s current or projected
net contribution to greenhouse warming.

They can be the quantitative basis to a collective
“basket” approach to greenhouse-gas emission
reductions within a given country. For example, the
product of a compound’s radiative-forcing index and
the amount by which the emissions of that
compound are reduced (or the removal of that
compound is increased) could yield the equivalent
reduction in global radiative forcing achieved.
Therefore, this index could also be the quantitative
basis of the “trading” of one type of emission
reduction for another within a national goal or quota.

They can contribute to economic assessments of
trade-offs between alternative technologies, e.g.,
weighting by radiative forcing indices in comparing
the merits of one fuel against another. Such
comparisons could also be modified to include
efficiency and other technological factors.

They can function as a quantitative signal to
governmental and industrial policy makers, thereby
encouraging some activities and discouraging others.
For example, the flagging of possible candidate
substitutes for the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) that
have high radiative forcing indices could identify
them for possible avoidance.

Together with other information, they can be used as
a part of the basis for total environmental impact
assessments where several different factors or
actions are considered. For example, environmental
labelling of products or environmental audits of
industrial processes.

This point is also illustrated in Figure 5.1. The initial
dominance of the band strength in determining the
instantaneous radiative forcing at early times can be
overwhelmed by the lifetime factor at later times. As
described in Chapters 1 and 2, the atmospheric lifetime of
a gas is determined largely by the Earth-system process(es)
that remove the gas from the atmosphere, e¢.g., the
stratospheric photolytic decomposition of NO and the

"Factor 3: The time period over which the radiative effects
of the species are to be considered. Since many of the
responses of the Earth’s climate to changes in radiative
forcing are long (e.g., the centennial-scale warming of the
oceans), it is the cumulative radiative forcing of a
greenhouse gas, rather than its instantaneous value, that is
of primary importance to crafting a relevant radiative
forcing index. As a consequence, such indices involve an
integral over time. Rodhe (1990) has noted that the choice
of time interval can be compared to cumulative-dosage
effects in radiology. IPCC (1990, 1992) used integration
time horizons of 20, 100, and S00 years in calculating the
indices. Figure 5.2 shows the integrals of the decay
functions in Figure 5.1 for a wide range of time horizons.
It illustrates the need for the user of the radiative forcing
indices to select the time period of consideration. A
strongly absorbing, but short-lived, gas like HCFC-225¢ca
will contribute more radiative forcing in the short term
than a weaker-absorbing, but longer-lived, gas like N,O;
however, in the longer term, the reverse is true. Methane is
a key greenhouse gas discussed extensively in Section
5.2.5; its integrated radiative forcing would lie below that
of N,O and reach a plateau more quickly because of its
shorter lifetime.

For those gases, the relative radiative forcing will depend
upon concentration and hence upon the scenario adopted
for the future trace-gas atmospheric abundances. A key
factor in the greenhouse role of a given species is the
location of its absorption spectrum relative to the region in
the absorption of atmospheric water vapour through which
most outgoing planetary thermal radiation escapes to
space. Consequently, other things being equal, chemical
species that have strong absorption band strengths in the
relatively weak water vapour “window” are more
important greenhouse gases than those that do not. This is
illustrated in Figure 5.1, which shows how the
instantaneous radiative forcings due to the pulse emission
of 1 kilogram of various long-lived gases change as the
concentrations decay away in time after they have become
well mixed (e.g., about a year after injection into the
atmosphere). The relevant point here is on the left-hand
scale at t= 1, namely, that the radiative forcing of an equal
emission of the various gases can differ by as much as four
orders of magnitude. Laboratory studies of molecular
radiative properties are a key source of the basic
information needed in the calculation of radiative forcing
indices. The status of such spectroscopic data of
greenhouse gases is discussed in detail in Section 4.2.

Indirect effects may also be opposite in sign to the direct

stratospheric ozone layer. In addition to the well-known
direct (positive) contributions to radiative forcing of
ozone-depleting species, the resulting ozone loss in the
lower stratosphere reduces the radiative forcing at the
tropopause, thereby introducing a negative component to
the indices of these compounds. Observations of ozone

As noted above, the radiative properties of the atmosphere.
which are determined by atmospheric composition,
influence the degree to which a given greenhouse gas
contributes to greenhouse forcing. Since the atmospheric
concentrations of absorbing gases continually change, this
aspect of a radiative forcing index is a time-varying
quantity. Indeed, a somewhat “circular” situation cannot be
avoided: an index is calculated for an assumed set of future
greenhouse gas concentrations and then the subsequent use
of that number in policy decisions can cause the future
concentrations to be different from those originally
assumed! In past IPCC assessments, the then-current
atmospheric abundances of greenhouse gases were
assumed, for simplicity, to be fixed throughout the
integration over the time horizon. In this chapter, we
explore the sensitivity of radiative forcing indices to future
scenarios of atmospheric composition. Similarly. since
ambient water vapour and clouds are also major factors in
atmospheric absorption, the sensitivity of calculated
indices to likely climate-induced changes in these
parameters is also examined. The sensitivity of GWPs to
atmospheric aerosols is likely to be similar to or less than
the sensitivity to clouds because of similarities in radiative
properties. These sensitivity tests provide some insight into
how the infrared transmission and hence the indices would
be different in a potentially perturbed future climate or
altered aerosol distribution. However, this analysis does
not consider possible future changes in atmospheric
chemistry, circulation, biospheric processes. or other

A key aspect of GWP calculations is thus the choice of
the reference gas. Unfortunately from the perspective of its
selection as the reference gas, the atmospheric response
time of CO, has the largest scientific uncertainty of the
major greenhouse gases. As described in Chapter J, the
uptake of CO, is a complex process involving the
biosphere, ocean, ocean-atmosphere exchange rates, deep
ocean sediments, etc. Furthermore, CO, is also re-
circulated among these reservoirs at an exchange rate that
is poorly known at present, and it appears that the budget

a result, when co, is used as the reference, the numerical

HFC-134a, HCFC-22Sea, and N,O for different time
horizons with CO, as the reference gas. This figure
illustrates the way in which the lifetime of a gas dictates
the variation of its GWP over different time horizons,
When the lifetime of the gas in question differs
substantially from the response time of the reference gas,
the GWP is sensitive to the choice of time horizon, i.c., for
HFC-134a and HCFC-225ca (shorter) and for CF,
(longer). When the lifetime of the gas in question is
comparable to the response time of CO, (nominally on the
order of 150 yr, although it is clear that the removal of
CO, cannot be adequately described by a single, simple
exponential lifetime; see Section 5.2.1 and Chapter 1), the
GWP is relatively insensitive to choice of time horizon,
Le., for N,O. The initial GWPs (for time horizons much
shorter than the lifetime of the gas or the reference) simply
reflect the relative radiative forcing per molecule
compared to the reference gas (see Figure 5.1). For longer
time horizons, those species that decay more rapidly than
the reference gas display sharply decreasing GWPs, with
the slope of the decay being dependent mainly on the
lifetime of the gas in question. Gases with lifetimes much
longer than that of the reference gas (¢.g., CF) display
steeply increasing GWPs over their lifetimes.

Carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere decays in a
highly complex fashion, showing an initial fast decay over
the first 10 years or so, followed by a more gradual decay
over the next 100 years or so, and a very slow decline over
the thousand year time scale, mainly reflecting transfer
processes in the biosphere, ocean, and deep ocean
sediments, respectively. Because of the different time
constants for co, removal processes, the uptake of CO, is
quite different from that of other trace gases and is not well
described by a single lifetime (Moore and Braswell, 1994).
Figure 5.4 shows the decay over time of a pulse of CO,
from the range of carbon cycle models discussed in
Chapter 1. Even after several centuries, a portion of the
pulse remains in the atmosphere because of slow transfer
to the deep ocean sinks. Figure 5.4 shows that the range in
decay response among the various models considered in
this assessment is rather small; the “Bern” model as used
in Chapter 1 of this document was chosen as representative
and used for the decay response of CO, for the GWP
calculations presented in Section 5.2.4 below.

"accuracy of calculation and meaning of a globally
averaged forcing, particularly relative to a more-
evenly distributed gas like CO,, is hence weakened.
Aerosols also have spatially inhomogeneous sources
and very short atmospheric lifetimes; hence, their
spatial distributions can be quite variable. As a
result, the comparison of the radiative forcing by
aerosols and ozone precursors compared to that of
CO, is problematic (Section 4.4), but potentially
quite important.

GWPs for greenhouse gases with vertical profiles or
latitudinal variations of radiative forcing that are
markedly different from the reference gas have
larger inaccuracies. The vertical and latitudinal
distribution of the radiative perturbation of a
greenhouse gas can influence the partitioning of the
long-wave radiative-flux perturbation in the
troposphere-surface climate system. Gases with
markedly different distributions of their radiative
flux perturbations may influence the climate system
(particularly regionally) in different ways that are not
reflected simply in the GWP ratio (Wang et al.,
1991). Thus, the use of a common scale afforded by
GWPs may be weakened (see Section 4.8).

Warming and cooling components of the GWPs for
each of the ozone depleting gases may be difficult to
characterise. Ozone losses in the lower stratosphere
are larger at higher latitudes, hence, the associated
cooling has a latitudinal variation that differs from
that of the direct warming due to the ozone depleters.
Further, the globally averaged cooling is sensitive to
the vertical profile of the ozone change (see Section
4.3), and the ozone depletion caused by cach gas
depends upon its chemical properties. Incorporating
such different geographic forcings and
photochemical effects from direct and indirect
components into a single radiative forcing index
likely requires detailed study of chemical ozone-loss
processes and associated radiative forcing that is
beyond the scope of the present assessment.

In IPCC (1990), an unchanging atmosphere was assumed
with the trace gas concentrations, hence the radiative
properties of the atmosphere, unchanging in time.
However, likely (but unforecastable) changes in CO, CH,,
or N,O concentrations will lead to future changes in the
radiative forcing per molecule of those gases (and perhaps
others whose spectral bands overlap with them), as noted
previously. The radiative properties of CO, are particularly
sensitive to changes in concentration, since the large
optical depth of CO, in the current atmosphere makes its
radiative emission depend logarithmically on
concentration. Thus, the forcing for a particular
incremental change of CO, will become smaller in the
future, when the atmosphere is expected to contain a larger
concentration of the gas. In the case of CH, and N,0, there
is a square-root dependence of the forcing on their
respective concentrations (IPCC, 1990); hence, just as for
CO,, the forcings due to a specified increment in cither gas
are expected to become smaller for future scenarios. For
the other trace gases considered here, the present and
likely future values are such that the direct radiative

major greenhouse gases are now rather well known as a
result of laboratory studies (see Chapter 4 and references
therein). Weak spectral lines for ozone and methane have
been included in databases such as HITRAN, but are
unlikely to be important for GWP analyses (see Chapter
4). The radiative band strengths of many HFCs and
HCFCs have been measured in the laboratory (e.g.,
Clerbaux et al., 1993). While significant uncertainties do
remain in band strengths for some of these molecules, as
described in Chapter 4 and in more detail in WMO (1994),
it is important to note that their concentrations and
emission rates in the present atmosphere are quite small, so
that their contribution to current radiative forcing is not
presently significant. As noted in Chapter 4, the radiative
forcings per molecule used in this report are very close to
those recommended in IPCC (1990) and are believed to be
accurate to within about 25%. The estimated radiative
forcings per molecule of HFC-125 and -152a have
changed relative to IPCC (1992), by +15% and +8%,
respectively.

While it is likely that water vapour will change in a future

GWPs of the great majority of molecules of interest here is
expected to be quite small. For example, the model of
Clerbaux ef al., (1993) was used to test the sensitivity of
the direct GWP for CH, to changes in water vapour. Even
for changes as large as 30% in water vapour concentration,
the calculated GWP of CH4 changed by only a smail
percentage (C. Granier, personal communication, 1993).
For many other gases whose radiative impact occurs
largely in the region where water vapour’s absorption is
relatively weak, similar or smaller effects are likely.

"Clouds composed of water drops or ice crystals possess
absorption bands in virtually the entire terrestrial infrared
spectrum. By virtue of this property, they modulate
considerably the infrared radiation escaping to space from
the Earth’s surface and atmosphere. Since cloud tops
generally have lower temperatures than the Earth’s surface
and the lower part of the atmosphere, they reduce the
outgoing infrared radiation. This reduction depends mainly
on cloud height and optical depth. The higher the cloud,
the lower is its temperature and the greater its reduction in
infrared emission, On the other hand, higher clouds (in
particular high ice clouds) tend to have low water content
and limited optical depth. Such clouds are partially
transparent, which reduces the infrared trapping effect.

Figure 5.5 illustrates the fact that the dependence of the
AGWP of CO, upon choice of future atmospheric CO,
concentrations is not a highly sensitive one. This critical
point is further quantified in Figure 5.6, which shows, for
the adopted CO, decay response, how the AGWP would
differ for choices of future atmospheric CO, scenarios
other than constant current concentrations. A constant
atmosphere at pre-industrial] values (280 ppmv) would
yield AGWPs for CO, different by less than 20% for all
time horizons. Similarly, the increasing CO,
concentrations of the S650 Scenario would yield AGWPs
that are smaller by 15% or less as compared to constant
current concentrations. Note that values of -15% do not
imply a change in sign of the AGWP or GWP, only that
the AGWP becomes as much as 15% smaller when
possible increases in future CO, abundances up to 650
ppmv are considered rather than constant current values.
The effects are small because decreases in the radiative
forcing per molecule due to the increasing CO,
atmospheric abundance tend to be opposite in sign to those
due to the changed CO, decay response of balanced CO,
models (see Caldeira and Kasting, 1993 and Wigley,
1994a). This similarity in AGWPs suggests that the
telative radiative effect of each added kilogram of gas is
not strongly dependent upon future CO, abundances, but
the total absolute radiative forcing will. of course, be
strongly dependent upon future abundances (e.g., the total
number of kilograms of added gas).

Methylchloroform is a relatively short-lived gas
destroyed mainly by reaction with the reactive OH radical
in the troposphere (although its oceanic uptake must also
be considered, see Butler et a/., 1991). Observations of the
trend in methylchloroform concentration, together with
information regarding emissions and other sinks (e.g.,
oceanic uptake), can be used to deduce its lifetime and
hence the globally averaged atmospheric OH concentration
(Prinn et al., 1992). The lifetimes of other key gases
destroyed by OH (i.e., CH,, HCFCs, HFCs) can then be
inferred relative to that of methylchloroform (see, e.g.,
Prather and Spivakovsky, 1990) with greater accuracy than
would be possible from a priori calculations of the
complete tropospheric OH distribution, so long as the
gases are long-lived (hence relatively well-mixed). It is
likely that methane is also destroyed in part by uptake to
soil (IPCC, 1992), but this process is believed to be
relatively slow and makes a small contribution to the
removal of this gas from the atmosphere (see Chapter 2).
Possible soil or ocean sinks are not considered for any

for the lifetimes of many of the gases destroyed primarily
by reaction with tropospheric OH (e.g., HCFC-22, HCFC-

IPCC (1992), due mainly to recent studies suggesting a
shorter lifetime for CH,;CCl, based upon improved
calibration methods and upon an oceanic sink (Butler et

gases destroyed mainly by photolysis in the stratosphere
(e.g., CFC-12, CFC-113, H-1301) are about 10% shorter
than in IPCC (1992) due to a shorter estimated lifetime for
CFC-11 and related species. Lifetime estimates of a few
other gases have also changed due to improvements in the
understanding of their specific photochemistry (e.g., note
that the lifetime for CFC-115 is now estimated to be about

The uncertainty in the GWP of any trace gas other than
CO, depends upon the uncertainties in the AGWP of CO,
and the AGWP of the gas itself. The uncertainties in the
relative values of AGWPs for various gases depends upon
the uncertainty in relative radiative forcing per molecule
(estimated to be about 25% for most gases, as shown in
Chapter 4) and on the uncertainty in the lifetimes of the
trace gas considered (which are likely to be accurate to
about 10% for CFC-11 and CH,CCL, as shown in Chapter
2, and perhaps 20-30% for other gases derived from them).
Combining these dominant uncertainties (in quadrature)
suggests uncertainties of Jess than #35% in the direct
AGWPs for nearly all of the trace gases considered in
Table 5.2 . We note that a few of the newest CFC
substitutes (namely HFC-236fa, -245 ca, and -43-10 mee)
have larger uncertainties in lifetimes since fewer kinetic

 

studies of their chemistry have been reported to date.
Uncertainties in the AGWPs for CO, depend upon
uncertainties in the carbon cycle (see Chapter 1) and on the
future scenario for CO,. The effect of the latter uncertainty
is likely to be relatively small, and a range is illustrated in

discussed in IPCC (1990) and IPCC (1992) as an indirect
effect on OH concentrations, and thus is not new. It arises
through the fact that small changes in OH due to addition
of a small pulse of CH, slightly affect the rate of decay of
the much larger amount of CH, in the background
atmosphere, thereby influencing the net removal of the
added pulse. It is critical to note that the exact value of the
CH, pulse response time depends upon a number of key
factors, including the absolute amount of CH,, size of the

There are substantial inhomogeneities and other
complexities to contend with regarding the indirect GWPs
of CO, NO,, and the NMHCs. The lifetime of NO, in the
troposphere is only a few days, while those of CO and
NMHCs are of the order of months to days. The short
lifetime of NO, coupled with scattered sources (especially
from anthropogenic emissions) leads to highly variable
surface concentrations ranging from a few tenths to tens of
ppbv in the polluted boundary layer. For this range of NO,
abundances, the photochemistry of O, production in the
troposphere is a complex and highly non-linear function of
added NO, (e.g., Lin et al., 1988; Thompson, 1992). This
non-linearity, together with the difficulty of accurately
calculating the transport and removal of NO, species,
imply that the indirect effect of ozone production from

distribution is not dependent upon the details of transport
phenomena, such as boundary layer venting and

production in the mid- and upper troposphere is more
effective for radiative forcing than that near the surface
(see Chapter 4), emphasising the radiative role of chemical
ozone production processes that can take place in the free
troposphere. Much of the indirect effect of ozone
production through CH, chemistry likely takes place in the
mid- to upper troposphere, where NO, abundances
generally exceed the approximate 10-30 pptv threshold at
which the chemistry switches from ozone depletion to
ozone production (see Ehhalt and Drummond, 1988;
Fehsenfeld and Liu, 1993). These considerations suggest
that the indirect effect of ozone production for CH, GWPs

Stratospheric ozone depletion by halocarbons causes
significant cooling near the tropopause and hence is
believed to induce a negative radiative forcing of the
surface-troposphere system (Ramaswamy ef al., 1992;
IPCC, 1992, WMO, 1992; ). A recent General Circulation
Model (GCM) calculation suggests that the globally
averaged radiative flux change at the tropopause due to
ozone depletion can be related to surface temperature
responses (see Chapter 4). However, quantitative
evaluation of the magnitude of this effect requires detailed
knowledge of the vertical profile of ozone loss
(Schwarzkopf and Ramaswamy, 1993). Further, a full
evaluation of the radiative impact of each halocarbon
requires detailed consideration of the photochemical
effectiveness of each contributing gas (particularly
bromocarbons), and future scenarios for halocarbon and
ozone change (see Daniel et a/., 1994). Hence, the indirect
effects of halocarbons will not be included here, but will
be considered in WMO (1995), where the photochemistry
of ozone depletion is described in detail. A point worth
noting is the possibility that, for a given halocarbon, the

"5.2.5.2 Indirect effects upon the GWP of CH,

Briihl (1993), Lelieveld et a@/. (1993) and Hauglustaine er
al., (1994a,b). In this report, we consider those results
together with inputs from Chapters 2 and 4 of this

tropospheric models considered in Section 2.9 provides
insight regarding the likely range in ozone production.
Uncertainties in these calculations include those related to
the NO, distributions employed in the various models,
formulation of transport processes, and other factors
discussed in detail in Chapter 2. The estimated uncertainty
in the indirect GWP for CH, from tropospheric ozone
production given below is based upon the calculated mid-
to upper tropospheric ozone response of the models to the
prescribed methane perturbation at northern mid-latitudes
(see Figure 2.16) and consideration of the current
inadequacies in the understanding of many relevant
atmospheric processes. The calculated ozone changes from
the model simulations of Chapter 2 for a 20% increase in
methane implies an indirect effect that is about 25£15% of
the direct effect of methane (or 19412% of the total), using
the infrared radiative code of the NCAR model. A similar
number is estimated in Chapter 4. The upper end of this
range is close to that presented in IPCC (1990).

increase the GWPs by approximately 3 for all time
horizons (see IPCC, 1990). However, as noted by Lelieveld
and Crutzen (1992), this indirect effect is unlikely to apply
to biogenic production of CH, from most sources (e.g.,
from rice paddies), since the ultimate source of the carbon
emitted as CH, in this case is CO), implying no net gain of
carbon dioxide. While non-biogenic methane sources such
as mining operations do lead indirectly to a net production
of CO, this methane is often included in national carbon
production inventories. In this case, consideration of CO,
production in the GWP could lead to “double-counting”,
depending upon how the GWPs and inventories are
combined. As shown in Table 2.3, most human sources of
methane are biogenic, with another large fraction being
due to coal mines and natural gas. Thus, the indirect effect
of CO, production does not apply to much of the CH,
inventory, and is not included in Table 5.5 (in contrast to

effects among various contributing factors. The ranges in
CH, GWPs shown in Table 5.5 reflect the uncertainties in
response time, lifetime, and indirect effects as discussed

few specific countries. For CH,, the range includes the
uncertainties in GWPs discussed above and presented in
Table 5.5. For the sum of CFCs and halons, it is possible
that the net GWP is small or even negative when the
indirect effects of ozone depletion are considered, and the
range depicted in the figure includes the upper limit
represented by the direct effects of these gases only. The
figure illustrates that future anthropogenic radiative
forcings due to current emissions are likely to be induced
primarily by CO, and methane (but this depends upon the
future state of the atmosphere through its effect on the
methane response time as noted above and based upon
Chapter 2; Figure 5.7 refers to a future concentration of
methane close to today’s value). Further quantifying the
relative magnitudes of the two, as well as the effects of
other gases, requires better understanding of emissions,
response times, and indirect effects.

"The sinks (hence atmospheric lifetimes) of most of
the major ozone-depleters — chlorofluorocarbons
and bromocarbons - are well known. There is i

"some level of uncertainty and hence a numerical
range within which the ODP is likely to lie. The
median value of the estimated range of possible
values was the one provided to the Protocol. The
same single-value issue is likely to emerge in
discussions of the use of GWPs in implementing the
Climate Convention with, for example, a “basket”
approach within which greenhouse gases can be
“traded” on a scaled basis.

Periodic Updates of ODPs From Science
Assessments. The Montreal Protocol requires that
periodic scientific assessments be made of the state
of the science of the ozone layer. Updated ODPs
have been part of these assessments, e.g., WMO
(1992). Thus, in principle, the “certified” values can
be altered if the advance in scientific understanding
warrants it. However, the rapidity with which policy
has moved subsequently to phase out all of the
halocarbons that have high ODPs (e.g., the 1990
Amendments) has meant that the “basket” feature of
the Protocol and the mechanisms for updating ODPs
is unlikely to be exercised further. Nevertheless, the
updating provision of the Montreal Protocol suggests
that policy formulation under the Climate
Convention could accommodate, via a periodic
scientific assessment process, the inevitable
improvements that will occur in the specification of
GWPs. Indeed, the sequence of IPCC reports are
illustrative examples of such updates to policy-
relevant scientific information.

Model-Dependent ODPs Acceptable. ODPs are the
product of a calculation based on a model of how
halogens interact with stratospheric ozone. Since
models are approximations of reality and since
model formulations differ, so do the ODPs that they
produce. The scatter among model results was not
considered by policy makers as a debilitating
complexity. It was simply taken as one indication of
uncertainty. Since GWP calculations are an
analogous situation, the spread of calculations from
different models could be handled in the same
fashion in formulating a recommended set of current
values.

ODP involves integrating its contribution to ozone

photochemical removal vis-a-vis biospheric uptake.
Hence, broad quantification of GWPs will be more
difficult.

* The response of the stratosphere to injection of
halocarbons is relatively rapid (time scale of the
order of five years), while many of the climate
responses to radiative forcing are much longer
(order of decades to centuries). Thus, the role of
time-scales in greenhouse gas decisions and time-
horizon choices in GWPs could be fundamental. For
example, a relatively short response time of an
affected system allows earlier observations of the
response and, in principle, more opportunity to use
such observations in policy decisions. The opposite
is true for long response times.

¢* The producers of the halocarbons are the
industrialised countries. In contrast, every country
produces and/or removes (e.g., forest sink for CO)
greenhouse gases. As a result, the spectrum of
countries that will be involved in using GWPs and in
negotiating emission reductions will be much
broader, implying more complex negotiations.

* The halocarbons are linked to a limited part of the
industrial sector. Greenhouse gases permeate many
aspects of the economies of most nations, since the
energy, transportation, and agricultural sectors are all
involved. As above, the spectrum of the industrial
sector involved in technically defining the ways in
which GWPs are used and in which emission
reductions can be accomplished will be broader, with
similar implications.

Neither the types of models used for scenario development
nor the sensitivity of input variables to government actions
were evaluated. Both of these topics can best be addressed
by comparing the different models used to compute
emission scenarios. This intercomparison requires the full
cooperation of different modelling groups and extensive
analysis, and there was neither the time nor funds available
in the evaluation for this task. The scenarios also were not

they are based “are inherently controversial because they

"The factors outlined in the Terms of Reference and the
Work Plan for Working Group III were considered, but it
must be recognised that there are no accepted criteria for
evaluating scenarios in the scientific literature.* Since
scenarios deal with the future, they cannot be compared to
observations. As an alternative, the “reasonableness” of
their input assumptions and methodology can be
examined, This can be done in part by seeking to establish
the internal consistency of various assumptions over time,
including possible interactions between assumptions such
as those that might relate the evolution of systems for
energy use, economic growth, land use and population.
“Reasonableness” can also be examined by comparing
several models in an organised intercomparison exercise.
Such an intercomparison was outside the scope of this

The set of published scenarios show a very wide range
of projected annual CO, emissions by 2100. For energy-
related CO, emissions, the extremes in the literature span a
huge range, from 1.2 to 60 GtC per year! in 2100, and
diverge greatly from 1990 to 2100. The [S92 Scenarios are
representative of the range of views found in the published
scenarios regarding energy-related CO, emissions. The
1S92 Scenarios bracket a large part of this range, spanning
from 4.6 to 34.9 GtC per year. It has been suggested by some,
however, that comparing the results of the [S92 Scenarios
is not informative, since this report has not analysed the
reasonableness of the other scenarios or their assumptions.
They further believe that the 110 year [S92 Scenarios and
the other 100 year scenarios are equally speculative.
Energy-related emissions currently dominate other types of
emissions, and are expected to do so for the next century.

The wide range of projected emissions of the IS92 and
other scenarios stems in large part from differences in

 

scenario input assumptions. For energy-related CO,
emissions, population and economic growth assumptions
usually play a key role as well as assumptions that
influence the amount of carbon-based fuels used in the
economy. For land use CO, emissions, the deforestation
rate and the carbon content of vegetation are particularly
important input assumptions. Future emission estimates
can also vary because of differences in model structures
and methods used to compute emissions. This analysis has
not examined the relative importance of modelling factors
compared to input assumptions in determining results and,
therefore, it seems unwise to draw strong conclusions.
However, EMF-12 intercomparisons? for energy CO,

"Scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions play an important
tole in the analysis of potential climate change. From a
scientific standpoint, they provide a departure point for
analysing the potential occurrence and impacts of climate
change; from a policy perspective they provide
information about the consequences of action or inaction
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Recognising the
pivotal role of these scenarios, the IPCC undertook the
development of a comprehensive and international set of
emission scenarios as part of its First Assessment (1990).
In 1992 the original reference scenario, SA90, was updated
with new information and six new reference scenarios
were developed: 1S92 a-f (reported in IPCC (1992)).

"The cumulative energy-related emissions of the
scenarios from 1990 to 2100 range from 492 to 3447
GtC (a factor of 7), which is considerably smaller
than the range of annual emissions in 2100. The
cumulative emissions of the IS92 Scenarios fall
within this range (700 to 2078 GtC).

The cumulative emissions of energy-related CO,
from 1860 to 1990 were about 215 GtC. This amount
is exceeded by even the IS92c Scenario (the lowest
IPCC scenario) which would result in energy-related
emissions of 700 GtC from 1990 to 2100.
Cumulative emissions are important for climate
analysis because CO, and other direct greenhouse
gases can affect climate for decades to centuries after
they are emitted because of the integrative nature of
the atmosphere-ocean system.

Whether or not CO, emissions will accumulate in
the atmosphere depends on many factors that are
partly taken into account by carbon cycle models.
Model calculations of this sort from Working Group
I indicate that the emissions of the IS92c Scenario
could raise atmospheric concentrations of CO, to
approximately 480 ppmv2 by 2100. Hence, even the
lowest IPCC Scenario (which would result in lower
CO, emissions in 2100 than at present) could lead to
a build-up of CO, in the atmosphere.
"	List
"Energy-related emissions currently dominate other
types of CO, emissions and will continue to do so in
the future under all scenarios considered.

Almost all published non-intervention scenarios
(including the [S92 Scenarios) show an increase in
energy-related CO, emissions over the next century.
Only one of the six IS92 Scenarios, [S92c, shows a
decline in total CO, emissions between 1990 and
2100.

For energy-related CO, emissions, the extremes in
the literature span a very wide range, from 1.2 to 60
GtC/yr in 2100. (1 GtC stands for one gigatonne
(109 tonnes) of carbon. A gigatonne is equal to a
petagram.) The IS92 Scenarios bracket a large part
of this range, spanning the range 4.6 to 34.9 GtC/yr.
The estimates of emissions diverge greatly with
time. The difference between the high and low IS92
Scenarios is less than a factor of 2 in 2025, but by
2100 it is nearly a factor of 8. The highest and lowest
non-IPCC scenarios reviewed here vary by a factor
of 3 in 2025 and a factor of 50 in 2100.

This wide range can be explained mostly by
differences in the input assumptions for the
scenarios, particularly assumptions regarding
economic and population growth, and the amount of
carbon-based fuels in the economy. Another factor is
the uncertainty of the models used to compute the
scenarios.

"Some of the uncertainty regarding future emission
projections can be attributed to the different methods and
models used to compute emissions. However, the evidence
from model comparisons indicates that model differences
explain only a small part of the wide range of emission
estimates found in the literature. Most of this range arises
from differences in the input assumptions of the scenarios.
The input assumptions that have the most effect on the
range of emission estimates are those concerning
population growth, economic growth and the amount of
carbon-based fuel in use in the economy.
"	Text
"Some of these components are specified as model
inputs, and some are derived from model
calculations.

Nearly all scenarios show a downward trend in
energy intensity. The energy intensities of the IS92
Scenarios have a narrower range than those of other
scenarios.

The carbon intensity of all IS92 Scenarios shows a
downward trend, whereas the carbon intensity of
some non-IPCC scenarios shows an upward trend.
Assumed changes in energy and carbon intensities
have an important influence on estimates of
emissions, especially in the second half of the next
century.

The range of economic growth assumptions for the
IS92 Scenarios is representative of the range in other
global scenarios (this statement applies to scenarios
"	List
"of both energy-related and land-use emissions). The
economic growth rates used for the [$92 Scenarios
are generally lower than historical rates, but would
nevertheless lead to large increases in per capita
GDP in all regions.

Recent population estimates support the plausibility
of the medium population growth rate assumed in
the IS92 Scenarios.

The IS92 Scenarios have the lowest and highest
global population growth rates of all the scenarios
reviewed. The low projection (1S92c) results in
declining global population in the 21st century.
These figures are taken from UN projections and are
not inconsistent with other recent high and low
estimates.

It is outside the scope of this report to evaluate the
various critical issues related to population
projections, such as population ageing, the Earth’s
carrying capacity, and the relationship between
economic development and demographic trends.
More research is needed to improve our
understanding of these issues so that we can better
judge the consistency and likelihood of population
projections and in turn improve our estimates of
future emissions.

In general, the components of the [S92 Scenarios are
fairly representative of other global scenarios but not
of regional scenarios. For example, the 1892
Scenarios span a much smaller range of assumptions
of future energy intensity for China and the USA
than the range found in non-IPCC scenarios. Hence
the IS92 Scenarios only represent part of the range of
regional perspectives contained in the scenarios
examined here.

In evaluating the [S92 Scenarios it is important to recall
that they were developed only to accomplish Purpose I.
The IS92 Scenarios fulfil the most important criteria for
this purpose. Specifically, their global results span the
range of results from other scenarios, and in this sense can
be said to reflect the current range of views about future
emission estimates. Moreover, the 1S92 Scenarios are
among the most comprehensive scenarios available in their
coverage of all important greenhouse gases and precursors
of ozone and sulphate aerosol. Also the scenarios are
sufficiently documented in reports and in digital form to
allow their comparison with other scenarios, and to be
used as input files for climate models. As a consequence,
they are useful for Purpose 1, namely as an input to
atmosphere/climate models for examining the
environmental/climatic consequences of not acting to

reduce greenhouse emissions.

"Net deforestation accounts for about 18% of current
total CO, emissions, and most scenarios assume that
this percentage will decline in the future.

Projected emissions of CO, resulting from
deforestation differ widely. Unlike energy-related
emissions which diverge with time, land-use
emissions have their widest range (0.2 to 4.8 GtC/yr)
before the middle of the 21st century. Most scenarios
converge to zero by the end of the century because
they project that either the forces causing
deforestation equilibrate or forests are depleted.

The IS92 Scenarios fall within the lower half of the
range of other global land-use CO, scenarios.

The range of cumulative emissions over the period
1990 to 2100 is 30 to 320 GtC. Cumulative
emissions have an upper bound set by the maximum
available amount of terrestrial biomass that could be
oxidised (about 600 GtC neglecting afforestation).

No similar upper limit is foreseen for energy-related
emissions in the next century.

The scenarios examined take a wide variety of
approaches to estimating future emissions. This
variety reflects lack of knowledge or agreement on
how best to represent emission-generating processes
related to land-use.

Not only are these processes poorly understood, but
baseline estimates differ between scenarios.
Differences in baseline estimates lead to even greater
differences in future emission estimates. Results
from studies of current emission inventories are
needed to improve these baseline estimates.

The 1S92 Scenarios do not account for the feedback
of climate to land-use emissions, and this is one
reason why their results differ from those of other
scenarios. However, climate feedbacks are quite
uncertain; thus including them in estimates of land-
use emission scenarios may or may not improve
these estimates.

In general, the 1S92 Scenarios do not cover the range

by asking for recommendations on new scenarios that
would “ serve the needs of climate modelling, planning of
response measures, and provision of information to the
Conference of Parties”. Indeed, scenarios by their nature
have both scientific and policy aspects: from a scientific
standpoint, they provide a reference point for computing
the potential occurrence and impacts of climate change;
from a policy standpoint they provide information about
the consequences of intervention or inaction to reduce

published “non-intervention” scenarios because the
1S92 Scenarios are intended to be “non-intervention”
scenarios (that is, they do not make assumptions

Thousands of input assumptions define a case in the
ASF. Fortunately, not al! assumptions are equally
important. The findings of the Energy Modelling Forum
indicate that fossil fuel carbon emissions are highly
sensitive to assumptions about the rate of improvement of
end-use energy efficiency, but relatively insensitive to the
form of the model used to generate the scenario. The
uncertainty analysis conducted by Edmonds ef al. (1986)
on the energy component of the ASF ranked the three most
important factors influencing the variation in reference
case fossil fuel CO, emissions to be labour productivity
(the prime determinant of GDP), the income elasticity of
demand for energy in the developing world (reflecting
structural change rates) and the rate of exogenous end-use
energy intensity improvement. In addition, fossil fuel CO,
emissions in the energy component of the ASF model have
been shown to be highly sensitive to the assumed costs and
supply of renewable energy sources (Edmonds et al.,
1986) as well as the environmental costs of extracting
fossil fuels.

Because population growth assumptions strongly
influence future emission projections, it would be helpful
to assess their relative likelihood. Unfortunately, this
assessment is not possible at present because of many
unresolved issues related to population projections. For
example, the feasibility of low projections is related to the
issue of a rapidly ageing population. Lutz et al. (1994)
pointed out that the ITASA low population projection for
2100 (the IS92 low projection is even lower; see Table 6.4)
is based on assumptions about low fertility and mortality
rates, and these low rates would lead to an unprecedented
ageing of the population. In its low population projection,
the percentage of the population over 60 increases in
industrialised countries from 17.4% to 44.9% between
1990 and 2100, and in developing countries it increases
from 6.9% to 40.2%. To judge the likelihood of the low
population projections of [S92 or any other scenario, it is
important to assess the response of societies to the
increasing burden of an ageing population on their social
welfare systems (see, e.g. Lutz et al. 1994).

It is interesting that the scenarios developed in the past
decade (beginning in 1983) have a narrower range of
future emission estimates than those developed in the
previous decade. Scenarios no longer anticipate emissions
of greater than 90 GtC/yr in the year 2050, as considered,
for example, by Siegenthaler and Oeschger (1978), Jason
(1979), and Bacastow and Keeling (1981). The highest
estimate of the post 1983 period projects emissions of 35
GtC/yr in the year 2050, (Lashof and Tirpak, 1990).

By the year 2100 the range of non-intervention

Future estimates of emissions diverge substantially with
time (Figure 6.1) and only resemble each other in that they
almost all increase with time. A notable exception is the
1S$92c Scenario, which declines from 1990 to 2100. For the
year 2025, the spread of non-IS92 scenario emissions
ranges from 6.7 GtC/yr in Ausubel e¢ al. (1988), to 19.8

the most studied. This interest arises because fossil fuel
CO, emissions contribute more to current and potential
future climate change than any other single gas released by
any other single human activity. CO, emissions dominate
the IS92 Scenarios (IPCC, 1992). There is also more
literature on scenarios of global fossil fuel carbon
emissions than on those of land-use emissions. This is
because the models and methods used to estimate energy-
related emissions are more detailed and advanced than
those used to compute land-use related emissions, and
because existing energy models can easily be adapted to

It is noteworthy that despite the enormous range of
tesults produced by the uncertainty analyses (Figure 6.3),
emissions almost always increase with time, with the
exception of the extremes of results. The uncertainty
analysis of Edmonds er a/. (1986) shows a range of 2 GtC

Histograms of projected emissions (Figure 6.2) show
that emission estimates are relatively closely clustered in
the year 2020, but also diverge subsequently. The
frequency of the mode also becomes smaller and smaller
with time, indicating that the scenarios agree less and less
about the central estimate of emissions. The interval that
contains each of the IS92 cases is also indicated, and
shows that the [S92 Scenarios bracket a majority of other
scenarios, but never capture their full range. This
observation is particularly apt for the year 2100.
Throughout the period, there are always scenarios with
substantially more or less fossil fuel carbon emissions than
the 1S92 Scenarios.

It should be emphasised that these results stem from
differences among models and uncertainties about input
assumptions, such as population and economic activity. By
comparison, when input assumptions are fixed between
scenarios, a much lower range of emission estimates is
found. For example, it was noted above that when key
model inputs were harmonised in the EMF-12 scenarios,
emission estimates in year 2100 varied by only a factor of
two rather than over a factor of 40, as found in the
uncertainty studies. This finding is consistent with the
recent results of de Vries et al. (1994), who only assigned
uncertainty to model input parameters, while fixing other
input assumptions such as population and economic
growth relative to a base case. As a consequence, they
computed emission estimates for the year 2050 ranging by
only a factor of about two, from 11.3 GtC to 24.4 GtC/yr
(Sth and 95th percentiles).

0.2%/yr (1990 to 2020 average), a rate that is somewhat

Two additional caveats should be noted. First, for the

purposes of this comparison, all components, not just
population and income, are treated as independent of one
another. This assumption may be inconsistent with some
models which assume that components, such as per capita
income and energy intensity are related to one another.
Second, the influence of some components on emissions
may depend on the aggregation level of the analysis
(global versus regional or national). Hence, an analysis of
the components of emissions on the global level may mask
decisive differences between regions. For this reason, the
component analysis should only be used to compare the
input assumptions and the results of different scenarios,
not, for example, to project emissions on the basis of
population growth in different regions.

In most emission scenarios, population and per capita
income growth, or their composite effect on total income,
are input assumptions. These input assumptions are
important sources of differences in projected emissions.
However, the determinants of population and per capita
income growth, and feedbacks between them are not
explicitly incorporated into emission scenarios (see section
6.2). Identifying the factors influencing population and per
capita income growth, and exploring the uncertainties
regarding their change over time, are therefore important
research tasks.

Decreases in energy intensity mitigate emission growth
in all scenarios, which is consistent with historical
observations. With a decrease in energy intensity, energy
consumption for a given population and per capita income
declines. Consequently, carbon emissions also decline.
Declining energy intensity offsets roughly one-fifth to one-
half of the effects of population and per capita income
growth, depending on the scenario. The 1S92 Scenarios
reflect a much narrower range of changes in future energy
intensity than other scenarios. This narrower range is the
most important source of the narrower range of carbon
emissions displayed in the IS92 Scenarios relative to the
range of emissions in other published scenarios.

Carbon intensity is projected to decline in all 1S92
Scenarios and the vast majority of other scenarios, further
mitigating the effects of growing population and per capita
incomes. This decline reflects a shift toward greater
reliance on energy resources that emit less carbon per unit
of energy. The offset from declining carbon intensity is
typically much less than the offset from declining energy
intensity. As in the case of energy intensity, the IS92
Scenarios display a narrower range of changes in carbon
intensity relative to other scenarios. A small number of
non-I§92 Scenarios allow for the possibility of increases in
carbon intensity over time, adding another source of
emission growth, This possibility is not allowed for in any
of the IS92 Scenarios.

The input assumptions that drive differences in energy
and carbon intensity across scenarios include different
estimates of the reserves and supply costs of carbon and
non-carbon-emitting energy resources; the income and
price elasticities of household demands for energy, the
production of energy-intensive goods and services, and
many others. A particularly important component is
technological change at both levels of energy production
and energy end use. Because of time limitations,
differences in assumptions regarding factors that influence

Most long-term scenarios (including 1$92) represent
more or less a pre-1990 “business as usual” point of view,
and that does not fully take into account the economic
crisis in EEFSU. By 2100 the published scenarios have a
range that differs by a factor of eight. One reason for this
wide spread is that both IS92c and 1S92d are beyond the
emission range of other published scenarios and are more
characteristic of policy scenarios.

are at different stages of economic and demographic
development. The USA was selected because there are a
large number of published scenarios for this region.

up to the year 2100. The IS92a, IS92b, IS92d and IS92f
scenarios are well within the 16th to 84th percentile range
of the IEW poll for 2020. The 1S92a is close to the IEW
poll median and consequently can be considered as a
“middle of the road” scenario. Conversely both 1S92e and
1892c expand the range of all other long-term (2100)
emission scenarios reviewed. I1S92e is the highest, and
1892c is the lowest of all reference scenarios analysed.

"The IS92 Scenarios do not fully capture current
perceptions about trends in energy-related emissions in
EEFSU in the medium term (up to 2020). First, the [S92
base year (1990) emission estimate (1.7 GiC/yr ) exceeds
by 30% the most recent estimate based on UN energy
statistics (1.304 GtC/yr) (Marland ef al., 1993). Second,
the assumptions in the 1S92 Scenarios about high growth
rates (particularly for GDP) are probably unrealistic
considering the current economic crisis in the region.
These assumptions lead to medium term estimates of CO,
emissions in the 1S92 Scenarios that are higher and
narrower in range than the estimates in other published
scenarios (Figure 6.7). The range of IS92 Scenarios in
2020 span from 1.8 GtC/yr to 3.0 GtC/yr, whereas the
more recent IEW poll spans a range of | to 1.6 GtC/yr by
2020. Because of uncertainty in economic trends, the range

Almost all scenarios agree that both energy and carbon
intensities will decline. The projected decline in energy
intensity ranges from 1%/yr to 2%/yr (Figure 6.8),
although there are significant differences in assumed short-
term (up to 2000) and longer-term (2020 and beyond)
trends. As indicated by results from the IEW poll, short-
term energy intensities in the region could increase. In fact,
between 1990 and 1992 the energy intensity of the former
USSR increased by 23% (ECE, 1993) as economic output
fell more rapidly than energy consumption. Over the
longer term, significant improvements in energy intensities
could occur following economic restructuring and the
replacement of inefficient capital stock and the removal of
price distortions. Current estimates of energy conservation
in the former USSR, for instance, indicate a potential of
more than 50% of actual consumption (Bashmakov, 1992
and Sinyak and Nagano, 1992). That economic
restructuring results in significant uncertainty in future
emissions is also confirmed by recent studies of other
economies in transition, ¢.g., Hungary.

"	Text
"1972C IS The lowest OF all reference scenarlos analysed,

Analysis of the components in the growth of carbon
emissions (Table 6.6) indicates the importance of
economic and population growth assumptions followed by
decreases in energy intensity. By 2100 IS92e assumes the
highest and [S92c the lowest GDP growth rates of all
scenarios reviewed. In all scenarios the intensity of energy
use decreases typically by about 1.5%/yr in reference cases
and well above 2% in policy cases (Figure 6.8). The
tesulting improvements in energy efficiency across all
scenarios are large, but within the range of both historical
experience and calculations of the theoretical minimum
requirements derived from energy analysis (cf.
Nakicenovic et al., 1993). The IS92 Scenarios have a
narrower range of assumed energy intensities than other
scenarios. Most scenarios also anticipate further
decarbonisation of the energy system, i.e. a decrease in
carbon intensity of 0.2 to 0.5%/yr (Figure 6.9). The IS92
range is lower than other reference scenarios (cf. the IEW
poll). Indeed, the low carbon intensities assumed in IS92c,
1892d and IS92e for China in the years after 2050 are more
characteristic of policy scenarios than non-intervention
Scenarios.

The upper range of the published scenarios implies a
large increase in USA emissions by 2100 (up to 3.2

unlikely in a developed, service-oriented economy such as

Although all non-intervention scenarios assume that
energy intensity declines, they do not make the same
assumption for carbon intensity. Some scenarios show a
decrease because of increased reliance on low- or no-
carbon fuels, whereas other scenarios increase carbon
intensity due to assumptions, for example, about greater
use of coal. Both IS92c and IS92d assume much lower

The range spanned by scenarios of future emissions in the

from 1.2 GtC/yr (IS92c) to 2.3 GtC/yr (e.g., IPCC-EIS or
NES, 1991). The IS92 Scenarios are skewed to the low side
(Figure 6.7). By 2100, the range of the published scenarios
widens from 0.6 GtC/yr (IS92c) to 4.5 GtC/yr (the highest
scenario from the EMF-12 model runs). The 1S92 Scenarios

The range of emission scenarios is among the widest in
both absolute and relative terms for all regions covered in
this review (Figure 6.7). By 2020 regional emissions range
from 0.3 GtC/yr to 0.8 GtC/yr, and the range increases to
0.5 GtC/yr to 5.2 GtC/yr (i.e., a factor of 10). However
even for the highest scenario, per capita carbon emissions
by 2100 would remain significantly below current OECD

assume a decline in intensity (Table 6.9 and Figure 6.8).
The range of energy intensities spanned by the IS92

up to 2020. Over the long term (2050 and beyond), there is

important gas associated with human activities, far less
attention has been paid to non-CO, greenhouse gases. In
this section we compare the IS92 Scenarios with the few
others available for energy-related CH, and N,O emissions

provide a broad range of possible future trajectories for
both CH, and N,O (Figure 6.10). By the year 2100 the
difference between the high and low cases for CH, and
N,O is similar to that for CO, (that is, a factor of about
seven or eight). Of particular importance to CH, and N,O
scenarios is the significant uncertainty in base year (1990)
emissions, which reflects gaps in data collection and gaps
in our knowledge about the processes which lead to these
emissions.

The uncertainty surrounding baseline emissions in
OECD regions is relatively small because of the
development of detailed emission inventories in
connection with air pollution control efforts. As an
example, the uncertainty about current sulphur emissions
in the USA is estimated to be only +6% to 11% (NAPAP,
1991). The baseline estimates for OECD in the IS92
emissions are close to the latest official figures. Outside
the OECD, baseline emissions are not well known because
the first comprehensive emission inventories are only now
becoming available. We note that for China the estimates

other studies consider the variety of gaseous emissions

Summary of the discussion of sensitivity analysis:
variations in the rate of GDP growth across regions which
reflect the combined population and per capita income
growth are the most important sources of variation in CO,
emissions in the near to medium term. Over time, however,
variations in the rates of change in energy and carbon
intensity are equally important to GDP growth globally
and in some regions. The sensitivity analysis did not
suggest that the 1S92a or any of the 1S92 Scenarios is a
“central” or “medium” case or has higher likelihood than
alternative scenarios. In addition, uncertainty analyses
demonstrate that emission estimates are sensitive to the
structure and processes used in models to represent the
real world. Consequently, to obtain a full range of views
about future emissions, it is also important to use a wide
range of models and methodologies.

Published uncertainty analyses also provide information
about the relative importance of different input
assumptions. We have already discussed the emission
results of four published uncertainty analyses (see Section
6.3.1.2). In this section their findings regarding the
importance of input assumptions are discussed. Nordhaus
and Yohe (1983) identified ten key input parameters to
which they assigned probability distributions. Their
analysis singled out the elasticity of substitution between
fossil and non-fossil energy use as the most important
parameter in explaining the uncertainty in carbon
emissions. They found that the rate of growth of total
factor productivity, a measure which affects both labour
and energy productivity, is the next most important
parameter. Interestingly, population assumptions were low
on the list of factors affecting baseline emissions.
Edmonds et al. (1986) obtained a similar result. However,
the range of population growth assumptions used in both
of these uncertainty studies did not encompass the current
range of population projections so their conclusions are
limited.

emission estimates and input assumptions for global energy
scenarios. However, they are not always representative of
the range of driving forces, such as population and
economic development, energy intensity and carbon
intensity, found in published regional scenarios. In some
cases the IS92 Scenarios span a much narrower range than
other scenarios. For example, the IS92 Scenarios assume a
much narrower range of energy intensities in the USA and
China plus Centrally Planned Asia than the range of
published scenarios. In other cases, the IS92 Scenarios fall
outside the range of other scenarios, for example the GDP
growth rate assumed in [$92e, which is higher for the USA
and China plus Centrally Planned Asia, than any other

Scenarios also deviate in some circumstances from the
other published scenarios, as in the case of Africa, where
the [S92 Scenarios assume increasing energy intensity up
to year 2020, even though all but one other scenario
assume a downward trend. Thus the [S92 Scenarios only
partly reflect the range of regional views expressed in the
published scenarios. Regional perspectives can be included
in global scenarios through a decentralised approach to
scenario-building which includes the participation of
scientists and policymakers familiar with national and
regional circumstances. Examples of the inclusion of
regional perspectives are the scenario-building exercises

For Asia, SCW and CW differ the most from the 1S92
Scenarios and AIM (Figure 6.16). Part of the difference may
be caused by the definition of the region, For example, the
deforestation estimates in IS92 and SCW do not include
China, but CW does. For Asia, CW peaks around 2000,
mainly because of high deforestation rates in India. Both
the 1S92 Scenarios and CW assume that wood from forest
clearings is not burned in China and the Centrally-Planned
Asian countries. Hence, deforestation in this part of Asia is
assumed to result in a low, long-term flux of carbon from
enhanced soil respiration rather than a higher short-term
flux due to wood burning of cleared forests. Thus, even
though the global results for CO, fluxes are consistent, the

The scenarios for CH, from enteric fermentation agree
on base year (1985) emissions and trends to 2000.
Subsequently, the emission estimates of the [S92 Scenarios
and SCW increase up to the end of the century, although
the SCW does so at a slower rate. By contrast, CW
emissions peak in about 2050 and decline thereafter. The
lower emissions of CW result from its assumptions about
increases in meat productivity which lead to estimates of

lower numbers of animals than the other scenarios.

For CH, from rice fields, SCW assumes a base year

SCW is close to that of the 1S92 Scenarios in that it

estimation of CO, emissions from deforestation: there are
relatively few studies to compare, and their assumptions
about deforestation rates vary considerably. However, all
scenarios agree that deforestation will diminish by the end
of the 21st century because of the equilibration of the
driving forces of deforestation or the depletion of the
forests. The carbon content of vegetation is another
important assumption in estimating CO, emissions, and
the various scenarios use a wide range of estimates for this

ranges of values based on the estimates of wood volumes

of the two methods: destructive sampling and wood-

"National projections can be used to examine the
assumptions for different regions. For example, in
Indonesia a number of different scenarios were developed
to analyse different combinations of development in rice
yields and harvested and planted rice area (DOAI, 1993).
The highest yield increase was 1.5%/yr, with an increase in
harvested area of 0.6%/yr which resulted in a 2.2%/yr
growth in rice production. The same 2.2%/yr rise in
production could also be achieved with a yield increase of
0.9%/yr combined with an increase of 1.2%/yr in
harvested area. The latter scenario was based on historical
increases in rice yield and is much less optimistic about

For regional scenarios, CW differed greatly from the
1S92 Scenarios and AIM because of its different methods
for estimating future trends in deforestation. Although
nearly all scenarios relate the deforestation rate only to
population growth, it is known that deforestation is more
precisely related to pressure on agricultural land,
consumption of wood products, settlement policy and other
socio-economic factors (Turner e¢ al. 1993). Accounting for
these factors would permit the construction of more diverse
scenarios of CO, emissions, Moreover, including these
socio-economic factors would tend to dampen the rapid
rates of deforestation found in nearly all scenarios.

No analysis of sensitivity to input assumptions is made

Lashof and Tirpak (1990) and AIM (Matsuoka and Morita,
1994). Zuidema et al. (1994) examined the sensitivity of
changes in land cover in CW to changes in crop and
animal productivity. The authors showed that deforestation
rates are more sensitive to crop yields than to animal
productivity. Table 6.10 indicates that deforestation in CW
is based on the assumption that it is driven by demand for
food and wood products. Hence, in that scenario,
deforestation depends on human population, GNP (through
income elasticities of food products) and the land’s
productivity. Land productivity is based on grid-based
maps of land cover, climate, soils and region-specific
management factors. Further sensitivity analysis should
examine all these factors.

analysis, it illustrates the simplicity of the assumptions.
The calculated CO, emissions are directly related to the
carbon content of cleared vegetation, population growth

content is specified for three forest types and for three
continents. The deforestation rates in the IS92 Scenarios

etal, (1992) for the 1S92 Scenarios. The criterion
of the internal consistency of the [S92 Scenarios could
not be evaluated because there was no access to the ASF
model.

"In our judgement, the IS92 Scenarios clearly fulfil the
criteria for Purpose 1 listed as “very important” in Table
6.14. Specifically, Sections 6.2 to 6.4 showed that the
global results and many of the input assumptions of the
1S92 Scenarios span the range of the results and
assumptions of other scenarios; in this sense it can be said
that the scenarios reflect the current range of views about
future emissions, at least on the global level. (For
particular regions, however, the 1S92 Scenarios do not
represent the range of views.) Moreover, the [S92
Scenarios are among the most comprehensive scenarios

  

  

available in their coverage of all important greenhouse
gases and precursors of ozone and sulphate aerosol. Also,
the IS92 Scenarios are sufficiently documented in reports
and in digital form to allow their comparison with other
scenarios and their use as input files for climate models.
As a consequence, they are useful for Purpose 1, namely as
input to atmosphere/climate models for examining the
environmental/climatic consequences of not acting to
reduce greenhouse emissions.

Purpose 4 is difficult to achieve at this time because of

high uncertainty about current greenhouse emissions from
many emission categories and in many countries
(especially CO, in non-energy sectors and other
greenhouse gases from virtually all sectors). This
uncertainty is one reason why the IS92 Scenarios are not
appropriate for this purpose, although they can help set the
context for negotiations by indicating the possible range of
emissions if no mitigation takes place.

   
"	Text
"The current commitments to stabilise emissions under
the Climate Convention (see Box 4) could result in large
reductions of emissions in certain regions, but on a global
basis a reduction of 10% or less (in annual emissions
relative to the IS92a Scenario) is expected in CO,
emissions. Current commitments will have no effect on the
lowest IPCC Scenario (IS92c) because emissions in this
scenario are lower than would be expected by current
commitments.

"Should one IS92 Scenario be singled out for use over
the others? In some ways 1S92a is intermediate among the
scenarios. Its global CO, emissions fall near the middle of
other scenarios at least to 2050, and some of its input
assumptions are intermediate. For example, its population
assumptions are equal or close to the medium projections
recently published by three different international
organisations. The sensitivity analysis showed, however,
that there are no strong reasons for selecting it as the
“medium case” scenario.

play a role in these activities.

"To accomplish Purpose 3 for emission scenarios
(estimation of feasibility and costs of mitigation
measures), it is important not only to analyse the costs of
emission reductions but also to assess the costs and
benefits of the impacts of emissions on the natural
environment and society, Therefore, the next generation of
emission scenarios should be coupled with their impact on
the environment and society in the form of consistent,
comprehensive and integrated scenarios for global change.
These scenarios would cover not only the trend of
emissions but also changes in the atmosphere and ocean
and the impact of these changes on society, the terrestrial
environment and the marine environment. It is
recommended that the IPCC encourages the development
of integrated scenarios.
