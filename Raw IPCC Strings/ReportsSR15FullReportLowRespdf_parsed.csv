"This IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C was formally approved by the world’s governments in 2018
— the year of IPCC’s 30"" anniversary celebrations.

"“Climate change is moving faster than we are,” said Secretary-General Guterres. “We must listen to the Earth's
best scientists,"" he added.
"	Text
"At the start of the Sixth Assessment cycle, governments, in a plenary IPCC session, decided to prepare three
special reports, including this one, and expanded the scope of this special report by framing the assessment in
the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty.
"	Text
"In his address to the UN General Assembly in 2018, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres quoted World
Meteorological Organization (WMO) data showing that the past two decades have included eighteen of the
twenty warmest years since record-keeping began in 1850.
"	Text
"Five years ago, the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report provided the scientific input into the Paris Agreement, which
aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by holding the increase in the global
average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature
increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
"	Text
"One month later the IPCC presented the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C, based on the assessment
of around 6,000 peer-review publications, most of them published in the last few years. This Special Report
confirms that climate change is already affecting people, ecosystems and livelihoods all around the world. It
shows that limiting warming to 1.5°C is possible within the laws of chemistry and physics but would require
unprecedented transitions in all aspects of society. It finds that there are clear benefits to keeping warming to
"	Text
"During its three decades of existence, the IPCC has shed light on climate change, contributing to the understanding
of its causes and consequences and the options for risk management through adaptation and mitigation. In
these three decades, global warming has continued unabated and we have witnessed an acceleration in sea-
level rise. Emissions of greenhouse gases due to human activities, the root cause of global warming, continue
to increase, year after year.
"	Text
"Many countries considered that a level of global warming close to 2°C would not be safe and, at that time, there
was only limited knowledge about the implications of a level of 1.5°C of warming for climate-related risks and
in terms of the scale of mitigation ambition and its feasibility. Parties to the Paris Agreement therefore invited
the IPCC to assess the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and the related emissions
pathways that would achieve this enhanced global ambition.
"	Text
"Sustainable development goals provide a new framework to consider climate action within the multiple
dimensions of sustainability. This report is innovative in multiple ways. It shows the importance of integration
across the traditional IPCC working groups and across disciplines within each chapter. Transitions, integrating
adaptation and mitigation for each sector, are explored within six dimensions of feasibility, showing both low
hanging fruits and barriers to overcome. It also provides scientific guidance on strategies to embed climate action
within development strategies, and how to optimize choices that maximize benefits for multiple sustainable
development dimensions and implement ethical and just transitions.

"1.5°C rather than 2°C or higher. Every bit of warming matters. And it shows that limiting warming to 1.5°C can
go hand in hand with achieving other global goals such as the Sustainable Development Agenda. Every year
matters and every choice matters.
"	Text
"The Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C supports efforts by the WMO and United Nations Environment
Programme for a comprehensive assessment of our understanding of climate change to help step up action to
respond to climate change, achieve climate-resilient development and foster an integrated approach to the
provision of climate services at all scales of governance.
"	Text
"This Special Report also shows that recent trends in emissions and the level of international ambition indicated
by nationally determined contributions, within the Paris Agreement, deviate from a track consistent with limiting
warming to well below 2°C. Without increased and urgent mitigation ambition in the coming years, leading to a
sharp decline in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, global warming will surpass 1.5°C in the following decades,

leading to irreversible loss of the most fragile ecosystems, and crisis after crisis for the most vulnerable people
and societies.

"Chapter 1 frames the context, knowledge base and assessment
approaches used to understand the impacts of 1.5°C global
warming above pre-industrial levels and related global
greenhouse gas emission pathways, building on AR5, in the
context of strengthening the global response to the threat
of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to
eradicate poverty. The chapter provides an update on the
current state of the climate system including the current level
of warming.
"	Text
"Chapter 4 discusses how the global economy and socio-
technical and socio-ecological systems can transition to
1.5°C-consistent pathways and adapt to global warming of
1.5°C. In the context of systemic transitions across energy,
land, urban and industrial systems, the chapter assesses
adaptation and mitigation options, including carbon dioxide
removal (CDR) measures, as well as the enabling conditions
that would facilitate implementing the rapid and far-reaching
global response.
"	Text
"Chapter 2 assesses the literature on mitigation pathways
that limit or return global mean warming to 1.5°C (relative
to the pre-industrial base period 1850-1900). Key questions
addressed are: What types of mitigation pathways have been
developed that could be consistent with 1.5°C? What changes
in emissions, energy and land use do they entail? What do
they imply for climate policy and implementation, and what
impacts do they have on sustainable development? This
chapter focuses on geophysical dimensions of feasibility and
the technological and economic enabling conditions.

"In its decision on the adoption of the Paris Agreement, the
Conference of Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at its 21st Session

the IPCC to provide a special report in 2018 on the impacts
of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and
related global greenhouse gas emission pathways. The Panel
accepted the invitation and placed the Report in the context
of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate
change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate
poverty.

"Chapter 3 builds on findings of AR5 and assesses new scientific
evidence of changes in the climate system and the associated
impacts on natural and human systems, with a specific focus
on the magnitude and pattern of risks for global warming
of 1.5°C above the pre-industrial period. It explores impacts
and risks for a range of natural and human systems, including
adaptation options, with a focus on how risk levels change
between today and worlds where global mean temperature
increases by 1.5°C and 2°C above pre-industrial levels. The
chapter also revisits major categories of risk (Reasons for

pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response
to the threat of climate change, sustainable development,
and efforts to eradicate poverty, is the first publication in
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth
Assessment Report (AR6). The Report was jointly prepared by
Working Groups |, Il and Ill. It is the first IPCC Report to be
collectively produced by all three Working Groups, symbolizing
the new level of integration sought between Working Groups
during AR6. The Working Group | Technical Support Unit has
been responsible for the logistical and technical support for
the preparation of the Special Report. The Special Report
builds upon the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5)
released in 2013-2014 and on relevant research subsequently
published in the scientific, technical and socio-economic
literature. It has been prepared following IPCC principles and
procedures, following AR5 guidance on calibrated language
for communicating the degree of certainty in key findings.
This Special Report is the first of three cross-Working Group
Special Reports to be published in AR6, accompanying the
three main Working Group Reports, the Synthesis Report
and a Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National
Greenhouse Gas Inventories.

"	Text
"Decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 21.

The assessment covers literature accepted for publication by 15 May 2018.

Each finding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement. A level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers: very low, low, medium, high and very high, and
typeset in italics, for example, medium confidence. The following terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or a result: virtually certain 99-100%
probability, very likely 90-100%, likely 66—100%, about as likely as not 33-66%, unlikely 0-33%, very unlikely 0-10%, exceptionally unlikely 0—1%. Additional terms (extremely likely
95-100%, more likely than not >50-100%, more unlikely than likely 0-<50%, extremely unlikely 0-5%) may also be used when appropriate. Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics,
for example, very likely. This is consistent with ARS.

See also Box SPM.1: Core Concepts Central to this Special Report.

Present level of global warming is defined as the average of a 30-year period centred on 2017 assuming the recent rate of warming continues.

This range spans the four available peer-reviewed estimates of the observed GMST change and also accounts for additional uncertainty due to possible short-term natural variability.

pre- industrial levels, with a likely range of 0.8°C to 1.2°C. Global warming is likely to reach 1.5°C
between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate. (high confidence) (Figure
SPM.1) {1.2}

 

Reflecting the long-term warming trend since pre-industrial times, observed global mean surface temperature (GMST) for
the decade 2006-2015 was 0.87°C (likely between 0.75°C and 0.99°C)® higher than the average over the 1850-1900
period (very high confidence). Estimated anthropogenic global warming matches the level of observed warming to within
+20% (likely range). Estimated anthropogenic global warming is currently increasing at 0.2°C (likely between 0.1°C and
0.3°C) per decade due to past and ongoing emissions (high confidence). {1.2.1, Table 1.1, 1.2.4}

Warming greater than the global annual average is being experienced in many land regions and seasons, including two to
three times higher in the Arctic. Warming is generally higher over land than over the ocean. (high confidence) {1.2.1, 1.2.2,
Figure 1.1, Figure 1.3, 3.3.1, 3.3.2}

Trends in intensity and frequency of some climate and weather extremes have been detected over time spans during which
about 0.5°C of global warming occurred (medium confidence). This assessment is based on several lines of evidence,
including attribution studies for changes in extremes since 1950. {3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3}

Warming from anthropogenic emissions from the pre-industrial period to the present will persist for
centuries to millennia and will continue to cause further long-term changes in the climate system,
such as sea level rise, with associated impacts (high confidence), but these emissions alone are
unlikely to cause global warming of 1.5°C (medium confidence). (Figure SPM.1) {1.2, 3.3, Figure 1.5}

Anthropogenic emissions (including greenhouse gases, aerosols and their precursors) up to the present are unlikely to
cause further warming of more than 0.5°C over the next two to three decades (high confidence) or on a century time scale
(medium confidence). {1.2.4, Figure 1.5}

Reaching and sustaining net zero global anthropogenic CO, emissions and declining net non-CO, radiative forcing would
halt anthropogenic global warming on multi-decadal time scales (high confidence). The maximum temperature reached is
then determined by cumulative net global anthropogenic CO, emissions up to the time of net zero CO, emissions (high
confidence) and the level of non-CO, radiative forcing in the decades prior to the time that maximum temperatures are
reached (medium confidence). On longer time scales, sustained net negative global anthropogenic CO, emissions and/
or further reductions in non-CO, radiative forcing may still be required to prevent further warming due to Earth system
feedbacks and to reverse ocean acidification (medium confidence) and will be required to minimize sea level rise (high
confidence). {Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1, 1.2.3, 1.2.4, Figure 1.4, 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 3.4.4.8, 3.4.5.1, 3.6.3.2}

Climate-related risks for natural and human systems are higher for global warming of 1.5°C than
at present, but lower than at 2°C (high confidence). These risks depend on the magnitude and rate
of warming, geographic location, levels of development and vulnerability, and on the choices and

Impacts on natural and human systems from global warming have already been observed (high confidence). Many land and
ocean ecosystems and some of the services they provide have already changed due to global warming (high confidence).
(Figure SPM.2) {1.4, 3.4, 3.5}

Future climate-related risks depend on the rate, peak and duration of warming. In the aggregate, they are larger if global
warming exceeds 1.5°C before returning to that level by 2100 than if global warming gradually stabilizes at 1.5°C, especially
if the peak temperature is high (e.g., about 2°C) (high confidence). Some impacts may be long-lasting or irreversible, such
as the loss of some ecosystems (high confidence). {3.2, 3.4.4, 3.6.3, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3}

Adaptation and mitigation are already occurring (high confidence). Future climate-related risks would be reduced by the
upscaling and acceleration of far-reaching, multilevel and cross-sectoral climate mitigation and by both incremental and
transformational adaptation (high confidence). {1.2, 1.3, Table 3.5, 4.2.2, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4, Box 4.2, Box

By 2100, global mean sea level rise is projected to be around 0.1 metre lower with global warming

A slower rate of sea level rise enables greater opportunities for adaptation in the human and
ecological systems of small islands, low-lying coastal areas and deltas (medium confidence).
{3.3, 3.4, 3.6}

Model-based projections of global mean sea level rise (relative to 1986-2005) suggest an indicative range of 0.26 to 0.77

A reduction of 0.1 m in global sea level rise implies that up to 10 million fewer people would be exposed to related risks,
based on population in the year 2010 and assuming no adaptation (medium confidence). {3.4.4, 3.4.5, 4.3.2}

Sea level rise will continue beyond 2100 even if global warming is limited to 1.5°C in the 21st century (high confidence).
Marine ice sheet instability in Antarctica and/or irreversible loss of the Greenland ice sheet could result in multi-metre rise

Projected Climate Change, Potential Impacts and Associated Risks

Climate models project robust’ differences in regional climate characteristics between present-day
and global warming of 1.5°C,? and between 1.5°C and 2°C.® These differences include increases
in: mean temperature in most land and ocean regions (high confidence), hot extremes in most
inhabited regions (high confidence), heavy precipitation in several regions (medium confidence),
and the probability of drought and precipitation deficits in some regions (medium confidence).
{3.3}

Evidence from attributed changes in some climate and weather extremes for a global warming of about 0.5°C supports
the assessment that an additional 0.5°C of warming compared to present is associated with further detectable changes in
these extremes (medium confidence). Several regional changes in climate are assessed to occur with global warming up
to 1.5°C compared to pre-industrial levels, including warming of extreme temperatures in many regions (high confidence),
increases in frequency, intensity, and/or amount of heavy precipitation in several regions (high confidence), and an increase
in intensity or frequency of droughts in some regions (medium confidence). {3.2, 3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.3.4, Table 3.2}

Temperature extremes on land are projected to warm more than GMST (high confidence): extreme hot days in mid-latitudes
warm by up to about 3°C at global warming of 1.5°C and about 4°C at 2°C, and extreme cold nights in high latitudes warm
by up to about 4.5°C at 1.5°C and about 6°C at 2°C (high confidence). The number of hot days is projected to increase in
most land regions, with highest increases in the tropics (high confidence). {3.3.1, 3.3.2, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3}

Risks from droughts and precipitation deficits are projected to be higher at 2°C compared to 1.5°C of global warming in
some regions (medium confidence). Risks from heavy precipitation events are projected to be higher at 2°C compared to
1.5°C of global warming in several northern hemisphere high-latitude and/or high-elevation regions, eastern Asia and
eastern North America (medium confidence). Heavy precipitation associated with tropical cyclones is projected to be
higher at 2°C compared to 1.5°C global warming (medium confidence). There is generally low confidence in projected
changes in heavy precipitation at 2°C compared to 1.5°C in other regions. Heavy precipitation when aggregated at global
scale is projected to be higher at 2°C than at 1.5°C of global warming (medium confidence). As a consequence of heavy
precipitation, the fraction of the global land area affected by flood hazards is projected to be larger at 2°C compared to
1.5°C of global warming (medium confidence). {3.3.1, 3.3.3, 3.3.4, 3.3.5, 3.3.6}

Limiting global warming to 1.5°C compared to 2°C is projected to reduce increases in ocean
temperature as well as associated increases in ocean acidity and decreases in ocean oxygen levels
(high confidence). Consequently, limiting global warming to 1.5°C is projected to reduce risks
to marine biodiversity, fisheries, and ecosystems, and their functions and services to humans,
as illustrated by recent changes to Arctic sea ice and warm-water coral reef ecosystems (high
confidence). {3.3, 3.4, 3.5, Box 3.4, Box 3.5}

There is high confidence that the probability of a sea ice-free Arctic Ocean during summer is substantially lower at global
warming of 1.5°C when compared to 2°C. With 1.5°C of global warming, one sea ice-free Arctic summer is projected per
century. This likelihood is increased to at least one per decade with 2°C global warming. Effects of a temperature overshoot
are reversible for Arctic sea ice cover on decadal time scales (high confidence). {3.3.8, 3.4.4.7}

Global warming of 1.5°C is projected to shift the ranges of many marine species to higher latitudes as well as increase the
amount of damage to many ecosystems. It is also expected to drive the loss of coastal resources and reduce the productivity of
fisheries and aquaculture (especially at low latitudes). The risks of climate-induced impacts are projected to be higher at 2°C
than those at global warming of 1.5°C (high confidence). Coral reefs, for example, are projected to decline by a further 70-90%
at 1.5°C (high confidence) with larger losses (>99%) at 2°C (very high confidence). The risk of irreversible loss of many marine
and coastal ecosystems increases with global warming, especially at 2°C or more (high confidence). {3.4.4, Box 3.4}

ecosystems and to retain more of their services to humans (high confidence). (Figure SPM..
{3.4, 3.5, Box 3.4, Box 4.2, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3}

Of 105,000 species studied,® 6% of insects, 8% of plants and 4% of vertebrates are projected to lose over half of the
climatically determined geographic range for global warming of 1.5°C, compared with 18% of insects, 16% of plants ai
8% of vertebrates for global warming of 2°C (medium confidence). Impacts associated with other biodiversity-relat
risks such as forest fires and the spread of invasive species are lower at 1.5°C compared to 2°C of global warming (hic

Approximately 4% (interquartile range 2—7%) of the global terrestrial land area is projected to undergo a transformati
of ecosystems from one type to another at 1°C of global warming, compared with 13% (interquartile range 8-20%) at 2'
(medium confidence). This indicates that the area at risk is projected to be approximately 50% lower at 1.5°C compared
2°C (medium confidence). {3.4.3.1, 3.4.3.5}

High-latitude tundra and boreal forests are particularly at risk of climate change-induced degradation and loss, with woo
shrubs already encroaching into the tundra (high confidence) and this will proceed with further warming. Limiting glob

The level of ocean acidification due to increasing CO, concentrations associated with global warming of 1.5°C is projected to
amplify the adverse effects of warming, and even further at 2°C, impacting the growth, development, calcification, survival,
and thus abundance of a broad range of species, for example, from algae to fish (high confidence). {3.3.10, 3.4.4}

Impacts of climate change in the ocean are increasing risks to fisheries and aquaculture via impacts on the physiology,
survivorship, habitat, reproduction, disease incidence, and risk of invasive species (medium confidence) but are projected to
be less at 1.5°C of global warming than at 2°C. One global fishery model, for example, projected a decrease in global annual
catch for marine fisheries of about 1.5 million tonnes for 1.5°C of global warming compared to a loss of more than 3 million
tonnes for 2°C of global warming (medium confidence). {3.4.4, Box 3.4}

Climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and
economic growth are projected to increase with global warming of 1.5°C and increase further with
2°C. (Figure SPM.2) {3.4, 3.5, 5.2, Box 3.2, Box 3.3, Box 3.5, Box 3.6, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter

Populations at disproportionately higher risk of adverse consequences with global warming of 1.5°C and beyond include
disadvantaged and vulnerable populations, some indigenous peoples, and local communities dependent on agricultural or
coastal livelihoods (high confidence). Regions at disproportionately higher risk include Arctic ecosystems, dryland regions,
small island developing states, and Least Developed Countries (high confidence). Poverty and disadvantage are expected
to increase in some populations as global warming increases; limiting global warming to 1.5°C, compared with 2°C, could
reduce the number of people both exposed to climate-related risks and susceptible to poverty by up to several hundred
million by 2050 (medium confidence). {3.4.10, 3.4.11, Box 3.5, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 3, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in

Any increase in global warming is projected to affect human health, with primarily negative consequences (high confidence).
Lower risks are projected at 1.5°C than at 2°C for heat-related morbidity and mortality (very high confidence) and for
ozone-related mortality if emissions needed for ozone formation remain high (high confidence). Urban heat islands often
amplify the impacts of heatwaves in cities (high confidence). Risks from some vector-borne diseases, such as malaria and
dengue fever, are projected to increase with warming from 1.5°C to 2°C, including potential shifts in their geographic range
(high confidence). {3.4.7, 3.4.8, 3.5.5.8}

Limiting warming to 1.5°C compared with 2°C is projected to result in smaller net reductions in yields of maize, rice, wheat,
and potentially other cereal crops, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central and South America, and
in the CO,-dependent nutritional quality of rice and wheat (high confidence). Reductions in projected food availability are
larger at 2°C than at 1.5°C of global warming in the Sahel, southern Africa, the Mediterranean, central Europe, and the
Amazon (medium confidence). Livestock are projected to be adversely affected with rising temperatures, depending on the
extent of changes in feed quality, spread of diseases, and water resource availability (high confidence). {3.4.6, 3.5.4, 3.5.5,
Box 3.1, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 3, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4}

Depending on future socio-economic conditions, limiting global warming to 1.5°C compared to 2°C may reduce the
proportion of the world population exposed to a climate change-induced increase in water stress by up to 50%, although
there is considerable variability between regions (medium confidence). Many small island developing states could
experience lower water stress as a result of projected changes in aridity when global warming is limited to 1.5°C, as
compared to 2°C (medium confidence). {3.3.5, 3.4.2, 3.4.8, 3.5.5, Box 3.2, Box 3.5, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4}

Risks to global aggregated economic growth due to climate change impacts are projected to be lower at 1.5°C than at
2°C by the end of this century’? (medium confidence). This excludes the costs of mitigation, adaptation investments and
the benefits of adaptation. Countries in the tropics and Southern Hemisphere subtropics are projected to experience the
largest impacts on economic growth due to climate change should global warming increase from 1.5°C to 2°C (medium
confidence). {3.5.2, 3.5.3}

Exposure to multiple and compound climate-related risks increases between 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming, with greater
proportions of people both so exposed and susceptible to poverty in Africa and Asia (high confidence). For global warming
from 1.5°C to 2°C, risks across energy, food, and water sectors could overlap spatially and temporally, creating new and
exacerbating current hazards, exposures, and vulnerabilities that could affect increasing numbers of people and regions
(medium confidence). {Box 3.5, 3.3.1, 3.4.5.3, 3.4.5.6, 3.4.11, 3.5.4.9}

There are multiple lines of evidence that since AR5 the assessed levels of risk increased for four of the five Reasons for
Concern (RFCs) for global warming to 2°C (high confidence). The risk transitions by degrees of global warming are now:
from high to very high risk between 1.5°C and 2°C for RFC1 (Unique and threatened systems) (high confidence); from
moderate to high risk between 1°C and 1.5°C for RFC2 (Extreme weather events) (medium confidence); from moderate to
high risk between 1.5°C and 2°C for RFC3 (Distribution of impacts) (high confidence); from moderate to high risk between
1.5°C and 2.5°C for RFC4 (Global aggregate impacts) (medium confidence); and from moderate to high risk between 1°C
and 2.5°C for RFC5 (Large-scale singular events) (medium confidence). (Figure SPM.2) {3.4.13; 3.5, 3.5.2}

Most adaptation needs will be lower for global warming of 1.5°C compared to 2°C (high confidence).
There are a wide range of adaptation options that can reduce the risks of climate change (high
confidence). There are limits to adaptation and adaptive capacity for some human and natural
systems at global warming of 1.5°C, with associated losses (medium confidence). The number and
availability of adaptation options vary by sector (medium confidence). {Table 3.5, 4.3, 4.5, Cross-
Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4, Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5}

A wide range of adaptation options are available to reduce the risks to natural and managed ecosystems (e.g., ecosystem-
based adaptation, ecosystem restoration and avoided degradation and deforestation, biodiversity management,
sustainable aquaculture, and local knowledge and indigenous knowledge), the risks of sea level rise (e.g., coastal defence
and hardening), and the risks to health, livelihoods, food, water, and economic growth, especially in rural landscapes
(e.g., efficient irrigation, social safety nets, disaster risk management, risk spreading and sharing, and community-
based adaptation) and urban areas (e.g., green infrastructure, sustainable land use and planning, and sustainable water
management) (medium confidence). {4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.3.3, 4.3.5, 4.5.3, 4.5.4, 5.3.2, Box 4.2, Box 4.3, Box 4.6, Cross-Chapter
Box 9 in Chapter 4}.

Adaptation is expected to be more challenging for ecosystems, food and health systems at 2°C of global warming than for
1.5°C (medium confidence). Some vulnerable regions, including small islands and Least Developed Countries, are projected
to experience high multiple interrelated climate risks even at global warming of 1.5°C (high confidence). {3.3.1, 3.4.5,

Emission Pathways and System Transitions Consistent with 1.5°C
Global Warming

In model pathways with no or limited overshoot of 1.5°C, global net anthropogenic CO, emissions
decline by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 (40-60% interquartile range), reaching net zero
around 2050 (2045-2055 interquartile range). For limiting global warming to below 2°C"" CO,
emissions are projected to decline by about 25% by 2030 in most pathways (10-30% interquartile
range) and reach net zero around 2070 (2065-2080 interquartile range). Non-CO, emissions in
pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C show deep reductions that are similar to those in
pathways limiting warming to 2°C. (high confidence) (Figure SPM.3a) {2.1, 2.3, Table 2.4}

CO, emissions reductions that limit global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot can involve different portfolios of
mitigation measures, striking different balances between lowering energy and resource intensity, rate of decarbonization,
and the reliance on carbon dioxide removal. Different portfolios face different implementation challenges and potential
synergies and trade-offs with sustainable development. (high confidence) (Figure SPM.3b) {2.3.2, 2.3.4, 2.4, 2.5.3}

Modelled pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot involve deep reductions in emissions
of methane and black carbon (35% or more of both by 2050 relative to 2010). These pathways also reduce most of the
cooling aerosols, which partially offsets mitigation effects for two to three decades. Non-CO, emissions’? can be reduced
as a result of broad mitigation measures in the energy sector. In addition, targeted non-CO, mitigation measures can
reduce nitrous oxide and methane from agriculture, methane from the waste sector, some sources of black carbon, and
hydrofluorocarbons. High bioenergy demand can increase emissions of nitrous oxide in some 1.5°C pathways, highlighting
the importance of appropriate management approaches. Improved air quality resulting from projected reductions in many
non-CO, emissions provide direct and immediate population health benefits in all 1.5°C model pathways. (high confidence)
(Figure SPM.3a) {2.2.1, 2.3.3, 2.4.4, 2.5.3, 4.3.6, 5.4.2}

Limiting global warming requires limiting the total cumulative global anthropogenic emissions of CO, since the pre-
industrial period, that is, staying within a total carbon budget (high confidence).'3 By the end of 2017, anthropogenic CO,
emissions since the pre-industrial period are estimated to have reduced the total carbon budget for 1.5°C by approximately
2200 + 320 GtCO, (medium confidence). The associated remaining budget is being depleted by current emissions of
42 + 3 GtCO, per year (high confidence). The choice of the measure of global temperature affects the estimated remaining
carbon budget. Using global mean surface air temperature, as in AR5, gives an estimate of the remaining carbon budget of
580 GtCO, for a 50% probability of limiting warming to 1.5°C, and 420 GtCO, for a 66% probability (medium confidence).'
Alternatively, using GMST gives estimates of 770 and 570 GtCO,, for 50% and 66% probabilities,'> respectively (medium
confidence). Uncertainties in the size of these estimated remaining carbon budgets are substantial and depend on several
factors. Uncertainties in the climate response to CO, and non-CO, emissions contribute +400 GtCO, and the level of historic
warming contributes +250 GtCO, (medium confidence). Potential additional carbon release from future permafrost thawing
and methane release from wetlands would reduce budgets by up to 100 GtCO, over the course of this century and more
thereafter (medium confidence). In addition, the level of non-CO, mitigation in the future could alter the remaining carbon
budget by 250 GtCO, in either direction (medium confidence). {1.2.4, 2.2.2, 2.6.1, Table 2.2, Chapter 2 Supplementary

Solar radiation modification (SRM) measures are not included in any of the available assessed pathways. Although some
SRM measures may be theoretically effective in reducing an overshoot, they face large uncertainties and knowledge gaps

Pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot would require rapid
and far-reaching transitions in energy, land, urban and infrastructure (including transport and
buildings), and industrial systems (high confidence). These systems transitions are unprecedented
in terms of scale, but not necessarily in terms of speed, and imply deep emissions reductions in all
sectors, a wide portfolio of mitigation options and a significant upscaling of investments in those
options (medium confidence). {2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5}

Pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot show system changes that are more rapid and
pronounced over the next two decades than in 2°C pathways (high confidence). The rates of system changes associated
with limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot have occurred in the past within specific sectors,
technologies and spatial contexts, but there is no documented historic precedent for their scale (medium confidence).
{2.3.3, 2.3.4, 2.4, 2.5, 4.2.1, 4.2.2, Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4}

In energy systems, modelled global pathways (considered in the literature) limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or
limited overshoot (for more details see Figure SPM.3b) generally meet energy service demand with lower energy use,
including through enhanced energy efficiency, and show faster electrification of energy end use compared to 2°C (high
confidence). In 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot, low-emission energy sources are projected to have a higher
share, compared with 2°C pathways, particularly before 2050 (high confidence). In 1.5°C pathways with no or limited
overshoot, renewables are projected to supply 70-85% (interquartile range) of electricity in 2050 (high confidence). In
electricity generation, shares of nuclear and fossil fuels with carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) are modelled to
increase in most 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot. In modelled 1.5°C pathways with limited or no overshoot,
the use of CCS would allow the electricity generation share of gas to be approximately 8% (3—-11% interquartile range)
of global electricity in 2050, while the use of coal shows a steep reduction in all pathways and would be reduced to close
to 0% (0-2% interquartile range) of electricity (high confidence). While acknowledging the challenges, and differences
between the options and national circumstances, political, economic, social and technical feasibility of solar energy, wind
energy and electricity storage technologies have substantially improved over the past few years (high confidence). These
improvements signal a potential system transition in electricity generation. (Figure SPM.3b) {2.4.1, 2.4.2, Figure 2.1, Table
2.6, Table 2.7, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 3, 4.2.1, 4.3.1, 4.3.3, 4.5.2}

CO, emissions from industry in pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot are projected to
be about 65-90% (interquartile range) lower in 2050 relative to 2010, as compared to 50-80% for global warming of
2°C (medium confidence). Such reductions can be achieved through combinations of new and existing technologies and
practices, including electrification, hydrogen, sustainable bio-based feedstocks, product substitution, and carbon capture,
utilization and storage (CCUS). These options are technically proven at various scales but their large-scale deployment
may be limited by economic, financial, human capacity and institutional constraints in specific contexts, and specific
characteristics of large-scale industrial installations. In industry, emissions reductions by energy and process efficiency
by themselves are insufficient for limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot (high confidence). {2.4.3, 4.2.1,
Table 4.1, Table 4.3, 4.3.3, 4.3.4, 4.5.2}

The urban and infrastructure system transition consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot
would imply, for example, changes in land and urban planning practices, as well as deeper emissions reductions in transport
and buildings compared to pathways that limit global warming below 2°C (medium confidence). Technical measures
"	List
"and practices enabling deep emissions reductions include various energy efficiency options. In pathways limiting global
warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, the electricity share of energy demand in buildings would be about 55-75%
in 2050 compared to 50-70% in 2050 for 2°C global warming (medium confidence). In the transport sector, the share of
low-emission final energy would rise from less than 5% in 2020 to about 35-65% in 2050 compared to 25-45% for 2°C
of global warming (medium confidence). Economic, institutional and socio-cultural barriers may inhibit these urban and
infrastructure system transitions, depending on national, regional and local circumstances, capabilities and the availability
of capital (high confidence). {2.3.4, 2.4.3, 4.2.1, Table 4.1, 4.3.3, 4.5.2}

Transitions in global and regional land use are found in all pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited
overshoot, but their scale depends on the pursued mitigation portfolio. Model pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C
with no or limited overshoot project a 4 million km? reduction to a 2.5 million km? increase of non-pasture agricultural land
for food and feed crops and a 0.5-11 million km? reduction of pasture land, to be converted into a 0-6 million km? increase
of agricultural land for energy crops and a 2 million km? reduction to 9.5 million km? increase in forests by 2050 relative
to 2010 (medium confidence).'® Land-use transitions of similar magnitude can be observed in modelled 2°C pathways
(medium confidence). Such large transitions pose profound challenges for sustainable management of the various demands
on land for human settlements, food, livestock feed, fibre, bioenergy, carbon storage, biodiversity and other ecosystem
services (high confidence). Mitigation options limiting the demand for land include sustainable intensification of land-use
practices, ecosystem restoration and changes towards less resource-intensive diets (high confidence). The implementation
of land-based mitigation options would require overcoming socio-economic, institutional, technological, financing and
environmental barriers that differ across regions (high confidence). {2.4.4, Figure 2.24, 4.3.2, 4.3.7, 4.5.2, Cross-Chapter
Box 7 in Chapter 3}

Additional annual average energy-related investments for the period 2016 to 2050 in pathways limiting warming to
1.5°C compared to pathways without new climate policies beyond those in place today are estimated to be around 830
billion USD2010 (range of 150 billion to 1700 billion USD2010 across six models’). This compares to total annual average
energy supply investments in 1.5°C pathways of 1460 to 3510 billion USD2010 and total annual average energy demand
investments of 640 to 910 billion USD2010 for the period 2016 to 2050. Total energy-related investments increase by
about 12% (range of 3% to 24%) in 1.5°C pathways relative to 2°C pathways. Annual investments in low-carbon energy
technologies and energy efficiency are upscaled by roughly a factor of six (range of factor of 4 to 10) by 2050 compared to
2015 (medium confidence). {2.5.2, Box 4.8, Figure 2.27}

Modelled pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot project a wide range of global average
discounted marginal abatement costs over the 21st century. They are roughly 3-4 times higher than in pathways limiting
global warming to below 2°C (high confidence). The economic literature distinguishes marginal abatement costs from total
mitigation costs in the economy. The literature on total mitigation costs of 1.5°C mitigation pathways is limited and was
not assessed in this Report. Knowledge gaps remain in the integrated assessment of the economy-wide costs and benefits
of mitigation in line with pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C. {2.5.2; 2.6; Figure 2.26}

All pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C with limited or no overshoot project the use of
carbon dioxide removal (CDR) on the order of 100-1000 GtCO, over the 21st century. CDR would
be used to compensate for residual emissions and, in most cases, achieve net negative emissions
to return global warming to 1.5°C following a peak (high confidence). CDR deployment of several
hundreds of GtCO, is subject to multiple feasibility and sustainability constraints (high confidence).
Significant near-term emissions reductions and measures to lower energy and land demand can
limit CDR deployment to a few hundred GtCO, without reliance on bioenergy with carbon capture
and storage (BECCS) (high confidence). {2.3, 2.4, 3.6.2, 4.3, 5.4}

Existing and potential CDR measures include afforestation and reforestation, land restoration and soil carbon sequestration,
BECCS, direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), enhanced weathering and ocean alkalinization. These differ widely
in terms of maturity, potentials, costs, risks, co-benefits and trade-offs (high confidence). To date, only a few published
pathways include CDR measures other than afforestation and BECCS. {2.3.4, 3.6.2, 4.3.2, 4.3.7}

In pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C with limited or no overshoot, BECCS deployment is projected to range from
0-1, 0-8, and 0-16 GtCO, yr-' in 2030, 2050, and 2100, respectively, while agriculture, forestry and land-use (AFOLU)
related CDR measures are projected to remove 0-5, 1-11, and 1-5 GtCO, yr-' in these years (medium confidence). The
upper end of these deployment ranges by mid-century exceeds the BECCS potential of up to 5 GtCO, yr-' and afforestation
potential of up to 3.6 GtCO, yr-' assessed based on recent literature (medium confidence). Some pathways avoid BECCS
deployment completely through demand-side measures and greater reliance on AFOLU-related CDR measures (medium
confidence). The use of bioenergy can be as high or even higher when BECCS is excluded compared to when it is included
due to its potential for replacing fossil fuels across sectors (high confidence). (Figure SPM.3b) {2.3.3, 2.3.4, 2.4.2, 3.6.2,
4.3.1, 4.2.3, 4.3.2, 4.3.7, 4.4.3, Table 2.4}

Pathways that overshoot 1.5°C of global warming rely on CDR exceeding residual CO, emissions later in the century to
return to below 1.5°C by 2100, with larger overshoots requiring greater amounts of CDR (Figure SPM.3b) (high confidence).
Limitations on the speed, scale, and societal acceptability of CDR deployment hence determine the ability to return global
warming to below 1.5°C following an overshoot. Carbon cycle and climate system understanding is still limited about the
effectiveness of net negative emissions to reduce temperatures after they peak (high confidence). {2.2, 2.3.4, 2.3.5, 2.6,
4.3.7, 4.5.2, Table 4.11}

Most current and potential CDR measures could have significant impacts on land, energy, water or nutrients if deployed
at large scale (high confidence). Afforestation and bioenergy may compete with other land uses and may have significant
impacts on agricultural and food systems, biodiversity, and other ecosystem functions and services (high confidence).
Effective governance is needed to limit such trade-offs and ensure permanence of carbon removal in terrestrial, geological
and ocean reservoirs (high confidence). Feasibility and sustainability of CDR use could be enhanced by a portfolio of options
deployed at substantial, but lesser scales, rather than a single option at very large scale (high confidence). (Figure SPM.3b)
{2.3.4, 2.4.4, 2.5.3, 2.6, 3.6.2, 4.3.2, 4.3.7, 4.5.2, 5.4.1, 5.4.2; Cross-Chapter Boxes 7 and 8 in Chapter 3, Table 4.11, Table
5.3, Figure 5.3}

Some AFOLU-related CDR measures such as restoration of natural ecosystems and soil carbon sequestration could provide
co-benefits such as improved biodiversity, soil quality, and local food security. If deployed at large scale, they would
require governance systems enabling sustainable land management to conserve and protect land carbon stocks and other
ecosystem functions and services (medium confidence). (Figure SPM.A) {2.3.3, 2.3.4, 2.4.2, 2.4.4, 3.6.2, 5.4.1, Cross-Chapter

in the medium to long term (high confidence). These may increase uneven distributional impacts between countries at
different stages of development (medium confidence). {2.3.5, 4.4.5, 5.4.2}

The avoided climate change impacts on sustainable development, eradication of poverty and reducing
inequalities would be greater if global warming were limited to 1.5°C rather than 2°C, if mitigation
and adaptation synergies are maximized while trade-offs are minimized (high confidence). {1.1, 1.4,
2.5, 3.3, 3.4, 5.2, Table 5.1}

Climate change impacts and responses are closely linked to sustainable development which balances social well-being,
economic prosperity and environmental protection. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted in
2015, provide an established framework for assessing the links between global warming of 1.5°C or 2°C and development
goals that include poverty eradication, reducing inequalities, and climate action. (high confidence) {Cross-Chapter Box 4 in
Chapter 1, 1.4, 5.1}

The consideration of ethics and equity can help address the uneven distribution of adverse impacts associated with

Strengthening the Global Response in the Context of Sustainable
Development and Efforts to Eradicate Poverty

Estimates of the global emissions outcome of current nationally stated mitigation ambitions as
submitted under the Paris Agreement would lead to global greenhouse gas emissions'® in 2030
of 52-58 GtCO,eq yr-' (medium confidence). Pathways reflecting these ambitions would not limit
global warming to 1.5°C, even if supplemented by very challenging increases in the scale and
ambition of emissions reductions after 2030 (high confidence). Avoiding overshoot and reliance
on future large-scale deployment of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) can only be achieved if global
CO, emissions start to decline well before 2030 (high confidence). {1.2, 2.3, 3.3, 3.4, 4.2, 4.4, Cross-
Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4}

Pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot show clear emission reductions by 2030 (high
confidence). All but one show a decline in global greenhouse gas emissions to below 35 GtCO,eq yr-! in 2030, and half of
available pathways fall within the 25-30 GtCO,eq yr-! range (interquartile range), a 40-50% reduction from 2010 levels
(high confidence). Pathways reflecting current nationally stated mitigation ambition until 2030 are broadly consistent
with cost-effective pathways that result in a global warming of about 3°C by 2100, with warming continuing afterwards
(medium confidence). {2.3.3, 2.3.5, Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4, 5.5.3.2}

Overshoot trajectories result in higher impacts and associated challenges compared to pathways that limit global warming
to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot (high confidence). Reversing warming after an overshoot of 0.2°C or larger during
this century would require upscaling and deployment of CDR at rates and volumes that might not be achievable given
considerable implementation challenges (medium confidence). {1.3.3, 2.3.4, 2.3.5, 2.5.1, 3.3, 4.3.7, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in
Chapter 3, Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4}

The lower the emissions in 2030, the lower the challenge in limiting global warming to 1.5°C after 2030 with no or limited
overshoot (high confidence). The challenges from delayed actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions include the risk of
cost escalation, lock-in in carbon-emitting infrastructure, stranded assets, and reduced flexibility in future response options
in the medium to long term (high confidence). These may increase uneven distributional impacts between countries at
different stages of development (medium confidence). {2.3.5, 4.4.5, 5.4.2}

The avoided climate change impacts on sustainable development, eradication of poverty and reducing
inequalities would be greater if global warming were limited to 1.5°C rather than 2°C, if mitigation
and adaptation synergies are maximized while trade-offs are minimized (high confidence). {1.1, 1.4,
2.5, 3.3, 3.4, 5.2, Table 5.1}

Climate change impacts and responses are closely linked to sustainable development which balances social well-being,

Mitigation options consistent with 1.5°C pathways are associated with multiple synergies and trade-
offs across the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). While the total number of possible synergies
exceeds the number of trade-offs, their net effect will depend on the pace and magnitude of changes,
the composition of the mitigation portfolio and the management of the transition. (high confidence)
(Figure SPM.4) {2.5, 4.5, 5.4}

1.5°C pathways have robust synergies particularly for the SDGs 3 (health), 7 (clean energy), 11 (cities and communities), 12
(responsible consumption and production) and 14 (oceans) (very high confidence). Some 1.5°C pathways show potential
trade-offs with mitigation for SDGs 1 (poverty), 2 (hunger), 6 (water) and 7 (energy access), if not managed carefully (high
confidence). (Figure SPM.4) {5.4.2; Figure 5.4, Cross-Chapter Boxes 7 and 8 in Chapter 3}

1.5°C pathways that include low energy demand (e.g., see P1 in Figure SPM.3a and SPM.3b), low material consumption,
and low GHG-intensive food consumption have the most pronounced synergies and the lowest number of trade-offs with
respect to sustainable development and the SDGs (high confidence). Such pathways would reduce dependence on CDR. In
modelled pathways, sustainable development, eradicating poverty and reducing inequality can support limiting warming to
1.5°C (high confidence). (Figure SPM.3b, Figure SPM.4) {2.4.3, 2.5.1, 2.5.3, Figure 2.4, Figure 2.28, 5.4.1, 5.4.2, Figure 5.4}

conditions, will have benefits for sustainable development and poverty reduction with global
warming of 1.5°C, although trade-offs are possible (high confidence). {1.4, 4.3, 4.5}

Adaptation options that reduce the vulnerability of human and natural systems have many synergies with sustainable
development, if well managed, such as ensuring food and water security, reducing disaster risks, improving health
conditions, maintaining ecosystem services and reducing poverty and inequality (high confidence). Increasing investment
in physical and social infrastructure is a key enabling condition to enhance the resilience and the adaptive capacities
of societies. These benefits can occur in most regions with adaptation to 1.5°C of global warming (high confidence).
{1.4.3, 4.2.2, 4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.3.3, 4.3.5, 4.4.1, 4.4.3, 4.5.3, 5.3.1, 5.3.2}

Adaptation to 1.5°C global warming can also result in trade-offs or maladaptations with adverse impacts for sustainable
development. For example, if poorly designed or implemented, adaptation projects in a range of sectors can increase
greenhouse gas emissions and water use, increase gender and social inequality, undermine health conditions, and encroach
on natural ecosystems (high confidence). These trade-offs can be reduced by adaptations that include attention to poverty
and sustainable development (high confidence). {4.3.2, 4.3.3, 4.5.4, 5.3.2; Cross-Chapter Boxes 6 and 7 in Chapter 3}

A mix of adaptation and mitigation options to limit global warming to 1.5°C, implemented in a participatory and integrated
manner, can enable rapid, systemic transitions in urban and rural areas (high confidence). These are most effective when
aligned with economic and sustainable development, and when local and regional governments and decision makers are
supported by national governments (medium confidence). {4.3.2, 4.3.3, 4.4.1, 4.4.2}

Adaptation options that also mitigate emissions can provide synergies and cost savings in most sectors and system
transitions, such as when land management reduces emissions and disaster risk, or when low-carbon buildings are also
designed for efficient cooling. Trade-offs between mitigation and adaptation, when limiting global warming to 1.5°C,
such as when bioenergy crops, reforestation or afforestation encroach on land needed for agricultural adaptation, can
undermine food security, livelihoods, ecosystem functions and services and other aspects of sustainable development. (high
confidence) {3.4.3, 4.3.2, 4.3.4, 4.4.1, 4.5.2, 4.5.3, 4.5.4}

"Information about the net impacts of mitigation on sustainable development in 1.5°C pathways is available only for a limited number of SDGs and mitigation
options. Only a limited number of studies have assessed the benefits of avoided climate change impacts of 1.5°C pathways for the SDGs, and the co-effects
of adaptation for mitigation and the SDGs. The assessment of the indicative mitigation potentials in Figure SPM.4 is a step further from ARS towards a more
comprehensive and integrated assessment in the future.

"Figure SPM.4| Potential synergies and trade-offs between the sectoral portfolio of climate change mitigation options and the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs). The SDGs serve as an analytical framework for the assessment of the different sustainable development dimensions, which extend beyond the time frame
of the 2030 SDG targets. The assessment is based on literature on mitigation options that are considered relevant for 1.5°C. The assessed strength of the SDG
interactions is based on the qualitative and quantitative assessment of individual mitigation options listed in Table 5.2. For each mitigation option, the strength of
the SDG-connection as well as the associated confidence of the underlying literature (shades of green and red) was assessed. The strength of positive connections
(synergies) and negative connections (trade-offs) across all individual options within a sector (see Table 5.2) are aggregated into sectoral potentials for the whole
mitigation portfolio. The (white) areas outside the bars, which indicate no interactions, have /ow confidence due to the uncertainty and limited number of studies
exploring indirect effects. The strength of the connection considers only the effect of mitigation and does not include benefits of avoided impacts. SDG 13 (climate
action) is not listed because mitigation is being considered in terms of interactions with SDGs and not vice versa. The bars denote the strength of the connection,
and do not consider the strength of the impact on the SDGs. The energy demand sector comprises behavioural responses, fuel switching and efficiency options in
the transport, industry and building sector as well as carbon capture options in the industry sector. Options assessed in the energy supply sector comprise biomass
and non-biomass renewables, nuclear, carbon capture and storage (CCS) with bioenergy, and CCS with fossil fuels. Options in the land sector comprise agricultural
and forest options, sustainable diets and reduced food waste, soil sequestration, livestock and manure management, reduced deforestation, afforestation and
reforestation, and responsible sourcing. In addition to this figure, options in the ocean sector are discussed in the underlying report. {5.4, Table 5.2, Figure 5.2}

1.5°C and 2°C modelled pathways often rely on the deployment of large-scale land-related measures like afforestation
and bioenergy supply, which, if poorly managed, can compete with food production and hence raise food security concerns
(high confidence). The impacts of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) options on SDGs depend on the type of options and the
scale of deployment (high confidence). If poorly implemented, CDR options such as BECCS and AFOLU options would lead
to trade-offs. Context-relevant design and implementation requires considering people’s needs, biodiversity, and other
sustainable development dimensions (very high confidence). (Figure SPM.4) {5.4.1.3, Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3}

Mitigation consistent with 1.5°C pathways creates risks for sustainable development in regions with high dependency on
fossil fuels for revenue and employment generation (high confidence). Policies that promote diversification of the economy
and the energy sector can address the associated challenges (high confidence). {5.4.1.2, Box 5.2}

Redistributive policies across sectors and populations that shield the poor and vulnerable can resolve trade-offs for a range
of SDGs, particularly hunger, poverty and energy access. Investment needs for such complementary policies are only a small
fraction of the overall mitigation investments in 1.5°C pathways. (high confidence) {2.4.3, 5.4.2, Figure 5.5}

Limiting the risks from global warming of 1.5°C in the context of sustainable development and
poverty eradication implies system transitions that can be enabled by an increase of adaptation
and mitigation investments, policy instruments, the acceleration of technological innovation and
behaviour changes (high confidence). {2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 3.2, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 5.2, 5.5, 5.6}

Directing finance towards investment in infrastructure for mitigation and adaptation could provide additional resources.
This could involve the mobilization of private funds by institutional investors, asset managers and development or
investment banks, as well as the provision of public funds. Government policies that lower the risk of low-emission and
adaptation investments can facilitate the mobilization of private funds and enhance the effectiveness of other public
policies. Studies indicate a number of challenges, including access to finance and mobilization of funds. (high confidence)
{2.5.1, 2.5.2, 4.4.5}

Adaptation finance consistent with global warming of 1.5°C is difficult to quantify and compare with 2°C. Knowledge
gaps include insufficient data to calculate specific climate resilience-enhancing investments from the provision of currently
underinvested basic infrastructure. Estimates of the costs of adaptation might be lower at global warming of 1.5°C than for
2°C. Adaptation needs have typically been supported by public sector sources such as national and subnational government
budaets. and in developing countries together with support from development assistance. multilateral develooment banks,

Sustainable development supports, and often enables, the fundamental societal and systems
transitions and transformations that help limit global warming to 1.5°C. Such changes facilitate the
pursuit of climate-resilient development pathways that achieve ambitious mitigation and adaptation
in conjunction with poverty eradication and efforts to reduce inequalities (high confidence). {Box 1.1,
1.4.3, Figure 5.1, 5.5.3, Box 5.3}

Social justice and equity are core aspects of climate-resilient development pathways that aim to limit global warming to
1.5°C as they address challenges and inevitable trade-offs, widen opportunities, and ensure that options, visions, and values
are deliberated, between and within countries and communities, without making the poor and disadvantaged worse off
(high confidence). {5.5.2, 5.5.3, Box 5.3, Figure 5.1, Figure 5.6, Cross-Chapter Boxes 12 and 13 in Chapter 5}

The potential for climate-resilient development pathways differs between and within regions and nations, due to different
development contexts and systemic vulnerabilities (very high confidence). Efforts along such pathways to date have been
limited (medium confidence) and enhanced efforts would involve strengthened and timely action from all countries and
non-state actors (high confidence). {5.5.1, 5.5.3, Figure 5.1}

Pathways that are consistent with sustainable development show fewer mitigation and adaptation challenges and are
associated with lower mitigation costs. The large majority of modelling studies could not construct pathways characterized
by lack of international cooperation, inequality and poverty that were able to limit global warming to 1.5°C. (high

(medium confidence). Barriers include the scale of adaptation financing, limited capacity and access to adaptation finance
(medium confidence). {4.4.5, 4.6}

Global model pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C are projected to involve the annual average investment needs
in the energy system of around 2.4 trillion USD2010 between 2016 and 2035, representing about 2.5% of the world GDP
(medium confidence). {4.4.5, Box 4.8}

Policy tools can help mobilize incremental resources, including through shifting global investments and savings and
through market and non-market based instruments as well as accompanying measures to secure the equity of the
transition, acknowledging the challenges related with implementation, including those of energy costs, depreciation of
assets and impacts on international competition, and utilizing the opportunities to maximize co-benefits (high confidence).
{1.3.3, 2.3.4, 2.3.5, 2.5.1, 2.5.2, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3, Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4, 4.4.5, 5.5.2}

The systems transitions consistent with adapting to and limiting global warming to 1.5°C include the widespread adoption
of new and possibly disruptive technologies and practices and enhanced climate-driven innovation. These imply enhanced
technological innovation capabilities, including in industry and finance. Both national innovation policies and international
cooperation can contribute to the development, commercialization and widespread adoption of mitigation and adaptation
technologies. Innovation policies may be more effective when they combine public support for research and development
with policy mixes that provide incentives for technology diffusion. (high confidence) {4.4.4, 4.4.5}.

Education, information, and community approaches, including those that are informed by indigenous knowledge and local
knowledge, can accelerate the wide-scale behaviour changes consistent with adapting to and limiting global warming to
1.5°C. These approaches are more effective when combined with other policies and tailored to the motivations, capabilities
and resources of specific actors and contexts (high confidence). Public acceptability can enable or inhibit the implementation
of policies and measures to limit global warming to 1.5°C and to adapt to the consequences. Public acceptability depends
on the individual's evaluation of expected policy consequences, the perceived fairness of the distribution of these
consequences, and perceived fairness of decision procedures (high confidence). {1.1, 1.5, 4.3.5, 4.4.1, 4.4.3, Box 4.3, 5.5.3,

Strengthening the capacities for climate action of national and sub-national authorities, civil society,

people, in the context of sustainable development. International cooperation is a critical enabler for
developing countries and vulnerable regions (high confidence). {1.4, 2.3, 2.5, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5,

Partnerships involving non-state public and private actors, institutional investors, the banking system, civil society and
scientific institutions would facilitate actions and responses consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C (very high
confidence). {1.4, 4.4.1, 4.2.2, 4.4.3, 4.4.5, 4.5.3, 5.4.1, 5.6.2, Box 5.3}.

Cooperation on strengthened accountable multilevel governance that includes non-state actors such as industry, civil
society and scientific institutions, coordinated sectoral and cross-sectoral policies at various governance levels, gender-
sensitive policies, finance including innovative financing, and cooperation on technology development and transfer can
ensure participation, transparency, capacity building and learning among different players (high confidence). {2.5.1, 2.5.2,

International cooperation is a critical enabler for developing countries and vulnerable regions to strengthen their action for
the implementation of 1.5°C-consistent climate responses, including through enhancing access to finance and technology
and enhancing domestic capacities, taking into account national and local circumstances and needs (high confidence).

Collective efforts at all levels, in ways that reflect different circumstances and capabilities, in the pursuit of limiting global

warming over land than over the ocean (high confidence). Most
land regions are experiencing greater warming than the global average,
while most ocean regions are warming at a slower rate. Depending
on the temperature dataset considered, 20-40% of the global human
population live in regions that, by the decade 2006-2015, had already

magnitude of the overshoot, which may have implications for
impacts. All 1.5°C pathways involve limiting cumulative emissions
of long-lived greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and nitrous
oxide, and substantial reductions in other climate forcers (high
confidence). Limiting cumulative emissions requires either reducing
net global emissions of long-lived greenhouse gases to zero before
the cumulative limit is reached, or net negative global emissions
(anthropogenic removals) after the limit is exceeded. {1.2.3, 1.2.4,

"Past emissions alone are unlikely to raise global-mean
temperature to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels (medium

such as further sea level rise (high confidence). If all
anthropogenic emissions (including aerosol-related) were reduced
to zero immediately, any further warming beyond the 1°C already
experienced would /ikely be less than 0.5°C over the next two to
three decades (high confidence), and likely less than 0.5°C on a
century time scale (medium confidence), due to the opposing effects
of different climate processes and drivers. A warming greater than
1.5°C is therefore not geophysically unavoidable: whether it will
occur depends on future rates of emission reductions. {1.2.3, 1.2.4}

"This report assesses projected impacts at a global average
warming of 1.5°C and higher levels of warming. Global warming
of 1.5°C is associated with global average surface temperatures
fluctuating naturally on either side of 1.5°C, together with warming
substantially greater than 1.5°C in many regions and seasons (high
confidence), all of which must be considered in the assessment of
impacts. Impacts at 1.5°C of warming also depend on the emission
pathway to 1.5°C. Very different impacts result from pathways
that remain below 1.5°C versus pathways that return to 1.5°C
after a substantial overshoot, and when temperatures stabilize at
1.5°C versus a transient warming past 1.5°C (medium confidence).

"Climate adaptation refers to the actions taken to manage
impacts of climate change by reducing vulnerability and
exposure to its harmful effects and exploiting any potential
benefits. Adaptation takes place at international, national and
local levels. Subnational jurisdictions and entities, including urban
and rural municipalities, are key to developing and reinforcing
measures for reducing weather- and climate-related risks. Adaptation
implementation faces several barriers including lack of up-to-date and
locally relevant information, lack of finance and technology, social
values and attitudes, and institutional constraints (high confidence).
Adaptation is more likely to contribute to sustainable development
when policies align with mitigation and poverty eradication goals

"Ethical considerations, and the principle of equity in particular,
are central to this report, recognizing that many of the impacts
of warming up to and beyond 1.5°C, and some potential
impacts of mitigation actions required to limit warming to
1.5°C, fall disproportionately on the poor and vulnerable (high
confidence). Equity has procedural and distributive dimensions and
requires fairness in burden sharing both between generations and
between and within nations. In framing the objective of holding the
increase in the global average temperature rise to well below 2°C
above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit warming to
1.5°C, the Paris Agreement associates the principle of equity with the
broader goals of poverty eradication and sustainable development,
recognising that effective responses to climate change require a
global collective effort that may be guided by the 2015 United
Nations Sustainable Development Goals. {1.1.1}

"Human-induced warming reached approximately 1°C (likely)
between 0.8°C and 1.2°C) above pre-industrial levels in 2017,
increasing at 0.2°C (likely between 0.1°C and 0.3°C) per
decade (high confidence). Global warming is defined in this report
as an increase in combined surface air and sea surface temperatures
averaged over the globe and over a 30-year period. Unless otherwise
specified, warming is expressed relative to the period 1850-1900,
used as an approximation of pre-industrial temperatures in ARS.
For periods shorter than 30 years, warming refers to the estimated
average temperature over the 30 years centred on that shorter
period, accounting for the impact of any temperature fluctuations
or trend within those 30 years. Accordingly, warming from pre-
industrial levels to the decade 2006-2015 is assessed to be 0.87°C
(likely between 0.75°C and 0.99°C). Since 2000, the estimated level
of human-induced warming has been equal to the level of observed
warming with a likely range of +20% accounting for uncertainty due
to contributions from solar and volcanic activity over the historical

However, lack of global cooperation, lack of governance of the required

"Under emissions in line with current pledges under the Paris
Agreement (known as Nationally Determined Contributions,

pre-industrial levels, even if these pledges are supplemented
with very challenging increases in the scale and ambition of
mitigation after 2030 (high confidence). This increased action
would need to achieve net zero CO, emissions in less than 15 years.
Even if this is achieved, temperatures would only be expected to remain
below the 1.5°C threshold if the actual geophysical response ends up
being towards the low end of the currently estimated uncertainty range.
Transition challenges as well as identified trade-offs can be reduced if

"There is no single answer to the question of whether it
is feasible to limit warming to 1.5°C and adapt to the
consequences. Feasibility is considered in this report as the
capacity of a system as a whole to achieve a specific outcome. The
global transformation that would be needed to limit warming to
1.5°C requires enabling conditions that reflect the links, synergies
and trade-offs between mitigation, adaptation and sustainable
development. These enabling conditions are assessed across many
dimensions of feasibility — geophysical, environmental-ecological,
technological, economic, socio-cultural and institutional — that
may be considered through the unifying lens of the Anthropocene,
acknowledging profound, differential but increasingly geologically
significant human influences on the Earth system as a whole. This

suggests a remaining budget of about 420 GtCO, for a two-
thirds chance of limiting warming to 1.5°C, and of about 580

Remaining budgets applicable to 2100 would be approximately
100 GtCO, lower than this to account for permafrost thawing and
potential methane release from wetlands in the future, and more
thereafter. These estimates come with an additional geophysical
uncertainty of at least +400 GtCO,, related to non-CO, response

requires fairness in burden sharing both between generations and
between and within nations. In framing the objective of holding the
increase in the global average temperature rise to well below 2°C
above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit warming to
1.5°C, the Paris Agreement associates the principle of equity with the
broader goals of poverty eradication and sustainable development,

decade (high confidence). Global warming is defined in this report
as an increase in combined surface air and sea surface temperatures
averaged over the globe and over a 30-year period. Unless otherwise
specified, warming is expressed relative to the period 1850-1900,

For periods shorter than 30 years, warming refers to the estimated
average temperature over the 30 years centred on that shorter

or trend within those 30 years. Accordingly, warming from pre-
industrial levels to the decade 2006-2015 is assessed to be 0.87°C

The process of formalising the Anthropocene is on-going (Zalasiewicz et al., 2017), but a strong majority of the Anthropocene Working
Group (AWG) established by the Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy of the International Commission on Stratigraphy have
agreed that: (i) the Anthropocene has a geological merit; (ii) it should follow the Holocene as a formal epoch in the Geological Time
Scale; and, (iii) its onset should be defined as the mid-20th century. Potential markers in the stratigraphic record include an array of
novel manufactured materials of human origin, and “these combined signals render the Anthropocene stratigraphically distinct from
the Holocene and earlier epochs” (Waters et al., 2016). The Holocene period, which itself was formally adopted in 1885 by geological
science community, began 11,700 years ago with a more stable warm climate providing for emergence of human civilisation and
growing human-nature interactions that have expanded to give rise to the Anthropocene (Waters et al., 2016).

The concept of the Anthropocene can be linked to the aspiration of the Paris Agreement. The abundant empirical evidence of the
unprecedented rate and global scale of impact of human influence on the Earth System (Steffen et al., 2016; Waters et al., 2016) has
led many scientists to call for an acknowledgement that the Earth has entered a new geological epoch: the Anthropocene (Crutzen
and Stoermer, 2000; Crutzen, 2002; Gradstein et al., 2012). Although rates of change in the Anthropocene are necessarily assessed
over much shorter periods than those used to calculate long-term baseline rates of change, and therefore present challenges for direct
comparison, they are nevertheless striking. The rise in global CO, concentration since 2000 is about 20 ppm per decade, which is up to
10 times faster than any sustained rise in CO, during the past 800,000 years (Liithi et al, 2008; Bereiter et al., 2015). ARS found that
the last geological epoch with similar atmospheric CO, concentration was the Pliocene, 3.3 to 3.0 Ma (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2013).
Since 1970 the global average temperature has been rising at a rate of 1.7°C per century, compared to a long-term decline over the
past 7,000 years at a baseline rate of 0.01°C per century (NOAA, 2016; Marcott et al., 2013). These global-level rates of human-driven
change far exceed the rates of change driven by geophysical or biosphere forces that have altered the Earth System trajectory in the past
(e.g., Summerhayes, 2015; Foster et al., 2017); even abrupt geophysical events do not approach current rates of human-driven change.

The Anthropocene can be employed as a “boundary concept” (Brondizio et al., 2016) that frames critical insights into understanding the
drivers, dynamics and specific challenges in responding to the ambition of keeping global temperature well below 2°C while pursuing
efforts towards and adapting to a 1.5°C warmer world. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and
its Paris Agreement recognize the ability of humans to influence geophysical planetary processes (Chapter 2, Cross-Chapter Box 1 in this
chapter). The Anthropocene offers a structured understanding of the culmination of past and present human-environmental relations
and provides an opportunity to better visualize the future to minimize pitfalls (Pattberg and Zelli, 2016; Delanty and Mota, 2017), while
acknowledging the differentiated responsibility and opportunity to limit global warming and invest in prospects for climate-resilient
sustainable development (Harrington, 2016) (Chapter 5). The Anthropocene also provides an opportunity to raise questions regarding
the regional differences, social inequities, and uneven capacities and drivers of global social-environmental changes, which in turn
inform the search for solutions as explored in Chapter 4 of this report (Biermann et al., 2016). It links uneven influences of human
actions on planetary functions to an uneven distribution of impacts (assessed in Chapter 3) as well as the responsibility and response
capacity to, for example, limit global warming to no more than a 1.5°C rise above pre-industrial levels. Efforts to curtail greenhouse gas
emissions without incorporating the intrinsic interconnectivity and disparities associated with the Anthropocene world may themselves
negatively affect the development ambitions of some regions more than others and negate sustainable development efforts (see
Chapter 2 and Chapter 5).

"TheARS describes equity as having three dimensions: intergenerational
(fairness between generations), international (fairness between
states), and national (fairness between individuals) (Fleurbaey et al.,
2014). The principle is generally agreed to involve both procedural
justice (i.e., participation in decision making) and distributive justice
(ie., how the costs and benefits of climate actions are distributed)
(Kolstad et al., 2014; Savaresi, 2016; Reckien et al., 2017). Concerns
regarding equity have frequently been central to debates around
mitigation, adaptation and climate governance (Caney, 2005;
Schroeder et al., 2012; Ajibade, 2016; Reckien et al., 2017; Shue,

(e.g., needs, patterns of deprivation, or limited resources), as well
as to economic conditions (e.g., standard of living, inequality, or
economic position), and/or social relationships (e.g., social class,
dependency, lack of basic security, exclusion, or lack of entitlement;
Olsson et al., 2014). The UNDP now uses a Multidimensional Poverty
Index and estimates that about 1.5 billion people globally live in
multidimensional poverty, especially in rural areas of South Asia and
Sub-Saharan Africa, with an additional billion at risk of falling into
poverty (UNDP, 2016).

"Much of this literature is still new and evolving (Holz et al., 2017;
Dooley et al., 2018; Klinsky and Winkler, 2018), permitting the
present report to examine some broader equity concerns raised
both by possible failure to limit warming to 1.5°C and by the range
of ambitious mitigation efforts that may be undertaken to achieve
that limit. Any comparison between 1.5°C and higher levels of
warming implies risk assessments and value judgements and cannot
straightforwardly be reduced to a cost-benefit analysis (Kolstad et
al., 2014). However, different levels of warming can nevertheless be
understood in terms of their different implications for equity — that
is, in the comparative distribution of benefits and burdens for specific
states, persons, or generations, and in terms of their likely impacts
on sustainable development and poverty (see especially Sections

"A large and rapidly growing body of knowledge explores the
connections between climate change and poverty. Climatic
variability and climate change are widely recognized as factors that
may exacerbate poverty, particularly in countries and regions where
poverty levels are high (Leichenko and Silva, 2014). The AR5 noted
that climate change-driven impacts often act as a threat multiplier
in that the impacts of climate change compound other drivers of
poverty (Olsson et al., 2014). Many vulnerable and poor people are
dependent on activities such as agriculture that are highly susceptible
to temperature increases and variability in precipitation patterns
(Shiferaw et al., 2014; Miyan, 2015). Even modest changes in rainfall
and temperature patterns can push marginalized people into poverty
as they lack the means to recover from associated impacts. Extreme
events, such as floods, droughts, and heat waves, especially when
they occur in series, can significantly erode poor people's assets and
further undermine their livelihoods in terms of labour productivity,
housing, infrastructure and social networks (Olsson et al., 2014).

"A sizeable and growing literature exists on how best to
operationalize climate equity considerations, drawing on other
concepts mentioned in the Paris Agreement, notably its explicit
reference to human rights (OHCHR, 2009; Caney, 2010; Adger et
al., 2014; Fleurbaey et al., 2014; IBA, 2014; Knox, 2015; Duyck
et al., 2018; Robinson and Shine, 2018). Human rights comprise
internationally agreed norms that align with the Paris ambitions of
poverty eradication, sustainable development, and the reduction of
vulnerability (Caney, 2010; Fleurbaey et al., 2014; OHCHR, 2015).
In addition to defining substantive rights (such as to life, health,
and shelter) and procedural rights (such as to information and
participation), human rights instruments prioritise the rights of
marginalized groups, children, vulnerable and indigenous persons,
and those discriminated against on grounds such as gender, race,
age or disability (OHCHR, 2017). Several international human
rights obligations are relevant to the implementation of climate
actions and consonant with UNFCCC undertakings in the areas
of mitigation, adaptation, finance, and technology transfer (Knox,
2015; OHCHR, 2015; Humphreys, 2017).

"Four key framing asymmetries associated with the conditions of a
1.5°C warmer world have been noted (Okereke, 2010; Harlan et al.,
2015; Ajibade, 2016; Savaresi, 2016; Reckien et al., 2017) and are
reflected in the report's assessment. The first concerns differential
contributions to the problem: the observation that the benefits from
industrialization have been unevenly distributed and those who
benefited most historically also have contributed most to the current
climate problem and so bear greater responsibility (Shue, 2013;
McKinnon, 2015; Otto et al., 2017; Skeie et al., 2017). The second
asymmetry concerns differential impact: the worst impacts tend to
fall on those least responsible for the problem, within states, between
states, and between generations (Fleurbaey et al., 2014; Shue, 2014;
lonesco et al., 2016). The third is the asymmetry in capacity to shape
solutions and response strategies, such that the worst-affected states,
groups, and individuals are not always well represented (Robinson
and Shine, 2018). Fourth, there is an asymmetry in future response
capacity: some states, groups, and places are at risk of being left
behind as the world progresses to a low-carbon economy (Fleurbaey
et al., 2014; Shue, 2014; Humphreys, 2017).

"In summary, this report adopts a working definition of '1.5°C relative
to pre-industrial levels’ that corresponds to global average combined
land surface air and sea surface temperatures either 1.5°C warmer
than the average of the 51-year period 1850-1900, 0.87°C warmer
than the 20-year period 1986-2005, or 0.63°C warmer than the
decade 2006-2015. These offsets are based on all available published
global datasets, combined and updated, which show that 1986-
2005 was 0.63°C warmer than 1850-1900 (with a 5-95% range
of 0.57°C-0.69°C based on observational uncertainties alone), and
2006-2015 was 0.87°C warmer than 1850-1900 (with a likely range
of 0.75°C--0.99°C, also accounting for the possible impact of natural
fluctuations). Where possible, estimates of impacts and mitigation
pathways are evaluated relative to these more recent periods. Note
that the 5-95% intervals often quoted in square brackets in AR5
correspond to very likely ranges, while likely ranges correspond to
17-83%, or the central two-thirds, of the distribution of uncertainty.

"The feasibility of any global commitment to a 1.5°C pathway depends,
in part, on the cumulative influence of the nationally determined
contributions (NDCs), committing nation states to specific GHG
emission reductions. The current NDCs, extending only to 2030, do
not limit warming to 1.5°C. Depending on mitigation decisions after
2030, they cumulatively track toward a warming of 3°-4°C above
pre-industrial temperatures by 2100, with the potential for further
warming thereafter (Rogelj et al., 2016a; UNFCCC, 2016). The analysis
of pathways in this report reveals opportunities for greater decoupling
of economic growth from GHG emissions. Progress towards limiting
warming to 1.5°C requires a significant acceleration of this trend. AR5
concluded that climate change constrains possible development paths,
that synergies and trade-offs exist between climate responses and
socio-economic contexts, and that opportunities for effective climate
responses overlap with opportunities for sustainable development,
noting that many existing societal patterns of consumption are
intrinsically unsustainable (Fleurbaey et al., 2014).

global warming to 1.5°C would require substantial societal and
technological transformations, dependent in turn on global and
regional sustainable development pathways. A range of pathways,
both sustainable and not, are explored in this report, including
implementation strategies to understand the enabling conditions and
challenges required for such a transformation. These pathways and
connected strategies are framed within the context of sustainable
development, and in particular the United Nations 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development (UN, 2015b) and Cross-Chapter Box 4 on
SDGs (in this chapter). The feasibility of staying within 1.5°C depends
upon a range of enabling conditions with geophysical, environmental-
ecological, technological, economic, socio-cultural, and institutional
dimensions. Limiting warming to 1.5°C also involves identifying
technology and policy levers to accelerate the pace of transformation
(see Chapter 4). Some pathways are more consistent than others with
the requirements for sustainable development (see Chapter 5). Overall,
the three-pronged emphasis on sustainable development, resilience,
and transformation provides Chapter 5 an opportunity to assess
the conditions of simultaneously reducing societal vulnerabilities,
addressing entrenched inequalities, and breaking the circle of poverty.

"This report defines ‘warming’, unless otherwise qualified, as an
increase in multi-decade global mean surface temperature (GMST)
above pre-industrial levels. Specifically, warming at a given point
in time is defined as the global average of combined land surface
air and sea surface temperatures for a 30-year period centred on
that time, expressed relative to the reference period 1850-1900
(adopted for consistency with Box SPM.1 Figure 1 of IPCC (2014a))
‘as an approximation of pre-industrial levels’, excluding the impact of
natural climate fluctuations within that 30-year period and assuming
any secular trend continues throughout that period, extrapolating
into the future if necessary. There are multiple ways of accounting
for natural fluctuations and trends (e.g., Foster and Rahmstorf, 2011;
Haustein et al., 2017; Medhaug et al., 2017; Folland et al., 2018;
Visser et al., 2018), but all give similar results. A major volcanic
eruption might temporarily reduce observed global temperatures,
but would not reduce warming as defined here (Bethke et al., 2017).
Likewise, given that the level of warming is currently increasing at
0.3°C-0.7°C per 30 years (likely range quoted in Kirtman et al., 2013
and supported by Folland et al., 2018), the level of warming in 2017
was 0.15°C-0.35°C higher than average warming over the 30-year

1800 to 1850-1900 (Hawkins et al., 2017), but the anthropogenic
contribution to this warming is uncertain (Abram et al., 2016; Schurer

1986-2005 and 2006-2015. In the latter case, when using a single
decade to represent a 30-year average centred on that decade, it
is important to consider the potential impact of internal climate
variability. The years 2008-2013 were characterised by persistent
cool conditions in the Eastern Pacific (Kosaka and Xie, 2013; Medhaug

for short-term natural fluctuations, when warming is considered to be

a single month fluctuating over 1.5°C between now and 2020 (or, by
2030, for a longer period: Henley and King, 2017), but this would not
constitute temperatures ‘reaching 1.5°C’ on our working definition.

induced warming given to 0.1°C precision only).

"Warming is not observed or expected to be spatially or seasonally
uniform (Collins et al., 2013). A 1.5°C increase in GMST will be
associated with warming substantially greater than 1.5°C in many
land regions, and less than 1.5°C in most ocean regions. This is
illustrated by Figure 1.3, which shows an estimate of the observed
change in annual and seasonal average temperatures between
the 1850-1900 pre-industrial reference period and the decade
2006-2015 in the Cowtan-Way dataset. These regional changes are
associated with an observed GMST increase of 0.91°C in the dataset
shown here, or 0.87°C in the four-dataset average (Table 1.1). This
observed pattern reflects an on-going transient warming: features
such as enhanced warming over land may be less pronounced, but still
present, in equilibrium (Collins et al., 2013). This figure illustrates the
magnitude of spatial and seasonal differences, with many locations,
particularly in Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude winter (December-
February), already experiencing regional warming more than double
the global average. Individual seasons may be substantially warmer,
or cooler, than these expected changes in the long-term average.

"In the absence of strong natural forcing due to changes in solar or
volcanic activity, the difference between total and human-induced
warming is small: assessing empirical studies quantifying solar and
volcanic contributions to GMST from 1890 to 2010, ARS (Figure 10.6
of Bindoff et al., 2013) found their net impact on warming over the
full period to be less than plus or minus 0.1°C. Figure 1.2 shows that
the level of human-induced warming has been indistinguishable from
total observed warming since 2000, including over the decade 2006-
2015. Bindoff et al. (2013) assessed the magnitude of human-induced
warming over the period 1951-2010 to be 0.7°C (likely between
0.6°C and 0.8°C), which is slightly greater than the 0.65°C observed
warming over this period (Figures 10.4 and 10.5) with a likely range
of +14%. The key surface temperature attribution studies underlying
this finding (Gillett et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2013; Ribes and Terray,
2013) used temperatures since the 19th century to constrain human-
induced warming, and so their results are equally applicable to the
attribution of causes of warming over longer periods. Jones et al.
(2016) show (Figure 10) human-induced warming trends over the
period 1905-2005 to be indistinguishable from the corresponding
total observed warming trend accounting for natural variability using
spatio-temporal detection patterns from 12 out of 15 CMIP5 models
and from the multi-model average. Figures from Ribes and Terray
(2013), show the anthropogenic contribution to the observed linear
warming trend 1880-2012 in the HadCRUT4 dataset (0.83°C in Table
1.1) to be 0.86°C using a multi-model average global diagnostic, with
a 5-95% confidence interval of 0.72°C-1.00°C (see figure 1.SM.6).
In all cases, since 2000 the estimated combined contribution of solar
and volcanic activity to warming relative to 1850-1900 is found to be
less than +0.1°C (Gillett et al., 2013), while anthropogenic warming
is indistinguishable from, and if anything slightly greater than, the
total observed warming, with 5—95% confidence intervals typically
around +20%.

"Because of uncertainty in the climate response, a ‘prospective’
mitigation pathway (see Cross-Chapter Box 1 in this chapter), in which
emissions are prescribed, can only provide a level of probability of
warming remaining below a temperature threshold. This probability
cannot be quantified precisely since estimates depend on the method
used (Rogelj et al., 2016b; Millar et al, 2017b; Goodwin et al., 2018;
Tokarska and Gillett, 2018). This report defines a ‘1.5°C pathway’
as a pathway of emissions and associated possible temperature
responses in which the majority of approaches using presently
available information assign a probability of approximately one-in-
two to two-in-three to warming remaining below 1.5°C or, in the case
of an overshoot pathway, to warming returning to 1.5°C by around

modelling approach to avoid ambiguity, but probabilities of exceeding
1.5°C are checked against other approaches to verify that they lie
within this approximate range. All these absolute probabilities are
imprecise, depend on the information used to constrain them, and
hence are expected to evolve in the future. Imprecise probabilities
can nevertheless be useful for decision-making, provided the
imprecision is acknowledged (Hall et al., 2007; Kriegler et al., 2009;

much more consistently: approaches may differ on the absolute

which outcomes are more probable.

some (such as those associated with ocean acidification) scale with
the change in atmospheric CO, concentration, indicated by the

the proposed limit, pathways remaining below 1.5°C necessarily
involve much faster rates of net CO, emission reductions (Figure 1.4,

these pathways also reach 1.5°C earlier. Note that the emissions
associated with these schematic temperature pathways may not
correspond to feasible emission scenarios, but they do illustrate the
fact that the timing of net zero emissions does not in itself determine
peak warming: what matters is total cumulative emissions up to that

"Hence impacts that occur when GMST reaches 1.5°C could be very
different depending on the pathway to 1.5°C. CO, concentrations will
be higher as GMST rises past 1.5°C (transient warming) than when
GMST has stabilized at 1.5°C, while sea level and, potentially, global
mean precipitation (Pendergrass et al., 2015) would both be lower
(see Figure 1.4). These differences could lead to very different impacts
on agriculture, on some forms of extreme weather (e.g., Baker et al.,
2018), and on marine and terrestrial ecosystems (e.g., Mitchell et al.,
2017 and Boxes 3.1 and 3.2). Sea level would be higher still if GMST
returns to 1.5°C after an overshoot (Figure 1.4 d), with potentially
significantly different impacts in vulnerable regions. Temperature
overshoot could also cause irreversible impacts (see Chapter 3).

"In this category of 1.5°C pathways, human-induced warming either
rises monotonically to stabilise at 1.5°C (Figure 1.4, brown lines)
or peaks at or below 1.5°C and then declines (yellow lines). Figure
1.4b demonstrates that pathways remaining below 1.5°C require net
annual CO, emissions to peak and decline to near zero or below,
depending on the long-term adjustment of the carbon cycle and
non-CO, emissions (Bowerman et al., 2013; Wigley, 2018). Reducing
emissions to zero corresponds to stabilizing cumulative CO, emissions
(Figure 1.4c, solid lines) and falling concentrations of CO, in the
atmosphere (panel c dashed lines) (Matthews and Caldeira, 2008;
Solomon et al., 2009), which is required to stabilize GMST if non-CO,
climate forcings are constant and positive. Stabilizing atmospheric
greenhouse gas concentrations would result in continued warming
(see Section 1.2.4).
"	Text
"With the pathways in this category, also referred to as overshoot
pathways, GMST rises above 1.5°C relative to pre-industrial before
peaking and returning to 1.5°C around or before 2100 (Figure 1.4,
blue lines), subsequently either stabilising or continuing to fall. This
allows initially slower or delayed emission reductions, but lowering
GMST requires net negative global CO, emissions (net anthropogenic
removal of CO,; Figure 1.4b). Cooling, or reduced warming, through
sustained reductions of net non-CO, climate forcing (Cross-Chapter
Box 2 in this chapter) is also required, but their role is limited because
emissions of most non-CO, forcers cannot be reduced to below zero.
Hence the feasibility and availability of large-scale CO, removal
limits the possible rate and magnitude of temperature decline. In
this report, overshoot pathways are referred to as 1.5°C pathways,
but qualified by the amount of the temperature overshoot, which
can have a substantial impact on irreversible climate change impacts
(Mathesius et al., 2015; Tokarska and Zickfeld, 2015).

"Figure 1.4 illustrates categories of (a) 1.5°C pathways and associated
(b) annual and (c) cumulative emissions of CO,. It also shows (d)
an example of a ‘time-integrated impact’ that continues to increase
even after GMST has stabilised, such as sea level rise. This schematic
assumes for the purposes of illustration that the fractional contribution
of non-CO, climate forcers to total anthropogenic forcing (which is
currently increasing, Myhre et al., 2017) is approximately constant
from now on. Consequently, total human-induced warming is
proportional to cumulative CO, emissions (solid line in c), and GMST
stabilises when emissions reach zero. This is only the case in the most
ambitious scenarios for non-CO, mitigation (Leach et al., 2018). A
simple way of accounting for varying non-CO, forcing in Figure 1.4
would be to note that every 1 W m~ increase in non-CO, forcing
between now and the decade or two immediately prior to the time
of peak warming reduces cumulative CO, emissions consistent with
the same peak warming by approximately 1100 GtCO,, with a range
of 900-1500 GtCO, (using values from ARS: Myhre et al., 2013; Allen

"Climate change scenarios have been used in IPCC assessments since the First Assessment Report (Leggett et al, 1992). The SRES
scenarios (named after the IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios published in 2000; IPCC, 2000), consist of four scenarios that
do not take into account any future measures to limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Subsequently, many policy scenarios have been
developed based upon them (Morita et al. 2001). The SRES scenarios are superseded by a set of scenarios based on the Representative
Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs) (Riahi et al, 2017). The RCPs comprise a set of four GHG
concentration trajectories that jointly span a large range of plausible human-caused climate forcing ranging from 2.6 W m-? (RCP2.6)
to 8.5 W m? (RCP8.5) by the end of the 21st century (van Vuuren et al, 2011). They were used to develop climate projections in the
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5; Taylor et al., 2012) and were assessed in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report
(ARS). Based on the CMIP5 ensemble, RCP2.6, provides a better than two-in-three chance of staying below 2°C and a median warming
of 1.6°C relative to 1850-1900 in 2100 (Collins et al., 2013).

"scenarios and Fathways In this neport

This report focuses on pathways that could limit the increase of global mean surface temperature (GMST) to 1.5°C above pre-industrial
levels and pathways that align with the goals of sustainable development and poverty eradication. The pace and scale of mitigation
and adaptation are assessed in the context of historical evidence to determine where unprecedented change is required (see Chapter
4). Other scenarios are also assessed, primarily as benchmarks for comparison of mitigation, impacts, and/or adaptation requirements.
These include baseline scenarios that assume no climate policy; scenarios that assume some kind of continuation of current climate
policy trends and plans, many of which are used to assess the implications of the nationally determined contributions (NDCs); and
scenarios holding warming below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. This report assesses the spectrum from global mitigation scenarios
to local adaptation choices — complemented by a bottom-up assessment of individual mitigation and adaptation options, and their
implementation (policies, finance, institutions, and governance, see Chapter 4). Regional, national, and local scenarios, as well as
decision-making processes involving values and difficult trade-offs are important for understanding the challenges of limiting GMST
increase to 1.5°C and are thus indispensable when assessing implementation.

"In a ‘prospective’ mitigation pathway, emissions (or sometimes concentrations) are prescribed, giving a range of GMST outcomes
because of uncertainty in the climate response. Prospective pathways are considered '1.5°C pathways’ in this report if, based on current
knowledge, the majority of available approaches assign an approximate probability of one-in-two to two-in-three to temperatures
either remaining below 1.5°C or returning to 1.5°C either before or around 2100. Most pathways assessed in Chapter 2 are prospective
pathways, and therefore even '1.5°C pathways’ are also associated with risks of warming higher than 1.5°C, noting that many risks
increase non-linearly with increasing GMST. In contrast, the ‘risks of warming of 1.5°C’ assessed in Chapter 3 refer to risks in a
world in which GMST is either passing through (transient) or stabilized at 1.5°C, without considering probabilities of different GMST
levels (unless otherwise qualified). To stay below any desired temperature limit, mitigation measures and strategies would need to
be adjusted as knowledge of the climate response is updated (Millar et al., 2017b; Emori et al, 2018). Such pathways can be called
‘adaptive’ mitigation pathways. Given there is always a possibility of a greater-than-expected climate response (Xu and Ramanathan,
2017), adaptive mitigation pathways are important to minimise climate risks, but need also to consider the risks and feasibility (see
Cross-Chapter Box 3 in this chapter) of faster-than-expected emission reductions. Chapter 5 includes assessments of two related topics:
aligning mitigation and adaptation pathways with sustainable development pathways, and transformative visions for the future that
would support avoiding negative impacts on the poorest and most disadvantaged populations and vulnerable sectors.

"It is frequently asked whether limiting warming to 1.5°C is ‘feasible’
(Cross-Chapter Box 3 in this chapter). There are many dimensions to
this question, including the warming ‘commitment’ from past emissions
of greenhouse gases and aerosol precursors. Quantifying commitment
from past emissions is complicated by the very different behaviour of
different climate forcers affected by human activity: emissions of long-
lived greenhouse gases such as CO, and nitrous oxide (N,O) have a
very persistent impact on radiative forcing (Myhre et al., 2013), lasting
from over a century (in the case of N,O) to hundreds of thousands
of years (for CO,). The radiative forcing impact of short-lived climate
forcers (SLCFs) such as methane (CH,) and aerosols, in contrast,
persists for at most about a decade (in the case of methane) down to
only a few days. These different behaviours must be taken into account
in assessing the implications of any approach to calculating aggregate
emissions (Cross-Chapter Box 2 in this chapter).
"	Text
"The ZEC, although based on equally idealised assumptions, allows
for a clear separation of the response to past emissions from the
effects of future emissions. The magnitude and sign of the ZEC
depend on the mix of GHGs and aerosols considered. For CO,, which
takes hundreds of thousands of years to be fully removed from the
atmosphere by natural processes following its emission (Eby et al.,
2009; Ciais et al, 2013), the multi-century warming commitment
from emissions to date in addition to warming already observed
is estimated to range from slightly negative (ie, a slight cooling
relative to present-day) to slightly positive (Matthews and Caldeira,
2008; Lowe et al., 2009; Gillett et al, 2011; Collins et al., 2013).
Some studies estimate a larger ZEC from CO,, but for cumulative
emissions much higher than those up to present day (Frélicher et al.,
2014; Ehlert and Zickfeld, 2017). The ZEC from past CO, emissions
is small because the continued warming effect from ocean thermal
inertia is approximately balanced by declining radiative forcing due
to CO, uptake by the ocean (Solomon et al., 2009; Goodwin et al.,
2015; Williams et al., 2017). Thus, although present-day CO,-induced
warming is irreversible on millennial time scales (without human
intervention such as active carbon dioxide removal or solar radiation
modification; Section 1.4.1), past CO, emissions do not commit to
substantial further warming (Matthews and Solomon, 2013).
"	Text
"In other parts of the literature, ‘pathway’ implies a solution-oriented trajectory describing a pathway from today’s world to achieving a
set of future goals. Sustainable Development Pathways describe national and global pathways where climate policy becomes part of
a larger sustainability transformation (Shukla and Chaturvedi, 2013; Fleurbaey et al., 2014; van Vuuren et al., 2015). The ARS presented
climate-resilient pathways as sustainable development pathways that combine the goals of adaptation and mitigation (Denton et
al., 2014), more broadly defined as iterative processes for managing change within complex systems in order to reduce disruptions
and enhance opportunities associated with climate change (IPCC, 2014a). The ARS also introduced the notion of climate-resilient
development pathways, with a more explicit focus on dynamic livelihoods, multi-dimensional poverty, structural inequalities, and
equity among poor and non-poor people (Olsson et al., 2014). Adaptation pathways are understood as a series of adaptation choices
involving trade-offs between short-term and long-term goals and values (Reisinger et al, 2014). They are decision-making processes
sequenced over time with the purpose of deliberating and identifying socially salient solutions in specific places (Barnett et al., 2014;
Wise et al. 2014; Fazey et al., 2016). There is a range of possible pathways for transformational change, often negotiated through
iterative and inclusive processes (Harris et al., 2017; Fazey et al., 2018; Tabara et al., 2018).

If present-day emissions of all GHGs (short- and long-lived) and
aerosols (including sulphate, nitrate and carbonaceous aerosols) are
eliminated (Figure 1.5, yellow lines) GMST rises over the following
decade, driven by the removal of negative aerosol radiative forcing.
This initial warming is followed by a gradual cooling driven by the
decline in radiative forcing of short-lived greenhouse gases (Matthews
and Zickfeld, 2012; Collins et al., 2013). Peak warming following
elimination of all emissions was assessed at a few tenths of a degree in
AR5, and century-scale warming was assessed to change only slightly
relative to the time emissions are reduced to zero (Collins et al., 2013).
New evidence since AR5 suggests a larger methane forcing (Etminan
et al. 2016) but no revision in the range of aerosol forcing (although
this remains an active field of research, e.g., Myhre et al, 2017). This
revised methane forcing estimate results in a smaller peak warming
and a faster temperature decline than assessed in ARS (Figure 1.5,

"Climate forcers fall into two broad categories in terms of their impact on global temperature (Smith et al., 2012): long-lived GHGs, such
as CO, and nitrous oxide (N,O), whose warming impact depends primarily on the total cumulative amount emitted over the past century
or the entire industrial epoch; and short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs), such as methane and black carbon, whose warming impact
depends primarily on current and recent annual emission rates (Reisinger et al, 2012; Myhre et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2013; Strefler et
al., 2014). These different dependencies affect the emissions reductions required of individual forcers to limit warming to 1.5°C or any
other level.

"To date, reporting of GHG emissions under the UNFCCC has used Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) evaluated over a 100-year time
horizon (GWP,,,) to combine multiple climate forcers. IPCC Working Group 3 reports have also used GWP,,, to represent multi-gas
pathways (Clarke et al, 2014). For reasons of comparability and consistency with current practice, Chapter 2 in this Special Report
continues to use this aggregation method. Numerous other methods of combining different climate forcers have been proposed, such
as the Global Temperature-change Potential (GTP; Shine et al., 2005) and the Global Damage Potential (Tol et al, 2012; Deuber et al.,

"Emissions of many different climate forcers will affect the rate and magnitude of climate change over the next few decades (Myhre et al.,
2013). Since these decades will determine when 1.5°C is reached or whether a warming greater than 1.5°C is avoided, understanding
the aggregate impact of different forcing agents is particularly important in the context of 1.5°C pathways. Paragraph 17 of Decision 1
of the 21st Conference of the Parties on the adoption of the Paris Agreement specifically states that this report is to identify aggregate
greenhouse gas emission levels compatible with holding the increase in global average temperatures to 1.5°C above pre-industrial
levels (see Chapter 2). This request highlights the need to consider the implications of different methods of aggregating emissions of
different gases, both for future temperatures and for other aspects of the climate system (Levasseur et al., 2016; Ocko et al., 2017).

"Since most sources of emissions cannot, in reality, be brought to
Zero instantaneously due to techno-economic inertia, the current
rate of emissions also constitutes a conditional commitment to
future emissions and consequent warming depending on achievable
rates of emission reductions. The current level and rate of human-
induced warming determines both the time left before a temperature
threshold is exceeded if warming continues (dashed blue line
in Figure 1.5) and the time over which the warming rate must be
reduced to avoid exceeding that threshold (approximately indicated
by the dotted blue line in Figure 1.5). Leach et al. (2018) use a central
estimate of human-induced warming of 1.02°C in 2017, increasing
at 0.215°C per decade (Haustein et al., 2017), to argue that it will
take 13-32 years (one-standard-error range) to reach 1.5°C if the

to the multi-dataset average GMST used in this report gives an
assessed likely range for the date at which warming reaches 1.5°C

by multiple lines of evidence, including the AR5 assessment for the
likely range of warming (0.3°C-0.7°C) for the period 2016-2035
relative to 1986-2005. The upper bound, 2052, is supported by fewer

confidence interval given by the Leach et al. (2018) method applied to
the multi-dataset average GMST, expressed as the upper limit of the
likely range, to reflect the reliance on a single approach. Results are
sensitive both to the confidence level chosen and the number of years
used to estimate the current rate of anthropogenic warming (5 years
used here, to capture the recent acceleration due to rising non-CO,
forcing). Since the rate of human-induced warming is proportional
to the rate of CO, emissions (Matthews et al., 2009; Zickfeld et al.,
2009) plus a term approximately proportional to the rate of increase
in non-CO, radiative forcing (Gregory and Forster, 2008; Allen et al.,
2018; Cross-Chapter Box 2 in this chapter), these time scales also

"Emission reductions can interact with other dimensions of sustainable development (see Chapter 5). In particular, early action on
some SLCFs (including actions that may warm the climate, such as reducing sulphur dioxide emissions) may have considerable
societal co-benefits, such as reduced air pollution and improved public health with associated economic benefits (OECD, 2016;
Shindell et al., 2016). Valuation of broadly defined social costs attempts to account for many of these additional non-climate factors

"The comparison of the impacts of different climate forcers can also consider more than their effects on GMST (Johansson, 2012; Tol
et al., 2012; Deuber et al, 2013; Myhre et al., 2013; Cherubini and Tanaka, 2016). Climate impacts arise from both magnitude and
rate of climate change, and from other variables such as precipitation (Shine et al., 2015). Even if GMST is stabilised, sea level rise
and associated impacts will continue to increase (Sterner et al., 2014), while impacts that depend on CO, concentrations such as
ocean acidification may begin to reverse. From an economic perspective, comparison of different climate forcers ideally reflects the
ratio of marginal economic damages if used to determine the exchange ratio of different GHGs under multi-gas regulation (Tol et

"Whatever method is used to relate emissions of different greenhouse gases, scenarios achieving stable GMST well below 2°C
require both near-zero net emissions of long-lived greenhouse gases and deep reductions in warming SLCFs (Chapter 2), in part to
compensate for the reductions in cooling SLCFs that are expected to accompany reductions in CO, emissions (Rogelj et al., 2016b;
Hienola et al., 2018). Understanding the implications of different methods of combining emissions of different climate forcers is,
however, helpful in tracking progress towards temperature stabilisation and ‘balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources
and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases’ as stated in Article 4 of the Paris Agreement. Fuglestvedt et al. (2018) and Tanaka and
O'Neill (2018) show that when, and even whether, aggregate GHG emissions need to reach net zero before 2100 to limit warming
to 1.5°C depends on the scenario, aggregation method and mix of long-lived and short-lived climate forcers.

"When combined using GWP*, cumulative aggregate GHG emissions are closely proportional to total GHG-induced warming, while
the annual rate of GHG-induced warming is proportional to the annual rate of aggregate GHG emissions (see Cross-Chapter Box 2,
Figure 1). This is not the case when emissions are aggregated using GWP or GTP, with discrepancies particularly pronounced when
SLCF emissions are falling. Persistent net zero CO,-equivalent emissions containing a residual positive forcing contribution from
SLCFs and aggregated using GWP,,, or GTP would result in a steady decline of GMST. Net zero global emissions aggregated using
GWP* (which corresponds to zero net emissions of CO, and other long-lived GHGs like nitrous oxide, combined with near-constant
SLCF forcing — see Figure 1.5) results in approximately stable GMST (Allen et al., 2018; Fuglestvedt et al., 2018 and Cross-Chapter

"2009), meaning almost all remaining anthropogenic CO, emissions must be compensated for by an equal rate of anthropogenic carbon
dioxide removal (CDR). Cumulative CO, emissions are therefore an accurate indicator of CO,-induced warming, except in periods of
high negative CO2 emissions (Zickfeld et al., 2016), and potentially in century-long periods of near-stable temperatures (Bowerman et
al., 2011; Wigley, 2018). In contrast, sustained constant emissions of a SLCF such as methane, would (after a few decades) be consistent
with constant methane concentrations and hence very little additional methane-induced warming (Allen et al., 2018; Fuglestvedt et al.,
2018). Both GWP and GTP would equate sustained SLCF emissions with sustained constant CO, emissions, which would continue to
accumulate in the climate system, warming global temperatures indefinitely. Hence nominally ‘equivalent’ emissions of CO, and SLCFs,
if equated conventionally using GWP or GTP, have very different temperature impacts, and these differences are particularly evident
under ambitious mitigation characterizing 1.5°C pathways.

"Since the ARS, a revised usage of GWP has been proposed (Lauder et al., 2013; Allen et al., 2016), denoted GWP* (Allen et al.,
2018), that addresses this issue by equating a permanently sustained change in the emission rate of an SLCF or SLCF-precursor (in
tonnes-per-year), or other non-CO, forcing (in watts per square metre), with a one-off pulse emission (in tonnes) of a fixed amount
of CO,. Specifically, GWP* equates a 1 tonne-per-year increase in emission rate of an SLCF with a pulse emission of GWP,, x H tonnes
of CO,, where GWP, is the conventional GWP of that SLCF evaluated over time GWP,, for SLCFs decreases with increasing time H,
GWP.,, x H for SLCFs is less dependent on the choice of time horizon. Similarly, a permanent 1 W m’ increase in radiative forcing has
a similar temperature impact as the cumulative emission of H/AGWP,, tonnes of CO,, where AGWP, is the Absolute Global Warming
Potential of CO, (Shine et al., 2005; Myhre et al., 2013; Allen et al., 2018). This indicates approximately how future changes in non-
CO, radiative forcing affect cumulative CO, emissions consistent with any given level of peak warming.

"The impacts of 1.5°C global warming will vary in both space and

in the occurrence and/or intensity of some extreme events (Fischer
and Knutti, 2015; Karmalkar and Bradley, 2017; King et al., 2017;
Chevuturi et al., 2018), resulting in different impacts (see Chapter
3). By comparing impacts at 1.5°C versus those at 2°C, this report
discusses the ‘avoided impacts’ by maintaining global temperature
increase at or below 1.5°C as compared to 2°C, noting that these
also depend on the pathway taken to 1.5°C (see Section 1.2.3 and
Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3 on 1.5°C warmer worlds). Many
impacts take time to observe, and because of the warming trend,
impacts over the past 20 years were associated with a level of human-
induced warming that was, on average, 0.1°C-0.23°C colder than
its present level, based on the AR5 estimate of the warming trend
over this period (Section 1.2.1 and Kirtman et al. 2013). Attribution
studies (e.g., van Oldenborgh et al., 2017) can address this bias, but
informal estimates of ‘recent impact experience’ in a rapidly warming

increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels leading to changes in

importance to ambitious climate change mitigation pathways (Minx
et al., 2017). Although some CDR activities such as reforestation
and ecosystem restoration are well understood, the feasibility of
massive-scale deployment of many CDR technologies remains an
open question (IPCC, 2014b; Leung et al., 2014) (Chapters 2 and 4).
Technologies for the active removal of other greenhouse gases, such
as methane, are even less developed, and are briefly discussed in
Chapter 4.

"The connection between the enabling conditions for limiting global
warming to 1.5°C and the ambitions of the SDGs are complex across
scale and multi-faceted (Chapter 5). Climate mitigation—adaptation
linkages, including synergies and trade-offs, are important when
considering opportunities and threats for sustainable development.
The IPCC ARS acknowledged that ‘adaptation and mitigation
have the potential to both contribute to and impede sustainable
development, and sustainable development strategies and choices
have the potential to both contribute to and impede climate change
responses’ (Denton et al., 2014). Climate mitigation and adaptation
measures and actions can reflect and enforce specific patterns
of development and governance that differ amongst the world’s
regions (Gouldson et al., 2015; Termeer et al., 2017). The role of
limited adaptation and mitigation capacity, limits to adaptation and
mitigation, and conditions of mal-adaptation and mal-mitigation are
assessed in this report (Chapters 4 and 5).

"Climate change adaptation refers to the actions taken to manage
the impacts of climate change (IPCC, 2014a). The aim is to reduce
vulnerability and exposure to the harmful effects of climate change
(e.g., sea level rise, more intense extreme weather events or food
insecurity). It also includes exploring the potential beneficial
opportunities associated with climate change (for example, longer
growing seasons or increased yields in some regions). Different
adaptation pathways can be undertaken. Adaptation can be
incremental, or transformational, meaning fundamental attributes
of the system are changed (Chapter 3 and 4). There can be limits
to ecosystem-based adaptation or the ability of humans to adapt
(Chapter 4). If there is no possibility for adaptive actions that can
be applied to avoid an intolerable risk, these are referred to as
hard adaptation limits, while soft adaptation limits are identified
when there are currently no options to avoid intolerable risks, but
they are theoretically possible (Chapter 3 and 4). While climate
change is a global issue, impacts are experienced locally. Cities and
municipalities are at the frontline of adaptation (Rosenzweig et al.,
2018), focusing on reducing and managing disaster risks due to
extreme and slow-onset weather and climate events, installing flood
and drought early warning systems, and improving water storage
and use (Chapters 3 and 4 and Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5).
Agricultural and rural areas, including often highly vulnerable remote
and indigenous communities, also need to address climate-related
risks by strengthening and making more resilient agricultural and
other natural resource extraction systems.

all direct interventions on the planetary radiation budget. This report
does not use the term ‘geo-engineering’ because of inconsistencies

Large-scale SRM could potentially be used to supplement mitigation
in overshoot scenarios to keep the global mean temperature below
1.5°C and temporarily reduce the severity of near-term impacts (e.g.,
MacMartin et al., 2018). The impacts of SRM (both biophysical and

"This Cross-Chapter Box describes the concept of feasibility in relation to efforts to limit global warming to 1.5°C in the context of
sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty and draws from the understanding of feasibility emerging within the IPCC
(IPCC, 2017). Feasibility can be assessed in different ways, and no single answer exists as to the question of whether it is feasible to limit
warming to 1.5°C. This implies that an assessment of feasibility would go beyond a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’. Rather, feasibility provides a frame
to understand the different conditions and potential responses for implementing adaptation and mitigation pathways, and options
compatible with a 1.5°C warmer world. This report assesses the overall feasibility of limiting warming to 1.5°C, and the feasibility of
adaptation and mitigation options compatible with a 1.5°C warmer world, in six dimensions:

"Barriers for transitioning from climate change mitigation and
adaptation planning to practical policy implementation include
finance, information, technology, public attitudes, social values
and practices (Whitmarsh et al., 2011; Corner and Clarke, 2017),
and human resource constraints. Institutional capacity to deploy
available knowledge and resources is also needed (Mimura et al.,
2014). Incorporating strong linkages across sectors, devolution of
power and resources to sub-national and local governments with
the support of national government, and facilitating partnerships
among public, civic, private sectors and higher education institutions
(Leal Filho et al, 2018) can help in the implementation of identified
response options (Chapter 4). Implementation challenges of 1.5°C
pathways are larger than for those that are consistent with limiting
warming to well below 2°C, particularly concerning scale and speed
of the transition and the distributional impacts on ecosystems and
socio-economic actors. Uncertainties in climate change at different
scales and capacities to respond combined with the complexities of
coupled social and ecological systems point to a need for diverse and
adaptive implementation options within and among different regions
involving different actors. The large regional diversity between highly
carbon-invested economies and emerging economies are important
considerations for sustainable development and equity in pursuing
efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C. Key sectors, including energy, food
systems, health, and water supply, also are critical to understanding
these connections.

"The connections between the feasibility dimensions can be specified across three types of effects (discussed below). Each of these
dimensions presents challenges and opportunities in realizing conditions consistent with a 1.5°C warmer world.
"	Text
"Sustainable development, eradicating poverty and reducing inequalities are not only preconditions for feasible transformations, but
the interplay between climate action (both mitigation and adaptation options) and the development patterns to which they apply may
actually enhance the feasibility of particular options (see Chapter 5).
"	Text
"With each effect, the interplay between different conditions influences the feasibility of both pathways (Chapter 2) and options (Chapter
4), which in turn affect the likelihood of limiting warming to 1.5°C. The complexity of these interplays triggers unavoidable uncertainties,
requiring transformations that remain robust under a range of possible futures that limit warming to 1.5°C.
"	Text
"The six feasibility dimensions interact in complex and place-specific ways. Synergies and trade-offs may occur between the feasibility
dimensions, and between specific mitigation and adaptation options (Section 4.5.4). The presence or absence of enabling conditions
would affect the options that comprise feasibility pathways (Section 4.4), and can reduce trade-offs and amplify synergies between
options.

Socio-cultural: What conditions could support transformations in behaviour and lifestyles? To what extent are the transformations
socially acceptable and consistent with equity?

Institutional: What institutional conditions are in place to support transformations, including multi-level governance, institutional
capacity, and political support?

"Spatial effects: Conditions that are spatially variable and scale dependent, according to context-specific factors such as regional-
scale environmental resource limits and endowment; economic wealth of local populations; social organisation, cultural beliefs, values
and worldviews; spatial organisation, including conditions of urbanisation; and financial and institutional and governance capacity.
This means that the conditions for achieving the global transformation required for a 1.5°C world will be heterogeneous and vary
according to the specific context. On the other hand, the satisfaction of these conditions may depend upon global-scale drivers, such as
international flows of finance, technologies or capacities. This points to the need for understanding feasibility to capture the interplay
between the conditions at different scales.
"	Text
"Dynamic effects: Conditions that are highly dynamic and vary over time, especially under potential conditions of overshoot or no
overshoot. Some dimensions might be more time sensitive or sequential than others (i.e., if conditions are such that it is no longer
geophysically feasible to avoid overshooting 1.5°C, the social and institutional feasibility of avoiding overshoot will be no longer
relevant). Path dependencies, risks of legacy lock-ins related to existing infrastructures, and possibilities of acceleration permitted by
cumulative effects (e.g., dramatic cost decreases driven by learning-by-doing) are all key features to be captured. The effects can play
out over various time scales and thus require understanding the connections between near-term (meaning within the next several years
to two decades) and long-term implications (meaning over the next several decades) when assessing feasibility conditions.
"	Text
"Systemic effects: Conditions that have embedded within them system-level functions that could include linear and non-linear
connections and feedbacks. For example, the deployment of technology and large installations (e.g., renewable or low carbon energy
mega-projects) depends upon economic conditions (costs, capacity to mobilize investments for R&D), social or cultural conditions
(acceptability), and institutional conditions (political support; e.g., Sovacool et al., 2015). Case studies can demonstrate system-level
interactions and positive or negative feedback effects between the different conditions (Jacobson et al., 2015; Loftus et al., 2015). This
suggests that each set of conditions and their interactions need to be considered to understand synergies, inequities and unintended
consequences.
"	Text
"Assessment of feasibility in this report starts by evaluating the unavoidable warming from past emissions (Section 1.2.4) and identifying
mitigation pathways that would lead to a 1.5°C world, which indicates that rapid and deep deviations from current emission pathways
are necessary (Chapter 2). In the case of adaptation, an assessment of feasibility starts from an evaluation of the risks and impacts of
climate change (Chapter 3). To mitigate and adapt to climate risks, system-wide technical, institutional and socio-economic transitions
would be required, as well as the implementation of a range of specific mitigation and adaptation options. Chapter 4 applies various
indicators categorised in these six dimensions to assess the feasibility of illustrative examples of relevant mitigation and adaptation
options (Section 4.5.1). Such options and pathways have different effects on sustainable development, poverty eradication and
adaptation capacity (Chapter 5).

"In September 2015, the UN endorsed a universal agenda — ‘Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’
— which aims ‘to take the bold and transformative steps which are urgently needed to shift the world onto a sustainable and resilient

Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets to support people, prosperity, peace, partnerships and the planet (Kanie and Biermann,

"Sustainable development is most often defined as ‘development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability
of future generations to meet their own needs’ (WCED, 1987) and includes balancing social well-being, economic prosperity and
environmental protection. The AR5 used this definition and linked it to climate change (Denton et al., 2014). The most significant step
since ARS is the adoption of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and the emergence of literature that links them to climate (von
Stechow et al., 2015; Wright et al, 2015; Epstein and Theuer, 2017; Hammill and Price-Kelly, 2017; Kelman, 2017; Lofts et al., 2017;

"The report is framed to address these multiple goals simultaneously
and assesses the conditions to achieve a cost-effective and socially
acceptable solution, rather than addressing these goals piecemeal
(von Stechow et al., 2016) (Section 4.5.4 and Chapter 5), although
there may be different synergies and trade-offs between a 2°C (von
Stechow et al., 2016) and 1.5°C warmer world (Kainuma et al.,
2017). Climate-resilient development pathways (see Cross-Chapter
Box 12 in Chapter 5 and Glossary) are trajectories that strengthen
sustainable development, including mitigating and adapting to
climate change and efforts to eradicate poverty while promoting
fair and cross-scalar resilience in a changing climate. They take into
account dynamic livelihoods; the multiple dimensions of poverty,
structural inequalities; and equity between and among poor and
non-poor people (Olsson et al., 2014). Climate-resilient development
pathways can be considered at different scales, including cities, rural
areas, regions or at global level (Denton et al., 2014; Chapter 5).

"Embedded in the goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C is the
opportunity for intentional societal transformation (see Box 1.1
on the Anthropocene). The form and process of transformation are
varied and multifaceted (Pelling, 2011; O'Brien et al., 2012; O’Brien
and Selboe, 2015; Pelling et al, 2015). Fundamental elements of
1.5°C-related transformation include a decoupling of economic
growth from energy demand and CO, emissions; leap-frogging
development to new and emerging low-carbon, zero-carbon and
carbon-negative technologies; and synergistically linking climate
mitigation and adaptation to global scale trends (e.g., global trade
and urbanization) that will enhance the prospects for effective
climate action, as well as enhanced poverty reduction and greater
equity (Tschakert et al, 2013; Rogelj et al., 2015; Patterson et al.,
2017) (Chapters 4 and 5). The connection between transformative
climate action and sustainable development illustrates a complex
coupling of systems that have important spatial and time scale lag
effects and implications for process and procedural equity, including
intergenerational equity and for non-human species (Cross-Chapter
Box 4 in this chapter, Chapter 5). Adaptation and mitigation transition
pathways highlight the importance of cultural norms and values,
sector-specific context, and proximate (i.e., occurrence of an extreme
event) drivers that when acting together enhance the conditions for
societal transformation (Solecki et al., 2017; Rosenzweig et al., 2018)

improvements under the MDGs between 1990 and 2015, including reducing overall poverty and hunger, reducing infant mortality, and
improving access to drinking water (UN, 2015a). However, greenhouse gas emissions increased by more than 50% from 1990 to 2015,

"Climate change is also mentioned in SDGs beyond SDG13, for example in goal targets 1.5, 2.4, 11.B, 12.8.1 related to poverty, hunger,
cities and education respectively. The UNFCCC addresses other SDGs in commitments to ‘control, reduce or prevent anthropogenic
emissions of greenhouse gases [...] in all relevant sectors, including the energy, transport, industry, agriculture, forestry and waste
management sectors’ (Art4, 1(c)) and to work towards ‘the conservation and enhancement, as appropriate, of [...] biomass, forests and
oceans as well as other terrestrial, coastal and marine ecosystems’ (Art4, 1(d)). This corresponds to SDGs that seek clean energy for all

"Climate change is an integral influence on sustainable development, closely related to the economic, social and environmental
dimensions of the SDGs. The IPCC has woven the concept of sustainable development into recent assessments, showing how climate
change might undermine sustainable development, and the synergies between sustainable development and responses to climate
change (Denton et al., 2014). Climate change is also explicit in the SDGs. SDG13 specifically requires ‘urgent action to address climate
change and its impacts’. The targets include strengthening resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural
disasters; integrating climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning; and improving education, awareness-
raising and human and institutional capacity.

"The IPCC decision to prepare this report on the impacts of 1.5°C and associated emission pathways explicitly asked for the assessment
to be in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty. Chapter 1 frames the interaction between sustainable
development, poverty eradication and ethics and equity. Chapter 2 assesses how risks and synergies of individual mitigation measures
interact with 1.5°C pathways within the context of the SDGs and how these vary according to the mix of measures in alternative
mitigation portfolios (Section 2.5). Chapter 3 examines the impacts of 1.5°C global warming on natural and human systems with
comparison to 2°C and provides the basis for considering the interactions of climate change with sustainable development in Chapter 5.
Chapter 4 analyses strategies for strengthening the response to climate change, many of which interact with sustainable development.
Chapter 5 takes sustainable development, eradicating poverty and reducing inequalities as its focal point for the analysis of pathways
to 1.5°C and discusses explicitly the linkages between achieving SDGs while eradicating poverty and reducing inequality.

and impacts of climate change on natural and human systems (e.g.,

"Besides quantitative detection and attribution methods, assessments
can also be based on indigenous and local knowledge (see Chapter 4,
Box 4.3). While climate observations may not be available to assess
impacts from a scientific perspective, local community knowledge
can also indicate actual impacts (Brinkman et al., 2016; Kabir et al.,
2016). The challenge is that a community's perception of loss due
to the impacts of climate change is an area that requires further

"Global climate warming has already reached approximately 1°C
(see Section 1.2.1) relative to pre-industrial conditions, and thus
‘climate at 1.5°C global warming’ corresponds to approximately
the addition of only half a degree of warming compared to the
present day, comparable to the warming that has occurred since
the 1970s (Bindoff et al., 2013). Methods used in the attribution of
observed changes associate with this recent warming are therefore
also applicable to assessments of future changes in climate at 1.5°C
warming, especially in cases where no climate model simulations or
analyses are available.

"The grey literature category extends to empirical observations,
interviews, and reports from government, industry, research institutes,
conference proceedings and international or other organisations.
Incorporating knowledge from different sources, settings and
information channels while building awareness at various levels will
advance decision-making and motivate implementation of context-
specific responses to 1.5°C warming (Somanathan et al., 2014).
The assessment does not assess non-written evidence and does not
use oral evidence, media reports or newspaper publications. With
important exceptions, such as China, published knowledge from
the most vulnerable parts of the world to climate change is limited
(Czerniewicz et al., 2017).

"Impacts of 1.5°C global warming can be assessed in part from
regional and global climate changes that have already been detected
and attributed to human influence (e.g., Schleussner et al., 2017) and
are components of the climate system that are most responsive to
current and projected future forcing. For this reason, when specific
projections are missing for 1.5°C global warming, some of the
assessments of climate change provided in Chapter 3 (Section 3.3)
build upon joint assessments of (i) changes that were observed and
attributed to human influence up to the present, that is, for 1°C
global warming and (ii) projections for higher levels of warming (e.g.,
2°C, 3°C or 4°C) to assess the changes at 1.5°C. Such assessments
are for transient changes only (see Chapter 3, Section 3.3).

"Cost—benefit analyses are common tools used for decision-making,
whereby the costs of impacts are compared to the benefits from
different response actions (IPCC, 2014, b). However, for the
case of climate change, recognising the complex inter-linkages
of the Anthropocene, cost-benefit analysis tools can be difficult
to use because of disparate impacts versus costs and complex
interconnectivity within the global social-ecological system (see
Box 1.1 and Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 2). Some costs are
relatively easily quantifiable in monetary terms but not all. Climate
change impacts human lives and livelihoods, culture and values, and
whole ecosystems. It has unpredictable feedback loops and impacts
on other regions (IPCC, 2014a), giving rise to indirect, secondary,
tertiary and opportunity costs that are typically extremely difficult to
quantify. Monetary quantification is further complicated by the fact
that costs and benefits can occur in different regions at very different
times, possibly spanning centuries, while it is extremely difficult if not
impossible to meaningfully estimate discount rates for future costs
and benefits. Thus standard cost-benefit analyses become difficult
to justify (IPCC, 2014a; Dietz et al., 2016) and are not used as an
assessment tool in this report.

Models Intercomparison Project (CMIP) are used. The IPCC AR4 and
Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance
Climate Change Adaptation (SREX) reports were mostly based on
simulations from the CMIP3 experiment, while the AR5 was mostly
based on simulations from the CMIP5 experiment. The simulations
of the CMIP3 and CMIP5 experiments were found to be very
similar (e.g., Knutti and Sedlacek, 2012; Mueller and Seneviratne,
2014). In addition to the CMIP3 and CMIP5 experiments, results
from coordinated regional climate model experiments (e.g., the
Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment, CORDEX)
have been assessed and are available for different regions (Giorgi and
Gutowski, 2015). For instance, assessments based on publications
from an extension of the IMPACT2C project (Vautard et al., 2014;
Jacob and Solman, 2017) are newly available for 1.5°C projections.
Recently, simulations from the ‘Half a degree Additional warming,
Prognosis and Projected Impacts’ (HAPPI) multimode! experiment
have been performed to specifically assess climate changes at 1.5°C
vs 2°C global warming (Mitchell et al., 2016). The HAPPI protocol
consists of coupled land-atmosphere initial condition ensemble
simulations with prescribed sea surface temperatures (SSTs); sea ice,
GHG and aerosol concentrations; and solar and volcanic activity that
coincide with three forced climate states: present-day (2006-2015)
(see Section 1.2.1) and future (2091-2100) either with 1.5°C or 2°C
global warming (prescribed by modified SSTs).

"This report relies on the IPCC’s uncertainty guidance provided in
Mastrandrea et al. (2011) and sources given therein. Two metrics for
qualifying key findings are used:

"always problematic, but in the context of robust decision-making,
many near-term policies that are needed to keep open the option of
limiting warming to 1.5°C may be the same, regardless of the actual
probability that the goal will be met (Knutti et al., 2015).
"	Text
"Third, achieving ambitious mitigation goals will require active,
goal-directed efforts aiming explicitly for specific outcomes and
incorporating new information as it becomes available (Otto et
al, 2015). This shifts the focus of uncertainty from the climate
outcome itself to the level of mitigation effort that may be required
to achieve it. Probabilistic statements about human decisions are

"The storyline of this report (Figure 1.6) includes a set of interconnected
components. The report consists of five chapters (plus Supplementary
Material for Chapters 1 through 4), a Technical Summary and a
Summary for Policymakers. It also includes a set of boxes to elucidate
specific or cross-cutting themes, as well as Frequently Asked
Questions for each chapter, a Glossary, and several other Annexes.
"	Text
"Three specific challenges arise in the treatment of uncertainty and
risk in this report. First, the current state of the scientific literature on
1.5°C means that findings based on multiple lines of robust evidence
for which quantitative probabilistic results can be expressed may be
few in number, and those that do exist may not be the most policy-
relevant. Hence many key findings are expressed using confidence
qualifiers alone.
"	Text
"Response options and associated enabling conditions emerge next, in
Chapter 4. Attention is directed to exploring questions of adaptation
and mitigation implementation, integration, and transformation in
a highly interdependent world, with consideration of synergies and
trade-offs. Emission pathways, in particular, are broken down into
policy options and instruments. The role of technological choices,
institutional capacity and global-scale trends like urbanization and
changes in ecosystems are assessed.
"	Text
"Projected impacts that emerge in a 1.5°C warmer world and beyond
are dominant narrative threads of the report and are assessed in
Chapter 3. The chapter focuses on observed and attributable global
and regional climate changes and impacts and vulnerabilities. The
projected impacts have diverse and uneven spatial, temporal, human,
economic, and ecological system-level manifestations. Central to the
assessment is the reporting of impacts at 1.5°C and 2°C, potential
impacts avoided through limiting warming to 1.5°C, and, where
possible, adaptation potential and limits to adaptive capacity.
"	Text
"In Chapter 2, scenarios of a 1.5°C warmer world and the associated
pathways are assessed. The pathways assessment builds upon
the ARS with a greater emphasis on sustainable development in
mitigation pathways. All pathways begin now and involve rapid
and unprecedented societal transformation. An important framing
device for this report is the recognition that choices that determine
emissions pathways, whether ambitious mitigation or ‘no policy’
scenarios, do not occur independently of these other changes and
are, in fact, highly interdependent.
"	Text
"Likelihood: A calibrated language scale is used to communicate
assessed probabilities of outcomes, ranging from exceptionally
unlikely (<1%), extremely unlikely (<5%), very unlikely (<10%),
unlikely (<33%), about as likely as not (33-66%), likely (>66%), very
likely (>90%), extremely likely (>95%) to virtually certain (>99%).
These terms are normally only applied to findings associated with
high or very high confidence. Frequency of occurrence within a model
ensemble does not correspond to actual assessed probability of
outcome unless the ensemble is judged to capture and represent the
full range of relevant uncertainties.
"	Text
"Second, many of the most important findings of this report are
conditional because they refer to ambitious mitigation scenarios,
potentially involving large-scale technological or societal
transformation. Conditional probabilities often depend strongly on
how conditions are specified, such as whether temperature goals
are met through early emission reductions, reliance on negative
emissions, or through a low climate response. Whether a certain
risk is considered high at 1.5°C may therefore depend strongly on
how 1.5°C is specified, whereas a statement that a certain risk may
be substantially higher at 2°C relative to 1.5°C may be much more
robust.
"	Text
"At a time of unequivocal and rapid global warming, this report
emerges from the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement
— strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change
by pursuing efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C through reducing
emissions to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by
sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases. The assessment
focuses first, in Chapter 1, on how 1.5°C is defined and understood,
what is the current level of warming to date, and the present
trajectory of change. The framing presented in Chapter 1 provides the
basis through which to understand the enabling conditions of a 1.5°C
warmer world and connections to the SDGs, poverty eradication, and
equity and ethics.
"	Text
"Confidence: Five qualifiers are used to express levels of confidence
in key findings, ranging from very low, through /ow, medium,
high, to very high. The assessment of confidence involves at least
two dimensions, one being the type, quality, amount or internal
consistency of individual lines of evidence, and the second being
the level of agreement between different lines of evidence. Very
high confidence findings must either be supported by a high level
of agreement across multiple lines of mutually independent and
individually robust lines of evidence or, if only a single line of evidence
is available, by a very high level of understanding underlying that
evidence. Findings of low or very low confidence are presented only
if they address a topic of major concern.

"Chapter 5 covers linkages between achieving the SDGs and a 1.5°C
warmer world and turns toward identifying opportunities and
challenges of transformation. This is assessed within a transition to
climate-resilient development pathways and connection between the
evolution towards 1.5°C, associated impacts, and emission pathways.
Positive and negative effects of adaptation and mitigation response
measures and pathways for a 1.5°C warmer world are examined.
"	Text
"Progress along these pathways involves inclusive processes,
institutional integration, adequate finance and technology, and
attention to issues of power, values, and inequalities to maximize
the benefits of pursuing climate stabilisation at 1.5°C and the goals
of sustainable development at multiple scales of human and natural
systems from global, regional, national to local and community
levels.

"The combination of rising exposure to climate change and the fact that there is a limited capacity to adapt to its
impacts amplifies the risks posed by warming of 1.5°C and 2°C. This is particularly true for developing and island
countries in the tropics and other vulnerable countries and areas. The risks posed by global warming of 1.5°C are

"At the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) in December 2015, 195 nations adopted the Paris Agreement’. The
first instrument of its kind, the landmark agreement includes the aim to strengthen the global response to the
threat of climate change by ‘holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above
pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels’.
"	Text
"Summary: Climate change represents an urgent and potentially irreversible threat to human societies and the
planet. In recognition of this, the overwhelming majority of countries around the world adopted the Paris Agree-
ment in December 2015, the central aim of which includes pursuing efforts to limit global temperature rise
to 1.5°C. In doing so, these countries, through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC), also invited the IPCC to provide a Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-
industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emissions pathways.
"	Text
"With the adoption of the Paris Agreement, the UNFCCC invited the IPCC to provide a Special Report in 2018 on
‘the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emissions
pathways’. The request was that the report, known as SR1.5, should not only assess what a 1.5°C warmer world
would look like but also the different pathways by which global temperature rise could be limited to 1.5°C. In
2016, the IPCC accepted the invitation, adding that the Special Report would also look at these issues in the
context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development and
efforts to eradicate poverty.
"	Text
"The first UNFCCC document to mention a limit to global warming of 1.5°C was the Cancun Agreement, adopted
at the sixteenth COP (COP16) in 2010. The Cancun Agreement established a process to periodically review the
‘adequacy of the long-term global goal (LTGG) in the light of the ultimate objective of the Convention and the
overall progress made towards achieving the LTGG, including a consideration of the implementation of the
commitments under the Convention’. The definition of LTGG in the Cancun Agreement was ‘to hold the increase
in global average temperature below 2°C above pre-industrial levels’. The agreement also recognised the need
to consider ‘strengthening the long-term global goal on the basis of the best available scientific knowledge...to
a global average temperature rise of 1.5°C’.
"	Text
"Beginning in 2013 and ending at the COP21 in Paris in 2015, the first review period of the long-term global goal
largely consisted of the Structured Expert Dialogue (SED). This was a fact-finding, face-to-face exchange of views
between invited experts and UNFCCC delegates. The final report of the SED’ concluded that ‘in some regions and
vulnerable ecosystems, high risks are projected even for warming above 1.5°C’. The SED report also suggested
that Parties would profit from restating the temperature limit of the long-term global goal as a ‘defence line’
or ‘buffer zone’, instead of a ‘guardrail’ up to which all would be safe, adding that this new understanding
would ‘probably also favour emission pathways that will limit warming to a range of temperatures below 2°C’.
Specifically on strengthening the temperature limit of 2°C, the SED’s key message was: ‘While science on the
1.5°C warming limit is less robust, efforts should be made to push the defence line as low as possible’. The
findings of the SED, in turn, fed into the draft decision adopted at COP21.

"	Title
"In the decade 2006-2015, warming reached 0.87°C (+0.12°C) relative to 1850-1900, predominantly due to human
activity increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Given that global temperature is currently
rising by 0.2°C (+0.1°C) per decade, human-induced warming reached 1°C above pre-industrial levels around
2017 and, if this pace of warming continues, would reach 1.5°C around 2040.
"	Text
"Summary: Human-induced warming has already reached about 1°C above pre-industrial levels at the time of writ-
ing of this Special Report. By the decade 2006-2015, human activity had warmed the world by 0.87°C (+0.12°C)
compared to pre-industrial times (1850-1900). If the current warming rate continues, the world would reach
human-induced global warming of 1.5°C around 2040.
"	Text
"The choice of pre-industrial reference period, along with the method used to calculate global average
temperature, can alter scientists’ estimates of historical warming by a couple of tenths of a degree Celsius. Such
differences become important in the context of a global temperature limit just half a degree above where we are

now. But provided consistent definitions are used, they do not affect our understanding of how human activity
is influencing the climate.
"	Text
"Once scientists have defined ‘pre-industrial’, the next step is to calculate the amount of warming at any given
time relative to that reference period. In this report, warming is defined as the increase in the 30-year global
average of combined air temperature over land and water temperature at the ocean surface. The 30-year
timespan accounts for the effect of natural variability, which can cause global temperatures to fluctuate from
one year to the next. For example, 2015 and 2016 were both affected by a strong El Nifio event, which amplified
the underlying human-caused warming.
"	Text
"While the change in global average temperature tells researchers about how the planet as a whole is changing,
looking more closely at specific regions, countries and seasons reveals important details. Since the 1970s, most
land regions have been warming faster than the global average, for example. This means that warming in
many regions has already exceeded 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Over a fifth of the global population live

in regions that have already experienced warming in at least one season that is greater than 1.5°C above pre-
industrial levels.
"	Text
"Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, countries agreed to cut greenhouse gas emissions with a view to ‘holding the
increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to
limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels’. While the overall intention of strengthening
the global response to climate change is clear, the Paris Agreement does not specify precisely what is meant by
‘global average temperature’, or what period in history should be considered ‘pre-industrial’. To answer the
question of how close are we to 1.5°C of warming, we need to first be clear about how both terms are defined
in this Special Report.
"	Text
"In principle, ‘pre-industrial levels’ could refer to any period of time before the start of the industrial revolution.
But the number of direct temperature measurements decreases as we go back in time. Defining a ‘pre-industrial’
reference period is, therefore, a compromise between the reliability of the temperature information and how
representative it is of truly pre-industrial conditions. Some pre-industrial periods are cooler than others for
purely natural reasons. This could be because of spontaneous climate variability or the response of the climate
to natural perturbations, such as volcanic eruptions and variations in the sun’s activity. This IPCC Special Report
on Global Warming of 1.5°C uses the reference period 1850-1900 to represent pre-industrial temperature. This
is the earliest period with near-global observations and is the reference period used as an approximation of pre-
industrial temperatures in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report.

"Pathways consistent with 1.5°C of warming above pre-industrial
levels can be identified under a range of assumptions about
economic growth, technology developments and lifestyles.
However, lack of global cooperation, lack of governance of the required
energy and land transformation, and increases in resource-intensive
consumption are key impediments to achieving 1.5°C pathways.
Governance challenges have been related to scenarios with high
inequality and high population growth in the 1.5°C pathway literature.

the global average discounted marginal abatement costs for limiting

electrification of energy end use, deep reductions in agricultural

"Under emissions in line with current pledges under the Paris
Agreement (known as Nationally Determined Contributions,
or NDCs), global warming is expected to surpass 1.5°C above
pre-industrial levels, even if these pledges are supplemented
with very challenging increases in the scale and ambition of
mitigation after 2030 (high confidence). This increased action
would need to achieve net zero CO, emissions in less than 15 years.
Even if this is achieved, temperatures would only be expected to remain
below the 1.5°C threshold if the actual geophysical response ends up
being towards the low end of the currently estimated uncertainty range.
Transition challenges as well as identified trade-offs can be reduced if
global emissions peak before 2030 and marked emissions reductions
compared to today are already achieved by 2030. {2.2, 2.3.5, Cross-

"Limiting warming to 1.5°C depends on greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions over the next decades, where lower GHG emissions in
2030 lead to a higher chance of keeping peak warming to 1.5°C

than 0.1°C) overshoot of 1.5°C keep GHG emissions in 2030 to 25-30
GtCO2e yr"" in 2030 (interquartile range). This contrasts with median
estimates for current unconditional NDCs of 52-58 GtCO,e yr"" in
2030. Pathways that aim for limiting warming to 1.5°C by 2100 after
a temporary temperature overshoot rely on large-scale deployment
of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) measures, which are uncertain and
entail clear risks. In model pathways with no or limited overshoot of
1.5°C, global net anthropogenic CO, emissions decline by about 45%

Zero around 2050 (2045-2055 interquartile range). For limiting global
warming to below 2°C with at least 66% probability CO, emissions

others rely more on afforestation, which are the two CDR methods
most often included in integrated pathways. Trade-offs with other

"Cumulative CO, emissions are kept within a budget by reducing
global annual CO, emissions to net zero. This assessment
suggests a remaining budget of about 420 GtCO, for a two-
thirds chance of limiting warming to 1.5°C, and of about 580
GtCO, for an even chance (medium confidence). The remaining
carbon budget is defined here as cumulative CO, emissions from the
start of 2018 until the time of net zero global emissions for global
warming defined as a change in global near-surface air temperatures.
Remaining budgets applicable to 2100 would be approximately
100 GtCO, lower than this to account for permafrost thawing and
potential methane release from wetlands in the future, and more
thereafter. These estimates come with an additional geophysical
uncertainty of at least +400 GtCO,, related to non-CO, response
and TCRE distribution. Uncertainties in the level of historic warming
contribute +250 GtCO,. In addition, these estimates can vary by
+250 GtCO, depending on non-CO, mitigation strategies as found in

"All analysed pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C with no
or limited overshoot use CDR to some extent to neutralize
emissions from sources for which no mitigation measures
have been identified and, in most cases, also to achieve
net negative emissions to return global warming to 1.5°C
following a peak (high confidence). The longer the delay in
reducing CO, emissions towards zero, the larger the likelihood
of exceeding 1.5°C, and the heavier the implied reliance on
net negative emissions after mid-century to return warming to
1.5°C (high confidence). The faster reduction of net CO, emissions
in 1.5°C compared to 2°C pathways is predominantly achieved by
measures that result in less CO, being produced and emitted, and
only to a smaller degree through additional CDR. Limitations on
the speed, scale and societal acceptability of CDR deployment also
limit the conceivable extent of temperature overshoot. Limits to our
understanding of how the carbon cycle responds to net negative
emissions increase the uncertainty about the effectiveness of CDR to
decline temperatures after a peak. {2.2, 2.3, 2.6, 4.3.7}

return global mean warming to 1.5°C (relative to the pre-industrial
base period 1850-1900). Key questions addressed are: What types of
mitigation pathways have been developed that could be consistent
with 1.5°C? What changes in emissions, energy and land use do they
entail? What do they imply for climate policy and implementation, and
what impacts do they have on sustainable development? In terms of
feasibility (see Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1), this chapter focuses
on geophysical dimensions and technological and economic enabling
factors. Social and institutional dimensions as well as additional
aspects of technical feasibility are covered in Chapter 4.

degree which questions can be addressed with a specific scenario
set, for example, the exploration of implications of delayed climate
mitigation action. In this assessment, the following classes of 1.5°C-
and 2°C-consistent scenarios are of particular interest to the topics
addressed in this chapter: (i) scenarios with the same climate target
over the 21st century but varying socio-economic assumptions
(Sections 2.3 and 2.4), (ii) pairs of scenarios with similar socio-
economic assumptions but with forcing targets aimed at 1.5°C and 2°C

"Plausible developments need to be anticipated in many facets of the
key sectors of energy and land use. Within energy, these scenarios
consider energy resources like biofuels, energy supply and conversion
technologies, energy consumption, and supply and end-use efficiency.
Within land use, agricultural productivity, food demand, terrestrial
carbon management, and biofuel production are all considered.
Climate policies are also considered, including carbon pricing and
technology policies such as research and development funding and
subsidies. The scenarios incorporate regional differentiation in sectoral
and policy development. The climate changes resulting from such
scenarios are derived using models that typically incorporate physical
understanding of the carbon cycle and climate response derived from
complex geophysical models evaluated against observations (Sections
2.2 and 2.6).

"The temperature response to a given emission pathway (see glossary) is
uncertain and therefore quantified in terms of a probabilistic outcome.
Chapter 1 assesses the climate objectives of the Paris Agreement in
terms of human-induced warming, thus excluding potential impacts
of natural forcing such as volcanic eruptions or solar output changes
or unforced internal variability. Temperature responses in this chapter
are assessed using simple geophysically based models that evaluate
the anthropogenic component of future temperature change and do
not incorporate internal natural variations and are thus fit for purpose
in the context of this assessment (Section 2.2.1). Hence a scenario
that is consistent with 1.5°C may in fact lead to either a higher or
lower temperature change, but within quantified and generally well-
understood bounds (see also Chapter 1, Section 1.2.3). Consistency
with avoiding a human-induced temperature change limit must
therefore also be defined probabilistically, with likelihood values
selected based on risk-avoidance preferences. Responses beyond
global mean temperature are not typically evaluated in such models
and are assessed in Chapter 3.

"Mitigation pathways are typically designed to reach a predefined
climate target alone. Minimization of mitigation expenditures, but
not climate-related damages or sustainable development impacts,
is often the basis for these pathways to the desired climate target
(see Cross-Chapter Box 5 in this chapter for additional discussion).
However, there are interactions between mitigation and multiple other
sustainable development goals (see Sections 1.1 and 5.4) that provide
both challenges and opportunities for climate action. Hence there are
substantial efforts to evaluate the effects of the various mitigation
pathways on sustainable development, focusing in particular on
aspects for which integrated assessment models (IAMs) provide
relevant information (e.g., land-use changes and biodiversity, food
security, and air quality). More broadly, there are efforts to incorporate
climate change mitigation as one of multiple objectives that, in general,
reflect societal concerns more completely and could potentially provide
benefits at lower costs than simultaneous single-objective policies
(eg., Clarke et al., 2014). For example, with carefully selected policies,
universal energy access can be achieved while simultaneously reducing
air pollution and mitigating climate change (McCollum et al., 2011;
Riahi et al., 2012; IEA, 2017d). This chapter thus presents both the
pathways and an initial discussion of their context within sustainable
development objectives (Section 2.5), with the latter, along with equity
and ethical issues, discussed in more detail in Chapter 5.

"A large number of these scenarios were collected in a scenario database
established for the assessment of this Special Report (Supplementary
Material 2.$M.1.3). Mitigation pathways were classified by four
factors: consistency with a temperature increase limit (as defined by
Chapter 1), whether they temporarily overshoot that limit, the extent
of this potential overshoot, and the likelihood of falling within these
bounds.

"Specifically, they were put into classes that either kept surface
temperature increases below a given threshold throughout the 21st
century or returned to a value below 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels
at some point before 2100 after temporarily exceeding that level earlier
—referred to as an overshoot (0S). Both groups were further separated
based on the probability of being below the threshold and the degree
of overshoot, respectively (Table 2.1). Pathways are uniquely classified,
with 1.5°C-related classes given higher priority than 2°C classes in
cases where a pathway would be applicable to either class.

"Mitigation pathways developed with detailed process-based
integrated assessment models (IAMs) covering all sectors and regions
over the 21st century describe an internally consistent and calibrated
(to historical trends) way to get from current developments to
meeting long-term climate targets like 1.5°C (Clarke et al. 2014). The
overwhelming majority of available 1.5°C pathways were generated
by such IAMs, and these pathways can be directly linked to climate
outcomes and their consistency with the 1.5°C goal evaluated. The
AR5 similarly relied upon such studies, which were mainly discussed in
Chapter 6 of Working Group III (WGIll) (Clarke et al, 2014).

"Ultimately, society will adjust the choices it makes as new information
becomes available and technical learning progresses, and these
adjustments can be in either direction. Earlier scenario studies have
shown, however, that deeper emissions reductions in the near term
hedge against the uncertainty of both climate response and future
technology availability (Luderer et al., 2013; Rogelj et al. 2013b; Clarke
et al, 2014). Not knowing what adaptations might be put in place in
the future, and due to limited studies, this chapter examines prospective
rather than iteratively adaptive mitigation pathways (Cross-Chapter
Box 1 in Chapter 1). Societal choices illustrated by scenarios may also
influence what futures are envisioned as possible or desirable and
hence whether those come into being (Beck and Mahony, 2017).
"	Text
"Characteristics of these pathways, such as emissions reduction rates,
time of peaking, and low-carbon energy deployment rates, can be
assessed as being consistent with 1.5°C. However, they cannot be
assessed as ‘requirements’ for 1.5°C, unless a targeted analysis
is available that specifically asked whether there could be other
1.5°C-consistent pathways without the characteristics in question. ARS
already assessed such targeted analyses, for example, asking which
technologies are important in order to keep open the possibility of
limiting warming to 2°C (Clarke et al., 2014). By now, several such
targeted analyses are also available for questions related to 1.5°C
(Luderer et al., 2013; Rogelj et al, 2013b; Bauer et al, 2018; Strefler
et al., 2018b; van Vuuren et al., 2018). This assessment distinguishes
between ‘consistent’ and the much stronger concept of required
characteristics of 1.5°C pathways wherever possible.

"The probability assessment used in the scenario classification is based
on simulations using two reduced-complexity carbon cycle, atmospheric
composition, and climate models: the ‘Model for the Assessment of
Greenhouse Gas-Induced Climate Change’ (MAGICC) (Meinshausen
et al, 2011a), and the ‘Finite Amplitude Impulse Response’ (FAIRv1.3)
model (Smith et al, 2018). For the purpose of this report, and to facilitate
comparison with ARS, the range of the key carbon cycle and climate
parameters for MAGICC and its setup are identical to those used in
AR5 WGIll (Clarke et al, 2014). For each mitigation pathway, MAGICC
and FAIR simulations provide probabilistic estimates of atmospheric
concentrations, radiative forcing and global temperature outcomes until
2100. However, the classification uses MAGICC probabilities directly for
traceability with ARS and because this model is more established in the
literature. Nevertheless, the overall uncertainty assessment is based on
results from both models, which are considered in the context of the
latest radiative forcing estimates and observed temperatures (Etminan
et al, 2016; Smith et al, 2018) (Section 2.2 and Supplementary Material
2.SM.1.1). The comparison of these lines of evidence shows high
agreement in the relative temperature response of pathways, with
medium agreement on the precise absolute magnitude of warming,
introducing a level of imprecision in these attributes. Consideration of
the combined evidence here leads to medium confidence in the overall
geophysical characteristics of the pathways reported here.

with such models. IAMs combine insights from various disciplines in a
single framework, resulting in a dynamic description of the coupled
energy—economy-land-climate system that cover the largest sources
of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from different
sectors. Many of the IAMs that contributed mitigation scenarios to this
assessment include a process-based description of the land system in
addition to the energy system (e.g., Popp et al., 2017), and several have
been extended to cover air pollutants (Rao et al., 2017) and water use
(Hejazi et al. 2014; Fricko et al., 2016; Mouratiadou et al, 2016). Such
integrated pathways hence allow the exploration of the whole-system
transformation, as well as the interactions, synergies, and trade-

mitigation (von Stechow et al., 2015). The models do not, however, fully

consistent with sector-specific studies (Clarke et al, 2014). A growing
body of literature on 100%-renewable energy scenarios has emerged
(eg., see Creutzig et al, 2017; Jacobson et al., 2017), which goes
beyond the wide range of IAM projections of renewable energy shares
in 1.5°C and 2°C pathways. While the representation of renewable
energy resource potentials, technology costs and system integration in
IAMs has been updated since ARS, leading to higher renewable energy
deployments in many cases (Luderer et al., 2017; Pietzcker et al, 2017),
none of the IAM projections identify 100% renewable energy solutions
for the global energy system as part of cost-effective mitigation
pathways (Section 2.4.2). Bottom-up studies find higher mitigation
potentials in the industry, buildings, and transport sectors in 2030 than
realized in selected 2°C pathways from IAMs (UNEP 2017), indicating
the possibility to strengthen sectoral decarbonization strategies until
2030 beyond the integrated 1.5°C pathways assessed in this chapter

characteristics, such as radiative forcing (Masui et al., 2011; Riahi et

concentrations (van Vuuren et al., 2007, 2011; Clarke et al., 2014) or
associated temperature outcomes (Meinshausen et al., 2009; Rogelj
et al., 2011; Luderer et al., 2013). These attributes can be used to
derive geophysical relationships for specific pathway classes, such as
cumulative CO, emissions compatible with a specific level of warming,
also known as ‘carbon budgets’ (Meinshausen et al., 2009; Rogelj et al.,
2011; Stocker et al, 2013; Friedlingstein et al, 2014a), the consistent
contributions of non-CO, GHGs and aerosols to the remaining carbon

"Most 1.5°C-consistent pathways exhibit a peak in temperature by mid-
century whereas 2°C-consistent pathways generally peak after 2050
(Supplementary Material 2.5M.1.4). The peak in median temperature
in the various pathway categories occurs about ten years before
reaching net zero CO, emissions due to strongly reduced annual
CO, emissions and deep reductions in CHs emissions (Section 2.3.3).
The two reduced-complexity climate models used in this assessment
suggest that virtually all available 1.5°C-consistent pathways peak
and then decline global mean temperature, but with varying rates
of temperature decline after the peak (Figure 2.1). The estimated
decadal rates of temperature change by the end of the century are
smaller than the amplitude of the climate variability as assessed in AR5
(1 standard deviation of about +0.1°C), which hence complicates the
detection of a global peak and decline of warming in observations on
time scales of one to two decades (Bindoff et al., 2013). In comparison,
many pathways limiting warming to 2°C or higher by 2100 still have
noticeable increasing trends at the end of the century, and thus imply
continued warming.

This includes low-demand scenarios (Grubler et al., 2018; van Vuuren

development goals (Bertram et al, 2018), scenarios with restricted

"Non-CO, climate forcers exhibit a greater geographical variation in

the relative uncertainty of the temperature pathways associated with
low emission scenarios compared to high emission scenarios (Clarke

of temperature change and other climate responses, especially those
related to precipitation, depend significantly on the forcing mechanism
(Myhre et al., 2013; Shindell et al, 2015; Marvel et al., 2016; Samset et

"Figure 2.2 shows that there are substantial differences in the evolution
of estimated effective radiative forcing of non-CO, forcers between

the FAIR model and the recent observed trends of 0.2°C per decade
reported in Chapter 1 (Figure 2.1, Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.1,

MAGICC compared to either FAIR or the ARS best estimate, though it
is still well within the AR5 uncertainty range (Supplementary Material

methane forcing by 25%. This revision is used in the FAIR but not in the

"Climate sensitivity uncertainty impacts future projections as well as
carbon-budget estimates (Schneider et al, 2017). ARS assessed the
equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) to be /ikely in the 1.5°-4.5°C
range, extremely unlikely less than 1°C and very unlikely greater
than 6°C. The lower bound of this estimate is lower than the range
of CMIP5 models (Collins et al., 2013). The evidence for the 1.5°C
lower bound on ECS in AR5 was based on analysis of energy-budget
changes over the historical period. Work since AR5 has suggested
that the climate sensitivity inferred from such changes has been
lower than the 2 x CO, climate sensitivity for known reasons (Forster,

upwards, which would decrease the chances of limiting warming
below 1.5°C in assessed pathways. However, such a reassessment has
been challenged (Lewis and Curry, 2018), albeit from a single line of
evidence. Nevertheless, it is premature to make a major revision to the
lower bound. The evidence for a possible revision of the upper bound
on ECS is less clear, with cases argued from different lines of evidence
for both decreasing (Lewis and Curry, 2015, 2018; Cox et al, 2018)
and increasing (Brown and Caldeira, 2017) the bound presented in the
literature. The tools used in this chapter employ ECS ranges consistent
with the AR5 assessment. The MAGICC ECS distribution has not been
selected to explicitly reflect this but is nevertheless consistent (Rogelj
et al., 2014a). The FAIR model used here to estimate carbon budgets
explicitly constructs log-normal distributions of ECS and transient
climate response based on a multi-parameter fit to the AR5 assessed
ranges of climate sensitivity and individual historic effective radiative
forcings (Smith et al., 2018) (Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.1.1).

as from multi-gas and aerosol scenarios. Some published estimates
of carbon budgets compatible with 1.5°C or 2°C refer to budgets
for CO,-induced warming only, and hence do not take into account
the contribution of non-CO, climate forcers (Allen et al. 2009;

"Matthews et al., 2009; Zickfeld et al., 2009; IPCC, 2013a). However,
because the projected changes in non-CO, climate forcers tend to
amplify future warming, CO,-only carbon budgets overestimate the
total net cumulative carbon emissions compatible with 1.5°C or 2°C
(Friedlingstein et al., 2014a; Rogelj et al., 2016b; Matthews et al., 2017;

"from both models (MacDougall et al., 2015; Burke et al, 2017; Lowe
and Bernie, 2018) and field studies (like Schadel et al., 2014; Schuur et
al., 2015) shows high agreement that permafrost thawing will release
both CO, and CH, as the Earth warms, amplifying global warming. This
thawing could also release N,O (Voigt et al., 2017a, b). Field, laboratory
and modelling studies estimate that the vulnerable fraction in
permafrost is about 5-15% of the permafrost soil carbon (~5300-5600
GtCO, in Schuur et al., 2015) and that carbon emissions are expected to
occur beyond 2100 because of system inertia and the large proportion
of slowly decomposing carbon in permafrost (Schadel et al, 2014).
Published model studies suggest that a large part of the carbon release
to the atmosphere is in the form of CO, (Schadel et al., 2016), while the
amount of CH4 released by permafrost thawing is estimated to be much
smaller than that CO,. Cumulative CH, release by 2100 under RCP2.6
ranges from 0.13 to 0.45 Gt of methane (Burke et al., 2012; Schneider
von Deimling et al, 2012, 2015), with fluxes being the highest in the
middle of the century because of maximum thermokarst lake extent by
mid-century (Schneider von Deimling et al., 2015).

"Since the ARS, several approaches have been proposed to estimate
carbon budgets compatible with 1.5°C or 2°C. Most of these
approaches indirectly rely on the approximate linear relationship
between peak global mean temperature and cumulative emissions
of carbon (the transient climate response to cumulative emissions of
carbon, TCRE) (Collins et al., 2013; Friedlingstein et al., 2014a; Rogelj et
al., 2016b), whereas others base their estimates on equilibrium climate
sensitivity (Schneider et al., 2017). The AR5 employed two approaches
to determine carbon budgets. Working Group | (WGI) computed
carbon budgets from 2011 onwards for various levels of warming
relative to the 1861-1880 period using RCP8.5 (Meinshausen et al.,
2011b; Stocker et al, 2013), whereas WGIll estimated their budgets
from a set of available pathways that were assessed to have a >50%
probability to exceed 1.5°C by mid-century, and return to 1.5°C or
below in 2100 with greater than 66% probability (Clarke et al., 2014).
These differences made AR5 WGI and WGIll carbon budgets difficult to
compare as they are calculated over different time periods, are derived
from a different sets of multi-gas and aerosol emission scenarios,
and use different concepts of carbon budgets (exceedance for WGI,
avoidance for WGIll) (Rogelj et al., 2016b; Matthews et al., 2017).

"Since the AR5, many estimates of the remaining carbon budget for
1.5°C have been published (Friedlingstein et al, 2014a; MacDougall
et al, 2015; Peters, 2016; Rogelj et al., 2016b, 2018; Matthews et al.,
2017; Millar et al., 2017; Goodwin et al., 2018b; Kriegler et al., 2018b;

2018; Schurer et al., 2018; Séférian et al., 2018; Tokarska and Gillett,
2018; Tokarska et al, 2018). These estimates cover a wide range as a
result of differences in the models used, and of methodological choices,
as well as physical uncertainties. Some estimates are exclusively model-
based while others are based on observations or on a combination of
both. Remaining carbon budgets limiting warming below 1.5°C or 2°C
that are derived from Earth system models of intermediate complexity
(MacDougall et al., 2015; Goodwin et al., 2018a), IAMs (Luderer et al.,
2018; Rogelj et al., 2018), or are based on Earth-system model results
(Lowe and Bernie, 2018; Séférian et al., 2018; Tokarska and Gillett,
2018) give remaining carbon budgets of the same order of magnitude
as the IPCC ARS Synthesis Report (SYR) estimates (IPCC, 2014a).
This is unsurprising as similar sets of models were used for the AR5
(IPCC, 2013b). The range of variation across models stems mainly from
either the inclusion or exclusion of specific Earth system feedbacks
(MacDougall et al., 2015; Burke et al., 2017; Lowe and Bernie, 2018) or
different budget definitions (Rogelj et al., 2018).

"In contrast to the model-only estimates discussed above and employed
in the ARS, this report additionally uses observations to inform its
evaluation of the remaining carbon budget. Table 2.2 shows that the
assessed range of remaining carbon budgets consistent with 1.5°C
or 2°C is larger than the AR5 SYR estimate and is part way towards
estimates constrained by recent observations (Millar et al, 2017;
Goodwin et al., 2018a; Tokarska and Gillett, 2018). Figure 2.3 illustrates
that the change since ARS is, in very large part, due to the application
of a more recent observed baseline to the historic temperature change
and cumulative emissions; here adopting the baseline period of 2006-
2015 (see Chapter 1, Section 1.2.1). AR5 SYR Figures SPM.10 and 2.3
already illustrated the discrepancy between models and observations,
but did not apply this as a correction to the carbon budget because they
were being used to illustrate the overall linear relationship between
warming and cumulative carbon emissions in the CMIP5 models since
1870, and were not specifically designed to quantify residual carbon
budgets relative to the present for ambitious temperature goals. The
ARS SYR estimate was also dependent on a subset of Earth system
models illustrated in Figure 2.3 of this report. Although, as outlined
below and in Table 2.2, considerably uncertainties remain, there is high
agreement across various lines of evidence assessed in this report that
the remaining carbon budget for 1.5°C or 2°C would be larger than
the estimates at the time of the AR5. However, the overall remaining
budget for 2100 is assessed to be smaller than that derived from the
recent observational-informed estimates, as Earth system feedbacks
such as permafrost thawing reduce the budget applicable to centennial
scales (see Section 2.2.2.2).

on multiple lines of evidence, AR5 WGI assessed a likely range for
TCRE of 0.2°-0.7°C per 1000 GtCO, (Collins et al. 2013). The TCRE
of the CMIP5 Earth system models ranges from 0.23°C to 0.66°C
per 1000 GtCO, (Gillett et al, 2013). At the same time, studies using
observational constraints find best estimates of TCRE of 0.35°-0.41°C
per 1000 GtCO, (Matthews et al., 2009; Gillett et al., 2013; Tachiiri et

to use the assessed ARS TCRE range under the working assumption
that TCRE is normally distributed (Stocker et al., 2013). Observation-
based estimates have reported log-normal distributions of TCRE (Millar
and Friedlingstein, 2018). Assuming a log-normal instead of normal
distribution of the assessed ARS TCRE range would result in about a
200 GtCO, increase for the median budget estimates but only about
half at the 67th percentile, while historical temperature uncertainty

no climate mitigation to find a variation due to non-CO, contributions
of about +33% for a 2°C carbon budget. Rogelj et al. (2016b) showed
no particular bias in non-CO, radiative forcing or warming at the time
of exceedance of 2°C or at peak warming between scenarios with
increasing emissions and strongly mitigated scenarios (consistent
with Stocker et al., 2013). However, clear differences of the non-
CO, warming contribution at the time of deriving a 2°C-consistent
carbon budget were reported for the four RCPs. Although the spread
in non-CO, forcing across scenarios can be smaller in absolute terms
at lower levels of cumulative emissions, it can be larger in relative
terms compared to the remaining carbon budget (Stocker et al., 2013;
Friedlingstein et al., 2014a; Rogelj et al, 2016b). Tokarska and Gillett

of non-CO, GHGs (Sections 2.2.1, 2.3.3). This non-CO, contribution
at the time of net zero CO, emissions varies by about +0.1°C across
scenarios, resulting in a carbon budget uncertainty of about +250
GtCO,, and takes into account marked reductions in methane emissions
(Section 2.3.3). If these reductions are not achieved, remaining carbon
budgets are further reduced. Uncertainties in the non-CO, forcing and
temperature response are asymmetric and can influence the remaining
carbon budget by —400 to +200 GtCO,, with the uncertainty in aerosol
radiative forcing being the largest contributing factor (Table 2.2). The
MAGICC and FAIR models in their respective parameter setups and
model versions used to assess the non-CO, warming contribution give
noticeable different non-CO, effective radiative forcing and warming
for the same scenarios while both being within plausible ranges of
future response (Figure 2.2 and Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.1,

of their results, so it is assumed that both are equally representative
of possible futures. Their non-CO, warming estimates are therefore
averaged for the carbon budget assessment and their differences used
to guide the uncertainty assessment of the role of non-CO, forcers.
Nevertheless, the findings are robust enough to give high confidence
that the changing emissions of non-CO, forcers (particularly the
reduction in cooling aerosol precursors) cause additional near-term
warming and reduce the remaining carbon budget compared to the

"over land to estimate global surface temperature change since pre-
industrial. The global warming from the pre-industrial period until the
2006-2015 reference period is estimated to amount to 0.97°C with
an uncertainty range of about +0.1°C (see Chapter 1, Section 1.2.1).
Three methodological improvements lead to these estimates of the
remaining carbon budget being about 300 GtCO, larger than those
reported in Table 2.2 of the IPCC AR5 SYR (IPCC, 2014a) (medium
confidence). The AR5 used 15 Earth System Models (ESM) and 5
Earth-system Models of Intermediate Complexity (EMIC) to derive an
estimate of the remaining carbon budget. Their approach hence made
implicit assumptions about the level of warming to date, the future
contribution of non-CO, emissions, and the temperature response
to CO, (TCRE). In this report, each of these aspects are considered
explicitly. When estimating global warming until the 2006-2015
reference period as a blend of near-surface air temperature over land
and sea-ice regions, and sea-surface temperature over open ocean,
by averaging the four global mean surface temperature time series
listed in Chapter 1 Section 1.2.1, the global warming would amount
to 0.87°C +0.1°C. Using the latter estimate of historical warming and
projecting global warming using global near-surface air temperatures
from model projections leads to remaining carbon budgets for limiting
global warming to 1.5°C of 1080, 770, and 570 GtCO, for the 33rd,
50th, and 67th percentile of TCRE, respectively. Note that future
research and ongoing observations over the next years will provide a
better indication as to how the 2006-2015 base period compares with
the long-term trends and might affect the budget estimates. Similarly,
improved understanding in Earth system feedbacks would result in a
better quantification of their impacts on remaining carbon budgets for
1.5°C and 2°C.

temperature overshoot (MacDougall et al., 2015). Although potentially
large for scenarios with large overshoot (MacDougall et al. 2015), this
path-dependence of carbon budgets has not been well quantified for
1.5°C- and 2°C-consistent scenarios and as such remains an important
knowledge gap. This assessment does not explicitly account for path
dependence but takes it into consideration for its overall confidence
assessment.

"In summary, although robust physical understanding underpins the
carbon budget concept, relative uncertainties become larger as a
specific temperature limit is approached. For the budget, applicable
to the mid-century, the main uncertainties relate to the TCRE, non-CO,
emissions, radiative forcing and response. For 2100, uncertain Earth
system feedbacks such as permafrost thawing would further reduce
the available budget. The remaining budget is also conditional upon
the choice of baseline, which is affected by uncertainties in both
historical emissions, and in deriving the estimate of globally averaged
human-induced warming. As a result, only medium confidence can be
assigned to the assessed remaining budget values for 1.5°C and 2.0°C

anthropogenic CO, emissions since the pre-industrial period are
estimated to have amounted to approximately 2200 +320 GtCO,

"Remaining carbon budgets are further influenced by Earth system
feedbacks not accounted for in CMIP5 models, such as the permafrost
carbon feedback (Friedlingstein et al., 2014b; MacDougall et al., 2015;
Burke et al., 2017; Lowe and Bernie, 2018), and their influence on
the TCRE. Lowe and Bernie (2018) used a simple climate sensitivity
scaling approach to estimate that Earth system feedbacks (such as
CO, released by permafrost thawing or methane released by wetlands)
could reduce carbon budgets for 1.5°C and 2°C by roughly 100
GtCO, on centennial time scales. Their findings are based on an older
understanding of Earth system feedbacks (Arneth et al, 2010). This
estimate is broadly supported by more recent analysis of individual
feedbacks. Schadel et al. (2014) suggest an upper bound of 24.4 PgC
(90 GtCO,) emitted from carbon release from permafrost over the next
forty years for a RCP4.5 scenario. Burke et al. (2017) use a single model
to estimate permafrost emissions between 0.3 and 0.6 GtCO, y"" from
the point of 1.5°C stabilization, which would reduce the budget by
around 20 GtCO, by 2100. Comyn-Platt et al. (2018) include carbon
and methane emissions from permafrost and wetlands and suggest the
1.5°C remaining carbon budget is reduced by 116 GtCO,,. Additionally,
Mahowald et al. (2017) find there is possibility of 0.5-1.5 GtCO, y""
being released from aerosol-biogeochemistry changes if aerosol
emissions cease. In summary, these additional Earth system feedbacks
taken together are assessed to reduce the remaining carbon budget
applicable to 2100 by an order of magnitude of 100 GtCO,, compared
to the budgets based on the assumption of a constant TCRE presented
in Table 2.2 (limited evidence, medium agreement), leading to overall
medium confidence in their assessed impact. After 2100, the impact
of additional Earth system feedbacks is expected to further reduce the
remaining carbon budget (medium confidence).

GHG-emitting sectors and their interactions. Such integrated pathways
allow the exploration of the whole-system transformation, and hence
provide the context in which the detailed sectoral transformations
assessed in Section 2.4 of this chapter are taking place.

"Limiting global mean temperature increase at any level requires global
CO, emissions to become net zero at some point in the future (Zickfeld
et al., 2009; Collins et al., 2013). At the same time, limiting the residual
warming of short-lived non-CO, emissions can be achieved by reducing
their annual emissions as much as possible (Section 2.2, Cross-Chapter
Box 2 in Chapter 1). This would require large-scale transformations of
the global energy—agriculture—land-economy system, affecting the
way in which energy is produced, agricultural systems are organized,
and food, energy and materials are consumed (Clarke et al., 2014). This
section assesses key properties of pathways consistent with limiting
global mean temperature to 1.5°C relative to pre-industrial levels,
including their underlying assumptions and variations.

"Earlier assessments have highlighted that there is no single pathway to
achieve a specific climate objective (e.g., Clarke et al., 2014). Pathways
depend on the underlying development processes, and societal
choices, which affect the drivers of projected future baseline emissions.
Furthermore, societal choices also affect climate change solutions in
pathways, like the technologies that are deployed, the scale at which
they are deployed, or whether solutions are globally coordinated.
A key finding is that 1.5°C-consistent pathways could be identified
under a considerable range of assumptions in model studies despite
the tightness of the 1.5°C emissions budget (Figures 2.4, 2.5) (Rogelj
et al., 2018).

"The pathway literature is assessed in two ways in this section. First,
various insights on specific questions reported by studies can be assessed
to identify robust or divergent findings. Second, the combined body of
scenarios can be assessed to identify salient features of pathways in line
with a specific climate goal across a wide range of models. The latter
can be achieved by assessing pathways available in the database to
this assessment (Section 2.1, Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.2—4). The
ensemble of scenarios available to this assessment is an ensemble of
opportunity: it is a collection of scenarios from a diverse set of studies
that was not developed with a common set of questions and a statistical
analysis of outcomes in mind. This means that ranges can be useful to
identify robust and sensitive features across available scenarios and
contributing modelling frameworks, but do not lend themselves to a
statistical interpretation. To understand the reasons underlying the ranges,
an assessment of the underlying scenarios and studies is required. To this
end, this section highlights illustrative pathway archetypes that help to
clarify the variation in assessed ranges for 1.5°C-consistent pathways.

"Baseline projections for energy-related GHG emissions are sensitive to
economic growth assumptions, while baseline projections for land-use
emissions are more directly affected by population growth (assuming
unchanged land productivity and per capita demand for agricultural
products) (Kriegler et al., 2016). SSP-based modelling studies of
mitigation pathways have identified high challenges to mitigation
for worlds with a focus on domestic issues and regional security
combined with high population growth (SSP3), and for worlds with
rapidly growing resource and fossil-fuel intensive consumption (SSP5)
(Riahi et al., 2017). No model could identify a 2°C-consistent pathway
for SSP3, and high mitigation costs were found for SSP5. This picture
translates to 1.5°C-consistent pathways that have to remain within
even tighter emissions constraints (Rogelj et al., 2018). No model
found a 1.5°C-consistent pathway for SSP3 and some models could not
identify 1.5°C-consistent pathways for SSP5 (2 of 4 models, compared
to 1 of 4 models for 2°C-consistent pathways). The modelling analysis
also found that the effective control of land-use emissions becomes
even more critical in 1.5°C-consistent pathways. Due to high inequality
levels in SSP4, land use can be less well managed. This caused 2 of
3 models to no longer find an SSP4-based 1.5°C-consistent pathway
even though they identified SSP4-based 2°C-consistent pathways at
relatively moderate mitigation costs (Riahi et al, 2017). Rogelj et al.

"future population levels, secular trends in economic growth and
income convergence, behavioural change and technological progress.
These dimensions have been recently explored in the context of
the SSPs (Kriegler et al., 2012; O'Neill et al, 2014), which provide
narratives (O'Neill et al., 2017) and quantifications (Crespo Cuaresma,
2017; Dellink et al., 2017; KC and Lutz, 2017; Leimbach et al., 2017;
Riahi et al. 2017) of different world futures across which scenario
dimensions are varied to explore differential challenges to adaptation
and mitigation (Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1). This framework
is increasingly adopted by IAMs to systematically explore the impact
of socio-economic assumptions on mitigation pathways (Riahi et al.,
2017), including 1.5°C-consistent pathways (Rogelj et al., 2018). The
narratives describe five worlds (SSP1—5) with different socio-economic
predispositions to mitigate and adapt to climate change (Table 2.3). As
aresult, population and economic growth projections can vary strongly
across integrated scenarios, including available 1.5°C-consistent
pathways (Figure 2.4). For example, based on alternative future
fertility, mortality, migration and educational assumptions, population
projections vary between 8.5 and 10.0 billion people by 2050 and
between 6.9 and 12.6 billion people by 2100 across the SSPs. An
important factor for these differences is future female educational
attainment, with higher attainment leading to lower fertility rates and
therefore decreased population growth up to a level of 1 billion people
by 2050 (Lutz and KC, 2011; Snopkowski et al., 2016; KC and Lutz,
2017). Consistent with population development, GDP per capita also
varies strongly in SSP baselines, ranging from about 20 to more than
50 thousand USD2010 per capita in 2050 (in purchasing power parity
values, PPP), in part driven by assumptions on human development,
technological progress and development convergence between and
within regions (Crespo Cuaresma, 2017; Dellink et al., 2017; Leimbach
et al., 2017). Importantly, none of the GDP projections in the mitigation
pathway literature assessed in this chapter included the feedback of
climate damages on economic growth (Hsiang et al., 2017).

"This elicitation (Supplementary Material 2.$M.1.2) confirms that
IAMs cover most supply-side mitigation options on the process level,
while many demand-side options are treated as part of underlying
assumptions, which can be varied (Clarke et al, 2014). In recent years,
there has been increasing attention on improving the modelling
of integrating variable renewable energy into the power system

of behavioural change and other factors influencing future demand

on the many diverse CDR options only recently started to develop
strongly (Minx et al., 2017) (see Chapter 4, Section 4.3.7 for a detailed
assessment), and hence these options are only partially included in
IAM analyses. IAMs mostly incorporate afforestation and bioenergy
with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and only in few cases also
include direct air capture with CCS (DACCS) (Chen and Tavoni, 2013;

are a few potentially disruptive technologies that are typically not yet
well covered in IAMs and that have the potential to alter the shape of
mitigation pathways beyond the ranges in the IAM-based literature.
Those are also included in Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.2. The
configuration of carbon-neutral energy systems projected in mitigation
pathways can vary widely, but they all share a substantial reliance
on bioenergy under the assumption of effective land-use emissions
control. There are other configurations with less reliance on bioenergy
that are not yet comprehensively covered by global mitigation pathway
modelling. One approach is to dramatically reduce and electrify energy
demand for transportation and manufacturing to levels that make
residual non-electric fuel use negligible or replaceable by limited
amounts of electrolytic hydrogen. Such an approach is presented in
a first-of-its kind low-energy-demand scenario (Grubler et al, 2018)
which is part of this assessment. Other approaches rely less on energy
demand reductions, but employ cheap renewable electricity to push
the boundaries of electrification in the industry and transport sectors
(Breyer et al., 2017; Jacobson, 2017). In addition, these approaches
deploy renewable-based Power-2-X (read: Power to ""x"") technologies
to substitute residual fossil-fuel use (Brynolf et al., 2018). An important
element of carbon-neutral Power-2-X applications is the combination
of hydrogen generated from renewable electricity and CO, captured
from the atmosphere (Zeman and Keith, 2008). Alternatively, algae
are considered as a bioenergy source with more limited implications

"Be it for the energy, transport, buildings, industry, or AFOLU sector,
the literature shows that multiple options and choices are available in
each of these sectors to pursue stringent emissions reductions (Section
2.3.1.2, Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.2, Chapter 4, Section 4.3).
Because the overall emissions total under a pathway is limited by a
geophysical carbon budget (Section 2.2.2), choices in one sector affect
the efforts that are required from others (Clarke et al, 2014). A robust
feature of 1.5°C-consistent pathways, as highlighted by the set of
pathway archetypes in Figure 2.5, isa virtually full decarbonization of the
power sector around mid-century, a feature shared with 2°C-consistent
pathways. The additional emissions reductions in 1.5°C-consistent
compared to 2°C-consistent pathways come predominantly from the
transport and industry sectors (Luderer et al., 2018). Emissions can be
apportioned differently across sectors, for example, by focussing on
reducing the overall amount of CO, produced in the energy end-use
sectors, and using limited contributions of CDR by the AFOLU sector
(afforestation and reforestation, S1 and LED pathways in Figure 2.5)
(Grubler et al., 2018; Holz et al., 2018b; van Vuuren et al., 2018), or
by being more lenient about the amount of CO, that continues to
be produced in the above-mentioned end-use sectors (both by 2030
and mid-century) and strongly relying on technological CDR options

"1.5°C-consistent pathways are characterized by a rapid phase out
of CO, emissions and deep emissions reductions in other GHGs and
climate forcers (Section 2.2.2 and 2.3.3). This is achieved by broad
transformations in the energy; industry; transport; buildings; and
agriculture, forestry and other land-use (AFOLU) sectors (Section 2.4)
(Bauer et al., 2018; Grubler et al, 2018; Holz et al, 2018b; Kriegler

2018; van Vuuren et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018). Here we assess
1.5°C-consistent pathways with and without overshoot during
the 21st century. One study also explores pathways overshooting
1.5°C for longer than the 21st century (Akimoto et al., 2017), but
these are not considered 1.5°C-consistent pathways in this report
(Chapter 1, Section 1.1.3). This subsection summarizes robust and
varying properties of 1.5°C-consistent pathways regarding system
transformations, emission reductions and overshoot. It aims to provide
an introduction to the detailed assessment of the emissions evolution
(Section 2.3.3), CDR deployment (Section 2.3.4), energy (Section 2.4.1,
2.4.2), industry (2.4.3.1), buildings (2.4.3.2), transport (2.4.3.3) and
land-use transformations (Section 2.4.4) in 1.5°C-consistent pathways.

"Furthermore, a range of measures could radically reduce agricultural
and land-use emissions and are not yet well-covered in IAM modelling.
This includes plant-based proteins (Joshi and Kumar, 2015) and cultured
meat (Post, 2012) with the potential to substitute for livestock products
at much lower GHG footprints (Tuomisto and Teixeira de Mattos, 2011).
Large-scale use of synthetic or algae-based proteins for animal feed
could free pasture land for other uses (Madeira et al., 2017; Pikaar et al.,
2018). Novel technologies such as methanogen inhibitors and vaccines
(Wedlock et al., 2013; Hristov et al., 2015; Herrero et al., 2016; Subharat
et al., 2016) as well as synthetic and biological nitrification inhibitors
(Subbarao et al., 2013; Di and Cameron, 2016) could substantially
reduce future non-CO, emissions from agriculture if commercialized
successfully. Enhancing carbon sequestration in soils (Paustian et al.,
2016; Frank et al., 2017; Zomer et al., 2017) can provide the dual benefit
of CDR and improved soil quality. A range of conservation, restoration
and land management options can also increase terrestrial carbon
uptake (Griscom et al, 2017). In addition, the literature discusses
CDR measures to permanently sequester atmospheric carbon in rocks
(mineralization and enhanced weathering, see Chapter 4, Section
4.3.7) as well as carbon capture and usage in long-lived products like
plastics and carbon fibres (Mazzotti et al., 2005; Hartmann et al., 2013).
Progress in the understanding of the technical viability, economics and
sustainability of these ways to achieve and maintain carbon neutral
energy and land use can affect the characteristics, costs and feasibility
of 1.5°C-consistent pathways significantly.

"Besides assumptions related to socio-economic drivers and mitigation
technology, scenarios are also subject to assumptions about the
mitigation policies that can be put in place. Mitigation policies can
either be applied immediately in scenarios or follow staged or delayed
approaches. Policies can span many sectors (e.g., economy-wide carbon
pricing), or policies can be applicable to specific sectors only (like the
energy sector) with other sectors (e.g., the agricultural or the land-use
sector) treated differently. These variations can have an important
impact on the ability of models to generate scenarios compatible with
stringent climate targets like 1.5°C (Luderer et al., 2013; Rogelj et al.,
2013b; Bertram et al., 2015b; Kriegler et al., 2018a; Michaelowa et al.,
2018). In the scenario ensemble available to this assessment, several
variations of near-term mitigation policy implementation can be found:
immediate and cross-sectoral global cooperation from 2020 onward
towards a global climate objective, a phase-in of globally coordinated
mitigation policy from 2020 to 2040, and a more short-term oriented
and regionally diverse global mitigation policy, following NDCs until
2030 (Kriegler et al., 2018a; Luderer et al, 2018; McCollum et al., 2018;
Rogelj et al, 2018; Strefler et al, 2018b). For example, the above-

policies until 2020, and vary in global convergence thereafter (Kriegler

Rogelj et al, 2018). Major drivers of these differences are assumptions
about energy and food demand and the stringency of near-term climate
policy (see the difference between early action in the scenarios S1,
LED and more moderate action until 2030 in the scenarios $2, $5).
Furthermore, the carbon budget in each of these pathways depends
also on the non-CO, mitigation measures implemented in each of them,
particularly for agricultural emissions (Sections 2.2.2, 2.3.3) (Gernaat et
al., 2015). Those pathways differ not only in terms of their deployment
of mitigation and CDR measures (Sections 2.3.4 and 2.4), but also in
terms of the resulting temperature overshoot (Figure 2.1). Furthermore,
they have very different implications for the achievement of sustainable
development objectives, as further discussed in Section 2.5.3.

"exceeding this remaining carbon budget at some point in time would
give a one-in-three (one-in-two) chance that the 1.5°C limit is overshot

CO, emissions in 2017 around 42 + 3 GtCO, yr"" (Jackson et al. 2017;
Le Quéré et al., 2018). Committed fossil-fuel emissions from existing
fossil-fuel infrastructure as of 2010 have been estimated at around
500 + 200 GtCO, (with about 200 GtCO, already emitted through
2017) (Davis and Caldeira, 2010). Coal-fired power plants contribute
the largest part. Committed emissions from existing coal-fired power
plants built through the end of 2016 are estimated to add up to roughly
200 GtCO,, and a further 100-150 GtCO, from coal-fired power plants
under construction or planned (Gonzalez-Eguino et al., 2017; Edenhofer
et al., 2018). However, there has been a marked slowdown of planned
coal-power projects in recent years, and some estimates indicate that
the committed emissions from coal plants that are under construction
or planned have halved since 2015 (Shearer et al., 2018). Despite these
uncertainties, the committed fossil-fuel emissions are assessed to
already amount to more than two thirds (half) of the remaining carbon
budget.

"To compare these numbers with the remaining carbon budget, CO,
emissions from agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) need
to be taken into account. In many of the 1.5°C-consistent pathways,
AFOLU CO, emissions reach zero at or before mid-century and then
turn to negative values (Table 2.4). This means human changes to the
land lead to atmospheric carbon being stored in plants and soils. This
needs to be distinguished from the natural CO, uptake by land, which is
not accounted for in the anthropogenic AFOLU CO, emissions reported
in the pathways. Given the difference in estimating the ‘anthropogenic’
sink between countries and the global integrated assessment and
carbon modelling community (Grassi et al., 2017), the AFOLU CO,
estimates included here are not necessarily directly comparable with
countries’ estimates at global level. The cumulated amount of AFOLU

"of 650-1270 GtCO, for the period 2018-2100 (5th-95th percentile;
median 950 GtCO,) in 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot.
The lower end of the range is close to what emerges from a scenario
of transformative change that halves CO, emissions every decade
from 2020 to 2050 (Rockstrém et al., 2017). All these estimates are
above the remaining carbon budget for a one-in-two chance of limiting
warming below 1.5°C without overshoot, including the low end of the
hypothetical sensitivity analysis of Kriegler et al. (2018b), who assumes
75 Gt AFOLU CO, emissions adding to a total of 575 GtCO, gross CO,
emissions. As almost no cases have been identified that keep gross CO,
emissions within the remaining carbon budget for a one-in-two chance
of limiting warming to 1.5°C, and based on current understanding of
the geophysical response and its uncertainties, the available evidence
indicates that avoiding overshoot of 1.5°C will require some type of
CDR in a broad sense, e.g., via net negative AFOLU CO, emissions
(medium confidence). (Table 2.2).
"	Text
"Most 1.5°C-consistent pathways show more stringent emissions
reductions by 2030 than implied by the NDCs (Section 2.3.5) The lower
end of those pathways reach down to below 20 GtCO, yr in 2030
(Section 2.3.3, Table 2.4), less than half of what is implied by the NDCs.
Whether such pathways will be able to limit warming to 1.5°C without
overshoot will depend on whether cumulative net CO, emissions over
the 21st century can be kept below the remaining carbon budget at
any time. Net global CO, emissions are derived from the gross amount
of CO, that humans annually emit into the atmosphere reduced by the
amount of anthropogenic CDR in each year. New research has looked
more closely at the amount and the drivers of gross CO, emissions
from fossil-fuel combustion and industrial processes (FFI) in deep
mitigation pathways (Luderer et al, 2018), and found that the larger
part of remaining CO, emissions come from direct fossil-fuel use in
the transport and industry sectors, while residual energy supply sector
emissions (mostly from the power sector) are limited by a rapid approach
to net zero CO, emissions until mid-century. The 1.5°C pathways with
no or limited (<0.1°C) overshoot that were reported in the scenario
database project remaining FFI CO, emissions of 610-1260 GtCO, over
the period 2018-2100 (Sth—95th percentile range; median: 880 GtCO,).
Kriegler et al. (2018b) conducted a sensitivity analysis that explores the
four central options for reducing fossil-fuel emissions: lowering energy
demand, electrifying energy services, decarbonizing the power sector
and decarbonizing non-electric fuel use in energy end-use sectors. By
exploring these options to their extremes, they found a lowest value
of 500 GtCO, (2018-2100) gross fossil-fuel CO, emissions for the
hypothetical case of aligning the strongest assumptions for all four
mitigation options. The two lines of evidence and the fact that available
1.5°C pathways cover a wide range of assumptions (Section 2.3.1)
give a robust indication of a lower limit of about 500 GtCO, remaining
fossil-fuel and industry CO, emissions in the 21st century.
"	Text
"Net CO, emissions can fall below gross CO, emissions, if CDR is
brought into the mix. Studies have looked at mitigation and CDR
in combination to identify strategies for limiting warming to 1.5°C
(Sanderson et al., 2016; Ricke et al, 2017). CDR, which may include
net negative AFOLU CO, emissions, is deployed by all 1.5°C-consistent
pathways available to this assessment, but the scale of deployment
and choice of CDR measures varies widely (Section 2.3.4). Furthermore,
no CDR technology has been deployed at scale yet, and all come with
concerns about their potential (Fuss et al., 2018), feasibility (Nemet et
al., 2018) and/or sustainability (Smith et al. 2015; Fuss et al., 2018) (see
Sections 2.3.4, 4.3.2 and 4.3.7 and Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3
for further discussion). CDR can have two very different functions in
1.5°C-consistent pathways. If deployed in the first half of the century,
before net zero CO, emissions are reached, it neutralizes some of the
remaining CO, emissions year by year and thus slows the accumulation
of CO, in the atmosphere. In this first function it can be used to remain
within the carbon budget and avoid overshoot. If CDR is deployed in the
second half of the century after carbon neutrality has been established,
it can still be used to neutralize some residual emissions from other
sectors, but also to create net negative emissions that actively draw
down the cumulative amount of CO, emissions to return below a
1.5°C warming level. In the second function, CDR enables temporary
overshoot. The literature points to strong limitations to upscaling
CDR (limiting its first abovementioned function) and to sustainability
constraints (limiting both abovementioned functions) (Fuss et al.,
2018; Minx et al, 2018; Nemet et al. 2018). Large uncertainty hence
exists about what amount of CDR could actually be available before
mid-century. Kriegler et al. (2018b) explore a case limiting CDR to
100 GtCO, until 2050, and the 1.5°C pathways with no or limited
overshoot available in the report's database project 40-260 GtCO,
CDR until the point of carbon neutrality (5th to 95th percentile; median
110 GtCO,). Because gross CO, emissions in most cases exceed the
remaining carbon budget by several hundred GtCO, and given the limits
to CDR deployment until 2050, most of the 1.5°C-consistent pathways
available to this assessment are overshoot pathways. However, the
scenario database also contains nine non-overshoot pathways that
remain below 1.5°C throughout the 21st century (Table 2.1).

as other classes with varying levels of projected overshoot (1.5°C-low-

are assessed. Subsequent sections assess long-lived climate forcers

"Kyoto-GHG emission reductions are achieved by reductions in CO,
and non-CO, GHGs. The ARS identified two primary factors that
influence the depth and timing of reductions in non-CO, Kyoto-GHG
emissions: (i) the abatement potential and costs of reducing the
emissions of these gases and (ii) the strategies that allow making
trade-offs between them (Clarke et al., 2014). Many studies indicate
low-cost, near-term mitigation options in some sectors for non-CO,
gases compared to supply-side measures for CO, mitigation (Clarke et
al., 2014). A large share of this potential is hence already exploited in
mitigation pathways in line with 2°C. At the same time, by mid-century
and beyond, estimates of further reductions of non-CO, Kyoto-GHGs —
in particular CH, and N,O — are hampered by the absence of mitigation
"	Text
"Estimates of aggregated GHG emissions in line with specific policy
choices are often compared to near-term benchmark values from
mitigation pathways to explore their consistency with long-term
climate goals (Clarke et al., 2014; UNEP, 2016, 2017; UNFCCC, 2016).
Benchmark emissions or estimates of peak years derived from IAMs
provide guidelines or milestones that are consistent with achieving a
given temperature level. While they do not set mitigation requirements
in a strict sense, exceeding these levels in a given year almost invariably
increases the mitigation challenges afterwards by increasing the rates
of change and increasing the reliance on speculative technologies,
including the possibility that its implementation becomes unachievable
(see Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1 for a discussion of feasibility
concepts) (Luderer et al, 2013; Rogelj et al., 2013b; Clarke et al., 2014;
Fawcett et al., 2015; Riahi et al., 2015; Kriegler et al., 2018a). These
trade-offs are particularly pronounced in 1.5°C pathways and are
discussed in Section 2.3.5. This section assesses Kyoto-GHG emissions
in 2030 expressed in CO, equivalent (CO,e) emissions using 100-year
global warming potentials.’
"	Text
"Appropriate benchmark values of aggregated GHG emissions depend
on a variety of factors. First and foremost, they are determined by the
desired likelihood to keep warming below 1.5°C and the extent to which
projected temporary overshoot is to be avoided (Sections 2.2, 2.3.2,
and 2.3.5). For instance, median aggregated 2030 GHG emissions are
about 10 GtCO,e yr lower in 1.5°C-low-OS compared to 1.5°C-high-
OS pathways, with respective interquartile ranges of 26-31 and 36-49
GtCO,e yr! (Table 2.4). These ranges correspond to about 25-30 and
35-48 GtCO,e yr-' in 2030, respectively, when aggregated with 100-
year Global Warming Potentials from the IPCC Second Assessment
Report. The limited evidence available for pathways aiming to limit
warming below 1.5°C without overshoot or with limited amounts of
CDR (Grubler et al., 2018; Holz et al., 2018b; van Vuuren et al., 2018)
indicates that under these conditions consistent emissions in 2030
would fall at the lower end and below the above mentioned ranges.
Due to the small number of 1.5°C pathways with no overshoot in the
report's database (Table 2.4) and the potential for a downward bias in
the selection of underlying scenario assumptions, the headline range
for 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot is also assessed to
be of the order of 25-30 GtCO,e yr’. Ranges for the 1.5°C-low-OS
and Lower-2°C classes only overlap outside their interquartile ranges,
"	Text
"Appropriate emissions benchmark values also depend on the
acceptable or desired portfolio of mitigation measures, representing
clearly identified trade-offs and choices (Sections 2.3.4, 2.4, and 2.5.3)
(Luderer et al., 2013; Rogelj et al. 2013a; Clarke et al., 2014; Krey et al.,
201 4a; Strefler et al., 2018b). For example, lower 2030 GHG emissions
correlate with a lower dependence on the future availability and
desirability of CDR (Strefler et al., 2018b). On the other hand, pathways
that assume or anticipate only limited deployment of CDR during
the 21st century imply lower emissions benchmarks over the coming
decades, which are achieved in models through further reducing
CO, emissions in the coming decades. The pathway archetypes
used in the chapter illustrate this further (Figure 2.6). Under middle-
of-the-road assumptions of technological and socioeconomic
development, pathway $2 suggests emission benchmarks of 34, 12
and —8 GtCO,e yr"" in the years 2030, 2050, and 2100, respectively.
In contrast, a pathway that further limits overshoot and aims at
eliminating the reliance on negative emissions technologies like
BECCS as well as CCS (here labelled as the LED pathway) shows
deeper emissions reductions in 2030 to limit the cumulative amount
of CO, until net zero global CO, emissions (carbon neutrality). The LED
pathway here suggests emission benchmarks of 25, 9 and 2 GtCO,e yr
in the years 2030, 2050, and 2100, respectively. However, a pathway
that allows and plans for the successful large-scale deployment of
BECCS by and beyond 2050 ($5) shows a shift in the opposite direction.
The variation within and between the abovementioned ranges of
2030 GHG benchmarks hence depends strongly on societal choices
and preferences related to the acceptability and availability of certain
technologies.

C02 emissions are projected to be markedly lower in 1.5°C-consistent
compared to 2°C-consistent pathways, this is much less the case for
methane (CH,) and nitrous-oxide (N,O) (Figures 2.6—2.7). This results
in reductions of CO, being projected to take up the largest share of
emissions reductions when moving between 1.5°C-consistent and
2°C-consistent pathways (Rogelj et al., 2015b, 2018; Luderer et al.,
2018). If additional non-CO, mitigation measures are identified and
adequately included in IAMs, they are expected to further contribute to
mitigation efforts by lowering the floor of residual non-CO, emissions.
However, the magnitude of these potential contributions has not been

"Climate effects of long-lived climate forcers (LLCFs) are dominated by
CO,, with smaller contributions of N,O and some fluorinated gases
(Myhre et al, 2013; Blanco et al. 2014). Overall net CO, emissions
in pathways are the result of a combination of various anthropogenic
contributions (Figure 2.5) (Clarke et al., 2014): (i) CO, produced by fossil-
fuel combustion and industrial processes, (ii) CO, emissions or removals
from the agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) sector, (iii)
CO, capture and sequestration (CCS) from fossil fuels or industrial
activities before it is released to the atmosphere, (iv) CO, removal by
technological means, which in current pathways is mainly achieved
by BECCS and AFOLU-related CDR, although other options could
be conceivable (see Chapter 4, Section 4.3.7). Pathways apply these
four contributions in different configurations (Figure 2.5) depending
on societal choices and preferences related to the acceptability and
availability of certain technologies, the timing and stringency of near-
term climate policy, and the ability to limit the demand that drives
baseline emissions (Marangoni et al., 2017; Riahi et al, 2017; Grubler

"As aresult of the interplay between residual CO, and non-CO, emissions
and CDR, global GHG emissions reach net zero levels at different times
in different 1.5°C-consistent pathways. Interquartile ranges of the
years in which 1.5°C-low-OS and 1.5°C-high-OS reach net zero GHG
emissions range from 2060 to 2080 (Table 2.4). A seesaw characteristic
can be found between near-term emissions reductions and the timing
of net zero GHG emissions. This is because pathways with limited
emissions reductions in the next one to two decades require net
negative CO, emissions later on (see earlier). Most 1.5°C-high-OS
pathways lead to net zero GHG emissions in approximately the third
quarter of this century, because all of them rely on significant amounts
of annual net negative CO, emissions in the second half of the
century to decline temperatures after overshoot (Table 2.4). However,
in pathways that aim at limiting overshoot as much as possible or
more slowly decline temperatures after their peak, emissions reach
the point of net zero GHG emissions slightly later or at times never.
Early emissions reductions in this case reduce the requirement for net
negative CO, emissions. Estimates of 2030 GHG emissions in line with
the current NDCs overlap with the highest quartile of 1.5°C-high-OS
pathways (Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4).
"	Text
"The development of CO, emissions in the second half of the century in
1.5°C pathways is characterized by the need to stay or return within
a carbon budget. Figure 2.6 shows net CO, and N,O emissions from
various sources in 2050 and 2100 in 1.5°C pathways in the literature.
Virtually all 1.5°C pathways obtain net negative CO, emissions at some
point during the 21st century, but the extent to which net negative
emissions are relied upon varies substantially (Figure 2.6, Table 2.4).
This net withdrawal of CO, from the atmosphere compensates for
residual long-lived non-CO, GHG emissions that also accumulate in
the atmosphere (like N20) or cancels some of the build-up of CO, due
to earlier emissions to achieve increasingly higher likelihoods that
warming stays or returns below 1.5°C (see Section 2.3.4 for a discussion
of various uses of CDR). Even non-overshoot pathways that aim at
achieving temperature stabilization would hence deploy a certain
amount of net negative CO, emissions to offset any accumulating
long-lived non-CO, GHGs. The 1.5°C overshoot pathways display
significantly larger amounts of annual net negative CO, emissions in
the second half of the century. The larger the overshoot the more net
negative CO, emissions are required to return temperatures to 1.5°C
by the end of the century (Table 2.4, Figure 2.1).
"	Text
"All 1.5°C pathways see global CO, emissions embark on a steady
decline to reach (near) net zero levels around 2050, with 1.5°C-low-
OS pathways reaching net zero CO, emissions around 2045-2055
(Table 2.4; Figure 2.5). Near-term differences between the various
pathway classes are apparent, however. For instance, Below-1.5°C and
1.5°C-low-OS pathways show a clear shift towards lower CO, emissions
in 2030 relative to other 1.5°C and 2°C pathway classes, although in all
1.5°C classes reductions are clear (Figure 2.6). These lower near-term
emissions levels are a direct consequence of the former two pathway
classes limiting cumulative CO, emissions until carbon neutrality in
order to aim for a higher probability of limiting peak warming to 1.5°C
(Section 2.2.2 and 2.3.2.2). In some cases, 1.5°C-low-OS pathways
achieve net zero CO, emissions one or two decades later, contingent on
2030 CO, emissions in the lower quartile of the literature range, that
is, below about 18 GtCO, yr-'. Median year-2030 global CO, emissions
are of the order of 5-10 GtCO, yr lower in Below-1.5°C compared
to 1.5°C-low-OS pathways, which are in turn lower than 1.5°C-high-
OS pathways (Table 2.4). Below-1.5°C and 1.5°C-low-OS pathways
combined show a decline in global net anthropogenic CO, emissions
of about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 (40-60% interquartile range).
Lower-2°C pathways show CO, emissions declining by about 25% by
2030 in most pathways (10-30% interquartile range). The 1.5°C-high-
OS pathways show emissions levels that are broadly similar to the

deployment of CDR, in particular through BECCS (Clarke et al., 2014).
This has led to increased debate about the necessity, feasibility and
desirability of large-scale CDR deployment, sometimes also called
‘negative emissions technologies’ in the literature (Fuss et al., 2014;

"a result, sizeable residual N,O emissions are currently projected to
continue throughout the century, and measures to effectively mitigate
them will be of continued relevance for 1.5°C societies. Finally, the
reduction of nitrogen use and N,O emissions from agriculture is already
a present-day concern due to unsustainable levels of nitrogen pollution
(Bodirsky et al., 2012). Section 2.4.4 provides a further assessment of
the agricultural non-CO, emissions reduction potential.

"80% being suggested (Stohl et al., 2015; Klimont et al., 2017). Because
the dominant sources of certain aerosol mixtures are emitted during
the combustion of fossil fuels, the rapid phase-out of unabated fossil
fuels to avoid CO, emissions would also result in removal of these
either warming or cooling SLCF air-pollutant species. Furthermore,
SLCFs are also reduced by efforts to reduce particulate air pollution.
For example, year-2050 SO, emissions (precursors of sulphate aerosol)
in 1.5°C-consistent pathways are about 75-85% lower than their 2010
levels. Some caveats apply, for example, if residential biomass use
would be encouraged in industrialised countries in stringent mitigation
pathways without appropriate pollution control measures, aerosol
concentrations could also increase (Sand et al., 2015; Stohl et al., 2015).

"SLCFs include shorter-lived GHGs like CH, and some fluorinated gases
as well as particles (aerosols), their precursors and ozone precursors.
SLCFs are strongly mitigated in 1.5°C pathways, as is the case for
2°C pathways (Figure 2.7). SLCF emissions ranges of 1.5°C and 2°C
pathway classes strongly overlap, indicating that the main incremental
mitigation contribution between 1.5°C and 2°C pathways comes from
CO, (Luderer et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018). CO, and SLCF emissions
reductions are connected in situations where SLCF and CO, are
co-emitted by the same process, for example, with coal-fired power
plants (Shindell and Faluvegi, 2010) or within the transport sector
(Fuglestvedt et al, 2010). Many CO,-targeted mitigation measures
in industry, transport and agriculture (Sections 2.4.3-4) hence also
reduce non-CO, forcing (Rogelj et al., 2014b; Shindell et al., 2016).

"Despite the fact that methane has a strong warming effect (Myhre
et al., 2013; Etminan et al., 2016), current 1.5°C-consistent pathways
still project significant emissions of CH, by 2050, indicating only a
limited CH, mitigation potential in IAM analyses (Gernaat et al., 2015)
(Sections 2.3.1.2, 2.4.4, Table 2.SM.2). The AFOLU sector contributes an
important share of the residual CH, emissions until mid-century, with
its relative share increasing from slightly below 50% in 2010 to around
55-70% in 2030, and 60-80% in 2050 in 1.5°C-consistent pathways
(interquartile range across 1.5°C-consistent pathways for projections).
Many of the proposed measures to target CH, (Shindell et al., 2012;
Stohl et al., 2015) are included in 1.5°C-consistent pathways (Figure
2.7), though not all (Sections 2.3.1.2, 2.4.4, Table 2.5M.2). A detailed
assessment of measures to further reduce AFOLU CH, emissions has
not been conducted.

"There is a general agreement across 1.5°C-consistent pathways that
until 2030 forcing from the warming SLCFs is reduced less strongly
than the net cooling forcing from aerosol effects, compared to 2010.
As a result, the net forcing contributions from all SLCFs combined are
projected to increase slightly by about 0.2-0.3 W m~, compared to
2010. Also, by the end of the century, about 0.1-0.3 W m= of SLCF
forcing is generally currently projected to remain in 1.5°C-consistent
scenarios (Figure 2.8). This is similar to developments in 2°C-consistent
pathways (Rose et al. 2014b; Riahi et al, 2017), which show median
forcing contributions from these forcing agents that are generally no
more than 0.1 W m~ higher. Nevertheless, there can be additional gains
from targeted deeper reductions of CH, emissions and tropospheric
ozone precursors, with some scenarios projecting less than 0.1 W m2
forcing from SLCFs by 2100.
"	Text
"Overall reductions of SLCFs can have effects of either sign on
temperature depending on the balance between cooling and warming
agents. The reduction in SO, emissions is the dominant single effect as
it weakens the negative total aerosol forcing. This means that reducing
all SLCF emissions to zero would result in a short-term warming,
although this warming is unlikely to be more than 0.5°C (Section 2.2
and Figure 1.5 (Samset et al., 2018)). Because of this effect, suggestions
have been proposed that target the warming agents only (referred to
as short-lived climate pollutants or SLCPs instead of the more general
short-lived climate forcers; e.g., Shindell et al, 2012), though aerosols
are often emitted in varying mixtures of warming and cooling species
(Bond et al., 2013). Black carbon (BC) emissions reach similar levels
across 1.5°C-consistent and 2°C-consistent pathways available in the
literature, with interquartile ranges of emissions reductions across
pathways of 16-34% and 48-58% in 2030 and 2050, respectively,
relative to 2010 (Figure 2.7). Recent studies have identified further
reduction potentials for the near term, with global reductions of about

"Emissions of fluorinated gases (IPCC/TEAP, 2005; US EPA, 2013; Velders
et al, 2015; Purohit and Héglund-Isaksson, 2017) in 1.5°C-consistent
pathways are reduced by roughly 75-80% relative to 2010 levels
(interquartile range across 1.5°C-consistent pathways) in 2050,
with no clear differences between the classes. Although unabated
hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) emissions have been projected to increase
(Velders et al, 2015), the Kigali Amendment recently added HFCs to
the basket of gases controlled under the Montreal Protocol (Héglund-
Isaksson et al, 2017). As part of the larger group of fluorinated
gases, HFCs are also assumed to decline in 1.5°C-consistent
pathways. Projected reductions by 2050 of fluorinated gases under
1.5°C-consistent pathways are deeper than published estimates of
what a full implementation of the Montreal Protocol including its
Kigali Amendment would achieve (Héglund-Isaksson et al., 2017),
which project roughly a halving of fluorinated gas emissions in 2050
compared to 2010. Assuming the application of technologies that
are currently commercially available and at least to a limited extent
already tested and implemented, potential fluorinated gas emissions
reductions of more than 90% have been estimated (Héglund-Isaksson

Values show median and interquartile range across available scenarios (25th and 75th percentile given in brackets). If fewer than seven scenarios are available
(*), the minimum—maximum range is given instead. Kyoto-GHG emissions are aggregated with GWP-100 values from IPCC AR4. Emissions in 2010 for total
net CO,, CO, from fossil-fuel use and industry, and AFOLU CO, are estimated at 38.5, 33.4, and 5 GtCO, yr-', respectively (Le Quéré et al., 2018). Percentage
reduction numbers included in headline statement C.1 in the Summary for Policymakers are computed relative to 2010 emissions in each individual pathway, and
hence differ slightly from a case where reductions are computed relative to the historical 2010 emissions reported above. A difference is reported in estimating the
‘anthropogenic’ sink by countries or the global carbon modelling community (Grassi et al., 2017), and AFOLU CO, estimates reported here are thus not necessarily
comparable with countries’ estimates. Scenarios with year-2010 Kyoto-GHG emissions outside the range assessed by IPCC AR5 WGIll are excluded (IPCC, 2014b),
as are scenario duplicates that would bias ranges towards a single study.

methane, nitrous oxide and halocarbons via photocatalysis from the

"A number of approaches to actively remove carbon-dioxide from
the atmosphere are increasingly discussed in the literature (Minx
et al, 2018) (see also Chapter 4, Section 4.3.7). Approaches under
consideration include the enhancement of terrestrial and coastal
carbon storage in plants and soils such as afforestation and
reforestation (Canadell and Raupach, 2008), soil carbon enhancement
(Paustian et al., 2016; Frank et al., 2017; Zomer et al., 2017), and other
conservation, restoration, and management options for natural and
managed land (Griscom et al. 2017) and coastal ecosystems (McLeod
et al., 2011). Biochar sequestration (Woolf et al., 2010; Smith, 2016;
Werner et al, 2018) provides an additional route for terrestrial carbon
storage. Other approaches are concerned with storing atmospheric
carbon dioxide in geological formations. They include the combination
of biomass use for energy production with carbon capture and storage
(BECCS) (Obersteiner et al, 2001; Keith and Rhodes, 2002; Gough
and Upham, 2011) and direct air capture with storage (DACCS) using
chemical solvents and sorbents (Zeman and Lackner, 2004; Keith et
al., 2006; Socolow et al., 2011). Further approaches investigate the
mineralization of atmospheric carbon dioxide (Mazzotti et al, 2005;
Matter et al., 2016), including enhanced weathering of rocks (Schuiling
and Krijgsman, 2006; Hartmann et al. 2013; Strefler et al., 2018a).
A fourth group of approaches is concerned with the sequestration
of carbon dioxide in the oceans, for example by means of ocean
alkalinization (Kheshgi, 1995; Rau, 2011; Ilyina et al., 2013; Lenton et
al., 2018). The costs, CDR potential and environmental side effects of

"Integrated assessment modelling has not yet explored land conservation,
restoration and management options to remove carbon dioxide from
the atmosphere in sufficient depth, despite land management having a
potentially considerable impact on the terrestrial carbon stock (Erb et
al., 2018). Moreover, associated CDR measures have low technological
requirements, and come with potential environmental and social
co-benefits (Griscom et al., 2017). Despite the evolving capabilities of
IAMs in accounting for a wider range of CDR measures, 1.5°C-consistent
pathways assessed here continue to predominantly rely on BECCS and
afforestation/reforestation (see Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.2).
However, IAMs with spatially explicit land-use modelling include a full
accounting of land-use change emissions comprising carbon stored
in the terrestrial biosphere and soils. Net CDR in the AFOLU sector,
including but not restricted to afforestation and reforestation, can thus
in principle be inferred by comparing AFOLU CO, emissions between
a baseline scenario and a 1.5°C-consistent pathway from the same
model and study. However, baseline AFOLU CO, emissions can not only
be reduced by CDR in the AFOLU sector but also by measures to reduce
deforestation and preserve land carbon stocks. The pathway literature
and pathway data available to this assessment do not yet allow
separating the two contributions. As a conservative approximation, the
additional net negative AFOLU CO, emissions below the baseline are
taken as a proxy for AFOLU CDR in this assessment. Because this does
not include CDR that was deployed before reaching net zero AFOLU
CO, emissions, this approximation is a lower-bound for terrestrial CDR
in the AFOLU sector (including all mitigation-policy-related factors that
lead to net negative AFOLU CO, emissions).

unproven to date and raise substantial concerns about adverse side-
effects on environmental and social sustainability (Smith et al. 2015;
Dooley and Kartha, 2018).A set of key questions emerge: how strongly
do 1.5°C-consistent pathways rely on CDR deployment and what types
of CDR measures are deployed at which scale? How does this vary
across available 1.5°C-consistent pathways and on which factors does
it depend? How does CDR deployment compare between 1.5°C- and
2°C-consistent pathways and how does it compare with the findings
at the time of the AR5? How does CDR deployment in 1.5°C-consistent
pathways relate to questions about availability, policy implementation
and sustainable development implications that have been raised
about CDR technologies? The first three questions are assessed in this
section with the goal to provide an overview and assessment of CDR
deployment in the 1.5°C pathway literature. The fourth question is only
touched upon here and is addressed in greater depth in Chapter 4,
Section 4.3.7, which assesses the rapidly growing literature on costs,
potentials, availability and sustainability implications of individual
CDR measures (Minx et al., 2017, 2018; Fuss et al. 2018; Nemet
et al, 2018). In addition, Section 2.3.5 assesses the relationship
between delayed mitigation action and increased CDR reliance. CDR
deployment is intricately linked to the land-use transformation in
1.5°C-consistent pathways. This transformation is assessed in Section
2.4.4. Bioenergy and BECCS impacts on sustainable land management
are further assessed in Chapter 3, Section 3.6.2 and Cross-Chapter Box
7 in Chapter 3. Ultimately, a comprehensive assessment of the land
implication of land-based CDR measures will be provided in the IPCC
AR6 Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL).

carbon neutrality and maintain it afterwards in order to stabilize global

drawing down anthropogenic CO, in the atmosphere in order to decline
global mean temperature after an overshoot peak (Kriegler et al., 2018b;

It does not include CCS combined with fossil fuels (which is not a CDR technology as it does not result in active removal of CO, from the atmosphere). AFOLU CDR has not been
reported directly and is hence represented by means of a proxy: the additional amount of net negative CO, emissions in the AFOLU sector compared to a baseline scenario (see

pathways use neither BECCS nor afforestation but still rely on CDR
through considerable net negative CO, emissions in the AFOLU sector
around mid-century (Holz et al, 2018b). We conclude that the role of
BECCS as a dominant CDR measure in deep mitigation pathways has
been reduced since the time of the ARS. This is related to three factors:
a larger variation of underlying assumptions about socio-economic
drivers (Riahi et al, 2017; Rogelj et al, 2018) and associated energy
(Grubler et al., 2018) and food demand (van Vuuren et al., 2018);

of deployment limits for (specific) CDR measures (Holz et al, 2018b;

in 2030, 2050, and 2100, respectively. In contrast to BECCS, AFOLU
CDR is more strongly deployed in non-overshoot than overshoot
pathways. This indicates differences in the timing of the two CDR
approaches. Afforestation is scaled up until around mid-century, when
the time of carbon neutrality is reached in 1.5°C-consistent pathways,
while BECCS is projected to be used predominantly in the 2nd half
of the century (Figure 2.5). This reflects the fact that afforestation is
a readily available CDR technology, while BECCS is more costly and
much less mature a technology. As a result, the two options contribute
differently to compensating concurrent CO, emissions (until 2050)
and to producing net negative CO, emissions (post-2050). BECCS
deployment is particularly strong in pathways with high overshoots
but can also feature in pathways with low overshoot (see Figure 2.5
and 2.10). Annual deployment levels until mid-century are not found
to be significantly different between 2°C-consistent pathways and
1.5°C-consistent pathways with no or low overshoot. This suggests
similar implementation challenges for ramping up BECCS deployment
at the rates projected in the pathways (Honegger and Reiner, 2018;
Nemet et al., 2018). The feasibility and sustainability of upscaling CDR
at these rates is assessed in Chapter 4.3.7.

simultaneously in 1.5°C pathways due to the tight remaining carbon

for high CDR availability (Strefler et al, 2018b), contradicting a wait-

"Bioenergy can be used in various parts of the energy sector of IAMs, including for electricity, liquid fuel, biogas, and hydrogen production.
It is this flexibility that makes bioenergy and bioenergy technologies valuable for the decarbonization of energy use (Klein et al., 2014;
Krey et al., 2014a; Rose et al., 2014a; Bauer et al., 2017, 2018). Most bioenergy technologies in IAMs are also available in combination
with CCS (BECCS). Assumed capture rates differ between technologies, for example, about 90% for electricity and hydrogen production
and about 40-50% for liquid fuel production. Decisions about bioenergy deployment in IAMs are based on economic considerations to
stay within a carbon budget that is consistent with a long-term climate goal. IAMs consider both the value of bioenergy in the energy
system and the value of BECCS in removing CO, from the atmosphere. Typically, if bioenergy is strongly limited, BECCS technologies
with high capture rates are favoured. If bioenergy is plentiful IAMs tend to choose biofuel technologies with lower capture rates but
high value for replacing fossil fuels in transport (Kriegler et al., 2013a; Bauer et al., 2018). Most bioenergy use in |AMs is combined with
CCS if available (Rose et al., 2014a). If CCS is unavailable, bioenergy use remains largely unchanged or even increases due to the high
value of bioenergy for the energy transformation (Bauer et al., 2018). As land impacts are tied to bioenergy use, the exclusion of BECCS
from the mitigation portfolio will not automatically remove the trade-offs with food, water and other sustainability objectives due to
the continued and potentially increased use of bioenergy.

"IAMs assume bioenergy to be supplied mostly from second generation biomass feedstocks such as dedicated cellulosic crops (for
example Miscanthus or poplar) as well as agricultural and forest residues. Detailed process IAMs include land-use models that capture
competition for land for different uses (food, feed, fiber, bioenergy, carbon storage, biodiversity protection) under a range of dynamic
factors including socio-economic drivers, productivity increases in crop and livestock systems, food demand, and land, environmental,
biodiversity, and carbon policies. Assumptions about these factors can vary widely between different scenarios (Calvin et al, 2014;
Popp et al., 2017; van Vuuren et al., 2018). IAMs capture a number of potential environmental impacts from bioenergy production, in
particular indirect land-use change emissions from land conversion and nitrogen and water use for bioenergy production (Kraxner et al.,
2013; Bodirsky et al., 2014; Bonsch et al, 2014; Obersteiner et al., 2016; Humpendder et al., 2018). The impact of bioenergy production
on soil degradation is an area of active IAM development and was not comprehensively accounted for in the mitigation pathways
assessed in this report (but is, for example, in Frank et al., 2017). Whether bioenergy has large adverse impacts on environmental and
societal goals depends in large parts on the governance of land use (Haberl et al., 2013; Erb et al., 2016b; Obersteiner et al., 2016;
Humpenéder et al., 2018). Here IAMs often make idealized assumptions about effective land management, such as full protection of
the land carbon stock by conservation measures and a global carbon price, respectively, but variations on these assumptions have also
been explored (Calvin et al., 2014; Popp et al., 2014a).

alleviating land competition, respectively. They also include regulatory
policies for deepening early action and ensuring environmental

these land-use patterns are heavily influenced by assumptions about,
among other things, future population levels, crop yields, livestock
production systems, and food and livestock demand, which all vary
between the pathways (Popp et al., 2017) (Section 2.3.1.1). In pathways
that allow for large-scale afforestation in addition to BECCS, land
demand for afforestation can be larger than for BECCS (Humpendder
et al., 2014). This follows from the assumption in the modelled
pathways that, unlike bioenergy crops, forests are not harvested to

"allow unabated carbon storage on the same patch of land. If wood
harvest and subsequent processing or burial are taken into account,
this finding can change. There are also synergies between the various
uses of land, which are not reflected in the depicted pathways. Trees
can grow on agricultural land (Zomer et al, 2016), and harvested
wood can be used with BECCS and pyrolysis systems (Werner et al.,
2018). The pathways show a very substantial land demand for the two
CDR measures combined, up to the magnitude of the current global
cropland area. This is achieved in IAMs in particular by a conversion of
pasture land freed by intensification of livestock production systems,
pasture intensification and/or demand changes (Weindl et al., 2017),
and to a more limited extent, cropland for food production, as well
as expansion into natural land. However, pursuing such large-scale
changes in land use would pose significant food supply, environmental
and governance challenges, concerning both land management and
tenure (Unruh, 2011; Erb et al., 2012, 2016b; Haberl et al, 2013;
Haberl, 2015; Buck, 2016), particularly if synergies between land
uses, the relevance of dietary changes for reducing land demand, and
co-benefits with other sustainable development objectives are not

"An important consideration for CDR which moves carbon from the
atmosphere to the geological, oceanic or terrestrial carbon pools is the
permanence of carbon stored in these different pools (Matthews and
Caldeira, 2008; NRC, 2015; Fuss et al., 2016; Jones et al., 2016) (see
also Chapter 4, Section 4.3.7 for a discussion). Terrestrial carbon can
be returned to the atmosphere on decadal time scales by a variety of
mechanisms, such as soil degradation, forest pest outbreaks and forest
fires, and therefore requires careful consideration of policy frameworks
to manage carbon storage, for example, in forests (Gren and Aklilu,
2016). There are similar concerns about outgassing of CO, from ocean
storage (Herzog et al., 2003), unless it is transformed to a substance
that does not easily exchange with the atmosphere, for example, ocean
alkalinity or buried marine biomass (Rau, 2011). Understanding of the
assessment and management of the potential risk of CO, release from
geological storage of CO, has improved since the IPCC Special Report
on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage (IPCC, 2005) with experience
and the development of management practices in geological storage
projects, including risk management to prevent sustentative leakage
(Pawar et al., 2015). Estimates of leakage risk have been updated to
include scenarios of unregulated drilling and limited wellbore integrity
(Choi et al., 2013) and find that about 70% of stored CO, would still
be retained after 10,000 years in these circumstances (Alcalde et al.,
2018). The literature on the potential environmental impacts from the
leakage of CO, — and approaches to minimize these impacts should
a leak occur — has also grown and is reviewed by Jones et al. (2015).
To the extent that non-permanence of terrestrial and geological carbon
storage is driven by socio-economic and political factors, there are
parallels to questions of fossil-fuel reservoirs remaining in the ground
(Scott et al., 2015).

"Individual CDR measures have different characteristics and therefore
would carry different risks for their sustainable deployment at scale
(Smith et al., 2015). Terrestrial CDR measures, BECCS and enhanced
weathering of rock powder distributed on agricultural lands require
land. Those land-based measures could have substantial impacts
on environmental services and ecosystems (Cross-Chapter Box 7 in
Chapter 3) (Smith and Torn, 2013; Boysen et al., 2016; Heck et al., 2016;
Krause et al., 2017). Measures like afforestation and bioenergy with
and without CCS that directly compete with other land uses could have
significant impacts on agricultural and food systems (Creutzig et al.,
2012, 2015; Calvin et al., 2014; Popp et al., 2014b, 2017; Kreidenweis
et al, 2016; Boysen et al., 2017a; Frank et al., 2017; Stevanovic et al.,
2017; Strapasson et al., 2017; Humpendder et al., 2018). BECCS using
dedicated bioenergy crops could substantially increase agricultural
water demand (Bonsch et al., 2014; Séférian et al., 2018) and nitrogen
fertilizer use (Bodirsky et al, 2014). DACCS and BECCS rely on CCS and
would require safe storage space in geological formations, including
management of leakage risks (Pawar et al. 2015) and induced
seismicity (Nicol et al., 2013). Some approaches like DACCS have high
energy demand (Socolow et al. 2011). Most of the CDR measures
currently discussed could have significant impacts on either land,
energy, water, or nutrients if deployed at scale (Smith et al, 2015).
However, actual trade-offs depend on a multitude factors (Haberl et
al., 2011; Erb et al, 2012; Humpendder et al., 2018), including the
modalities of CDR deployment (e.g., on marginal vs. productive land)
(Bauer et al., 2018), socio-economic developments (Popp et al., 2017),
dietary choices (Stehfest et al., 2009; Popp et al., 2010; van Sluisveld et

livestock productivity and other advances in agricultural technology
(Havlik et al., 2013; Valin et al., 2013; Havlik et al., 2014; Weindl et al.,

(conditional) NDCs are assessed to result in global Kyoto-GHG
emissions on the order of 52-58 (50-54) GtCO2e yr—1 in 2030 (eg.,
den Elzen et al., 2016; Fujimori et al., 2016; UNFCCC, 2016; Rogelj et
al., 2017; Rose et al. 2017b; Benveniste et al, 2018; Vrontisi et al.,
2018; see Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4 for detailed assessment).
In contrast, 1.5°C pathways with limited overshoot available to this
assessment show an interquartile range of about 26-31 (median 28)
GtC0,e yr in 2030° (Table 2.4, Section 2.3.3). Based on these ranges,
this report assesses the emissions gap for a two-in-three chance of
limiting warming to 1.5°C to be 26 (19-29) and 28 (22-33) GtCO,e
(median and interquartile ranges) for conditional and unconditional
NDCs, respectively (Cross-Chapter Box 11, applying GWP-100 values
from the IPCC Second Assessment Report).

"Less CO, emission reductions in the near term would require steeper
and deeper reductions in the longer term in order to meet specific
warming targets afterwards (Riahi et al., 2015; Luderer et al., 2016a).
This is a direct consequence of the quasi-linear relationship between
the total cumulative amount of CO, emitted into the atmosphere and
global mean temperature rise (Matthews et al, 2009; Zickfeld et al.,
2009; Collins et al, 2013; Knutti and Rogelj, 2015). Besides this clear
geophysical trade-off over time, delaying GHG emissions reductions
over the coming years also leads to economic and institutional lock-in
into carbon-intensive infrastructure, that is, the continued investment
in and use of carbon-intensive technologies that are difficult or costly
to phase-out once deployed (Unruh and Carrillo-Hermosilla, 2006;
Jakob et al., 2014; Erickson et al., 2015; Steckel et al., 2015; Seto et al.,
2016; Michaelowa et al., 2018). Studies show that to meet stringent
climate targets despite near-term delays in emissions reductions,
models prematurely retire carbon-intensive infrastructure, in particular
coal without CCS (Bertram et al., 2015a; Johnson et al., 2015). The ARS
reports that delaying mitigation action leads to substantially higher
rates of emissions reductions afterwards, a larger reliance on CDR
technologies in the long term, and higher transitional and long-term
economic impacts (Clarke et al., 2014). The literature mainly focuses
on delayed action until 2030 in the context of meeting a 2°C goal
(den Elzen et al, 2010; van Vuuren and Riahi, 2011; Kriegler et al.,
2013b; Luderer et al., 2013, 2016a; Rogelj et al., 2013b; Riahi et al.,
2015; OECD/IEA and IRENA, 2017). However, because of the smaller
carbon budget consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C and the
absence of a clearly declining long-term trend in global emissions
to date, these general insights apply equally, or even more so, to the
more stringent mitigation context of 1.5°C-consistent pathways. This

"It is unclear whether following NDCs until 2030 would still allow
global mean temperature to return to 1.5°C by 2100 after a temporary
overshoot, due to the uncertainty associated with the Earth system
response to net negative emissions after a peak (Section 2.2). Available
IAM studies are working with reduced-form carbon cycle—climate
models like MAGICC, which assume a largely symmetric Earth-
system response to positive and net negative CO, emissions. The IAM
findings on returning warming to 1.5°C from NDCs after a temporary
temperature overshoot are hence all conditional on this assumption.
Two types of pathways with 1.5°C-consistent action starting in 2030
have been considered in the literature (Luderer et al., 2018) (Figure
2.13): pathways aiming to obtain the same end-of-century carbon
budget as 1.5°C-consistent pathways starting in 2020 despite higher
emissions until 2030, and pathways assuming the same mitigation
stringency after 2030 as in 1.5°C-consistent pathways starting in

"found in least-cost pathways starting from 2020). An IAM comparison
study found increasing challenges to implementing pathways with the
same end-of-century carbon budgets after following NDCs until 2030
(Luderer et al, 2018). The majority of model experiments (four out of
seven) failed to produce NDC pathways that would return cumulative
CO, emissions over the 2016-2100 period to 200 GtCO,, indicating
limitations to the availability and timing of CDR. The few such
pathways that were identified show highly disruptive features in 2030
(including abrupt transitions from moderate to very large emissions
reduction and low carbon energy deployment rates) indicating a high
risk that the required post-2030 transformations are too steep and
abrupt to be achieved by the mitigation measures in the models (high
confidence). NDC pathways aiming for a cumulative 2016-2100 CO,
emissions budget of 800 GtCO, were more readily obtained (Luderer et
al., 2018), and some were classified as 1.5°C-high-OS pathways in this
assessment (Section 2.1).

"NDC pathways that apply a post-2030 price of emissions as found in
least-cost pathways starting from 2020 show infrastructural carbon
lock-in as a result of following NDCs instead of least-cost action until
2030. A key finding is that carbon lock-ins persist long after 2030, with
the majority of additional CO, emissions occurring during the 2030-
2050 period. Luderer et al. (2018) find 90 (80-120) GtCO, additional
emissions until 2030, growing to 240 (190-260) GtCO, by 2050 and
290 (200-200) GtCO, by 2100. As a result, peak warming is about 0.2°C
higher and not all of the modelled pathways return warming to 1.5°C
by the end of the century. There is a four sided trade-off between (i)
near-term ambition, (ii) degree of overshoot, (iii) transitional challenges
during the 2030-2050 period, and (iv) the amount of CDR deployment
required during the century (Figure 2.13) (Holz et al., 2018b; Strefler
et al, 2018b). Transition challenges, overshoot, and CDR requirements
can be significantly reduced if global emissions peak before 2030
"	Text
"and fall below levels in line with current NDCs by 2030. For example,
Strefler et al. (2018b) find that CDR deployment levels in the second
half of the century can be halved in 1.5°C-consistent pathways with
similar CO, emissions reductions rates during the 2030-2050 period
if CO, emissions by 2030 are reduced by an additional 30% compared
to NDC levels. Kriegler et al. (2018a) investigate a global rollout of
selected regulatory policies and moderate carbon pricing policies.
They show that additional reductions of about 10 GtCO,e yr can be
achieved in 2030 compared to the current NDCs. Such a 20% reduction
of year-2030 emissions compared to current NDCs would effectively
lower the disruptiveness of post-2030 action. The strengthening of
short-term policies in deep mitigation pathways has hence been
identified as a way of bridging options to keep the Paris climate goals
within reach (Bertram et al., 2015b; IEA, 2015a; Spencer et al., 2015;

Comprehensive emission

Virtually all 1.5°C-consistent pathways decline net annual CO, emissions between 2020 and 2030, reaching carbon
neutrality around mid-century. In 2030, below-1.5°C and 1.5°C-low-OS pathways show maximum net CO, emissions
of 18 and 28 GtCO, yr-', respectively. GHG emissions in these scenarios are not higher than 34 GtCO,e yr"" in 2030.

Additional reductions, on top of
reductions from both CO, and
non-CO, required for 2°C,

are mainly from CO,

Both CO, and the non-CO, GHGs and aerosols are strongly reduced by 2030 and until 2050 in 1.5°C pathways.
The greatest difference to 2°C pathways, however, lies in additional reductions of CO,, as the non-CO, mitigation
potential that is currently included in integrated pathways is mostly already fully deployed for reaching a 2°C pathway.

1.5°C pathway classes), depending on the level of energy demand reductions and mitigation in other sectors.
Some 1.5°C pathways are available that do not use BECCS, but only focus terrestrial CDR in the AFOLU sector.

assessed in this section: (i) growth in the share of energy derived

without CCS (Section 2.4.2.1), (ii) rapid decline in the carbon intensity

energy end-use (Section 2.4.2.2), and (iii) the growth in the use of CCS
applied to fossil and biomass carbon in most 1.5°C pathways (Section

"The largest differences between 1.5°C and 2°C pathways are seen in the
first half of the century (Figure 2.14), where 1.5°C pathways generally
show lower energy demand, a faster electrification of energy end-use,
and a faster decarbonization of the carbon intensity of electricity and
the residual fuel mix. There are very few pathways in the Below-1.5°C
class (Figure 2.14). Those scenarios that are available, however, show
a faster decline in the carbon intensity of electricity generation and
residual fuel mix by 2030 than most pathways that are projected to
temporarily overshoot 1.5°C and return by 2100 (or 2°C pathways).
The Below-1.5°C pathways also appear to differentiate themselves
from the other pathways as early as 2030 through reductions in final
energy demand and increases in electricity share (Figure 2.14).

"The share of primary energy provided by total fossil fuels decreases from
2020 to 2050 in all 1.5°C pathways, but trends for oil, gas and coal differ
(Table 2.6). By 2050, the share of primary energy from coal decreases
to 0-11% across 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot, with
an interquartile range of 1-7%. From 2020 to 2050 the primary energy
supplied by oil changes by —93 to —9% (interquartile range -77 to
—39%); natural gas changes by -88 to +85% (interquartile range
-62 to -13%), with varying levels of CCS. Pathways with higher use
of coal and gas tend to deploy CCS to control their carbon emissions
(see Section 2.4.2.3). As the energy transition is accelerated by several
decades in 1.5°C pathways compared to 2°C pathways, residual fossil-
fuel use (ie., fossil fuels not used for electricity generation) without
CCS is generally lower in 2050 than in 2°C pathways, while combined
hydro, solar, and wind power deployment is generally higher than in

while that from coal decreases across 1.5°C pathways (high

demand and supply options. Even though they were not necessarily
developed in the context of the 1.5°C target, they explore in greater
detail some options for deep reductions in GHG emissions. For example,
there are analyses of transitions to up to 100% renewable energy by
2050 (Creutzig et al., 2017; Jacobson et al, 2017), which describe
what is entailed for a renewable energy share largely from solar and
wind (and electrification) that is above the range of 1.5°C pathways
available in the database, although there have been challenges to the
assumptions used in high-renewable analyses (e.g., Clack et al., 2017).
There are also analyses that result in a large role for nuclear energy
in mitigation of GHGs (Hong et al., 2015; Berger et al. 2017a, b; Xiao

fossil fuels are assumed to continue to have significant lifecycle GHG

Capture and Storage (IPCC, 2005) found that that, worldwide, it is
likely that there is a technical potential of at least about 2,000 GtCO,
of storage capacity in geological formations. Furthermore, the IPCC
(2005) recognized that there could be a much larger potential for
geological storage in saline formations, but the upper limit estimates
are uncertain due to lack of information and an agreed methodology.
Since IPCC (2005), understanding has improved and there have been
detailed regional surveys of storage capacity (Vangkilde-Pedersen

improvement and standardization of methodologies (e.g., Bachu et al.
2007a, b). Dooley (2013) synthesized published literature on both the
global geological storage resource as well as the potential demand
for geologic storage in mitigation pathways, and found that the
cumulative demand for CO, storage was small compared to a practical
storage capacity estimate (as defined by Bachu et al., 2007a) of 3,900

"Since the power sector is almost decarbonized by mid-century in both
1.5°C and 2°C pathways, major differences come from CO, emission
reductions in end-use sectors. Energy-demand reductions are key
and common features in 1.5°C pathways, and they can be achieved
by efficiency improvements and various specific demand-reduction
measures. Another important feature is end-use decarbonization
including by electrification, although the potential and challenges in
each end-use sector vary significantly.

"There is uncertainty in the future deployment of CCS given the
limited pace of current deployment, the evolution of CCS technology
that would be associated with deployment, and the current lack of
incentives for large-scale implementation of CCS (Bruckner et al., 2014;
Clarke et al., 2014; Riahi et al, 2017). Given the importance of CCS in
most mitigation pathways and its current slow pace of improvement,
the large-scale deployment of CCS as an option depends on the further
development of the technology in the near term. Chapter 4 discusses
how progress on CCS might be accelerated.

"subsurface pressure build-up (Szulczewski et al., 2014) and assumptions
on practices that could manage such issues (Bachu, 2015). Kearns et
al. (2017) constructed estimates of global storage capacity of 8,000 to
55,000 GtCO, (accounting for differences in detailed regional and local
estimates), which is sufficient at a global level for this century, but
found that at a regional level, robust demand for CO, storage exceeds
their lower estimate of regional storage available for some regions.
However, storage capacity is not solely determined by the geological
setting, and Bachu (2015) describes storage engineering practices
that could further extend storage capacity estimates. In summary,
the storage capacity of all of these global estimates is larger than the
cumulative CO, stored via CCS in 1.5°C pathways over this century.

"In the following sections, the potential and challenges of CO, emission
reductions towards 1.5°C and 2°C- consistent pathways are discussed
for each end-use energy sector (industry, buildings, and transport).
For this purpose, two types of pathways are analysed and compared:
IAM (integrated assessment modelling) studies and sectoral (detailed)
studies. IAM data are extracted from the database that was compiled
for this assessment (see Supplementary Material 2.5M.1.3), and the
sectoral data are taken from a recent series of publications; ‘Energy
Technology Perspectives’ (ETP) (IEA, 2014, 2015b, 2016a, 2017a), the
IEA/IRENA report (OECD/IEA and IRENA, 2017), and the Shell Sky report
(Shell International B.V. 2018). The IAM pathways are categorized
according to their temperature rise in 2100 and the overshoot of
temperature during the century (see Table 2.1 in Section 2.1). Since

"Final energy demand is driven by demand in energy services for
mobility, residential and commercial activities (buildings), and
manufacturing. Projections of final energy demand depend heavily on
assumptions about socio-economic futures as represented by the SSPs
(Bauer et al., 2017) (see Sections 2.1, 2.3 and 2.5). The structure of this
demand drives the composition of final energy use in terms of energy
carriers (electricity, liquids, gases, solids, hydrogen etc.).

"Figure 2.19 shows the structure of global final energy demand in 2030
and 2050, indicating the trend toward electrification and fossil fuel
usage reduction. This trend is more significant in 1.5°C pathways than
2°C pathways. Electrification continues throughout the second half of
the century, leading to a 3.5- to 6-fold increase in electricity demand
(interquartile range; median 4.5) by the end of the century relative to
today (Grubler et al, 2018; Luderer et al, 2018). Since the electricity
sector is completely decarbonized by mid-century in 1.5°C pathways
(see Figure 2.20), electrification is the primary means to decarbonize
energy end-use sectors.

"Energy-demand reduction measures are key to reducing CO, emissions
from end-use sectors for low-carbon pathways. The upstream energy
reductions can be from several times to an order of magnitude larger
than the initial end-use demand reduction. There are interdependencies
among the end-use sectors and between energy-supply and end-use
sectors, which elevate the importance of a wide, systematic approach.
As shown in Figure 2.19, global final energy consumption grows by 30%
and 10% from 2010 to 2050 for 2°C-consistent and 1.5°C overshoot
pathways from IAMs, respectively, while much higher growth of 75% is
projected for reference scenarios. The ranges within a specific pathway
class are due to a variety of factors as introduced in Section 2.3.1, as
well as differences between modelling frameworks. The important
energy efficiency and conservation improvements that facilitate many
of the 1.5°C pathways raise the issue of potential rebound effects
(Saunders, 2015), which, while promoting development, can make
the achievement of low-energy demand futures more difficult than
modelling studies anticipate (see Sections 2.5 and 2.6).

"IEA ETP-B2DS (‘Beyond 2 Degrees’) and ETP-2DS are pathways with
a 50% chance of limiting temperature rise below 1.75°C and 2°C
by 2100, respectively (IEA, 2017a). The IEA-66%2DS pathway keeps
global mean temperature rise below 2°C, not just in 2100 but also
over the course of the 21st century, with a 66% chance of being below
2°C by 2100 (OECD/IEA and IRENA, 2017). The comparison of CO,
emission trajectories between ETP-B2DS and IAM-1.5DS-OS show that
these are consistent up to 2060 (Figure 2.18). IEA scenarios assume
that only a very low level of BECCS is deployed to help offset emissions
in difficult-to-decarbonize sectors, and that global energy-related CO,
emissions do not turn net negative at any time but stay at zero from
2060 to 2100 (IEA, 2017a). Therefore, although its temperature rise
in 2100 is below 1.75°C rather than below 1.5°C, this scenario can
give information related to a 1.5°C overshoot pathway up to 2050.
The trajectory of IEA-66%2DS (also referred to in other publications as
IEA’s ‘Faster Transition Scenario’) lies between IAM-1.5DS-OS and I|AM-
2DS pathway ranges, and IEA-2DS stays in the range of 2°C-consistent
IAM pathways. The Shell-Sky scenario aims to hold the temperature
rise to well below 2°C, but it is a delayed action pathway relative to
others, as can be seen in Figure 2.18.
"	Text
"The CO, emissions® of end-use sectors and carbon intensity are shown
in Figure 2.20. The projections of IAMs and IEA studies show rather
different trends, especially in the carbon intensity. These differences
come from various factors, including the deployment of CCS, the
level of fuel switching and efficiency improvements, and the effect
of structural and behavioural changes. IAM projections are generally
optimistic for the industry sectors, but not for buildings and transport
sectors. Although GDP increases by a factor of 3.4 from 2010 to 2050,
the total energy consumption of end-use sectors grows by only about
30% and 20% in 1.5°C overshoot and 2°C-consistent pathways,
respectively. However, CO, emissions would need to be reduced further
to achieve the stringent temperature limits. Figure 2.20 shows that the
reduction in CO, emissions of end-use sectors is larger and more rapid
in 1.5°C overshoot than 2°C-consistent pathways, while emissions
from the power sector are already almost zero in 2050 in both sets
of pathways, indicating that supply-side emissions reductions are
almost fully exploited already in 2°C-consistent pathways (see Figure
2.20) (Rogelj et al., 2015b, 2018; Luderer et al, 2016b). The emission
reductions in end-use sectors are largely made possible by efficiency
improvements, demand reduction measures and electrification, but
the level of emissions reductions varies across end-use sectors. While

rate of 3.4% between 2000 and 2014, significantly faster than total

the combustion of fossil fuels, non-energy uses of fossil fuels in the
petrochemical industry and metal smelting, as well as non-fossil fuel
process emissions (e.g., from cement production) contribute a small
amount (~5%) to the sector's CO, emissions inventory. Material

"As shown in Figure 2.21, a major share of the additional emission
reductions required for 1.5°C-overshoot pathways compared to
those in 2°C-consistent pathways comes from industry. Final energy,
CO, emissions, and carbon intensity are consistent in IAM and
sectoral studies, but in IAM-1.5°C-overshoot pathways the share of
electricity is higher than IEA-B2DS (40% vs. 25%) and hydrogen is
also considered to have a share of about 5% versus 0%. In 2050, final
energy is increased by 30% and 5% compared with the 2010 level
(red dotted line) for 1.5°C-overshoot and 2°C-consistent pathways,
respectively, but CO, emissions are decreased by 80% and 50%
and carbon intensity by 80% and 60%, respectively. This additional
decarbonization is brought by switching to low-carbon fuels and CCS
deployment.

such as clinker substitution in cement production (Allwood et al., 2013;
IEA, 2017a). Related to material efficiency, use of fossil-fuel feedstocks
could shift to lower-carbon feedstocks, such as from oil to natural gas

such as biomass-based materials, reducing the demand for energy-

"Reaping energy efficiency potentials hinges critically on advanced
management practices, such as energy management systems, in
industrial facilities as well as targeted policies to accelerate adoption of
the best available technology (see Section 2.5). Although excess energy,
usually as waste heat, is inevitable, recovering and reusing this waste
heat under economically and technically viable conditions benefits
the overall energy system. Furthermore, demand-side management
strategies could modulate the level of industrial activity in line with
the availability of resources in the power system. This could imply a
shift away from peak demand and as power supply decarbonizes, this
demand-shaping potential could shift some load to times with high
portions of low-carbon electricity generation (IEA, 2017a).

"Broadly speaking, the industry sector's mitigation measures can
be categorized in terms of the following five strategies: (i) reducing
demand, (ii) energy efficiency, (iii) increasing electrification of energy

(v) deploying innovative processes and application of CCS. IEA ETP
estimates the relative contribution of different measures for CO,

scenario in 2050 as follows: energy efficiency 42%, innovative process
and CCS 37%, switching to low-carbon fuels and feedstocks 13% and

"Past growth of energy consumption has been mainly driven by
population and economic growth, with improved access to electricity,
and higher use of electrical appliances and space cooling resulting
from increasing living standards, especially in developing countries
(Lucon et al., 2014). These trends will continue in the future and in
2050, energy consumption is projected to increase by 20% and 50%
compared to 2010 in the IAM-1.5°C-overshoot and 2°C-consistent
pathways, respectively (Figure 2.22). However, sectoral studies (IEA-
ETP scenarios) show different trends. Energy consumption in 2050
decreases compared to 2010 in ETP-B2DS, and the reduction rate of
CO, emissions is higher than in IAM pathways (Figure 2.22). Mitigation
options are often more widely covered in sectoral studies (Lucon et al.,
2014), leading to greater reductions in energy consumption and CO,
emissions.

"with 50% in 2°C-consistent pathways (Figure 2.22). Electrification
contributes to the reduction of direct CO, emissions by replacing
carbon-intensive fuels, like oil and coal. Furthermore, when combined
with a rapid decarbonization of the power system (see Section 2.4.1) it
also enables further reduction of indirect CO, emissions from electricity.
Sectoral bottom-up models generally estimate lower electrification
potentials for the buildings sector in comparison to global IAMs (see
Figure 2.22). Besides CO, emissions, increasing global demand for
air conditioning in buildings may also lead to increased emissions of
HFCs in this sector over the next few decades. Although these gases
are currently a relatively small proportion of annual GHG emissions,
their use in the air conditioning sector is expected to grow rapidly over
the next few decades if alternatives are not adopted. However, their
projected future impact can be significantly mitigated through better
servicing and maintenance of equipment and switching of cooling
gases (Shah et al., 2015; Purohit and Héglund-Isaksson, 2017).

of global energy-related CO, emissions in 2014. Emissions increased by
2.5% annually between 2010 and 2015, and over the past half century
the sector has witnessed faster emissions growth than any other. The
transport sector is the least diversified energy end-use sector; the

transport final energy demand consisting of oil products (IEA, 2017a),

"° In this section, we only discuss the direct emissions from the sector, but the selection of building materials has a significant impact on the reduction of energy and emissions
during production, such as shift from the steel and concrete to wood-based materials.

10 This is estimated for the biofuels produced in a “sustainable manner” from non-food crop feedstocks, which are capable of delivering significant lifecycle GHG emissions
savings compared with fossil fuel alternatives, and which do not directly compete with food and feed crops for agricultural land or cause adverse sustainability impacts.

"ETP-B2DS, energy demand for space heating and cooling is 33% lower
in 2050 than in the reference scenario, and these reductions account
for 54% of total reductions from the reference scenario. Energy savings
from shifts to high-performance lighting, appliances, and water heating
equipment account for a further 24% of the total reduction. The long-
term, strategic shift away from fossil-fuel use in buildings, alongside
the rapid uptake of energy efficient, integrated and renewable
energy technologies (with clean power generation), leads to a drastic
reduction of CO, emissions. In ETP-B2DS, the direct CO, emissions are
79% lower than the reference scenario in 2050, and the remaining
emissions come mainly from the continued use of natural gas.

sector are shown in Figure 2.23. The projections of IAMs are more
pessimistic than IEA-ETP scenarios, though both clearly project deep
cuts in energy consumption and CO, emissions by 2050. For example,
1.5°C-overshoot pathways from IAMs project a reduction of 15% in
energy consumption between 2015 and 2050, while ETP-B2DS projects
a reduction of 30% (Figure 2.23). Furthermore, IAM pathways are
generally more pessimistic in the projections of CO, emissions and
carbon intensity reductions. In ARS (Clarke et al., 2014; Sims et al.,

"The buildings sector is characterized by very long-living infrastructure,
and immediate steps are hence important to avoid lock-in of inefficient
carbon and energy-intensive buildings. This applies both to new buildings
in developing countries where substantial new construction is expected
in the near future and to retrofits of existing building stock in developed
regions. This represents both a significant risk and opportunity for
mitigation.’ A recent study highlights the benefits of deploying the most
advanced renovation technologies, which would avoid lock-in into less
efficient measures (Giineralp et al., 2017).Aside from the effect of building
envelope measures, adoption of energy-efficient technologies such as
heat pumps and, more recently, light-emitting diodes is also important
for the reduction of energy and CO, emissions (IEA, 2017a). Consumer
choices, behaviour and building operation can also significantly affect
energy consumption (see Chapter 4, Section 4.3).
"	Text
"The potential and strategies to reduce energy consumption and CO,
emissions differ significantly among transport modes. In ETP-B2DS,
e shares of energy consumption and CO, emissions in 2050 for each
mode are rather different (see Table 2.8), indicating the challenge
of decarbonizing heavy-duty vehicles (HDV, trucks), aviation, and
ipping. The reduction of CO, emissions in the whole sector from
e reference scenario to ETP-B2DS is 60% in 2050, with varying
contributions per mode (Table 2.8). Since there is no silver bullet for
is deep decarbonization, every possible measure would be required
to achieve this stringent emissions outcome. The contribution of
various measures for the CO, emission reduction from the reference
scenario to the IEA-B2DS in 2050 can be decomposed to efficiency
improvement (29%), biofuels (36%), electrification (15%), and avoid/
ift (20%) (IEA, 2017a). It is noted that the share of electrification
becomes larger compared with older studies, reflected by the recent
growth of electric vehicle sales worldwide. Another new trend is the
allocation of biofuels to each mode of transport. In IEA-B2DS, the total
amount of biofuels consumed in the transport sector is 24EJ'° in 2060,
and allocated to LDV (light-duty vehicles, 17%), HDV (35%), aviation
(28%), and shipping (21%), that is, more biofuels is allocated to the
difficult-to-decarbonize modes (see Table 2.8).

"Deep emissions reductions in the transport sector would be achieved by
several means. Technology-focused measures such as energy efficiency
and fuel-switching are two of these. Structural changes that avoid or
shift transport activity are also important. While the former solutions
(technologies) always tend to figure into deep decarbonization
pathways in a major way, this is not always the case with the latter,
especially in IAM pathways. Comparing different types of global
transport models, Yeh et al. (2016) find that sectoral (intensive) studies
generally envision greater mitigation potential from structural changes
in transport activity and modal choice. Though, even there, it is primarily
the switching of passengers and freight from less- to more-efficient
travel modes (e.g., cars, trucks and airplanes to buses and trains) that is
the main strategy; other actions, such as increasing vehicle load factors
(occupancy rates) and outright reductions in travel demand (e.g., as
a result of integrated transport, land-use and urban planning), figure
much less prominently. Whether these dynamics accurately reflect the
actual mitigation potential of structural changes in transport activity
and modal choice is a point of investigation. According to the recent
IEA-ETP scenarios, the share of avoid (reduction of mobility demand)
and shift (shifting to more efficient modes) measures in the reduction of
CO, emissions from the reference to B2DS scenarios in 2050 amounts
to 20% (IEA, 2017a).

in the transport fuel mix over the first half of the century. As seen in
Figure 2.23, the projections of energy consumption, CO, emissions and

These differences can be explained by more weight on efficiency
improvements and avoid/shift decreasing energy consumption, and
the higher share of biofuels and electricity accelerating the speed of
decarbonization in ETP scenarios. Although biofuel consumption and

"The agricultural and land system described together under the umbrella
of the AFOLU (agriculture, forestry, and other land use) sector plays
an important role in 1.5°C pathways (Clarke et al, 2014; Smith and
Bustamante, 2014; Popp et al, 2017). On the one hand, its emissions
need to be limited over the course of this century to be in line with
pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C (see Sections 2.2-3). On the other
hand, the AFOLU system is responsible for food and feed production;
for wood production for pulp and construction; for the production of
biomass that is used for energy, CDR or other uses; and for the supply of
non-provisioning (ecosystem) services (Smith and Bustamante, 2014).
Meeting all demands together requires changes in land use, as well as
in agricultural and forestry practices, for which a multitude of potential
options have been identified (Smith and Bustamante, 2014; Popp et

rates of deforestation and other land-based mitigation options (as

"Land-use changes until mid-century occur in the large majority of
SSP pathways, both under stringent mitigation and in absence of
mitigation (Figure 2.24). In the latter case, changes are mainly due
to socio-economic drivers like growing demands for food, feed and
wood products. General transition trends can be identified for many
land types in 1.5°C pathways, which differ from those in baseline
scenarios and depend on the interplay with mitigation in other
sectors (Figure 2.24) (Popp et al., 2017; Riahi et al., 2017; Rogelj et
al., 2018). Mitigation that demands land mainly occurs at the expense
of agricultural land for food and feed production. Additionally, some
biomass is projected to be grown on marginal land or supplied from
residues and waste, but at lower shares. Land for second-generation
energy crops (such as Miscanthus or poplar) expands by 2030
and 2050 in all available pathways that assume a cost-effective
achievement of a 1.5°C temperature goal in 2100 (Figure 2.24), but
the scale depends strongly on underlying socio-economic assumptions
(see later discussion of land pathway archetypes). Reducing rates of
deforestation restricts agricultural expansion, and forest cover can
expand strongly in 1.5°C and 2°C pathways alike compared to its
extent in no-climate-policy baselines due to reduced deforestation and
afforestation and reforestation measures. However, the extent to which
forest cover expands varies highly across models in the literature,
with some models projecting forest cover to stay virtually constant or
decline slightly. This is due to whether afforestation and reforestation is
included as a mitigation technology in these pathways and interactions
with other sectors.

aiming at limiting end-of-century radiative forcing to 4.5 or 2.6 W m=,

respectively (calculations based on FAOSTAT, 2018). For aggregate
energy crops, models assume 4.2-8.9 tDM ha yr~"" in 2010, increasing
to about 6.9-17.4 tDM ha"" yr"" in 2050, which fall within the range

"Changes in the AFOLU sector are driven by three main factors: demand
changes, efficiency of production, and policy assumptions (Smith et

(including dietary preferences and food waste affecting demand for
food and feed) (Smith et al., 2013; van Vuuren et al., 2018), demand for
forest products for pulp and construction (including less wood waste),
and demand for biomass for energy production (Lambin and Meyfroidt,

forestry production relates to improvements in agricultural and forestry
practices (including product cascades, by-products and more waste- and
residue-based biomass for energy production), agricultural and forestry
yield increases, and intensification of livestock production systems
leading to higher feed efficiency and changes in feed composition

agricultural land for food and feed crops by 2050 relative to 2010. The large range across the literature and the understanding of the variations across models and assumptions
leads to medium confidence in the size of these ranges.

(FAOSTAT, 2018), 4.9 billion hectares (approximately 40% of the land surface) was under agricultural use in 2005, either as cropland (1.5 billion hectares) or
pasture (3.4 billion hectares). FAO data in the table are equally from FAOSTAT (2018).

"Stringent mitigation pathways inform general GHG dynamics in
the AFOLU sector. First, CO, emissions from deforestation can be
abated at relatively low carbon prices if displacement effects in
other regions (Calvin et al, 2017) or other land-use types with high
carbon density (Calvin et al, 2014; Popp et al., 2014a; Kriegler et
al., 2017) can be avoided. However, efficiency and costs of reducing
rates of deforestation strongly depend on governance performance,
institutions and macroeconomic factors (Wang et al., 2016). Secondly,
besides CO, reductions, the land system can play an important role
for overall CDR efforts (Rogelj et al, 2018) via BECCS, afforestation
and reforestation, or a combination of options. The AFOLU sector also
provides further potential for active terrestrial carbon sequestration,
for example, via land restoration, improved management of forest and
agricultural land (Griscom et al., 2017), or biochar applications (Smith,

without land-based mitigation). Lower consumption of livestock
products by 2050 could also substantially reduce deforestation and
cumulative carbon losses (Weindl et al, 2017). On the supply side,
minor productivity growth in extensive livestock production systems
is projected to lead to substantial CO, emission abatement, but the
emission-saving potential of productivity gains in intensive systems is
limited, mainly due to trade-offs with soil carbon stocks (Weindl et al.,
2017). In addition, even within existing livestock production systems, a
transition from extensive to more productive systems bears substantial
GHG abatement potential, while improving food availability (Gerber et

agricultural intensification for reducing GHG emissions in the AFOLU

"policy assumptions), and can apply these in different configurations.
For example, among the four illustrative archetypes used in this
chapter (Section 2.1), the LED and S1 pathways focus on generally
low resource and energy consumption (including healthy diets with
low animal-calorie shares and low food waste) as well as significant
agricultural intensification in combination with high levels of nature
protection. Under such assumptions, comparably small amounts of
land are needed for land-demanding mitigation activities such as
BECCS and afforestation and reforestation, leaving the land footprint
for energy crops in 2050 virtually the same compared to 2010 levels for
the LED pathway. In contrast, future land-use developments can look
very different under the resource- and energy-intensive $5 pathway
that includes less healthy diets with high animal shares and high
shares of food waste (Tilman and Clark, 2014; Springmann et al., 2016)
combined with a strong orientation towards technology solutions to
compensate for high reliance on fossil-fuel resources and associated
high levels of GHG emissions in the baseline. In such pathways, climate
change mitigation strategies strongly depend on the availability of
CDR through BECCS (Humpendder et al., 2014). As a consequence, the
$5 pathway sources significant amounts of biomass through bioenergy
crop expansion in combination with agricultural intensification. Also,
further policy assumptions can strongly affect land-use developments,
highlighting the importance for land use of making appropriate
policy choices. For example, within the SSP set, some pathways rely
strongly on a policy to incentivize afforestation and reforestation for
CDR together with BECCS, which results in an expansion of forest area
and a corresponding increase in terrestrial carbon stock. Finally, the
variety of pathways illustrates how policy choices in the AFOLU and
other sectors strongly affect land-use developments and associated
sustainable development interactions (Chapter 5, Section 5.4) in 1.5°C
pathways.

"Residual agricultural non-CO, emissions of CH, and N,O play an
important role for temperature stabilization pathways, and their relative
importance increases in stringent mitigation pathways in which CO, is
reduced to net zero emissions globally (Gernaat et al., 2015; Popp et al.,
2017; Stevanovic et al., 2017; Rogelj et al., 2018), for example, through
their impact on the remaining carbon budget (Section 2.2). Although
agricultural non-CO, emissions show marked reduction potentials
in 2°C-consistent pathways, complete elimination of these emission
sources does not occur in IAMs based on the evolution of agricultural
practice assumed in integrated models (Figure 2.25) (Gernaat et al.,
2015). Methane emissions in 1.5°C pathways are reduced through
improved agricultural management (e.g., improved management of
water in rice production, manure and herds, and better livestock quality
through breeding and improved feeding practices) as well as dietary
shifts away from emissions-intensive livestock products. Similarly,
N,O emissions decrease due to improved N-efficiency and manure
management (Frank et al., 2018). However, high levels of bioenergy
production can also result in increased N,O emissions (Kriegler et
al., 2017), highlighting the importance of appropriate management
approaches (Davis et al, 2013). Residual agricultural emissions can be
further reduced by limiting demand for GHG-intensive foods through
shifts to healthier and more sustainable diets (Tilman and Clark, 2014;
Erb et al., 2016b; Springmann et al., 2016) and reductions in food waste
(Bajzelj et al., 2014; Muller et al, 2017; Popp et al., 2017) (see also
Chapter 4 and SRCCL). Finally, several mitigation measures that could
affect these agricultural non-CO, emissions are not, or only to a limited
degree, considered in the current integrated pathway literature (see
Supplementary Material 2.5M.1.2). Such measures (like plant-based
and synthetic proteins, methane inhibitors and vaccines in livestock,
alternate wetting and drying in paddy rice, or nitrification inhibitors)
are very diverse and differ in their development or deployment stages.
Their potentials have not been explicitly assessed here.

"Despite the limitations of current modelling approaches, there is high
agreement and robust evidence across models and studies that the

The findings from these multiple lines of evidence also result in high
confidence that AFOLU mitigation strategies can vary significantly
based on preferences and policy choices, facilitating the exploration of
strategies that can achieve multiple societal objectives simultaneously
(see also Section 2.5.3). At the same time, given the many uncertainties
and limitations, only low to medium confidence can be attributed by
this assessment to the more extreme AFOLU developments found in

"Moving from a 2°C to a 1.5°C pathway implies bold integrated policies
that enable higher socio-technical transition speeds, larger deployment
scales, and the phase-out of existing systems that may lock in
emissions for decades (high confidence) (Geels et al., 2017; Kuramochi
et al, 2017; Rockstrom et al., 2017; Vogt-Schilb and Hallegatte, 2017;
Kriegler et al, 2018a; Michaelowa et al., 2018). This requires higher
levels of transformative policy regimes in the near term, which allow
deep decarbonization pathways to emerge and a net zero carbon
energy—economy system to emerge in the 2040-2060 period (Rogelj
et al., 2015b; Bataille et al., 2016b). This enables accelerated levels
of technological deployment and innovation (Geels et al., 2017; IEA,
2017a; Grubler et al., 2018) and assumes more profound behavioural,
economic and political transformation (Sections 2.3, 2.4 and 4.4).
Despite inherent levels of uncertainty attached to modelling studies
(eg., related to climate and carbon cycle response), studies stress the
urgency for transformative policy efforts to reduce emissions in the
short term (Riahi et al., 2015; Kuramochi et al, 2017; Rogelj et al,
2018).

"The IAMs used in the pathways underlying this assessment (Popp
et al., 2017; Riahi et al., 2017; Rogelj et al., 2018) do not include all
potential land-based mitigation options and side-effects, and their
results are hence subject to uncertainty. For example, recent research
has highlighted the potential impact of forest management practices
on land carbon content (Erb et al., 2016a; Naudts et al., 2016) and
the uncertainty surrounding future crop yields (Haberl et al, 2013;
Searle and Malins, 2014) and water availability (Liu et al., 2014).
These aspects are included in IAMs in varying degrees but were not
assessed in this report. Furthermore, land-use modules of some IAMs
can depict spatially resolved climate damages to agriculture (Nelson et
al., 2014), but this option was not used in the SSP quantifications (Riahi
et al., 2017). Damages (e.g., due to ozone exposure or varying indirect
fertilization due to atmospheric N and Fe deposition (e.g., Shindell et
al., 2012; Mahowald et al., 2017) are also not included. Finally, this
assessment did not look into the literature of agricultural sector models
which could provide important additional detail and granularity to the
discussion presented here.’? This limits their ability to capture the full
mitigation potentials and benefits between scenarios. An in-depth
assessment of these aspects lies outside the scope of this Special
Report. However, their existence affects the confidence assessment of
the AFOLU transition in 1.5°C pathways.

"The available literature indicates that mitigation pathways in line
with 1.5°C pathways would require stringent and integrated policy
interventions (very high confidence). Higher policy ambition often
takes the form of stringent economy-wide emission targets (and
resulting peak-and-decline of emissions), larger coverage of NDCs to
more gases and sectors (e.g., land-use, international aviation), much
lower energy and carbon intensity rates than historically seen, carbon
prices much higher than the ones observed in real markets, increased
climate finance, global coordinated policy action, and implementation
of additional initiatives (e.g., by non-state actors) (Sections 2.3, 2.4 and
2.5.2). The diversity (beyond explicit carbon pricing) and effectiveness
of policy portfolios are of prime importance, particularly in the short-
term (Mundaca and Markandya, 2016; Kuramochi et al., 2017; OECD,
2017; Kriegler et al., 2018a; Michaelowa et al, 2018). For instance,
deep decarbonization pathways in line with a 2°C target (covering
74% of global energy-system emissions) include a mix of stringent
regulation (e.g., building codes, minimum performance standards),
carbon pricing mechanisms and R&D (research and development)
innovation policies (Bataille et al, 2016a). Explicit carbon pricing,
direct regulation and public investment to enable innovation are
critical for deep decarbonization pathways (Grubb et al. 2014).
Effective planning (including compact city measures) and integrated
regulatory frameworks are also key drivers in the IEA-ETP B2DS study
for the transport sector (IEA, 2017a). Effective urban planning can
reduce GHG emissions from urban transport between 20% and 50%
(Creutzig, 2016). Comprehensive policy frameworks would be needed
if the decarbonization of the power system is pursued while increasing

resilient investments are facilitated by a mix of coherent policies,
including fiscal and structural reforms (e.g., labour markets), public
procurement, carbon pricing, stringent standards, information schemes,
technology policies, fossil-fuel subsidy removal, climate risk disclosure,
and land-use and transport planning (OECD, 2017). Pathways in which
CDR options are restricted emphasize the strengthening of near-term
policy mixes (Luderer et al., 2013; Kriegler et al., 2018a). Together with
the decarbonization of the supply side, ambitious policies targeting
fuel switching and energy efficiency improvements on the demand

"1.5°C pathways. On the contrary, none of the IAMs contained in the
SR1.5 database could produce a 1.5°C pathway under SSP3-SPA3
assumptions. Preventing elements include, for instance, climate
policy fragmentation, limited control of land-use emissions, heavy
reliance on fossil fuels, unsustainable consumption and marked
inequalities (Rogelj et al, 2018). Dietary aspects of the SSPs are also
critical: climate-friendly diets were contained in ‘sustainability’ (SSP1)
and meat-intensive diets in SSP3 and SSP5 (Popp et al. 2017). CDR
requirements are reduced under ‘sustainability’ related assumptions
(Strefler et al., 2018b). These are major policy-related reasons for why
SSP1-SPA1 translates into relatively low mitigation challenges whereas
SSP3-SPA3 and SSP5-SPAS entail futures that pose the highest socio-
technical and economic challenges. SSPs/SPAs assumptions indicate
that policy-driven pathways that encompass accelerated change away
from fossil fuels, large-scale deployment of low-carbon energy supplies,
improved energy efficiency and sustainable consumption lifestyles
reduce the risks of climate targets becoming unreachable (Clarke et

"The combined evidence suggests that aggressive policies addressing
energy efficiency are central in keeping 1.5°C within reach and lowering
energy system and mitigation costs (high confidence) (Luderer et al.,
2013; Rogelj et al., 2013b, 2015b; Grubler et al., 2018). Demand-side
policies that increase energy efficiency or limit energy demand at a
higher rate than historically observed are critical enabling factors for
reducing mitigation costs in stringent mitigation pathways across the
board (Luderer et al., 2013; Rogelj et al, 2013b, 2015b; Clarke et al.,
2014; Bertram et al., 2015a; Bataille et al, 2016b). Ambitious sector-
specific mitigation policies in industry, transportation and residential
sectors are needed in the short run for emissions to peak in 2030
(Méjean et al., 2018). Stringent demand-side policies (e.g., tightened
efficiency standards for buildings and appliances) driving the expansion,
efficiency and provision of high-quality energy services are essential
to meet a 1.5°C mitigation target while reducing the reliance on CDR
(Grubler et al, 2018).A 1.5°C pathway for the transport sector is possible
using a mix of additional and stringent policy actions preventing (or
reducing) the need for transport, encouraging shifts towards efficient
modes of transport, and improving vehicle-fuel efficiency (Gota et al.,
2018). Stringent demand-side policies also reduce the need for CCS
(Wachsmuth and Duscha, 2018). Even in the presence of weak near
term policy frameworks, increased energy efficiency lowers mitigation
costs noticeably compared to pathways with reference energy intensity
(Bertram et al., 2015a). Common issues in the literature relate to the
rebound effect, the potential overestimation of the effectiveness
of energy efficiency policy, and policies to counteract the rebound
(Saunders, 2015; van den Bergh, 2017; Grubler et al., 2018) (Sections
2.4 and 4.4).

"Policy assumptions that lead to weak or delayed mitigation action from
what would be possible in a fully cooperative world strongly influence
the achievability of mitigation targets (high confidence) (Luderer et al.,
2013; Rogelj et al., 2013b; OECD, 2017; Holz et al., 2018a; Strefler et al.,
2018b). Such regimes also include current NDCs (Fawcett et al., 2015;
Aldy et al., 2016; Rogelj et al., 2016a, 2017; Hof et al., 2017; van Soest et
al., 2017), which have been reported to make achieving a 2°C pathway
unattainable without CDR (Strefler et al., 2018b). Not strengthening
NDCs would make it very challenging to keep 1.5°C within reach (see
Section 2.3 and Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4). One multimodel
inter-comparison study (Luderer et al., 201 6b, 2018) explored the effects
on 1.5°C pathways assuming the implementation of current NDCs
until 2030 and stringent reductions thereafter. It finds that delays in
globally coordinated actions lead to various models reaching no 1.5°C
pathways during the 21st century. Transnational emission reduction
initiatives (TERIs) outside the UNFCCC have also been assessed and
found to overlap (70-80%) with NDCs and be inadequate to bridge
the gap between NDCs and a 2°C pathway (Roelfsema et al., 2018).
Weak and fragmented short-term policy efforts use up a large share of
the long-term carbon budget before 2030-2050 (Bertram et al., 2015a;
van Vuuren et al., 2016) and increase the need for the full portfolio
of mitigation measures, including CDR (Clarke et al. 2014; Riahi
et al., 2015; Xu and Ramanathan, 2017). Furthermore, fragmented
policy scenarios also exhibit ‘carbon leakage’ via energy and capital
markets (Arroyo-Curras et al, 2015; Kriegler et al., 2015b). A lack of
integrated policy portfolios can increase the risks of trade-offs between
mitigation approaches and sustainable development objectives (see
Sections 2.5.3 and 5.4). However, more detailed analysis is needed
about realistic (less disruptive) policy trajectories until 2030 that can
strengthen near-term mitigation action and meaningfully decrease
post-2030 challenges (see Chapter 4, Section 4.4).

go beyond the role of policy (including carbon pricing) and comprise
the role of citizens, businesses, stakeholder groups or governments,
as well as the interplay of institutional and socio-political dimensions
(Michaelowa et al., 2018; Veland et al., 2018). It is argued that large
system transformations, similar to those in 1.5°C pathways, require

theory rather than an optimization or equilibrium framework as is
common in current IAMs (Grubb et al., 2014; Patt, 2017). Accumulated

"Along the optimal trajectory determined by CBA, the SCC equals the discounted value of the marginal abatement cost of a metric ton
of CO, emissions. Equating the present value of future damages and marginal abatement costs includes a number of critical value
judgements in the formulation of the social welfare function (SWF), particularly in how non-market damages and the distribution of
damages across countries and individuals and between current and future generations are valued (Kolstad et al., 2014). For example,
since climate damages accrue to a larger extent farther in the future and can persist for many years, assumptions and approaches
to determine the social discount rate (normative ‘prescriptive’ vs. positive ‘descriptive’) and social welfare function (e.g., discounted
utilitarian SWF vs. undiscounted prioritarian SWF) can heavily influence CBA outcomes and associated estimates of SCC (Kolstad et
al., 2014; Pizer et al., 2014; Adler and Treich, 2015; Adler et al., 2017; NASEM, 2017; Nordhaus, 2017; Rose et al., 2017a).

"Two approaches have been commonly used to assess alternative emissions pathways: cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and
cost-benefit analysis (CBA). CEA aims at identifying emissions pathways minimising the total mitigation costs of achieving
a given warming or GHG limit (Clarke et al., 2014). CBA has the goal to identify the optimal emissions trajectory minimising the
discounted flows of abatement expenditures and monetized climate change damages (Boardman et al., 2006; Stern, 2007). A third
concept, the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) measures the total net damages of an extra metric ton of CO, emissions due to the
associated climate change (Nordhaus, 2014; Pizer et al., 2014; Rose et al., 2017a). Negative and positive impacts are monetized,
discounted and the net value is expressed as an equivalent loss of consumption today. The SCC can be evaluated for any emissions
pathway under policy consideration (Rose, 2012; NASEM, 2016, 2017).

"In CEA, the marginal abatement cost of carbon is determined by the climate goal under consideration. It equals the shadow price
of carbon associated with the goal which in turn can be interpreted as the willingness to pay for imposing the goal as a political
constraint. Emissions prices are usually expressed in carbon (equivalent) prices using the GWP-100 metric as the exchange rate
for pricing emissions of non-CO, GHGs controlled under internationally climate agreements (like CH,, N,O and fluorinated gases,
see Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1). Since policy goals like the goals of limiting warming to 1.5°C or well below 2°C do not
directly result from a money metric trade-off between mitigation and damages, associated shadow prices can differ from the SCC in
a CBA. In CEA, value judgments are to a large extent concentrated in the choice of climate goal and related implications, while more
explicit assumptions about social values are required to perform CBA. For example, in CEA assumptions about the social discount
rate no longer affect the overall abatement levels now set by the climate goal, but the choice and timing of investments in individual
measures to reach these levels.

"The use of the SCC for policy appraisals is, however, not straightforward in an SDG context. There are suggestions that a broader
range of polluting activities than only CO, emissions, for example emissions of air pollutants, and a broader range of impacts
than only climate change, such as impacts on air quality, health and sustainable development in general (see Chapter 5 for a
detailed discussion), would need to be included in social costs (Sarofim et al., 2017; Shindell et al., 2017a). Most importantly,
a consistent valuation of the SCC in a sustainable development framework would require accounting for the SDGs in the social
welfare formulation (see Chapter 5).

"The SCC and the shadow price of carbon are not merely theoretical concepts but used in regulation (Pizer et al., 2014; Revesz et al.,
2014; Stiglitz et al., 2017). As stated by the report of the High-Level Commission on Carbon Pricing (Stiglitz et al, 2017), in the real
world there is a distinction to be made between the implementable and efficient explicit carbon prices and the implicit (notional)
carbon prices to be retained for policy appraisal and the evaluation of public investments, as is already done in some jurisdictions
such as the USA, UK and France. Since 2008, the U.S. government has used SCC estimates to assess the benefits and costs related
to CO, emissions resulting from federal policymaking (NASEM, 2017; Rose et al., 2017a).
"	Text
"An important question is how results from CEA- and CBA-type approaches can be compared and synthesized. Such synthesis needs
to be done with care, since estimates of the shadow price of carbon under the climate goal and SCC estimates from CBA might not
be directly comparable due to different tools, approaches and assumptions used to derive them. Acknowledging this caveat, the
SCC literature has identified a range of factors, assumptions and value judgements that support SCC values above $100 tCO,-"" that
are also found as net present values of the shadow price of carbon in 1.5°C pathways. These factors include accounting for tipping
points in the climate system (Lemoine and Traeger, 2014; Cai et al., 2015; Lontzek et al., 2015), a low social discount rate (Nordhaus,
2007a; Stern, 2007) and inequality aversion (Schmidt et al., 2013; Dennig et al., 2015; Adler et al., 2017).

"Although CBA-based and CEA-based assessment are both subject to large uncertainty about socio-techno-economic trends, policy
developments and climate response, the range of estimates for the SCC along an optimal trajectory determined by CBA is far wider
than for estimates of the shadow price of carbon in CEA-based approaches. In CBA, the value judgments about inter- and intra-
generational equity combined with uncertainties in the climate damage functions assumed, including their empirical basis, are
important (Pindyck, 2013; Stern, 2013; Revesz et al., 2014). In a CEA-based approach, the value judgments about the aggregate
welfare function matter less, and uncertainty about climate response and impacts can be tied into various climate targets and
related emissions budgets (Clarke et al., 2014).

"The CEA- and CBA-based carbon cost estimates are derived with a different set of tools. They are all summarised as integrated
assessment models (IAMs) but in fact are of very different nature (Weyant, 2017). Detailed process IAMs such as AIM (Fujimori,
2017), GCAM (Thomson et al., 2011; Calvin et al., 2017), IMAGE (van Vuuren et al., 2011b, 2017b), MESSAGE-GLOBIOM (Riahi

and WITCH (Bosetti et al., 2006, 2008, 2009) include a process-based representation of energy and land systems, but in most
cases lack a comprehensive representation of climate damages, and are typically used for CEA. Diagnostic analyses across CBA-
IAMs indicate important dissimilarities in modelling assembly, implementation issues and behaviour (e.g., parametric uncertainty,
damage responses, income sensitivity) that need to be recognized to better understand SCC estimates (Rose et al., 2017a).
"	Text
"CBA-IAMs such as DICE (Nordhaus and Boyer, 2000; Nordhaus, 2013, 2017), PAGE (Hope, 2006) and FUND (Tol, 1999; Anthoff and
Tol, 2009) attempt to capture the full feedback from climate response to socio-economic damages in an aggregated manner, but are
usually much more stylised than detailed process IAMs. In a nutshell, the methodological framework for estimating SCC involves
projections of population growth, economic activity and resulting emissions; computations of atmospheric composition and global
mean temperatures as a result of emissions; estimations of physical impacts of climate changes; monetization of impacts (positive
and negative) on human welfare; and the discounting of the future monetary value of impacts to year of emission (Kolstad et al.,
2014; Revesz et al., 2014; NASEM, 2017; Rose et al., 2017a). There has been a discussion in the literature to what extent CBA-
IAMs underestimate the SCC due to, for example, a limited treatment or difficulties in addressing damages to human well-being,
labour productivity, value of capital stock, ecosystem services and the risks of catastrophic climate change for future generations
(Ackerman and Stanton, 2012; Revesz et al., 2014; Moore and Diaz, 2015; Stern, 2016). However, there has been progress in ‘bottom-
up’ empirical analyses of climate damages (Hsiang et al., 2017), the insights of which could be integrated into these models (Dell et
al., 2014). Most of the models used in Chapter 2 on 1.5°C mitigation pathways are detailed process IAMs and thus deal with CEA.

cost of carbon (see Cross-Chapter Box 5 in this chapter and Chapter
3, Section 3.5.2). Under a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) modelling
framework, prices for carbon (mitigation costs) reflect the stringency of
mitigation requirements at the margin (i.e., cost of mitigating one extra
unit of emission). Explicit carbon pricing is briefly addressed here to the
extent it pertains to the scope of Chapter 2. For detailed policy issues
about carbon pricing see Section 4.4.5.

"Socio-economic conditions and policy assumptions also influence the
price of carbon (very high confidence) (Bauer et al., 2017; Guivarch and
Rogelj, 2017; Hof et al, 2017; Riahi et al., 2017; Rogelj et al, 2018).A
multimodel study (Riahi et al., 2017) estimated the average discounted
price of carbon (2010-2100, 5% discount rate) for a 2°C target to
be nearly three times higher in the SSP5 marker than in the SSP1
marker. Another multimodel study (Rogelj et al., 2018) estimated the
average discounted price of carbon (2020-2100, 5%) to be 35-65%
lower in SSP1 compared to SSP2 in 1.5°C pathways. Delayed near-
term mitigation policies and measures, including the limited extent of
international global cooperation, result in increases in total economic
mitigation costs and corresponding prices of carbon (Luderer et al.,
2013; Clarke et al, 2014). This is because stronger efforts are required
in the period after the delay to counterbalance the higher emissions
in the near term. Staged accession scenarios also produce higher
mitigation costs than immediate action mitigation scenarios under the
same stringency level of emissions (Kriegler et al., 2015b).
"	Text
"a higher degree of technology granularity and that entail more
flexibility regarding mitigation response often produce relatively lower
mitigation costs than those that show less flexibility from a technology
perspective (Bertram et al., 2015a; Kriegler et al., 2015a). Pathways
providing high estimates often have limited flexibility of substituting
fossil fuels with low-carbon technologies and the associated need
to compensate fossil-fuel emissions with CDR. The price of carbon is
also sensitive to the non-availability of BECCS (Bauer et al., 2018).
Furthermore, and due to the treatment of future price anticipation,
recursive-dynamic modelling approaches (with ‘myopic anticipation’)
exhibit higher prices in the short term but modest increases in the long
term compared to optimization modelling frameworks with ‘perfect
foresight’ that show exponential pricing trajectories (Guivarch and
Rogelj, 2017). The chosen social discount rate in CEA studies (range
of 2-8% per year in the reported data, varying over time and sectors)
can also affect the choice and timing of investments in mitigation
measures (Clarke et al, 2014; Kriegler et al. 2015b; Weyant, 2017).
However, the impacts of varying discount rates on 1.5°C (and 2°C)
mitigation strategies can only be assessed to a limited degree. The
above highlights the importance of sampling bias in pathway analysis
ensembles towards outcomes derived from models which are more
flexible, have more mitigation options and cheaper cost assumptions
and thus can provide feasible pathways in contrast to other who are
unable to do so (Tavoni and Tol, 2010; Clarke et al., 2014; Bertram et
al., 2015a; Kriegler et al, 2015a; Guivarch and Rogelj, 2017). All CEA-
based IAM studies reveal no unique path for the price of emissions

pathway are relatively higher than 1.5°C-high-OS pathway in 2030,
but the difference decreases over time, particularly between 2050 and
2070. This is because in 1.5°C-high-OS pathways there is relatively
less mitigation activity in the first half of the century, but more in
the second half. The low energy demand (LED, P1 in the Summary for
Policymakers) scenario exhibits the lowest values across the illustrative
pathway archetypes. As a whole, the global average discounted price
of emissions across 1.5°C- and 2°C pathways differs by a factor of
four across models (assuming a 5% annual discount rate, comparing to
Below-1.5°C and 1.5°C-low-OS pathways). If 1.5°C-high-OS pathways
(with peak warming 0.1-0.4°C higher than 1.5°C) or pathways with
very large land-use sinks are also considered, the differential value is
reduced to a limited degree, from a factor 4 to a factor 3. The increase
in mitigation costs between 1.5°C and 2°C pathways is based on a
direct comparison of pathway pairs from the same model and the
same study in which the 1.5°C pathway assumes a significantly smaller
carbon budget compared to the 2°C pathway (e.g., 600 GtCO, smaller
in the CD-LINKS and ADVANCE studies). This assumption is the main
driver behind the increase in the price of carbon (Luderer et al., 2018;

"is an emerging body of studies (including bottom-up approaches) that
focuses on the interaction and performance of various policy mixes (e.g.,
regulation, subsidies, standards). Assuming global implementation of
a mix of regionally existing best-practice policies (mostly regulatory
policies in the electricity, industry, buildings, transport and agricultural
sectors) and moderate carbon pricing (between 5-20 USD2010 tCO,""
in 2025 in most world regions and average prices around 25 USD2010
tCO,-"" in 2030), early action mitigation pathways are generated that
reduce global CO2 emissions by an additional 10 GtCO,e in 2030
compared to the NDCs (Kriegler et al., 2018a) (see Section 2.3.5).
Furthermore, a mix of stringent energy efficiency policies (e.g., minimum
performance standards, building codes) combined with a carbon tax
(rising from 10 USD2010 tC,"" in 2020 to 27 USD2010 tCO,"" in 2040)
is more cost-effective than a carbon tax alone (from 20 to 53 USD2010
tCO,~') to generate a 1.5°C pathway for the U.S. electric sector (Brown
and Li, 2018). Likewise, a policy mix encompassing a moderate carbon
price (7 USD2010 tCO,-' in 2015) combined with a ban on new coal-
based power plants and dedicated policies addressing renewable
electricity generation capacity and electric vehicles reduces efficiency
losses compared with an optimal carbon pricing in 2030 (Bertram et al.,
2015b). One study estimates the carbon prices in high energy-intensive
pathways to be 25-50% higher than in low energy-intensive pathways
that assume ambitious regulatory instruments, economic incentives
(in addition to a carbon price) and voluntary initiatives (Méjean et
al, 2018). A bottom-up approach shows that stringent minimum
performance standards (MEPS) for appliances (e.g., refrigerators) can
effectively complement explicit carbon pricing, as tightened MEPS can
achieve ambitious efficiency improvements that cannot be assured by
carbon prices of 100 USD2010 tCO,-' or higher (Sonnenschein et al.,
2018). In addition, the revenue recycling effect of carbon pricing can
reduce mitigation costs by displacing distortionary taxes (Baranzini et
al., 2017; OECD, 2017; McFarland et al., 2018; Sands, 2018; Siegmeier
et al., 2018), and the reduction of capital tax (compared to a labour
tax) can yield greater savings in welfare costs (Sands, 2018). The effect
on public budgets is particularly important in the near term; however,
it can decline in the long term as carbon neutrality is achieved (Sands,
2018). The literature indicates that explicit carbon pricing is relevant
but needs to be complemented with other policies to drive the required
changes in line with 1.5°C cost-effective pathways (low to medium
evidence, high agreement) (see Chapter 4, Section 4.4.5) (Stiglitz et al.,

"Research carried out by six global IAM teams found that 1.5°C-consistent
climate policies would require a marked upscaling of energy system
supply-side investments (resource extraction, power generation, fuel
conversion, pipelines/transmission, and energy storage) between
now and mid-century, reaching levels of between 1.6-3.8 trillion
USD2010 yr-' globally on average over the 2016-2050 timeframe

compare to those in a policy baseline scenario is uncertain: they could
be higher, much higher, or lower. Investments in the policy baselines
from these same models are 1.6-2.7 trillion USD2010 yr’. Much
hinges on the reductions in energy demand growth embodied in the
1.5°C pathways, which require investing in energy efficiency. Studies
suggest that annual supply-side investments by mid-century could be
lowered by around 10% (McCollum et al., 2018) and in some cases up
to 50% (Grubler et al., 2018) if strong policies to limit energy demand
growth are successfully implemented. However, the degree to which

are estimated by the models employed in McCollum et al. (2018) to
be around 830 billion USD2010 (range of 150 billion to 1700 billion
USD2010 across six models). This compares to total annual average
energy supply investments in 1.5°C pathways of 1460 to 3510 billion
USD2010 and total annual average energy demand investments of
640 to 910 billion USD2010 for the period 2016 to 2050. Total energy-
related investments increase by about 12% (range of 3% to 24%) in
1.5°C pathways relative to 2°C pathways. Average annual investment
in low-carbon energy technologies and energy efficiency are upscaled
by roughly a factor of six (range of factor of 4 to 10) by 2050 compared
to 2015. Specifically, annual investments in low-carbon energy are
"	Text
"projected to average 0.8-2.9 trillion USD2010 yr-' globally to 2050
in 1.5°C pathways, overtaking fossil investments globally already by
around 2025 (McCollum et al., 2018). The bulk of these investments
are projected to be for clean electricity generation, particularly solar
and wind power (0.09-1.0 trillion USD2010 yr"" and 0.1-0.35 trillion
USD2010 yr-', respectively) as well as nuclear power (0.1-0.25 trillion
USD2010 yr-'). Third, the precise apportioning of these investments
depends on model assumptions and societal preferences related to
mitigation strategies and policy choices (see Sections 2.1 and 2.3).
Investments for electricity transmission and distribution and storage
are also scaled up in 1.5°C pathways (0.3-1.3 trillion USD2010 yr-'),
given their widespread electrification of the end-use sectors (see
Section 2.4). Meanwhile, 1.5°C pathways see a reduction in annual
investments for fossil-fuel extraction and unabated fossil electricity
generation (to 0.3-0.85 trillion USD2010 yr-' on average over the
2016-2050 period). Investments in unabated coal are halted by 2030
in most 1.5°C projections, while the literature is less conclusive for
investments in unabated gas (McCollum et al., 2018). This illustrates
how mitigation strategies vary between models, but in the real world
should be considered in terms of their societal desirability (see Section
2.5.3). Furthermore, some fossil investments made over the next few
years — or those made in the last few — will /ikely need to be retired prior
to fully recovering their capital investment or before the end of their
operational lifetime (Bertram et al., 2015a; Johnson et al., 2015; OECD/
IEA and IRENA, 2017). How the pace of the energy transition will be
affected by such dynamics, namely with respect to politics and society,
is not well captured by global IAMs at present. Modelling studies
have, however, shown how the reliability of institutions influences
investment risks and hence climate mitigation investment decisions
(lyer et al. 2015), finding that a lack of regulatory credibility or policy
commitment fails to stimulate low-carbon investments (Bosetti and
Victor, 2011; Faehn and Isaksen, 2016).

Understanding these mitigation-SDG interactions is key for selecting
mitigation options that maximize synergies and minimize trade-offs
towards the 1.5°C and sustainable development objectives (van Vuuren

pathways, having a greater relative uncertainty than in higher CO,
emission pathways. Their global emissions, their sectoral and regional
disaggregation, and their climate response are generally less well
quantified than for CO, (Sections 2.2 and 2.3). Emissions from the
agricultural sector, including land-use based mitigation options, in
1.5°C pathways constitute the main source of uncertainty here and
are an important gap in understanding the potential achievement of
stringent mitigation scenarios (Sections 2.3 and 2.4). This also includes
uncertainties surrounding the mitigation potential of the long-lived

"Figure 2.28 shows how the scale and combination of individual
mitigation measures (ie, their mitigation portfolios) influence the
extent of synergies and trade-offs with other societal objectives. All
pathways generate multiple synergies with sustainable development
dimensions and can advance several other SDGs simultaneously. Some,
however, show higher risks for trade-offs. An example is increased
biomass production and its potential to increase pressure on land and
water resources, food production, and biodiversity and to reduce air
quality when combusted inefficiently. At the same time, mitigation
actions in energy-demand sectors and behavioural response options
with appropriate management of rebound effects can advance multiple
SDGs simultaneously, more so than energy supply-side mitigation
actions (see Chapter 5, Section 5.4, Table 5.1 and Figure 5.3 for more
examples). Of the four pathway archetypes used in this chapter (LED,
S1, S2, and $5, referred to as P1, P2, P3, and P4 in the Summary for
Policymakers), the $1 and LED pathways show the largest number of
synergies and least number of potential trade-offs, while for the $5
pathway more potential trade-offs are identified. In general, pathways
with emphasis on demand reductions and policies that incentivize
behavioural change, sustainable consumption patterns, healthy diets
and relatively low use of CDR (or only afforestation) show relatively
more synergies with individual SDGs than other pathways.
"	Text
"There is robust evidence and high agreement in the pathway literature
that multiple strategies can be considered to limit warming to 1.5°C (see
Sections 2.1.3, 2.3 and 2.4). Together with the extensive evidence on
the existence of interactions of mitigation measures with other societal
objectives (Chapter 5, Section 5.4), this results in high confidence that
the choice of mitigation portfolio or strategy can markedly affect the
achievement of other societal objectives. For instance, action on SLCFs
has been suggested to facilitate the achievement of SDGs (Shindell et
al., 2017b) and to reduce regional impacts, for example, from black
carbon sources on snow and ice loss in the Arctic and alpine regions
(Painter et al., 2013), with particular focus on the warming sub-set of
SLCFs. Reductions in both surface aerosols and ozone through methane
reductions provide health and ecosystem co-benefits (Jacobson, 2002,
2010; Anenberg et al., 2012; Shindell et al., 2012; Stohl et al., 2015;
Collins et al., 2018). Public health benefits of stringent mitigation
pathways in line with 1.5°C pathways can be sizeable. For instance,
a study examining a more rapid reduction of fossil-fuel usage to
achieve 1.5°C relative to 2°C, similar to that of other recent studies
(Grubler et al, 2018; van Vuuren et al., 2018), found that improved
air quality would lead to more than 100 million avoided premature
deaths over the 21st century (Shindell et al., 2018). These benefits are
assumed to be in addition to those occurring under 2°C pathways
(eg., Silva et al, 2016), and could in monetary terms offset either a
large portion or all of the initial mitigation costs (West et al, 2013;
Shindell et al., 2018). However, some sources of SLCFs with important
impacts for public health (e.g., traditional biomass burning) are only
mildly affected by climate policy in the available integrated pathways
and are more strongly impacted by baseline assumptions about future
societal development and preferences, and technologies instead (Rao
et al., 2016, 2017).

limited pace of current deployment, the evolution of CCS technology

be comprehensively assessed in integrated assessment approaches. No
proposed technology is close to deployment at scale, and regulatory
frameworks are not established. This limits how they can be realistically
implemented within IAMs. (Section 2.3)

"Studies indicate that a major shift in investment patterns is required
to limit global warming to 1.5°C. This assessment would benefit from
a more explicit representation and understanding of the financial
sector within the modelling approaches. Assumptions in modelling
studies imply low-to-zero transaction costs for market agents and
that regulatory oversight mechanisms and fiduciary duty need to be
highly robust to guarantee stable and credible financial markets in
the long term. This area can be subject to high uncertainty, however.
The heterogeneity of actors (e.g., banks, insurance companies, asset
managers, or credit rating agencies) and financial products also needs
to be taken into account, as does the mobilization of capital and
financial flows between countries and regions (Section 2.5).

"The pathway classification employed in this chapter employs results
from the MAGICC model with its ARS parameter sets. The alternative
representation of the relationship between emissions and effective
radiative forcing and response in the FAIR model would lead to a different
classification that would make 1.5°C targets more achievable (Section
2.2 and Supplementary Material 2.5M.1.1). Such a revision would
significantly alter the temperature outcomes for the pathways and, if
the result is found to be robust, future research and assessments would
need to adjust their classifications accordingly. Any possible high bias in
the MAGICC response may be partly or entirely offset by missing Earth
system feedbacks that are not represented in either climate emulator and
that would act to increase the temperature response (Section 2.2). For
this assessment report, any possible bias in the MAGICC setup applied
in this and earlier reports is not established enough in the literature to
change the classification approach. However, we only place medium
confidence in the classification adopted by the chapter.

"The IAMs used in this report do not account for climate impacts
(Section 2.1), and similarly, none of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
projections in the mitigation pathway literature assessed in this chapter
included the feedback of climate damages on economic growth (Section
2.3). Although some IAMs do allow for climate impact feedbacks in
their modelling frameworks, particularly in their land components,
such feedbacks were by design excluded in pathways developed in the
context of the SSP framework. The SSP framework aims at providing
an integrative framework for the assessment of climate change
adaptation and mitigation. IAMs are typically developed to inform
the mitigation component of this question, while the assessment of
impacts is carried out by specialized impact models. However, the use
of a consistent set of socio-economic drivers embodied by the SSPs
allows for an integrated assessment of climate change impacts and
mitigation challenges at a later stage. Further integration of these
two strands of research will allow a better understanding of climate
impacts on mitigation studies.

Special Report identifies two main conceptual pathways to illustrate different interpretations. One stabilizes
global temperature at, or just below, 1.5°C. Another sees global temperature temporarily exceed 1.5°C before
coming back down. Countries’ pledges to reduce their emissions are currently not in line with limiting global
warming to 1.5°C.
"	Text
"This IPCC special report identifies two main pathways that explore global warming of 1.5°C. The first involves
global temperature stabilizing at or below before 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The second pathway sees
warming exceed 1.5°C around mid-century, remain above 1.5°C for a maximum duration of a few decades, and
return to below 1.5°C before 2100. The latter is often referred to as an ‘overshoot’ pathway. Any alternative
situation in which global temperature continues to rise, exceeding 1.5°C permanently until the end of the 21st
century, is not considered to be a 1.5°C pathway.
"	Text
"Countries that formally accept or ‘ratify’ the Paris Agreement submit pledges for how they intend to address
climate change. Unique to each country, these pledges are known as Nationally Determined Contributions
(NDCs). Different groups of researchers around the world have analysed the combined effect of adding up all
the NDCs. Such analyses show that current pledges are not on track to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-
industrial levels. If current pledges for 2030 are achieved but no more, researchers find very few (if any) ways to
reduce emissions after 2030 sufficiently quickly to limit warming to 1.5°C. This, in turn, suggests that with the
national pledges as they stand, warming would exceed 1.5°C, at least for a period of time, and practices and
technologies that remove CO, from the atmosphere at a global scale would be required to return warming to
1.5°C at a later date.
"	Text
"The two types of pathway have different implications for greenhouse gas emissions, as well as for climate change
impacts and for achieving sustainable development. For example, the larger and longer an ‘overshoot’, the
greater the reliance on practices or technologies that remove CO, from the atmosphere, on top of reducing
the sources of emissions (mitigation). Such ideas for CO, removal have not been proven to work at scale and,
therefore, run the risk of being less practical, effective or economical than assumed. There is also the risk that
the use of CO, removal techniques ends up competing for land and water, and if these trade-offs are not
appropriately managed, they can adversely affect sustainable development. Additionally, a larger and longer
overshoot increases the risk for irreversible climate impacts, such as the onset of the collapse of polar ice shelves
and accelerated sea level rise.

"FAQ 2.2 | What do Energy Supply and Demand have to do with Limiting Warming
to 1.5°C?
"	Title
"Warming will not be limited to 1.5°C or 2°C unless transformations in a number of areas achieve the required
greenhouse gas emissions reductions. Emissions would need to decline rapidly across all of society's main sectors,
including buildings, industry, transport, energy, and agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU). Actions
that can reduce emissions include, for example, phasing out coal in the energy sector, increasing the amount of

energy produced from renewable sources, electrifying transport, and reducing the ‘carbon footprint’ of the food
we consume.
"	Text
"To stabilize global temperature at any level, ‘net’ CO, emissions would need to be reduced to zero. This means the
amount of CO, entering the atmosphere must equal the amount that is removed. Achieving a balance between
CO, ‘sources’ and ‘sinks’ is often referred to as ‘net zero’ emissions or ‘carbon neutrality’. The implication of net
zero emissions is that the concentration of CO, in the atmosphere would slowly decline over time until a new
equilibrium is reached, as CO, emissions from human activity are redistributed and taken up by the oceans and
the land biosphere. This would lead to a near-constant global temperature over many centuries.
"	Text
"Summary: Limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels would require major reductions in green-
house gas emissions in all sectors. But different sectors are not independent of each other, and making changes
in one can have implications for another. For example, if we as a society use a lot of energy, then this could
mean we have less flexibility in the choice of mitigation options available to limit warming to 1.5°C. If we use
less energy, the choice of possible actions is greater — for example, we could be less reliant on technologies that
remove carbon dioxide (CO,) from the atmosphere.
"	Text
"The above are examples of ‘supply-side’ actions. Broadly speaking, these are actions that can reduce greenhouse
gas emissions through the use of low-carbon solutions. A different type of action can reduce how much energy
human society uses, while still ensuring increasing levels of development and well-being. Known as ‘demand-side’
actions, this category includes improving energy efficiency in buildings and reducing consumption of energy-
and greenhouse-gas intensive products through behavioural and lifestyle changes, for example. Demand- and
supply-side measures are not an either-or question, they work in parallel with each other. But emphasis can be

"Making changes in one sector can have consequences for another, as they are not independent of each other.
In other words, the choices that we make now as a society in one sector can either restrict or expand our
options later on. For example, a high demand for energy could mean we would need to deploy almost all known
options to reduce emissions in order to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, with
the potential for adverse side-effects. In particular, a pathway with high energy demand would increase our
reliance on practices and technologies that remove CO, from the atmosphere. As of yet, such techniques have
not been proven to work on a large scale and, depending on how they are implemented, could compete for land
and water. By leading to lower overall energy demand, effective demand-side measures could allow for greater
flexibility in how we structure our energy system. However, demand-side measures are not easy to implement
and barriers have prevented the most efficient practices being used in the past.

changes have had impacts on organisms and ecosystems, as
well as on human systems and well-being (high confidence). The
increase in global mean surface temperature (GMST), which reached
0.87°C in 2006-2015 relative to 1850-1900, has increased the
frequency and magnitude of impacts (high confidence), strengthening
evidence of how an increase in GMST of 1.5°C or more could impact
natural and human systems (1.5°C versus 2°C). {3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6,

"This chapter builds on findings of AR5 and assesses new scientific
evidence of changes in the climate system and the associated impacts
on natural and human systems, with a specific focus on the magnitude
and pattern of risks linked for global warming of 1.5°C above
temperatures in the pre-industrial period. Chapter 3 explores observed
impacts and projected risks to a range of natural and human systems,
with a focus on how risk levels change from 1.5°C to 2°C of global
warming. The chapter also revisits major categories of risk (Reasons for
Concern, RFC) based on the assessment of new knowledge that has
become available since ARS.

"Human-induced global warming has already caused multiple
observed changes in the climate system (high confidence).
Changes include increases in both land and ocean temperatures, as well
as more frequent heatwaves in most land regions (high confidence).
There is also high confidence that global warming has resulted in an
increase in the frequency and duration of marine heatwaves. Further,
there is substantial evidence that human-induced global warming has
led to an increase in the frequency, intensity and/or amount of heavy
precipitation events at the global scale (medium confidence), as well
as an increased risk of drought in the Mediterranean region (medium
confidence). {3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.3.4, Box 3.4}

"Robust' global differences in temperature means and extremes
are expected if global warming reaches 1.5°C versus 2°C above
the pre-industrial levels (high confidence). For oceans, regional
surface temperature means and extremes are projected to be higher
at 2°C compared to 1.5°C of global warming (high confidence).
Temperature means and extremes are also projected to be higher at
2°C compared to 1.5°C in most land regions, with increases being
2-3 times greater than the increase in GMST projected for some
regions (high confidence). Robust increases in temperature means and
extremes are also projected at 1.5°C compared to present-day values
(high confidence) {3.3.1, 3.3.2}. There are decreases in the occurrence
of cold extremes, but substantial increases in their temperature, in
particular in regions with snow or ice cover (high confidence) {3.3.1}.
"	Text
"There is no single ‘1.5°C warmer world’ (high confidence). In
addition to the overall increase in GMST, it is important to consider the
size and duration of potential overshoots in temperature. Furthermore,
there are questions on how the stabilization of an increase in GMST of
1.5°C can be achieved, and how policies might be able to influence the
resilience of human and natural systems, and the nature of regional
and subregional risks. Overshooting poses large risks for natural and
human systems, especially if the temperature at peak warming is
high, because some risks may be long-lasting and irreversible, such
as the loss of some ecosystems (high confidence). The rate of change
for several types of risks may also have relevance, with potentially
large risks in the case of a rapid rise to overshooting temperatures,
even if a decrease to 1.5°C can be achieved at the end of the 21st
century or later (medium confidence). If overshoot is to be minimized,
the remaining equivalent CO, budget available for emissions is very
small, which implies that large, immediate and unprecedented global
efforts to mitigate greenhouse gases are required (high confidence).

"Climate models project robust' differences in regional climate
between present-day and global warming up to 1.5°C?, and
between 1.5°C and 2°C? (high confidence), depending on the
variable and region in question (high confidence). Large, robust
and widespread differences are expected for temperature
extremes (high confidence). Regarding hot extremes, the strongest
warming is expected to occur at mid-latitudes in the warm season (with
increases of up to 3°C for 1.5°C of global warming, ie., a factor of two)
and at high latitudes in the cold season (with increases of up to 4.5°C
at 1.5°C of global warming, ie., a factor of three) (high confidence).
The strongest warming of hot extremes is projected to occur in
central and eastern North America, central and southern Europe, the
Mediterranean region (including southern Europe, northern Africa and
the Near East), western and central Asia, and southern Africa (medium
confidence). The number of exceptionally hot days are expected to
increase the most in the tropics, where interannual temperature
variability is lowest; extreme heatwaves are thus projected to emerge
earliest in these regions, and they are expected to already become
widespread there at 1.5°C global warming (high confidence). Limiting
global warming to 1.5°C instead of 2°C could result in around 420

"Larger risks are expected for many regions and systems for
global warming at 1.5°C, as compared to today, with adaptation
required now and up to 1.5°C. However, risks would be larger at 2°C of
warming and an even greater effort would be needed for adaptation to
a temperature increase of that magnitude (high confidence). {3.4, Box

"Global warming of 2°C would lead to an expansion of areas with
significant increases in runoff, as well as those affected by flood
hazard, compared to conditions at 1.5°C (medium confidence).
Global warming of 1.5°C would also lead to an expansion of the global
land area with significant increases in runoff (medium confidence) and
an increase in flood hazard in some regions (medium confidence)
compared to present-day conditions. {3.3.5}

"Limiting global warming to 1.5°C is expected to substantially
reduce the probability of extreme drought, precipitation deficits,
and risks associated with water availability (i.e., water stress) in
some regions (medium confidence). In particular, risks associated
with increases in drought frequency and magnitude are projected to be
substantially larger at 2°C than at 1.5°C in the Mediterranean region
(including southern Europe, northern Africa and the Near East) and
southern Africa (medium confidence). {3.3.3, 3.3.4, Box 3.1, Box 3.2}

"The probability of a sea-ice-free Arctic Ocean’ during summer
is substantially higher at 2°C compared to 1.5°C of global
warming (medium confidence). Model simulations suggest that
at least one sea-ice-free Arctic summer is expected every 10 years
for global warming of 2°C, with the frequency decreasing to one
sea-ice-free Arctic summer every 100 years under 1.5°C (medium
confidence). An intermediate temperature overshoot will have no long-
term consequences for Arctic sea ice coverage, and hysteresis is not
expected (high confidence). {3.3.8, 3.4.4.7}

"Exposure to multiple and compound climate-related risks is
projected to increase between 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming
with greater proportions of people both exposed and susceptible to
poverty in Africa and Asia (high confidence). For global warming from
1.5°C to 2°C, risks across energy, food, and water sectors could overlap

literature and the assessments offered in Sections 3.3 and 3.4, with
a focus on the impacts at 2°C of warming that could potentially be

"Evidence for the assessment of changes to climate at 1.5°C versus
2°C can be drawn both from observations and model projections.
Global mean surface temperature (GMST) anomalies were about
+0.87°C (+0.10°C likely range) above pre-industrial industrial (1850-
1900) values in the 2006-2015 decade, with a recent warming
of about 0.2°C (+0.10°C) per decade (Chapter 1). Human-induced
global warming reached approximately 1°C (+0.2°C likely range) in
2017 (Chapter 1). While some of the observed trends may be due
to internal climate variability, methods of detection and attribution
can be applied to assess which part of the observed changes may be
attributed to anthropogenic forcing (Bindoff et al, 2013b). Hence,
evidence from attribution studies can be used to assess changes
in the climate system that are already detectable at lower levels of
global warming and would thus continue to change with a further
0.5°C or 1°C of global warming (see Supplementary Material 3.SM.1
and Sections 3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.3.4 and 3.3.11). A recent study
identified significant changes in extremes for a 0.5°C difference in
global warming based on the historical record (Schleussner et al.,
2017). It should also be noted that attributed changes in extremes
since 1950 that were reported in the IPCC AR5 report (IPCC, 2013)
generally correspond to changes in global warming of about 0.5°C
(see 3.SM.1)

"Understanding the observed impacts and projected risks of climate
change is crucial to comprehending how the world is likely to change
under global warming of 1.5°C above temperatures in the pre-industrial
period (with reference to 2°C). Section 3.4 explores the new literature
and updates the assessment of impacts and projected risks for a large
number of natural and human systems. By also exploring adaptation
opportunities, where the literature allows, the section prepares the
reader for discussions in subsequent chapters about opportunities to
tackle both mitigation and adaptation. The section is mostly globally
focused because of limited research on regional risks and adaptation
options at 1.5°C and 2°C. For example, the risks of 1.5°C and 2°C of
warming in urban areas, as well as the risks of health outcomes under
these two warming scenarios (e.g. climate-related diseases, air quality
impacts and mental health problems), were not considered because
of a lack of projections of how these risks might change in a 1.5°C or
2°C warmer world. In addition, the complexity of many interactions
of climate change with drivers of poverty, along with a paucity of
relevant studies, meant it was not possible to detect and attribute
many dimensions of poverty and disadvantage to climate change. Even
though there is increasing documentation of climate-related impacts on
places where indigenous people live and where subsistence-oriented
communities are found, relevant projections of the risks associated
with warming of 1.5°C and 2°C are necessarily limited.

"change for natural and human systems (Supplementary Material
3.SM.1). Climate model simulations were generally used in the context
of particular ‘climate scenarios’ from previous IPCC reports (e.g.,
IPCC, 2007, 2013). This means that emissions scenarios (IPCC, 2000)
were used to drive climate models, providing different projections
for given emissions pathways. The results were consequently used in
a ‘storyline’ framework, which presents the development of climate
in the course of the 21st century and beyond for a given emissions
pathway. Results were assessed for different time slices within the
model projections such as 2016-2035 (‘near term’, which is slightly
below a global warming of 1.5°C according to most scenarios, Kirtman
et al., 2013), 2046-2065 (mid-21st century, Collins et al., 2013), and
2081-2100 (end of 21st century, Collins et al., 2013). Given that this
report focuses on climate change for a given mean global temperature
response (1.5°C or 2°C), methods of analysis had to be developed and/
or adapted from previous studies in order to provide assessments for
the specific purposes here.

"Most of the ‘1.5°C scenarios’, and some of the ‘2°C emissions
scenarios’ presented in Chapter 2 include a temperature
overshoot during the course of the 21st century. This means that
median temperature projections under these scenarios exceed
the target warming levels over the course of the century (typically
0.5°C-1°C higher than the respective target levels at most),
before warming returns to below 1.5°C or 2°C by 2100. During
the overshoot phase, impacts would therefore correspond to
higher transient temperature increases than 1.5°C or 2°C. For this
reason, impacts of transient responses at these higher warming
levels are also partly addressed in Cross-Chapter Box 8 in this
chapter (on a 1.5°C warmer world), and some analyses for
changes in extremes are also presented for higher levels of
warming in Section 3.3 (Figures 3.5, 3.6, 3.9, 3.10, 3.12 and 3.13).
Most importantly, different overshoot scenarios may have very
distinct impacts depending on (i) the peak temperature of
the overshoot, (ii) the length of the overshoot period, and (iii) the
associated rate of change in global temperature over the
time period of the overshoot. While some of these issues are
briefly addressed in Sections 3.3 and 3.6, and in the Cross-Chapter
Box 8, the definition of overshoot and related questions will need
to be more comprehensively addressed in the IPCC ARG report.

"to be more comprenensively aaaressed In the iFCC ARO report.

The levels of global warming that are the focus of this report
(1.5°C and 2°C) are measured relative to the pre-industrial period.
This definition requires an agreement on the exact reference time
period (for 0°C of warming) and the time frame over which the
global warming is assessed, typically 20 to 30 years in length. As
discussed in Chapter 1, a climate with 1.5°C global warming is
one in which temperatures averaged over a multi-decade time
scale are 1.5°C above those in the pre-industrial reference period.
Greater detail is provided in Cross-Chapter Box 8 in this chapter.
Inherent to this is the observation that the mean temperature of
a ‘1.5°C warmer world’ can be regionally and temporally much
higher (e.g., with regional annual temperature extremes involving
warming of more than 6°C; see Section 3.3 and Cross-Chapter
Box 8 in this chapter).

The interference of factors unrelated to greenhouse gases with
mitigation pathways can strongly affect regional climate. For
example, biophysical feedbacks from changes in land use and
irrigation (e.g., Hirsch et al., 2017; Thiery et al, 2017), or projected
changes in short-lived pollutants (e.g., Z. Wang et al., 2017), can
have large influences on local temperatures and climate
conditions. While these effects are not explicitly integrated into the
scenarios develoned in Chanter ?. they may affect nroiected

"The need to distinguish between (i) transient climate responses
(ie., those that ‘pass through’ 1.5°C or 2°C of global warming),
(ii) short-term stabilization responses (i.e., scenarios for the late
21st century that result in stabilization at a mean global warming
of 1.5°C or 2°C by 2100), and (iii) long-term equilibrium
stabilization responses (ie, those occurring after several
millennia once climate (temperature) equilibrium at 1.5°C or 2°C
is reached). These responses can be very different in terms of
climate variables and the inertia associated with a given climate
forcing. A striking example is sea level rise (SLR). In this case,
projected increases within the 21st century are minimally
dependent on the scenario considered, yet they stabilize at very
different levels for a long-term warming of 1.5°C versus 2°C
(Section 3.3.9).

The ‘1.5°C or 2°C emissions scenarios’ presented in Chapter
2 are targeted to hold warming below 1.5°C or 2°C with a certain
probability (generally two-thirds) over the course, or at the
end, of the 21st century. These scenarios should be seen as the
operationalization of 1.5°C or 2°C warmer worlds. However,
when these emission scenarios are used to drive climate models,
some of the resulting simulations lead to warming above these
respective thresholds (typically with a probability of one-third, see
Chapter 2 and Cross-Chapter Box 8 in this chapter). This is due
both to discrepancies between models and to internal climate
variability. For this reason, the climate outcome for any of these
scenarios, even those excluding an overshoot (see next point, C.),
include some probability of reaching a global climate warming
of more than 1.5°C or 2°C. Hence, a comprehensive assessment
of climate risks associated with '1.5°C or 2°C climate scenarios’
needs to include consideration of higher levels of warming (e.g.,
up to 2.5°C to 3°C, see Chapter 2 and Cross-Chapter Box 8 in this
chapter).

"In some cases, assessments of short-term stabilization responses
are also presented, derived using a subset of model simulations that
reach a given temperature limit by 2100, or driven by sea surface
temperature (SST) values consistent with such scenarios. This includes
new results from the ‘Half a degree additional warming, prognosis and
projected impacts’ (HAPPI) project (Section 1.5.2; Mitchell et al., 2017).
Notably, there is evidence that for some variables (e.g., temperature
and precipitation extremes), responses after short-term stabilization
(ie., approximately equivalent to the RCP2.6 scenario) are very similar
to the transient response of higher-emissions scenarios (Seneviratne et
al., 2016, 2018c; Wartenburger et al., 2017; Tebaldi and Knutti, 2018).
This is, however, less the case for mean precipitation (e.g., Pendergrass

relevant.

"Considering that the impacts observed so far are for a global warming
lower than 1.5°C (generally up to the 2006-2015 decade, ie., for a
global warming of 0.87°C or less; see above), direct information on
the impacts of a global warming of 1.5°C is not yet available. The
global distribution of observed impacts shown in ARS (Cramer et al.,
2014), however, demonstrates that methodologies now exist which
are capable of detecting impacts on systems strongly influenced by
factors (e.g., urbanization and human pressure in general) or where
climate may play only a secondary role in driving impacts. Attribution
of observed impacts to greenhouse gas forcing is more rarely
performed, but a recent study (Hansen and Stone, 2016) shows that
most of the detected temperature-related impacts that were reported
in ARS (Cramer et al., 2014) can be attributed to anthropogenic climate
change, while the signals for precipitation-induced responses are more
ambiguous.

"One simple approach for assessing possible impacts on natural and
managed systems at 1.5°C versus 2°C consists of identifying impacts of
a global 0.5°C of warming in the observational record (e.g., Schleussner
et al, 2017) assuming that the impacts would scale linearly for higher
levels of warming (although this may not be appropriate). Another
approach is to use conclusions from analyses of past climates combined
with modelling of the relationships between climate drivers and natural
systems (Box 3.3). A more complex approach relies on laboratory or
field experiments (Dove et al., 2013; Bonal et al., 2016), which provide
useful information on the causal effect of a few factors, which can be
as diverse as climate, greenhouse gases (GHG), management practices,
and biological and ecological variables, on specific natural systems that
may have unusual physical and chemical characteristics (e.g., Fabricius
et al, 2011; Allen et al, 2017). This last approach can be important
in helping to develop and calibrate impact mechanisms and models
through empirical experimentation and observation.

"Risks for natural and human systems are often assessed with
impact models where climate inputs are provided by representative
concentration pathway (RCP)-based climate projections. The number
of studies projecting impacts at 1.5°C or 2°C of global warming
has increased in recent times (see Section 3.4), even if the four RCP
scenarios used in AR5 are not strictly associated with these levels
of global warming. Several approaches have been used to extract
the required climate scenarios, as described in Section 3.2.1. As an
example, Schleussner et al. (2016b) applied a time sampling (or ESR)
approach, described in Section 3.2.1, to estimate the differential effect
of 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming on water availability and impacts
on agriculture using an ensemble of simulations under the RCP8.5
scenario. As a further example using a different approach, lizumi et al.
(2017) derived a 1.5°C scenario from simulations with a crop model
using an interpolation between the no-change (approximately 2010)
conditions and the RCP2.6 scenario (with a global warming of 1.8°C in
2100), and they derived the corresponding 2°C scenario from RCP2.6
and RCP4.5 simulations in 2100. The Inter-Sectoral Impact Model

"Seneviratne et al., 2016; Wartenburger et al., 2017). The ESR approach
focuses more on the derivation of a continuous relationship, while
the term ‘time sampling’ is more commonly used when comparing a
limited number of warming levels (e.g., 1.5°C versus 2°C). A similar
approach in the case of regional climate model (RCM) simulations
consists of sampling the RCM model output corresponding to the
time frame at which the driving general circulation model (GCM)
reaches the considered temperature level, for example, as done within
IMPACT2C (Jacob and Solman, 2017), see description in Vautard et
al. (2014). As an alternative to the ESR or time sampling approach,
pattern scaling may be used. Pattern scaling is a statistical approach
that describes relationships of specific climate responses as a function
of global temperature change. Some assessments presented in this
chapter are based on this method. The disadvantage of pattern scaling,
however, is that the relationship may not perfectly emulate the models’
responses at each location and for each global temperature level
(James et al., 2017). Expert judgement is a third methodology that can
be used to assess probable changes at 1.5°C or 2°C of global warming
by combining changes that have been attributed to the observed time
period (corresponding to warming of 1°C or less if assessed over a
shorter period) with known projected changes at 3°C or 4°C above
pre-industrial temperatures (Supplementary Material 3.$M.1). In order
to assess effects induced by a 0.5°C difference in global warming,
the historical record can be used at first approximation as a proxy,
meaning that conditions are compared for two periods that have a
0.5°C difference in GMST warming (such as 1991-2010 and 1960-
1979, e.g., Schleussner et al., 2017). This in particular also applies to
attributed changes in extremes since 1950 that were reported in the
IPCC ARS report (IPCC, 2013; see also 3.SM.1). Using observations,
however, it is not possible to account for potential non-linear changes
that could occur above 1°C of global warming or as 1.5°C of warming
is reached.

"Assessment of local impacts of climate change necessarily involves
a change in scale, such as from the global scale to that of natural
or human systems (Frieler et al, 2017; Reyer et al, 2017d; Jacob et

Material 3.SM.1) is crucial for translating perspectives on 1.5°C and
2°C of global warming to scales and impacts relevant to humans and
ecosystems. A major challenge associated with this requirement is
the correct reproduction of the variance of local to regional changes,
as well as the frequency and amplitude of extreme events (Vautard
et al, 2014). In addition, maintaining physical consistency between
downscaled variables is important but challenging (Frost et al., 2011).

"There is high confidence that the increase in global mean surface
temperature (GMST) has reached 0.87°C (+0.10°C likely range)

ARS assessed that the globally averaged temperature (combined
over land and ocean) displayed a warming of about 0.85°C [0.65°C

"In summary, in order to assess risks at 1.5°C and higher levels of
global warming, several things need to be considered. Projected
climates under 1.5°C of global warming differ depending on temporal
aspects and emission pathways. Considerations include whether global
temperature is (i) temporarily at this level (i.e., is a transient phase on its
way to higher levels of warming), (ii) arrives at 1.5°C, with or without
overshoot, after stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations, or (iii)
is at this level as part of long-term climate equilibrium (complete only
after several millennia). Assessments of impacts of 1.5°C of warming
are generally based on climate simulations for these different possible
pathways. Most existing data and analyses focus on transient impacts
(i). Fewer data are available for dedicated climate model simulations
that are able to assess pathways consistent with (ii), and very few data
are available for the assessment of changes at climate equilibrium (iii).
In some cases, inferences regarding the impacts of further warming of
0.5°C above present-day temperatures (i.e., 1.5°C of global warming)
can also be drawn from observations of similar sized changes (0.5°C)
that have occurred in the past, such as during the last 50 years.

"Another major challenge relates to the propagation of the uncertainties
at each step of the methodology, from the global forcings to the global
climate and from regional climate to impacts at the ecosystem level,
considering local disturbances and local policy effects. The risks for
natural and human systems are the result of complex combinations of
global and local drivers, which makes quantitative uncertainty analysis
difficult. Such analyses are partly done using multimodel approaches,
such as multi-climate and multi-impact models (Warszawski et al.,
2013, 2014; Frieler et al., 2017). In the case of crop projections, for
example, the majority of the uncertainty is caused by variation among
crop models rather than by downscaling outputs of the climate models
used (Asseng et al., 2013). Error propagation is an important issue
for coupled models. Dealing correctly with uncertainties in a robust
probabilistic model is particularly important when considering the
potential for relatively small changes to affect the already small signal
associated with 0.5°C of global warming (Supplementary Material
3.SM.1). The computation of an impact per unit of climatic change,
based either on models or on data, is a simple way to present the
probabilistic ecosystem response while taking into account the various
sources of uncertainties (Fronzek et al., 2011).

consistent with the attribution of observed historical global trends

global warming of 0.5°C (Schleussner et al., 2017). These comparisons
are addressed in more detail in Sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3. Attribution
studies have shown that there is high confidence that anthropogenic
forcing has had a detectable influence on trends in global warming
(virtually certain since the mid-20th century), in land warming on

confidence that anthropogenic forcing has contributed to increases
in mean precipitation at high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere
since the mid-20th century and to global-scale increases in heavy
precipitation in land regions with sufficient observations over the
same period (Bindoff et al., 2013a). Schleussner et al. (2017) showed,
through analyses of recent observed tendencies, that changes in
temperature extremes and heavy precipitation indices are detectable
in observations for the 1991-2010 period compared with those
for 1960-1979, with a global warming of approximately 0.5°C
occurring between these two periods (high confidence). The observed

"The next sections assess changes in several different types of climate-
related hazards. It should be noted that the different types of hazards
are considered in isolation but some regions are projected to be
affected by collocated and/or concomitant changes in several types
of hazards (high confidence). Two examples are sea level rise and
heavy precipitation in some regions, possibly leading together to more
flooding, and droughts and heatwaves, which can together increase
the risk of fire occurrence. Such events, also called compound events,
may substantially increase risks in some regions (e.g., AghaKouchak et
al., 2014; Van Den Hurk et al., 2015; Martius et al., 2016; Zscheischler

latitudes as well as in the tropics at both 1.5°C and 2°C of global
warming compared to pre-industrial conditions. The differences in
heavy precipitation at 2°C versus 1.5°C global warming are generally
not robust at grid-cell scale, but they display consistent increases in
most locations (Figure 3.4). However, as addressed in Section 3.3.3,
statistically significant differences are found in several large regions and
when aggregated over the global land area. We thus assess that there
is high confidence regarding global-scale differences in temperature
means and extremes at 2°C versus 1.5°C global warming, and medium
confidence regarding global-scale differences in precipitation means

"While the quality of temperature measurements obtained through
ground observational networks tends to be high compared to that of

it should be noted that some regions are undersampled. Cowtan and
Way (2014) highlighted issues regarding undersampling, which is
most problematic at the poles and over Africa, and which may lead
to biases in estimated changes in GMST (see also Supplementary
Material 3.SM.2 and Chapter 1). This undersampling also affects the
confidence of assessments regarding regional observed and projected
changes in both mean and extreme temperature. Despite this partly
limited coverage, the attribution chapter of ARS (Bindoff et al. 2013a)

on existing climate simulations using the empirical scaling relationship

prognosis and projected impacts (HAPPI) experiment (Mitchell et al.,

"(GISTEMP) dataset, Hansen et al., 2010). They found that substantial
changes due to 0.5°C of warming are apparent for indices related to
hot and cold extremes, as well as for the Warm Spell Duration Indicator
(WSD)). In particular, they identified that one-quarter of the land has
experienced an intensification of hot extremes (maximum temperature
on the hottest day of the year, TXx) by more than 1°C and a reduction in
the intensity of cold extremes by at least 2.5°C (minimum temperature
on the coldest night of the year, TNn). In addition, the same study
showed that half of the global land mass has experienced changes
in WSDI of more than six days, as well as an emergence of extremes
outside the range of natural variability (Schleussner et al, 2017).
Analyses from Schleussner et al. (2017) for temperature extremes are
provided in the Supplementary Material 3.SM, Figure 3.SM.6. It should
be noted that assessments of attributed changes in the IPCC SREX and
ARS reports were generally provided since 1950, for time frames also
approximately corresponding to a 0.5°C global warming (3.SM).

"Figure 3.7 displays maps of changes in the number of hot days
(NHD) at 1.5°C and 2°C of GMST increase. Maps of changes in the
number of frost days (FD) can be found in Supplementary Material
3.SM.2. These analyses reveal clear patterns of changes between the
two warming levels, which are consistent with analysed changes in
heatwave occurrence (e.g., Dosio et al., 2018). For the NHD, the largest
differences are found in the tropics (high confidence), owing to the
low interannual temperature variability there (Mahlstein et al, 2011),
although absolute changes in hot temperature extremes tended to
be largest at mid-latitudes (high confidence) (Figures 3.4 and 3.5).
Extreme heatwaves are thus projected to emerge earliest in the tropics
and to become widespread in these regions already at 1.5°C of global
warming (high confidence). These results are consistent with other
recent assessments. Coumou and Robinson (2013) found that 20%
of the global land area, centred in low-latitude regions, is projected
to experience highly unusual monthly temperatures during Northern
Hemisphere summers at 1.5°C of global warming, with this number
nearly doubling at 2°C of global warming.

"There are statistically significant differences in temperature means and
extremes at 1.5°C versus 2°C of global warming, both in the global
average (Schleussner et al, 2016b; Dosio et al., 2018; Kharin et al.,
2018), as well as in most land regions (high confidence) (Wartenburger
et al, 2017; Seneviratne et al, 2018c; Wehner et al., 2018b). Projected
temperatures over oceans display significant increases in means and
extremes between 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming (Figures 3.3 and

changes in temperature means and extremes at 1.5°C versus 2°C of

an example, Figure 3.5 shows regionally-based analyses for the IPCC
SREX regions (see Figure 3.2) of changes in the temperature of hot
extremes as a function of global warming (corresponding analyses
for changes in the temperature of cold extremes are provided in the
Supplementary Material 3.SM.2). As demonstrated in these analyses,
the mean response of the intensity of temperature extremes in climate
models to changes in the global mean temperature is approximately
linear and independent of the considered emissions scenario
(Seneviratne et al, 2016; Wartenburger et al., 2017). Nonetheless, in

"As mentioned in Section 3.3.1, there is an important land-sea warming
contrast, with stronger warming on land (see also Christensen et al.,
2013; Collins et al., 2013; Seneviratne et al, 2016), which implies that
regional warming on land is generally more than 1.5°C even when
mean global warming is at 1.5°C. As highlighted in Seneviratne et al.
(2016), this feature is generally stronger for temperature extremes
(Figures 3.4 and 3.5; Supplementary Material 3.SM.2 ). For differences
in regional temperature extremes at a mean global warming of 1.5°C
versus 2°C, that is, a difference of 0.5°C in global warming, this implies
differences of as much as 1°C-1.5°C in some locations, which are two
to three times larger than the differences in global mean temperature.
For hot extremes, the strongest warming is found in central and eastern
North America, central and southern Europe, the Mediterranean,
western and central Asia, and southern Africa (Figures 3.4 and 3.5)
(medium confidence). These regions are all characterized by a strong
soil-moisture-temperature coupling and projected increased dryness
(Vogel et al, 2017), which leads to a reduction in evaporative cooling
in the projections. Some of these regions also show a wide range of
responses to temperature extremes, in particular central Europe and
central North America, owing to discrepancies in the representation of
the underlying processes in current climate models (Vogel et al., 2017).
For mean temperature and cold extremes, the strongest warming is
found in the northern high-latitude regions (high confidence). This is
due to substantial ice-snow-albedo-temperature feedbacks (Figure
3.3 and Figure 3.4, middle) related to the known ‘polar amplification’
mechanism (e.g., IPCC, 2013; Masson-Delmotte et al., 2013).

Hemisphere has increased since 1951 (Hartmann et al., 2013). For
other latitudinal zones, area-averaged long-term positive or negative
trends have low confidence because of poor data quality, incomplete
data or disagreement amongst available estimates (Hartmann et al.,

based on a modelling study, that 13.8% of the world population would
be exposed to ‘severe heatwaves’ at least once every 5 years under
1.5°C of global warming, with a threefold increase (36.9%) under 2°C
of GMST warming, corresponding to a difference of about 1.7 billion
people between the two global warming levels. They also concluded
that limiting global warming to 1.5°C would result in about 420
million fewer people being frequently exposed to extreme heatwaves,
and about 65 million fewer people being exposed to ‘exceptional
heatwaves’ compared to conditions at 2°C GMST warming. However,
changes in vulnerability were not considered in their study. For this
reason, we assess that there is medium confidence in their conclusions.

changes in responses are found in all regions for most temperature

most regions, ii) ice days (ID), frost days (FD) and growing season length
(GSL) (mostly in regions where differences are zero, because, e.g., there
are no ice or frost days), iii) the minimum yearly value of the maximum
daily temperature (TXn) in very few regions. In terms of the sign of
the changes, warm extremes display an increase in intensity, frequency

a maximum temperature above the 90th percentile of Tmax (TX90p)

"Differences in heavy precipitation are generally projected to be
small between 1.5°C and 2°C GMST warming (Figure 3.4 and 3.9

display substantial increases, for instance southern Asia, but generally
in less than two-thirds of the CMIP5 models (Figure 3.4, Supplementary

that there are substantial differences in heavy precipitation in eastern
Asia at 1.5°C versus 2°C. Overall, while there is variation among
regions, the global tendency is for heavy precipitation to increase at
2°C compared with at 1.5°C (see eg., Fischer and Knutti, 2015 and
Kharin et al., 2018, as illustrated in Figure 3.10 from this chapter; see

"AR5 assessed that the global monsoon, aggregated over all monsoon
systems, is likely to strengthen, with increases in its area and intensity,
while the monsoon circulation weakens (Christensen et al., 2013). A
few publications provide more recent evaluations of projections of
changes in monsoons for high-emission scenarios (e.g., Jiang and Tian,
2013; Jones and Carvalho, 2013; Sylla et al., 2015, 2016; Supplementary
Material 3.SM.2 ). However, scenarios at 1.5°C or 2°C global warming
would involve a substantially smaller radiative forcing than those
assessed in AR5 and these more recent studies, and there appears
to be no specific assessment of changes in monsoon precipitation at
1.5°C versus 2°C of global warming in the literature. Consequently, the
current assessment is that there is low confidence regarding changes
in monsoons at these lower global warming levels, as well as regarding
differences in monsoon responses at 1.5°C versus 2°C.

"Regarding changes in heavy precipitation, Figure 3.9 displays projected
changes in the 5-day maximum precipitation (RxSday) as a function
of global temperature increase, using a similar approach as in Figure
3.5. Further analyses are available in Supplementary Material 3.SM.2.
These analyses show that projected changes in heavy precipitation are
more uncertain than those for temperature extremes. However, the
mean response of model simulations is generally robust and linear
(see also Fischer et al., 2014; Seneviratne et al., 2016). As observed for
temperature extremes, this response is also mostly independent of the
considered emissions scenario (e.g., RCP2.6 versus RCP8.5; see also
Section 3.2). This feature appears to be specific to heavy precipitation,
possibly due to a stronger coupling with temperature, as the scaling of
projections of mean precipitation changes with global warming shows
some scenario dependency (Pendergrass et al., 2015).

"Figure 3.3 in Section 3.3.1 summarizes the projected changes in mean
precipitation at 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming. Both warming
levels display robust differences in mean precipitation compared to
the pre-industrial period. Regarding differences at 2°C vs 1.5°C global
warming, some regions are projected to display changes in mean
precipitation at 2°C compared with that at 1.5°C of global warming in
the CMIP5 multimodel average, such as decreases in the Mediterranean
area, including southern Europe, the Arabian Peninsula and Egypt, or
increases in high latitudes. The results, however, are less robust across
models than for mean temperature. For instance, Déqué et al. (2017)
investigated the impact of 2°C of global warming on precipitation over
tropical Africa and found that average precipitation does not show a
significant response, owing to two phenomena: (i) the number of days
with rain decreases whereas the precipitation intensity increases, and
(ii) the rainy season occurs later during the year, with less precipitation
in early summer and more precipitation in late summer. The results
from Déqué et al. (2017) regarding insignificant differences between
1.5°C and 2°C scenarios for tropical Africa are consistent with the
results presented in Figure 3.3. For Europe, recent studies (Vautard et
al., 2014; Jacob et al., 2018; Kjellstrém et al, 2018) have shown that
2°C of global warming was associated with a robust increase in mean
precipitation over central and northern Europe in winter but only over
northern Europe in summer, and with decreases in mean precipitation
in central/southern Europe in summer. Precipitation changes reaching
20% have been projected for the 2°C scenario (Vautard et al., 2014)
and are overall more pronounced than with 1.5°C of global warming

a less robust decrease over central and northern Ethiopia (Section 3.3.3). The number of CDD and CWD are projected to increase and
decrease, respectively (Section 3.3.4). These projected changes could impact the agricultural and water sectors in the region (Cross-
Chapter Box 6 in this chapter and Section 3.4.6).
"	Text
"Weber et al. (2018) found that at regional scales, temperature increases in sub-Saharan Africa are projected to be higher than the global
mean temperature increase (at global warming of 1.5°C and at 2°C; see Section 3.3.2 for further background and analyses of climate
model projections). Even if the mean global temperature anomaly is kept below 1.5°C, regions between 15°S and 15°N are projected to
experience an increase in hot nights, as well as longer and more frequent heatwaves (e.g., Kharin et al., 2018). Increases would be even
larger if the global mean temperature were to reach 2°C of global warming, with significant changes in the occurrence and intensity of
temperature extremes in all sub-Saharan regions (Sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.2; Figures 3.4, 3.5 and 3.8).
"	Text
"Sub-Saharan Africa has experienced the dramatic consequences of climate extremes becoming more frequent and more intense over the
past decades (Paeth et al., 2010; Taylor et al., 2017). In order to join international efforts to reduce climate change, all African countries
signed the Paris Agreement. In particular, through their nationally determined contributions (NDCs), they committed to contribute to the
global effort to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with the aim to constrain global temperature increases to ‘well below 2°C’
and to pursue efforts to limit warming to '1.5°C above pre-industrial levels’. The target of limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-
industrial levels is useful for conveying the urgency of the situation. However, it focuses the climate change debate on a temperature
threshold (Section 3.3.2), while the potential impacts of these global warming levels on key sectors at local to regional scales, such as
agriculture, energy and health, remain uncertain in most regions and countries of Africa (Sections 3.3.3, 3.3.4, 3.3.5 and 3.3.6).
"	Text
"Over southern Africa, models agree on a positive sign of change for temperature, with temperature rising faster at 2°C (1.5°C-2.5°C) as
compared to 1.5°C (0.5°C—1.5°C) of global warming. Areas in the south-western region, especially in South Africa and parts of Namibia
and Botswana, are expected to experience the largest increases in temperature (Section 3.3.2; Engelbrecht et al., 2015; Mature et al.
2018). The western part of southern Africa is projected to become drier with increasing drought frequency and number of heatwaves
towards the end of the 21st century (Section 3.3.4; Engelbrecht et al. 2015; Dosio, 2017; Mate et al., 2018). At 1.5°C, a robust signal
of precipitation reduction is found over the Limpopo basin and smaller areas of the Zambezi basin in Zambia, as well as over parts of
Western Cape in South Africa, while an increase is projected over central and western South Africa, as well as in southern Namibia
(Section 3.3.4). At 2°C, the region is projected to face robust precipitation decreases of about 10-20% and increases in the number of
CDD, with longer dry spells projected over Namibia, Botswana, northern Zimbabwe and southern Zambia. Conversely, the number of
CWD is projected to decrease, with robust signals over Western Cape (Mate et al., 2018). Projected reductions in stream flow of 5-10%
in the Zambezi River basin have been associated with increased evaporation and transpiration rates resulting from a rise in temperature
(Section 3.3.5; Kling et al, 2014), with issues for hydroelectric power across the region of southern Africa.
"	Text
"West and Central Africa are projected to display particularly large increases in the number of hot days, both at 1.5°C and 2°C of global
warming (Section 3.3.2). This is due to the relatively small interannual present-day variability in this region, which implies that climate-
change signals can be detected earlier there (Section 3.3.2; Mahlstein et al, 2011). Projected changes in total precipitation exhibit
uncertainties, mainly in the Sahel (Section 3.3.3 and Figure 3.8; Diedhiou et al, 2018). In the Guinea Coast and Central Africa, only a
small change in total precipitation is projected, although most models (70%) indicate a decrease in the length of wet periods and a
slight increase in heavy rainfall. Western Sahel is projected by most models (80%) to experience the strongest drying, with a significant
increase in the maximum length of dry spells (Diedhiou et al., 2018). Above 2°C, this region could become more vulnerable to drought
and could face serious food security issues (Cross-Chapter Box 6 and Section 3.4.6 in this chapter; Salem et al, 2017; Parkes et al.,
2018). West Africa has thus been identified as a climate-change hotspot with negative impacts from climate change on crop yields and
production (Cross-Chapter Box 6 and Section 3.4.6; Sultan and Gaetani, 2016; Palazzo et al., 2017). Despite uncertainty in projections
for precipitation in West Africa, which is essential for rain-fed agriculture, robust evidence of yield loss might emerge. This yield loss
is expected to be mainly driven by increased mean temperature, while potential wetter or drier conditions — as well as elevated CO,
concentrations — could modulate this effect (Roudier et al., 2011; see also Cross-Chapter Box 6 and Section 3.4.6). Using Representative
Concentration Pathway (RCP)8.5 Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) scenarios from 25 regional climate
models (RCMs) forced with different general circulation models (GCMs), Klutse et al. (2018) noted a decrease in mean rainfall over
West Africa in models with stronger warming for this region at 1.5°C of global warming (Section 3.3.4). Mba et al. (2018) used a similar
approach and found a lack of consensus in the changes in precipitation over Central Africa (Figure 3.8 and Section 3.3.4), although there
was a tendency towards a decrease in the maximum number of consecutive wet days (CWD) and a significant increase in the maximum
number of consecutive dry days (CDD).

factors, including variations between the drought and dryness indices

display consistent drying in most assessments (e.g., Seneviratne et al.,

"Greve et al. (2018, Figure 3.12) derives the sensitivity of regional
changes in precipitation minus evapotranspiration to global
temperature changes. The simulations analysed span the full range of
available emission scenarios, and the sensitivities are derived using
a modified pattern scaling approach. The applied approach assumes
linear dependencies on global temperature changes while thoroughly
addressing associated uncertainties via resampling methods. Northern
high-latitude regions display robust responses tending towards
increased wetness, while subtropical regions display a tendency
towards drying but with a large range of responses. While the internal
variability and the scenario choice play an important role in the overall
spread of the simulations, the uncertainty stemming from the climate
model choice usually dominates, accounting for about half of the total
uncertainty in most regions (Wartenburger et al., 2017; Greve et al.,

or decreases in water availability under higher global warming levels,
is particularly uncertain in tropical and mid-latitude regions. An

"Human society has developed in tandem with the natural environment of the Mediterranean basin over several millennia, laying
the groundwork for diverse and culturally rich communities. Even if advances in technology may offer some protection from climatic
hazards, the consequences of climatic change for inhabitants of this region continue to depend on the long-term interplay between an
array of societal and environmental factors (Holmgren et al., 2016). As a result, the Mediterranean is an example of a region with high
vulnerability where various adaptation responses have emerged. Previous IPCC assessments and recent publications project regional
changes in climate under increased temperatures, including consistent climate model projections of increased precipitation deficit
amplified by strong regional warming (Section 3.3.3; Seneviratne et al., 2012; Christensen et al., 2013; Collins et al, 2013; Greve and
Seneviratne, 2015).

"The long history of resilience to climatic change is especially apparent in the eastern Mediterranean region, which has experienced a
strong negative trend in precipitation since 1960 (Mathbout et al., 2017) and an intense and prolonged drought episode between 2007
and 2010 (Kelley et al., 2015). This drought was the longest and most intense in the last 900 years (Cook et al., 2016). Some authors
(eg., Trigo et al., 2010; Kelley et al., 2015) assert that very low precipitation levels have driven a steep decline in agricultural productivity
in the Euphrates and Tigris catchment basins, and displaced hundreds of thousands of people, mainly in Syria. Impacts on the water
resources (Yazdanpanah et al., 2016) and crop performance in Iran have also been reported (Saeidi et al., 2017). Many historical periods
of turmoil have coincided with severe droughts, for example the drought which occurred at the end of the Bronze Age approximately
3200 years ago (Kaniewski et al., 2015). In this instance, a number of flourishing eastern Mediterranean civilizations collapsed, and rural
settlements re-emerged with agro-pastoral activities and limited long-distance trade. This illustrates how some vulnerable regions are
forced to pursue drastic adaptive responses, including migration and societal structure changes.

"A large part of the observed regional trends in streamflow and runoff
might have resulted from internal multi-decadal and multi-year climate
variations, especially the Pacific decadal variability (PDV), the Atlantic
Multi-Decadal Oscillation (AMO) and the El Nifio—Southern Oscillation
(ENSO), although the effect of anthropogenic greenhouse gases
and aerosols could also be important (Hidalgo et al, 2009; Gu and
Adler, 2013, 2015; Chiew et al., 2014; Luo et al., 2016; Gudmundsson
et al, 2017). Additionally, other human activities can influence the
hydrological cycle, such as land-use/land-cover change, modifications
in river morphology and water table depth, construction and
operation of hydropower plants, dikes and weirs, wetland drainage,
and agricultural practices such as water withdrawal for irrigation. All
of these activities can also have a large impact on runoff at the river
basin scale, although there is less agreement over their influence on
global mean runoff (Gerten et al., 2008; Sterling et al., 2012; Hall et al.,
2014; Betts et al., 2015; Arheimer et al., 2017). Some studies suggest
that increases in global runoff resulting from changes in land cover
or land use (predominantly deforestation) are counterbalanced by
decreases resulting from irrigation (Gerten et al, 2008; Sterling et al.,
2012). Likewise, forest and grassland fires can modify the hydrological
response at the watershed scale when the burned area is significant

runoff projected for large parts of northern Europe, the Glomma, Wisla

"Most recent studies on observed trends in the attributes of tropical
cyclones have focused on the satellite era starting in 1979 (Rienecker

heterogeneity of constantly advancing remote sensing techniques and
instrumentation during this period (e.g., Landsea, 2006; Walsh et al.,
2016). Numerous studies leading up to and after ARS have reported
a decreasing trend in the global number of tropical cyclones and/or
the globally accumulated cyclonic energy (Emanuel, 2005; Elsner et al.,
2008; Knutson et al., 2010; Holland and Bruyére, 2014; Klotzbach and
Landsea, 2015; Walsh et al., 2016). A theoretical physical basis for such
a decrease to occur under global warming was recently provided by
Kang and Elsner (2015). However, using a relatively short (20 year)
and relatively homogeneous remotely sensed record, Klotzbach (2006)
reported no significant trends in global cyclonic activity, consistent
with more recent findings of Holland and Bruyére (2014). Such
contradictions, in combination with the fact that the almost four-
decade-long period of remotely sensed observations remains relatively
short to distinguish anthropogenically induced trends from decadal
and multi-decadal variability, implies that there is only low confidence
regarding changes in global tropical cyclone numbers under global
warming over the last four decades.

forcing (3°C to 4°C of global warming) consistently indicate decreases
in the global number of tropical cyclones (Knutson et al, 2010, 2015;
Sugi and Yoshimura, 2012; Christensen et al., 2013; Yoshida et al.,
2017). A smaller number of studies based on statistical downscaling
methodologies contradict these findings, however, and indicate
increases in the global number of tropical cyclones under climate
change (Emanuel, 2017). Most studies also indicate increases in the
global number of very intense tropical cyclones under high levels of
global warming (Knutson et al., 2015; Sugi et al., 2017), consistent
with dynamic theory (Kang and Elsner, 2015), although a few studies
contradict this finding (e.g., Yoshida et al., 2017). Hence, it is assessed
that under 3°C to 4°C of warming that the global number of tropical
cyclones would decrease whilst the number of very intense cyclones
would increase (medium confidence).

"The global response of the mid-latitude atmospheric circulation to
1.5°C and 2°C of warming was investigated using the HAPPI ensemble
with a focus on the winter season (Li et al., 2018). Under 1.5°C of
global warming a weakening of storm activity over North America,
an equatorward shift of the North Pacific jet exit and an equatorward
intensification of the South Pacific jet are projected. Under an additional
0.5°C of warming a poleward shift of the North Atlantic jet exit and
an intensification on the flanks of the Southern Hemisphere storm
track are projected to become more pronounced. The weakening of
the Mediterranean storm track that is projected under low mitigation
emerges in the 2°C warmer world (Li et al, 2018). AR5 assessed that
under high greenhouse gas forcing (3°C or 4°C of global warming)
there is low confidence in projections of poleward shifts of the
Northern Hemisphere storm tracks, while there is high confidence that
there would be a small poleward shift of the Southern Hemisphere
storm tracks (Stocker et al, 2013). In the context of this report, the
assessment is that there is limited evidence and low confidence in
whether any projected signal for higher levels of warming would be
clearly manifested under 2°C of global warming.

"It is virtually certain that the temperature of the upper layers of the
ocean (0-700 m in depth) has been increasing, and that the global
mean for sea surface temperature (SST) has been changing at a rate
just behind that of GMST. The surfaces of three ocean basins has
warmed over the period 1950-2016 (by 0.11°C, 0.07°C and 0.05°C
per decade for the Indian, Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, respectively;
Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014), with the greatest changes occurring
at the highest latitudes. Isotherms (ie., lines of equal temperature) of
sea surface temperature (SST) are shifting to higher latitudes at rates
of up to 40 km per year (Burrows et al, 2014; Garcia Molinos et al.,

"To date, only two studies have directly explored the changing tropical
cyclone attributes under 1.5°C versus 2°C of global warming. Using
a high resolution global atmospheric model, Wehner et al. (2018a)
concluded that the differences in tropical cyclone statistics under 1.5°C
versus 2°C stabilization scenarios, as defined by the HAPPI protocols
(Mitchell et al., 2017) are small. Consistent with the majority of studies
performed for higher degrees of global warming, the total number
of tropical cyclones is projected to decrease under global warming,
whilst the most intense (categories 4 and 5) cyclones are projected
to occur more frequently. These very intense storms are projected
to be associated with higher peak wind speeds and lower central
pressures under 2°C versus 1.5°C of global warming. The accumulated
cyclonic energy is projected to decrease globally from 1.5°C to 2°C, in
association with a decrease in the global number of tropical cyclones
under progressively higher levels of global warming. It is also noted
that heavy rainfall associated with tropical cyclones was assessed in
the IPCC SREX as likely to increase under increasing global warming
(Seneviratne et al., 2012). Two recent articles suggest that there is
high confidence that the current level of global warming (i.e., about

with the 2017 Hurricane Harvey by about 15% or more (Risser and

"Summer sea ice in the Arctic has been retreating rapidly in recent
decades. During the period 1997 to 2014, for example, the monthly
mean sea ice extent during September (summer) decreased on average
by 130,000 km? per year (Serreze and Stroeve, 2015). This is about four
times as fast as the September sea ice loss during the period 1979
to 1996. Sea ice thickness has also decreased substantially, with an
estimated decrease in ice thickness of more than 50% in the central
Arctic (Lindsay and Schweiger, 2015). Sea ice coverage and thickness
also decrease in CMIP5 simulations of the recent past, and are
projected to decrease in the future (Collins et al., 2013). However,
the modelled sea ice loss in most CMIP5 models is much smaller

but the implications of trends detected in upwelling currents themselves
are unclear (Lluch-Cota et al, 2014). Projections of the scale of changes
between 1°C and 1.5°C of global warming and between 1.5°C and
2°C are only informed by the changes during the past increase in GMST

of future climate change indicates that a general strengthening of the
Benguela, Canary and Humboldt upwelling systems under enhanced
anthropogenic forcing (D. Wang et al., 2015) is projected to occur
(medium confidence). This strengthening is projected to be stronger
at higher latitudes. In fact, evidence from regional climate modelling
is supportive of an increase in long-shore winds at higher latitudes,

consequence of the poleward displacement of the subtropical highs
under climate change (Christensen et al., 2007; Engelbrecht et al.,

"The more recent estimates of the warming necessary to produce an ice-
free Arctic Ocean during summer are lower than the ones given in AR5
(about 2.6°C-3.1°C of global warming relative to pre-industrial levels
or 1.6°C—2.1°C relative to present-day conditions), which were similar
to the estimate of 3°C of global warming relative to pre-industrial
levels (or 2°C relative to present-day conditions) by Mahlstein and
Knutti (2012) based on bias-corrected CMIP3 models. Rosenblum and
Eisenman (2016) explained why the sensitivity estimated by Mahlstein
and Knutti (2012) might be too low, estimating instead that September
sea ice in the Arctic would disappear at 2°C of global warming
relative to pre-industrial levels (or about 1°C relative to present-day
conditions), in line with the other recent estimates. Notz and Stroeve
(2016) used the observed correlation between September sea ice
extent and cumulative CO, emissions to estimate that the Arctic Ocean
would become nearly free of sea ice during September with a further
1000 Gt of emissions, which also implies a sea ice loss at about 2°C of
global warming. Some of the uncertainty in these numbers stems from
the possible impact of aerosols (Gagne et al, 2017) and of volcanic
forcing (Rosenblum and Eisenman, 2016). During winter, little Arctic
sea ice is projected to be lost for either 1.5°C or 2°C of global warming

"Eisenman, 2017) and anthropogenic CO, emissions (Notz and Stroeve,
2016). This mismatch between the observed and modelled sensitivity
of Arctic sea ice implies that the multi-model-mean responses of future
sea ice evolution probably underestimates the sea ice loss for a given
amount of global warming. To address this issue, studies estimating
the future evolution of Arctic sea ice tend to bias correct the model
simulations based on the observed evolution of Arctic sea ice in
response to global warming. Based on such bias correction, pre-AR5
and post-AR5 studies generally agree that for 1.5°C of global warming
relative to pre-industrial levels, the Arctic Ocean will maintain a sea ice
cover throughout summer in most years (Collins et al, 2013; Notz and
Stroeve, 2016; Screen and Williamson, 2017; Jahn, 2018; Niederdrenk

chances of a sea ice-free Arctic during summer are substantially higher
(Screen and Williamson, 2017; Jahn, 2018; Niederdrenk and Notz,
2018; Screen et al., 2018; Sigmond et al, 2018). Model simulations
suggest that there will be at least one sea ice-free Arctic> summer after
approximately 10 years of stabilized warming at 2°C, as compared
to one sea ice-free summer after 100 years of stabilized warming at
1.5°C above pre-industrial temperatures (Jahn, 2018; Screen et al.,
2018; Sigmond et al., 2018). For a specific given year under stabilized
warming of 2°C, studies based on large ensembles of simulations with
a single model estimate the likelihood of ice-free conditions as 35%
without a bias correction of the underlying model (Sanderson et al.,
2017; Jahn, 2018); as between 10% and >99% depending on the
observational record used to correct the sensitivity of sea ice decline
to global warming in the underlying model (Niederdrenk and Notz,
2018); and as 19% based on a procedure to correct for biases in the
climatological sea ice coverage in the underlying model (Sigmond et
al., 2018). The uncertainty of the first year of the occurrence of an ice-
free Arctic Ocean arising from internal variability is estimated to be
about 20 years (Notz, 2015; Jahn et al, 2016).

onwards. Collins et al. (2013) assessed low confidence in Antarctic

been rising since the late 19th century from the low rates of change that
characterized the previous two millennia (Church et al., 2013). Slowing
in the reported rate over the last two decades (Cazenave et al., 2014)
may be attributable to instrumental drift in the observing satellite
system (Watson et al., 2015) and increased volcanic activity (Fasullo

contributions from thermal expansion, glacier and ice-sheet mass loss,

anthropogenic forcing since 1970 (15 + 55% before 1950, 69 + 31%

"A limited number of processes-based studies are relevant to GMSL in
1.5°C and 2°C worlds. Marzeion et al. (2018) used a global glacier model

the difference between 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming and found
little difference between scenarios in the glacier contribution to GMSL
for the year 2100 (54-97 mm relative to present-day levels for 1.5°C
and 63-112 mm for 2°C, using a 90% confidence interval). This arises
because glacier melt during the remainder of the century is dominated
by the response to warming from pre-industrial to present-day levels,
which is in turn a reflection of the slow response times of glaciers. Fiirst

to GMSL using an ice-flow model forced by the regional climate
model Modéle Atmosphérique Régional (MAR; considered by Church

RCP2.6 range of 24-60 mm (1 standard deviation) by the end of the

"The Antarctic ice sheet can contribute both positively, through increases
in outflow (solid ice lost directly to the ocean), and negatively, through
increases in snowfall (owing to the increased moisture-bearing capacity
of a warmer atmosphere), to future GMSL rise. Frieler et al. (2015)
suggested a range of 3.5-8.7% °C"" for this effect, which is consistent
with ARS. Observations from the Amundsen Sea sector of Antarctica
suggest an increase in outflow (Mouginot et al, 2014) over recent
decades associated with grounding line retreat (Rignot et al., 2014)
and the influx of relatively warm Circumpolar Deepwater (Jacobs et al.,
2011). Literature on the attribution of these changes to anthropogenic

RCP2.6-based projections of Antarctic outflow (Levermann et al.,

snowfall changes) are consistent with the AR5 assessment of Church

substantial additional GMSL rise by Marine Ice Sheet Instability or

even small (0.1—0.2 m) rises. Schleussner et al. (2011) emulated the

up to 1°C higher than that in the pre-industrial period (1850-1900); high-latitude warming was 2°C—4°C (Capron et al., 2017), while
temperature in the tropics changed little (Marcott et al., 2013). Both HTM and LIG experienced atmospheric CO, levels similar to
pre-industrial conditions (Masson-Delmotte et al. 2013). During the MPWP, the most recent time period when CO, concentrations
were similar to present-day levels, the global temperature was >1°C and Arctic temperatures about 8°C warmer than pre-industrial
(Brigham-Grette et al., 2013).

"Reconstructed global sea level rise of 6-9 m during the LIG and possibly >6 m during the MPWP requires a retreat of either the
Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets or both (Dutton et al., 2015). While ice sheet and climate models suggest a substantial retreat
of the West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) and parts of the East Antarctic ice sheet (DeConto and Pollard, 2016) during these periods,
direct observational evidence is still lacking. Evidence for ice retreat in Greenland is stronger, although a complete collapse of the
Greenland ice sheet during the LIG can be excluded (Dutton et al., 2015). Rates of past sea level rises under modest warming were
similar to or up to two times larger than rises observed over the past two decades (Kopp et al., 2013). Given the long time scales
required to reach equilibrium in a warmer world, sea level rise will likely continue for millennia even if warming is limited to 2°C.

"Although imperfect as analogues for the future, these regional changes can inform risk assessments such as the potential for
crossing irreversible thresholds or amplifying anthropogenic changes (Box 3.3, Figure 1). For example, HTM and LIG greenhouse gas
(GHG) concentrations show no evidence of runaway greenhouse gas releases under limited global warming. Transient releases of
CO, and CH, may follow permafrost melting, but these occurrences may be compensated by peat growth over longer time scales (Yu
et al., 2010). Warming may release CO, by enhancing soil respiration, counteracting CO, fertilization of plant growth (Frank et al.,
2010). Evidence of a collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) during these past events of limited global
warming could not be found (Galaasen et al., 2014).

"Ocean acidification is a result of increasing CO, in the atmosphere
(very high confidence) and is most pronounced where temperatures
are lowest (e.g., polar regions) or where CO,-rich water is brought to
the ocean surface by upwelling (Feely et al., 2008). Acidification can
also be influenced by effluents from natural or disturbed coastal land
use (Salisbury et al., 2008), plankton blooms (Cai et al, 2011), and
the atmospheric deposition of acidic materials (Omstedt et al., 2015).
These sources may not be directly attributable to climate change,
but they may amplify the impacts of ocean acidification (Bates and

ions and gases, which are in turn affected by precipitation, evaporation,
storms, river runoff, coastal erosion, up-welling, ice formation, and the
activities of organisms and ecosystems (Stocker et al., 2013). Ocean
chemistry is changing alongside increasing global temperature, with
impacts projected at 1.5°C and, more so, at 2°C of global warming

the upper layers of the ocean include altered pH, oxygen content and
sea level. Despite its many component processes, ocean chemistry has
been relatively stable for long periods of time prior to the industrial
period (Honisch et al., 2012). Ocean chemistry is changing under the
influence of human activities and rising greenhouse gases (virtually
certain, Rhein et al. 2013; Stocker et al. 2013). About 30% of CO,

"Ocean salinity is changing in directions that are consistent with
surface temperatures and the global water cycle (i.e., precipitation
versus evaporation). Some regions, such as northern oceans and the
Arctic, have decreased in salinity, owing to melting glaciers and ice
sheets, while others have increased in salinity, owing to higher sea
surface temperatures and evaporation (Durack et al., 2012). These
changes in salinity (i.e., density) are also potentially contributing to
large-scale changes in water movement (Section 3.3.8).

"Oxygen varies regionally and with depth; it is highest in polar regions
and lowest in the eastern basins of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and
in the northern Indian Ocean (Doney et al, 2014; Karstensen et al.,
2015; Schmidtko et al. 2017). Increasing surface water temperatures
have reduced oxygen in the ocean by 2% since 1960, with other
variables such as ocean acidification, sea level rise, precipitation, wind
and storm patterns playing roles (Schmidtko et al., 2017). Changes
to ocean mixing and metabolic rates, due to increased temperature
and greater supply of organic carbon to deep areas, has increased the
frequency of ‘dead zones’, areas where oxygen levels are so low that
they no longer support oxygen dependent life (Diaz and Rosenberg,
2008). The changes are complex and include both climate change and
other variables (Altieri and Gedan, 2015), and are increasing in tropical
as well as temperate regions (Altieri et al., 2017).

changes in phenology, geographic and altitudinal range shifts in flora

"Although physical changes in streamflow and continental runoff that

the scarcity assessment needs to take into account various factors, such
as the operations of water supply infrastructure and human water use
behaviour (Mehran et al., 2017), as well as green water, water quality
and environmental flow requirements (J. Liu et al, 2017). Over the past

parts of the world, especially in semi-arid and arid regions such as
California in the USA (AghaKouchak et al., 2015; Mehran et al. 2015).

"to greenhouse gas forcing at the global scale (Hansen and Stone,

atmospheric and ocean temperature can be confidently attributed to
anthropogenic forcing, while attribution to anthropogenic forcing of
changes related to precipitation are by comparison less clear. Moreover,
there is no strong direct relationship between the robustness of climate
attribution and that of impact attribution (Hansen and Stone, 2016).
The observed changes in human systems are amplified by the loss
of ecosystem services (e.g., reduced access to safe water) that are
supported by biodiversity (Oppenheimer et al., 2014). Limited research
on the risks of warming of 1.5°C and 2°C was conducted following
ARS for most key economic sectors and services, for livelihoods and
poverty, and for rural areas. For these systems, climate is one of many
drivers that result in adverse outcomes. Other factors include patterns
of demographic change, socio-economic development, trade and
tourism. Further, consequences of climate change for infrastructure,
tourism, migration, crop yields and other impacts interact with
underlying vulnerabilities, such as for individuals and communities
engaged in pastoralism, mountain farming and artisanal fisheries, to
affect livelihoods and poverty (Dasgupta et al., 2014).

"The differences in projected changes to levels of runoff under 1.5°C
and 2°C of global warming, particularly those that are regional, are
described in Section 3.3.5. Constraining warming to 1.5°C instead
of 2°C might mitigate the risks for water availability, although
socio-economic drivers could affect water availability more than the
risks posed by variation in warming levels, while the risks are not
homogeneous among regions (medium confidence) (Gerten et al.,
2013; Hanasaki et al., 2013; Arnell and Lloyd-Hughes, 2014; Schewe et
al., 2014; Karnauskas et al., 2018). Assuming a constant population in
the models used in his study, Gerten et al. (2013) determined that an
additional 8% of the world population in 2000 would be exposed to
new or aggravated water scarcity at 2°C of global warming. This value
was almost halved — with 50% greater reliability — when warming was
constrained to 1.5°C. People inhabiting river basins, particularly in the
Middle East and Near East, are projected to become newly exposed
to chronic water scarcity even if global warming is constrained to
less than 2°C. Many regions, especially those in Europe, Australia
and southern Africa, appear to be affected at 1.5°C if the reduction
in water availability is computed for non-water-scarce basins as well
as for water-scarce regions. Out of a contemporary population of
approximately 1.3 billion exposed to water scarcity, about 3% (North
America) to 9% (Europe) are expected to be prone to aggravated
scarcity at 2°C of global warming (Gerten et al., 2013). Under the
Shared Socio-Economic Pathway (SSP)2 population scenario, about 8%
of the global population is projected to experience a severe reduction
in water resources under warming of 1.7°C in 2021-2040, increasing
to 14% of the population under 2.7°C in 2043-2071, based on the
criteria of discharge reduction of either >20% or >1 standard deviation
(Schewe et al., 2014). Depending on the scenarios of SSP1—5, exposure
to the increase in water scarcity in 2050 will be globally reduced by
184-270 million people at about 1.5°C of warming compared to the
impacts at about 2°C. However, the variation between socio-economic
levels is larger than the variation between warming levels (Arnell and

increase in potential flood fatality (5.7%) is projected without any

the projected increase in potential economic loss (0.9%) is relatively

"A number of caveats are noted for studies projecting changes to climatic
range. This approach, for example, does not incorporate the effects of
extreme weather events and the role of interactions between species.
As well, trophic interactions may locally counteract the range expansion
of species towards higher altitudes (Brathen et al, 2018). There is also
the potential for highly invasive species to become established in new
areas as the climate changes (Murphy and Romanuk, 2014), but there is
no literature that quantifies this possibility for 1.5°C of global warming.

"In summary, limiting warming to 1.5°C compared with 2°C may avoid
advance in spring phenology (high confidence) by perhaps a few days
(medium confidence) and hence decrease the risks of loss of ecosystem
functionality due to phenological mismatch between trophic levels,
and also of maladaptation coming from the sensitivity of many species
to increased climate variability. Nevertheless, this difference between
1.5°C and 2°C of warming might be limited for plants that are able to
expand their range.

"There is no literature that directly estimates the proportion of species at
increased risk of global (as opposed to local) commitment to extinction
as a result of climate change, as this is inherently difficult to quantify.
However, it is possible to compare the proportions of species at risk
of very high range loss; for example, a discernibly smaller number of
terrestrial species are projected to lose over 90% of their range at
1.5°C of global warming compared with 2°C (Figure 2 in Warren et
al., 2018a). A link between very high levels of range loss and greatly
increased extinction risk may be inferred (Urban, 2015). Hence, limiting
global warming to 1.5°C compared with 2°C would be expected to
reduce both range losses and associated extinction risks in terrestrial

be interpreted cautiously (Duputié et al., 2015), and considered in the
context of accompanying changes in climate variability (e.g., increased
risk of frost damage for plants or earlier emergence of insects resulting in
mortality during cold spells). Another adaptive response of some plants is
range expansion with increased vigour and altered herbivore resistance
in their new range, analogous to invasive plants (Macel et al., 2017).

range losses at 1.5°C were significantly lower for plants than those at
2°C of warming (Smith et al., 2018). It should be noted that at 1.5°C
of warming, and if species’ ability to disperse naturally to track their
preferred climate geographically is inhibited by natural or anthropogenic
obstacles, there would still remain 10% of the amphibians, 8% of the

8% of the plants which are projected to lose over half their range, while
species on average lose 20-27% of their range (Warren et al, 2018a).
Given that bird and mammal species can disperse more easily than
amphibians and reptiles, a small proportion can expand their range
as climate changes, but even at 1.5°C of warming the total range loss
integrated over all birds and mammals greatly exceeds the integrated

this finding; for example, the spatial and interspecific variance in bird

Further, a recent meta-analysis of 27 studies concerning a total of 976

they may become invasive or harmful to human or natural systems
(Settele et al, 2014). Some studies are beginning to locate ‘refugial’
areas where the climate remains suitable in the future for most of the
species currently present. For example, Smith et al. (2018) estimated
that 5.5-14% more of the globe's terrestrial land area could act as
climatic refugia for plants under 1.5°C of warming compared to 2°C.

"In conclusion, ecosystem respiration is expected to increase with
increasing temperature, thus reducing soil carbon storage. Soil carbon
storage is expected to be larger if global warming is restricted to
1.5°C, although some of the associated changes will be countered by
enhanced gross primary production due to elevated CO, concentrations
(ie., the ‘fertilization effect’) and higher temperatures, especially at

ecosystems, highly biodiverse tropical wet and dry forests, deserts,
freshwater systems and dune systems, were assessed in ARS. These
include Mediterranean areas in Europe, Siberian, tropical and desert
ecosystems in Asia, Australian rainforests, the Fynbos and succulent
Karoo areas of South Africa, and wetlands in Ethiopia, Malawi, Zambia

"There is limited published literature examining modelled land carbon
changes specifically under 1.5°C of warming, but existing CMIP5
models and published data are used in this report to draw some
conclusions. For systems with significant inertia, such as vegetation or
soil carbon stores, changes in carbon storage will depend on the rate
of change of forcing and thus depend on the choice of scenario (Jones
et al., 2009; Ciais et al, 2013; Sihi et al., 2017). To avoid legacy effects
of the choice of scenario, this report focuses on the response of gross
primary productivity (GPP) — the rate of photosynthetic carbon uptake
— by the models, rather than by changes in their carbon store.

"At the global level, linear scaling is acceptable for net primary production,
biomass burning and surface runoff, and impacts on terrestrial carbon
storage are projected to be greater at 2°C than at 1.5°C (Tanaka et
al, 2017). If global CO, concentrations and temperatures stabilize, or
peak and decline, then both land and ocean carbon sinks — which are
primarily driven by the continued increase in atmospheric CO, — will
also decline and may even become carbon sources (Jones et al., 2016).
Consequently, if a given amount of anthropogenic CO, is removed from
the atmosphere, an equivalent amount of land and ocean anthropogenic
CO, will be released to the atmosphere (Cao and Caldeira, 2010).

"The increase in total ecosystem respiration in spring and autumn,
associated with higher temperatures, may convert boreal forests
from carbon sinks to carbon sources (Hadden and Grelle, 2016). In
boreal peatlands, for example, increased temperature may diminish
carbon storage and compromise the stability of the peat (Dieleman
et al, 2016). In addition, J. Yang et al. (2015) showed that fires reduce
the carbon sink of global terrestrial ecosystems by 0.57 PgC yr“ in
ecosystems with large carbon stores, such as peatlands and tropical
forests. Consequently, for adaptation purposes, it is necessary to
enhance carbon sinks, especially in forests which are prime regulators
within the water, energy and carbon cycles (Ellison et al., 2017). Soil can
also be a key compartment for substantial carbon sequestration (Lal,
2014; Minasny et al., 2017), depending on the net biome productivity
and the soil quality (Bispo et al, 2017).

"Figure 3.17 shows different responses of the terrestrial carbon cycle
to climate change in different regions. The models show a consistent
response of increased GPP in temperate latitudes of approximately 2
GtC yr °C"". Similarly, Gang et al. (2015) projected a robust increase
in the net primary productivity (NPP) of temperate forests. However,
Ahlstrém et al. (2012) showed that this effect could be offset or reversed
by increases in decomposition. Globally, most models project that GPP
will increase or remain approximately unchanged (Hashimoto et al.,
2013). This projection is supported by findings by Sakalli et al. (2017)
for Europe using Euro-CORDEX regional models under a 2°C global
warming for the period 2034-2063, which indicated that storage
will increase by 5% in soil and by 20% in vegetation. However, using
the same models Jacob et al. (2018) showed that limiting warming
to 1.5°C instead of 2°C avoids an increase in ecosystem vulnerability
(compared to a no-climate change scenario) of 40-50%.

"Working Group II of AR5 (Settele et al, 2014) concluded that there is
high confidence that net terrestrial ecosystem productivity at the global
scale has increased relative to the pre-industrial era and that rising
CO, concentrations are contributing to this trend through stimulation
of photosynthesis. There is, however, no clear and consistent signal
of a climate change contribution. In northern latitudes, the change in
productivity has a lower velocity than the warming, possibly because of
a lack of resource and vegetation acclimation mechanisms (M. Huang
et al, 2017). Biomass and soil carbon stocks in terrestrial ecosystems
are currently increasing (high confidence), but they are vulnerable to
loss of carbon to the atmosphere as a result of projected increases in
the intensity of storms, wildfires, land degradation and pest outbreaks
(Settele et al, 2014; Seidl et al, 2017). These losses are expected to
contribute to a decrease in the terrestrial carbon sink. Anderegg et al.
(2015) demonstrated that total ecosystem respiration at the global
scale has increased in response to increases in night-time temperature
(1 PgC yr °C"", P=0.02).

"ARS assessed that large uncertainty remains regarding the land carbon
cycle behaviour of the future (Ciais et al, 2013), with most, but not all,
CMIP5 models simulating continued terrestrial carbon uptake under
all four RCP scenarios (Jones et al, 2013). Disagreement between
models outweighs differences between scenarios even up to the year
2100 (Hewitt et al., 2016; Lovenduski and Bonan, 2017). Increased
atmospheric CO, concentrations are expected to drive further increases
in the land carbon sink (Ciais et al., 2013; Schimel et al., 2015), which
could persist for centuries (Pugh et al., 2016). Nitrogen, phosphorus and
other nutrients will limit the terrestrial carbon cycle response to both
elevated CO, and altered climate (Goll et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2014;
Wieder et al., 2015; Zaehle et al., 2015; Ellsworth et al., 2017). Climate
change may accelerate plant uptake of carbon (Gang et al., 2015)
but also increase the rate of decomposition (Todd-Brown et al., 2014;
Koven et al., 2015; Crowther et al., 2016). Ahlstrom et al. (2012) found
a net loss of carbon in extra-tropical regions and the largest spread
across model results in the tropics. The projected net effect of climate
change is to reduce the carbon sink expected under CO, increase alone
(Settele et al, 2014). Friend et al. (2014) found substantial uptake of
carbon by vegetation under future scenarios when considering the
effects of both climate change and elevated CO,.

disturbance and permafrost degradation (Bring et al., 2016; DeBeer et

facilitate the establishment of woody species in tundra areas. Arctic
terrestrial ecosystems are being disrupted by delays in winter onset
and mild winters associated with global warming (high confidence)
(Cooper, 2014). Observational constraints suggest that stabilization
at 1.5°C of warming would avoid the thawing of approximately 1.5
to 2.5 million km? of permafrost (medium confidence) compared
with stabilization at 2°C (Chadburn et al., 2017), but the time scale
for release of thawed carbon as CO, or CH, should be many centuries

projected to increase by about 3-12 days at 1.5°C and 6-16 days at
2°C of warming (medium confidence) (Zhou et al., 2018). Aalto et al.

Warmer and drier conditions in particular facilitate fire, drought and insect

from wind and pathogens (Seidl et al 2017). Particularly vulnerable
regions are Central and South America, Mediterranean Basin, South
Africa, South Australia where the drought risk will increase (see Figure

human derived CO, emissions (Green and Page, 2017). Moreover, in the
Congo basin (Dargie et al., 2017) and in the Amazonian basin (Draper et

forest. However, stored carbon is vulnerable to land-use change and
future risk of drought, for example in northeast Brazil (high confidence)
(Figure 3.12, Section 3.3.4.2). At the global scale, these peatlands are
undergoing rapid major transformations through drainage and burning
in preparation for oil palm and other crops or through unintentional
burning (Magrin et al., 2014). Wetland salinization, a widespread
threat to the structure and ecological functioning of inland and coastal
wetlands, is occurring at a high rate and large geographic scale (Section
3.3.6; Herbert et al., 2015). Settele et al. (2014) found that rising water
temperatures are projected to lead to shifts in freshwater species
distributions and worsen water quality. Some of these ecosystems
respond non-linearly to changes in temperature. For example, Johnson
and Poiani (2016) found that the wetland function of the Prairie Pothole
region in North America is projected to decline at temperatures beyond
a local warming of 2°C-3°C above present-day values (1°C local
warming, corresponding to 0.6°C of global warming). If the ratio of local
to global warming remains similar for these small levels of warming,
this would indicate a global temperature threshold of 1.2°C-1.8°C
of warming. Hence, constraining global warming to approximately
1.5°C would maintain the functioning of prairie pothole ecosystems in
terms of their productivity and biodiversity, although a 20% increase
of precipitation could offset 2°C of global warming (high confidence)

"In many places around the world, the savanna boundary is moving
into former grasslands. Woody encroachment, including increased
tree cover and biomass, has increased over the past century, owing
to changes in land management, rising CO, levels, and climate
variability and change (often in combination) (Settele et al., 2014). For
plant species in the Mediterranean region, shifts in phenology, range
contraction and health decline have been observed with precipitation
decreases and temperature increases (medium confidence) (Settele

approaches have shown that there is a regional-scale threshold in the
Mediterranean region between 1.5°C and 2°C of warming (Guiot and
Cramer, 2016; Schleussner et al., 2016b). Further, Guiot and Cramer
(2016) concluded that biome shifts unprecedented in the last 10,000
years can only be avoided if global warming is constrained to 1.5°C
(medium confidence) — whilst 2°C of warming will result in a decrease
of 12-15% of the Mediterranean biome area. The Fynbos biome in
southwestern South Africa is vulnerable to the increasing impact of
fires under increasing temperatures and drier winters. It is projected
to lose about 20%, 45% and 80% of its current suitable climate area
under 1°C, 2°C and 3°C of global warming, respectively, compared to
1961-1990 (high confidence) (Engelbrecht and Engelbrecht, 2016). In
Australia, an increase in the density of trees and shrubs at the expense
of grassland species is occurring across all major ecosystems and is
projected to be amplified (NCCARF, 2013). Regarding Central America,
Lyra et al. (2017) showed that the tropical rainforest biomass would be
reduced by about 40% under global warming of 3°C, with considerable
replacement by savanna and grassland. With a global warming of close
to 1.5°C in 2050, a biomass decrease of 20% is projected for tropical

summer sea ice (Section 3.3.8), and decreased the overall solubility
of the ocean for oxygen (Section 3.3.10). Importantly, changes in the

term gains. Fisheries, for example, may expand temporarily at high
latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere as the extent of summer sea ice
recedes and NPP increases (medium confidence) (Cheung et al., 2010;

in the productivity of high-latitude fisheries are offset by a growing
number of examples from low and mid-latitudes where increases in

effects of elevated temperatures and/or reduced ocean mixing from
reduced ocean upwelling, that is, increased stratification (low-medium

around the planet (Section 3.3.7). The movement of these factors
drives local and regional climates, as well as primary productivity and
food production. Firmly attributing recent changes in the strength and
direction of ocean currents to climate change, however, is complicated
by long-term patterns and variability (e.g., Pacific decadal oscillation,
PDO; Signorini et al., 2015) and a lack of records that match the long-
term nature of these changes in many cases (Lluch-Cota et al., 2014).An
assessment of the literature since AR5 (Sydeman et al., 2014), however,
concluded that (overall) upwelling-favourable winds have intensified
in the California, Benguela and Humboldt upwelling systems, but
have weakened in the Iberian system and have remained neutral in
the Canary upwelling system in over 60 years of records (1946-2012)

consensus that wind-driven upwelling systems are likely to intensify
under climate change in many upwelling systems (Sydeman et al.,

"Sea level rise also amplifies the impacts of storms and wave action
(Section 3.3.9), with robust evidence that storm surges and damage
are already penetrating farther inland than a few decades ago,
changing conditions for coastal ecosystems and human communities.
This is especially true for small islands (Box 3.5) and low-lying coastal
communities, where issues such as storm surges can transform coastal
areas (Section 3.4.5; Brown et al., 2018a). Changes in the frequency of
extreme events, such as an increase in the frequency of intense storms,
have the potential (along with other factors, such as disease, food web
changes, invasive organisms and heat stress-related mortality; Burge

likely to be of central importance, the literature on how climate change
might influence ocean chemistry over the short and long term is limited

to the carbonate chemistry of seawater are having, and are likely to
continue to have, fundamental and substantial impacts on a wide variety
of organisms (high confidence). Organisms with shells and skeletons
made out of calcium carbonate are particularly at risk, as are the early
life history stages of a large number of organisms and processes such

latitude and depth, with the greatest changes occurring at high latitudes
as well as deeper regions. The aragonite saturation horizon (i.e., where
concentrations of calcium and carbonate fall below the saturation point
for aragonite, a key crystalline form of calcium carbonate) is decreasing
with depth as anthropogenic CO, penetrates deeper into the ocean over

including ocean mixing, photosynthesis, respiration and solubility
(Boyd et al, 2014, 2015; Portner et al., 2014; Breitburg et al, 2018).
Concentrations of oxygen in the ocean are declining (high confidence)
owing to three main factors related to climate change: (i) heat-related
stratification of the water column (less ventilation and mixing), (ii)
reduced oxygen solubility as ocean temperature increases, and (iii)
impacts of warming on biological processes that produce or consume
oxygen such as photosynthesis and respiration (high confidence) (Bopp

al, 2018). Further, a range of processes (Section 3.4.11) are acting
synergistically, including factors not related to climate change, such
as runoff and coastal eutrophication (e.g., from coastal farming
and intensive aquaculture). These changes can lead to increased
phytoplankton productivity as a result of the increased concentration
of dissolved nutrients. Increased supply of organic carbon molecules
from coastal run-off can also increase the metabolic activity of coastal
microbial communities (Altieri and Gedan, 2015; Bakun et al., 2015;

greatest challenges, as abyssal seafloor habitats in areas of deep-water

concentrations by as much as 0.03 mL L™ by 2100 (Levin and Le Bris,

"Risks of climate change impacts for seagrass and mangrove ecosystems
were recently assessed by an expert group led by Short et al. (2016).
Impacts of climate change were assessed to be similar across a range
of submerged and emerged plants. Submerged plants such as sea-
grass were affected mostly by temperature extremes (Arias-Ortiz et al.,
2018), and indirectly by turbidity, while emergent communities such
as mangroves and salt marshes were most susceptible to sea level
variability and temperature extremes, which is consistent with other
evidence (Di Nitto et al., 2014; Sierra-Correa and Cantera Kintz, 2015;
Osorio et al., 2016; Sasmito et al., 2016), especially in the context of
human activities that reduce sediment supply (Lovelock et al., 2015)
or interrupt the shoreward movement of mangroves though the
construction of coastal infrastructure. This in turn leads to ‘coastal
squeeze’ where coastal ecosystems are trapped between changing
ocean conditions and coastal infrastructure (Mills et al, 2016).
Projections of the future distribution of seagrasses suggest a poleward
shift, which raises concerns that low-latitude seagrass communities
may contract as a result of increasing stress levels (Valle et al, 2014).

storm surges, infrastructure damage, erosion and habitat loss (Church et
al., 2013; Stocker et al, 2013; Blankespoor et al., 2014). Coastal wetland
ecosystems such as mangroves, sea grasses and salt marshes are under

ecosystems (e.g., mangroves) may be able to shift shoreward as sea levels

often interrupts shoreward shifts, as well as reducing sediment supplies

the impact of climate change on fisheries via impacts on net primary

habitat for mangroves can be strongly affected by human actions such
as building dams which reduce the sediment supply and hence the
ability of mangroves to escape ‘drowning’ as sea level rises (Lovelock

coastal human communities (Arkema et al., 2013; Temmerman et al.,

"te conclusion that tropical corals may be even more vulnerable to
climate change than indicated in assessments made in 2014 (Hoegh-

also considered the heatwave-related loss of 50% of shallow-water
corals across hundreds of kilometres of the world’s largest continuous
coral reef system, the Great Barrier Reef. These large-scale impacts,
plus the observation of back-to-back bleaching events on the Great
Barrier Reef (predicted two decades ago, Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999) and
arriving sooner than predicted (Hughes et al., 2017b, 2018), suggest
that the research community may have underestimated climate risks
for coral reefs (Figure 3.18). The general assessment of climate risks for
mangroves prior to this special report was that they face greater risks
from deforestation and unsustainable coastal development than from
climate change (Alongi, 2008; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014; Gattuso et

underestimated for mangroves as well. With the events of the last past
three years in mind, risks are now considered to be undetectable to
moderate (i.e., moderate risks now start at 1.3°C as opposed to 1.8°C;
medium confidence). Consequently, when average global warming
reaches 1.3°C above pre-industrial levels, the risk of climate change to
mangroves are projected to be moderate (Figure 3.18) while tropical
coral reefs will have reached a high level of risk as examplified by
increasing damage from heat stress since the early 1980s. At global
warming of 1.8°C above pre-industrial levels, seagrasses are projected
to reach moderate to high levels of risk (e.g., damage resulting from
sea level rise, erosion, extreme temperatures, and storms), while risks
to mangroves from climate change are projected to remain moderate
(e.g., not keeping up with sea level rise, and more frequent heat stress
mortality) although there is low certainty as to when or if this important
ecosystem is likely to transition to higher levels of additional risk from

aragonite saturation horizon, are likely to also play key roles (Kawaguchi
et al., 2013; Pifiones and Fedorov, 2016). As with many risks associated
with impacts at the ecosystem scale, most adaptation options focus on
the management of stresses unrelated to climate change but resulting
from human activities, such as pollution and habitat destruction.
Reducing these stresses will be important in efforts to maintain important
foodweb components. Fisheries management at local to regional scales
will be important in reducing stress on foodweb organisms, such as
those discussed here, and in helping communities and industries adapt
to changing foodweb structures and resources (see further discussion of
fisheries per se below; Section 3.4.6.3). One strategy is to maintain larger
population levels of fished species in order to provide more resilient
stocks in the face of challenges that are increasingly driven by climate
change (Green et al., 2014; Bell and Taylor, 2015).

"bivalve molluscs (e.g., clams, oysters and mussels), are filter-feeding
invertebrates. These invertebrate organisms underpin important
fisheries and aquaculture industries, from polar to tropical regions, and
are important food sources for a range of organisms including humans.
The third group of organisms considered here is a globally significant
group of invertebrates known as euphausiid crustaceans (krill), which
are a key food source for many marine organisms and hence a major
link between primary producers and higher trophic levels (e.g., fish,
mammals and sea birds). Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, are among
the most abundant species in terms of mass and are consequently an
essential component of polar foodwebs (Atkinson et al., 2009). The last
group, fin fishes, is vitally important components of ocean foodwebs,
contribute to the income of coastal communities, industries and nations,
and are important to the foodsecurity and livelihood of hundreds of
millions of people globally (FAO, 2016). Further background for this

"As GMST increases by 1.5°C and more, the risk of impacts from ocean
warming and acidification are expected to be moderate to high, except
in the case of bivalves (mid-latitudes) where the risks of impacts are
projected to be high to very high (Figure 3.18). Ocean warming and
acidification are already affecting the life history stages of bivalve
molluscs (e.g., Asplund et al., 2014; Mackenzie et al., 2014; Waldbusser

Wang et al., 2016; Castillo et al., 2017; Lemasson et al., 2017; Ong et al.,

growth, increased respiration and reduced calcification, whereas
larval stages tend to show greater developmental abnormalities and
increased mortality after exposure to these conditions (medium to high
confidence) (Q. Wang et al., 2016; Lemasson et al., 2017; Ong et al.,
2017; X. Zhao et al, 2017). Risks are expected to accumulate at higher
temperatures for bivalve molluscs, with very high risks expected at
1.8°C of warming or more. This general pattern applies to low-latitude
fin fish, which are expected to experience moderate to high risks of
impact at 1.3°C of global warming (medium confidence), and very high
risks at 1.8°C at low latitudes (medium confidence) (Figure 3.18).

"The ocean provides important services, including the regulation of
atmospheric composition via gas exchange across the boundary
between ocean and atmosphere, and the storage of carbon in vegetation
and soils associated with ecosystems such as mangroves, salt marshes
and coastal peatlands. These services involve a series of physicochemical
processes which are influenced by ocean chemistry, circulation, biology,
temperature and biogeochemical components, as well as by factors other
than climate (Boyd, 2015). The ocean is also a net sink for CO, (another
important service), absorbing approximately 30% of human emissions
from the burning of fossil fuels and modification of land use (IPCC, 2013).
Carbon uptake by the ocean is decreasing (lida et al, 2015), and there is
increasing concern from observations and models regarding associated
changes to ocean circulation (Sections 3.3.7 and 3.4.4., Rahmstorf et
al., 2015b);. Biological components of carbon uptake by the ocean are
also changing, with observations of changing net primary productivity
(NPP) in equatorial and coastal upwelling systems (medium confidence)
(Lluch-Cota et al, 2014; Sydeman et al, 2014; Bakun et al, 2015), as
well as subtropical gyre systems (low confidence) (Signorini et al, 2015).
There is general agreement that NPP will decline as ocean warming and
acidification increase (medium confidence) (Bopp et al., 2013; Boyd et al.,
2014; Pértner et al., 2014; Boyd, 2015).

ecosystems and sectors at 1.0°C, 1.5°C and 2.0°C of warming of the average sea surface temperature (SST) relative to the pre-industrial period. The grey bar represents the
range of GMST for the most recent decade: 2006-2015. The assessment of changing risk levels and associated confidence were primarily derived from the expert judgement
of Gattuso et al. (2015) and the lead authors and relevant contributing authors of Chapter 3 (SR1.5), while additional input was received from the many reviewers of the
ocean systems section of SR1.5. Notes: (i) The analysis shown here is not intended to be comprehensive. The examples of organisms, ecosystems and sectors included here are
intended to illustrate the scale, types and projection of risks for representative natural and human ocean systems. (ii) The evaluation of risks by experts did not consider genetic
adaptation, acclimatization or human risk reduction strategies (mitigation and societal adaptation). (iii) As discussed elsewhere (Sections 3.3.10 and 3.4.4.5, Box 3.4; Gattuso
et al., 2015), ocean acidification is also having impacts on organisms and ecosystems as carbon dioxide increases in the atmosphere. These changes are part of the responses
reported here, although partitioning the effects of the two drivers is difficult at this point in time and hence was not attempted. (iv) Confidence levels for location of transition
points between levels of risk (L = low, M = moderate, H = high and VH = very high) are assessed and presented here as in the accompanying study by Gattuso et al. (2015).
Three transitions in risk were possible: W—Y (white to yellow), Y—R (yellow to red), and R-P (red to purple), with the colours corresponding to the level of additional risk posed
by climate change. The confidence levels for these transitions were assessed, based on level of agreement and extent of evidence, and appear as letters associated with each

"Adaptations to the broad global changes in carbon uptake by the ocean
are limited and are discussed later in this report with respect to changes
in NPP and implications for fishing industries. These adaptation options
are broad and indirect, and the only other solution at large scale is
to reduce the entry of CO, into the ocean. Strategies for adapting to
reduced coastal protection involve (a) avoidance of vulnerable areas
and hazards, (b) managed retreat from threatened locations, and/or (c)
accommodation of impacts and loss of services (Bell, 2012; André et al.,
2016; Cooper et al., 2016; Mills et al, 2016; Raabe and Stumpf, 2016; Fu

the construction of seawalls and artificial reefs (Rinkevich, 2014, 2015;

"Coral-dominated reefs are found along coastlines between latitudes 30°S and 30°N, where they provide habitat for over a million
species (Reaka-Kudla, 1997) and food, income, coastal protection, cultural context and many other services for millions of people
in tropical coastal areas (Burke et al., 2011; Cinner et al., 2012; Kennedy et al., 2013; Pendleton et al., 2016). Ultimately, coral reefs
are underpinned by a mutualistic symbiosis between reef-building corals and dinoflagellates from the genus Symbiodinium (Hoegh-
Guldberg et al., 2017). Warm-water coral reefs are found down to depths of 150 m and are dependent on light, making them distinct
from the cold deep-water reef systems that extend down to depths of 2000 m or more. The difficulty in accessing deep-water reefs
also means that the literature on the impacts of climate change on these systems is very limited by comparison to those on warm-
water coral reefs (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2017). Consequently, this Box focuses on the impacts of climate change on warm-water
(tropical) coral reefs, particularly with respect to their prospects under average global surface temperatures of 1.5°C and 2°C above

"Recent studies have increasingly stressed the need for coastal protection
to be considered within the context of coastal land management,
including protecting and ensuring that coastal ecosystems are able to
undergo shifts in their distribution and abundance as climate change
occurs (Clausen and Clausen, 2014; Martinez et al, 2014; Cui et al.,
2015; André et al., 2016; Mills et al., 2016). Facilitating these changes
will require new tools in terms of legal and financial instruments, as
well as integrated planning that involves not only human communities
and infrastructure, but also associated ecosystem responses and values
(Bell, 2012; Mills et al, 2016). In this regard, the interactions between
climate change, sea level rise and coastal disasters are increasingly
being informed by models (Bosello and De Cian, 2014) with a widening
appreciation of the role of natural ecosystems as an alternative to
hardened coastal structures (Cooper et al., 2016). Adaptation options
for tropical coral reef recreation include: (i) protecting and improving
biodiversity and ecological function by minimizing the impact of
stresses unrelated to climate change (e.g., pollution and overfishing),
(ii) ensuring adequate levels of coastal protection by supporting and
repairing ecosystems that protect coastal regions, (iii) ensuring fair
and equitable access to the economic opportunities associated with
recreational activities, and (iv) seeking and protecting supplies of water
for tourism, industry and agriculture alongside community needs.

"The predictions of back-to-back bleaching events (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999) have become the reality in the summers of 2016-2017

capable and are currently predicting the large-scale loss of coral reefs by mid-century under even low-emissions scenarios (Hoegh-

"Given the sensitivity of corals to heat stress, even short periods of overshoot (i.e., decades) are expected to be extremely damaging
to coral reefs. Losing 70-90% of today’s coral reefs, however, will remove resources and increase poverty levels across the world’s
tropical coastlines, highlighting the key issue of equity for the millions of people that depend on these valuable ecosystems
(Cross-Chapter Box 6; Spalding et al., 2014; Halpern et al., 2015). Anticipating these challenges to food and livelihoods for coastal
communities will become increasingly important, as will adaptation options, such as the diversification of livelihoods and the
development of new sustainable industries, to reduce the dependency of coastal communities on threatened ecosystems such as
coral reefs (Cinner et al., 2012, 2016; Pendleton et al., 2016). At the same time, coastal communities will need to pre-empt changes
to other services provided by coral reefs such as coastal protection (Kennedy et al., 2013; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014; Pértner et
al., 2014; Gattuso et al., 2015). Other threats and challenges to coastal living, such as sea level rise, will amplify challenges from
declining coral reefs, specially for SIDS and low-lying tropical nations. Given the scale and cost of these interventions, implementing
them earlier rather than later would be expedient.

"The assumptions underpinning these assessments are considered to be highly conservative. In some cases, ‘optimistic’ assumptions
in models include rapid thermal adaptation by corals of 0.2°C—1°C per decade (Donner et al., 2005) or 0.4°C per decade (Schleussner
et al, 2016b), as well as very rapid recovery rates from impacts (e.g., five years in the case of Schleussner et al., 2016b). Adaptation
to climate change at these high rates, has not been documented, and recovery from mass mortality tends to take much longer
(>15 years; Baker et al., 2008). Probability analysis also indicates that the underlying increases in sea temperatures that drive coral
bleaching and mortality are 25% less likely under 1.5°C when compared to 2°C (King et al., 2017). Spatial differences between
the rates of heating suggest the possibility of temporary climate refugia (Caldeira, 2013; van Hooidonk et al., 2013; Cacciapaglia
and van Woesik, 2015; Keppel and Kavousi, 2015), which may play an important role in terms of the regeneration of coral reefs,
especially if these refuges are protected from risks unrelated to climate change. Locations at higher latitudes are reporting the arrival
of reef-building corals, which may be valuable in terms of the role of limited refugia and coral reef structures but will have low
biodiversity (high confidence) when compared to present-day tropical reefs (Kersting et al., 2017). Similarly, deep-water (30-150
m) or mesophotic coral reefs (Bongaerts et al., 2010; Holstein et al., 2016) may play an important role because they avoid shallow
water extremes (i.e., heat and storms) to some extent, although the ability of these ecosystems to assist in repopulating damaged
shallow water areas may be limited (Bongaerts et al., 2017).

"The distribution and abundance of coral reefs has decreased by approximately 50% over the past 30 years (Gardner et al., 2005;
Bruno and Selig, 2007; De’ath et al., 2012) as a result of pollution, storms, overfishing and unsustainable coastal development (Burke
et al., 2011; Halpern et al., 2015; Cheal et al., 2017). More recently, climate change (i.e., heat stress; Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999; Baker
et al., 2008; Spalding and Brown, 2015; Hughes et al., 2017b) has emerged as the greatest threat to coral reefs, with temperatures
of just 1°C above the long-term summer maximum for an area (reference period 1985-1993) over 4-6 weeks being enough to
cause mass coral bleaching (loss of the symbionts) and mortality (very high confidence) (WGII AR5, Box 18-2; Cramer et al., 2014).
Ocean warming and acidification can also slow growth and calcification, making corals less competitive compared to other benthic
organisms such as macroalgae or seaweeds (Dove et al., 2013; Reyes-Nivia et al, 2013, 2014). As corals disappear, so do fish and
many other reef-dependent species, which directly impacts industries such as tourism and fisheries, as well as the livelihoods for
many, often disadvantaged, coastal people (Wilson et al., 2006; Graham, 2014; Graham et al., 2015; Cinner et al., 2016; Pendleton et
al., 2016). These impacts are exacerbated by increasingly intense storms (Section 3.3.6), which physically destroy coral communities
and hence reefs (Cheal et al., 2017), and by ocean acidification (Sections 3.3.10 and 3.4.4.5), which can weaken coral skeletons,
contribute to disease, and slow the recovery of coral communities after mortality events (low to medium confidence) (Gardner et
al., 2005; Dove et al., 2013; Kennedy et al., 2013; Webster et al., 2013; Hoegh-Guldberg, 2014b; Anthony, 2016). Ocean acidification
also leads to enhanced activity by decalcifying organisms such as excavating sponges (Kline et al., 2012; Dove et al., 2013; Fang et

resulting in salinization, flooding, and erosion and in the future are
projected to affect human and ecological systems, including health,
heritage, freshwater availability, biodiversity, agriculture, fisheries and
other services, with different impacts seen worldwide (high confidence).
Owing to the commitment to SLR, there is an overlapping uncertainty
in projections at 1.5°C and 2°C (Schleussner et al., 2016b; Sanderson

differ at different time horizons (Schleussner et al., 2016b; Brown et

these are distinct from impacts associated with higher increases in
temperature (e.g., 4°C or more, as discussed in Brown et al., 2018a)
over centennial scales. The benefits of climate change mitigation
reinforce findings of earlier IPCC reports (e.g., Wong et al., 2014).

stabilized or occurs later in time, this figure is likely to differ because
of the commitment to SLR. Raising existing dikes helps protect against
SLR, substantially reducing risks, although other forms of adaptation
exist. By 2300, dike heights under a non-mitigation scenario (RCP8.5)
could be more than 2 m higher (on average for 136 megacities) than
under climate change mitigation scenarios at 1.5°C or 2°C (Nicholls

"Observations of SLR and human influence are felt through salinization,
which leads to mixing in deltas and estuaries, aquifers, leading to
flooding (also enhanced by precipitation and river discharge), land
degradation and erosion. Salinization is projected to impact freshwater
sources and pose risks to ecosystems and human systems (Section
5.4; Wong et al., 2014). For instance, in the Delaware River estuary on
the east coast of the USA, upward trends of salinity (measured since
the 1900s), accounting for the effects of streamflow and seasonal
variations, have been detected and SLR is a potential cause (Ross et

Whilst islands are highly vulnerable to SLR (high confidence), they are
also reactive to change. Small islands are impacted by multiple climatic
stressors, with SLR being a more important stressor to some islands

intrusion than future land-use/land-cover change in the Snohomish
River estuary in Washington state (USA). This resulted in a shift in
the salinity both upstream and downstream in low flow conditions.
Projecting impacts in deltas needs an understanding of both fluvial
discharge and SLR, making projections complex because the drivers
operate on different temporal and spatial scales (Zaman et al., 2017;

projected to be reached in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta may be less
than the most extreme annual flood depth seen today, taking into
account SLR, surges, tides, bathymetry and local river flows (Brown et

Migration (internal and international) has always been important

changing environmental and weather conditions being just one factor in
the choice to migrate (Sections 3.4.10, 4.3.5.6 and 5.3.2; Campbell and
Warrick, 2014). Whilst flooding may result in migration or relocation,
for example in Vunidogoloa, Fiji (McNamara and Des Combes, 2015;
Gharbaoui and Blocher, 2016) and the Solomon Islands (Albert et al.,

"the impacts of SLR and wave-induced flooding (within a temperature
horizon equivalent of 1.5°C), could affect freshwater availability on
Roi-Namur, Marshall Islands, but is also dependent on other extreme
weather events. Freshwater resources may also be affected by
a 0.40 m rise in sea level (which may be experienced with a 1.5°C
warming) in other Pacific atolls (Terry and Chui, 2012). Whilst SLR is
a major hazard for atolls, islands reaching higher elevations are also
threatened given that there is often a lot of infrastructure located near
the coast (high confidence) (Kumar and Taylor, 2015; Nicholls et al.,
2018). Tens of thousands of people on small islands are exposed to
SLR (Rasmussen et al., 2018). Giardino et al. (2018) found that hard
defence structures on the island of Ebeye in the Marshall Islands were
effective in reducing damage due to SLR at 1.5°C and 2°C. Additionally,
damage was also reduced under mitigation scenarios compared with
non-mitigation scenarios. In Jamaica and St Lucia, SLR and extreme
sea levels are projected to threaten transport system infrastructure at
1.5°C unless further adaptation is undertaken (Monioudi et al., 2018).
Slower rates of SLR will provide a greater opportunity for adaptation
to be successful (medium confidence), but this may not be substantial
enough on islands with a very low mean elevation. Migration and/or
relocation may be an adaptation option (Section 3.4.10). Thomas and
Benjamin (2017) highlight three areas of concern in the context of loss
and damage at 1.5°C: a lack of data, gaps in financial assessments,
and a lack of targeted policies or mechanisms to address these issues
(Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5). Small islands are projected to

of SLR on shoreline change (Le Cozannet et al., 2014), as it is highly
site specific (e.g., Romine et al., 2013). Infrastructure and geological
constraints reduce shoreline movement, causing coastal squeeze. In
Japan, for example, SLR is projected to cause beach losses under an
RCP2.6 scenario, which will worsen under RCP8.5 (Udo and Takeda,
2017). Further, compound flooding (the combined risk of flooding from
multiple sources) has increased significantly over the past century in
major coastal cities (Wahl et al., 2015) and is likely to increase with

"Bangladeshi Ganges-Brahmaputra, Indian Bengal, Indian Mahanadi

exposed unless sedimentation occurs (Brown et al., 2018b). Other
deltas are similarly vulnerable. SLR is only one factor affecting deltas,
and assessment of numerous geophysical and anthropogenic drivers
of geomorphic change is important (Tessler et al., 2018). For example,
dike building to reduce flooding and dam building (Gupta et al, 2012)
restricts sediment movement and deposition, leading to enhanced
subsidence, which can occur at a greater rate than SLR (Auerbach
et al., 2015; Takagi et al, 2016). Although dikes remain essential for
reducing flood risk today, promoting sedimentation is an advisable
strategy (Brown et al, 2018b) which may involve nature-based
solutions. Transformative decisions regarding the extent of sediment
restrictive infrastructure may need to be considered over centennial
scales (Brown et al., 2018b). Thus, in a 1.5°C or 2°C warmer world,
deltas, which are home to millions of people, are expected to be highly

"Since AR5, planned and autonomous adaptation and forward planning
have become more widespread (Araos et al., 2016; Nicholls et al.,
2018), but continued efforts are required as many localities are in the
early stages of adapting or are not adapting at all (Cross-Chapter Box
Yin Chapter 4; Araos et al., 2016). This is region and sub-sector specific,
and also linked to non-climatic factors (Ford et al., 2015; Araos et al.,
2016; Lesnikowski et al, 2016). Adaptation pathways (e.g., Ranger et
al., 2013; Barnett et al., 2014; Rosenzweig and Solecki, 2014; Buurman

practices despite knowledge of long-term risks (Section 4.2.2).
Furthermore, human retreat and migration are increasingly being
considered as an adaptation response (Hauer et al., 2016; Geisler and
Currens, 2017), with a growing emphasis on green adaptation. There
are few studies on the adaptation limits to SLR where transformation
change may be required (AR5-Section 5.5 of Wong et al., 2014; Nicholls

ecosystem functions (Herbert et al., 2015). Some projections of wetland
change, with magnitudes (but not necessarily rates or timing) of SLR

wetlands in the 21st century (e.g., Blankespoor et al., 2014; Cui et al.,
2015; Arnell et al., 2016; Crosby et al., 2016), whilst others report a net
gain with wetland transgression (e.g., Raabe and Stumpf, 2016 in the
Gulf of Mexico). However, the feedback between wetlands and sea
level is complex, with parameters such as a lack of accommodation
space restricting inland migration, or sediment supply and feedbacks
between plant growth and geomorphology (Kirwan and Megonigal,

deliver long-term benefits, with natural sedimentation rates more likely
keep up with SLR. It remains unclear how wetlands will respond and
under what conditions (including other climate parameters) to a global

century, decreasing the need for extensive and, in places, immediate
adaptation. Adaptation will reduce impacts in human settings (high
confidence) (Hinkel et al., 2014; Wong et al., 2014), although there is
less certainty for natural ecosystems (Sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3.3). While
some ecosystems (e.g., mangroves) may be able to move shoreward
as sea levels increase, coastal development (e.g., coastal building,
seawalls and agriculture) often interrupt these transitions (Saunders et

the impact of other stresses such as those arising from tourism, fishing,
coastal development and unsustainable aquaculture/agriculture. In
some cases, restoration of coastal habitats and ecosystems can be a
cost-effective way of responding to changes arising from increasing
levels of exposure from rising sea levels, changes in storm conditions,

"Quantifying the observed impacts of climate change on food security
and food production systems requires assumptions about the many
non-climate variables that interact with climate change variables.
Implementing specific strategies can partly or greatly alleviate the
climate change impacts on these systems (Wei et al., 2017), whilst the
degree of compensation is mainly dependent on the geographical area
and crop type (Rose et al., 2016). Despite these uncertainties, recent
studies confirm that observed climate change has already affected crop
suitability in many areas, resulting in changes in the production levels
of the main agricultural crops. These impacts are evident in many areas
of the world, ranging from Asia (C. Chen et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2015;
He and Zhou, 2016) to America (Cho and McCarl, 2017) and Europe
(Ramirez-Cabral et al., 2016), and they particularly affect the typical
local crops cultivated in specific climate conditions (e.g., Mediterranean
crops like olive and grapevine, Moriondo et al. 2013a, b).

"Temperature and precipitation trends have reduced crop production
and yields, with the most negative impacts being on wheat and maize
(Lobell et al., 2011), whilst the effects on rice and soybean yields are
less clear and may be positive or negative (Kim et al., 2013; van Oort
and Zwart, 2018).Warming has resulted in positive effects on crop yield
in some high-latitude areas (Jaggard et al., 2007; Supit et al, 2010;
Gregory and Marshall, 2012; C. Chen et al., 2014; Sun et al, 2015; He
and Zhou, 2016; Daliakopoulos et al., 2017), and may make it possible
to have more than one harvest per year (B. Chen et al., 2014; Sun et
al., 2015). Climate variability has been found to explain more than
60% of the of maize, rice, wheat and soybean yield variations in the
main global breadbaskets areas (Ray et al, 2015), with the percentage
varying according to crop type and scale (Moore and Lobell, 2015; Kent
et al, 2017). Climate trends also explain changes in the length of the
growing season, with greater modifications found in the northern high-
latitude areas (Qian et al., 2010; Mueller et al., 2015).

"The rise in tropospheric ozone has already reduced yields of wheat,
tice, maize and soybean by 3-16% globally (Van Dingenen et al.,
2009). In some studies, increases in atmospheric CO, concentrations
were found to increase yields by enhancing radiation and water use
efficiencies (Elliott et al, 2014; Durand et al., 2018). In open-top
chamber experiments with a combination of elevated CO, and 1.5°C of
warming, maize and potato yields were observed to increase by 45.7%
and 11%, respectively (Singh et al., 2013; Abebe et al., 2016). However,
observations of trends in actual crop yields indicate that reductions
as a result of climate change remain more common than crop yield
increases, despite increased atmospheric CO, concentrations (Porter
et al., 2014). For instance, McGrath and Lobell (2013) indicated that
production stimulation at increased atmospheric CO, concentrations
was mostly driven by differences in climate and crop species, whilst
yield variability due to elevated CO, was only about 50-70% of the
variability due to climate. Importantly, the faster growth rates induced
by elevated CO, have been found to coincide with lower protein content
in several important C3 cereal grains (Myers et al., 2014), although this
may not always be the case for C4 grains, such as sorghum, under

"Crop yields in the future will also be affected by projected changes in
temperature and precipitation. Studies of major cereals showed that
maize and wheat yields begin to decline with 1°C—-2°C of local warming
and under nitrogen stress conditions at low latitudes (high confidence)
(Porter et al, 2014; Rosenzweig et al., 2014). A few studies since ARS
have focused on the impacts on cropping systems for scenarios where
the global mean temperature increase is within 1.5°C. Schleussner et
al. (2016b) projected that constraining warming to 1.5°C rather than
2°C would avoid significant risks of declining tropical crop yield in
West Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central and South America. Ricke et al.
(2016) highlighted that cropland stability declines rapidly between 1°C
and 3°C of warming, whilst Bassu et al. (2014) found that an increase
in air temperature negatively influences the modelled maize yield
response by —0.5 t ha~' °C"" and Challinor et al. (2014) reported similar
effect for tropical regions. Niang et al. (2014) projected significantly
lower risks to crop productivity in Africa at 1.5°C compared to 2°C of
warming. Lana et al. (2017) indicated that the impact of temperature
increases on crop failure of maize hybrids would be much greater as
temperatures increase by 2°C compared to 1.5°C (high confidence). J.
Huang et al. (2017) found that limiting warming to 1.5°C compared
to 2°C would reduce maize yield losses over drylands. Although
Rosenzweig et al. (2017, 2018) did not find a clear distinction between
yield declines or increases in some breadbasket regions between the
two temperature levels, they generally did find projections of decreasing
yields in breadbasket regions when the effects of CO, fertilization were
excluded. lizumi et al. (2017) found smaller reductions in maize and
soybean yields at 1.5°C than at 2°C of projected warming, higher rice
production at 2°C than at 1.5°C, and no clear differences for wheat
on a global mean basis. These results are largely consistent with those
of other studies (Faye et al, 2018; Ruane et al., 2018). In the western
Sahel and southern Africa, moving from 1.5°C to 2°C of warming has
been projected to result in a further reduction of the suitability of maize,
sorghum and cocoa cropping areas and yield losses, especially for C3
crops, with rainfall change only partially compensating these impacts
(Laderach et al., 2013; World Bank, 2013; Sultan and Gaetani, 2016).

for both natural grassland in France (Graux et al, 2013) and sown
pastures in Australia (Perring et al., 2010). Water resource availability
for livestock is expected to decrease owing to increased runoff and
reduced groundwater resources. Increased temperature will likely
induce changes in river discharge and the amount of water in basins,
leading human and livestock populations to experience water stress,

"Global fisheries and aquaculture contribute a total of 88.6 and 59.8
million tonnes of fish and other products annually (FAO, 2016),
and play important roles in the food security of a large number of
countries (McClanahan et al., 2015; Pauly and Charles, 2015) as well
as being essential for meeting the protein demand of a growing
global population (Cinner et al, 2012, 2016; FAO, 2016; Pendleton
et al, 2016). A steady increase in the risks associated with bivalve
fisheries and aquaculture at mid-latitudes is coincident with increases
in temperature, ocean acidification, introduced species, disease and
other drivers ( Lacoue-Labarthe et al, 2016; Clements and Chopin,
2017; Clements et al, 2017; Parker et al, 2017). Sea level rise and
storm intensification pose a risk to hatcheries and other infrastructure
(Callaway et al, 2012; Weatherdon et al., 2016), whilst others risks
are associated with the invasion of parasites and pathogens (Asplund
et al., 2014; Castillo et al., 2017). Specific human strategies have
reduced these risks, which are expected to be moderate under RCP2.6
and very high under RCP8.5 (Gattuso et al., 2015). The risks related
to climate change for fin fish (Section 3.4.4) are producing a number
of challenges for small-scale fisheries (e.g., Kittinger, 2013; Pauly and
Charles, 2015; Bell et al., 2018). Recent literature from 2015 to 2017
has described growing threats from rapid shifts in the biogeography
of key species (Poloczanska et al., 2013, 2016; Burrows et al., 2014;
Garcia Molinos et al, 2015) and the ongoing rapid degradation of
key ecosystems such as coral reefs, seagrass and mangroves (Section
3.4.4, Box 3.4). The acceleration of these changes, coupled with non-
climate stresses (e.g., pollution, overfishing and unsustainable coastal
development), are driving many small-scale fisheries well below the
sustainable harvesting levels required to maintain these resources
as a source of food (McClanahan et al., 2009, 2015; Cheung et al.,
2010; Pendleton et al., 2016). As a result, future scenarios surrounding
climate change and global population growth increasingly project
shortages of fish protein for many regions, such as the Pacific Ocean
(Bell et al, 2013, 2018) and Indian Ocean (McClanahan et al., 2015).
Mitigation of these risks involves marine spatial planning, fisheries
repair, sustainable aquaculture, and the development of alternative
livelihoods (Kittinger, 2013; McClanahan et al, 2015; Song and
Chuenpagdee, 2015; Weatherdon et al., 2016). Other threats concern
the increasing incidence of alien species and diseases (Kittinger et al.,
2013; Weatherdon et al., 2016).

higher latitudes, with more fertile soils, favouring crops, and grassland production, in contrast to the situation at low latitudes (Section

regional climate change risks on crop production are strongly influenced by the use of different regional climate change projections

CO, fertilization effects may not be realized in the field; further, they are often accompanied by losses in protein and nutrient content of
crops (Section 3.6), and hence these projected benefits may not be realized. In addition, some micronutrients such as iron and zinc will

sectors such as livestock rearing and aquaculture (ICEM, 2013). Ecosystem-based approaches, such as integrated water resources
management, demonstrate successes in mainstreaming adaptation into existing strategies (Sebesvari et al, 2017). However, some of
these adaptive strategies can have negative impacts that deepen the divide between land-wealthy and land-poor farmers (Chapman

increasing debt for land-poor farmers (Chapman and Darby, 2016).

Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand and Viet Nam that was established in 1995. The MRC has facilitated impact assessment studies, regional
capacity building and local project implementation (Schipper et al., 2010), although the mainstreaming of adaptation into development
policies has lagged behind needs (Gass et al., 2011). Existing adaptation interventions can be strengthened through greater flexibility
of institutions dealing with land-use planning and agricultural production, improved monitoring of saline intrusion, and the installation
of early warning systems that can be accessed by the local authorities or farmers (Renaud et al., 2015; Hoang et al., 2016; Tran et al.,

adaptation measures (e.g., land-use change) (Smajgl et al., 2015; Hoang et al., 2018); combinations of top-down government-led (e.g.,

Shanghai, China) could become heat stressed, exposing more than
350 million more people to deadly heat by 2050 under midrange
population growth. Without considering adaptation options, such
as cooling from more reflective roofs, and overall characteristics of
urban agglomerations in terms of land use, zoning and building codes

Stabilizing at 1.5°C of warming instead of 2°C could decrease mortality

expected to be a poverty multiplier that makes poor people poorer and
increases the poverty head count (Hallegatte et al, 2016; Hallegatte
and Rozenberg, 2017). Poor people might be heavily affected by climate
change even when impacts on the rest of population are limited.
Climate change alone could force more than 3 million to 16 million
people into extreme poverty, mostly through impacts on agriculture
and food prices (Hallegatte et al., 2016; Hallegatte and Rozenberg,
2017). Unmitigated warming could reshape the global economy later
in the century by reducing average global incomes and widening
global income inequality (Burke et al., 2015b). The most severe impacts
are projected for urban areas and some rural regions in sub-Saharan
Africa and Southeast Asia.

"The limited new research since AR5 supports the notion that increases
in global temperatures will impact the transportation sector. Warming
is projected to result in increased numbers of days of ice-free navigation
and a longer shipping season in cold regions, thus affecting shipping
and reducing transportation costs (Arent et al., 2014). In the North Sea
Route, large-scale commercial shipping might not be possible until
2030 for bulk shipping and until 2050 for container shipping under
RCP8.5. A 0.05% increase in mean temperature is projected from an
increase in short-lived pollutants, as well as elevated CO, and non-CO,
emissions, associated with additional economic growth enabled by the
North Sea Route. (Yumashev et al. 2017). Open water vessel transit
has the potential to double by mid-century, with a two to four month
longer season (Melia et al., 2016).

"In Europe, no major differences in large-scale wind energy resources
or in inter- or intra-annual variability are projected for 2016-2035
under RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 (Carvalho et al., 2017). However, in 2046-
2100, wind energy density is projected to decrease in eastern Europe
(-30%) and increase in Baltic regions (+30%). Intra-annual variability
is expected to increase in northern Europe and decrease in southern
Europe. Under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, the annual energy yield of European
wind farms as a whole, as projected to be installed by 2050, will remain
stable (+5 yield for all climate models). However, wind farm yields are
projected to undergo changes of up to 15% in magnitude at country
and local scales and of 5% at the regional scale (Tobin et al, 2015,
2016). Hosking et al. (2018) assessed wind power generation over
Europe for 1.5°C of warming and found the potential for wind energy
to be greater than previously assumed in northern Europe. Additionally,
Tobin et al. (2018) assessed impacts under 1.5°C and 2°C of warming
on wind, solar photovoltaic and thermoelectric power generation
across Europe. These authors found that photovoltaic and wind power
might be reduced by up to 10%, and hydropower and thermoelectric
generation might decrease by up to 20%, with impacts being limited
at 1.5°C of warming but increasing as temperature increases (Tobin et
al., 2018).

"Displacement: At 2°C of warming, there is a potential for significant
population displacement concentrated in the tropics (Hsiang and Sobel,
2016). Tropical populations may have to move distances greater than
1000 km if global mean temperature rises by 2°C from 2011-2030 to
the end of the century. A disproportionately rapid evacuation from the
tropics could lead to a concentration of population in tropical margins
and the subtropics, where population densities could increase by 300%
or more (Hsiang and Sobel, 2016).

"Internal and international migration have always been important for
small islands (Farbotko and Lazrus, 2012; Weir et al., 2017). There is
rarely a single cause for migration (Constable, 2017). Numerous factors
are important, including work, education, quality of life, family ties,
access to resources, and development (Bedarff and Jakobeit, 2017;
Speelman et al., 2017; Nicholls et al., 2018). Depending on the situation,
changing weather, climate or environmental conditions might each be
a factor in the choice to migrate (Campbell and Warrick, 2014).
"	Text
"The literature on compound as well as interacting and cascading risks
at warming of 1.5°C and 2°C is limited. Spatially compound risks,
often referred to as hotspots, involve multiple hazards from different
sectors overlapping in location (Piontek et al. 2014). Global exposures
were assessed for 14 impact indicators, covering water, energy and
land sectors, from changes including drought intensity and water
stress index, cooling demand change and heatwave exposure, habitat
degradation, and crop yields using an ensemble of climate and impact
models (Byers et al., 2018). Exposures are projected to approximately
double between 1.5°C and 2°C, and the land area affected by climate
risks is expected to increase as warming progresses. For populations
vulnerable to poverty, the exposure to climate risks in multiple sectors
could be an order of magnitude greater (8-32 fold) in the high poverty
and inequality scenarios (SSP3; 765—-1,220 million) compared to under
sustainable socio-economic development (SSP1; 23-85 million). Asian
and African regions are projected to experience 85-95% of global
exposure, with 91-98% of the exposed and vulnerable population
(depending on SSP/GMT combination), approximately half of which
are in South Asia. Figure 3.19 shows that moderate and large multi-
sector impacts are prevalent at 1.5°C where vulnerable people live,
predominantly in South Asia (mostly Pakistan, India and China), but that
impacts spread to sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and East Asia at
higher levels of warming. Beyond 2°C and at higher risk thresholds,
the world’s poorest populations are expected to be disproportionately
impacted, particularly in cases (SSP3) of great inequality in Africa and
southern Asia. Table 3.4 shows the number of exposed and vulnerable
people at 1.5°C and 2°C of warming, with 3°C shown for context, for
selected multi-sector risks.

"Conflict: A recent study has called for caution in relating conflict
to climate change, owing to sampling bias (Adams et al, 2018).
Insufficient consideration of the multiple drivers of conflict often leads
to inconsistent associations being reported between climate change
and conflict (e.g., Hsiang et al., 2013; Hsiang and Burke, 2014; Buhaug,
2015, 2016; Carleton and Hsiang, 2016; Carleton et al. 2016). There
also are inconsistent relationships between climate change, migration
and conflict (e.g., Theisen et al., 2013; Buhaug et al., 2014; Selby, 2014;
Christiansen, 2016; Brzoska and Frohlich, 2016; Burrows and Kinney,
2016; Reyer et al., 2017c; Waha et al., 2017). Across world regions and
from the international to micro level, the relationship between drought
and conflict is weak under most circumstances (Buhaug, 2016; von
Uexkull et al., 2016). However, drought significantly increases the
likelihood of sustained conflict for particularly vulnerable nations or
groups, owing to the dependence of their livelihood on agriculture.
This is particularly relevant for groups in the least developed countries
(von Uexkull et al., 2016), in sub-Saharan Africa (Serdeczny et al., 2016;
Almer et al., 2017) and in the Middle East (Waha et al, 2017). Hsiang
et al. (2013) reported causal evidence and convergence across studies
that climate change is linked to human conflicts across all major
regions of the world, and across a range of spatial and temporal scales.
A 1°C increase in temperature or more extreme rainfall increases
the frequency of intergroup conflicts by 14% (Hsiang et al., 2013). If
the world warms by 2°C—4°C by 2050, rates of human conflict could
increase. Some causal associations between violent conflict and
socio-political instability were reported from local to global scales
and from hour to millennium time frames (Hsiang and Burke, 2014).
A temperature increase of one standard deviation increased the risk
of interpersonal conflict by 2.4% and intergroup conflict by 11.3%
(Burke et al., 2015a). Armed-conflict risks and climate-related disasters
are both relatively common in ethnically fractionalized countries,
indicating that there is no clear signal that environmental disasters
directly trigger armed conflicts (Schleussner et al, 2016a).

the frequency and intensity of the events, as well as the extent of

and the effect of non-climate stressors). Moderate risks posed by

warming, however, biome shifts and species range losses are expected
to escalate to very high levels, and the systems are projected to have
very little capacity to adapt (Figure 3.20) (high confidence) (Section
3.4.3).
"	Text
"In the Arctic (related to RFC1), the increased rate of summer sea ice
melt was detected and attributed to climate change by the year 2000
(corresponding to warming of 0.7°C), indicating moderate risk. At
1.5°C of warming an ice-free Arctic Ocean is considered unlikely, whilst
by 2°C of warming it is considered /ikely and this unique ecosystem is
projected to be unable to adapt. Hence, a transition from high to very
high risk is expected between 1.5°C and 2°C of warming.
"	Text
"The transition from undetectable to moderate risk (related to RFCs 3
and 4), shown as white to yellow in Figure 3.20, is based on AR5 WGll
Chapter 7, which indicated with high confidence that climate change
impacts on crop yields have been detected and attributed to climate
change, and the current assessment has provided further evidence
to confirm this (Section 3.4.6). Impacts have been detected in the
tropics (AR5 WGIl Chapters 7 and 18), and regional risks are projected
to become high in some regions by 1.5°C of warming, and in many
regions by 2.5°C, indicating a transition from moderate to high risk
between 1.5°C and 2.5°C of warming (medium confidence).
"	Text
"In terrestrial ecosystems (feeding into RFC1 and RFC4), detection and
attribution studies show that impacts of climate change on terrestrial
ecosystems began to take place over the past few decades, indicating
a transition from no risk (white areas in Figure 3.20) to moderate risk
below recent temperatures (high confidence) (Section 3.4.3). Risks to
unique and threatened terrestrial ecosystems are generally projected to
be higher under warming of 2°C compared to 1.5°C (Section 3.5.2.1),
while at the global scale severe and widespread risks are projected
to occur by 2°C of warming. These risks are associated with biome
shifts and species range losses (Sections 3.4.3 and 3.5.2.4); however,
because many systems and species are projected to be unable to adapt
to levels of warming below 2°C, the transition to high risk (red areas

"The current synthesis is complementary to the synthesis in Section 3.5.2
that categorizes risks into ‘Reasons for Concern’ (RFCs), as described in
Oppenheimer et al. (2014). Each element, or burning ember, presented
here (Figures 3.18, 3.20) maps to one or more RFCs (Figure 3.21). It
should be emphasized that risks to the elements assessed here are
only a subset of the full range of risks that contribute to the RFCs.
Figures 3.18 and 3.20 are not intended to replace the RFCs but rather
to indicate how risks to particular elements of the Earth system accrue
with global warming, through the visual burning embers format,
with a focus on levels of warming of 1.5°C and 2°C. Key evidence
assessed in earlier parts of this chapter is summarized to indicate the
transition points between the levels of risk. In this regard, the assessed
confidence in assigning the transitions between risk levels are as
follows: L=Low, M=Medium, H=High, and VH=Very high levels of
confidence. A detailed account of the procedures involved is provided
in the Supplementary Material (3.SM.3.2 and 3.SM.3.3).

"Some elements of the assessment in Section 3.4 were synthesized into
Figure 3.18 and 3.20, indicating the overall risk for a representative set
of natural and human systems from increases in global mean surface
temperature (GMST) and anthropogenic climate change. The elements
included are supported by a substantive enough body of literature
providing at least medium confidence in the assessment. The format for
Figures 3.18 and 3.20 match that of Figure 19.4 of WGII ARS Chapter
19 (Oppenheimer et al., 2014) indicating the levels of additional risk
as colours: undetectable (white) to moderate (detected and attributed;
yellow), from moderate to high (severe and widespread; red), and
from high to very high (purple), the last of which indicates significant
irreversibility or persistence of climate-related hazards combined
with a much reduced capacity to adapt. Regarding the transition
from undetectable to moderate, the impact literature assessed in AR5
focused on describing and quantifying linkages between weather and
climate patterns and impact outcomes, with limited detection and
attribution to anthropogenic climate change (Cramer et al., 2014). A
more recent analysis of attribution to greenhouse gas forcing at the
global scale (Hansen and Stone, 2016) confirmed that the impacts
related to changes in regional atmospheric and ocean temperature can
be confidently attributed to anthropogenic forcing, while attribution
to anthropogenic forcing of those impacts related to precipitation is
only weakly evident or absent. Moreover, there is no strong direct
relationship between the robustness of climate attribution and that of
impact attribution (Hansen and Stone, 2016).
"	Text
"For warm-water coral reefs, there is high confidence in the transitions
between risk levels, especially in the growing impacts in the
transition of warming from non-detectable (0.2°C to 0.4°C), and then
successively higher levels risk until high and very high levels of risks
by 1.2°C (Section 3.4.4 and Box 3.4). This assessment considered the
heatwave-related loss of 50% of shallow water corals across hundreds
of kilometres of the world’s largest continuous coral reef system,
the Great Barrier Reef, as well as losses at other sites globally. The
major increase in the size and loss of coral reefs over the past three
years, plus sequential mass coral bleaching and mortality events on
the Great Barrier Reef, (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999; Hughes et al. 2017b,
2018), have reinforced the scale of climate-change related risks to
coral reefs. General assessments of climate-related risks for mangroves
prior to this special report concluded that they face greater risks from
deforestation and unsustainable coastal development than from
climate change (Alongi, 2008; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014; Gattuso et
al, 2015). Recent climate-related die-offs (Duke et al., 2017; Lovelock
et al, 2017), however, suggest that climate change risks may have
been underestimated for mangroves as well, and risks have thus been
assessed as undetectable to moderate, with the transition now starting
at 1.3°C as opposed to 1.8°C as assessed in 2015 (Gattuso et al., 2015).
Risks of impacts related to climate change on small-scale fisheries at
low latitudes, many of which are dependent on ecosystems such as
coral reefs and mangroves, are moderate today but are expected to
reach high levels of risk around 0.9°C—-1.1°C (high confidence) (Section
3.4.4.10).

(Section 3.4.5.3) and increasingly widespread by the 2070s (Brown

"For heat-related morbidity and mortality (related to RFCs 2, 3 and 4),
detection and attribution studies show heat-related mortality in some
locations increasing with climate change (high confidence) (Section
3.4.7; Ebi et al., 2017). The projected risks of heat-related morbidity and
mortality are generally higher under warming of 2°C than 1.5°C (high
confidence), with projections of greater exposure to high ambient
temperatures and increased morbidity and mortality (Section 3.4.7).
Risk levels will depend on the rate of warming and the (related) level of
adaptation, so a transition in risk from moderate (yellow) to high (red)
is located between 1°C and 3°C (medium confidence).

3.21 and from AR5 WGIl Chapter 19, Figure 19.4, and highlighting the nature of this dependence between 0°C and 2°C warming above pre-industrial levels. The selection of
impacts and risks to natural, managed and human systems is illustrative and is not intended to be fully comprehensive. Following the approach used in ARS, literature was used
to make expert judgements to assess the levels of global warming at which levels of impact and/or risk are undetectable (white), moderate (yellow), high (red) or very high
(purple). The colour scheme thus indicates the additional risks due to climate change. The transition from red to purple, introduced for the first time in AR4, is defined by a very
high risk of severe impacts and the presence of significant irreversibility or persistence of climate-related hazards combined with limited ability to adapt due to the nature of the
hazard or impact. Comparison of the increase of risk across RFCs indicates the relative sensitivity of RFCs to increases in GMST. As was done previously, this assessment takes
autonomous adaptation into account, as well as limits to adaptation independently of development pathway. The levels of risk illustrated reflect the judgements of the authors
of Chapter 3 and Gattuso et al. (2015; for three marine elements). The grey bar represents the range of GMST for the most recent decade: 2006-2015.

‘last chance to see’ tourism markets developing based on observed
impacts on environmental and cultural heritage (Section 3.4.9.1),

analyses, risks to the tourism sector are projected to be larger at 2°C

sports tourism markets being greatest. The degradation or loss of

"A brief summary of the accrual of RFCs with global warming, as
assessed in WGII ARS, is provided in the following sections, which
leads into an update of relevant literature published since ARS. The
new literature is used to confirm the levels of global warming at which
risks are considered to increase from undetectable to moderate, from
moderate to high, and from high to very high. Figure 3.21 modifies
Figure 19.4 from AR5 WGll, and the following text in this subsection
provides justification for the modifications. O'Neill et al. (2017)
presented a very similar assessment to that of WGII ARS, but with
further discussion of the potential to create ‘embers’ specific to socio-
economic scenarios in the future. There is insufficient literature to
do this at present, so the original, simple approach has been used
here. As the focus of the present assessment is on the consequences
of global warming of 1.5°C-2°C above the pre-industrial period, no
assessment for global warming of 3°C or more is included in the
figure (i.e., analysis is discontinued at 2.5°C).

"Climate change is already having large scale impacts on ecosystems,
human health and agriculture, which is making it much more difficult
to reach goals to eradicate poverty and hunger, and to protect health
and life on land (Sections 5.1 and 5.2.1 in Chapter 5), suggesting a
transition from undetectable to moderate risk for recent temperatures
at 0.5°C of warming (medium confidence). Based on the limited
analyses available, there is evidence and agreement that the risks
to sustainable development are considerably less at 1.5°C than 2°C
(Section 5.2.2), including impacts on poverty and food security. It is
easier to achieve many of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) at
1.5°C, suggesting that a transition to higher risk will not begin yet at
this level. At 2°C and higher levels of warming (e.g., RCP8.5), however,
there are high risks of failure to meet SDGs such as eradicating
poverty and hunger, providing safe water, reducing inequality and
protecting ecosystems, and these risks are projected to become severe
and widespread if warming increases further to about 3°C (medium
confidence) (Section 5.2.3).

"WGIl AR5 Chapter 19 found that some unique and threatened
systems are at risk from climate change at current temperatures,
with increasing numbers of systems at potential risk of severe
consequences at global warming of 1.6°C above pre-industrial levels.
It was also observed that many species and ecosystems have a limited
ability to adapt to the very large risks associated with warming of
2.6°C or more, particularly Arctic sea ice and coral reef systems (high
confidence). In the AR5 analysis, a transition from white to yellow
indicated that the onset of moderate risk was located below present-
day global temperatures (medium confidence); a transition from
yellow to red indicated that the onset of high risk was located at
1.6°C, and a transition from red to purple indicated that the onset
of very high risk was located at about 2.6°C. This WGII ARS analysis
already implied that there would be a significant reduction in risks
to unique and threatened systems if warming were limited to 1.5°C
compared with 2°C. Since ARS, evidence of present-day impacts in
these systems has continued to grow (Sections 3.4.2, 3.4.4 and 3.4.
5), whilst new evidence has also accumulated for reduced risks at
1.5°C compared to 2°C of warming in Arctic ecosystems (Section
3.3.9), coral reefs (Section 3.4.4) and some other unique ecosystems
(Section 3.4.3), as well as for biodiversity.

to reduce risks to both social and ecological systems in the Arctic. This

"AR3 identified a large number of threatened systems, including mountain
ecosystems, highly biodiverse tropical wet and dry forests, deserts,
freshwater systems and dune systems. These include Mediterranean
areas in Europe, Siberian, tropical and desert ecosystems in Asia,
Australian rainforests, the Fynbos and succulent Karoo areas of South
Africa, and wetlands in Ethiopia, Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe. In all
these systems, impacts accrue with greater warming and impacts at 2°C
are expected to be greater than those at 1.5°C (medium confidence).
One study since ARS has shown that constraining global warming to
1.5°C would maintain the functioning of prairie pothole ecosystems
in North America in terms of their productivity and biodiversity, whilst
warming of 2°C would not do so (Johnson et al., 2016). The large
proportion of insects projected to lose over half their range at 2°C of
warming (25%) compared to at 1.5°C (9%) also suggests a significant
loss of functionality in these threatened systems at 2°C of warming,

"New literature since ARS has provided a closer focus on the comparative
levels of risk to coral reefs at 1.5°C versus 2°C of global warming. As
assessed in Section 3.4.4 and Box 3.4, reaching 2°C will increase the
frequency of mass coral bleaching and mortality to a point at which it
will result in the total loss of coral reefs from the world’s tropical and
subtropical regions. Restricting overall warming to 1.5°C will still see
a downward trend in average coral cover (70-90% decline by mid-
century) but will prevent the total loss of coral reefs projected with
warming of 2°C (Frieler et al., 2013). The remaining reefs at 1.5°C will
also benefit from increasingly stable ocean conditions by the mid-to-
late 21st century. Limiting global warming to 1.5°C during the course
of the century may, therefore, open the window for many ecosystems
to adapt or reassort geographically. This indicates a transition in risk
in this system from high to very high (high confidence) at 1.5°C of
warming and contributes to a lowering of the transition from high to
very high (Figure 3.21) in this RFC1 compared to in AR5. Further details
of risk transitions for ocean systems are described in Figure 3.18.

expert judgements to assess the levels of global warming at which levels of impact and/or risk are undetectable (white), moderate (yellow), high (red) or very high (purple).
The colour scheme thus indicates the additional risks due to climate change. The transition from red to purple, introduced for the first time in AR4, is defined by very high risk
of severe impacts and the presence of significant irreversibility, or persistence of climate-related hazards combined with a limited ability to adapt due to the nature of the
hazard or impact. Comparison of the increase of risk across RFCs indicates the relative sensitivity of RFCs to increases in GMST. As was done previously, this assessment takes
autonomous adaptation into account, as well as limits to adaptation (RFC 1, 3, 5) independently of development pathway. The rate and timing of impacts were taken into
account in assessing RFC 1 and 5. The levels of risk illustrated reflect the judgements of the Ch 3 authors. RFC1 Unique and threatened systems: ecological and human
systems that have restricted geographic ranges constrained by climate related conditions and have high endemism or other distinctive properties. Examples include coral reefs,
the Arctic and its indigenous people, mountain glaciers and biodiversity hotspots. RFC2 Extreme weather events: risks/impacts to human health, livelihoods, assets and
ecosystems from extreme weather events such as heatwaves, heavy rain, drought and associated wildfires, and coastal flooding. RFC3 Distribution of impacts: risks/impacts
that disproportionately affect particular groups due to uneven distribution of physical climate change hazards, exposure or vulnerability. RFC4 Global aggregate impacts:
global monetary damage, global scale degradation and loss of ecosystems and biodiversity. RFC5 Large-scale singular events: are relatively large, abrupt and sometimes
irreversible changes in systems that are caused by global warming. Examples include disintegration of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. The grey bar represents the range

evidence suggests that the transition from high to very high risk in
unique and threatened systems occurs at a lower level of warming,
between 1.5°C and 2°C (high confidence), than in AR5, where this
transition was located at 2.6°C. The transition from moderate to high

literature contains little information about the potential for human
society to adapt to extreme weather events, and hence it has not been
possible to locate the transition from high to very high risk within the

forcing has contributed to a global-scale intensification of heavy
precipitation over the second half of the 20th century, for a global
warming of approximately 0.5°C (Section 3.3.3).A recent observation-
based study likewise showed that a 0.5°C increase in global mean
temperature has had a detectable effect on changes in precipitation
extremes at the global scale (Schleussner et al., 2017), thus suggesting
that there would be detectable differences in heavy precipitation at
1.5°C and 2°C of global warming. These results are consistent with
analyses of climate projections, although they also highlight a large

"Reduced risks in terms of the likelihood of occurrence of extreme
weather events are discussed in this sub-subsection for 1.5°C as
compared to 2°C of global warming, for those extreme events where
evidence is currently available based on the assessments of Section 3.3.
ARS assigned a moderate level of risk from extreme weather events at
recent temperatures (1986-2005) owing to the attribution of heat and
precipitation extremes to climate change, and a transition to high risk
beginning below 1.6°C of global warming based on the magnitude,
likelihood and timing of projected changes in risk associated with
extreme events, indicating more severe and widespread impacts.
The ARS analysis already suggested a significant benefit of limiting
warming to 1.5°C, as doing so might keep risks closer to the moderate
level. New literature since ARS has provided greater confidence in a
reduced level of risks due to extreme weather events at 1.5°C versus
2°C of warming for some types of extremes (Section 3.3 and below;

"Temperature: It is expected that further increases in the number of
warm days/nights and decreases in the number of cold days/nights,
and an increase in the overall temperature of hot and cold extremes
would occur under 1.5°C of global warming relative to pre-industrial
levels (high confidence) compared to under the present-day climate
(1°C of warming), with further changes occurring towards 2°C of
global warming (Section 3.3). As assessed in Sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.2,
impacts of 0.5°C of global warming can be identified for temperature
extremes at global scales, based on observations and the analysis of
climate models. At 2°C of global warming, it is likely that temperature
increases of more than 2°C would occur over most land regions in
terms of extreme temperatures (up to 4°C-6°C depending on region
and considered extreme index) (Section 3.3.2, Table 3.2). Regional
increases in temperature extremes can be robustly limited if global
warming is constrained to 1.5°C, with regional warmings of up to
3°C-4.5°C (Section 3.3.2, Table 3.2). Benefits obtained from this
general reduction in extremes depend to a large extent on whether the
lower range of increases in extremes at 1.5°C is sufficient for critical
thresholds to be exceeded, within the context of wide-ranging aspects
such as crop yields, human health and the sustainability of ecosystems.

damages are projected to be greater at 2°C compared to 1.5°C of
warming, further estimating that projected damages at 1.5°C remain
similar to today’s levels of economic damage. The third study, by M.
Burke et al. (2018) used an empirical, statistical approach and found
that limiting warming to 1.5°C instead of 2°C would save 1.5-2.0%
of the gross world product (GWP) by mid-century and 3.5% of the
GWP by end-of-century (see Figure 2A in M. Burke et al., 2018).
Based on a 3% discount rate, this corresponds to 8.1-11.6 trillion
USD and 38.5 trillion USD in avoided damages by mid- and end-of-
century, respectively, agreeing closely with the estimate by Warren et
al. (2018c) of 15 trillion USD. Under the no-policy baseline scenario,
temperature rises by 3.66°C by 2100, resulting in a global gross
domestic product (GDP) loss of 2.6% (5-95% percentile range 0.5—
8.2%), compared with 0.3% (0.1-0.5%) by 2100 under the 1.5°C

to 1.5°C rather than 2°C by 2060 has also been estimated to result
in co-benefits of 0.5-0.6% of the world GDP, owing to reductions in
air pollution (Shindell et al, 2018), which is similar to the avoided

"between 1.6°C and 2.6°C above pre-industrial levels. Cross-Chapter
Box 6 in this chapter highlights that at 2°C of warming, new literature
shows that risks of food shortage are projected to emerge in the African
Sahel, the Mediterranean, central Europe, the Amazon, and western and
southern Africa, and that these are much larger than the corresponding
risks at 1.5°C. This suggests a transition from moderate to high risk of
regionally differentiated impacts between 1.5°C and 2°C above pre-
industrial levels for food security (medium confidence) (Figure 3.20).
Reduction in the availability of water resources at 2°C is projected to
be greater than 1.5°C of global warming, although changes in socio-
economics could have a greater influence (Section 3.4.2), with larger
risks in the Mediterranean (Box 3.2); estimates of the magnitude of the
risks remain similar to those cited in ARS. Globally, millions of people
may be at risk from sea level rise (SLR) during the 21st century (Hinkel
et al, 2014; Hauer et al., 2016), particularly if adaptation is limited. At
2°C of warming, more than 90% of global coastlines are projected to
experience SLR greater than 0.2 m, suggesting regional differences in
the risks of coastal flooding. Regionally differentiated multi-sector risks
are already apparent at 1.5°C of warming, being more prevalent where
vulnerable people live, predominantly in South Asia (mostly Pakistan,
India and China), but these risks are projected to spread to sub-Saharan
Africa, the Middle East and East Asia as temperature rises, with the
world’s poorest people disproportionately impacted at 2°C of warming
(Byers et al, 2018). The hydrological impacts of climate change in
Europe are projected to increase in spatial extent and intensity across
increasing global warming levels of 1.5°C, 2°C and 3°C (Donnelly et
al., 2017). Taken together, a transition from moderate to high risk is
now located between 1.5°C and 2°C above pre-industrial levels, based
on the assessment of risks to food security, water resources, drought,
heat exposure and coastal submergence (high confidence; Figure 3.21).

AMOC to anthropogenic warming (Caesar et al., 2018). It is very likely
that the AMOC will weaken over the 21st century. Best estimates and
ranges for the reduction based on CMIP5 simulations are 11% (1-24%)

that the frequency of extreme El Nifio events increases linearly with the

double (one event every ten years) under 1.5°C of global warming (G.
Wang et al. 2017). This pattern is projected to persist for a century after

Antarctic ice sheet and marine ice sheet instability (MISI) is estimated
to lie be between 1.5°C and 2°C. The time scale for eventual loss of the
ice sheets varies between millennia and tens of millennia and assumes
constant surface temperature forcing during this period. If temperature
were to decline subsequently the ice sheets might regrow, although
the amount of cooling required is likely to be highly dependent on the
duration and rate of the previous retreat. The magnitude of global sea
level rise that could occur over the next two centuries under 1.5°C-2°C
of global warming is estimated to be in the order of several tenths of a

associated with sea level rise by as much as 1-2 m over a period of

"This section reviews recent literature that has estimated the economic
benefits of constraining global warming to 1.5°C compared to 2°C.
The focus here is on evidence pertaining to specific regions, rather
than on global aggregated benefits (Section 3.5.2.4). At 2°C of global
warming, lower economic growth is projected for many countries than
at 1.5°C of global warming, with low-income countries projected to
experience the greatest losses (low to medium confidence) (M. Burke
et al., 2018; Pretis et al. 2018).A critical issue for developing countries
in particular is that advantages in some sectors are projected to be
offset by increasing mitigation costs (Rogelj et al., 2013; M. Burke et
al., 2018), with food production being a key factor. That is, although
restraining the global temperature increase to 2°C is projected to
reduce crop losses under climate change relative to higher levels of
warming, the associated mitigation costs may increase the risk of
hunger in low-income countries (low confidence) (Hasegawa et al.,
2016). It is likely that the even more stringent mitigation measures
required to restrict global warming to 1.5°C (Rogelj et al., 2013) will
further increase these mitigation costs and impacts. International
trade in food might be a key response measure for alleviating hunger
in developing countries under 1.5°C and 2°C stabilization scenarios

"Ice-free Arctic Ocean summers are very likely at levels of global
warming higher than 2°C (Notz and Stroeve, 2016; Rosenblum and
Eisenman, 2016; Screen and Williamson, 2017; Niederdrenk and
Notz, 2018). Some studies even indicate that the entire Arctic Ocean
summer period will become ice free under 2°C of global warming,
whilst others more conservatively estimate this probability to be in the
order of 50% (Section 3.3.8; Sanderson et al., 2017). The probability
of an ice-free Arctic in September at 1.5°C of global warming is low
and substantially lower than for the case of 2°C of global warming
(high confidence) (Section 3.3.8; Screen and Williamson, 2017; Jahn,

study that questions the validity of the 1.5°C threshold in terms of
maintaining summer Arctic Ocean sea ice (Niederdrenk and Notz,

winter for either 1.5°C or 2°C of global warming (medium confidence)

There is high agreement and robust evidence that photosynthetic

"Alpine regions are generally regarded as climate change hotspots
given that rich biodiversity has evolved in their cold and harsh climate,
but with many species consequently being vulnerable to increases in
temperature. Under regional warming, alpine species have been found
to migrate upwards on mountain slopes (Reasoner and Tinner, 2009),
an adaptation response that is obviously limited by mountain height
and habitability. Moreover, many of the world’s alpine regions are
important from a water security perspective through associated glacier
melt, snow melt and river flow (see Section 3.3.5.2 for a discussion of
these aspects). Projected biome shifts are /ikely to be severe in alpine
regions already at 1.5°C of warming and to increase further at 2°C
(Gerten et al., 2013, Figure 1b; B. Chen et al., 2014).

"In some Arctic land regions, the warming of cold extremes and the
increase in annual minimum temperature at 1.5°C are stronger than
the global mean temperature increase by a factor of two to three,
meaning 3°C—4.5°C of regional warming at 1.5°C of global warming
(e.g., northern Europe in Supplementary Material 3.SM, Figure 3.SM.5
see also Section 3.3.2.2 and Seneviratne et al., 2016). Moreover, over
much of the Arctic, a further increase of 0.5°C in the global surface
temperature, from 1.5°C to 2°C, may lead to further temperature
increases of 2°C—2.5°C (Figure 3.3). As a consequence, biome (major
ecosystem type) shifts are /ikely in the Arctic, with increases in fire
frequency, degradation of permafrost, and tree cover likely to occur at
1.5°C of warming and further amplification of these changes expected
under 2°C of global warming (e.g., Gerten et al., 2013; Bring et al.,
2016). Rising temperatures, thawing permafrost and changing weather
patterns are projected to increasingly impact people, infrastructure and
industries in the Arctic (W.N. Meier et al, 2014) with these impacts
larger at 2°C than at 1.5°C of warming (medium confidence).

"Southeast Asia is a region highly vulnerable to increased flooding in
the context of sea level rise (Arnell et al., 2016; Brown et al., 2016,
2018a). Risks from increased flooding are projected to rise from 1.5°C
to 2°C of warming (medium confidence), with substantial increases
projected beyond 2°C (Arnell et al, 2016). Southeast Asia displays
statistically significant differences in projected changes in heavy
precipitation, runoff and high flows at 1.5°C versus 2°C of warming,
with stronger increases occurring at 2°C (Section 3.3.3; Wartenburger
et al. 2017; Doll et al, 2018; Seneviratne et al., 2018c); thus, this region
is considered a hotspot in terms of increases in heavy precipitation
between these two global temperature levels (medium confidence)
(Schleussner et al., 201 6b; Seneviratne et al., 2016). For Southeast Asia,
2°C of warming by 2040 could lead to a decline by one-third in per
capita crop production associated with general decreases in crop yields
(Nelson et al., 2010). However, under 1.5°C of warming, significant
risks for crop yield reduction in the region are avoided (Schleussner et
al., 2016b). These changes pose significant risks for poor people in both
rural regions and urban areas of Southeast Asia (Section 3.4.10.1), with
these risks being larger at 2°C of global warming compared to 1.5°C
(medium confidence).

"The Mediterranean is regarded as a climate change hotspot, both in
terms of projected stronger warming of the regional land-based hot
extremes compared to the mean global temperature increase (e.g.,
Seneviratne et al., 2016) and in terms of of robust increases in the
probability of occurrence of extreme droughts at 2°C vs 1.5°C global
warming (Section 3.3.4). Low river flows are projected to decrease in
the Mediterranean under 1.5°C of global warming (Marx et al., 2018),
with associated significant decreases in high flows and floods (Thober
et al, 2018), largely in response to reduced precipitation. The median
reduction in annual runoff is projected to almost double from about
9% (likely range 4.5-15.5%) at 1.5°C to 17% (likely range 8-25%)
at 2°C (Schleussner et al., 2016b). Similar results were found by Doll
et al. (2018). Overall, there is high confidence that strong increases in
dryness and decreases in water availability in the Mediterranean and
southern Europe would occur from 1.5°C to 2°C of global warming. Sea
level rise is expected to be lower for 1.5°C versus 2°C, lowering risks
for coastal metropolitan agglomerations. The risks (assuming current
adaptation) related to water deficit in the Mediterranean are high for
global warming of 2°C but could be substantially reduced if global
warming were limited to 1.5°C (Section 3.3.4; Guiot and Cramer, 2016;

"West Africa and the Sahel are likely to experience increases in the
number of hot nights and longer and more frequent heatwaves
even if the global temperature increase is constrained to 1.5°C, with
further increases expected at 2°C of global warming and beyond
(e.g., Weber et al., 2018). Moreover, daily rainfall intensity and runoff
is expected to increase (low confidence) towards 2°C and higher
levels of global warming (Schleussner et al., 2016b; Weber et al.,
2018), with these changes also being relatively large compared to
the projected changes at 1.5°C of warming. Moreover, increased risks
are projected in terms of drought, particularly for the pre-monsoon
season (Sylla et al., 2015), with both rural and urban populations
affected, and more so at 2°C of global warming as opposed to 1.5°C
(Liu et al., 2018). Based on aWorld Bank (2013) study for sub-Saharan
Africa, a 1.5°C warming by 2030 might reduce the present maize
cropping areas by 40%, rendering these areas no longer suitable
for current cultivars. Substantial negative impacts are also projected
for sorghum suitability in the western Sahel (Laderach et al., 2013;
Sultan and Gaetani, 2016). An increase in warming to 2°C by 2040
would result in further yield losses and damages to crops (i.e., maize,
sorghum, wheat, millet, groundnut and cassava). Schleussner et al.
(2016b) found consistently reduced impacts on crop yield for West
Africa under 2°C compared to 1.5°C of global warming. There is
medium confidence that vulnerabilities to water and food security in
the African Sahel will be higher at 2°C compared to 1.5°C of global
warming (Cheung et al., 2016a; Betts et al, 2018), and at 2°C these
vulnerabilities are expected to be worse (high evidence) (Sultan and
Gaetani, 2016; Lehner et al., 2017; Betts et al., 2018; Byers et al.,
2018; Rosenzweig et al., 2018). Under global warming of more than
2°C, the western Sahel might experience the strongest drying and
experience serious food security issues (Ahmed et al., 2015; Parkes
et al., 2018).

"The southern African region is projected to be a climate change hotspot
in terms of both hot extremes (Figures 3.5 and 3.6) and drying (Figure
3.12). Indeed, temperatures have been rising in the subtropical regions
of southern Africa at approximately twice the global rate over the last
five decades (Engelbrecht et al., 2015). Associated elevated warming
of the regional land-based hot extremes has occurred (Section 3.3;
Seneviratne et al., 2016). Increases in the number of hot nights, as
well as longer and more frequent heatwaves, are projected even if the
global temperature increase is constrained to 1.5°C (high confidence),
with further increases expected at 2°C of global warming and beyond

"Worldwide, the largest increases in the number of hot days are
projected to occur in the tropics (Figure 3.7). Moreover, the largest
differences in the number of hot days for 1.5°C versus 2°C of global
warming are projected to occur in the tropics (Mahlstein et al, 2011).
In tropical Africa, increases in the number of hot nights, as well as
longer and more frequent heatwaves, are projected under 1.5°C of
global warming, with further increases expected under 2°C of global
warming (Weber et al., 2018). Impact studies for major tropical cereals
reveal that yields of maize and wheat begin to decline with 1°C to 2°C
of local warming in the tropics. Schleussner et al. (2016b) project that
constraining warming to 1.5°C rather than 2°C would avoid significant
risks of tropical crop yield declines in West Africa, Southeast Asia, and
Central and South America. There is limited evidence and thus low
confidence that these changes may result in significant population
displacement from the tropics to the subtropics (e.g., Hsiang and Sobel,
2016).

"The Fynbos and succulent Karoo biomes of South Africa are
threatened systems that were assessed in ARS. Similar shrublands
exist in the semi-arid regions of other continents, with the Sonora-
Mojave creosotebush-white bursage desert scrub ecosystem in the
USA being a prime example. Impacts accrue across these systems
with greater warming, with impacts at 2°C likely to be greater than
those at 1.5°C (medium confidence). Under 2°C of global warming,
regional warming in drylands is projected to be 3.2°C—-4°C, and under
1.5°C of global warming, mean warming in drylands is projected to
still be about 3°C. The Fynbos biome in southwestern South Africa
is vulnerable to the increasing impact of fires under increasing
temperatures and drier winters (high confidence). The Fynbos biome
is projected to lose about 20%, 45% and 80% of its current suitable
climate area relative to its present-day area under 1°C, 2°C and
3°C of warming, respectively (Engelbrecht and Engelbrecht, 2016),
demonstrating the value of climate change mitigation in protecting
this rich centre of biodiversity.

"Moreover, southern Africa is likely to generally become drier with
reduced water availability under low mitigation (Niang et al., 2014;
Engelbrecht et al., 2015; Karl et al., 2015; James et al., 2017), with
this particular risk being prominent under 2°C of global warming and
even under 1.5°C (Gerten et al., 2013). Risks are significantly reduced,
however, under 1.5°C of global warming compared to under higher
levels (Schleussner et al., 2016b). There are consistent and statistically
significant increases in projected risks of increased meteorological
drought in southern Africa at 2°C versus 1.5°C of warming (medium
confidence). Despite the general rainfall reductions projected for
southern Africa, daily rainfall intensities are expected to increase over
much of the region (medium confidence), and increasingly so with
higher levels of global warming. There is medium confidence that
livestock in southern Africa will experience increased water stress
under both 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming, with negative economic
consequences (e.g., Boone et al., 2018). The region is also projected
to experience reduced maize, sorghum and cocoa cropping area
suitability, as well as yield losses under 1.5°C of warming, with further
decreases occurring towards 2°C of warming (World Bank, 2013).
Generally, there is high confidence that vulnerability to decreases in
water and food availability is reduced at 1.5°C versus 2°C for southern
Africa (Betts et al., 2018), whilst at 2°C these are expected to be higher
(high confidence) (Lehner et al., 2017; Betts et al 2018; Byers et al.,

"It is widely recognized that small islands are very sensitive to climate
change impacts such as sea level rise, oceanic warming, heavy
precipitation, cyclones and coral bleaching (high confidence) (Nurse et
al., 2014; Ourbak and Magnan, 2017). Even at 1.5°C of global warming,
the compounding impacts of changes in rainfall, temperature, tropical
cyclones and sea level are likely to be significant across multiple
natural and human systems. There are potential benefits to small
island developing states (SIDS) from avoided risks at 1.5°C versus
2°C, especially when coupled with adaptation efforts. In terms of sea
level rise, by 2150, roughly 60,000 fewer people living in SIDS will be
exposed in a 1.5°C world than in a 2°C world (Rasmussen et al., 2018).
Constraining global warming to 1.5°C may significantly reduce water
stress (by about 25%) compared to the projected water stress at 2°C,
for example in the Caribbean region (Karnauskas et al., 2018), and may
enhance the ability of SIDS to adapt (Benjamin and Thomas, 2016). Up
to 50% of the year is projected to be very warm in the Caribbean at
1.5°C, with a further increase by up to 70 days at 2°C versus 1.5°C
(Taylor et al., 2018). By limiting warming to 1.5°C instead of 2°C in
2050, risks of coastal flooding (measured as the flood amplification
factors for 100-year flood events) are reduced by 20-80% for SIDS
(Rasmussen et al., 2018). A case study of Jamaica with lessons for
other Caribbean SIDS demonstrated that the difference between 1.5°C
and 2°C is likely to challenge livestock thermoregulation, resulting in
persistent heat stress for livestock (Lallo et al., 2018).

whether a bifurcation exists that would lead to the irreversible loss

al., 2012) and to test whether the summer sea ice extent can recover
after it has been lost (Schroder and Connolley, 2007; Sedlagek et al.,
2011; Tietsche et al., 2011). These studies did not find evidence of
bifurcation or indicate that sea ice returns within a few years of its loss,
leading Collins et al. (2013) to conclude that there is little evidence
for a tipping point in the transition from perennial to seasonal ice
cover. No evidence has been found for irreversibility or tipping points,
suggesting that year-round sea ice will return given a suitable climate

"Tree growth in tundra-dominated landscapes is strongly constrained by
the number of days with mean air temperature above 0°C. A potential
tipping point exists where the number of days below 0°C decreases
to the extent that the tree fraction increases significantly. Tundra-
dominated landscapes have warmed more than the global average
over the last century (Settele et al., 2014), with associated increases
in fires and permafrost degradation (Bring et al., 2016; DeBeer et al.,
2016; Jiang et al., 2016; Yang et al, 2016). These processes facilitate
conditions for woody species establishment in tundra areas, and for
the eventual transition of the tundra to boreal forest. The number of
investigations into how the tree fraction may respond in the Arctic to
different degrees of global warming is limited, and studies generally
indicate that substantial increases will likely occur gradually (eg.,
Lenton et al, 2008). Abrupt changes are only plausible at levels of
warming significantly higher than 2°C (low confidence) and would
occur in conjunction with a collapse in permafrost (Drijfhout et al.,

"Tipping points refer to critical thresholds in a system that, when exceeded,
can lead to a significant change in the state of the system, often with an
understanding that the change is irreversible. An understanding of the
sensitivities of tipping points in the physical climate system, as well as in
ecosystems and human systems, is essential for understanding the risks
associated with different degrees of global warming. This subsection
reviews tipping points across these three areas within the context
of the different sensitivities to 1.5°C versus 2°C of global warming.
Sensitivities to less ambitious global temperature goals are also briefly
reviewed. Moreover, an analysis is provided of how integrated risks
across physical, natural and human systems may accumulate to lead
to the exceedance of thresholds for particular systems. The emphasis in
this section is on the identification of regional tipping points and their
sensitivity to 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming, whereas tipping points
in the global climate system, referred to as large-scale singular events,
were already discussed in Section 3.5.2. A summary of regional tipping

"Widespread thawing of permafrost potentially makes a large carbon
store (estimated to be twice the size of the atmospheric store; Dolman
et al, 2010) vulnerable to decomposition, which could lead to further
increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane and hence to
further global warming. This feedback loop between warming and the
release of greenhouse gas from thawing tundra represents a potential
tipping point. However, the carbon released to the atmosphere from
thawing permafrost is projected to be restricted to 0.09-0.19 Gt C yr""
at 2°C of global warming and to 0.08-0.16 Gt C yr"" at 1.5°C (E.J.
Burke et al. 2018), which does not indicate a tipping point (medium
confidence). At higher degrees of global warming, in the order of
3°C, a different type of tipping point in permafrost may be reached.
A single model projection (Drijfhout et al., 2015) suggested that
higher temperatures may induce a smaller ice fraction in soils in the
tundra, leading to more rapidly warming soils and a positive feedback
mechanism that results in permafrost collapse (low confidence). The
disparity between the multi-millennial time scales of soil carbon
accumulation and potentially rapid decomposition in a warming
climate implies that the loss of this carbon to the atmosphere would
be essentially irreversible (Collins et al., 2013).

"Ata fundamental level, the pressure gradient between the Indian Ocean
and Asian continent determines the strength of the Asian monsoon. As
land masses warm faster than the oceans, a general strengthening of
this gradient, and hence of monsoons, may be expected under global
warming (e.g., Lenton et al., 2008). Additional factors such as changes
in albedo induced by aerosols and snow-cover change may also affect
temperature gradients and consequently pressure gradients and the
strength of the monsoon. In fact, it has been estimated that an increase
of the regional land mass albedo to 0.5 over India would represent a
tipping point resulting in the collapse of the monsoon system (Lenton
et al, 2008). The overall impacts of the various types of radiative
forcing under different emissions scenarios are more subtle, with a
weakening of the monsoon north of about 25°N in East Asia but a
strengthening south of this latitude projected by Jiang and Tian (2013)
under high and modest emissions scenarios. Increases in the intensity
of monsoon precipitation are /ikely under low mitigation (AR5). Given
that scenarios of 1.5°C or 2°C of global warming would include a
substantially smaller radiative forcing than those assessed in the study
by Jiang and Tian (2013), there is low confidence regarding changes in
monsoons at these low global warming levels, as well as regarding the
differences between responses at 1.5°C versus 2°C of warming.

"The potential impacts of climate change on livestock (Section 3.4.6),
in particular the direct impacts through increased heat stress, have
been less well studied than impacts on crop yield, especially from
the perspective of critical thresholds being exceeded. A case study
from Jamaica revealed that the difference in heat stress for livestock
between 1.5°C and 2°C of warming is likely to exceed the limits for
normal thermoregulation and result in persistent heat stress for these
animals (Lallo et al., 2018). It is plausible that this finding holds for
livestock production in both tropical and subtropical regions more
generally (medium confidence) (Section 3.4.6). Under 3°C of global
warming, significant reductions in the areas suitable for livestock
production could occur (low confidence), owing to strong increases in
regional temperatures in the tropics and subtropics (high confidence).
Thus, regional tipping points in the viability of livestock production may
well exist, but little evidence quantifying such changes exists.

"Boreal forests are likely to experience stronger local warming than the
global average (WGII AR5; Collins et al, 2013). Increased disturbance
from fire, pests and heat-related mortality may affect, in particular, the
southern boundary of boreal forests (medium confidence) (Gauthier
et al., 2015), with these impacts accruing with greater warming and
thus impacts at 2°C would be expected to be greater than those at
1.5°C (medium confidence). A tipping point for significant dieback of
the boreal forests is thought to exist, where increased tree mortality
would result in the creation of large regions of open woodlands
and grasslands, which would favour further regional warming and
increased fire frequencies, thus inducing a powerful positive feedback
mechanism (Lenton et al., 2008; Lenton, 2012). This tipping point has
been estimated to exist between 3°C and 4°C of global warming
(low confidence) (Lucht et al., 2006; Kriegler et al., 2009), but given
the complexities of the various forcing mechanisms and feedback
processes involved, this is thought to be an uncertain estimate.

"A large portion of rainfall over the world’s largest rainforests is
recirculated (e.g., Lenton et al., 2008), which raises the concern that
deforestation may trigger a threshold in reduced forest cover, leading
to pronounced forest dieback. For the Amazon, this deforestation
threshold has been estimated to be 40% (Nobre et al., 2016). Global
warming of 3°C—4°C may also, independent of deforestation, represent
a tipping point that results in a significant dieback of the Amazon
forest, with a key forcing mechanism being stronger El Nifio events
bringing more frequent droughts to the region (Nobre et al. 2016).
Increased fire frequencies under global warming may interact with and
accelerate deforestation, particularly during periods of El Nifio-induced
droughts (Lenton et al., 2008; Nobre et al., 2016). Global warming of
3°C is projected to reduce the extent of tropical rainforest in Central
America, with biomass being reduced by about 40%, which can lead
to a large replacement of rainforest by savanna and grassland (Lyra et
al., 2017). Overall, modelling studies (Huntingford et al., 2013; Nobre
et al., 2016) and observational constraints (Cox et al, 2013) suggest
that pronounced rainforest dieback may only be triggered at 3°C—4°C
(medium confidence), although pronounced biomass losses may occur
at 1.5°C— 2°C of global warming.

"The economic damages of climate change in the USA are projected to be large (Hsiang et al., 2017; Yohe, 2017). Hsiang et al. (2017)
shows that the USA stand to lose -0.1 to 1.7% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at 1.5°C warming. Yohe (2017) calculated transient
temperature trajectories from a linear relationship with contemporaneous cumulative emissions under a median no-policy baseline
trajectory that brings global emissions to roughly 93 GtCO, yr"" by the end of the century (Fawcett et al., 2015), with 1.75°C per 1000
GtCO, as the median estimate. Associated aggregate economic damages in decadal increments through the year 2100 are estimated
in terms of the percentage loss of GDP at the median, 5th percentile and 95th percentile transient temperature (Hsiang et al, 2017).
The results for the baseline no-policy case indicate that economic damages along median temperature change and median damages
(median-median) reach 4.5% of GDP by 2100, with an uncertainty range of 2.5% and 8.5% resulting from different combinations of
temperature change and damages. Avoided damages from achieving a 1.5°C temperature limit along the median-median case are
nearly 4% (range 2-7%) by 2100. Avoided damages from achieving a 2°C temperature limit are only 3.5% (range 1.8-6.5%). Avoided
damages from achieving 1.5°C versus 2°C are modest at about 0.35% (range 0.20-0.65%) by 2100. The values of achieving the two
temperature limits do not diverge significantly until 2040, when their difference tracks between 0.05 and 0.13%; the differences

"use of CDR to further limit warming to 1.7°C would result in the
conversion of 1.1-1.5 Gha of land — implying enormous losses of both
cropland and natural ecosystems. Newbold et al. (2015) found that
biodiversity loss in the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)2.6
scenario could be greater than that in RCP4.5 and RCP6, in which there
is more climate change but less land-use change. Risks to biodiversity
conservation and agricultural production are therefore projected to
result from large-scale bioenergy deployment pathways (P. Smith et
al., 2013; Tavoni and Socolow, 2013). One study explored an extreme
mitigation strategy encouraging biofuel expansion sufficient to limit
warming to 1.5°C and found that this would be more disruptive to land
use and crop prices than the impacts of a 2°C warmer world which
has a larger climate signal and lower mitigation requirement (Ruane
et al., 2018). However, it should again be emphasized that many of the
pathways explored in Chapter 2 of this report follow strategies that
explore how to reduce these issues. Chapter 4 provides an assessment

"Irrespective of any mitigation-related issues, in order for ecosystems
to adapt to climate change, land use would also need to be carefully
managed to allow biodiversity to disperse to areas that become
newly climatically suitable for it (Section 3.4.1) and to protect the
areas where the future climate will still remain suitable. This implies
a need for considerable expansion of the protected area network
(Warren et al, 2018b), either to protect existing natural habitat or
to restore it (perhaps through reforestation, see above). At the same
time, adaptation to climate change in the agricultural sector (Rippke
et al, 2016) can require transformational as well as new approaches
to land-use management; in order to meet the rising food demand
of a growing human population, it is projected that additional
land will need to be brought into production unless there are large
increases in agricultural productivity (Tilman et al., 2011). However,
future rates of deforestation may be underestimated in the existing
literature (Mahowald et al., 2017a), and reforestation may therefore
be associated with significant co-benefits if implemented to restore
natural ecosystems (high confidence).

"management used. However, not all of the land footprint of CDR is
necessarily to be in competition with biodiversity protection. Where
reforestation is the restoration of natural ecosystems, it benefits both
carbon sequestration and conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem
services (Section 4.3.7) and can contribute to the achievement of
the Aichi targets under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)
(Leadley et al, 2016). However, reforestation is often not defined in
this way (Section 4.3.8; Stanturf et al, 2014) and the ability to deliver
biodiversity benefits is strongly dependent on the precise nature
of the reforestation, which has different interpretations in different
contexts and can often include agroforestry rather than restoration
of pristine ecosystems (Pistorious and Kiff, 2017). However, ‘natural
climate solutions’, defined as conservation, restoration, and improved
land management actions that increase carbon storage and/or avoid
greenhouse gas emissions across global forests, wetlands, grasslands
and agricultural lands, are estimated to have the potential to provide
37% of the cost-effective CO, mitigation needed by southern Europe

"The magnitude of the biophysical impacts is potentially large for
temperature extremes. Indeed, changes induced both by modifications
in moisture availability and irrigation and by changes in surface albedo
tend to be larger (i.e., stronger cooling) for hot extremes than for mean
temperatures (e.g., Seneviratne et al, 2013; Davin et al. 2014; Wilhelm
et al, 2015; Hirsch et al., 2017; Thiery et al., 2017). The reasons for
reduced moisture availability are related to a strong contribution of
moisture deficits to the occurrence of hot extremes in mid-latitude
regions (Mueller and Seneviratne, 2012; Seneviratne et al, 2013). In
the case of surface albedo, cooling associated with higher albedo (e.g.,
in the case of no-till farming) is more effective at cooling hot days
because of the higher incoming solar radiation for these days (Davin
et al, 2014). The overall effect of either irrigation or albedo has been
found to be at the most in the order of about 1°C-2°C regionally for
temperature extremes. This can be particularly important in the context
of low-emissions scenarios because the overall effect is in this case
of similar magnitude to the response to the greenhouse gas forcing

"Greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes related to land use are reported in the ‘agriculture, forestry and other land use’ sector (AFOLU) and
comprise about 25% (about 10-12 GtCO,eq yr) of anthropogenic GHG emissions (P. Smith et al., 2014). Reducing emissions from
land use, as well as land-use change, are thus an important component of low-emissions mitigation pathways (Clarke et al, 2014),
particularly as land-use emissions can be influenced by human actions such as deforestation, afforestation, fertilization, irrigation,
harvesting, and other aspects of cropland, grazing land and livestock management (Paustian et al., 2006; Griscom et al., 2017;

Houghton and Nassikas, 2018).

"Atmospheric aerosols and gases can also modify the land and ocean
uptake of anthropogenic CO,; some compounds enhance uptake while
others reduce it (Section 2.6.2; Ciais et al., 2013). While CO, emissions
tend to encourage greater uptake of carbon by the land and the
ocean (Ciais et al., 2013), CHs emissions can enhance ozone pollution,
depending on nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds and other
organic species concentrations, and ozone pollution tends to reduce
land productivity (Myhre et al., 2013; B. Wang et al., 2017). Aside from
inhibiting land vegetation productivity, ozone may also alter the CO,,
CHa and nitrogen (N,O) exchange at the land—atmosphere interface
and transform the global soil system from a sink to a source of
carbon (B. Wang et al., 2017). Aerosols and associated nitrogen-based
compounds tend to enhance the uptake of CO, in land and ocean
systems through deposition of nutrients and modification of climate
(Ciais et al., 2013; Mahowald et al., 2017b).

"In the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, the vast majority of scenarios assessed with a 66% or better chance of limiting global warming
to 2°C by 2100 included carbon dioxide removal (CDR) — typically about 10 GtCO, yr in 2100 or about 200-400 GtCO, over
the course of the century (Smith et al., 2015; van Vuuren et al., 2016). These integrated assessment model (IAM) results were
predominately achieved by using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and/or afforestation and reforestation (AR).
Virtually all scenarios that limit either peak or end-of-century warming to 1.5°C also use land-intensive CDR technologies (Rogelj
et al., 2015; Holz et al, 2017; Kriegler et al, 2017; Fuss et al., 2018; van Vuuren et al., 2018). Again, AR (Sections 2.3 and 4.3.7)
and BECCS (Sections 4.3.2. and 4.3.7) predominate. Other CDR options, such as the application of biochar to soil, soil carbon
sequestration, and enhanced weathering (Section 4.3.7) are not yet widely incorporated into IAMs, but their deployment would also
necessitate the use of land and/or changes in land management.

"Evaluating the synergies and trade-offs between mitigation and adaptation actions, resulting land and climate impacts, and the
myriad issues related to land-use governance will be essential to better understand the future role of CDR technologies. This topic
will be addressed further in the IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) due to be published in 2019.
"	Text
"Afforestation and reforestation can also present trade-offs between biodiversity, carbon sequestration and water use, and these
strategies have a higher land footprint per tonne of CO, removed (Cunningham, 2015; Naudts et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2018).
For example, changing forest management to strategies favouring faster growing species, greater residue extraction and shorter
rotations may have a negative impact on biodiversity (de Jong et al., 2014). In contrast, reforestation of degraded land with native
trees can have substantial benefits for biodiversity (Section 3.6). Despite these constraints, the potential for increased carbon
sequestration through improved land stewardship measures is considered to be substantial (Griscom et al., 2017).
"	Text
"The impacts of changing land use are highly context, location and scale dependent (Robledo-Abad et al., 2017). The supply of
biomass for CDR (e.g., energy crops) has received particular attention. The literature identifies regional examples of where the use
of land to produce biofuels might be sustainably increased (Jaiswal et al., 2017), where biomass markets could contribute to the
provision of ecosystem services (Dale et al, 2017), and where bioenergy could increase the resilience of production systems and
contribute to rural development (Kline et al., 2017). However, studies of global biomass potential provide only limited insight into
the local feasibility of supplying large quantities of biomass on a global scale (Slade et al., 2014). Concerns about large-scale use
of biomass for CDR include a range of potential consequences including greatly increased demand for freshwater use, increased
competition for land, loss of biodiversity and/or impacts on food security (Section 3.6.2.1; Heck et al., 2018). The short- versus long-
term carbon impacts of substituting biomass for fossil fuels, which are largely determined by feedstock choice, also remain a source
of contention (Schulze et al., 2012; Jonker et al., 2014; Booth, 2018; Sterman et al., 2018).
"	Text
"Cross-Chapter Box 7 Table 1 presents a comparison of the five CDR options assessed in this report. This illustrates that if BECCS
and AR were to be deployed at a scale of 12 GtCO, yr‘ in 2100, for example, they would have a substantial land and water
footprint. Whether this footprint would result in adverse impacts, for example on biodiversity or food production, depends on the
existence and effectiveness of measures to conserve land carbon stocks, limit the expansion of agriculture at the expense of natural
ecosystems, and increase agriculture productivity (Bonsch et al., 2016; Obersteiner et al., 2016; Bertram et al., 2018; Humpendder et
al., 2018). In comparison, the land and water footprints of enhanced weathering, soil carbon sequestration and biochar application
are expected to be far less per GtCO, sequestered. These options may offer potential co-benefits by providing an additional source of
nutrients or by reducing N,O emissions, but they are also associated with potential side effects. Enhanced weathering would require
massive mining activity, and providing feedstock for biochar would require additional land, even though a proportion of the required
biomass is expected to come from residues (Woolf et al., 2010; Smith, 2016). For the terrestrial CDR options, permanence and
saturation are important considerations, making their viability and long-term contributions to carbon reduction targets uncertain.
"	Text
"The technical, political and social feasibility of scaling up and implementing land-intensive CDR technologies (Cross-Chapter Box 3
in Chapter 1) is recognized to present considerable potential barriers to future deployment (Boucher et al., 2013a; Fuss et al., 2014,
2018; Anderson and Peters, 2016; Vaughan and Gough, 2016; Williamson, 2016; Minx et al., 2017, 2018; Nemet et al., 2018; Strefler
et al., 2018; Vaughan et al., 2018). To investigate the implications of restricting CDR options should these barriers prove difficult to
overcome, IAM studies (Section 2.3.4) have developed scenarios that limit — either implicitly or explicitly — the use of BECCS and
bioenergy (Krey et al., 2014; Bauer et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018) or the use of BECCS and afforestation (Strefler et al., 2018).
Alternative strategies to limit future reliance on CDR have also been examined, including increased electrification, agricultural
intensification, behavioural change, and dramatic improvements in energy and material efficiency (Bauer et al., 2018; Grubler et
al., 2018; van Vuuren et al., 2018). Somewhat counterintuitively, scenarios that seek to limit the deployment of BECCs may result in
increased land use, through greater deployment of bioenergy, and afforestation (Chapter 2, Box 2.1; Krey et al., 2014; Krause et al.,
2017; Bauer et al, 2018; Rogelj et al, 2018). Scenarios aiming to minimize the total human land footprint (including land for food,
energy and climate mitigation) also result in land-use change, for example by increasing agricultural efficiency and dietary change
(Grubler et al., 2018).

"Church et al. (2013) noted that the collapse of marine sectors of the
Antarctic ice sheet could lead to a global mean sea level (GMSL) rise
above the likely range, and that there was medium confidence that this
additional contribution ‘would not exceed several tenths of a metre
during the 21st century’.
"	Text
"In summary, there is medium confidence that a threshold in the long-
term GMSL contribution of both the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets
lies around 1.5°C to 2°C of global warming relative to pre-industrial;
however, the GMSL associated with these two levels of global warming
cannot be differentiated on the basis of the existing literature.

"The multi-centennial evolution of the Antarctic ice sheet has been
considered in papers by DeConto and Pollard (2016) and Golledge et
al. (2015). Both suggest that RCP2.6 is the only RCP scenario leading
to long-term contributions to GMSL of less than 1.0 m. The long-term
committed future of Antarctica and the GMSL contribution at 2100
are complex and require further detailed process-based modelling;
however, a threshold in this contribution may be located close to 1.5°C
to 2°C of global warming.

"Based on the sensitivities summarized by Levermann et al. (2013), the
contributions of thermal expansion (0.20-0.63 m °C"") and glaciers
(0.21 m °C"" but falling at higher degrees of warming mostly because
of the depletion of glacier mass, with a possible total loss of about
0.6 m) amount to 0.5-1.2 m and 0.6-1.7 m in 1.5°C and 2°C warmer
worlds, respectively. The bulk of SLR on greater than centennial time
scales will therefore be caused by contributions from the continental
ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica, whose existence is threatened
on multi-millennial time scales.

"The Antarctic ice sheet, in contrast, loses the mass gained by snowfall
as outflow and subsequent melt to the ocean, either directly from the
underside of floating ice shelves or indirectly by the melting of calved
icebergs. The long-term existence of this ice sheet will also be affected
by a potential instability (the marine ice sheet instability, MISI), which
links outflow (or mass loss) from the ice sheet to water depth at the
grounding line (i.e., the point at which grounded ice starts to float and
becomes an ice shelf) so that retreat into deeper water (the bedrock
underlying much of Antarctica slopes downwards towards the centre
of the ice sheet) leads to further increases in outflow and promotes
"	Text
"yet further retreat (Schoof, 2007). More recently, a variant on this
mechanism was postulated in which an ice cliff forms at the grounding
line and retreats rapidly though fracture and iceberg calving (DeConto
and Pollard, 2016). There is a growing body of evidence (Golledge et
al., 2015; DeConto and Pollard, 2016) that large-scale retreat may be
avoided in emissions scenarios such as Representative Concentration
Pathway (RCP)2.6 but that higher-emissions RCP scenarios could lead
to the loss of the West Antarctic ice sheet and sectors in East Antarctica,
although the duration (centuries or millennia) and amount of mass loss
during such a collapse is highly dependent on model details and no
consensus exists yet. Schoof (2007) suggested that retreat may be
irreversible, although a rigorous test has yet to be made. In this context,
overshoot scenarios, especially of higher magnitude or longer duration,
could increase the risk of such irreversible retreat.

"Policy decisions related to anthropogenic climate change will have a
profound impact on sea level, not only for the remainder of this century
but for many millennia to come (Clark et al., 2016). On these long time
scales, 50 m of sea level rise (SLR) is possible (Clark et al., 2016). While it
is virtually certain that sea level will continue to rise well beyond 2100,
the amount of rise depends on future cumulative emissions (Church et
al., 2013) as well as their profile over time (Bouttes et al, 2013; Mengel
et al., 2018). Marzeion et al. (2018) found that 28-44% of present-day
glacier volume is unsustainable in the present-day climate and that it
would eventually melt over the course of a few centuries, even if there
were no further climate change. Some components of SLR, such as
thermal expansion, are only considered reversible on centennial time
scales (Bouttes et al., 2013; Zickfeld et al., 2013), while the contribution
from ice sheets may not be reversible under any plausible future
scenario (see below).
"	Text
"For Greenland, where melting from the ice sheet's surface is important,
a well-documented instability exists where the surface of a thinning
ice sheet encounters progressively warmer air temperatures that
further promote melting and thinning. A useful indicator associated
with this instability is the threshold at which annual mass loss from
the ice sheet by surface melt exceeds mass gain by snowfall. Previous
estimates put this threshold at about 1.9°C to 5.1°C above pre-
industrial temperatures (Gregory and Huybrechts, 2006). More recent
analyses, however, suggest that this threshold sits between 0.8°C
and 3.2°C, with a best estimate at 1.6°C (Robinson et al., 2012). The
continued decline of the ice sheet after this threshold has been passed
is highly dependent on the future climate and varies between about
80% loss after 10,000 years to complete loss after as little as 2000
years (contributing about 6 m to SLR). Church et al. (2013) were unable
to quantify a likely range for this threshold. They assigned medium
confidence to a range greater than 2°C but less than 4°C, and had
low confidence in a threshold of about 1°C. There is insufficient new
literature to change this assessment.

"The slow rate of permafrost thaw introduces a lag between the
transient degradation of near-surface permafrost and contemporary
climate, so that the equilibrium response is expected to be 25-38%
greater than the transient response simulated in climate models (Slater
and Lawrence, 2013). The long-term, equilibrium Arctic permafrost loss
to global warming was analysed by Chadburn et al. (2017). They used
an empirical relation between recent mean annual air temperatures
and the area underlain by permafrost coupled to Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) stabilization projections
to 2300 for RCP2.6 and RCP4.5. Their estimate of the sensitivity of
permafrost to warming is 2.9-5.0 million km? °C“ (1 standard deviation
confidence interval), which suggests that stabilizing climate at 1.5°C as
opposed to 2°C would reduce the area of eventual permafrost loss by
1.5 to 2.5 million km? (stabilizing at 56-83% as opposed to 43-72% of
1960-1990 levels). This work, combined with the assessment of Collins
et al. (2013) on the link between global warming and permafrost loss,
leads to the assessment that permafrost extent would be appreciably
greater in a 1.5°C warmer world compared to in a 2°C warmer world

"The Paris Agreement includes goals of stabilizing global mean surface temperature (GMST) well below 2°C and 1.5°C above pre-
industrial levels in the longer term. There are several aspects, however, that remain open regarding what a ‘1.5°C warmer world’
could be like, in terms of mitigation (Chapter 2) and adaptation (Chapter 4), as well as in terms of projected warming and associated
regional climate change (Chapter 3), which are overlaid on anticipated and differential vulnerabilities (Chapter 5). Alternative
“1.5°C warmer worlds’ resulting from mitigation and adaptation choices, as well as from climate variability (climate
‘noise’), can be vastly different, as highlighted in this Cross-Chapter Box. In addition, the range of models underlying 1.5°C
projections can be substantial and needs to be considered.

"single locations and at specific times! Global mean Surface temperature (GMS!) Corresponds to the globally averaged
temperature of Earth derived from point-scale ground observations or computed in climate models (Chapters 1 and 3). Global
mean surface temperature is additionally defined over a given time frame, for example averaged over a month, a year, or
multiple decades. Because of climate variability, a climate-based GMST typically needs to be defined over several decades
(typically 20 or 30 years; Chapter 3, Section 3.2). Hence, whether or when global warming reaches 1.5°C depends to some
extent on the choice of pre-industrial reference period, whether 1.5°C refers to total or human-induced warming, and which
variables and coverage are used to define GMST change (Chapter 1). By definition, because GMST is an average in time and
space, there will be locations and time periods in which 1.5°C of warming is exceeded, even if the global mean warming is at
1.5°C. In some locations, these differences can be particularly large (Cross-Chapter Box 8, Figure 1).

What is the impact of different climate models for projected changes in climate at 1.5°C of global warming?
The range between single model simulations of projected regional changes at 1.5°C GMST increase can be substantial for
regional responses (Chapter 3, Section 3.3). For instance, for the warming of cold extremes in a 1.5°C warmer world, some
model simulations project a 3°C warming while others project more than 6°C of warming in the Arctic land areas (Cross-
Chapter Box 8, Figure 2). For hot temperature extremes in the contiguous United States, the range of model simulations
includes temperatures lower than pre-industrial values (-0.3°C) and a warming of 3.5°C (Cross-Chapter Box 8, Figure 2). Some
regions display an even larger range (e.g., 1°C-6°C regional warming in hot extremes in central Europe at 1.5°C of warming;
Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.2). This large spread is due to both modelling uncertainty and internal climate variability.
While the range is large, it also highlights risks that can be avoided with near certainty in a 1.5°C warmer world compared
to worlds at higher levels of warming (e.g., an 8°C warming of cold extremes in the Arctic is not reached at 1.5°C of global
warming in the multimodel ensemble but could happen at 2°C of global warming; Cross-Chapter Box 8, Figure 2). Inferred
projected ranges of regional responses (mean value, minimum and maximum) for different mitigation scenarios from Chapter
2 are displayed in Cross-Chapter Box 8, Table 1.

What is the impact of emissions pathways with, versus without, an overshoot? All mitigation pathways projecting less
than 1.5°C of global warming over or at the end of the 21st century include some probability of overshooting 1.5°C. These
pathways include some periods with warming stronger than 1.5°C in the course of the coming decades and/or some probability
of not reaching 1.5°C (Chapter 2, Section 2.2). This is inherent to the difficulty of limiting global warming to 1.5°C, given that

important for the more slowly evolving parts of the Earth system, such as those associated with sea level rise. In addition, for
several types of risks the rate of change may be most relevant (Loarie et al., 2009; LoPresti et al., 2015), with potentially large
risks occurring in the case of a rapid rise to overshooting temperatures, even if a decrease to 1.5°C may be achieved at the end
of the 21st century or later. On the other hand, if overshoot is to be minimized, the remaining equivalent CO, budget available
for emissions has to be very small, which implies that large, immediate and unprecedented global efforts to mitigate GHGs are
required (Cross-Chapter Box 8, Table 1; Chapter 4).

What is the probability of reaching 1.5°C of global warming if emissions compatible with 1.5°C pathways are
followed? Emissions pathways in a ‘prospective scenario’ (see Chapter 1, Section 1.2.3, and Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1
on ‘Scenarios and pathways’) compatible with 1.5°C of global warming are determined based on their probability of reaching
1.5°C by 2100 (Chapter 2, Section 2.1), given current knowledge of the climate system response. These probabilities cannot
be quantified precisely but are typically 50-66% in 1.5°C-consistent pathways (Section 1.2.3). This implies a one-in-two to
one-in-three probability that global warming would exceed 1.5°C even under a 1.5°C-consistent pathway, including some
possibility that global warming would be substantially over this value (generally about 5-10% probability; see Cross-Chapter
Box 8, Table 1 and Seneviratne et al., 2018b). These alternative outcomes need to be factored into the decision-making process.
To address this issue, ‘adaptive’ mitigation scenarios have been proposed in which emissions are continually adjusted to
achieve a temperature goal (Millar et al., 2017). The set of dimensions involved in mitigation options (Chapter 4) is complex
and need system-wide approaches to be successful. Adaptive scenarios could be facilitated by the global stocktake mechanism
established in the Paris Agreement, and thereby transfer the risk of higher-than-expected warming to a risk of faster-than-
expected mitigation efforts. However, there are some limits to the feasibility of such approaches because some investments, for
example in infrastructure, are long term and also because the actual departure from an aimed pathway will need to be detected
against the backdrop of internal climate variability, typically over several decades (Haustein et al., 2017; Seneviratne et al.,
2018b). Avoiding impacts that depend on atmospheric composition as well as GMST (Baker et al., 2018) would also require
limits on atmospheric CO, concentrations in the event of a lower-than-expected GMST response.

of an overshoot and its associated peak warming and duration, how stabilization of the increase in global surface

al., 2018; van Vuuren et al. 2018). Taking into account the implementation of CDR, the CO,-induced warming by 2100 is
determined by the difference between the total amount of CO, generated (that can be reduced by early decarbonization) and
the total amount permanently stored out of the atmosphere, for example by geological sequestration (Chapter 4, Section 4.3.7).

What determines risks and opportunities in a 1.5°C warmer world? The risks to natural, managed and human systems in
a 1.5°C warmer world will depend not only on uncertainties in the regional climate that results from this level of warming, but
also very strongly on the methods that humanity uses to limit global warming to 1.5°C. This is particularly the case for natural
ecosystems and agriculture (see Cross-Chapter Box 7 in this chapter and Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2). The risks to human systems
will also depend on the magnitude and effectiveness of policies and measures implemented to increase resilience to the risks
of climate change and on development choices over coming decades, which will influence the underlying vulnerabilities and
capacities of communities and institutions for responding and adapting.

Which aspects are not considered, or only partly considered, in the mitigation scenarios from Chapter 2? These
include biophysical impacts of land use, water constraints on energy infrastructure, and regional implications of choices of
specific scenarios for tropospheric aerosol concentrations or the modulation of concentrations of short-lived climate forcers,
that is, greenhouse gases (Chapter 3, Section 3.6.3). Such aspects of development pathways need to be factored into
comprehensive assessments of the regional implications of mitigation and adaptation measures. On the other hand, some of
these aspects are assessed in Chapter 4 as possible options for mitigation and adaptation to a 1.5°C warmer world.

Are there commonalities to all alternative 1.5°C warmer worlds? Human-driven warming linked to CO, emissions is nearly
irreversible over time frames of 1000 years or more (Matthews and Caldeira, 2008; Solomon et al., 2009). The GSMT of the Earth
responds to the cumulative amount of CO, emissions. Hence, all 1.5°C stabilization scenarios require both net CO, emissions and
multi-gas CO,-forcing-equivalent emissions to be zero at some point (Chapter 2, Section 2.2). This is also the case for stabilization
scenarios at higher levels of warming (e.g., at 2°C); the only difference is the projected time at which the net CO, budget is zero.

Hence, a transition to decarbonization of energy use is necessary in all scenarios. It should be noted that all scenarios
of Chapter 2 include approaches for carbon dioxide removal (CDR) in order to achieve the net zero CO, emissions budget.
Most of these use carbon capture and storage (CCS) in addition to reforestation, although to varying degrees (Chapter

"In the 2020s, internal climate variability leads to higher warming than projected, in a reverse development to what
happened in the so-called ‘hiatus’ period of the 2000s. Temperatures are regularly above 1.5°C of warming, although
radiative forcing is consistent with a warming of 1.2°C or 1.3°C. Deadly heatwaves in major cities (Chicago, Kolkata, Beijing,
Karachi, Sao Paulo), droughts in southern Europe, southern Africa and the Amazon region, and major flooding in Asia, all
intensified by the global and regional warming (Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.3.4 and 3.4.8; Cross-Chapter
Box 11 in Chapter 4), lead to increasing levels of public unrest and political destabilization (Chapter 5, Section 5.2.1). An
emergency global summit in 2025 moves to much more ambitious climate targets. Costs for rapidly phasing out fossil fuel use and
infrastructure, while rapidly expanding renewables to reduce emissions, are much higher than in Scenario 1, owing to a failure to
support economic measures to drive the transition (Chapter 4). Disruptive technologies become crucial to face up to the adaptation
measures needed (Chapter 4, Section 4.4.4).

"There is strong participation in all major world regions at the national, state and/or city levels. Transport is strongly decarbonized
through a shift to electric vehicles, with more cars with electric than combustion engines being sold by 2025 (Chapter 2, Section
2.4.3; Chapter 4, Section 4.3.3). Several industry-sized plants for carbon capture and storage are installed and tested in the 2020s
(Chapter 2, Section 2.4.2; Chapter 4, Sections 4.3.4 and 4.3.7). Competition for land between bioenergy cropping, food production,
and biodiversity conservation is minimized by sourcing bioenergy for carbon capture and storage from agricultural wastes, algae
and kelp farms (Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3; Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2). Agriculture is intensified in countries with coordinated
planning associated with a drastic decrease in food waste (Chapter 2, Section 2.4.4; Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2). This leaves many
natural ecosystems relatively intact, supporting continued provision of most ecosystem services, although relocation of species
towards higher latitudes and elevations still results in changes in local biodiversity in many regions, particularly in mountain,
tropical, coastal and Arctic ecosystems (Chapter 3, Section 3.4.3). Adaptive measures such as the establishment of corridors for
the movement of species and parts of ecosystems become a central practice within conservation management (Chapter 3, Section
3.4.3; Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2). The movement of species presents new challenges for resource management as novel ecosystems,
as well as pests and disease, increase (Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 3). Crops are grown on marginal land, no-till agriculture is
deployed, and large areas are reforested with native trees (Chapter 2, Section 2.4.4; Chapter 3, Section 3.6.2; Cross-Chapter Box
7 in Chapter 3; Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2). Societal preference for healthy diets reduces meat consumption and associated GHG
emissions (Chapter 2, Section 2.4.4; Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2; Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 3).

By 2100, global mean temperature is on average 0.5°C warmer than it was in 2018 (Chapter 1, Section 1.2.1). Only a minor
temperature overshoot occurs during the century (Chapter 2, Section 2.2). In mid-latitudes, frequent hot summers and precipitation
events tend to be more intense (Chapter 3, Section 3.3). Coastal communities struggle with increased inundation associated
with rising sea levels and more frequent and intense heavy rainfall (Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.9; Chapter 4, Section
4.3.2; Chapter 5, Box 5.3 and Section 5.3.2; Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5), and some respond by moving, in many cases
with consequences for urban areas. In the tropics, in particular in megacities, there are frequent deadly heatwaves whose risks
are reduced by proactive adaptation (Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.1 and 3.4.8; Chapter 4, Section 4.3.8), overlaid on a suite of
development challenges and limits in disaster risk management (Chapter 4, Section 4.3.3; Chapter 5, Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2;
Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5). Glaciers extent decreases in most mountainous areas (Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.5 and 3.5.4).
Reduced Arctic sea ice opens up new shipping lanes and commercial corridors (Chapter 3, Section 3.3.8; Chapter 4, Box 4.3).
Small island developing states (SIDS), as well as coastal and low-lying areas, have faced significant changes but have largely
persisted in most regions (Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.9 and 3.5.4, Box 3.5). The Mediterranean area becomes drier (Chapter 3,
Section 3.3.4 and Box 3.2) and irrigation of crops expands, drawing the water table down in many areas (Chapter 3, Section
3.4.6). The Amazon is reasonably well preserved, through avoided risk of droughts (Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.4 and 3.4.3; Chapter
4, Box 4.3) and reduced deforestation (Chapter 2, Section 2.4.4; Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3; Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2), and
the forest services are working with the pattern observed at the beginning of the 21st century (Chapter 4, Box 4.3). While some
climate hazards become more frequent (Chapter 3, Section 3.3), timely adaptation measures help reduce the associated risks
for most, although poor and disadvantaged groups continue to experience high climate risks to their livelihoods and well-being
(Chapter 5, Section 5.3.1; Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5; Chapter 3, Boxes 3.4 and 3.5; Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 3).
Summer sea ice has not completely disappeared from the Arctic (Chapter 3, Section 3.4.4.7) and coral reefs, having been driven to
a low level (10-30% of levels in 2018), have partially recovered by 2100 after extensive dieback (Chapter 3, Section 3.4.4.10 and
Box 3.4). The Earth system, while warmer, is still recognizable compared to the 2000s, and no major tipping points are reached
(Chapter 3, Section 3.5.2.5). Crop yields remain relatively stable (Chapter 3, Section 3.4). Aggregate economic damage of climate
change impacts is relatively small, although there are some local losses associated with extreme weather events (Chapter 3,
Section 3.5; Chapter 4). Human well-being remains overall similar to that in 2020 (Chapter 5, Section 5.2.2).

extensive in some countries, reversing some achievements in sustainable development and human security (Chapter 5, Section

losses (Chapter 4, Sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3). The health and well-being of people generally decrease from 2020, while the levels of

"There are high levels of public unrest and political destabilization due to the increasing climatic pressures, resulting in some
countries becoming dysfunctional (Chapter 4, Sections 4.4.1 and 4.4.2). The main countries responsible for the CO, emissions
design rapidly conceived mitigation plans and try to install plants for carbon capture and storage, in some cases without sufficient
prior testing (Chapter 4, Section 4.3.6). Massive investments in renewable energy often happen too late and are uncoordinated;
energy prices soar as a result of the high demand and lack of infrastructure. In some cases, demand cannot be met, leading
to further delays. Some countries propose to consider sulphate-aerosol based Solar Radiation Modification (SRM) (Chapter 4,
Section 4.3.8); however, intensive international negotiations on the topic take substantial time and are inconclusive because of
overwhelming concerns about potential impacts on monsoon rainfall and risks in case of termination (Cross-Chapter Box 10 in

Radiative forcing increases and, due to chance, the most extreme events tend to happen in less populated regions and thus do not
increase global concerns. Nonetheless, there are more frequent heatwaves in several cities and less snow in mountain resorts in
the Alps, Rockies and Andes (Chapter 3, Section 3.3). Global warming of 1.5°C is reached by 2030 but no major changes in policies
occur. Starting with an intense El Nifio—La Nifia phase in the 2030s, several catastrophic years occur while global warming starts
to approach 2°C. There are major heatwaves on all continents, with deadly consequences in tropical regions and Asian megacities,
especially for those ill-equipped for protecting themselves and their communities from the effects of extreme temperatures
(Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.1, 3.3.2 and 3.4.8). Droughts occur in regions bordering the Mediterranean Sea, central North America,
the Amazon region and southern Australia, some of which are due to natural variability and others to enhanced greenhouse gas
forcing (Chapter 3, Section 3.3.4; Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2; Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4). Intense flooding occurs in high-
latitude and tropical regions, in particular in Asia, following increases in heavy precipitation events (Chapter 3, Section 3.3.3).
Major ecosystems (coral reefs, wetlands, forests) are destroyed over that period (Chapter 3, Section 3.4), with massive disruption
to local livelihoods (Chapter 5, Section 5.2.2 and Box 5.3; Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5). An unprecedented drought leads
to large impacts on the Amazon rainforest (Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.4 and 3.4), which is also affected by deforestation (Chapter 2).
A hurricane with intense rainfall and associated with high storm surges (Chapter 3, Section 3.3.6) destroys a large part of Miami.
A two-year drought in the Great Plains in the USA and a concomitant drought in eastern Europe and Russia decrease global crop
production (Chapter 3, Section 3.3.4), resulting in major increases in food prices and eroding food security. Poverty levels increase
toa very large scale, and the risk and incidence of starvation increase considerably as food stores dwindle in most countries; human
health suffers (Chapter 3, Section 3.4.6.1; Chapter 4, Sections 4.3.2 and 4.4.3; Chapter 5, Section 5.2.1).

Temperature peaks at 2°C of warming by the middle of the century before decreasing again owing to intensive implementation
of bioenergy plants with carbon capture and storage (Chapter 2), without efforts to minimize the land and water footprint of
bioenergy production (Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3). Reaching 2°C of warming for several decades eliminates or severely

seagrass beds (Chapter 3, Boxes 3.4 and 3.5, Sections 3.4.
storms, winds and waves. These changes increase the vulnerability and risks facing communities in tropical and subtropical regions,
with consequences for many coastal communities (Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5). These impacts are being amplified by
steadily rising sea levels (Chapter 3, Section 3.3.9) and intensifying storms (Chapter 3, Section 3.4.4.3). The intensive area required
for the production of bioenergy, combined with increasing water stress, puts pressure on food prices (Cross-Chapter Box 6 in
Chapter 3), driving elevated rates of food insecurity, hunger and poverty (Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2; Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter
3; Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4). Crop yields decline significantly in the tropics, leading to prolonged famines in some African

 

10 and 3.4.5), leads to much reduced levels of coastal defence from

countries (Chapter 3, Section 3.4; Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2). Food trumps environment in terms of importance in most countries, with
the result that natural ecosystems decrease in abundance, owing to climate change and land-use change (Cross-Chapter Box 7 in
Chapter 3). The ability to implement adaptive action to prevent the loss of ecosystems is hindered under the circumstances and
is consequently minimal (Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.6 and 3.4.4.10). Many natural ecosystems, in particular in the Mediterranean,
are lost because of the combined effects of climate change and land-use change, and extinction rates increase greatly (Chapter
3, Section 3.4 and Box 3.2).

Global mean warming reaches 3°C by 2100 but is not yet stabilized despite major decreases in yearly CO, emissions, as a net zero
CO, emissions budget could not yet be achieved and because of the long lifetime of CO, concentrations (Chapters 1, 2 and 3).
The world as it was in 2020 is no longer recognizable, with decreasing life expectancy, reduced outdoor labour productivity, and
lower quality of life in many regions because of too frequent heatwaves and other climate extremes (Chapter 4, Section 4.3.3).
Droughts and stress on water resources renders agriculture economically unviable in some regions (Chapter 3, Section 3.4; Chapter
4, Section 4.3.2) and contributes to increases in poverty (Chapter 5, Section 5.2.1; Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5). Progress on
the sustainable development goals is largely undone and poverty rates reach new highs (Chapter 5, Section 5.2.3). Major conflicts
take place (Chapter 3, Section 3.4.9.6; Chapter 5, Section 5.2.1). Almost all ecosystems experience irreversible impacts, species
extinction rates are high in all regions, forest fires escalate, and biodiversity strongly decreases, resulting in extensive losses to
ecosystem services. These losses exacerbate poverty and reduce quality of life (Chapter 3, Section 3.4; Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2).
Life for many indigenous and rural groups becomes untenable in their ancestral lands (Chapter 4, Box 4.3; Cross-Chapter Box 12
in Chapter 5). The retreat of the West Antarctic ice sheet accelerates (Chapter 3, Sections 3.3 and 3.6), leading to more rapid sea
level rise (Chapter 3, Section 3.3.9; Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2). Several small island states give up hope of survival in their locations
and look to an increasingly fragmented global community for refuge (Chapter 3, Box 3.5; Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5).
Aggregate economic damages are substantial, owing to the combined effects of climate changes, political instability, and losses
of ecosystem services (Chapter 4, Sections 4.4.1 and 4.4.2; Chapter 3, Box 3.6 and Section 3.5.2.4). The general health and well-
being of people is substantially reduced compared to the conditions in 2020 and continues to worsen over the following decades
(Chapter 5, Section 5.2.3).

"FAQ 3.1| What are the Impacts of 1.5°C and 2°C of Warming?
"	Title
"Essentially, the lower the rise in global temperature above pre-industrial levels, the lower the risks to human
societies and natural ecosystems. Put another way, limiting warming to 1.5°C can be understood in terms of
‘avoided impacts’ compared to higher levels of warming. Many of the impacts of climate change assessed in this
report have lower associated risks at 1.5°C compared to 2°C.
"	Text
"Thermal expansion of the ocean means sea level will continue to rise even if the increase in global temperature
is limited to 1.5°C, but this rise would be lower than in a 2°C warmer world. Ocean acidification, the process by
which excess CO, is dissolving into the ocean and increasing its acidity, is expected to be less damaging in a world
where CO, emissions are reduced and warming is stabilized at 1.5°C compared to 2°C. The persistence of coral
reefs is greater in a 1.5°C world than that of a 2°C world, too.
"	Text
"Change in climate means and extremes have knock-on effects for the societies and ecosystems living on the
planet. Climate change is projected to be a poverty multiplier, which means that its impacts are expected to make
the poor poorer and the total number of people living in poverty greater. The 0.5°C rise in global temperatures
that we have experienced in the past 50 years has contributed to shifts in the distribution of plant and animal
species, decreases in crop yields and more frequent wildfires. Similar changes can be expected with further rises
in global temperature.
"	Text
"The impacts of climate change that we experience in future will be affected by factors other than the change
in temperature. The consequences of 1.5°C of warming will additionally depend on the specific greenhouse gas
emissions ‘pathway’ that is followed and the extent to which adaptation can reduce vulnerability. This IPCC
Special Report uses a number of ‘pathways’ to explore different possibilities for limiting global warming to
1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. One type of pathway sees global temperature stabilize at, or just below, 1.5°C.

Another sees global temperature temporarily exceed 1.5°C before declining later in the century (known as an
‘overshoot’ pathway).
"	Text
"Human activity has warmed the world by about 1°C since pre-industrial times, and the impacts of this warming
have already been felt in many parts of the world. This estimate of the increase in global temperature is the
average of many thousands of temperature measurements taken over the world’s land and oceans. Temperatures
are not changing at the same speed everywhere, however: warming is strongest on continents and is particularly
strong in the Arctic in the cold season and in mid-latitude regions in the warm season. This is due to self-
amplifying mechanisms, for instance due to snow and ice melt reducing the reflectivity of solar radiation at the
surface, or soil drying leading to less evaporative cooling in the interior of continents. This means that some parts
of the world have already experienced temperatures greater than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
"	Text
"Summary: The impacts of climate change are being felt in every inhabited continent and in the oceans. However,
they are not spread uniformly across the globe, and different parts of the world experience impacts differently.
An average warming of 1.5°C across the whole globe raises the risk of heatwaves and heavy rainfall events,
amongst many other potential impacts. Limiting warming to 1.5°C rather than 2°C can help reduce these risks,
but the impacts the world experiences will depend on the specific greenhouse gas emissions ‘pathway’ taken.
The consequences of temporarily overshooting 1.5°C of warming and returning to this level later in the century,

for example, could be larger than if temperature stabilizes below 1.5°C. The size and duration of an overshoot
will also affect future impacts.
"	Text
"Extra warming on top of the approximately 1°C we have seen so far would amplify the risks and associated
impacts, with implications for the world and its inhabitants. This would be the case even if the global warming
is held at 1.5°C, just half a degree above where we are now, and would be further amplified at 2°C of global
warming. Reaching 2°C instead of 1.5°C of global warming would lead to substantial warming of extreme hot
days in all land regions. It would also lead to an increase in heavy rainfall events in some regions, particularly in
the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, potentially raising the risk of flooding. In addition, some regions,
such as the Mediterranean, are projected to become drier at 2°C versus 1.5°C of global warming. The impacts of
any additional warming would also include stronger melting of ice sheets and glaciers, as well as increased sea
level rise, which would continue long after the stabilization of atmospheric CO, concentrations.

"Such pathways would have different associated impacts, so it is important to distinguish between them for
planning adaptation and mitigation strategies. For example, impacts from an overshoot pathway could be larger
than impacts from a stabilization pathway. The size and duration of an overshoot would also have consequences
for the impacts the world experiences. For instance, pathways that overshoot 1.5°C run a greater risk of passing
through ‘tipping points’, thresholds beyond which certain impacts can no longer be avoided even if temperatures
are brought back down later on. The collapse of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets on the time scale of
centuries and millennia is one example of a tipping point.

"Executive Summary
"	Title
"The energy system transition that would be required to limit
global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial conditions is
underway in many sectors and regions around the world
(medium evidence, high agreement). The political, economic, social
and technical feasibility of solar energy, wind energy and electricity
storage technologies has improved dramatically over the past few
years, while that of nuclear energy and carbon dioxide capture
and storage (CCS) in the electricity sector have not shown similar
improvements. {4.3.1}
"	Text
"Changing agricultural practices can be an effective climate
adaptation strategy. A diversity of adaptation options exists,
including mixed crop-livestock production systems which can be a
cost-effective adaptation strategy in many global agriculture systems
(robust evidence, medium agreement). Improving irrigation efficiency
could effectively deal with changing global water endowments,
especially if achieved via farmers adopting new behaviours and water-
efficient practices rather than through large-scale infrastructural
interventions (medium evidence, medium agreement). Well-designed
adaptation processes such as community-based adaptation can be
effective depending upon context and levels of vulnerability. {4.3.2,
4.5.3}
"	Text
"Electrification, hydrogen, bio-based feedstocks and substitution,
and, in several cases, carbon dioxide capture, utilization and
storage (CCUS) would lead to the deep emissions reductions
required in energy-intensive industries to limit warming to
1.5°C. However, those options are limited by institutional, economic and
technical constraints, which increase financial risks to many incumbent
firms (medium evidence, high agreement). Energy efficiency in industry
is more economically feasible and helps enable industrial system
transitions but would have to be complemented with greenhouse gas
(GHG)-neutral processes or carbon dioxide removal (CDR) to make
energy-intensive industries consistent with 1.5°C (high confidence).
{4.3.1, 4.3.4}
"	Text
"Global and regional land-use and ecosystems transitions and
associated changes in behaviour that would be required to
limit warming to 1.5°C can enhance future adaptation and
land-based agricultural and forestry mitigation potential. Such
transitions could, however, carry consequences for livelihoods
that depend on agriculture and natural resources {4.3.2, Cross-
Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 3}. Alterations of agriculture and forest
systems to achieve mitigation goals could affect current ecosystems
and their services and potentially threaten food, water and livelihood
security. While this could limit the social and environmental feasibility
of land-based mitigation options, careful design and implementation
could enhance their acceptability and support sustainable development
objectives (medium evidence, medium agreement). {4.3.2, 4.5.3}
"	Text
"Adaptation needs will be lower in a 1.5°C world compared to
a 2°C world (high confidence) {Chapter 3; Cross-Chapter Box 11
in this chapter}. Learning from current adaptation practices and
strengthening them through adaptive governance {4.4.1}, lifestyle
and behavioural change {4.4.3} and innovative financing mechanisms
{4.4.5} can help their mainstreaming within sustainable development
practices. Preventing maladaptation, drawing on bottom-up approaches
{Box 4.6} and using indigenous knowledge {Box 4.3} would effectively
engage and protect vulnerable people and communities. While
adaptation finance has increased quantitatively, significant further
expansion would be needed to adapt to 1.5°C. Qualitative gaps in the
distribution of adaptation finance, readiness to absorb resources, and
monitoring mechanisms undermine the potential of adaptation finance
to reduce impacts. {Chapter 3, 4.4.2, 4.4.5, 4.6}
"	Text
"Limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels would
require transformative systemic change, integrated with
sustainable development. Such change would require the
upscaling and acceleration of the implementation of far-
reaching, multilevel and cross-sectoral climate mitigation
and addressing barriers. Such systemic change would need
to be linked to complementary adaptation actions, including
transformational adaptation, especially for pathways that
temporarily overshoot 1.5°C (medium evidence, highagreement)
{Chapter 2, Chapter 3, 4.2.1, 4.4.5, 4.5}. Current national pledges
on mitigation and adaptation are not enough to stay below the Paris
Agreement temperature limits and achieve its adaptation goals. While
transitions in energy efficiency, carbon intensity of fuels, electrification
and land-use change are underway in various countries, limiting
warming to 1.5°C will require a greater scale and pace of change to
transform energy, land, urban and industrial systems globally. {4.3, 4.4,
Cross-Chapter Box 9 in this Chapter}
"	Text
"Although multiple communities around the world are
demonstrating the possibility of implementation consistent with
1.5°C pathways {Boxes 4.1-4.10}, very few countries, regions,
cities, communities or businesses can currently make such
a claim (high confidence). To strengthen the global response,
almost all countries would need to significantly raise their level
of ambition. Implementation of this raised ambition would
require enhanced institutional capabilities in all countries,
including building the capability to utilize indigenous and local
knowledge (medium evidence, high agreement). In developing
countries and for poor and vulnerable people, implementing the
response would require financial, technological and other forms of
support to build capacity, for which additional local, national and
international resources would need to be mobilized (high confidence).
However, public, financial, institutional and innovation capabilities
currently fall short of implementing far-reaching measures at scale in
all countries (high confidence). Transnational networks that support
multilevel climate action are growing, but challenges in their scale-up
remain. {4.4.1, 4.4.2, 4.4.4, 4.4.5, Box 4.1, Box 4.2, Box 4.7}

"Mitigation and Adaptation Options and Other Measures
"	Title
"Synergies can be achieved across systemic transitions through
several overarching adaptation options in rural and urban areas.
Investments in health, social security and risk sharing and spreading
are cost-effective adaptation measures with high potential for scaling
up (medium evidence, medium to high agreement). Disaster risk
management and education-based adaptation have lower prospects of
scalability and cost-effectiveness (medium evidence, high agreement)
but are critical for building adaptive capacity. {4.3.5, 4.5.3}

"Shifts in dietary choices towards foods with lower emissions
and requirements for land, along with reduced food loss and
waste, could reduce emissions and increase adaptation options
(high confidence). Decreasing food loss and waste and changing
dietary behaviour could result in mitigation and adaptation (high

differ between options, limiting the potential for any single
option to sustainably achieve the large-scale deployment
required in the 1.5°C-consistent pathways described in
Chapter 2 (high confidence). Those 1.5°C pathways typically rely
on bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), afforestation
and reforestation (AR), or both, to neutralize emissions that are
expensive to avoid, or to draw down CO, emissions in excess of the
carbon budget {Chapter 2}. Though BECCS and AR may be technically
and geophysically feasible, they face partially overlapping yet different
constraints related to land use. The land footprint per tonne of CO,
removed is higher for AR than for BECCS, but given the low levels of
current deployment, the speed and scales required for limiting warming
to 1.5°C pose a considerable implementation challenge, even if the
issues of public acceptance and absence of economic incentives were
to be resolved (high agreement, medium evidence). The large potential
of afforestation and the co-benefits if implemented appropriately (e.g.,
on biodiversity and soil quality) will diminish over time, as forests
saturate (high confidence). The energy requirements and economic
costs of direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS) and enhanced
weathering remain high (medium evidence, medium agreement). At the

"A mix of mitigation and adaptation options implemented in a
participatory and integrated manner can enable rapid, systemic
transitions —in urban and rural areas— that are necessary
elements of an accelerated transition consistent with limiting
warming to 1.5°C. Such options and changes are most effective
when aligned with economic and sustainable development,
and when local and regional governments are supported by
national governments {4.3.3, 4.4.1, 4.4.3}. Various mitigation
options are expanding rapidly across many geographies. Although
many have development synergies, not all income groups have so
far benefited from them. Electrification, end-use energy efficiency
and increased share of renewables, amongst other options, are
lowering energy use and decarbonizing energy supply in the built
environment, especially in buildings. Other rapid changes needed in
urban environments include demotorization and decarbonization of
transport, including the expansion of electric vehicles, and greater use
of energy-efficient appliances (medium evidence high agreement).
Technological and social innovations can contribute to limiting
warming to 1.5°C, for example, by enabling the use of smart grids,
energy storage technologies and general-purpose technologies, such
as information and communication technology (ICT) that can be
deployed to help reduce emissions. Feasible adaptation options include
green infrastructure, resilient water and urban ecosystem services,

institutional and policy responses to deal with these challenges is
discussed in Section 4.4 together with the linkage between disruptive
changes in the energy sector and structural changes in other
infrastructure (transport, building, water and telecommunication)
sectors. A more in-depth assessment of the complexity and interfaces

"Not only the level of investment but also the type and speed of
sectoral transformation would be impacted by the transitions
associated with 1.5°C-consistent pathways. IAM literature projects
that investments in low-emission energy would overtake fossil
fuel investments globally by 2025 in 1.5°C-consistent pathways
(Chapter 2, Section 2.5.2). The projected low-emission investments
in electricity generation allocations over the period 2016-2050 are:
solar (0.09-1.0 trillion USD yr-""), wind (0.1-0.35 trillion USD yr-'),
nuclear (0.1-0.25 trillion USD yr-'), and transmission, distribution,
and storage (0.3—1.3 trillion USD yr-'). In contrast, investments in
fossil fuel extraction and unabated fossil electricity generation along
a 1.5°C-consistent pathway are projected to drop by 0.3—0.85 trillion
USD yr"" over the period 2016-2050, with investments in unabated
coal generation projected to halt by 2030 in most 1.5°C-consistent
pathways (Chapter 2, Section 2.5.2). Estimates of investments in
other infrastructure are currently unavailable, but they could be
considerably larger in volume than solely those in the energy sector
(Section 4.4.5).

"Some studies conduct a de-facto validation of IAM projections. For CO,
emission intensity over 1990-2010, this resulted in the IAMs projecting
declining emission intensities while actual observations showed an
increase. For individual technologies (in particular solar energy), IAM
projections have been conservative regarding deployment rates and
cost reductions (Creutzig et al., 2017), suggesting that IAMs do not
always impute actual rates of technological change resulting from
influence of shocks, broader changes and mutually reinforcing factors
in society and politics (Geels and Schot, 2007; Daron et al., 2015;
Sovacool, 2016; Battiston et al., 2017).

"Transformational adaptation can be adopted ata large scale, can lead
to new strategies in a region or resource system, transform places
and potentially shift locations (Kates et al., 2012). Some systems
might require transformational adaptation at 1.5°C. Implementing
adaptation policies in anticipation of 1.5°C would require
transformation and flexible planning of adaptation (sometimes
called adaptation pathways) (Rothman et al., 2014; Smucker et
al., 2015; Holland, 2017; Gajjar et al., 2018), an understanding of
the varied stakeholders involved and their motives, and knowledge
of less visible aspects of vulnerability based on social, cultural,
political, and economic factors (Holland, 2017). Transformational
adaptation would seek deep and long-term societal changes that
influence sustainable development (Chung Tiam Fook, 2017; Few
et al., 2017).

"Society-wide transformation involves socio-technical transitions
and social-ecological resilience (Gillard et al., 2016). Transitional
adaptation pathways would need to respond to low-emission
energy and economic systems, and the socio-technical transitions
for mitigation involve removing barriers in social and institutional
processes that could also benefit adaptation (Pant et al, 2015; Geels
et al., 2017; Ickowitz et al., 2017). In this chapter, transformative
change is framed in mitigation around socio-technical transitions, and
in adaptation around socio-ecological transitions. In both instances,
emphasis is placed on the enabling role of institutions (including
markets, and formal and informal regulation). 1.5°C-consistent
pathways and adaptation needs associated with warming of 1.5°C
imply both incremental and rapid, disruptive and transformative
changes.
"	Text
"In some regions and places, incremental adaptation would not
be sufficient to mitigate the impacts of climate change on social-
ecological systems (see Chapter 3). Transformational adaptation
would then be required (Bahadur and Tanner, 2014; Pant et al.,
2015; Gillard, 2016; Gillard et al., 2016; Colloff et al, 2017; Termeer
et al., 2017). Transformational adaptation refers to actions aiming
at adapting to climate change resulting in significant changes in
structure or function that go beyond adjusting existing practices
(Dowd et al., 2014; IPCC, 2014a; Few et al., 2017), including
approaches that enable new ways of decision-making on adaptation
(Colloff et al., 2017). Few studies have assessed the potentially
transformative character of adaptation options (Pelling et al., 2015;
Rippke et al., 2016; Solecki et al, 2017), especially in the context of
warming of 1.5°C.

"Other studies extrapolate historical trends into the future (Hd6k et al.,
2011; Fouquet, 2016), or contrast the rates of change associated with
specific temperature limits in IAMs (such as those in Chapter 2) with
historical trends to investigate plausibility of emission pathways and
associated temperature limits (Wilson et al. 2013; Gambhir et al., 2017;
Napp et al., 2017). When metrics are normalized to gross domestic
product (GDP; as opposed to other normalization metrics such as
primary energy), low-emission technology deployment rates used by
IAMs over the course of the coming century are shown to be broadly
consistent with past trends, but rates of change in emission intensity
are typically overestimated (Wilson et al., 2013; Loftus et al., 2014; van
Sluisveld et al., 2015). This bias is consistent with the findings from
the ‘validation’ studies cited above, suggesting that IAMs may under-
report the potential for supply-side technological change assumed
in 1.5°-consistent pathways, but may be more optimistic about the
systemic ability to realize incremental changes in reduction of emission
intensity as a consequence of favourable energy efficiency payback
times (Wilson et al., 2013). This finding suggests that barriers and
enablers other than costs and climate limits play a role in technological
change, as also found in the innovation literature (Hekkert et al., 2007;
Bergek et al., 2008; Geels et al., 2016b).
"	Text
"One barrier to a greater rate of change in energy systems is that
economic growth in the past has been coupled to the use of fossil
fuels. Disruptive innovation and socio-technical changes could enable
the decoupling of economic growth from a range of environmental
drivers, including the consumption of fossil fuels, as represented by
1.5°C-consistent pathways (UNEP, 2014; Newman, 2017). This may
be relative decoupling due to rebound effects that see financial
savings generated by renewable energy used in the consumption of
new products and services (Jackson and Senker, 2011; Gillingham et
al., 2013), but in 2015 and 2016 total global GHG emissions have
decoupled absolutely from economic growth (IEA, 2017g; Peters
et al., 2017). A longer data trend would be needed before stable
decoupling can be established. The observed decoupling in 2015
and 2016 was driven by absolute declines in both coal and oil use
since the early 2000s in Europe, in the past seven years in the United
States and Australia, and more recently in China (Newman, 2017).
In 2017, decoupling in China reversed by 2% due to a drought
and subsequent replacement of hydropower with coal-fired power
(Tollefson, 2017), but this reversal is expected to be temporary (IEA,
2017c). Oil consumption in China is still rising slowly, but absolute
decoupling is ongoing in megacities like Beijing (Gao and Newman,
2018) (see Box 4.9).

feasibility of individual options as well as the potential for synergies

"framework for transformational adaptation and the integration
of mitigation and adaptation pathways can transform rural
indigenous communities to address risks of climate change and
other stressors (Thornton and Comberti, 2017). In villages in rural
Nepal, transformational adaptation has taken place, with villagers
changing their agricultural and pastoralist livelihood strategies after
years of lost crops due to changing rain patterns and degradation
of natural resources (Thornton and Comberti, 2017). Instead, they
are now opening stores, hotels, and tea shops. In another case, the
arrival of an oil pipeline altered traditional Alaskan communities’
livelihoods. With growth of oil production, investments were made
for rural development. A later drop in oil production decreased these
investments. Alaskan indigenous populations are also dealing with
impacts of climate change, such as sea level rise, which is altering
their livelihood sources. Transformational adaptation is taking
place by changing the energy matrix to renewable energy, in which
indigenous people apply their knowledge to achieve environmental,
economic, and social benefits (Thornton and Comberti, 2017).

"Innovations that disrupt entire systems may leave firms and utilities
with stranded assets, as the transition can happen very quickly (IPCC,
2014b; Kossoy et al., 2015). This may have consequences for fossil
fuels that are rendered ‘unburnable’ (McGlade and Ekins, 2015) and
fossil fuel-fired power and industry assets that would become obsolete
(Caldecott, 2017; Farfan and Breyer, 2017). The presence of multiple
barriers and enablers operating in a system implies that rapid change,
whether the product of many small changes (Termeer et al., 2017)
or large-scale disruptions, is seldom an insular or discrete process
(Sterling et al., 2017). This finding informs the multidimensional nature
of feasibility in Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1 which is applied in
Section 4.5. Climate responses that are aligned with multiple feasibility
dimensions and combine adaptation and mitigation interventions with
non-climate benefits can accelerate change and reduce risks and costs
(Fazey et al., 2018). Also political, social and technological influences on
energy transitions, for example, can accelerate them faster than narrow
techno-economic analysis suggests is possible (Kern and Rogge, 2016),
but could also introduce new constraints and risks (Geels et al., 201 6b;

"Demand-ariven disruptive innovations that emerge as the product
of political and social changes across multiple scales can be
transformative (Seba, 2014; Christensen et al., 2015; Green and
Newman, 2017a). Such innovations would lead to simultaneous,
profound changes in behaviour, economies and societies (Seba, 2014;
Christensen et al. 2015), but are difficult to predict in supply-focused
economic models (Geels et al, 2016a; Pindyck, 2017). Rapid socio-
technical change has been observed in the solar industry (Creutzig et
al. (2017). Similar changes to socio-ecological systems can stimulate
adaptation and mitigation options that lead to more climate-resilient
systems (Adger et al., 2005; Ostrom, 2009; Gillard et al, 2016) (see
the Alaska and Nepal examples in Section 4.2.2.2). The increase in
roof-top solar and energy storage technology as well as the increase in
passive housing and net zero-emissions buildings are further examples
of such disruptions (Green and Newman, 2017b). Both roof-top solar
and energy storage have benefitted from countries’ economic growth
strategies and associated price declines in photovoltaic technologies,
particularly in China (Shrivastava and Persson, 2018), as well as from
new information and communication technologies (Koomey et al.,
2013), rising demand for electricity in urban areas, and global concern
regarding greenhouse gas emissions (Azeiteiro and Leal Filho, 2017;

"The largest growth driver for renewable energy since ARS has been
the dramatic reduction in the cost of solar photovoltaics (PV) (REN21,
2017). This has made rooftop solar competitive in sunny areas between
45° north and south latitude (Green and Newman, 2017b), though
IRENA (2018) suggests it is cost effective in many other places too. Solar
PV with batteries has been cost effective in many rural and developing
areas (Pueyo and Hanna, 2015; Szabo et al., 2016; Jimenez, 2017),
for example 19 million people in Bangladesh now have solar-battery
electricity in remote villages and are reporting positive experiences on
safety and ease of use (Kabir et al., 2017). Small-scale distributed energy
projects are being implemented in developed and developing cities
where residential and commercial rooftops offer potential for consumers
becoming producers (called prosumers) (ACOLA, 2017; Kotilainen and
Saari, 2018). Such prosumers could contribute significantly to electricity
generation in sun-rich areas like California (Kurdgelashvili et al, 2016)
or sub-Saharan Africa in combination with micro-grids and mini-grids
(Bertheau et al, 2017). It could also contribute to universal energy

"Bioenergy is renewable energy from biomass. Biofuel is biomass-based
energy used in transport. Chapter 2 suggests that pathways limiting
warming to 1.5°C would enable supply of 67-310 (median 150)
EJ yr-"" (see Table 2.8) from biomass. Most scenarios find that bioenergy
is combined with carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS, BECCS) if it
is available but also find robust deployment of bioenergy independent
of the availability of CCS (see Chapter 2, Section 2.3.4.2 and Section
4.3.7 for a discussion of BECCS). Detailed assessments indicate that
deployment is similar for pathways limiting global warming to below
2°C (Chum et al., 2011; P. Smith et al, 2014; Creutzig et al., 2015b).
There is however high agreement that the sustainable bioenergy
potential in 2050 would be restricted to around 100 EJ yr-' (Slade
et al., 2014; Creutzig et al, 2015b). Sustainable deployment at such
or higher levels envisioned by 1.5°C-consistent pathways may put
significant pressure on available land, food production and prices
(Popp et al., 2014b; Persson, 2015; Kline et al, 2017; Searchinger et
al., 2017), preservation of ecosystems and biodiversity (Creutzig et
al., 2015b; Holland et al, 2015; Santangeli et al., 2016), and potential
water and nutrient constraints (Gerbens-Leenes et al., 2009; Gheewala
et al., 2011; Bows and Smith, 2012; Smith and Torn, 2013; Bonsch et

2016b; Wei et al., 2016; Mathioudakis et al., 2017); but there is still low
agreement on these interactions (Robledo-Abad et al, 2017). Some
of the disagreement on the sustainable capacity for bioenergy stems
from global versus local assessments. Global assessments may mask
local dynamics that exacerbate negative impacts and shortages while
at the same time niche contexts for deployment may avoid trade-offs
and exploit co-benefits more effectively. In some regions of the world
(eg., the case of Brazilian ethanol, see Box 4.7, where land may be less
of a constraint, the use of bioenergy is mature and the industry is well
developed), land transitions could be balanced with food production
and biodiversity to enable a global impact on CO, emissions (Jaiswal
et al., 2017).

the costs of nuclear power are and have been is debated in the
literature (Lovering et al, 2016; Koomey et al., 2017). Countries with
liberalized markets that continue to develop nuclear employ de-risking
instruments through long-term contracts with guaranteed sale prices
(Finon and Roques, 2013). For instance, the United Kingdom works
with public guarantees covering part of the upfront investment costs
of newly planned nuclear capacity. This dynamic differs in countries
such as China and South Korea, where monopolistic conditions in
the electric system allow for reducing investment risks, deploying
series effects and enhancing the engineering capacities of users

"Even though scalability and speed of scaling of nuclear plants have
historically been high in many nations, such rates are currently not
achieved anymore. In the 1960s and 1970s, France implemented a
programme to rapidly get 80% of its power from nuclear in about
25 years (IAEA, 2018), but the current time lag between the decision
date and the commissioning of plants is observed to be 10-19 years
(Lovins et al, 2018). The current deployment pace of nuclear energy is
constrained by social acceptability in many countries due to concerns
over risks of accidents and radioactive waste management (Bruckner
et al. 2014). Though comparative risk assessment shows health risks
are low per unit of electricity production (Hirschberg et al., 2016), and
land requirement is lower than that of other power sources (Cheng and
Hammond, 2017), the political processes triggered by societal concerns
depend on the country-specific means of managing the political
debates around technological choices and their environmental impacts
(Gregory et al., 1993). Such differences in perception explain why the
2011 Fukushima incident resulted in a confirmation or acceleration of
phasing out nuclear energy in five countries (Roh, 2017) while 30 other

"The growth in electricity storage for renewables has been around grid
flexibility resources (GFR) that would enable several places to source
more than half their power from non-hydro renewables (Komarnicki,
2016). Ten types of GFRs within smart grids have been developed
(largely since AR5)(Blaabjerg et al., 2004; IRENA, 2013; IEA, 20174;
Majzoobi and Khodaei, 2017), though how variable renewables
can be balanced without hydro or natural gas-based power back-
up at a larger scale would still need demonstration. Pumped hydro
comprised 150 GW of storage capacity in 2016, and grid-connected
battery storage just 1.7 GW, but the latter grew between 2015 to
2016 by 50% (REN21, 2017). Battery storage has been the main
growth feature in energy storage since AR5 (Breyer et al. 2017).
This appears to the result of significant cost reductions due to mass
production for electric vehicles (EVs) (Nykvist and Nilsson, 2015; Dhar
et al., 2017). Although costs and technical maturity look increasingly
positive, the feasibility of battery storage is challenged by concerns
over the availability of resources and the environmental impacts of
its production (Peters et al, 2017). Lithium, a common element in
the earth's crust, does not appear to be restricted and large increases
in production have happened in recent years with eight new mines
in Western Australia where most lithium is produced (GWA, 2016).
Emerging battery technologies may provide greater efficiency and
recharge rates (Belmonte et al, 2016) but remain significantly more
expensive due to speed and scale issues compared to lithium ion

"The ARS (IPCC, 2014b) as well as Chapter 2, Section 2.4.2, assign
significant emission reductions over the course of this century to CO,
capture and storage (CCS) in the power sector. This section focuses
on CCS in the fossil-fuelled power sector; Section 4.3.4 discusses
CCS in non-power industry, and Section 4.3.7 discusses bioenergy
with CCS (BECCS). Section 2.4.2 puts the cumulative CO, stored
from fossil-fuelled power at 410 (199-470 interquartile range) GtCO,
over this century. Such modelling suggests that CCS in the power
sector can contribute to cost-effective achievement of emission
reduction requirements for limiting warming to 1.5°C. CCS may also
offer employment and political advantages for fossil fuel-dependent
economies (Kern et al., 2016), but may entail more limited co-benefits
than other mitigation options (that, e.g., generate power) and therefore
relies on climate policy incentives for its business case and economic
feasibility. Since 2017, two CCS projects in the power sector capture
2.4 MtCO, annually, while 30 MtCO, is captured annually in all CCS

"The technological maturity of CO, capture options in the power sectors
has improved considerably (Abanades et al. 2015; Bui et al., 2018),

learning in commercial settings and increased energy and resources
costs (Rubin et al., 2015). Storage capacity estimates vary greatly, but
Section 2.4.2 as well as literature (V. Scott et al., 2015) indicate that
perhaps 10,000 GtCO, could be stored in underground reservoirs.
Regional availability of this may not be sufficient, and it requires
efforts to have this storage and the corresponding infrastructure
available at the necessary rates and times (de Coninck and Benson,
2014). CO, retention in the storage reservoir was recently assessed
as 98% over 10,000 years for well-managed reservoirs, and 78%
for poorly regulated ones (Alcalde et al., 2018). A paper reviewing
42 studies on public perception of CCS (Seigo et al, 2014) found that
social acceptance of CCS is predicted by trust, perceived risks and
benefits. The technology itself mattered less than the social context of
the project. Though insights on communication of CCS projects to the
general public and inhabitants of the area around the CO, storage sites
have been documented over the years, project stakeholders are not
consistently implementing these lessons, although some projects have
observed good practices (Ashworth et al, 2015).

agricultural adaptation costs to 0.3% of total production costs while
abating deforestation by 76 Mha globally, making it a highly cost-
effective adaptation option with mitigation co-benefits (Weindl et
al., 2015). Evidence from various regions supports this (Thornton and
Herrero, 2015), although the feasible scale varies between regions and
systems, as well as being moderated by overall demand in specific
food products. In Australia, some farmers have successfully shifted
to crop-livestock systems where, each year, they allocate land and
forage resources in response to climate and price trends (Bell et al,
2014) . However, there can be some unintended negative impacts
of such integration, including increased burdens on women, higher
requirements of capital, competing uses of crop residues (e.g., feed

of management skills, which can be a challenge across several low

Finally, the feasibility of improving livestock efficiency is dependent
on socio-cultural context and acceptability: there remain significant

"Scenarios consistent with 1.5°C depend on a roughly 15% reduction

passenger vehicle sales by 2035-2050 was identified as a benchmark
for aligning with 1.5°C-consistent pathways (Kuramochi et al., 2018).
Reducing emissions from transport has lagged the power sector (Sims
et al., 2014; Creutzig et al, 2015a), but evidence since AR5 suggests
that cities are urbanizing and re-urbanizing in ways that coordinate
transport sector adaptation and mitigation (Colenbrander et al., 2017;
Newman et al., 2017; Salvo et al., 2017; Gota et al., 2018). The global
transport sector could reduce 4.7 GtCO,e yr‘ (4.1-5.3) by 2030.
This is significantly more than is predicted by integrated assessment
models (UNEP, 2017b). Such a transition depends on cities that
enable modal shifts and avoided journeys and that provide incentives
for uptake of improved fuel efficiency and changes in urban design
that encourage walkable cities, non-motorized transport and shorter
commuter distances (IEA, 2016a; Mittal et al, 2016; Zhang et al.,
2016; Li and Loo, 2017). In at least 4 African cities, 43 Asian cities
and 54 Latin American cities, transit-oriented development (TOD),
has emerged as an organizing principle for urban growth and spatial
planning (Colenbrander et al., 2017; Lwasa, 2017; BRTData, 2018).
This trend is important to counter the rising demand for private cars in
developing-country cities (AfDB/OECD/UNDP, 2016). In India, TOD has
been combined with localized solar PV installations and new ways of

"Industry consumes about one-third of global final energy and contributes,
directly and indirectly, about one-third of global GHG emissions (IPCC,
2014b). If the increase in global mean temperature is to remain under
1.5°C, modelling indicates that industry cannot emit more than 2
GtCO, in 2050, corresponding to a reduction of between 67 and 91%
(interquartile range) in GHG emissions compared to 2010 (see Chapter
2, Figures 2.20 and 2.21, and Table 4.1). Moreover, the consequences
of warming of 1.5°C or more pose substantial challenges for industrial
diversity. This section will first briefly discuss the limited literature on
adaptation options for industry. Subsequently, new literature since ARS

"Urban surface-sealing with impervious materials affects the volume
and velocity of runoff and flooding during intense rainfall (Skougaard
Kaspersen et al., 2015), but urban design in many cities now seeks
to mediate runoff, encourage groundwater recharge and enhance
water quality (Liu et al, 2014; Lamond et al., 2015; Voskamp and
Van de Ven, 2015; Costa et al, 2016; Mguni et al., 2016; Xie et al,

reported to be increasing in frequency and intensity in some locations
(Ziervogel et al., 2016b), and urban flooding is expected to increase at
1.5°C of warming (Alfieri et al., 2017). This risk falls disproportionately
on women and poor people in cities (Mitlin, 2005; Chu et al., 2016;

environmental issues is not available, but substitution could play a large
role in reducing emissions (Ahman et al., 2016) although its potential
depends on the demand for material and the turnover rate of, for
example, buildings (Haas et al., 2015). Material substitution and CO,
storage options are under development, for example, the use of algae
and renewable energy for carbon fibre production, which could become
a net sink of CO, (Amold et al., 2018).

"Cross-sector technologies and practices, which play a role in all
industrial sectors including small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
and non-energy intensive industry, also offer potential for considerable
energy efficiency improvements. They include: (i) motor systems (for
example electric motors, variable speed drives, pumps, compressors
and fans), responsible for about 10% of worldwide industrial energy
consumption, with a global energy efficiency improvement potential of
around 20-25% (Napp et al., 2014); and (ii) steam systems, responsible
for about 30% of industrial energy consumption and energy saving
potentials of about 10% (Hasanbeigi et al., 2014; Napp et al., 2014).
Waste heat recovery from industry has substantial potential for energy
efficiency and emission reduction (Forman et al., 2016). Low awareness
and competition from other investments limit the feasibility of such
options (Napp et al., 2014).

"Depending on the industrial sector, mitigation consistent with 1.5°C
would mean, across industries, a reduction of final energy demand
by one-third, an increase of the rate of recycling of materials and the
development of a circular economy in industry (Lewandowski, 2016;
Linder and Williander, 2017), the substitution of materials in high-
carbon products with those made up of renewable materials (e.g., wood
instead of steel or cement in the construction sector, natural textile
fibres instead of plastics), and a range of deep emission reduction
options, including use of bio-based feedstocks, low-emission heat
sources, electrification of production processes, and/or capture and
storage of all CO, emissions by 2050 (Ahman et al., 2016). Some of the
choices for mitigation options and routes for GHG-intensive industry
are discrete and potentially subject to path dependency: if an industry
goes one way (e.g., in keeping existing processes), it will be harder to
transition to process change (e.g., electrification) (Bataille et al., 2018).
In the context of rising demand for construction, an increasing share
of industrial production may be based in developing countries (N. Li et
al., 2017), where current efficiencies may be lower than in developed
countries, and technical and institutional feasibility may differ (Ma et
al. 2015).

"Whether carbon dioxide utilization (CCU) can contribute to limiting
warming to 1.5°C depends on the origin of the CO, (fossil, biogenic
or atmospheric), the source of electricity for converting the CO,
or regenerating catalysts, and the lifetime of the product. Review
studies indicate that CO, utilization in industry has a small role to
play in limiting warming to 1.5°C because of the limited potential of
reusing CO, with currently available technologies and the re-emission
of CO, when used as a fuel (IPCC, 2005b; Mac Dowell et al., 2017).
However, new developments could make CCU more feasible, in
particular in CO, use as a feedstock for carbon-based materials that
would isolate CO, from the atmosphere for a long time, and in low-
cost, low-emission electricity that would make the energy use of CO,
capture more sustainable. The conversion of CO, to fuels using zero-
emission electricity has a lower technical, economic and environmental
feasibility than direct CO, capture and storage from industry (Abanades

"CO, capture in industry is generally considered more feasible than CCS
in the power sector (Section 4.3.1) or from bioenergy sources (Section
4.3.7), although CCS in industry faces similar barriers. Almost all of
the current full-scale (>1MtCO, yr-') CCS projects capture CO, from
industrial sources, including the Sleipner project in Norway, which has
been injecting CO, from a gas facility in an offshore saline formation
since 1996 (Global CCS Institute, 2017). Compared to the power
sector, retrofitting CCS on existing industrial plants would leave the
production process of materials relatively untouched (Ahman et al,
2016), though significant investments and modifications still have to
be made. Some industries, in particular cement, emit CO, as inherent
process emissions and can therefore not reduce emissions to zero
without CC(U)S. CO, stacks in some industries have a high economic
and technical feasibility for CO, capture as the CO, concentration in
the exhaust gases is relatively high (IPCC, 2005b; Leeson et al., 2017),
but others require strong modifications in the production process,
limiting technical and economic feasibility, though costs remain
lower than other deep GHG reduction options (Rubin et al, 2015).
There are indications that the energy use in CO, capture through

The Arctic is undergoing the most rapid climate change globally (Larsen et al., 2014), warming by 1.9°C over the last 30 years

summer are substantially higher than at 1.5°C (see Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.5 and 3.3.8), with permafrost melt, increased instances
of storm surge, and extreme weather events anticipated along with later ice freeze up, earlier break up, and a longer ice-free open

In sub-Saharan Africa, cash transfer programmes targeting poor communities have proven
successful in smoothing household welfare and food security during droughts, strengthening

Education and

Behavioural change and institutional capacity: social learning
strengthens adaptation and affects longer-term change (Clemens

Participatory scenario planning is a process by which multiple stakeholders work together
to envision future scenarios under a range of climatic conditions (Oteros-Rozas et al.,
2015; Butler et al., 2016; Flynn et al. 2018).

 

Population health
and health system

Institutional capacity: 1.5°C warming will primarily exacerbate
existing health challenges (K.R. Smith et al. 2014), which can
be targeted by enhancing health services.

Heatwave early warning and response systems coordinate the implementation of multiple
measures in response to predicted extreme temperatures (e.g., public announcements,
opening public cooling shelters, distributing information on heat stress symptoms)
(Knowlton et al., 2014; Takahashi et al., 2015; Nitschke et al., 2016, 2017).

 

Indigenous
knowledge

Institutional capacity and behavioural change: knowledge of
environmental conditions helps communities detect and monitor
change (Johnson et al., 2015; Mistry and Berardi, 2016;

Williams et al., 2017).

Options such as integration of indigenous knowledge into resource management systems
and school curricula, are identified as potential adaptations (Cunsolo Willox et al., 2013;
McNamara and Prasad, 2014; MacDonald et al., 2015; Pearce et al., 2015; Chambers

Human migration

Governance: revising and adopting migration issues in national
disaster risk management policies, National Adaptation Plans
and NDCs (Kuruppu and Willie, 2015; Yamamoto et al., 2017).

In dryland India, populations in rural regions already experiencing 1.5°C warming are
migrating to cities (Gajjar et al., 2018) but are inadequately covered by existing
policies (Bhagat, 2017).

 

 

Climate services

 

Technological innovation: rapid technical development (due to
increased financial inputs and growing demand) is improving
quality of climate information provided (Rogers and Tsirkunov,
2010; Clements et al., 2013; Perrels et al., 2013; Gasc et al., 2014;
WMO, 2015; Roudier et al., 2016).

 

Climate services are seeing wide application in sectors such as agriculture, health,
disaster management and insurance (Lourenco et al., 2016; Vaughan et al., 2018),
with implications for adaptation decision-making (Singh et al., 2017).

Extreme weather, linked to tropical storms and hurricanes, represent one of the largest risks facing Caribbean island nations
(Chapter 3, Section 3.4.5.3). Non-economic damages include detrimental health impacts, forced displacement and destruction of
cultural heritages. Projections of increased frequency of the most intense storms at 1.5°C and higher warming levels (Wehner et

climate change (e.g., drought, forest fires and pests) (Seidl et al., 2017).
Handling these challenges requires careful forest management. There
is much practical experience with AR, facilitating upscaling but with
two caveats: AR potentials are heterogeneously distributed (Bala et al.,
2007), partly because the planting of less reflective forests results in
higher net absorbed radiation and localised surface warming in higher

diversified agricultural landscapes with monocultures or invasive alien

arable and permanent crop area in 2100. Land area estimates differ
in scale and are not necessarily a good indicator of competition with,
for example, food production, because requiring a smaller land area for
the same potential could indicate that high-productivity agricultural
land is used. In general, the literature shows low agreement on the
availability of land (Fritz et al., 2011; see Erb et al., 2016b for recent
advances). Productivity, food production and competition with other
ecosystem services and land use by local communities are important
factors for designing regulation. These potentials and trade-offs are not
homogenously distributed across regions. However, Robledo-Abad et
al. (2017) find that regions with higher potentials are understudied,
given their potential contribution. Researchers have expressed the
need to complement global assessments with regional, geographically
explicit bottom-up studies of biomass potentials and socio-economic
impacts (e.g., de Wit and Faaij, 2010; Kraxner et al., 2014; Baik et al.,

affects nutrients and food security favourably (high agreement, robust
evidence) and can be applied without changing current land use, thus
making it socially more acceptable than CDR options with a high land
footprint. However, soil sinks saturate after 10-100 years, depending
on the SCS option, soil type and climate zone (Smith, 2016).

(Taylor et al., 2016), the release of heavy metals like Ni and Cr and plant
nutrients like K, Ca, Mg, P and Si (Hartmann et al., 2013), and changes in
hydrological soil properties. Respirable particle sizes, though resulting in
higher potentials, can have impacts on health (Schuiling and Krijgsman,

However, 40-260 Mha are needed to grow the biomass for biochar
for implementation at 0.3 GtCO,-eq yr (Smith, 2016), even though
it is also possible to use residues (e.g., Windeatt et al., 2014). Biochar

"Weathering is the natural process of rock decomposition via chemical
and physical processes in which CO, is spontaneously consumed and
converted to solid or dissolved alkaline bicarbonates and/or carbonates
(IPCC, 2005a). The process is controlled by temperature, reactive
surface area, interactions with biota and, in particular, water solution
composition. CDR can be achieved by accelerating mineral weathering
through the distribution of ground-up rock material over land
(Hartmann and Kempe, 2008; Wilson et al, 2009; Kohler et al., 2010;
Renforth, 2012; ten Berge et al., 2012; Manning and Renforth, 2013;

al., 2017) or the open ocean (House et al., 2007; Harvey, 2008; Kohler
et al., 2013; Hauck et al., 2016). Ocean alkalinization adds alkalinity to
marine areas to locally increase the CO, buffering capacity of the ocean

2013; Taylor et al., 2016; Strefler et al., 2018a). Marine application
of ground minerals is limited by feasible rates of mineral extraction,
grinding and delivery, with estimates of 1-6 GtCO, yr (low evidence,
low agreement) (Kéhler et al, 2013; Hauck et al., 2016; Renforth and
Henderson, 2017). Agreement is low due to a variety of assumptions
and unknown parameter ranges in the applied modelling procedures

"Capturing CO, from ambient air through chemical processes with
subsequent storage of the CO, in geological formations is independent
of source and timing of emissions and can avoid competition for land.
Yet, this is also the main challenge: while the theoretical potential
for DACCS is mainly limited by the availability of safe and accessible
geological storage, the CO, concentration in ambient air is 100-300
times lower than at gas- or coal-fired power plants (Sanz-Pérez et al.,
2016) thus requiring more energy than flue gas CO, capture (Pritchard

"Nutrients can be added to the ocean resulting in increased biologic
production, leading to carbon fixation in the sunlit ocean and
subsequent sequestration in the deep ocean or sea floor sediments.
The added nutrients can be either micronutrients (such as iron) or
macronutrients (such as nitrogen and/or phosphorous) (Harrison,
2017). There is limited evidence and low agreement on the readiness of
this technology to contribute to rapid decarbonization (Williamson et
al., 2012). Only small-scale field experiments and theoretical modelling
have been conducted (e.g., McLaren, 2012). The full range of CDR
potential estimates is from 15.2 ktCO, yr (Bakker et al, 2001) for a
spatially constrained field experiment up to 44 GtCO, yr (Sarmiento
and Orr, 1991) following a modelling approach, but Fuss et al. (2018)
consider the potential to be extremely limited given the evidence and
existing barriers. Due to scavenging of iron, the iron addition only leads
to inefficient use of the nitrogen in exporting carbon (Zeebe, 2005;

Fertilization is expected to impact food webs by stimulating its base
organisms (Matear, 2004), and extensive algal blooms may cause
anoxia (Sarmiento and Orr, 1991; Matear, 2004; Russell et al., 2012)
and deep water oxygen decline (Matear, 2004), with negative impacts
on biodiversity. Nutrient inputs can shift ecosystem production from
an iron-limited system to a P, N-, or Si-limited system depending on
the location (Matear, 2004; Bertram, 2010) and non-CO, GHGs may
increase (Sarmiento and Orr, 1991; Matear, 2004; Bertram, 2010). The
greatest theoretical potential for this practice is the Southern Ocean,
posing challenges for monitoring and governance (Robinson et al.,
2014). The London Protocol of the International Maritime Organization
has asserted authority for regulation of ocean fertilization (Strong et al.,
2009), which is widely viewed as a de facto moratorium on commercial
ocean fertilization activities.

© CDR options are at different stages of technological readiness (McLaren, 2012) and differ with respect to scalability.

© Nemet et al. (2018) find >50% of the CDR innovation literature concerned with the earliest stages of the innovation process (R&D), identifying a
dissonance between the large CO, removals needed in 1.5°C pathways and the long -time periods involved in scaling up novel technologies.

* Lack of post-R&D literature, including incentives for early deployment, niche markets, scale up, demand, and public acceptance.

© For BECCS, there are niche opportunities with high efficiencies and fewer trade-offs, for example, sugar and paper processing facilities (Méllersten et al., 2003),
district heating (Karki et al., 2013; Ericsson and Werner, 2016), and industrial and municipal waste (Sanna et al., 2012). Turner et al. (2018) constrain potential using
sustainability considerations and overlap with storage basins to avoid the CO, transportation challenge, providing a possible, though limited entry point for BECCS.

The impacts on land use, water, nutrients and albedo of BECCS could be alleviated using marine sources of biomass that could include aquacultured micro
and macro flora (Hughes et al., 2012; Lenton, 2014).

Regarding captured CO, as a resource is discussed as an entry point for CDR. However, this does not necessarily lead to carbon removals, particularly if
the CO, is sourced from fossil fuels and/or if the products do not store the CO, for climate-relevant horizons (von der Assen et al., 2013) (see also Section 4.3.4.5).
Methane’ is a much more potent GHG than CO, (Montzka et al., 2011), associated with difficult-to-abate emissions in industry and agriculture and with
outgassing from lakes, wetlands, and oceans (Lockley, 2012; Stolaroff et al., 2012). Enhancing processes that naturally remove methane, either by chemical

or biological decomposition (Sundqvist et al., 2012), has been proposed to remove CH,. There is low confidence that existing technologies for CH,
removal are economically or energetically suitable for large-scale air capture (Boucher and Folberth, 2010). Methane removal potentials are limited due to
its low atmospheric concentration and its low chemical reactivity at ambient conditions.

Preston (2013) identifies distributive and procedural justice, permissibility, moral hazard (Shue, 2018), and hubris as ethical aspects that could apply to
large-scale CDR deployment.
There is a lack of reflection on the climate futures produced by recent modelling and implying very different ethical costs/risks and benefits (Minx et al., 2018).

Existing governance mechanisms are scarce and either targeted at particular CDR options (e.g., ocean-based) or aspects (e.g., concerning indirect land-use
change (iLUC)) associated with bioenergy upscaling, and often the mechanisms are at national or regional scale (e.g., EU). Regulation accounting for iLUC
by formulating sustainability criteria (e.g., the EU Renewable Energy Directive) has been assessed as insufficient in avoiding leakage (e.g., Frank et al., 2013).
An intemational goverance mechanism is only in place for R&D of ocean fertilization within the Convention on Biological Diversity (IMO, 1972, 1996; CBD, 2008, 2010).
Burns and Nicholson (2017) propose a human rights-based approach to protect those potentially adversely impacted by CDR options.

The CDR potentials that can be realized are constrained by the lack of policy portfolios incentivising large-scale CDR (Peters and Geden, 2017).

Near-term opportunities could be supported through modifying existing policy mechanisms (Lomax et al., 2015).

Scott and Geden (2018) sketch three possible routes for limited progress, (i) at EU-level, (ii) at EU Member State level, and (iii) at private sector level, noting
the implied paradigm shift this would entail.

EU may struggle to adopt policies for CDR deployment on the scale or time-frame envisioned by IAMs (Geden et al., 2018).

Social impacts of large-scale CDR deployment (Buck, 2016) require policies taking these into account.

On long time scales, natural sinks could reverse (C.D. Jones et al., 2016)
No robust assessments yet of the effectiveness of CDR in reverting climate change (Tokarska and Zickfeld, 2015; Wu et al., 2015; Keller et al., 2018),
see also Chapter 2, Section 2.2.2.2.

Published SRM approaches are summarized in Table 4.7. The timing and magnitude of potential SRM deployment depends on
the temperature overshoot associated with mitigation pathways. All overshooting pathways make use of carbon dioxide removal.

a subtle difference in the articulation of information about SRM can
influence subsequent judgements of favourability (Merk et al. 2016).

work on SRM is generally approved of, field research much less so,

"Solar radiation modification (SRM) refers to a range of radiation modification measures not related to greenhouse gas (GHG)
mitigation that seek to limit global warming (see Chapter 1, Section 1.4.1). Most methods involve reducing the amount of incoming
solar radiation reaching the surface, but others also act on the longwave radiation budget by reducing optical thickness and cloud
lifetime (see Table 4.7). In the context of this report, SRM is assessed in terms of its potential to limit warming below 1.5°C in
temporary overshoot scenarios as a way to reduce elevated temperatures and associated impacts (Irvine et al., 2016; Keith and
Irvine, 2016; Chen and Xin, 2017; Sugiyama et al., 2017a; Visioni et al., 2017a; MacMartin et al., 2018). The inherent variability of the
climate system would make it difficult to detect the efficacy or side-effects of SRM intervention when deployed in such a temporary

It has been proposed that deploying SRM as a supplement to mitigation may reduce increases in global temperature-related
extremes and rainfall intensity, and lessen the loss of coral reefs from increasing sea-surface temperatures (Keith and Irvine, 2016),

"Another concern with SRM is the risk of a ‘termination shock’ or ‘termination effect’ when suddenly stopping SRM, which might
cause rapid temperature rise and associated impacts (Jones et al., 2013; Izrael et al., 2014; McCusker et al., 2014), most noticeably
biodiversity loss (Trisos et al., 2018). The severity of the termination effect has recently been debated (Parker and Irvine, 2018) and
depends on the degree of SRM cooling. This report only considers limited SRM in the context of mitigation pathways to 1.5°C. Other
risks of SRM deployment could be associated with the lack of testing of the proposed deployment schemes (e.g., Schafer et al.,
2013). Ethical aspects and issues related to the governance and economics are discussed in Section 4.3.8.

"Despite the large uncertainties in the simulated climate response to SRM, current model simulations suggest that SRM would
lead to altered carbon budgets compatible with 1.5°C or 2°C. The 6 CMIP5 models investigated simulated an increase of natural
carbon uptake by land biosphere and, to a smaller extent, by the oceans (high agreement). The multimodel mean of this response
suggests an increase of the RCP4.5 carbon budget of about 150 GtCO, after 50 years of SO, injection with a rate of 4 TgS yr"", which
represents about 4 years of CO, emissions at the current rate (36 GtCO, yr-'). However, there is uncertainty around quantitative
determination of the effects that SRM or its cessation has on the carbon budget due to a lack of understanding of the radiative
processes driving the global carbon cycle response to SRM (Ramachandran et al., 2000; Mercado et al., 2009; Eliseev, 2012; Xia et

There are few studies investigating potential implications of SRM for sustainable development. These are based on a limited
number of scenarios and hypothetical considerations, mainly referring to benefits from lower temperatures (Irvine et al, 2011;
Nicholson, 2013; Anshelm and Hansson, 2014; Harding and Moreno-Cruz, 2016). Other studies suggest negative impacts from SRM
implementation concerning issues related to regional disparities (Heyen et al., 2015), equity (Buck, 2012), fisheries, ecosystems,
agriculture, and termination effects (Robock, 2012; Morrow, 2014; Wong, 2014). If SRM is initiated by the richer nations, there might
be issues with local agency, and possibly worsening conditions for those suffering most under climate change (Buck et al., 2014).
In addition, ethical issues related to testing SRM have been raised (e.g., Lenferna et al, 2017). Overall, there is high agreement that
SRM would affect many development issues but limited evidence on the degree of influence, and how it manifests itself across
regions and different levels of society.

"Other approaches are less well researched, but the literature suggests that ground-based albedo modification (GBAM), marine cloud
brightening (MCB) or cirrus cloud thinning (CCT) are not assessed to be able to substantially reduce overall global temperature
(Irvine et al., 2011; Seneviratne et al., 2018). However, these SRM approaches are known to create spatially heterogeneous forcing
and potentially more spatially heterogeneous climate effects, which may be used to mitigate regional climate impacts. This may
be of most relevance in the case of GBAM when applied to crop and urban areas (Seneviratne et al., 2018). Most of the literature
on regional mitigation has focused on GBAM in relationship with land-use and land-cover change scenarios. Both models and
observations suggest that there is a high agreement that GBAM would result in cooling over the region of changed albedo, and in
particular would reduce hot extremes (Irvine et al., 2011; Akbari et al., 2012; Jacobson and Ten Hoeve, 2012; Davin et al., 2014; Crook
et al., 2015, 2016; Alkama and Cescatti, 2016; Seneviratne et al., 2018). In comparison, there is a limited evidence on the ability of
MCB or CCT to mitigate regional climate impacts of 1.5°C warming because the magnitude of the climate response to MCB or CCT
remains uncertain and the processes are not fully understood (Lohmann and Gasparini, 2017).

indirect influence over the viability of 1.5°C-consistent pathways

vertical collaboration within nation-states can play an enabling role
(Ringel, 2017). Vertical and horizontal collaboration requires synergistic

Gupta, 2014; Méjean et al., 2015) and a climate-centric vision (Shukla,

drove resistance from many developing nations (Roberts and Parks,

process among nations to decide who should be allocated ‘how much’
of the remainder of the emissions budget (Caney, 2014; Ohndorf et al.,

"There are significant differences between global mitigation and
adaptation governance frames. Mitigation tends to be global by its
nature and based on the principle of the climate system as a global
commons (Ostrom et al. 1999). Adaptation has traditionally been
viewed as a local process, involving local authorities, communities,
and stakeholders (Khan, 2013; Preston et al., 2015), although it is now
recognized to be a multi-scaled, multi-actor process that transcends
scales from local and sub-national to national and international
(Mimura et al., 2014; UNEP, 2017a). National governments provide a
central pivot for coordination, planning, determining policy priorities
and distributing resources. National governments are accountable
to the international community through international agreements.
Yet, many of the impacts of climate change are transboundary, so
that bilateral and multilateral cooperation are needed (Nalau et al.,
2015; Donner et al., 2016; Magnan and Ribera, 2016; Tilleard and Ford,

Protocol demonstrates that a global environmental agreement
facilitating common but differentiated responsibilities is possible

acting first, with developing countries following and benefiting from
leap-frogging the trial-and-error stages of innovative technology

"The paradigm shift enabled at Cancun succeeded by focusing on the
objective of ‘equitable access to sustainable development’ (Hourcade
et al., 2015). The use of ‘pledge and review’ now underpins the Paris
Agreement. This consolidates multiple attempts to define a governance
approach that relies on Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)
and on means for a ‘facilitative model’ (Bodansky and Diringer, 2014)
to reinforce them. This enables a regular, iterative, review of NDCs
allowing countries to set their own ambitions after a global stocktake
and more flexible, experimental forms of climate governance, which may
provide room for higher ambition and be consistent with the needs of
governing for a rapid transition to close the emission gap (Clemencon,
2016; Falkner, 2016) (Cross-Chapter Box 11 in this chapter). Beyond
a general consensus on the necessity of measurement, reporting and
verification (MRV) mechanisms as a key element of a climate regime
(Ford et al., 2015b; van Asselt et al., 2015), some authors emphasize
different governance approaches to implement the Paris Agreement.
Through the new proposed sustainable development mechanism in
Article 6, the Paris Agreement allows the space to harness the lowest
cost mitigation options worldwide. This may incentivize policymakers
to enhance mitigation ambition by speeding up climate action as part
of a ‘climate regime complex’ (Keohane and Victor, 2011) of loosely
interrelated global governance institutions. In the Paris Agreement, the
‘common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities’
(CBDR-RC) principle could be expanded and revisited under a ‘sharing
the pie’ paradigm (Ji and Sha, 2015) as a tool to open innovation
processes towards alternative development pathways (Chapter 5).

(Berrang-Ford et al, 2011; Ford and Berrang-Ford, 2016; Magnan,
2016; Magnan and Ribera, 2016). Many developing countries have
made progress in formulating national policies, plans and strategies on
responding to climate change. The NDCs have been identified as one
such institutional mechanism (Cross-Chapter Box 11 in this Chapter)

"By 2050, it is estimated three billion people will be living in slums and
informal settlements: neighbourhoods without formal governance, on
un-zoned land developments and in places that are exposed to climate-
related hazards (Bai et al, 2018). Emerging research is examining how
citizens can contribute informally to governance with rapid urbanization
and weaker government regulation (Sarmiento and Tilly, 2018). It
remains to be seen how the possibilities and consequences of alternative
urban governance models will be managed for large, complex problems

intervene to reduce climate impacts (Bulkeley et al., 2011), either by
implementing climate objectives defined at higher government levels
or by taking initiative autonomously or collectively (Aall et al, 2007;
Reckien et al., 2014; Araos et al., 2016a; Heidrich et al., 2016). Local
governance faces the challenge of reconciling local concerns with
global objectives. Local governments could coordinate and develop
effective local responses, and could pursue procedural justice in
ensuring community engagement and more effective policies around
energy and vulnerability reduction (Moss et al. 2013; Fudge et al,
2016). They can enable more participative decision-making (Barrett,
2015; Hesse, 2016). Fudge et al. (2016) argue that local authorities
are well-positioned to involve the wider community in: designing
and implementing climate policies, engaging with sustainable energy

the delivery of demand-side measures and adaptation implementation.

interest or vested interests, strong leadership and agency is needed by
political leaders. As shown by the Covenant of Mayors initiative (Box

can succeed in reducing GHG emissions, when they are supported by
civil society (Rivas et al., 2015; Croci et al, 2017; Kona et al. 2018).
Any political vision would need to be translated into an action plan,
which could include elements describing policies and measures needed
to achieve transition, the human and financial resources needed,
milestones, and appropriate measurement and verification processes
(Azevedo and Leal, 2017). Discussing the plan with stakeholders
and civil society, including citizens and allowing for participation for
minorities, and having them provide input and endorse it, has been
found to increase the likelihood of success (Rivas et al., 2015; Wamsler,
2017). However, as described by Nightingale (2017) and Green (2016),
struggles over natural resources and adaptation governance both at
the national and community levels would also need to be addressed
‘in politically unstable contexts, where power and politics shape

GHG emissions. The local Chamber of Commerce also had a key role in the implementation of these projects by the municipalities

"Since 2005, cities have emerged as a locus of institutional and governance climate innovation (Melica et al, 2018) and are driving
responses to climate change (Roberts, 2016). Many cities have adopted more ambitious greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction
targets than countries (Kona et al., 2018), with an overall commitment of GHG emission reduction targets by 2020 of 27%, almost
7 percentage points higher than the minimum target for 2020 (Kona et al., 2018). The Covenant of Mayors (CoM) is an initiative
in which municipalities voluntarily commit to CO, emission reduction. The participation of small municipalities has been facilitated
by the development and testing of a new multilevel governance model involving Covenant Territorial Coordinators (CTCs), ie.,
provinces and regions, which commit to providing strategic guidance and financial and technical support to municipalities in their
territories. Results from the 315 monitoring inventories submitted show an achievement of 23% reduction in emissions (compared
to an average year 2005) for more than half of the cities under a CTC schema (Kona et al., 2018).

Achieving ambitious targets would need leadership, enhanced multilevel governance, vision and widespread participation in
transformative change (Castan Broto and Bulkeley, 2013; Rosenzweig et al., 2015; Castan Broto, 2017; Fazey et al., 2017; Wamsler,

and community scales, show that participation, social learning and iterative decision-making are governance features of strategies
that deliver mitigation, adaptation, and sustainable development in a fair and equitable manner. Another insight is the finding
that incremental voluntary changes are amplified through community networking, polycentric governance (Dorsch and Flachsland,
2017), partnerships, and long-term change to governance systems at multiple levels (Stevenson and Dryzek, 2014; Lovbrand et al.,

"A multilevel approach considers that adaptation planning is affected
by scale mismatches between the local manifestation of climate
impacts and the diverse scales at which the problem is driven (Shi
et al, 2016). Multilevel approaches may be relevant in low-income
countries where limited financial resources and human capabilities
within local governments often lead to greater dependency on
national governments and other (donor) organizations, to strengthen
adaptation responses (Donner et al., 2016; Adenle et al., 2017).
National governments or international organizations may motivate
urban adaptation externally through broad policy directives or projects
by international donors. Municipal governments on the other hand
work within the city to spur progress on adaptation. Individual political
leadership in municipal government, for example, has been cited as
a factor driving the adaptation policies of early adapters in Quito,
Ecuador, and Durban, and South Africa (Anguelovski et al., 2014),
and for adaptation more generally (Smith et al, 2009). Adaptation
pathways can help identify maladaptive actions (Juhola et al, 2016;
Magnan et al., 2016; Gajjar et al., 2018) and encourage social learning
approaches across multiple levels of stakeholders in sectors such as
marine biodiversity and water supply (Bosomworth et al., 2015; Butler

"Multilevel governance includes adaptation across local, regional, and
national scales (Adger et al., 2005). The whole-of-government approach
to understanding and influencing climate change policy design and
implementation puts analytical emphasis on how different levels of
government and different types of actors (e.g., public and private)
can constrain or support local adaptive capacity (Corfee-Morlot et al.,
2011), including the role of the civil society. National governments,
for example, have been associated with enhancing adaptive capacity
through building awareness of climate impacts, encouraging economic
growth, providing incentives, establishing legislative frameworks
conducive to adaptation, and communicating climate change
information (Berrang-Ford et al., 2014; Massey et al., 2014; Austin et al.,
2015; Henstra, 2016; Massey and Huitema, 2016). Local governments,
on the other hand, are responsible for delivering basic services and
utilities to the urban population, and protecting their integrity from
the impacts of extreme weather (Austin et al., 2015; Cloutier et al.,
2015; Nalau et al, 2015; Araos et al, 2016b). National policies and
transnational governance could be seen as complementary, rather
than competitors, and strong national policies favour transnational
engagement of sub- and non-state actors (Andonova et al., 2017).
Local initiatives are complementary with higher level policies and can
be integrated in the multilevel governance system (Fuhr et al., 2018).

The Danube River Protection Convention is the official instrument for cooperation on transboundary water governance between
the countries that share the Danube Basin. The International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR) provides
a strong science—policy link through expert working groups dealing with issues including governance, monitoring and assessment,
and flood protection (Schmeier, 2014). The Trans-National Monitoring Network (TNMN) was developed to undertake comprehensive
monitoring of water quality (Schmeier, 2014). Monitoring of water quality constitutes almost 50% of ICPDR’s scientific publications,
although ICPDR also works on governance, basin planning, monitoring, and IWRM, indicating its importance. The ICPDR is an

The governments sharing the Limpopo river basin (Botswana, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe) formed the Limpopo
Watercourse Commission in 2003 (Nyagwambo et al., 2008; Mitchell, 2013). It has an advisory body composed of working groups
that assess water use and sustainability, decide national level distribution of water access, and support disaster and emergency
planning. The Limpopo basin delta is highly vulnerable (Tessler et al., 2015), and is associated with a lack of infrastructure and
investment capacity, requiring increased economic development together with plans for vulnerability reduction (Tessler et al.,
2015) and water rights (Swatuk, 2015). The high vulnerability is influenced by gender inequality, limited stakeholder participation
and limited institutional capacity to address unequal water access (Mehta et al., 2014). The implementation of integrated water
resources management (IWRM) would need to consider pre-existing social, economic, historical and cultural contexts (Merrey,
2009; Mehta et al., 2014). The Commission therefore could play a role in improving participation and in providing an adaptable and
equitable strategy for cross-border water sharing (Ekblom et al., 2017).

global emission projections resulting from full implementation of the NDCs represent an improvement compared to business as
usual (Rogelj et al., 2016) and current policies scenarios to 2030 (den Elzen et al., 2016; Vrontisi et al., 2018). Most G20 economies

traditional biomass use is accounted for. Additionally, there are land-use mitigation uncertainties (Forsell et al., 2016; Grassi et al.,

frameworks based on six effort sharing categories in the ARS (Clarke et al., 2014) with the principles of ‘responsibility’, ‘capability’
and ‘equity’ (Hohne et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2017; Robiou du Pont et al., 2017). There is an important methodological gap in
the assessment of the NDCs’ fairness and equity implications, partly due to lack of information on countries’ own assessments
(Winkler et al., 2017). Implementation of Article 2.2 of the Paris Agreement could reflect equity and the principle of ‘common but
differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities’, due to different national circumstances and different interpretations of
equity principles (Lahn and Sundqvist, 2017; Lahn, 2018).

pathways could be avoided if emissions are limited to below 50 GtCO,-eq yr"" in 2030 (here computed with the GWP-100 metric
of the IPCC SAR). New scenario studies show that full implementation of the NDCs by 2030 would imply the need for deeper and
faster emission reductions beyond 2030 in order to meet 2°C, and also higher costs and efforts of negative emissions (Fujimori et
al., 2016; Sanderson et al., 2016; Rose et al., 2017; van Soest et al, 2017; Luderer et al., 2018). However, no flexibility has been found
for 1.5°C-consistent pathways (Luderer et al., 2016; Rogelj et al., 2017), indicating that if emissions through 2030 are at NDC levels,
the resulting post-2030 reductions required to remain within a 1.5°C-consistent carbon budget during the 21st century (Chapter 2,
Section 2.2) are not within the feasible operating space of IAMs. This indicates that the chances of failing to reach a 1.5°C pathway

the level of adaptation ambition required to deal with the consequent risks and impacts (Rajamani, 2016). Countries can include
domestic adaptation goals in their NDCs, which together with national adaptation plans (NAPs) give countries flexibility to design
and adjust their adaptation trajectories as their needs evolve and as progress is evaluated over time. A challenge for assessing
progress on adaptation globally is the aggregation of many national adaptation actions and approaches. Knowledge gaps still
remain about how to design measurement frameworks that generate and integrate national adaptation data without placing undue
burdens on countries (UNEP, 2017a).

"The Paris Agreement stipulates that adaptation communications shall be submitted as a component of or in conjunction with
other communications, such as an NDC, a NAP, or a national communication. Of the 197 Parties to the UNFCCC, 140 NDCs have
an adaptation component, almost exclusively from developing countries. NDC adaptation components could be an opportunity
for enhancing adaptation planning and implementation by highlighting priorities and goals (Kato and Ellis, 2016). At the national
level they provide momentum for the development of NAPs and raise the profile of adaptation (Pauw et al., 2016b, 2018). The Paris
Agreement's transparency framework includes adaptation, through which ‘adaptation communication’ and accelerated adaptation
actions are submitted and reviewed every five years (Hermwille, 2016; Kato and Ellis, 2016). This framework, unlike others used in
the past, is applicable to all countries taking into account differing capacities amongst Parties (Rajamani, 2016).

These indicators are relevant but would need continuous assessment if their continued reliability is to be confirmed (Nyong et al.,

2014). Increased climate variability has raised concerns about the reliability of these indicators (Shaffer, 2014); therefore, initiatives
have focused on the co-production of knowledge by involving local communities in monitoring and discussing the implications of
indigenous knowledge and meteorological forecasts (Shaffer, 2014), and creating local forecasts by utilizing the two sources of
knowledge (Mahoo et al., 2013). This has resulted in increased documentation of indigenous knowledge, understanding of relevant
climate information amongst stakeholders, and adaptive capacity at the community level (Mahoo et al., 2013, 2015; Shaffer, 2014).

from a cyclone or drought (McNamara and Prasad, 2014; Granderson, 2017; Pearce et al., 2017). Social cohesion and kinship are
important in responding and preparing for climate-related hazards, including the role of resource sharing, communal labour, and
remittances (McMillen et al, 2014; Gawith et al. 2016; Granderson, 2017). There is a concern that indigenous knowledge will
weaken, a process driven by westernization and disruptions in established bioclimatic indicators and traditional planning calendars
(Granderson, 2017). In some urban settlements, it has been noted that cultural practices (e.g., prioritizing the quantity of food over
the quality of food) can lower food security through dispersing limited resources and by encouraging the consumption of cheap
but nutrient-poor foods (Mccubbin et al., 2017) (See Cross-Chapter Box 6 on Food Security in Chapter 3). Indigenous practices also

"One of the novel features of the new climate governance architecture
emerging from the 2015 Paris Agreement is the transparency
framework in Article 13 committing countries, based on capacity,
to provide regular progress reports on national pledges to address
climate change (UNFCCC, 2016). Many countries will rely on public
policies and existing national reporting channels to deliver on their
NDCs under the Paris Agreement. Scaling up the mitigation and
adaptation efforts in these countries to be consistent with 1.5°C
would put significant pressure on the need to develop, enhance and
streamline local, national and international climate change reporting
and monitoring methodologies and institutional capacity in relation
to mitigation, adaptation, finance, and GHG inventories (Ford et al.,
2015b; Lesnikowski et al., 2015; Schoenefeld et al., 2016). Consistent
with this direction, the provision of the information to the stocktake
under Article 14 of the Paris Agreement would contribute to enhancing
reporting and transparency (UNFCCC, 2016). Nonetheless, approaches,
reporting procedures, reference points, and data sources to assess
progress on implementation across and within nations are still largely
underdeveloped (Ford et al, 2015b; Araos et al, 2016b; Magnan and
Ribera, 2016; Lesnikowski et al., 2017). The availability of independent
private and public reporting and statistical institutions are integral to
oversight, effective monitoring, reporting and review. The creation and
enhancement of these institutions would be an important contribution
to an effective transition to a low-emission world.
"	Text
"IPCCARS assessed that in order to enable a transition to a 2°C pathway,
the volume of climate investments would need to be transformed along
with changes in the pattern of general investment behaviour towards
low emissions. The report argued that, compared to 2012, annually up
to a trillion dollars in additional investment in low-emission energy and
energy efficiency measures may be required until 2050 (Blanco et al.,
2014; IEA, 2014a). Financing of 1.5°C would present an even greater
challenge, addressing financing of both existing and new assets, which
would require significant transitions to the type and structure of financial
institutions as well as to the method of financing (Cochrani et al., 2014;
Ma, 2014). Both public and private financial institutions would be needed
to contribute to the large resource mobilization needed for 1.5°C, yet, in
the ordinary course of business, these transitions may not be expected.
On the one hand, private financial institutions could face scale-up risk,
for example, the risks associated with commercialization and scaling
up of renewable technologies to accelerate mitigation (Wilson, 2012;
Hartley and Medlock, 2013) and/or price risk, such as carbon price
volatility that carbon markets could face. In contrast, traditional public
financial institutions are limited by both structure and instruments, while
concessional financing would require taxpayer support for subsidization.
Special efforts and innovative approaches would be needed to address
these challenges, for example the creation of special institutions that
underwrite the value of emission reductions using auctioned price floors
(Bodnar et al., 2018) to deal with price volatility.

"Some indigenous populations believe it is arrogant to predict the
future, and some cultures have belief systems that interpret natural
phenomena as sentient, where thoughts and words are believed to
influence the future, with people reluctant to talk about negative future
possibilities (Natcher et al., 2007; Flynn et al., 2018). Integrating these
considerations into the design of adaptation and mitigation policy is
important (Cochran et al., 2013; Chapin et al, 2016; Brugnach et al.,

"People are more prone to act on climate change when individual benefits
of actions exceed costs (Steg and Vlek, 2009; Kardooni et al. 2016;
Wolske et al., 2017). For this reason, people generally prefer adoption of
energy-efficient appliances above energy-consumption reductions; the
latter is perceived as more costly (Poortinga et al., 2003; Steg et al.,
2006), although transaction costs can inhibit the uptake of mitigation
technology (Mundaca, 2007). Decentralized renewable energy systems
are evaluated most favourably when they guarantee independence,
autonomy, control and supply security (Ecker et al., 2017).

"Knowledge of the causes and consequences of climate change and
of ways to reduce GHG emissions is not always accurate (Bord et al.,

climate actions, even when people would be motivated to act. For
example, people overestimate savings from low-energy activities,
and underestimate savings from high-energy activities (Attari et al.,
2010). They know little about ‘embodied’ energy (ie, energy needed
to produce products; Tobler et al, 2011), including meat (de Boer et

"Ability to engage in climate action. Individuals more often engage
in adaptation (Gebrehiwot and van der Veen, 2015; Koerth et al.,
2017) and mitigation behaviour (Pisano and Lubell, 2017) when they
are or feel more capable to do so. Hence, it is important to enhance
ability to act on climate change, which depends on income and
knowledge, among other things. A higher income is related to higher
CO, emissions; higher income groups can afford more carbon-intensive
lifestyles (Lamb et al., 2014; Dietz et al, 2015; Wang et al., 2015). Yet
low-income groups may lack resources to invest in energy-efficient
technology and refurbishments (Andrews-Speed and Ma, 2016) and
adaptation options (Wamsler, 2007; Fleming et al., 2015b; Takahashi et
al., 2016). Adaptive capacity further depends on gender roles (Jabeen,

(Feola et al, 2015; Eakin et al. 2016; Singh et al., 2016b).

"Motivation to engage in climate action. Climate actions are
more strongly related to motivational factors than to knowledge,
reflecting individuals’ reasons for actions, such as values, ideology
and worldviews (Hornsey et al., 2016). People consider various types
of costs and benefits of actions (Gélz and Hahnel, 2016) and focus
on consequences that have implications for the values they find most
important (Dietz et al. 2013; Hahnel et al., 2015; Steg, 2016). This
implies that different individuals consider different consequences when
making choices. People who strongly value protecting the environment
and other people generally more strongly consider climate impacts and
act more on climate change than those who strongly endorse hedonic
and egoistic values (Taylor et al., 2014; Steg, 2016). People are more
prone to adopt sustainable innovations when they are more open to
new ideas (Jansson, 2011; Wolske et al., 2017). Further, a free-market
ideology is associated with weaker climate change beliefs (McCright
and Dunlap, 2011; Hornsey et al. 2016), and a capital-oriented culture
tends to promote activity associated with GHG emissions (Kasser et

are remembered more than low impact regular events (Meze-Hausken,
2004; Singh et al., 2016b; Sullivan-Wiley and Short Gianotti, 2017).
Personal experience with climate hazards strengthens motivation to
protect oneself (Jabeen, 2014) and enhances adaptation actions (Bryan
et al, 2009; Berrang-Ford et al., 2011; Demski et al., 2017), although
this does not always translate into proactive adaptation (Taylor et
al., 2014). Collectively constructed notions of risk and expectations
of future climate variability shape risk perception and adaptation
behaviour (Singh et al., 2016b). People with particular political views
and those who emphasize individual autonomy may reject climate
science knowledge and believe that there is widespread scientific
disagreement about climate change (Kahan, 2010; O'Neill et al. 2013),
inhibiting support for climate policy (Ding et al., 2011; McCright et al.,

preparedness to reduce energy use among left- but not right-leaning

than gains (Kahneman, 2003). Perceived gains and losses depend on
the reference point or status-quo (Kahneman, 2003). Loss aversion
and the status-quo bias prevent consumers from switching electricity

and Katsikopoulos, 2008; Dinner et al., 2011). Uncertainty and loss
aversion lead consumers to undervalue future energy savings (Greene,
2011) and savings from energy efficient technologies (Kolstad et al.,
2014). Uncertainties about the performance of products and illiquidity
of investments can drive consumers to postpone (profitable) energy-
efficient investments (Sutherland, 1991; van Soest and Bulte, 2001).
People with a higher tendency to delay decisions may engage less
in energy saving actions (Lillemo, 2014). Training energy auditors in
loss-aversion increased their clients’ investments in energy efficiency
improvements (Gonzales et al., 1988). Engagement in energy saving
and renewable energy programmes can be enhanced if participation is
set as a default option (Pichert and Katsikopoulos, 2008; Olander and
Thagersen, 2014; Ebeling and Lotz, 2015).

"Individuals can follow heuristics, or ‘rules of thumb’, in making
inferences, which demand less cognitive resources, knowledge
and time than thinking through all implications of actions (Preston
et al., 2013; Frederiks et al., 2015; Gillingham and Palmer, 2017).
For example, people tend to think that larger and more visible
appliances use more energy, which is not always accurate (Cowen
and Gatersleben, 2017). They underestimate energy used for water
heating and overestimate energy used for lighting (Stern, 2014).
When facing choice overload, people may choose the easiest or first
available option, which can inhibit energy-saving behaviour (Stern
and Gardner, 1981; Frederiks et al., 2015). As a result, individuals
and firms often strive for satisficing (‘good enough’) outcomes with
regard to energy decisions (Wilson and Dowlatabadi, 2007; Klotz,
2011), which can inhibit investments in energy efficiency (Decanio,
1993; Frederiks et al., 2015).

"Furthermore, collective consequences affect climate actions
(Balcombe et al., 2013; Déci and Vasileiadou, 2015; Kastner and
Stern, 2015). People are motivated to see themselves as morally
right, which encourages mitigation actions (Steg et al., 2015),
particularly when long-term goals are salient (Zaval et al., 2015) and
behavioural costs are not too high (Diekmann and Preisendorfer,
2003). Individuals are more prone to engage in climate actions when
they believe climate change is occurring, when they are aware of
threats caused by climate change and by their inaction, and when
they think they can engage in actions that will reduce these threats
(Esham and Garforth, 2013; Arunrat et al., 2017; Chatrchyan et al.,
2017). The more individuals are concerned about climate change and
aware of the negative climate impact of their behaviour, the more
they feel responsible for their actions and think that their actions can
help reduce such negative impacts, which can strengthen their moral
norms to act accordingly (Steg and de Groot, 2010; Jakovcevic and
Steg, 2013; Chen, 2015; Ray et al., 2017; Wolske et al., 2017; Woods
et al., 2017). Individuals may engage in mitigation actions when
they see themselves as supportive of the environment (ie., strong
environmental self-identity) (Fielding et al., 2008; van der Werff et
al., 2013b; Kashima et al, 2014; Barbarossa et al., 2017); a strong
environmental identity strengthens intrinsic motivation to engage
in mitigation actions both at home (van der Werff et al., 2013a)
and at work (Ruepert et al., 2016). Environmental self-identity is
strengthened when people realize they have engaged in mitigation
actions, which can in turn promote further mitigation actions (van der
Werff et al., 2014b).

is conditional upon a successful bid (via auctioning) (Chu, 2015), costing about 50,000 USD in 2014 (LTA, 2015). The registration
tax incentivizes purchases of low-emission vehicles via a feebate system. As a result, per capita transport emissions (approximately
1.25 tCO.yr-') and car ownership (107 vehicles per 1000 capita) (LTA, 2017) are substantially lower than in cities with comparable
income levels. Modal share of public transport was 63% during peak hours in 2013 (LTA, 2013).

bus network (80%), cycling facilities, and road safety measures (Leape, 2006). The number of cars entering the zone decreased by
18% in 2003 and 2004. In the charging zone, vehicle kilometres driven decreased by 15% in the first year and a further 6% a year

a focus on environmental considerations and weaken intrinsic
motivation to engage in climate action (Evans et al., 2012; Agrawal
et al. 2015; Schwartz et al, 2015). In addition, pursuing small
financial gains is perceived to be less worth the effort than pursuing
equivalent CO, emission reductions (Bolderdijk et al., 2013b; Dogan

(e.g., to improve energy efficiency) because they do not trust the

"The Stockholm congestion charge implemented in 2007 (after a trial in 2006) reduced kilometres driven in the inner city by 16%, and
outside the city by 5%; traffic volumes reduced by 20% and remained constant over time despite economic and population growth
(Eliasson, 2014). CO, emissions from traffic reduced by 2-3% in Stockholm county. Vehicles entering or leaving the city centre
were charged during weekdays (except for holidays). Charges were 1-2€ (maximum 6€ per day), being higher during peak hours;
taxis, emergency vehicles and buses were exempted. Before introducing the charge, public transport and parking places near mass
transit stations were extended. The aim and effects of the charge were extensively communicated to the public. Acceptability of the
congestion charge was initially low, but the scheme gained support of about two-thirds of the population and all political parties
after it was implemented (Eliasson, 2014), which may be related to the fact that the revenues were earmarked for constructing
a motorway tunnel. After the trial, people believed that the charge had more positive effects on environmental, congestion and
parking problems while costs increased less than they anticipated beforehand (Schuitema et al., 2010a). The initially hostile media

ameliorate impacts, rather than just providing information on climate
projections with little meaning to end users (e.g., weather forecasts,

not involve social interaction, such as social norm, social comparison
and group feedback, are less effective, but can be easily administered

"Goal setting can promote mitigation action when goals are not set

particularly when individuals also indicate how and when they will
perform the relevant action and anticipate how to cope with possible
barriers (i.e., implementation intentions) (Bamberg, 2000, 2002). Such
strategies take advantage of individuals’ desire to be consistent (Steg,

Tailored information prevents information overload, and people are
more motivated to consider and act upon information that aligns with
their core values and beliefs (Campbell and Kay, 2014; Hornsey et al.,

when provided in real-time or immediately after the action (Abrahamse

"Actions that reduce climate risks can be rewarded and facilitated, while

more acceptable than imposed changes that restrict choices (Eriksson

maladaptive behaviour can increase vulnerability when they reinforce
socio-economic inequalities that typically produce the maladaptive

Climate Summit slightly increased knowledge about the conference

climate change may inhibit action when they make people feel helpless

Endorsement of mitigation and adaptation actions are positively

Strategies that target general antecedents that affect a wide range

ineffective. Moreover, individuals can sometimes engage in behaviour that may be maladaptive over larger spatio-temporal scales.
For example, in the Philippines, many islanders adapt to flooding by elevating their floors using coral stone (Laurice Jamero et

(Ferrario et al., 2014). In Maharashtra, India, on-farm ponds are promoted as rainwater harvesting structures to adapt to dry spells

will partly depend on the progress of GPTs. Governments have
established institutions for achieving many social, and sometimes
conflicting goals, including economic growth and addressing climate
change (OECD, 2017c), which include investment in basic research
and development (R&D) that can help develop game-changing
technologies (Shayegh et al, 2017). Governments are also needed
to create an enabling environment for the growth of scientific and
technological ecosystems necessary for GPT development (Tassey,
2014).

"While literature on 1.5°C-specific innovation policy is absent, a growing
body of literature indicates that governments aim to achieve social,
economic and environmental goals by promoting science and a broad
range of technologies through ‘mission-driven’ innovation policies,
based on differentiated national priorities (Edler and Fagerberg,
2017). Governments can play a role in advancing climate technology
via a ‘technology push’ policy on the technology supply side (eg.,
R&D subsidies), and by ‘demand pull’ policy on the demand side (e.g.,
energy-efficiency regulation), and these policies can be complemented
by enabling environments (Somanathan et al., 2014). Governments may
also play a role in removing existent support for incumbents (Kivimaa
and Kern, 2016). A growing literature indicates that policy mixes, rather
than single policy instruments, are more effective in addressing climate
innovation challenges ranging from technologies in the R&D phase to
those ready for diffusion (Veugelers, 2012; Quitzow, 2015; Rogge et al.,
2017; Rosenow et al., 2017). Such innovation policies can help address
two kinds of externalities: environmental externalities and proprietary
problems (GEA, 2012; IPCC, 2014b; Mazzucato and Semieniuk, 2017).To
avoid ‘picking winners’, governments often maintain a broad portfolio

they have to be conducted carefully by governments and institutions

"The use of sugarcane as a bioenergy source started in Brazil in the 1970s. Government and multinational car factories modified
car engines nationwide so that vehicles running only on ethanol could be produced. As demand grew, production and distribution
systems matured and costs came down (Soccol et al., 2010). After a transition period in which both ethanol-only and gasoline-only
cars were used, the flex-fuel era started in 2003, when all gasoline was blended with 25% ethanol (de Freitas and Kaneko, 2011). By
2010, around 80% of the car fleet in Brazil had been converted to use flex-fuel (Goldemberg, 2011; Su et al., 2015).

"Funding for R&D could come from various sources, including the general
budget, energy or resource taxation, or emission trading schemes (see
Section 4.4.5). Investing in climate-related R&D has as an additional
benefit of building capabilities to implement climate mitigation and
adaptation technologies (Ockwell et al., 2015). Countries regard
innovation in general and climate technology specifically as a national
interests issue and addressing climate change primarily as being in
the global interest. Reframing part of climate policy as technology or
industrial policy might therefore contribute to resolving the difficulties
that continue to plague emission target negotiations (Faehn and

mitigation and adaptation in Article 10 in the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC,

and diffusion, this section focuses on technology transfer. Technology
transfer can adapt technologies to local circumstances, reduce financing
costs, develop indigenous technology, and build capabilities to operate,
maintain, adapt and innovate on technology globally (Ockwell et al.,

"Brazil and the European Union have tried to replicate Brazil's bioethanol experience in climatically suitable African countries.
Although such technology transfer achieved relative success in Angola and Sudan, the attempts to set up bioethanol value chains
did not pass the phase of political deliberations and feasibility studies elsewhere in Africa. Lessons learned include the need for
political and economic stability of the donor country (Brazil) and the necessity for market creation to attract investments in first-
generation biofuels alongside a safe legal and policy environment for improved technologies (Afionis et al., 2014; Favretto et al.,

"Ethanol appears to reduce urban car emission of health-affecting ultrafine particles by 30% compared to gasoline-based cars,
but increases ozone (Salvo et al., 2017). During the 1990s, when sugarcane burning was still prevalent, particulate pollution had
negative consequences for human health and the environment (Ribeiro, 2008; Paraiso and Gouveia, 2015). While Jaiswal et al.
(2017) report bioethanol’s limited impact on food production and forests in Brazil, despite the large scale, and attribute this to
specific agro-ecological zoning legislation, various studies report adverse effects of bioenergy production through forest substitution
by croplands (Searchinger et al., 2008), as well as impacts on biodiversity, water resources and food security (Rathore et al., 2016).

For new generation biofuels, feasibility and life cycle assessment studies can provide information on their impacts on environmental,

"More than forty years of combining technology push and market pull measures led to the deployment of ethanol production,
transportation and distribution systems across Brazil, leading to a significant decrease in CO, emissions (Macedo et al., 2008).
Examples of innovations include: (i) the development of environmentally well-adapted varieties of sugarcane; (ii) the development
and scaling up of sugar fermentation in a non-sterile environment, and (iii) the development of adaptations of car engines to use
ethanol as a fuel in isolation or in combination with gasoline (Amorim et al., 2011; de Freitas and Kaneko, 2011; De Souza et al.,
2014). Public procurement, public investment in R&D and mandated fuel blends accompanying these innovations were also crucial
(Hogarth, 2017). In the future, innovation could lead to viable partial CO, removal through deployment of BECCS associated with
the bioethanol refineries (Fuss et al., 2014; Rochedo et al., 2016) (see Section 4.3.7).

"Most technology transfer is driven by through markets by the
interests of technology seekers and technology holders, particularly
in regions with well-developed institutional and technological

transfer landscape has gaps, in particular in reaching out to least-
developed countries, where institutional and technology capabilities
are limited (de Coninck and Puig, 2015; Ockwell and Byrne, 2016).
On the one hand, literature suggests that the management or even
monitoring of all these UN, bilateral, private and public initiatives
may fail to lead to better results. On the other hand, it is probably
more cost-effective to adopt a strategy of ‘letting a thousand flowers
bloom’, by challenging and enticing researchers in the public and
the private sector to direct innovation towards low-emission and
adaptation options (Haselip et al. 2015). This can be done at the

"The mean incremental share of annual energy investments to stay well below 2°C is 0.36% (between 0.2-1%) of global GDP
between 2016 and 2035. Since total world investment (also called gross fixed capital formation (GFCF)) is about 24% of global
GDP, the estimated incremental energy investments between a baseline and a 1.5°C transition would be approximately 1.5%
(between 0.8-4.2%) of projected total world investments. As the higher ends of these ranges reflect pessimistic assumptions
in 1.5°C-consistent pathways on technological change, the implementation of policies to accelerate technical change (see the
remainder of Section 4.4.5) could lower the probability of higher incremental investment.

"If we assume the amounts of investments given by the OECD for transportation and other infrastructure for warming of 2°C to be
a lower limit for an 1.5°C pathway, then total incremental investments for all sectors for a 1.5°C-consistent pathway would be
estimated at 2.4% of total world investments. This total incremental investment reaches 2.53% if the investments in transportation
are scaled up proportionally with the investments in the energy sector and if all other investments are kept constant. Comparing this
2.4% or 2.53% number for all sectors to the 1.5% number for energy only (see previous paragraph) suggests that the investments in
sectors other than energy contribute significantly to incremental world investments, even though a comprehensive study or estimate
of these investments for a 1.5°C limit is not available.

"Since the financial system has limited fungibility across budget lines, changing the partitioning of investments is not a zero-sum
game. An effective policy regime could encourage investment managers to change their asset allocation. Part of the challenge may
lie in increasing the pace of financing of low-emission assets to compensate for a possible 38% decrease, by 2035, in the value of
fossil fuel assets (energy sector and indirect holdings in downstream uses like automobiles) (Mercure et al., 2018).

"The interplay between mechanisms of financial intermediation
and the private risk-return calculus is a major barrier to realizing
these investments (Sirkis et al., 2015). This obstacle is not specific to
climate mitigation investments but also affects infrastructure and
has been characterised as the gap between the ‘propensity to save’
and the ‘propensity to invest’ (Summers, 2016). The issue is whether
new financial instruments could close this gap and inject liquidity
into the low-emission transition, thereby unlocking new economic

scenarios, about three times the incremental investments is redirected. There is no such assessment for the other sectors. The OECD
report suggests that these ratios might be higher.

overall sustainable development and poverty-alleviation investments

change damages is related to pre-existing fragility of impacted
societies (Hallegatte et al., 2007). Enhancing infrastructure and service
provision would lower this fragility, for example, through the provision
of universal (water, sanitation, telecommunication) service access
(Arezki et al., 2016).

"The main challenge is thus not just a lack of mobilization of aggregate
resources but of redirection of savings towards infrastructure, and
the further redirection of these infrastructure investments towards
low-emission options. If emission-free assets emerge fast enough to
compensate for the devaluation of high-emission assets, the sum of
the required incremental and redirected investments in the energy
sector would (up to 2035) be equivalent to between 3.3% and 5.3%
of the average annual revenues of the private capital stock (see Box
4.8) and to between 5.6% and 8.3%, including all infrastructure
investments.
"	Text
"These orders of magnitude of investment can be compared to the available statistics of the global stock of 386 trillion USD of
financial capital, which consists of 100 trillion USD in bonds (SIFMA, 2017), around 60 trillion USD in equity (World Bank, 2018b),
and 226 trillion USD of loans managed by the banking system (IIF, 2017; World Bank, 2018a). The long-term rate of return (interest
plus increase of shareholder value) is about 3% on bonds, 5% on bank lending and 7% on equity, leading to a weighted mean return
on capital of 3.4% in real terms (5.4% in nominal terms). Using 3.4% as a lower bound and 5% as a higher bound (following Piketty,
2014) and taking a conservative assumption that global financial capital grows at the same rate as global GDP, the estimated yearly
financial capital revenues would be between 16.8 and 25.4 trillion USD.

"These figures are consistent with the dramatic reduction in the unit
costs of some low-emission technical options (for example solar
PV, LED lighting) over the past decade (see Section 4.3.1) (OECD,
2017c). Yet there are multiple constraints to a system-wide energy
transition. Lower costs of some supply- and demand-side options do
not always result in a proportional decrease in energy system costs.
The adoption of alternative options can be slowed down by increasing
costs of decommissioning existing infrastructure, the inertia of market
structures, cultural habits and risk-adverse user behaviour (see Sections
4.4.1 to 4.4.3). Learning-by-doing processes and R&D can accelerate
the cost-efficiency of low-emission technology but often imply higher
early-phase costs. The German energy transition resulted in high
consumer prices for electricity in Germany (Kreuz and Mlisgens, 2017)
and needed strong accompanying measures to succeed.

grounded only in regulation, standards and public funding of R&D is

which could raise the costs of implementation. This literature has argued
that it may be more efficient to make these costs explicit through carbon
taxes and carbon trading, securing the abatement of emissions in places
and sectors where it is cheapest (IPCC, 1995, 2001; Gupta et al., 2007;

"Strengthening policy instruments for a low-emission transition would
thus need to reconcile three objectives: (i) handling the short-term
frictions inherent to this transition in an equitable way, (ii) minimizing
these frictions by lowering the cost of avoided GHGs emissions, and (iii)
coordinating expectations of multiple stakeholders at various decision-
making levels to accelerate the decline in costs of emission reduction,
efficiency and decoupling options and maximizing their co-benefits
(see the practical example of lowering car use in cities in Box 4.9).

"Asecond matter of concern is the distortion of international competition
and employment implications in the case of uneven carbon constraints,
especially for energy-intensive industries (Demailly and Quirion, 2008).
Some of these industries are not highly exposed to international
competition because of their very high transportation costs per unit
value added (Sartor, 2013; Branger et al., 2016), but other industries
could suffer severe shocks, generate ‘carbon leakage’ through cheaper
imports from countries with lower carbon constraints (Branger and
Quirion, 2014), and weaken the surrounding regional industrial fabric
with economy-wide and employment implications.

"In a frictionless world, a uniform world carbon price could minimize the
social costs of the low-carbon transition by equating the marginal costs
of abatement across all sources of emissions. This implies that investors
will be able to make the right choices under perfect foresight and that
domestic and international compensatory transfers offset the adverse
distributional impacts of higher energy prices and their consequences on
economic activity. In the absence of such transfers, carbon prices would
have to be differentiated by jurisdiction (Chichilnisky and Heal, 2000;
Sheeran, 2006; Bohringer et al., 2009; Bohringer and Alexeeva-Talebi,

prices has a proportionally greater impact in developing countries
that are in a catch-up phase, as they have a stronger dependence on
energy-intensive sectors (Crassous et al., 2006; Luderer et al, 2012)
and a higher ratio of energy to labour cost (Waisman et al., 2012). This
explains why with lower carbon prices, similar emission reductions are
reached in South Africa (Altieri et al., 2016) and Brazil (La Rovere et al.,
2017a) compared to developed countries. However, three distributional
issues emerge.
"	Text
"Obstacles to enforcing a uniform world carbon price in the short run
would not necessarily crowd out explicit national carbon pricing, for
three reasons. First, a uniform carbon price would limit an emissions
rebound resulting from a higher consumption of energy services
enabled by efficiency gains, if energy prices do not change (Greening et
al., 2000; Fleurbaey and Hammond, 2004; Sorrell et al., 2009; Guivarch
and Hallegatte, 2011; Chitnis and Sorrell, 2015; Freire-Gonzalez, 2017).
Second, it could hedge against the arbitrariness of regulatory policies.
Third, ‘revenue neutral’ recycling, at a constant share of taxes on GDP,
into lowering some existing taxes would compensate for at least part
of the propagation effect of higher energy costs (Stiglitz et al, 2017).
The substitution by carbon taxes of taxes that cause distortions on the

"A third challenge is the depreciation of assets whose value is based on
the valuation of fossil energy resources, of which future revenues may
decline precipitously with higher carbon prices (Waisman et al., 2013;
Jakob and Hilaire, 2015; McGlade and Ekins, 2015), and on emission-
intensive capital stocks (Guivarch and Hallegatte, 2011; OECD, 2015a;
Pfeiffer et al., 2016). This raises issues of changes in industrial structure,
adaptation of worker skills, and of stability of financial, insurance and
social security systems. These systems are in part based on current
holdings of carbon-based assets whose value might decrease by about
38% by the mid-2030s (Mercure et al. 2018). This stranded asset
challenge may be exacerbated by a decline of export revenues of fossil
fuel producing countries and regions (Waisman et al., 2013; Jakob and
Hilaire, 2015; McGlade and Ekins, 2015).
"	Text
"First, in the absence of countervailing policies, higher energy costs
have an adverse effect on the distribution of welfare (see also
Chapter 5). The negative impact is inversely correlated with the
level of income (Harberger, 1984; Fleurbaey and Hammond, 2004)
and positively correlated with the share of energy in the households
budget, which is high for low- and middle-income households
(Proost and Van Regemorter, 1995; Barker and Kohler, 1998; West
and Williams, 2004; Chiroleu-Assouline and Fodha, 2011). Moreover,
climatic conditions and the geographical conditions of human
settlements matter for heating and mobility needs (see Chapter 5).
Medium-income populations in the suburbs, in remote areas, and in
low-density regions can be as vulnerable as residents of low-income
urban areas. Poor households with low levels of energy consumption
are also impacted by price increases of non-energy goods caused by
the propagation of energy costs (Combet et al., 2010; Dubois, 2012).
These impacts are generally not offset by non-market co-benefits of
climate policies for the poor (Baumgartner et al., 2017).

"4.4.5.3 Regulatory measures and information flows
"	Title
"Regulatory instruments are a common tool for improving energy
efficiency and enhancing renewable energy in OECD countries (e.g., the
USA, Japan, Korea, Australia, the EU) and, more recently, in developing
countries (M.J. Scott et al, 2015; Brown et al., 2017). Such instruments
include constraints on the import of products banned in other countries
(Knoop and Lechtenbohmer, 2017).
"	Text
"These considerations apply to attempts to secure a minimum price in
carbon trading systems (Wood and Jotzo, 2011; Fell et al., 2012; Fuss
et al, 2018) and to the reduction of fossil fuel subsidies. Estimated at
650 billion USD in 2015 (Coady et al., 2017), these subsidies represent
25-30% of government expenditures in forty (mostly developing)
countries (IEA, 2014b). Reducing these subsidies would contribute to
reaching 1.5°C-consistent pathways, but raises similar issues as carbon
pricing around long-term benefits and short-term costs (Jakob et al.,
2015; Zeng and Chen, 2016), as well as social impacts.
"	Text
"For energy efficiency, these instruments include end-use standards and
labelling for domestic appliances, lighting, electric motors, water heaters
and air-conditioners. They are often complemented by mandatory
efficiency labels to attract consumers’ attention and stimulate the
manufacture of more efficient products (Girod et al., 2017). Experience
shows that these policy instruments are effective only if they are
regularly reviewed to follow technological developments, as in the ‘Top
Runner’ programme for domestic appliances in Japan (Sunikka-Blank
and Iwafune, 2011).
"	Text
"In four countries, efficiency standards (e.g. miles per gallon or level of
CO, emission per kilometre) have been used in the transport sector,
for light- and heavy-duty vehicles, which have spillovers for the global
car industry. In the EU (Ajanovic and Haas, 2017) and the USA (Sen
et al, 2017), vehicle manufacturers need to meet an annual CO,
emission target for their entire new vehicle fleet. This allows them to
compensate through the introduction of low-emission vehicles for the
high-emission ones in the fleet. This leads to increasingly efficient fleets
of vehicles over time but does not necessarily limit the driven distance.
"	Text
"In every country the design of carbon pricing policy implies a balance
between incentivizing low-carbon behaviour and mitigating the
adverse distributional consequences of higher energy prices (Combet
et al, 2010). Carbon taxes can offset these effects if their revenues
are redistributed through rebates to poor households. Other options
include the reduction of value-added taxes for basic products or direct
benefit transfers to enable poverty reduction (see Winkler et al. (2017)
for South Africa and Grottera et al. (2016) for Brazil). This is possible
because higher-income households pay more in absolute terms, even
though their carbon tax burden is a relatively smaller share of their
income (Arze del Granado et al., 2012).
"	Text
"Building codes that prescribe efficiency requirements for new and
existing buildings have been adopted in many OECD countries (Evans
et al., 2017) and are regularly revised to increase their efficiency per
unit of floor space. Building codes can avoid locking rapidly urbanizing
countries into poorly performing buildings that remain in use for the
next 50-100 years (Urge-Vorsatz et al., 2014). In OECD countries,
however, their main role is to incentivize the retrofit of existing
buildings. In addition of the convergence of these codes to net zero
energy buildings (D'Agostino, 2015), a new focus should be placed,
in the context of 1.5°C-consistent pathways, on public and private
coordination to achieve better integration of building policies with the
promotion of low-emission transportation modes (Bertoldi, 2017).
"	Text
"Explicit carbon prices remain a necessary condition of ambitious
climate policies, and some authors highlight the potential benefit
brought by coordination among groups of countries (Weischer et al.,
2012; Hermwille et al., 2017; Keohane et al., 2017). They could take the
form of carbon pricing corridors (Bhattacharya et al., 2015). They are
a necessary ‘lubricant’ through fiscal reforms or direct compensating
transfers to accommodate the general equilibrium effects of higher
energy prices but may not suffice to trigger the low-carbon transition
because of a persistent ‘implementation gap’ between the aspirational
carbon prices and those that can practically be enforced. When systemic
changes, such as those needed for 1.5°C-consistent pathways, are at
play on many dimensions of development, price levels ‘depend on the
path and the path depends on political decisions’ (Dréze and Stern,
1990).
"	Text
"The efficacy of regulatory instruments can be reinforced by economic
incentives, such as feed-in tariffs based on the quantity of renewable
energy produced, subsidies or tax exemptions for energy savings
(Bertoldi et al., 2013; Ritzenhofen and Spinler, 2016; Garcia-Alvarez et
al. 2017; Pablo-Romero et al., 2017), fee-bates, and ‘bonus-malus’ that
foster the penetration of low-emission options (Butler and Neuhoff,
2008). Economic incentives can also be combined with direct-use
market-based instruments, for example combining, in the United
States and, in some EU countries, carbon trading schemes with energy
savings obligations for energy retailers (Haoqi et al., 2017), or with
green certificates for renewable energy portfolio standards (Upton and
Snyder, 2017). Scholars have investigated caps on utilities’ energy sales
(Thomas et al., 2017) and emission caps implemented at a personal
level (Fawcett et al., 2010).

"Ultimately, the pace of increase of carbon prices would depend on the
pace at which they can be embedded in a consistent set of fiscal and
social policies. This is specifically critical in the context of the 1.5°C
limit (Michaelowa et al., 2018). This is why, after a quarter century of
academic debate and experimentation (see IPCC WGIll reports since
the SAR), a gap persists with respect to ‘switching carbon prices’
needed to trigger rapid changes. In 2016, only 15% of global emissions
are covered by carbon pricing, three-quarters of which with prices
below 10 USD tCO,-* (World Bank, 2016). This is too low to outweigh
the ‘noise’ from the volatility of oil markets (in the range of 100 USD
CO,"" over the past decade), of other price dynamics (interest rates,
currency exchange rates and real estate prices) and of regulatory
policies in energy, transportation and industry. For example, the
dynamics of mobility depend upon a trade-off between housing prices
and transportation costs in which the price of real estate and the inert
endowments in public transport play as important a role as liquid fuel
prices (Lampin et al., 2013).

improved climate-related information alone will enable the financial

indeed a full direct burden on public budgets only in case of default

the COP 21 Decision accompanying the Paris Agreement (paragraph

2011). Although some authors report large savings obtained by such
campaigns, most agree that the effects are short-lived and decrease
over time (Bertoldi et al, 2016). Recently, focus has been placed on the
use of social norms to motivate behavioural changes (Allcott, 2011; Allo

"In combination with the funding of public research institutes, grants
or subsidies also support R&D, where risk and the uncertainty about
long-term perspectives can reduce the private sector's willingness to
invest in low-emission innovation (see also Section 4.4.4). Subsidies can
take the form of rebates on value-added tax (VAT), of direct support to
investments (e.g., renewable energy or refurbishment of buildings) or
feed-in tariffs (Mir-Artigues and del Rio, 2014). They can be provided
by the public budget, via consumption levies, or via the revenues of
carbon taxes or pricing. Fee-bates, introduced in some countries (e.g.,
for cars), have had a neutral impact on public budgets by incentivizing
low-emission products and penalizing high-emission ones (de Haan et
al., 2009).

"The redirection of savings towards low-emission investments may be
constrained by enforceable carbon prices, implementation of technical
standards and the short-term bias of financial systems (Miles, 1993;
Bushee, 2001; Black and Fraser, 2002). The many causes of this bias are
extensively analysed in economic literature (Tehranian and Waegelein,
1985; Shleifer and Vishny, 1990; Bikhchandani and Sharma, 2000),
including their link with prevailing patterns of economic globalization
(Krugman, 2009; Rajan, 2011) and the chronic underinvestment in
long-term infrastructure (IMF, 2014). Emerging literature explores how
to overcome this through reforms targeted to bridge the gap between
short-term cash balances and long-term low-emission assets and to
reduce the risk-weighted capital costs of climate-resilient investments.
This gap, which was qualified by the Governor of the Bank of England as
a ‘tragedy of the horizon’ (Carney, 2016) that constitutes a threat to the
stability of the financial system, is confirmed by the literature (Arezki et
al., 2016; Christophers, 201 7). This potential threat would encompass the
impact of climate events on the value of assets (Battiston et al, 2017),
liability risks (Heede, 2014) and the transition risk due to devaluation of
certain classes of assets (Platinga and Scholtens, 2016).

"The readiness of financial actors to reduce investments in fossil fuels
is a real trend (Platinga and Scholtens, 2016; Ayling and Gunningham,
2017), but they may not resist the attractiveness of carbon-intensive
investments in many regions. Hence, decarbonizing an investment
portfolio is not synonymous with investing massively in low-emission
infrastructure. Scaling up climate-friendly financial products may
depend upon a business context conducive to the reduction of the risk-
weighted capital costs of low-emission projects. The typical leverage of
public funding mechanisms for low-emission investment is low (2 to 4)
compared with other sectors (10 to 15) (Maclean et al., 2008; Ward et
al., 2009; MDB, 2016). This is due to the interplay of the uncertainty of
emerging low-emission technologies in the midst of their learning-by-
doing cycle with uncertain future revenues due to volatility of fossil fuel
prices (Roques et al., 2008; Gross et al, 2010) as well as uncertainty
around regulatory policies. This inhibits low-emission investments by
corporations functioning under a ‘shareholder value business regime’
(Berle and Means, 1932; Roe, 1996; Froud et al., 2000) and actors
with restricted access to capital (e.g. cities, local authorities, SMEs and

that it is very difficult to isolate specific investment needs to enhance

(2016) estimate of investment needs on adaptation in developing

being investment expenditures that are complementary with SDG-

"There is growing attention to the combination of policy instruments
that address three domains of action: behavioural changes, economic
optimization and long-term strategies (Grubb et al., 2014). For example,
de-risking low-emission investments would result in higher volumes of
low-emission investments, and would in turn lead to a lower switching
price for the same climate ambition (Hirth and Steckel, 2016). In the
reverse direction, higher explicit carbon prices may generate more
low-emission projects for a given quantum of de-risking. For example,
efficiency standards for housing can increase the efficacy of carbon prices
and overcome the barriers coming from the high discount rates used by
households (Parry et al., 2014), while explicit and notional carbon prices
can lower the risk of arbitrary standards. The calibration of innovative
financial instruments to notional carbon prices could encourage large
multinational companies to increase their level of internal carbon prices

as a form of a burden-sharing between high-, medium- and low-

"Chapter 2 shows that 1.5°C-consistent pathways involve rapid, global
climate responses to reach net zero emissions by mid-century or earlier.
Chapter 3 identifies climate change risks and impacts to which the
world would need to adapt during these transitions and additional risks
and impacts during potential 1.5°C overshoot pathways. The feasibility
of these pathways is contingent upon systemic change (Section 4.3)
and enabling conditions (Section 4.4), including policy packages. This
section assesses the feasibility of options (technologies, actions and
measures) that form part of global systems under transition that make
up 1.5°C-consistent pathways.

"Even though policy packages depend upon domestic political
processes, they might not reinforce the NDCs at a level consistent with
the 1.5°C transition without a conducive international setting where
international development finance plays a critical role. Section 4.4.1
explores the means of mainstreaming climate finance in the current
evolution of the lending practices of national and multilateral banks
(Badré, 2018). This could facilitate the access of developing countries
to loans via bond markets at low interest rates, encouragement
of the emergence of new business models for infrastructure,
and encouragement of financial markets to support small-scale
investments (Déau and Touati, 2017).

"Following the assessment framework developed in Chapter 1, economic
and technological, institutional and socio-cultural, and environmental and
geophysical feasibility are considered and applied to system transitions
(Sections 4.3.1-4.3.4), overarching adaptation options (Section 4.3.5)
and carbon dioxide removal (CDR) options (Section 4.3.7). This is done
to assess the multidimensional feasibility of mitigation and adaptation
options that have seen considerable development and change since
ARS. In the case of adaptation, the assessed ARS options are typically
clustered. For example, all options related to energy infrastructure
resilience, independently of the generation source, are categorized as
‘resilience of power infrastructure’.
"	Text
"The feasibility assessment takes the following steps. First, each of
the mitigation and adaptation options is assessed along the relevant
indicators grouped around six feasibility dimensions: economic,
technological, institutional, socio-cultural, environmental/ecological
and geophysical. Three types of feasibility groupings were assessed
from the underlying literature: first, if the indicator could block the
feasibility of this option; second, if the indicator has neither a positive
nor a negative effect on the feasibility of the option or the evidence
is mixed; and third, if the indicator does not pose any barrier to the
feasibility of this option. The full assessment of each option under each
indicator, including the literature references on which the assessment
is based, can be found in supplementary materials 4.5M.4.2 and
4.SM.4.3. When appropriate, it is indicated that there is no evidence
(NE), limited evidence (LE) or that the indicator is not applicable to the

Special Report did not have the mandate, space or the literature base

"From Section 4.4, including the case studies presented in the Boxes
4.1 to 4.10, several main messages can be constructed. For instance,
governance would have to be multilevel and engaging different actors,
while being efficient, and choosing the form of cooperation based on
the specific systemic challenge or option at hand. If institutional capacity
for financing and governing the various transitions is not urgently built,
many countries would lack the ability to change pathways from a
high-emission scenario to a low- or zero-emission scenario. In terms of
innovation, governments, both national and multilateral, can contribute

"For land and ecosystem transitions, the options of conservation
agriculture, efficient irrigation, agroforestry, ecosystem restoration

The other options assessed have limited or no evidence across one
or more of the feasibility dimensions. Community-based adaptation
is assessed as having medium evidence and high agreement to face
scaling barriers. Scaling community-based adaptation may require
structural changes, implying the need for transformational adaptation in
some regions. This would involve enhanced multilevel governance and
institutional capacities by enabling anticipatory and flexible decision-
making systems that access and develop collaborative networks
(Dowd et al. 2014), tackling root causes of vulnerability (Chung Tiam
Fook, 2017), and developing synergies between development and
climate change (Burch et al., 2017). Case studies show the use of
transformational adaptation approaches for fire management (Colloff

"There is growing recognition of the need for transformational
adaptation within the agricultural sector but limited evidence on
how to facilitate processes of deep, systemic change (Dowd et al.,
2014). Case studies demonstrate that transformational adaptation in
agriculture requires a sequencing and overlap between incremental and
transformational adaptation actions (Hadarits et al, 2017; Termeer et
al., 2017), e.g., incremental improvements to crop management while
new crop varieties are being researched and field-tested (Rippke et al.,
2016). Broader considerations include addressing stakeholder values
and attitudes (Fleming et al., 2015a), understanding and leveraging the
role of social capital, collaborative networks, and information (Dowd et
al., 2014), and being inclusive with rural and urban communities, and
the social, political, and cultural environment (Rickards and Howden,
2012). Transformational adaptation in agriculture systems could have
significant economic and institutional costs (Mushtaq, 2016), along with
potential unintended negative consequences (Davidson, 2016; Rippke
et al., 2016; Gajjar et al., 2018; Mushtaq, 2018), and a need to focus
on the transitional space between incremental and transformational
adaptation (Hadarits et al., 2017), as well as the timing of the shift from
one to the other (Laderach et al., 2017).

Supplementary Material 4.5M.5.1 provides examples of possible positive
impacts (synergies) and negative impacts (trade-offs) of mitigation
options for adaptation. For example, renewable energy sources such as
wind energy and solar PV combined with electricity storage can increase
resilience due to distributed grids, thereby enhancing both mitigation
and adaptation. Yet, as another example, urban densification may reduce
GHG emissions, enhancing mitigation, but can also intensify heat island
effects and inhibit restoration of local ecosystems if not accounted for,

"Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) in adaptation implementation can
promote accountability and transparency of adaptation financing,
facilitate policy learning and sharing good practices, pressure laggards,
and guide adaptation planning. The majority of research on M&E focuses
on specific policies or programmes, and has typically been driven by
the needs of development organizations, donors, and governments to
measure the impact and attribution of adaptation initiatives (Ford and
Berrang-Ford, 2016). There is growing research examining adaptation
progress across nations, sectors, and scales (Reckien et al, 2014; Araos

adaptation within industrial transitions focusing on the role of
different actors and tools driving innovation, and points to the role
of nationally appropriate mitigation actions in avoiding lock-ins and
promoting system innovation (Boodoo and Olsen, 2017), the role of
private sector in sustainability governance in the socio-political context
(Burch et al., 2016), and of green entrepreneurs driving transformative
change in the green economy (Gibbs and O'Neill, 2014). Lim-Camacho
et al. (2015) suggest an analysis of the complete lifecycle of supply

local enabling environments. The GNHI has been measured twice, in 2010 and 2015, and this showed an increase of 1.8% (CBS &

"Summary: In order to limit warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, the world would need to transform
in a number of complex and connected ways. While transitions towards lower greenhouse gas emissions are
underway in some cities, regions, countries, businesses and communities, there are few that are currently
consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Meeting this challenge would require a rapid escalation in the current
scale and pace of change, particularly in the coming decades. There are many factors that affect the feasibility

of different adaptation and mitigation options that could help limit warming to 1.5°C and with adapting to the
consequences.
"	Text
"Transitional changes are already underway in many systems, but limiting warming to 1.5°C would require a
rapid escalation in the scale and pace of transition, particularly in the next 10-20 years. While limiting warming
to 1.5°C would involve many of the same types of transitions as limiting warming to 2°C, the pace of change
would need to be much faster. While the pace of change that would be required to limit warming to 1.5°C can
be found in the past, there is no historical precedent for the scale of the necessary transitions, in particular in a
socially and economically sustainable way. Resolving such speed and scale issues would require people’s support,
public-sector interventions and private-sector cooperation.
"	Text
"Because these different actions are connected, a ‘whole systems’ approach would be needed for the type of
transformations that could limit warming to 1.5°C. This means that all relevant companies, industries and
stakeholders would need to be involved to increase the support and chance of successful implementation. As
an illustration, the deployment of low-emission technology (e.g., renewable energy projects or a bio-based
chemical plants) would depend upon economic conditions (e.g., employment generation or capacity to mobilize
investment), but also on social/cultural conditions (e.g., awareness and acceptability) and institutional conditions
(e.g., political support and understanding).
"	Text
"There are actions across all sectors that can substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This Special Report
assesses energy, land and ecosystems, urban and infrastructure, and industry in developed and developing
nations to see how they would need to be transformed to limit warming to 1.5°C. Examples of actions include
shifting to low- or zero-emission power generation, such as renewables; changing food systems, such as diet
changes away from land-intensive animal products; electrifying transport and developing ‘green infrastructure’,
such as building green roofs, or improving energy efficiency by smart urban planning, which will change the
layout of many cities.
"	Text
"To limit warming to1.5°C, mitigation would have to be large-scale and rapid. Transitions can be transformative or
incremental, and they often, but not always, go hand in hand. Transformative change can arise from growth in
demand for a new product or market, such that it displaces an existing one. This is sometimes called ‘disruptive
innovation’. For example, high demand for LED lighting is now making more energy-intensive, incandescent
lighting near-obsolete, with the support of policy action that spurred rapid industry innovation. Similarly, smart
phones have become global in use within ten years. But electric cars, which were released around the same
time, have not been adopted so quickly because the bigger, more connected transport and energy systems are
harder to change. Renewable energy, especially solar and wind, is considered to be disruptive by some as it
is rapidly being adopted and is transitioning faster than predicted. But its demand is not yet uniform. Urban
systems that are moving towards transformation are coupling solar and wind with battery storage and electric
vehicles in a more incremental transition, though this would still require changes in regulations, tax incentives,
new standards, demonstration projects and education programmes to enable markets for this system to work.

"FAQ 4.2 | What are Carbon Dioxide Removal and Negative Emissions?
"	Title
"Limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels would require unprecedented rates of transformation
in many areas, including in the energy and industrial sectors, for example. Conceptually, it is possible that
techniques to draw CO, out of the atmosphere (known as carbon dioxide removal, or CDR) could contribute to
limiting warming to 1.5°C. One use of CDR could be to compensate for greenhouse gas emissions from sectors
that cannot completely decarbonize, or which may take a long time to do so.
"	Text
"Afforestation (planting new trees) and reforestation (replanting trees where they previously existed) are also
considered forms of CDR because they enhance natural CO, ‘sinks’. Another category of CDR techniques uses
chemical processes to capture CO, from the air and store it away on very long time scales. In a process known
as direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), CO, is extracted directly from the air and stored in geological
formations deep underground. Converting waste plant material into a charcoal-like substance called biochar and
burying it in soil can also be used to store carbon away from the atmosphere for decades to centuries.
"	Text
"If global temperature temporarily overshoots 1.5°C, CDR would be required to reduce the atmospheric
concentration of CO, to bring global temperature back down. To achieve this temperature reduction, the amount
of CO, drawn out of the atmosphere would need to be greater than the amount entering the atmosphere,
resulting in ‘net negative emissions’. This would involve a greater amount of CDR than stabilizing atmospheric
CO, concentration — and, therefore, global temperature — at a certain level. The larger and longer an overshoot,
the greater the reliance on practices that remove CO, from the atmosphere.
"	Text
"There can be beneficial side effects of some types of CDR, other than removing CO, from the atmosphere. For
example, restoring forests or mangroves can enhance biodiversity and protect against flooding and storms. But
there could also be risks involved with some CDR methods. For example, deploying BECCS at large scale would
require a large amount of land to cultivate the biomass required for bioenergy. This could have consequences
for sustainable development if the use of land competes with producing food to support a growing population,
biodiversity conservation or land rights. There are also other considerations. For example, there are uncertainties
about how much it would cost to deploy DACCS as a CDR technique, given that removing CO, from the air
requires considerable energy.
"	Text
"There are a number of CDR methods, each with different potentials for achieving negative emissions, as well
as different associated costs and side effects. They are also at differing levels of development, with some more
conceptual than others. One example of a CDR method in the demonstration phase is a process known as
bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), in which atmospheric CO, is absorbed by plants and trees
as they grow, and then the plant material (biomass) is burned to produce bioenergy. The CO, released in the
production of bioenergy is captured before it reaches the atmosphere and stored in geological formations deep
underground on very long time scales. Since the plants absorb CO, as they grow and the process does not emit

"Summary: Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) refers to the process of removing CO, from the atmosphere. Since this is
the opposite of emissions, practices or technologies that remove CO, are often described as achieving ‘negative
emissions’. The process is sometimes referred to more broadly as greenhouse gas removal if it involves removing
gases other than CO, There are two main types of CDR: either enhancing existing natural processes that remove
carbon from the atmosphere (e.g., by increasing its uptake by trees, soil, or other ‘carbon sinks’) or using chemical
processes to, for example, capture CO, directly from the ambient air and store it elsewhere (e.g., underground).
All CDR methods are at different stages of development and some are more conceptual than others, as they have
not been tested at scale.

"FAQ 4.3 | Why is Adaptation Important in a 1.5°C-Warmer World?
"	Title
"In general, an increase in global temperature from present day to 1.5°C or 2°C (or higher) above pre-industrial
temperatures would increase the need for adaptation. Stabilizing global temperature increase at 1.5°C would
require a smaller adaptation effort than for 2°C.
"	Text
"Adaptation refers to the process of adjustment to actual or expected changes in climate and its effects. Since
different parts of the world are experiencing the impacts of climate change differently, there is similar diversity
in how people in a given region are adapting to those impacts.
"	Text
"Since adaptation is still in early stages in many regions, there are questions about the capacity of vulnerable
communities to cope with any amount of further warming. Successful adaptation can be supported at
the national and sub-national levels, with national governments playing an important role in coordination,
planning, determining policy priorities, and distributing resources and support. However, given that the need
for adaptation can be very different from one community to the next, the kinds of measures that can successfully
reduce climate risks will also depend heavily on the local context.
"	Text
"Summary: Adaptation is the process of adjusting to current or expected changes in climate and its effects. Even
though climate change is a global problem, its impacts are experienced differently across the world. This means
that responses are often specific to the local context, and so people in different regions are adapting in different
ways. A rise in global temperature from the current 1°C above pre-industrial levels to 1.5°C, and beyond, increases
the need for adaptation. Therefore, stabilizing global temperatures at 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels would
require a smaller adaptation effort than at 2°C. Despite many successful examples around the world, progress in
adaptation is, in many regions, in its infancy and unevenly distributed globally.
"	Text
"The world is already experiencing the impacts from 1°C of global warming above pre-industrial levels, and there
are many examples of adaptation to impacts associated with this warming. Examples of adaptation efforts taking
place around the world include investing in flood defences such as building sea walls or restoring mangroves,
efforts to guide development away from high risk areas, modifying crops to avoid yield reductions, and using
social learning (social interactions that change understanding on the community level) to modify agricultural
practices, amongst many others. Adaptation also involves building capacity to respond better to climate change
impacts, including making governance more flexible and strengthening financing mechanisms, such as by
providing different types of insurance.
"	Text
"Examples from around the world show that adaptation is an iterative process. Adaptation pathways describe
how communities can make decisions about adaptation in an ongoing and flexible way. Such pathways allow
for pausing, evaluating the outcomes of specific adaptation actions, and modifying the strategy as appropriate.
Due to their flexible nature, adaptation pathways can help to identify the most effective ways to minimise the
impacts of present and future climate change for a given local context. This is important since adaptation can
sometimes exacerbate vulnerabilities and existing inequalities if poorly designed. The unintended negative
consequences of adaptation that can sometimes occur are known as ‘maladaptation’. Maladaptation can be seen
if a particular adaptation option has negative consequences for some (e.g., rainwater harvesting upstream might
reduce water availability downstream) or if an adaptation intervention in the present has trade-offs in the future
(e.g., desalination plants may improve water availability in the present but have large energy demands over time).
"	Text
"When done successfully, adaptation can allow individuals to adjust to the impacts of climate change in ways that
minimize negative consequences and to maintain their livelihoods. This could involve, for example, a farmer
switching to drought-tolerant crops to deal with increasing occurrences of heatwaves. In some cases, however,
the impacts of climate change could result in entire systems changing significantly, such as moving to an entirely
new agricultural system in areas where the climate is no longer suitable for current practices. Constructing
sea walls to stop flooding due to sea level rise from climate change is another example of adaptation, but
developing city planning to change how flood water is managed throughout the city would be an example
of transformational adaptation. These actions require significantly more institutional, structural, and financial
support. While this kind of transformational adaptation would not be needed everywhere in a 1.5°C world, the
scale of change needed would be challenging to implement, as it requires additional support, such as through
financial assistance and behavioural change. Few empirical examples exist to date.

"FAQ 4.3, Figure 1 | Why is adaptation important in a world with global warming of 1.5°C? Examples of adaptation and transformational adaptation.
Adapting to further warming requires action at national and sub-national levels and can mean different things to different people in different contexts. While
transformational adaptation would not be needed everywhere in a world limited to 1.5°C warming, the scale of change needed would be challenging to implement.
"	Text
"While adaptation is important to reduce the negative impacts from climate change, adaptation measures on
their own are not enough to prevent climate change impacts entirely. The more global temperature rises, the
more frequent, severe, and erratic the impacts will be, and adaptation may not protect against all risks. Examples
of where limits may be reached include substantial loss of coral reefs, massive range losses for terrestrial species,

more human deaths from extreme heat, and losses of coastal-dependent livelihoods in low lying islands and
coasts.

bi-directional interplay between sustainable development, including
its focus on eradicating poverty and reducing inequality in their
multidimensional aspects, and climate actions in a 1.5°C warmer world.
These fundamental connections are embedded in the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs). The chapter also examines synergies
and trade-offs of adaptation and mitigation options with sustainable
development and the SDGs and offers insights into possible pathways,
especially climate-resilient development pathways towards a 1.5°C

adaptation pathways (i) ensure a diversity of adaptation options based
on people’s values and the trade-offs they consider acceptable, (ii)
maximize synergies with sustainable development through inclusive,

"While the SDGs capture many important aspects of sustainable
development, including the explicit goals of poverty eradication
and reducing inequality, there are direct connections from
climate to other measures of sustainable development including
multidimensional poverty, equity, ethics, human security, well-
being and climate-resilient development (Bebbington and
Larrinaga, 2014; Robertson, 2014; Redclift and Springett, 2015;
Barrington-Leigh, 2016; Helliwell et al., 2018; Kirby and O'Mahony,

as ‘eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, combating
inequality within and among countries, preserving the planet,
creating sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth and
fostering social inclusion’ (UN, 2015b). There is robust evidence
of the links between climate change and poverty (see Chapter 1,
Cross-Chapter Box 4). The AR5 concluded with high confidence
that disruptive levels of climate change would preclude reducing
poverty (Denton et al., 2014; Fleurbaey et al., 2014). International
organizations have since stated that climate changes ‘undermine
the ability of all countries to achieve sustainable development’ (UN,
2015b) and can reverse or erase improvements in living conditions
and decades of development (Hallegatte et al., 2016).

consequences for subsistence and rain-fed agriculture and food security
(Savo et al. 2016). In Bangladesh, by 2050, damages and losses are
expected for poor households dependent on freshwater fish stocks due
to lack of mobility, limited access to land and strong reliance on local
ecosystems (Dasgupta et al, 2017). Small Island Developing States
(SIDS) are expected to experience challenging conditions at 1.5°C
warming due to increased risk of internal migration and displacement
and limits to adaptation (see Chapter 3, Box 3.5, Cross-Chapter Box

3 million metric tonnes per degree warming would have serious
regional impacts for the Indo-Pacific region and the Arctic (Cheung et

The ARS described adaptation limits as points beyond which actors’ objectives are compromised by intolerable risks threatening key
objectives such as good health or broad levels of well-being, thus requiring transformative adaptation for overcoming soft limits
(see Chapter 4, Sections 4.2.2.3, 4.5.3 and Cross-Chapter Box 9, Section 5.3.1) (Dow et al., 2013; Klein et al., 2014). The AR5 WGIl
risk tables, based on expert judgment, depicted the potential for, and the limits of, additional adaptation to reduce risk. Near-term
(2030-2040) risks can be used as a proxy for 1.5°C warming by the end of the century and compared to longer-term (2080-2100)
risks associated with an approximate 2°C warming. Building on the ARS risk approach, Cross-Chapter Box 12, Figure 1 provides a
stylised application example to poverty and inequality.

Residual climate-related risks, limits to adaptation, and loss and damage (see Glossary) are increasingly assessed in the scientific
literature (van der Geest and Warner, 2015; Boyd et al., 2017; Mechler et al, 2019). The AR5 (IPCC, 2013; Oppenheimer et al., 2014)
documented impacts that have been detected and attributed to climate change, projected increasing climate-related risks with con-
tinued global warming, and recognized barriers and limits to adaptation. It recognized that adaptation is constrained by biophysi-
cal, institutional, financial, social and cultural factors, and that the interaction of these factors with climate change can lead to soft
adaptation limits (adaptive actions currently not available) and hard adaptation limits (adaptive actions appear infeasible leading
to unavoidable impacts) (Klein et al., 2014).

"LOSS and damage: concepts and perspectives

‘Loss and Damage’ (L&D) has been discussed in international climate negotiations for three decades (INC, 1991; Calliari, 2016;
Vanhala and Hestbaek, 2016). A work programme on L&D was established as part of the Cancun Adaptation Framework in 2010
supporting developing countries particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts (UNFCCC, 2011a). In 2013, the Conference of
the Parties (COP) 19 established the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM) as a formal part of the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) architecture (UNFCCC, 2014). It acknowledges that L&D ‘includes,
and in some cases involves more than, that which can be reduced by adaptation’ (UNFCCC, 2014). The Paris Agreement recognized
‘the importance of averting, minimizing and addressing loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change’
through Article 8 (UNFCCC, 2015).
"	Text
"There is no one definition of L&D in climate policy, and analysis of policy documents and stakeholder views has demonstrated ambi-
guity (Vanhala and Hestbaek, 2016; Boyd et al., 2017). UNFCCC documents suggest that L&D is associated with adverse impacts
of climate change on human and natural systems, including impacts from extreme events and slow-onset processes (UNFCCC,
2011b, 2014, 2015). Some documents focus on impacts in developing or particularly vulnerable countries (UNFCCC, 201 1b, 2014).
They refer to economic (loss of assets and crops) and non-economic (biodiversity, culture, health) impacts, the latter also being an
action area under the WIM workplan, and irreversible and permanent loss and damage. Lack of clarity of what the term addresses
(avoidance through adaptation and mitigation, unavoidable losses, climate risk management, existential risk) was expressed among
stakeholders, with further disagreement ensuing about what constitutes anthropogenic climate change versus natural climate vari-
ability (Boyd et al., 2017).

The literature on risks at 1.5°C (versus 2°C and more) and potentials for adaptation remains limited, particularly for specific regions,
sectors, and vulnerable and disadvantaged populations. Adaptation potential at 1.5°C and 2°C is rarely assessed explicitly, making
an assessment of residual risk challenging. Substantial progress has been made since the AR5 to assess which climate change
impacts on natural and human systems can be attributed to anthropogenic emissions (Hansen and Stone, 2016) and to examine
the influence of anthropogenic emissions on extreme weather events (NASEM, 2016), and on consequent impacts on human life
(Mitchell et al, 2016), but less so on monetary losses and risks (Schaller et al., 2016). There has also been some limited research to
examine local-level limits to adaptation (Warner and Geest, 2013; Filho and Nalau, 2018). What constitutes losses and damages
is context-dependent and often requires place-based research into what people value and consider worth protecting (Barnett et
al., 2016; Tschakert et al., 2017). Yet assessments of non-material and intangible losses are particularly challenging, such as loss
of sense of place, belonging, identity, and damage to emotional and mental well-being (Serdeczny et al., 2017; Wewerinke-Singh,
2018a). Warming of 1.5°C is not considered ‘safe’ for most nations, communities, ecosystems and sectors, and poses significant risks
to natural and human systems as compared to the current warming of 1°C (high confidence) (see Chapter 3, Section 3.4, Box 3.4,
Box 3.5, Table 3.5, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 3). Table 5.2, drawing on findings from Chapters 3, 4 and 5, presents examples
of soft and hard limits in natural and human systems in the context of 1.5°C and 2°C of warming.

Conceptual and applied work since the AR5 has highlighted the synergies and differences with adaptation and disaster risk reduction
policies (van der Geest and Warner, 2015; Thomas and Benjamin, 2017), suggesting more integration of existing mechanisms, yet
careful consideration is advised for slow-onset and potentially irreversible impacts and risk (Mechler and Schinko, 2016). Scholarship
on justice and equity has provided insight on compensatory, distributive and procedural equity considerations for policy and practice
to address loss and damage (Roser et al., 2015; Wallimann-Helmer, 2015; Huggel et al., 2016). A growing body of legal literature
considers the role of litigation in preventing and addressing loss and damage and finds that litigation risks for governments and
business are bound to increase with improved understanding of impacts and risks as climate science evolves (high confidence)
(Mayer, 2016; Banda and Fulton, 2017; Marjanac and Patton, 2018; Wewerinke-Singh, 2018b). Policy proposals include international
support for experienced losses and damages (Crosland et al, 2016; Page and Heyward, 2017), addressing climate displacement,
donor-supported implementation of regional public insurance systems (Surminski et al., 2016) and new global governance systems

development, poverty eradication and reducing inequalities in general,
and the SDGs specifically, are expected to be largely positive, given
that the inherent purpose of adaptation is to lower risks. Building on
Chapter 4 (see Section 4.3.5), this section examines synergies and
trade-offs between adaptation and sustainable development for some
key sectors and approaches.

"Coastal adaptation: Adaptation to sea level rise remains essential
in coastal areas even under a climate stabilization scenario of 1.5°C
(Nicholls et al, 2018). Coastal adaptation to restore ecosystems (for
instance by planting mangrove forests) supports SDGs for enhancing
life and livelihoods on land and oceans (see Chapter 4, Sections
4.3.2.3). Synergistic outcomes between development and relocation
of coastal communities are enhanced by participatory decision-making
and settlement designs that promote equity and sustainability (van der
Voorn et al., 2017). Limits to coastal adaptation may rise, for instance
in low-lying islands in the Pacific, Caribbean and Indian Ocean, with
attendant implications for loss and damage (see Chapter 3 Box 3.5,
Chapter 4, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4, Cross-Chapter Box 12 in

"Agricultural adaptation: The most direct synergy is between SDG 2
(zero hunger) and adaptation in cropping, livestock and food systems,
designed to maintain or increase production (Lipper et al. 2014;
Rockstrém et al., 2017). Farmers with effective adaptation strategies
tend to enjoy higher food security and experience lower levels of
poverty (FAO, 2015; Douxchamps et al., 2016; Ali and Erenstein, 2017).
Vermeulen et al. (2016) report strong positive returns on investment
across the world from agricultural adaptation with side benefits for
environment and economic well-being. Well-adapted agricultural
systems contribute to safe drinking water, health, biodiversity and
equity goals (DeClerck et al, 2016; Myers et al., 2017). Climate-smart
agriculture has synergies with food security, though it can be biased
towards technological solutions, may not be gender sensitive, and can
create specific challenges for institutional and distributional aspects

"Adaptation to protect human health: Adaptation options in the health
sector are expected to reduce morbidity and mortality (Arbuthnott
et al., 2016; Ebi and Otmani del Barrio, 2017). Heat-early-warning
systems help lower injuries, illnesses and deaths (Hess and Ebi, 2016),
with positive impacts for SDG 3. Institutions better equipped to
share information, indicators for detecting climate-sensitive diseases,
improved provision of basic health care services and coordination
with other sectors also improve risk management, thus reducing
adverse health outcomes (Dasgupta et al, 2016; Dovie et al., 2017).
Effective adaptation creates synergies via basic public health measures
(K.R. Smith et al, 2014; Dasgupta, 2016) and health infrastructure
protected from extreme weather events (Watts et al., 2015). Yet trade-
offs can occur when adaptation in one sector leads to negative impacts
in another sector. Examples include the creation of urban wetlands
through flood control measures which can breed mosquitoes, and
migration eroding physical and mental well-being, hence adversely
affecting SDG 3 (K.R. Smith et al., 2014; Watts et al, 2015). Similarly,
increased use of air conditioning enhances resilience to heat stress
(Petkova et al., 2017), yet it can result in higher energy consumption,

"3.3. Adaptation Pathways towards a 1.5°C Warmer
World and Implications for Inequalities
"	Title
"Pursuing a place-specific adaptation pathway approach towards a
1.5°C warmer world harbours the potential for significant positive
outcomes, with synergies for well-being possibilities to ‘leap-frog the
SDGs' (J.R.A. Butler et al., 2016), in countries at all levels of development
(medium evidence, high agreement). It allows for identifying local,
socially salient tipping points before they are crossed, based on what
people value and trade-offs that are acceptable to them (Barnett et al.,
2014, 2016; Gorddard et al., 2016; Tschakert et al., 2017). Yet evidence
also reveals adverse impacts that reinforce rather than reduce existing
social inequalities and hence may lead to poverty traps (medium
evidence, high agreement) (Nagoda, 2015; Warner et al., 2015; Barnett
et al., 2016; J.R.A. Butler et al, 2016; Godfrey-Wood and Naess, 2016;

"In a 1.5°C warmer world, adaptation measures and options would
need to be intensified, accelerated and scaled up. This entails not only
the right ‘mix’ of options (asking ‘right for whom and for what?’) but
also a forward-looking understanding of dynamic trajectories, that is
adaptation pathways (see Chapter 1, Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter
1), best understood as decision-making processes over sets of potential
action sequenced over time (Campeanu and Fazey, 2014; Wise et al.,
2014). Given the scarcity of literature on adaptation pathways that
navigate place-specific warming experiences at 1.5°C, this section
presents insights into current local decision-making for adaptation
futures. This grounded evidence shows that choices between possible
pathways, at different scales and for different groups of people, are
shaped by uneven power structures and historical legacies that create
their own, often unforeseen change (Fazey et al., 2016; Bosomworth
et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2017; Murphy et al., 2017; Pelling et al., 2018).

"There are clear synergies between adaptation options and several
SDGs, such as poverty eradication, elimination of hunger, clean water
and health (robust evidence, high agreement), as well-integrated
adaptation supports sustainable development (Eakin et al., 2014;
Weisser et al., 2014; Adam, 2015; Smucker et al., 2015). Substantial
synergies are observed in the agricultural and health sectors, and
in ecosystem-based adaptations. However, particular adaptation
strategies can lead to adverse consequences for developmental
outcomes (medium evidence, high agreement). Adaptation strategies
that advance one SDG can result in trade-offs with other SDGs; for
instance, agricultural adaptation to enhance food security (SDG 2)
causing negative impacts for health, equality and healthy ecosystems
(SDGs 3, 5, 6, 10, 14 and 15), and resilience to heat stress increasing
energy consumption (SDGs 3 and 7) and high-cost adaptation
in resource-constrained contexts (medium evidence, medium

"Community-based adaptation: Community-based adaptation (CBA)
(see Chapter 4, Sections 4.3.3.2) enhances resilience and sustainability
of adaptation plans (Ford et al., 2016; Fernandes-Jesus et al., 2017;
Grantham and Rudd, 2017; Gustafson et al., 2017). Yet negative
impacts occur if it fails to fairly represent vulnerable populations
and to foster long-term social resilience (Ensor, 2016; Taylor Aiken
et al. 2017). Mainstreaming CBA into planning and decision-making
enables the attainment of SDGs 5, 10 and 16 (Archer et al., 2014;
Reid and Huq, 2014; Vardakoulias and Nicholles, 2014; Cutter, 2016;
Kim et al., 2017). Incorporating multiple forms of indigenous and
local knowledge is an important element of CBA, as shown for
instance in the Arctic region (see Chapter 4, Section 4.3.5.5, Box 4.3,
Cross-Chapter Box 9) (Apgar et al., 2015; Armitage, 2015; Pearce
et al., 2015; Chief et al., 2016; Cobbinah and Anane, 2016; Ford et
al., 2016). Indigenous and local knowledge can be synergistic with
achieving SDGs 2, 6 and 10 (Ayers et al., 2014; Lasage et al., 2015;

assessments remain difficult (see Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2.2) (Doswald
et al., 2014). Examples include mangrove restoration reducing
coastal vulnerability, protecting marine and terrestrial ecosystems,
and increasing local food security, as well as watershed management
reducing flood risks and improving water quality (Chong, 2014).
In drylands, EBA practices, combined with community-based
adaptation, have shown how to link adaptation with mitigation to
improve livelihood conditions of poor farmers (Box 5.1). Synergistic
developmental outcomes arise where EBA is cost effective, inclusive
of indigenous and local knowledge and easily accessible by the poor
(Ojea, 2015; Daigneault et al., 2016; Estrella et al, 2016). Payment for
ecosystem services can provide incentives to land owners and natural
resource managers to preserve environmental services with synergies
with SDGs 1 and 13 (Arriagada et al., 2015), when implementation
challenges are overcome (Calvet-Mir et al., 2015; Wegner, 2016; Chan
et al., 2017). Trade-offs include loss of other economic land use types,
tension between biodiversity and adaptation priorities, and conflicts
over governance (Wamsler et al., 2014; Ojea, 2015).

"Past development trajectories as well as transformational adaptation
plans can constrain adaptation futures by reinforcing dominant
political-economic structures and processes, and narrowing option
spaces; this leads to maladaptive pathways that preclude alternative,
locally relevant and sustainable development initiatives and increase
vulnerabilities (Warner and Kuzdas, 2017; Gajjar et al, 2018). Such
dominant pathways tend to validate the practices, visions and
values of existing governance regimes and powerful members of a
community while devaluing those of less privileged stakeholders.
Examples from Romania, the Solomon Islands and Australia illustrate
such pathway dynamics in which individual economic gains and
prosperity matter more than community cohesion and solidarity; this
discourages innovation, exacerbates inequalities and further erodes
adaptive capacities of the most vulnerable (Davies et al., 2014; Fazey
et al., 2016; Bosomworth et al, 2017). In the city of London, United
Kingdom, the dominant adaptation and disaster risk management
pathway promotes resilience that emphasizes self-reliance; yet it
intensifies the burden on low-income citizens, the elderly, migrants
and others unable to afford flood insurance or protect themselves
against heat waves (Pelling et al., 2016). Adaptation pathways in the
Bolivian Altiplano have transformed subsistence farmers into world-
leading quinoa producers, but loss of social cohesion and traditional
values, dispossession and loss of ecosystem services now constitute
undesirable trade-offs (Chelleri et al., 2016).

the impacts on workers through retraining programmes is essential
in order to align the phase-down of mining industries with meeting
ambitious climate targets, and the objectives of a ‘just transition’
(Galgéczi, 2014; Caldecott et al, 2017; Healy and Barry, 2017). This
aspect is even more important in developing countries where the
mining workforce is largely semi- or unskilled (Altieri et al., 2016; Tung,

decoupling potentials in industrialized fossil exporting economies
(Hatfield-Dodds et al., 2015).

"Stringent climate mitigation pathways in line with ‘well below 2°C’ or
‘1.5°C’ goals often rely on the deployment of large-scale land-related
measures, like afforestation and/or bioenergy supply (Popp et al., 2014;
Rose et al., 2014; Creutzig et al, 2015). These land-related measures
can compete with food production and hence raise food security
concerns (Section 5.4.1.3) (P. Smith et al, 2014). Mitigation studies
indicate that so-called ‘single-minded’ climate policy, aiming solely
at limiting warming to 1.5°C or 2°C without concurrent measures in
the food sector, can have negative impacts for global food security
(Hasegawa et al., 2015; McCollum et al., 2018b). Impacts of 1.5°C
mitigation pathways can be significantly higher than those of 2°C
pathways (Figures 5.4 and 5.5). An important driver of the food security
impacts in these scenarios is the increase of food prices and the effect
of mitigation on disposable income and wealth due to GHG pricing. A
recent study indicates that, on aggregate, the price and income effects
on food may be bigger than the effect due to competition over land
between food and bioenergy (Hasegawa et al., 2015).

combining quantitative modelling and qualitative narratives at multiple

"In summary, the assessment of mitigation pathways shows that to
meet the 1.5°C target, a wide range of mitigation options would need
to be deployed (see Chapter 2, Sections 2.3 and 2.4). While pathways
aiming at 1.5°C are associated with high synergies for some sustainable
development dimensions (such as human health and air pollution, forest
preservation), the rapid pace and magnitude of the required changes
would also lead to increased risks for trade-offs for other sustainable
development dimensions (particularly food security) (Figures 5.4 and
5.5). Synergies and trade-offs are expected to be unevenly distributed
between regions and nations (Box 5.2), though little literature has
formally examined such distributions under 1.5°C-consistent mitigation
scenarios. Reducing these risks requires smart policy designs and
mechanisms that shield the poor and redistribute the burden so that the
most vulnerable are not disproportionately affected. Recent scenario
analyses show that associated investments for reducing the trade-offs
for, for example, food, water and energy access to be significantly lower
than the required mitigation investments (McCollum et al., 2018b).

behavioural changes, can help to significantly reduce the reliance on

"Insights into climate-compatible development (see Glossary)
illustrate how integration between adaptation, mitigation and
sustainable development works in context-specific projects, how
synergies are achieved and what challenges are encountered during

The operationalization of climate-compatible development, including
climate-smart agriculture and carbon-forestry projects (Lipper et al.,
2014; Campbell et al., 2016; Quan et al., 2017), shows multilevel
and multisector trade-offs involving ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ across
governance levels (high confidence) (Kongsager and Corbera, 2015;
Naess et al., 2015; Karlsson et al., 2017; Tanner et al., 2017; Taylor,
2017; Wood, 2017; Ficklin et al, 2018). Issues of power, participation,
values, equity, inequality and justice transcend case study examples of
attempted integrated approaches (Nunan, 2017; Phillips et al, 2017;
Stringer et al., 2017; Wood, 2017), also reflected in policy frameworks

"Quantitative pathways studies now better represent ‘nexus’
approaches to assess sustainable development dimensions. In such
approaches (see Chapter 4, Section 4.3.3.8), a subset of sustainable
development dimensions are investigated together because of their
close relationships (Welsch et al., 2014; Conway et al. 2015; Keairns
et al., 2016; Parkinson et al., 2016; Rasul and Sharma, 2016; Howarth
and Monasterolo, 2017). Compared to single-objective climate-SDG
assessments (Section 5.4.2), nexus solutions attempt to integrate
complex interdependencies across diverse sectors in a systems
approach for consistent analysis. Recent pathways studies show how
water, energy and climate (SDGs 6, 7 and 13) interact (Parkinson et al.,
2016; McCollum et al., 2018b) and call for integrated water—energy
investment decisions to manage systemic risks. For instance, the
provision of bioenergy, important in many 1.5°C-consistent pathways,
can help resolve ‘nexus challenges’ by alleviating energy security
concerns, but can also have adverse ‘nexus impacts’ on food security,
water use and biodiversity (Lotze-Campen et al., 2014; Bonsch et al.,
2016). Policies that improve resource use efficiency across sectors can
maximize synergies for sustainable development (Bartos and Chester,
2014; McCollum et al., 2018b; van Vuuren et al., 2018). Mitigation
compatible with 1.5°C can significantly reduce impacts and adaptation
needs in the nexus sectors compared to 2°C (Byers et al., 2018). In
order to avoid trade-offs due to high carbon pricing of 1.5°C pathways,
regulation in specific areas may complement price-based instruments.
Such combined policies generally lead also to more early action
maximizing synergies and avoiding some of the adverse climate effects
for sustainable development (Bertram et al., 2018).

resilient development pathways (CRDPs) introduced in the ARS

(eg., Eriksen et al., 2017; Johnson, 2017; Orindi et al, 2017; Kirby and
O'Mahony, 2018; Solecki et al., 2018) that uses CRDPs as a conceptual
and aspirational idea for steering societies towards low-carbon,
prosperous and ecologically safe futures. Such a notion of pathways
foregrounds decision-making processes at local to national levels to
situate transformation, resilience, equity and well-being in the complex
reality of specific places, nations and communities (Harris et al., 2017;
Ziervogel et al., 2017; Fazey et al., 2018; Gajjar et al., 2018; Klinsky and

"(Rogelj et al, 2018). SSP1 — which depicts broader ‘sustainability’ as
well as enhancing equity and poverty reductions — is the only pathway
where all models could reach 1.5°C and is associated with the lowest
mitigation costs across all SSPs. A decreasing number of models was
successful for SSP2, SSP4 and SSP5, respectively, indicating distinctly
higher risks of failure due to high growth and energy intensity as
well as geographical and social inequalities and uneven regional
development. And reaching 1.5°C has even been found infeasible in
the less sustainable SSP3 — ‘regional rivalry’ (Fujimori et al, 2017b;
Riahi et al., 2017). All these conclusions hold true if a 2°C objective is
considered (Calvin et al., 2017; Fujimori et al, 2017b; Popp et al., 2017;
Riahi et al., 2017). Rogelj et al. (2018) also show that fewer scenarios
are, however, feasible across different SSPs in case of 1.5°C, and
mitigation costs substantially increase in 1.5°C pathways compared
to 2°C pathways.

"Pathways compatible with 1.5°C warming are not merely scenarios
to envision possible futures but processes of deliberation and
implementation that address societal values, local priorities and
inevitable trade-offs. This includes attention to politics and power that
perpetuate business-as-usual trajectories (O’Brien, 2016; Harris et al.,
2017), the politics that shape sustainability and capabilities of everyday
life (Agyeman et al., 2016; Schlosberg et al., 2017), and ingredients
for community resilience and transformative change (Fazey et al.,
2018). Chartering CRDPs encourages locally situated and problem-
solving processes to negotiate and operationalize resilience ‘on the
ground’ (Beilin and Wilkinson, 2015; Harris et al, 2017; Ziervogel et
al., 2017). This entails contestation, inclusive governance and iterative
engagement of diverse populations with varied needs, aspirations,
agency and rights claims, including those most affected, to deliberate
trade-offs in a multiplicity of possible pathways (high confidence) (see

"There is a wide range of SSP-based studies focusing on the connections
between adaptation/impacts and different sustainable development
dimensions (Hasegawa et al., 2014; Ishida et al., 2014; Arnell et al,
2015; Bowyer et al, 2015; Burke et al., 2015; Lemoine and Kapnick,

and Rozenberg, 2017; O'Neill et al, 2017a; Rutledge et al, 2017;
Byers et al., 2018). New methods for projecting inequality and poverty
(downscaled to sub-national rural and urban levels as well as spatially
explicit levels) have enabled advanced SSP-based assessments of
locally sustainable development implications of avoided impacts
and related adaptation needs. For instance, Byers et al. (2018) find
that, in a 1.5°C warmer world, a focus on sustainable development
can reduce the climate risk exposure of populations vulnerable to
poverty by more than an order of magnitude (Section 5.2.2). Moreover,
aggressive reductions in between-country inequality may decrease
the emissions intensity of global economic growth (Rao and Min,
2018). This is due to the higher potential for decoupling of energy
from income growth in lower-income countries, due to high potential
for technological advancements that reduce the energy intensity of
growth of poor countries — critical also for reaching 1.5°C in a socially
and economically equitable way. Participatory downscaling of SSPs in
several European Union countries and in Central Asia shows numerous
possible pathways of solutions to the 2°C-1.5°C goal, depending on
differential visions (Tabara et al. 2018). Other participatory applications
of the SSPs, for example in West Africa (Palazzo et al, 2017) and the
southeastern United States (Absar and Preston, 2015), illustrate the
potentially large differences in adaptive capacity within regions and
between sectors.

The concentration of economic activity, dense social networks, human resource capacity, investment in infrastructure and buildings,
relatively nimble local governments, close connection to surrounding rural and natural environments, and a tradition of innovation
provide urban areas with transformational potential (see Chapter 4, Section 4.3.3) (Castan Broto, 2017). In this sense, the urbanization

megatrend that will take place over the next three decades, and add approximately 2 billion people to the global urban population

that deviate fundamentally from high-carbon, business-as-usual
futures (Okereke and Coventry, 2016; Arts, 2017; Gupta and Arts,

acceptable, inclusive and equitable pathways towards climate-
resilient futures is a challenging, yet important, endeavour, fraught
with complex moral, practical and political difficulties and inevitable
trade-offs (very high confidence). The ultimate questions are: what

"Cities can also, however, concentrate the risks of flooding, landslides, fire and infectious and parasitic disease that are expected to
heighten in a 1.5°C warmer world (Chapter 3). In African and Asian countries where urbanization rates are highest, these risks could
expose and amplify pre-existing stresses related to poverty, exclusion, and governance (Gore, 2015; Dodman et al., 2017; Jiang and
O'Neill, 2017; Pelling et al., 2018; Solecki et al., 2018). Through its impact on economic development and investment, urbanization
often leads to increased consumption and environmental degradation and enhanced vulnerability and risk (Rosenzweig et al., 2018).
In the absence of innovation, the combination of urbanization and urban economic development could contribute 226 GtCO2 in
emissions by 2050 (Bai et al., 2018). At the same time, some new urban developments are demonstrating combined carbon and
Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) benefits (Wiktorowicz et al., 2018), and it is in towns and cities that building renovation rates
can be most easily accelerated to support the transition to 1.5°C pathways (Kuramochi et al., 2018), including through voluntary

"Transition Towns (TTs) are a type of urban transformation that have emerged mainly in high-income countries. The grassroots TT
movement (origin in the United Kingdom) combines adaptation, mitigation and just transitions, mainly at the level of communities
and small towns. It now has more than 1,300 registered local initiatives in more than 40 countries (Grossmann and Creamer,
2017), many of them in the United Kingdom, the United States, and other high-income countries. TTs are described as ‘progressive
localism’ (Cretney et al., 2016), aiming to foster a ‘communitarian ecological citizenship’ that goes beyond changes in consumption
and lifestyle (Kenis, 2016). They aspire to promote equitable communities resilient to the impacts of climate change, peak oil and
unstable global markets; re-localization of production and consumption; and transition pathways to a post-carbon future (Feola and

"Urban governance is critical to ensuring that the necessary urban transitions deliver economic growth and equity (Hughes et al.,
2018). The proximity of local governments to citizens and their needs can make them powerful agents of climate action (Melica et
al., 2018), but urban governance is enhanced when it involves multiple actors (Ziervogel et al, 2016; Pelling et al., 2018), supportive
national governments (Tait and Euston-Brown, 2017), and sub-national climate networks (see Chapter 4, Section 4.4.1). Governance
is complicated for the urban population currently living in informality. This population is expected to triple, to three billion, by
2050 (Satterthwaite et al., 2018), placing a significant portion of the world’s population beyond the direct reach of formal climate
mitigation and adaptation policies (Revi et al., 2014). How to address the co-evolved and structural conditions that lead to urban
informality and associated vulnerability to 1.5°C of warming is a central question for this report. Brown and McGranahan (2016)
cite evidence that the informal urban ‘green economy’ that has emerged out of necessity in the absence of formal service provisions
is frequently low-carbon and resource-efficient.

"Realising the potential for low carbon transitions in informal urban settlements would require an express recognition of the unpaid-
for contributions of women in the informal economy, and new partnerships between the state and communities (Ziervogel et al.,

type of service delivery and climate governance system that could steer the change on a scale required to limit to warming to 1.5°C
(Jaglin, 2014). However, work by transnational networks, such as Shack/Slum Dwellers International, C40, the Global Covenant
of Mayors, and the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives, as well as efforts to combine in-country planning for
Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) (Andonova et al., 2017; Fuhr et al, 2018) with those taking place to support the New

climate change can undermine sustainable development, and that well-designed mitigation and adaptation

If not managed carefully, such changes could undermine dimensions of sustainable development by threatening
food and water security, creating conflict over land rights and causing biodiversity loss. Another trade-off could
occur for some countries, assets, workers and infrastructure already in place if a switch is made from fossil fuels to
other energy sources without adequate planning for such a transition. Trade-offs can be minimized if effectively
managed, as when care is taken to improve bioenergy crop yields to reduce harmful land-use change or where
workers are retrained for employment in lower carbon sectors.

"Summary: Sustainable development seeks to meet the needs of people living today without compromising the
needs of future generations, while balancing social, economic and environmental considerations. The 17 UN
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) include targets for eradicating poverty; ensuring health, energy and food
security; reducing inequality; protecting ecosystems; pursuing sustainable cities and economies; and a goal for
climate action (SDG 13). Climate change affects the ability to achieve sustainable development goals, and limiting
warming to 1.5°C will help meet some sustainable development targets. Pursuing sustainable development will
influence emissions, impacts and vulnerabilities. Responses to climate change in the form of adaptation and
mitigation will also interact with sustainable development with positive effects, known as synergies, or negative
effects, known as trade-offs. Responses to climate change can be planned to maximize synergies and limit trade-
offs with sustainable development.
"	Text
"For more than 25 years, the United Nations (UN) and other international organizations have embraced the
concept of sustainable development to promote well-being and meet the needs of today’s population without
compromising the needs of future generations. This concept spans economic, social and environmental objectives
including poverty and hunger alleviation, equitable economic growth, access to resources, and the protection of
water, air and ecosystems. Between 1990 and 2015, the UN monitored a set of eight Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs). They reported progress in reducing poverty, easing hunger and child mortality, and improving
access to clean water and sanitation. But with millions remaining in poor health, living in poverty and facing
serious problems associated with climate change, pollution and land-use change, the UN decided that more
needed to be done. In 2015, the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were endorsed as part of the 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development. The 17 SDGs (Figure FAQ 5.1) apply to all countries and have a timeline
for success by 2030. The SDGs seek to eliminate extreme poverty and hunger; ensure health, education, peace,
safe water and clean energy for all; promote inclusive and sustainable consumption, cities, infrastructure and
economic growth; reduce inequality including gender inequality; combat climate change and protect oceans and
terrestrial ecosystems.

The link between sustainable development and limiting global warming to 1.5°C is recognised by the Sustainable Development Goal
for climate action (SDG 13)
"	Text
"FAQ 5.1, Figure 1 | Climate change action is one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and is connected to sustainable development
more broadly. Actions to reduce climate risk can interact with other sustainable development objectives in positive ways (synergies) and negative ways (trade-offs).
"	Text
"The link between sustainable development and limiting global warming to 1.5°C is recognized by the SDG for
climate action (SDG 13), which seeks to combat climate change and its impacts while acknowledging that the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is the primary international, intergovernmental
forum for negotiating the global response to climate change.
"	Text
"The challenge is to put in place sustainable development policies and actions that reduce deprivation, alleviate
poverty and ease ecosystem degradation while also lowering emissions, reducing climate change impacts and
facilitating adaptation. It is important to strengthen synergies and minimize trade-offs when planning climate
change adaptation and mitigation actions. Unfortunately, not all trade-offs can be avoided or minimized, but
careful planning and implementation can build the enabling conditions for long-term sustainable development.
"	Text
"Limiting temperature increase to 1.5°C can make it much easier to achieve the SDGs, but it is also possible that
pursuing the SDGs could result in trade-offs with efforts to limit climate change. There are trade-offs when
people escaping from poverty and hunger consume more energy or land and thus increase emissions, or if
goals for economic growth and industrialization increase fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.
Conversely, efforts to reduce poverty and gender inequalities and to enhance food, health and water security can
reduce vulnerability to climate change. Other synergies can occur when coastal and ocean ecosystem protection
reduces the impacts of climate change on these systems. The sustainable development goal of affordable and
clean energy (SDG 7) specifically targets access to renewable energy and energy efficiency, which are important
to ambitious mitigation and limiting warming to 1.5°C.

"Frequently Asked Questions
FAQ 5.2| What are the Pathways to Achieving Poverty Reduction and Reducing Inequalitie
while Reaching a 1.5°C World?
"	Title
"The Paris Agreement states that it ‘will be implemented to reflect equity... in the light of different national
circumstances’ and calls for ‘rapid reductions’ of greenhouse gases to be achieved ‘on the basis of equity, and in
the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty’. Similarly, the UN SDGs include targets

to reduce poverty and inequalities, and to ensure equitable and affordable access to health, water and energy
for all.
"	Text
"Issues of equity and fairness have long been central to climate change and sustainable development. Equity,
like equality, aims to promote justness and fairness for all. This is not necessarily the same as treating everyone
equally, since not everyone comes from the same starting point. Often used interchangeably with fairness and
justice, equity implies implementing different actions in different places, all with a view to creating an equal
world that is fair for all and where no one is left behind.
"	Text
"Well-planned adaptation and mitigation measures are essential to avoid exacerbating inequalities or creating
new injustices. Pathways that are compatible with limiting warming to 1.5°C and aligned with the SDGs consider
mitigation and adaptation options that reduce inequalities in terms of who benefits, who pays the costs and who
is affected by possible negative consequences. Attention to equity ensures that disadvantaged people can secure
their livelihoods and live in dignity, and that those who experience mitigation or adaptation costs have financial
and technical support to enable fair transitions.
"	Text
"CRDPs describe trajectories that pursue the dual goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C while strengthening sustainable
development. This includes eradicating poverty as well as reducing vulnerabilities and inequalities for regions,
countries, communities, businesses and cities. These trajectories entail a mix of adaptation and mitigation
measures consistent with profound societal and systems transformations. The goals are to meet the short-term
SDGs, achieve longer-term sustainable development, reduce emissions towards net zero around the middle of
the century, build resilience and enhance human capacities to adapt, all while paying close attention to equity
and well-being for all.
"	Text
"The characteristics of CRDPs will differ across communities and nations, and will be based on deliberations with
a diverse range of people, including those most affected by climate change and by possible routes towards
transformation. For this reason, there are no standard methods for designing CRDPs or for monitoring their
progress towards climate-resilient futures. However, examples from around the world demonstrate that flexible
and inclusive governance structures and broad participation often help support iterative decision-making,
continuous learning and experimentation. Such inclusive processes can also help to overcome weak institutional
arrangements and power structures that may further exacerbate inequalities.
"	Text
"Summary: There are ways to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Of the pathways that
exist, some simultaneously achieve sustainable development. They entail a mix of measures that lower emissions
and reduce the impacts of climate change, while contributing to poverty eradication and reducing inequalities.
Which pathways are possible and desirable will differ between and within regions and nations. This is due to
the fact that development progress to date has been uneven and climate-related risks are unevenly distributed.
Flexible governance would be needed to ensure that such pathways are inclusive, fair and equitable to avoid
poor and disadvantaged populations becoming worse off. Climate-resilient development pathways (CRDPs) offer
possibilities to achieve both equitable and low-carbon futures.
"	Text
"Equity and fairness are important for considering pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C in a way that is liveable
for every person and species. They recognize the uneven development status between richer and poorer nations,
the uneven distribution of climate impacts (including on future generations) and the uneven capacity of different
nations and people to respond to climate risks. This is particularly true for those who are highly vulnerable to
climate change, such as indigenous communities in the Arctic, people whose livelihoods depend on agriculture
or coastal and marine ecosystems, and inhabitants of small island developing states. The poorest people will
continue to experience climate change through the loss of income and livelihood opportunities, hunger, adverse
health effects and displacement.

strengthening sustainable development. Decision-making that achieves the SDGs, lowers greenhouse gas emissions and limits global warming could help lead to
a climate-resilient world, within the context of enhancing adaptation.
"	Text
"Ambitious actions already underway around the world can offer insight into CRDPs for limiting warming to 1.5°C.
For example, some countries have adopted clean energy and sustainable transport while creating environmentally
friendly jobs and supporting social welfare programmes to reduce domestic poverty. Other examples teach us
about different ways to promote development through practices inspired by community values. For instance,
Buen Vivir, a Latin American concept based on indigenous ideas of communities living in harmony with nature,
is aligned with peace; diversity; solidarity; rights to education, health, and safe food, water, and energy; and
well-being and justice for all. The Transition Movement, with origins in Europe, promotes equitable and resilient
communities through low-carbon living, food self-sufficiency and citizen science. Such examples indicate that
pathways that reduce poverty and inequalities while limiting warming to 1.5°C are possible and that they can
provide guidance on pathways towards socially desirable, equitable and low-carbon futures.

"1.5°C warmer worlds Projected worlds in which global warming
has reached and, unless otherwise indicated, been limited to 1.5°C
above pre-industrial levels. There is no single 1.5°C warmer world,
and projections of 1.5°C warmer worlds look different depending on
whether it is considered on a near-term transient trajectory or at climate
equilibrium after several millennia, and, in both cases, if it occurs with or
without overshoot. Within the 21st century, several aspects play a role
for the assessment of risk and potential impacts in 1.5°C warmer worlds:
the possible occurrence, magnitude and duration of an overshoot; the
way in which emissions reductions are achieved; the ways in which
policies might be able to influence the resilience of human and natural
systems; and the nature of the regional and sub-regional risks. Beyond
the 21st century, several elements of the climate system would continue
to change even if the global mean temperatures remain stable, including
further increases of sea level.

"Aerosol A suspension of airborne solid or liquid particles, with a
typical size between a few nanometres and 10 um that reside in the
atmosphere for at least several hours. The term aerosol, which includes
both the particles and the suspending gas, is often used in this report
in its plural form to mean aerosol particles. Aerosols may be of either
natural or anthropogenic origin. Aerosols may influence climate in
several ways: through both interactions that scatter and/or absorb
radiation and through interactions with cloud microphysics and other
cloud properties, or upon deposition on snow- or ice-covered surfaces
thereby altering their albedo and contributing to climate feedback.
Atmospheric aerosols, whether natural or anthropogenic, originate from
two different pathways: emissions of primary particulate matter (PM),
and formation of secondary PM from gaseous precursors. The bulk of
aerosols are of natural origin. Some scientists use group labels that refer
to the chemical composition, namely: sea salt, organic carbon, black
carbon (BC), mineral species (mainly desert dust), sulphate, nitrate, and
ammonium. These labels are, however, imperfect as aerosols combine
particles to create complex mixtures. See also Short-lived climate forcers

ratio) and oxygen (20.9% volume mixing ratio), together with a number
of trace gases, such as argon (0.93 % volume mixing ratio), helium and
radiatively active greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide (CO,)
(0.04% volume mixing ratio) and ozone (0,). In addition, the atmosphere
contains the GHG water vapour (H,0), whose amounts are highly

"the term BAU has fallen out of favour because the idea of business as
usual in century-long socio-economic projections is hard to fathom. In
the context of transformation pathways, the term baseline scenarios
refers to scenarios that are based on the assumption that no mitigation
policies or measures will be implemented beyond those that are already
in force and/or are legislated or planned to be adopted. Baseline
scenarios are not intended to be predictions of the future, but rather
counterfactual constructions that can serve to highlight the level of
emissions that would occur without further policy effort. Typically,
baseline scenarios are then compared to mitigation scenarios that are
constructed to meet different goals for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,
atmospheric concentrations or temperature change. The term baseline
scenario is often used interchangeably with reference scenario and no
policy scenario. See also Fission scenario and Mitigation scenario.

"Anthropocene The ‘Anthropocene’ is a proposed new geological
epoch resulting from significant human-driven changes to the structure
and functioning of the Earth System, including the climate system.
Originally proposed in the Earth System science community in 2000, the
proposed new epoch is undergoing a formalization process within the
geological community based on the stratigraphic evidence that human
activities have changed the Earth System to the extent of forming
geological deposits with a signature that is distinct from those of the
Holocene, and which will remain in the geological record. Both the
stratigraphic and Earth System approaches to defining the Anthropocene
consider the mid-20th Century to be the most appropriate starting date,
although others have been proposed and continue to be discussed. The
Anthropocene concept has been taken up by a diversity of disciplines
and the public to denote the substantive influence humans have had on
the state, dynamics and future of the Earth System. See also Holocene.

"Climate change commitment Climate change commitment is
defined as the unavoidable future climate change resulting from inertia
in the geophysical and socio-economic systems. Different types of climate
change commitment are discussed in the literature (see subterms).

"Climate Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the average
weather, or more rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of
the mean and variability of relevant quantities over a period of time
ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical
period for averaging these variables is 30 years, as defined by the World
Meteorological Organization. The relevant quantities are most often
surface variables such as temperature, precipitation and wind. Climate
in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the

(1) an assessment of carbon cycle sources and sinks on a global level,
through the synthesis of evidence for fossi/ fue! and cement emissions,
land-use change emissions, ocean and land CO, sinks, and the resulting
atmospheric CO, growth rate. This is referred to as the global carbon

emissions that that is estimated to limit global surface temperature
to a given level above a reference period, taking into account global

"Climate change Climate change refers to a change in the state of the
climate that can be identified (e.g., by using statistical tests) by changes
in the mean and/or the variability of its properties and that persists for an
extended period, typically decades or longer. Climate change may be due
to natural internal processes or external forcings such as modulations
of the solar cycles, volcanic eruptions and persistent anthropogenic
changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in /and use. Note that
the Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in its Article
1, defines climate change as: ‘a change of climate which is attributed
directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the
global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability
observed over comparable time periods.’ The UNFCCC thus makes a
distinction between climate change attributable to human activities
altering the atmospheric composition and climate variability attributable
to natural causes. See also Climate variability, Global warming, Ocean
acidification (OA) and Detection and attribution.

"Extreme weather event An extreme weather event is an event that
is rare at a particular place and time of year. Definitions of rare vary, but
an extreme weather event would normally be as rare as or rarer than the
10th or 90th percentile of a probability density function estimated from
observations. By definition, the characteristics of what is called extreme
weather may vary from place to place in an absolute sense. When a
pattern of extreme weather persists for some time, such as a season,
it may be classed as an extreme climate event, especially if it yields an
average or total that is itself extreme (e.g., drought or heavy rainfall over
a season). See also Heatwave and Climate extreme (extreme weather or
climate event).

"Short-lived climate forcers (SLCF) Short-lived climate forcers
refers to a set of compounds that are primarily composed of those with
short lifetimes in the atmosphere compared to well-mixed greenhouse
gases, and are also referred to as near-term climate forcers. This set
of compounds includes methane (CH,), which is also a well-mixed
greenhouse gas, as well as ozone (0.) and aerosols, or their precursors,
and some halogenated species that are not well-mixed greenhouse gases.
These compounds do not accumulate in the atmosphere at decadal to
centennial time scales, and so their effect on climate is predominantly
in the first decade after their emission, although their changes can still
induce long-term climate effects such as sea /evel change. Their effect
can be cooling or warming. A subset of exclusively warming short-lived
climate forcers is referred to as short-lived climate pollutants. See also
Long-lived climate forcers (LLCF).
