Pilot project in Uganda. He was a Senior Energy Economist at the UNEP Collaborating Centre for
Energy and Environment at RIS@ National Laboratory in Denmark. Before joining RIS@, he was a
lecturer at the University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, Ghana. John was one of the few well-
known energy economists on the African continent who published extensively in international journals,
conference proceedings and books in the international fora on energy economics and climate change.
He initiated several regional projects in energy and climate change in Africa because of his belief that
the climate change debate provides an opportunity for transforming African economies to more sus-

enhancing technology transfer. Interactions and barriers vary
according to sector, type of technology and country, and recent
trends in international financial flows that drive technology
transfer are altering the relative capacities and roles of different

"This Special Report has been prepared by IPCC Working Group
Ill in response to a request by the Subsidiary Body for Scientific
and Technological Advice (SBSTA) to the UNFCC. Innovation
and enhanced efforts to transfer environmentally sound tech-
nology to limit greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to
climate change will be required to meet the objective of the
Climate Convention and to reduce vulnerability to climate
change impacts. The report addresses the technology transfer
problem in the context of climate change while emphasizing the
sustainable development perspective. Technology transfer is
defined as the broad set of processes covering the flows of
know-how, experience and equipment and is the result of many
day-to-day decisions of the different stakeholders involved. A
number of social, economic, political, legal, and technological
factors influence the flow and quality of technology transfer.
Essential elements of successful transfers include consumer and
business awareness, access to information, availability of a wide
range of technical, business, management and regulatory skills
locally, and sound economic policy and regulatory frameworks.

and developing countries. Although economies in transition are
included as developed countries under the UNFCCC, they may

"This technological innovation must occur fast enough and con-
tinue over a period of time to allow greenhouse gas concentrations
to stabilize and reduce vulnerability to climate change.
Technology for mitigating and adapting to climate change should
be environmentally sound technology (EST) and should sup-

"	Text
"The Report analyses the special challenges of transferring ESTs
to address climate change in the context of sustainable develop-
ment. The literature provides ample evidence of the many prob-
lems in current processes of technology transfer which makes it
very unlikely to meet this challenge without additional actions for
the transfer of mitigation and adaptation technologies.
"	Text
" 

Achieving the ultimate objective of the UN. FCCC, as formulated
in Article 2', will require technological innovation and the rapid
and widespread transfer and implementation of technologies,
including know-how for mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions. Transfer of technology for adaptation to climate
change is also an important element of reducing vulnerability to
climate change.
"	Text
"'“The ultimate objective of this Convention and any related legal
instruments that the Conference of Parties may adopt is to achieve, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Convention, stabilisation
of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at such a level that
would prevent dangerous interference with the climate system. Such a
level should be achieved within a timeframe sufficient to allow ecosys-
tems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production
is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a
sustainable manner.”

technological and related changes in both developed and devel-

countries. Development with modern knowledge offers many
opportunities to avoid past unsustainable practices and move
more rapidly towards better technologies, techniques and asso-

"developing countries require assistance with developing human
capacity (knowledge, techniques and management skills), devel-
oping appropriate institutions and networks, and with acquiring
and adapting specific hardware. Technology transfer, in particu-
lar from developed countries to developing countries, must there-
fore operate on a broad front covering these software and hard-
ware challenges, and ideally within a framework of helping to find
new sustainable paths for economies as a whole. There is, how-
ever, no simple definition of a “sustainable development agenda”
for developing countries. Sustainable development is a context
driven concept and each society may define it differently, based
on Agenda 21. Technologies that may be suitable in each of such
contexts may differ considerably. This makes it important to
ensure that transferred technologies meet local needs and prior-
ities, thus increasing the likelihood that they will be successful,
and that there is an appropriate enabling environment for pro-
moting environmentally sound technologies (ESTs).

"Article 4.5 of the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC) states that developed country Parties
and other developed Parties included in Annex II “shall take all
practicable steps to promote, facilitate and finance, as appropri-
ate, the transfer of, or access to, environmentally sound tech-
nologies and know-how to other Parties, particularly developing
country Parties, to enable them to implement the provisions of the
Convention.” The Subsidiary Body for Scientific and
Technological Advice (SBSTA) identified at its first session a list
of areas in which it could draw upon the assistance of the IPCC.
This Special Report was prepared in response to this request. It
addresses the technology transfer problem in the context of all rel-
evant UNFCCC provisions, including decisions of the Conference
of Parties (COP), and Chapter 34 in Agenda 21. It attempts to
respond to recent development in the UNFCCC debate on tech-
nology transfer, by providing available scientific and technical
information to enable Parties to address issues and questions
identified in Decision 4/CP.4 adopted by COP-4.
"	Text
"The Report defines the term “technology transfer” as a broad set
of processes covering the flows of know-how, experience and
equipment for mitigating and adapting to climate change amongst
different stakeholders such as governments, private sector enti-
ties, financial institutions, non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) and research/education institutions. Therefore, the treat-
ment of technology transfer in this Report is much broader than
that in the UNFCCC or of any particular Article of that
Convention. The broad and inclusive term “transfer” encom-
passes diffusion of technologies and technology cooperation
across and within countries. It covers technology transfer pro-
cesses between developed countries, developing countries and
countries with economies in transition, amongst developed coun-
tries, amongst developing countries and amongst countries with
economies in transition. It comprises the process of learning to
understand, utilize and replicate* the technology, including the
capacity to choose it and adapt it to local conditions and integrate
it with indigenous technologies.

"These trends are altering the relative capacities and roles of
different stakeholders. The importance of the private sector has
increased substantially. However, there is a definite role for
governments both in providing an enabling environment for the
technology transfer process as well as participating directly in it.
Many NGOs support technology transfer activities.
"	Text
"While technology transfer processes can be complex and inter-
twined, certain stages can be identified. These may include the
identification of needs, choice of technology, assessment of con-
ditions of transfer, agreement and implementation. Evaluation and
adjustment to local conditions, and replication’ are other impor-
tant stages.
"	Text
"It is difficult to quantify how much climate-relevant hardware is
successfully transferred annually. When software elements such
as education, training and other capacity building activities are
included, the task of quantification is further complicated.
Financial flows, often used as proxies, allow only a limited com-
parison of technology transfer trends over time. The 1990s have
seen broad changes in the types and magnitudes of the inter-
national financial flows that drive technology transfer.
"	Text
"Capacity building is required at all stages in the process of tech-
nology transfer. Social structures and personal values evolve
with a society’s physical infrastructure, institutions, and the tech-
nologies embodied within them. New technological trajectories
for an economy therefore imply new social challenges. This
requires a capacity of people and organizations to continuously
adapt to new circumstances and to acquire new skills. This
applies both for mitigation and adaptation technologies.
"	Text
"Levels of foreign direct investment (FDI), commercial lending,
and equity investment all increased greatly in recent years. These
are the dominant means by which the private sector makes tech-
nology-based investments in developing countries and economies
in transition, often in the industry, energy supply and trans-
portation sectors. However, private sector investment in the form
of FDI in developing countries has favoured East and South East
Asia, and Latin America.
"	Text
"Barriers to the transfer of ESTs may arise at each stage of the
process. These vary according to the specific context, for example
from sector to sector, and can manifest themselves differently in
developed countries, developing countries and countries with
economies in transition. These barriers range from lack of infor-
mation; insufficient human capabilities; political and economic bar-
riers such as lack of capital, high transaction costs, lack of full cost
pricing, and trade and policy barriers; lack of understanding of local
needs; business limitations, such as risk aversion in financial
institutions; and institutional limitations such as insufficient legal
protection, and inadequate environmental codes and standards.*

"Official Development Assistance (ODA) experienced a downward
trend in the period from 1993 to 1997, both in absolute terms and
as a percentage of funding for projects with significant impact on
technology flows to developing countries. However, in 1998
there was an increase in ODA funding. ODA is still important for
those parts of the world and sectors where private sector flows are
comparatively low, like agriculture, forestry, human health and
coastal zone management. Moreover, it can support the creation
of enabling conditions, which may leverage larger flows of pri-
vate finance into ESTs in the context of overall sustainable devel-
opment goals in the recipient countries.

"Technology transfer results from actions taken by various stake-
holders. Key stakeholders include developers; owners; suppliers,
buyers, recipients and users of technology (such as private firms,
state enterprises, and individual consumers); financiers and
donors; governments; international institutions; NGOs and com-
munity groups. Some technology is transferred directly between
government agencies or wholly within vertically integrated firms,
but increasingly technology flows depend also on the coordina-
tion of multiple organizations such as networks of information
service providers, business consultants and financial firms.
Although stakeholders play different roles, there is a need for part-

Information access and assessment are essential to technology
transfer. However, focusing too narrowly on information barriers
while ignoring the later stages of the transfer process can be less
productive. The roles of governments and private actors in tech-
nology assessment are changing. Private information networks
are proliferating through specialized consulting and evaluation
services and over the Internet. Increasing FDI also demonstrates
that many ESTs can diffuse rapidly without direct government

It is important to recognize the need for participatory approaches
and to strengthen the networks in which diverse organizations
contribute to technology transfer. In technology intensive
economies, technology increasingly flows through private net-
works of information and assessment services, management con-
sultants, financial firms, lawyers and accountants, and technical
specialist groups. Local government agencies, consumer groups,
industry associations and NGOs may ensure that technology
meets local needs and demand. This organizational infrastructure
can help reduce but will not eliminate risks arising from defi-
ciencies in legal systems. Although many actions that facilitate the
growth of such networks are already underway, initiatives of
particular importance to EST transfer include:

"Governments, through, inter alia, sound economic policy and
regulatory frameworks, transparency and political stability, can
create an enabling environment for private and public sector
technology transfers. Although many ESTs are in common use
and could be diffused through commercial channels, their spread
is hampered by risks such as those arising from weak legal pro-
tection and inadequate regulation in developed countries, devel-
oping countries and countries with economies in transition. But
many technologies that can mitigate emissions or contribute to
adaptation to climate change are not as yet commercially viable.
Beyond an enabling environment, it will take extra efforts to
develop and enhance the transfer of those potentially viable
ESTs. The following actions could increase the flow of ESTs and

close monitoring of health outcomes and training of health

Government, community, and international organizations, includ-
ing conservation organizations, have dominated technology trans-
fer in the forestry sector. More recently, private establishments
have been making inroads. Transfer of practices such as sus-
tainable forest management (including reduced-impact logging,
certification techniques and silvicultural practices), recycling, bio-
energy technologies and agroforestry can contribute to the
mitigation of carbon dioxide emissions. Establishing clear
property rights, participatory forest management, use of financial
incentives and disincentives, optimal use of regulations, and
strengthening of monitoring and evaluating institutions are
government actions that can promote their transfer.

"Technology transfer should focus on proven technologies for
coastal adaptation, including indigenous solutions. Wetland
restoration and preservation are examples of such proven adap-
tation technologies. Effective transfers of adaptation tech-
nologies are part of integrated coastal-management plans or
programmes, that utilize local expertise. Because coastal
management is predominantly a public activity, technology
transfer in coastal zones is driven by governments. Fragmented
organizational and institutional relationships, and lack of access
to financial means are major barriers to the transfer of coastal
adaptation technologies. Coastal adaptation programmes, based
on strong partnership between existing institutions, can
provide an effective response.

voluntary agreements between government and industry can
stimulate the development of efficient technologies and can lead

bilities are important to provide information and capabilities
to successfully transfer ESTs. Well-defined clearing houses can
be useful in disseminating information to improve energy
efficiency, especially with respect to small- and medium-sized
enterprises that often do not have the resources to assess tech-
nologies. Long-term support for capacity building is essential,
stressing the need for the cooperation of equipment and software

"Mitigation technologies are available and can be readily deployed.
Roles of governments, private sector, and other organizations are
changing. National governments can act as facilitators of munici-
pal, private sector, and community-based initiatives. The private
sector plays an increasing role, because meeting future waste
management needs depends on expanded private investment.
The involvement of community organizations is also increasing
as the link between community support and project sustain-
ability has become clear. It is important that projects emphasize
the deployment of locally-appropriate technologies, and minimize
the development of conventional large, integrated waste manage-
ment systems in situations where lower cost, simpler alternatives
can be used without compromising public health and environ-

Development of appropriate information bases on, inter alia,
improved crop species and varieties, irrigation facilities, different
tillage and crop management systems, and livestock manure treat-
ment, including biogas recovery systems, can facilitate and promote
the transfer of adaptation and mitigation technologies within and
across countries and integration with indigenous solutions.
Governments can create incentives for the transfer of ESTs by
improving national agricultural information systems to disseminate
information on ESTs, and expanding credit and savings schemes
to assist farmers to manage the increased variability in their envi-
ronment. The existing Consultative Group on International
Agricultural Research (CGIAR) system may be one possible
model for an R&D network among countries to build such an
information base. Capacities to deal with climate change tech-
nologies and national agricultural research systems including those
that investigate carbon storage, and early warning systems, are
important elements. Efforts by developed countries and multi-
lateral agencies can be improved to enhance this R&D system.

"In general, the private sector plays a strong role in the transfer of
energy supply technologies based in oil and gas sources and
technology transfer mechanisms have been established for some
time. Restructuring of the electricity sector world-wide is
rapidly changing the direction of investments in the power
sector with growing participation of the private sector. At the same
time, the transfer of energy supply technologies for some other
conventional and renewable sources, which often depend on the
government to preserve or increase their presence in the market,
is restricted due to institutional and socio-economic barriers.
Nevertheless, the role of the government and multilateral banks
is important in every sector to foster and ensure conditions for
international financing, establish appropriate regulatory frame-
works and create conditions to couple new energy investments,
environmentally sound projects and sustainable development.
Enabling actions by governments to promote energy options,
including renewable resources, that are assisting to mitigate
climate change, can be crucial to mobilize private capital for
ESTs and raise increased attention to energy efficiency.
