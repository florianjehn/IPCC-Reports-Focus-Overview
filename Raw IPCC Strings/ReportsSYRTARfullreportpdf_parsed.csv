"Climate Change 2001: Synthesis Report provides a policy-relevant, but not policy-prescriptive, synthesis and integration of
information contained within the Third Assessment Report and also draws upon all previously approved and accepted IPCC
reports that address a broad range of key policy-relevant questions. For this reason it will be especially useful for
policymakers and researchers, and as a main or supplementary student textbook for courses in environmental studies,
meteorology, climatology, biology, ecology, and atmospheric chemistry.

"IPCC assessments attempt to answer such general questions as:
¢ Has the Earth’s climate changed as a result of human activities?
¢ In what ways is climate projected to change in the future?
¢ How vulnerable are agriculture, water supply, ecosystems, coastal infrastructure, and human health to different levels of
change in climate and sea level?
¢ What is the technical, economic, and market potential of options to adapt to climate change or reduce emissions of the

gases that influence climate?

"The climate change issue is part of the larger challenge of sustainable development.
As a result, climate policies can be more effective when consistently embedded
within broader strategies designed to make national and regional development
paths more sustainable. This occurs because the impact of climate variability and change,
climate policy responses, and associated socio-economic development will affect the ability of
countries to achieve sustainable development goals. Conversely, the pursuit of those goals will in
turn affect the opportunities for, and success of, climate policies. In particular, the socio-economic
and technological characteristics of different development paths will strongly affect emissions,
the rate and magnitude of climate change, climate change impacts, the capability to adapt, and the
capacity to mitigate.

"changes can be attributed to human influence and what part, if any,
can be attributed to natural phenomena? What is the basis for that
attribution?

(b) What is known about the environmental, social, and economic
consequences of climate changes since the pre-industrial era with
an emphasis on the last 50 years?

 

The Earth’s climate system has demonstrably changed on both global
and regional scales since the pre-industrial era, with some of these
changes attributable to human activities.

Human activities have increased the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse
gases and aerosols since the pre-industrial era. The atmospheric concentrations of key
anthropogenic greenhouse gases (i.e., carbon dioxide (CO,), methane (CH,), nitrous oxide (N,O),
and tropospheric ozone (O,)) reached their highest recorded levels in the 1990s, primarily due to
the combustion of fossil fuels, agriculture, and land-use changes (see Table SPM-1). The radiative
forcing from anthropogenic greenhouse gases is positive with a small uncertainty range; that from
the direct aerosol effects is negative and smaller; whereas the negative forcing from the indirect
effects of aerosols on clouds might be large but is not well quantified.

An increasing body of observations gives a collective picture of a warming world
and other changes in the climate system (see Table SPM-1).

Globally it is very likely that the 1990s was the warmest decade, and 1998 the
warmest year, in the instrumental record (1861-2000) (see Box SPM-1). The increase
in surface temperature over the 20th century for the Northern Hemisphere is likely to have been
greater than that for any other century in the last thousand years (see Table SPM-1). Insufficient
data are available prior to the year 1860 in the Southern Hemisphere to compare the recent warming
with changes over the last 1,000 years. Temperature changes have not been uniform globally but
have varied over regions and different parts of the lower atmosphere.

Where appropriate, the authors of the Third Assessment Report assigned confidence levels that represent
their collective judgment in the validity of a conclusion based on observational evidence, modeling
results, and theory that they have examined. The following words have been used throughout the text of
the Synthesis Report to the TAR relating to WGI findings: virtually certain (greater than 99% chance
that a result is true); very likely (90-99% chance); likely (66-90% chance); medium likelihood (33-66%
chance); unlikely (10-33% chance); very unlikely (1-10% chance); and exceptionally unlikely (less
than 1% chance). An explicit uncertainty range (+) is a /ikely range. Estimates of confidence relating to
WGII findings are: very high (95% or greater), high (67-95%), medium (33-67%), low (5—33%), and
very low (5% or less). No confidence levels were assigned in WGIII.

consistently find evidence for an anthropogenic signal in the climate record of the last 35 to 50
years. These studies include uncertainties in forcing due to anthropogenic sulfate aerosols and
natural factors (volcanoes and solar irradiance), but do not account for the effects of other types of
anthropogenic aerosols and land-use changes. The sulfate and natural forcings are negative over
this period and cannot explain the warming; whereas most of these studies find that, over the last

"Changes in sea level, snow cover, ice extent, and precipitation are consistent with
a warming climate near the Earth’s surface. Examples of these include a more active
hydrological cycle with more heavy precipitation events and shifts in precipitation, widespread
retreat of non-polar glaciers, increases in sea level and ocean-heat content, and decreases in snow
cover and sea-ice extent and thickness (see Table SPM-1). For instance, it is very likely that the
20th century warming has contributed significantly to the observed sea-level rise, through thermal
expansion of seawater and widespread loss of land ice. Within present uncertainties, observations
and models are both consistent with a lack of significant acceleration of sea-level rise during the
20th century. There are no demonstrated changes in overall Antarctic sea-ice extent from the years
1978 to 2000. In addition, there are conflicting analyses and insufficient data to assess changes in
intensities of tropical and extra-tropical cyclones and severe local storm activity in the mid-latitudes.
Some of the observed changes are regional and some may be due to internal climate variations,
natural forcings, or regional human activities rather than attributed solely to global human influence.

"Figure SPM-2: Simulating the Earth’s temperature variations (°C) and comparing the results to the

can be used to simulate the temperature changes that occur from both natural and anthropogenic causes. The
simulations represented by the band in (a) were done with only natural forcings: solar variation and volcanic
activity. Those encompassed by the band in (b) were done with anthropogenic forcings: greenhouse gases
and an estimate of sulfate aerosols. And those encompassed by the band in (c) were done with both natural

provides a plausible explanation for a substantial part of the observed temperature changes over the past
century, but the best match with observations is obtained in (c) when both natural and anthropogenic factors
are included. These results show that the forcings included are sufficient to explain the observed changes, but

typically 5 to 20%. It is likely that precipitation will increase over high-latitude regions in both
summer and winter. Increases are also projected over northern mid-latitudes, tropical Africa, and
Antarctica in winter, and in southern and eastern Asia in summer. Australia, Central America, and
southern Africa show consistent decreases in winter rainfall. Larger year-to-year variations in
precipitation are very likely over most areas where an increase in mean precipitation is projected.

Glaciers are projected to continue their widespread retreat during the 21st century.
Northern Hemisphere snow cover, permafrost, and sea-ice extent are projected to decrease further.
The Antarctic ice sheet is likely to gain mass, while the Greenland ice sheet is likely to lose mass
(see Question 4).

Global mean sea level is projected to rise by 0.09 to 0.88 m between the years 1990
and 2100, for the full range of SRES scenarios, but with significant regional
variations. This rise is due primarily to thermal expansion of the oceans and melting of glaciers
and ice caps. For the periods 1990 to 2025 and 1990 to 2050, the projected rises are 0.03 to 0.14
m and 0.05 to 0.32 m, respectively.

Projected climate change will have beneficial and adverse effects on
both environmental and socio-economic systems, but the larger the
changes and rate of change in climate, the more the adverse effects
predominate.

The severity of the adverse impacts will be larger for greater cumulative emissions
of greenhouse gases and associated changes in climate (medium confidence). While
beneficial effects can be identified for some regions and sectors for small amounts of climate change,
these are expected to diminish as the magnitude of climate change increases. In contrast many
identified adverse effects are expected to increase in both extent and severity with the degree of
climate change. When considered by region, adverse effects are projected to predominate for much
of the world, particularly in the tropics and subtropics.

Overall, climate change is projected to increase threats to human health, particularly
in lower income populations, predominantly within tropical/subtropical countries.
Climate change can affect human health directly (e.g., reduced cold stress in temperate countries
but increased heat stress, loss of life in floods and storms) and indirectly through changes in the
ranges of disease vectors (e.g., mosquitoes),’ water-borne pathogens, water quality, air quality,
and food availability and quality (medium to high confidence). The actual health impacts will be
strongly influenced by local environmental conditions and socio-economic circumstances, and by
the range of social, institutional, technological, and behavioral adaptations taken to reduce the full
range of threats to health.

Models of cereal crops indicate that in some temperate areas potential yields increase
with small increases in temperature but decrease with larger temperature changes
(medium to low confidence). |n most tropical and subtropical regions, potential yields
are projected to decrease for most projected increases in temperature (medium
confidence). Where there is also a large decrease in rainfall in subtropical and tropical dryland/
rainfed systems, crop yields would be even more adversely affected. These estimates include some
adaptive responses by farmers and the beneficial effects of CO, fertilization, but not the impact of
projected increases in pest infestations and changes in climate extremes. The ability of livestock
producers to adapt their herds to the physiological stresses associated with climate change is
poorly known. Warming of a few °C or more is projected to increase food prices globally, and may
increase the risk of hunger in vulnerable populations.

Climate change will exacerbate water shortages in many water-scarce areas of the
world. Demand for water is generally increasing due to population growth and economic
development, but is falling in some countries because of increased efficiency of use. Climate
change is projected to substantially reduce available water (as reflected by projected runoff) in
many of the water-scarce areas of the world, but to increase it in some other areas (medium
confidence) (see Figure SPM-4). Freshwater quality generally would be degraded by higher water
temperatures (high confidence), but this may be offset in some regions by increased flows.

The aggregated market sector effects, measured as changes in gross domestic
product (GDP), are estimated to be negative for many developing countries for all
magnitudes of global mean temperature increases studied (low confidence), and
are estimated to be mixed for developed countries for up to a few °C warming (low
confidence) and negative for warming beyond a few degrees (medium to low
confidence). The estimates generally exclude the effects of changes in climate variability and
extremes, do not account for the effects of different rates of climate change, only partially account
for impacts on goods and services that are not traded in markets, and treat gains for some as
canceling out losses for others.

Populations that inhabit small islands and/or low-lying coastal areas are at particular
risk of severe social and economic effects from sea-level rise and storm surges.
Many human settlements will face increased risk of coastal flooding and erosion, and tens of
millions of people living in deltas, in low-lying coastal areas, and on small islands will face risk of
displacement. Resources critical to island and coastal populations such as beaches, freshwater,
fisheries, coral reefs and atolls, and wildlife habitat would also be at risk.

The impacts of climate change will fall disproportionately upon developing countries
and the poor persons within all countries, and thereby exacerbate inequities in
health status and access to adequate food, clean water, and other resources.
Populations in developing countries are generally exposed to relatively high risks of adverse impacts
from climate change. In addition, poverty and other factors create conditions of low adaptive
capacity in most developing countries.

can be changed by policies and the choices made by individuals. The capacity for
implementing climate change policies depends on the interaction between social and economic
structures and values, institutions, technologies, and established infrastructure. The combined
system generally evolves relatively slowly. It can respond quickly under pressure, although
sometimes at high cost (e.g., if capital equipment is prematurely retired). If change is slower, there
may be lower costs due to technological advancement or because capital equipment value is fully
depreciated. There is typically a delay of years to decades between perceiving a need to respond
to a major challenge, planning, researching and developing a solution, and implementing it.

impacts, adaptation, and mitigation at a regional and global level.

 

The projected rate and magnitude of warming and sea-level rise can
be lessened by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The greater the reductions in emissions and the earlier they are introduced, the smaller
and slower the projected warming and the rise in sea levels. Future climate change is
determined by historic, current, and future emissions. Differences in projected temperature changes
between scenarios that include greenhouse gas emission reductions and those that do not tend to
be small for the first few decades but grow with time if the reductions are sustained.

Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and the gases that control their concentration
would be necessary to stabilize radiative forcing. For example, for the most important
anthropogenic greenhouse gas, carbon cycle models indicate that stabilization of atmospheric
CO, concentrations at 450, 650, or 1,000 ppm would require global anthropogenic CO, emissions
to drop below the year 1990 levels, within a few decades, about a century, or about 2 centuries,
respectively, and continue to decrease steadily thereafter (see Figure SPM-6). These models illustrate
that emissions would peak in about | to 2 decades (450 ppm) and roughly a century (1,000 ppm)
from the present. Eventually CO, emissions would need to decline to a very small fraction of
current emissions. The benefits of different stabilization levels are discussed later in Question 6
and the costs of these stabilization levels are discussed in Question 7.

until the year 2100 and are constant thereafter, are estimated to limit global mean
temperature increase to 3.5°C or less through the year 2100. Global average surface
temperature is estimated to increase 1.2 to 3.5°C by the year 2100 for profiles that eventually
stabilize the concentration of CO, at levels from 450 to 1,000 ppm. Thus, although all of the CO,
concentration stabilization profiles analyzed would prevent, during the 21st century, much of the
upper end of the SRES projections of warming (1.4 to 5.8°C by the year 2100), it should be noted
that for most of the profiles the concentration of CO, would continue to rise beyond the year 2100.
The equilibrium temperature rise would take many centuries to reach, and ranges from 1.5 to
3.9°C above the year 1990 levels for stabilization at 450 ppm, and 3.5 to 8.7°C above the year
1990 levels for stabilization at 1,000 ppm.° Furthermore, for a specific temperature stabilization
target there is a very wide range of uncertainty associated with the required stabilization level of
greenhouse gas concentrations (see Figure SPM-7). The level at which CO, concentration is required
to be stabilized for a given temperature target also depends on the levels of the non-CO, gases.

Sea level and ice sheets would continue to respond to warming for many centuries
after greenhouse gas concentrations have been stabilized. The projected range of sea-
level rise due to thermal expansion at equilibrium is 0.5 to 2 m for an increase in CO, concentration
from the pre-industrial level of 280 to 560 ppm and 1| to 4 m for an increase in CO, concentration
from 280 to 1,120 ppm. The observed rise over the 20th century was 0.1 to 0.2 m. The projected
rise would be larger if the effect of increases in other greenhouse gas concentrations were to be taken
into account. There are other contributions to sea-level rise over time scales of centuries to millennia.
Models assessed in the TAR project sea-level rise of several meters from polar ice sheets (see
Question 4) and land ice even for stablization levels of 550 ppm CO,-equivalent.

Reducing emissions of greenhouse gases to stabilize their atmospheric
concentrations would delay and reduce damages caused by climate
change.

Greenhouse gas emission reduction (mitigation) actions would lessen the pressures
on natural and human systems from climate change. Slower rates of increase in global
mean temperature and sea level would allow more time for adaptation. Consequently, mitigation
actions are expected to delay and reduce damages caused by climate change and thereby generate
environmental and socio-economic benefits. Mitigation actions and their associated costs are
assessed in the response to Question 7.

Mitigation actions to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases at
lower levels would generate greater benefits in terms of less damage. Stabilization at
lower levels reduces the risk of exceeding temperature thresholds in biophysical systems where
these exist. Stabilization of CO, at, for example, 450 ppm is estimated to yield an increase in global
mean temperature in the year 2100 that is about 0.75 to 1.25°C less than is estimated for stabilization
at 1,000 ppm (see Figure SPM-7). At equilibrium the difference is about 2 to 5°C. The geographical
extent of the damage to or loss of natural systems, and the number of systems affected, which increase
with the magnitude and rate of climate change, would be lower for a lower stabilization level.
Similarly, for a lower stabilization level the severity of impacts from climate extremes is expected to be
less, fewer regions would suffer adverse net market sector impacts, global aggregate impacts would
be smaller, and risks of large-scale, high-impact events would be reduced.

have been made in understanding the qualitative character of the impacts of climate change. Because
of uncertainty in climate sensitivity, and uncertainty about the geographic and seasonal patterns of

impacts of climate change cannot be uniquely determined for individual emission scenarios. There
are also uncertainties about key processes and sensitivities and adaptive capacities of systems to
changes in climate. In addition, impacts such as the changes in the composition and function of
ecological systems, species extinction, and changes in human health, and disparity in the distribution
of impacts across different populations, are not readily expressed in monetary or other common

Adaptation can complement mitigation in a cost-effective strategy to reduce climate

in the atmosphere at a low level, will neither altogether prevent climate change or sea-level rise
nor altogether prevent their impacts. Many reactive adaptations will occur in response to the
changing climate and rising seas and some have already occurred. In addition, the development of
planned adaptation strategies to address risks and utilize opportunities can complement mitigation

"although trade-offs between issues may exist. Multiple environmental and development
goals can be achieved by adopting a broad range of technologies, policies, and measures that explicitly
recognize the inextricable linkages among environmental problems and human needs. Addressing
the need for energy, while reducing local and regional air pollution and global climate change
cost-effectively, requires an interdisciplinary assessment of the synergies and trade-offs of meeting
energy requirements in the most economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable manner.
Greenhouse gas emissions, as well as local and regional pollutants, could be reduced through more
efficient use of energy and increasing the share of lower carbon-emitting fossil fuels, advanced fossil-
fuel technologies (e.g., highly efficient combined cycle gas turbines, fuel cells, and combined heat and
power) and renewable energy technologies (e.g., increased use of environmentally sound biofuels,
hydropower, solar, wind- and wave-power). Further, the increase of greenhouse gas concentrations
in the atmosphere can be reduced also by enhanced uptake of carbon through, for example,
afforestation, reforestation, slowing deforestation, and improved forest, rangeland, wetland, and
cropland management, which can have favorable effects on biodiversity, food production, land,
and water resources. Reducing vulnerability to climate change can often reduce vulnerability to
other environmental stresses and vice versa. In some cases there will be trade-offs. For example,
in some implementations, monoculture plantations could decrease local biodiversity.

Natural, technical, and social sciences can provide essential information and
evidence needed for decisions on what constitutes “dangerous anthropogenic
interference” with the climate system. At the same time, such decisions are
value judgments determined through socio-political processes, taking into
account considerations such as development, equity, and sustainability, as
well as uncertainties and risk. Scientific evidence helps to reduce uncertainty and
increase knowledge, and can serve as an input for considering precautionary measures.!
Decisions are based on risk assessment, and lead to risk management choices by decision
makers, about actions and policies.”

The basis for determining what constitutes “dangerous anthropogenic
interference” will vary among regions, depending both on the local nature
and consequences of climate change impacts, and also on the adaptive
capacity available to cope with climate change. It also depends upon
mitigative capacity, since the magnitude and the rate of change are both
important. The consequent types of adaptation responses that will be selected depend on
the effectiveness of various adaptation or mitigation responses in reducing vulnerabilities
and improving the sustainability of life-support systems. There is no universally applicable
best set of policies; rather, it is important to consider both the robustness of different policy
measures against a range of possible future worlds, and the degree to which such climate-
specific policies can be integrated with broader sustainable development policies.

The Third Assessment Report (TAR) provides an assessment of new scientific
information and evidence as an input for policy makers in their determination
of what constitutes “dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate
system” with regard to: (1) the magnitudes and rates of changes in the climate system, (2)
the ecological and socio-economic impacts of climate change, and (3) the potential for
achieving a broad range of levels of concentrations through mitigation and information
about how adaptation can reduce vulnerability.

With regard to the magnitudes and rates of changes in the climate system,
the TAR provides scenario-based projections of future concentrations of
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, global and regional patterns of changes
and rates of change in temperature, precipitation, and sea level, and changes
in extreme climate events. It also examines possibilities for abrupt and irreversible
changes in ocean circulation and the major ice sheets.

The TAR reviews the biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate
change. The TAR articulates five reasons for concern, regarding:

¢ Risks to unique and threatened systems

Risks associated with extreme weather events

¢ The distribution of impacts

¢ Aggregate impacts

¢ Risks of large-scale, high-impact events.
Of great significance here is an assessment of the likelihood of the critical thresholds at
which natural and human systems exhibit large-scale, abrupt, or irreversible changes in
their response to a changing climate. Since no single indicator (e.g., a monetary unit) captures

 

 

 

that ing, od At 92 2 OF tha Tleited Natiane
"	List
"1.10

the range of relevant risks presented by climate change, a variety of analytical approaches
and criteria are required to assess impacts and facilitate decisions about risk management.

With regard to strategies for addressing climate change, the TAR provides
an assessment of the potential for achieving different levels of concentrations
through mitigation and information about how adaptation can reduce
vulnerability. The causality works in both directions. Different stabilization levels result
from different emission scenarios, which are connected to underlying development paths.
In turn, these development paths strongly affect adaptive capacity in any region. In this
way adaptation and mitigation strategies are dynamically connected with changes in the
climate system and the prospects for ecosystem adaptation, food production, and sustainable
economic development.

An integrated view of climate change considers the dynamics of the complete cycle of
interlinked causes and effects across all sectors concerned. Figure 1-1 shows the cycle,
from the underlying driving forces of population, economy, technology, and governance,
through greenhouse gas and other emissions, changes in the physical climate system,
biophysical and human impacts, to adaptation and mitigation, and back to the driving forces.
The figure presents a schematic view of an ideal “integrated assessment” framework, in
which all the parts of the climate change problem interact mutually. Changes in one part of
the cycle influence other components in a dynamic manner, through multiple paths. The
TAR assesses new policy-relevant information and evidence with regard to all quadrants
of Figure 1-1. In particular, a new contribution has been to fill in the bottom righthand
quadrant of the figure by exploring alternative development paths and their relationship to
greenhouse gas emissions, and by undertaking preliminary work on the linkage between
adaptation, mitigation, and development paths. However, the TAR does not achieve a fully
integrated assessment of climate change, because of the incomplete state of knowledge.

Climate change decision making is essentially a sequential process under
general uncertainties. Decision making has to deal with uncertainties including the
risk of non-linear and/or irreversible changes and entails balancing the risk of either
insufficient or excessive action, and involves careful consideration of the consequences
(both environmental and economic), their likelihood, and society’s attitude towards risk.
The latter is likely to vary from country to country and from generation to generation. The
relevant question is “what is the best course for the near term given the expected long-term
climate change and accompanying uncertainties.”

Climate change impacts are part of the larger question of how complex social,
economic, and environmental subsystems interact and shape prospects for
sustainable development. There are multiple links. Economic development affects
ecosystem balance and, in turn, is affected by the state of the ecosystem; poverty can be
both a result and a cause of environmental degradation; material- and energy-intensive life
styles and continued high levels of consumption supported by non-renewable resources
and rapid population growth are not likely to be consistent with sustainable development
paths; and extreme socio-economic inequality within communities and between nations
may undermine the social cohesion that would promote sustainability and make policy
responses more effective. At the same time, socio-economic and technology policy decisions
made for non-climate-related reasons have significant implications for climate policy and
climate change impacts, as well as for other environmental issues (see Question 8). In
addition, critical impact thresholds and vulnerability to climate change impacts are directly
connected to environmental, social, and economic conditions and institutional capacity.

As a result, the effectiveness of climate policies can be enhanced when they
are integrated with broader strategies designed to make national and regional
development paths more sustainable. This occurs because of the impacts of natural

"igure 1-1: Climate change — an integrated framework. Schematic and simplified representation of an integrated assessment framework for
onsidering anthropogenic climate change. The yellow arrows show a full clockwise cycle of cause and effect among the four quadrants shown
| the figure, while the blue arrow indicates the societal response to climate change impacts. For both developed and developing countries,
ach socio-economic development path explored in the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios has driving forces which give rise to
missions of greenhouse gases, aerosols, and precursors—with carbon dioxide (CO,) being the most important. The greenhouse gas emissions
ccumulate in the atmosphere, changing concentrations and disturbing the natural balances, depending on physical processes such as
olar radiation, cloud formation, and rainfall. The aerosols also give rise to air pollution (e.g., acid rain) that damage human and the natural
ystems (not shown). The enhanced greenhouse effect will initiate climate changes well into the future with associated impacts on the
atural and human systems. There is a possibility of some feedback between the changes in these systems and the climate (not shown),
uch as albedo effects from changing land use, and other, perhaps larger, interactions between the systems and atmospheric emissions (e.g.,
ffects of changes in land use (again not shown)). These changes will ultimately have effects on socio-economic development paths. The
evelopment paths also have direct effects on the natural systems (shown by the anti-clockwise arrow from the development box) such as
hanges in land use leading to deforestation. This figure illustrates that the various dimensions of the climate change issue exist in a dynamic
ycle, characterized by significant time delays. Both emissions and impacts, for example, are linked in complex ways to underlying socio-
conomic and technological development paths. A major contribution of the TAR has been to explicitly consider the bottom righthand domain
shown as a rectangle) by examining the relationships between greenhouse gas emissions and development paths (in SRES), and by assessing
reliminary work on the linkage between adaptation, mitigation, and development paths (WGII and WGIll). However, the TAR does not achieve
fully integrated assessment of climate change, since not all components of the cycle were able to be linked dynamically. Adaptation and
itigation are shown as modifying the effects shown in the figure.

includes shifts in the frequency and magnitude of sporadic weather events as well as the
slow continuous rise in global mean surface temperature. Thus the discussion here includes
climate-weather variations on all temporal and spatial scales, ranging from brief-lived severe
storms to seasonal El Nifio events, decadal droughts, and century shifts in temperature and
ice cover. Although short-term climate variations are considered predominantly natural at present,
their impacts are discussed in this question because they represent a class of changes that
may become more prevalent in a future climate perturbed by human activities (see Question
4). Attribution is used here as the process of establishing the most likely causes for the
detected change with some defined level of confidence. The discussion includes both climate
change that is attributable to human influence and climate change that may at present be
natural but might in the future be modified through human influence (see Box 3-1).

The Earth’s climate system has demonstrably changed on both
global and regional scales since the pre-industrial era, with some
of these changes attributable to human activities.

Emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols due to human
activities continue to alter the atmosphere in ways that are
expected to affect the climate (see Table 2-1).

Concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases and their radiative forcings
have generally increased over the 20th century as a result of human activities.
Almost all greenhouse gases reached their highest recorded levels in the 1990s and continue
to increase (see Figure 2-1). Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO,) and methane (CH,) have
varied substantially during glacial-interglacial cycles over the past 420,000 years, but even
the largest of these earlier values are much less than their current atmospheric concentrations.
In terms of radiative forcing by greenhouse gases emitted through human activity, CO, and
CH, are the first and second most important, respectively. From the years 1750 to 2000, the
concentration of CO, increased by 31+4%, and that of CH, rose by 151+25% (see Box 2-1
and Figure 2-1). These rates of increase are unprecedented. Fossil-fuel burning released on
average 5.4 Gt C yr“! during the 1980s, increasing to 6.3 Gt C yr! during the 1990s. About
three-quarters of the increase in atmospheric CO, during the 1990s was caused by fossil-
fuel burning, with land-use change including deforestation responsible for the rest. Over
the 19th and much of the 20th century the terrestrial biosphere has been a net source of
atmospheric CO,, but before the end of the 20th century it had become a net sink. The
increase in CH, can be identified with emissions from energy use, livestock, rice agriculture,
and landfills. Increases in the concentrations of other greenhouse gases—particularly
tropospheric ozone (O,), the third most important—are directly attributable to fossil-fuel
combustion as well as other industrial and agricultural emissions.

air trapped in ice (symbols) matches up with continuous atmospheric

In the lowest 8 km of the atmosphere the global temperature increase from
the 1950s to the year 2000, about 0.1°C per decade, has been similar to that
at the surface. For the period 1979-2000 both satellite and weather balloon measurements
show nearly identical warming over North America (0.3°C per decade) and Europe (0.4°C
per decade) for both surface and lower atmosphere, but distinct differences over some land
areas and particularly in the tropical regions (0.10+0.10°C per decade for surface versus
0.06+0.16°C per decade for the lower atmosphere). Temperatures of the surface and lower
atmosphere are influenced differently by factors such as stratospheric ozone depletion,
atmospheric aerosols, and the El Nifio phenomenon. In addition, spatial sampling techniques

"2.9 There is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming
observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities.

2.10 The observed warming over the 20th century is unlikely to be entirely natural
in origin. The increase in surface temperatures over the last 100 years is very unlikely to
be due to internal variability alone. Reconstructions of climate data for the last 1,000 years
also indicate that this 20th century warming was unusual and unlikely to be the response to
natural forcing alone: That is, volcanic eruptions and variation in solar irradiance do not
explain the warming in the latter half of the 20th century (see Figure 2-4a), but they may
have contributed to the observed warming in the first half.

2.11 Inthe light of new evidence and taking into account the remaining uncertainties,
most of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due
to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations. Detection and attribution studies
(including greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols as anthropogenic forcing) consistently
find evidence for an anthropogenic signal in the climate record of the last 35 to 50 years, despite
uncertainties in forcing due to anthropogenic sulfate aerosols and natural factors (volcanoes
and solar irradiance). The sulfate and natural forcings are negative over this period and
cannot explain the warming (see Figure 2-4a); whereas most of these studies find that, over
the last 50 years, the estimated rate and magnitude of warming due to increasing greenhouse
gases alone are comparable with, or larger than, the observed warming (Figure 2-4b). The
best agreement for the 1860-2000 record is found when the above anthropogenic and
natural forcing factors are combined (see Figure 2-4c). This result does not exclude the
possibility that other forcings may also contribute, and some known anthropogenic factors
(e.g., organic carbon, black carbon (soot), biomass aerosols, and some changes in land
use) have not been used in these detection and attribution studies. Estimates of the magnitude
and geographic distribution of these additional anthropogenic forcings vary considerably.

2.12 Changes in sea level, snow cover, ice extent, and precipitation
are consistent with a warming climate near the Earth’s surface
(see Table 2-1). Some of these changes are regional and some may be due to internal
climate variations, natural forcings, or regional human activities rather than attributed solely
to global human influence.

2.13 It is very likely that the 20th century warming has contributed significantly to
the observed rise in global average sea level and increase in ocean-heat
content. Warming drives sea-level rise through thermal expansion of seawater and
widespread loss of land ice. Based on tide gauge records, after correcting for land
movements, the average annual rise was between | and 2 mm during the 20th century. The
very few long records show that it was less during the 19th century (see Figure 2-5). Within
present uncertainties, observations and models are both consistent with a lack of significant
acceleration of sea-level rise during the 20th century. The observed rate of sea-level rise
during the 20th century is consistent with models. Global ocean-heat content has increased
since the late 1950s, the period with adequate observations of subsurface ocean temperatures.

2.14 Snow cover and ice extent have decreased. It is very likely that the extent of snow
cover has decreased by about 10% on average in the Northern Hemisphere since the late
1960s (mainly through springtime changes over America and Eurasia) and that the annual
duration of lake- and river-ice cover in the mid- and high latitudes of the Northern
Hemisphere has been reduced by about 2 weeks over the 20th century. There has also been
a widespread retreat of mountain glaciers in non-polar regions during the 20th century. It is
likely that Northern Hemisphere spring and summer sea-ice extent has decreased by about
10 to 15% from the 1950s to the year 2000 and that Arctic sea-ice thickness has declined
by about 40% during late summer and early autumn in the last 3 decades of the 20th
century. While there is no change in overall Antarctic sea-ice extent from 1978 to 2000 in
"	List
"parallel with global mean surface temperature increase, regional warming in the Antarctic
Peninsula coincided with the collapse of the Prince Gustav and parts of the Larsen ice
shelves during the 1990s, but the loss of these ice shelves has had little direct impact.

Precipitation has very likely increased during the 20th century by 5 to 10%
over most mid- and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere continents,
but in contrast, rainfall has likely decreased by 3% on average over much of the subtropical
land areas (see Figure 2-6a). Increasing global mean surface temperature is very likely to
lead to changes in precipitation and atmospheric moisture because of changes in atmospheric
circulation, a more active hydrologic cycle, and increases in the water-holding capacity
throughout the atmosphere. There has likely been a 2 to 4% increase in the frequency of
heavy precipitation events in the mid- and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere over
the latter half of the 20th century. There were relatively small long-term increases over the
20th century in land areas experiencing severe drought or severe wetness, but in many
regions these changes are dominated by inter-decadal and multi-decadal climate variability
with no significant trends evident over the 20th century.

Changes have also occurred in other important aspects of
climate (see Table 2-1).

Over the 20th century there has been a consistent, large-scale warming of both
the land and ocean surface, with largest increases in temperature over the
mid- and high latitudes of northern continents. The warming of land surface faster
than ocean surface from the years 1976 to 2000 (see Figure 2-6b) is consistent both with the
observed changes in natural climate variations, such as the North Atlantic and Arctic Oscillations,
and with the modeled pattern of greenhouse gas warming. As described below, statistically
significant associations between regional warming and observed changes in biological systems
have been documented in freshwater, terrestrial, and marine environments on all continents.

Warm episodes of the El Nifio Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon have
been more frequent, persistent, and intense since the mid-1970s, compared
with the previous 100 years. ENSO consistently affects regional variations of precipitation
and temperature over much of the tropics, subtropics, and some mid-latitude areas. It is not
obvious from models, however, that a warmer world would have a greater frequency of
occurrence of El Nifio events.

Some important aspects of climate appear not to have changed. A few areas of
the globe have not warmed in recent decades, mainly over some parts of the Southern
Hemisphere oceans and parts of Antarctica (see Figure 2-6b). Antarctic sea-ice extent has
stayed almost stable or even increased since 1978, the period of reliable satellite
measurements. Current analyses are unable to draw conclusions about the likelihood of

changes 1n the frequency of tornadoes, thunder days, or hail events for the limited regions
that have been studied. In addition, insufficient data and conflicting analyses prevent an
assessment of changes in intensities of tropical and extra-tropical cyclones and severe
local storm activity in the mid-latitudes.

Observed changes in regional climate over the past 50 years have
affected biological and hydrological systems in many parts of
the world (see Table 2-1).

There has been a discernible impact of regional climate change, particularly
increases in temperature, on biological systems in the 20th century. In many
parts of the world the observed changes in these systems’, either anthropogenic or natural,
are coherent across diverse localities and are consistent in direction with the expected effects
of regional changes in temperature. The probability that the observed changes in the expected
direction (with no reference to magnitude) could occur by chance alone is negligible. Such
systems include, for example, species distributions, population sizes, and the timing of
reproduction or migration events. These observations implicate regional climate change as
a prominent contributing causal factor. There have been observed changes in the types
(e.g., fires, droughts, blowdowns), intensity, and frequency of disturbances that are affected
by regional climatic change (either anthropogenic or natural) and land-use practices, and
they in turn affect the productivity of and species composition within an ecosystem,

particularly at high latitudes and high altitudes. Frequency of pests and disease outbreaks
have also changed, especially in forested systems, and can be linked to changes in climate.
In some regions of Africa, the combination of regional climate changes (Sahelian drought)
and anthropogenic stresses has led to decreased cereal crop production since the year 1970.
There are some positive aspects of warming: For example, the growing season across Europe
has lengthened by about 11 days from the years 1959 to 1993, and energy consumption for
heating in winter has decreased.

Coral reefs are adversely affected by rising sea surface temperatures. Increasing
sea surface temperatures have been recorded in much of the tropical oceans over the past
several decades. Many corals have undergone major, although often partially reversible,
bleaching episodes when sea surface temperatures rise by 1°C in any one season, and
extensive mortality occurs for a 3°C rise. This typically occurs during El Nifio events and
is exacerbated by rising sea surface temperatures. These bleaching events are often associated
with other stresses such as pollution.

Changes in marine systems, particularly fish populations, have been linked
to large-scale climate oscillations. The El Nifio affects fisheries off the coasts of
South America and Africa and the decadal oscillations in the Pacific are linked to decline
of fisheries off the west coast of North America.

Changes in stream flow, floods, and droughts have been observed. Evidence
of regional climate change impacts on elements of the hydrological cycle suggest that
warmer temperatures lead to intensification of the hydrological cycle. Peak stream flow
has shifted back from spring to late winter in large parts of eastern Europe, European
Russia, and North America in the last decades. The increasing frequency of droughts and
floods in some areas is related to variations in climate—for example, droughts in Sahel and
in northeast and southern Brazil, and floods in Colombia and northwest Peru.

There are preliminary indications that some human systems
have been affected by recent increases in floods and droughts.
The rising socio-economic costs related to weather damage and
to regional variations in climate suggest increasing vulnerability
to climate change (see Table 2-1).

Extreme weather or climatic events cause substantial, and increasing, damage.
Extreme events are currently a major source of climate-related impacts. For example, heavy
losses of human life, property damage, and other environmental damages were recorded
during the El Nifio event of the years 1997-1998. The impacts of climatic extremes and
variability are a major concern. Preliminary indications suggest that some social and
economic systems have been affected by recent increases in floods and droughts, with
increases in economic losses for catastrophic weather events. Because these systems are
also affected by changes in socio-economic factors such as demographic shifts and land-
use changes, quantifying the relative impacts of climate change (either anthropogenic or
natural) and of socio-economic factors is difficult. For example, direct costs of global
catastrophic weather-related losses, corrected for inflation, have risen an order of magnitude
from the 1950s to the 1990s (see Figure 2-7), and costs for non-catastrophic weather events
have grown similarly. The number of weather-related catastrophic events has risen three
times faster than the number of non-weather-related events, despite generally enhanced
disaster preparedness. Part of this observed upward trend in weather-related losses over
the past 50 years is linked to socio-economic factors (e.g., population growth, increased
wealth, urbanization in vulnerable areas), and part is linked to regional climatic factors
(e.g., changes in precipitation, flooding events).

"adjusted) from the 1950s to the 1990s, much faster than can be accounted for with simple inflation. The
insured portion of these losses rose from a negligible level to about 23% in the 1990s. The total losses from small, non-catastrophic weather-
related events (not included here) are similar. Part of this observed upward trend in weather-related disaster losses over the past 50 years is

linked to socio-economic factors (e.g., population growth, increased wealth, urbanization in vulnerable areas), and part is linked to regional
climatic factors (e.g., changes in precipitation, flooding events).

The fraction of weather-related losses covered by insurance varies considerably
by region, and the uneven impacts of climatic hazards raise issues for development and
equity. Insurers pay only 5% of total economic losses today in Asia and South America,
10% in Africa, and about 30% in Australia, Europe, and North and Central America. The
fraction covered is typically much higher when just storm losses are considered, but flood-
and crop-related losses have much lower coverage. The balance of the losses are absorbed
by governments and affected individuals and organizations.

Climate-related health effects are observed. Many vector-, food-, and water-borne
infectious diseases are known to be sensitive to changes in climatic conditions. Extensive
experience makes clear that any increase in floods will increase the risk of drowning,
diarrheal and respiratory diseases, water-contamination diseases, and—in developing
countries—hunger and malnutrition (high confidence). Heat waves in Europe and North
America are associated with a significant increase in urban mortality, but warmer wintertime
temperatures also result in reduced wintertime mortality. In some cases health effects are
clearly related to recent climate changes, such as in Sweden where tick-borne encephalitis

The recognition and anticipation of adverse impacts of climate
change has led to both public and governmental responses.

As a consequence of observed and anticipated climate change, socio-
economic and policy responses have occurred in the last decade. These have
included stimulation of the renewable energy market, development of energy-efficiency
improvement programs enhanced by climate change concerns, integration of climate policies
into broader national policies, carbon taxes in several countries, domestic greenhouse gases
trading regimes in some countries, national and international voluntary agreements with
industries to increase energy efficiency or otherwise decrease greenhouse gas emissions,
creation of carbon exchange markets, public and political pressures for utilities to reduce
or offset carbon emissions from new energy projects, industry reconnaissance into approaches
to offset carbon emissions, and establishment of programs to assist the developing and
least developed countries reduce vulnerabilities and adapt to climate change and engage in
mitigation activities.

The greenhouse gas emissions scenarios used as the basis for the climate projections in the
TAR are those contained in the IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (see Box 3-1).
Because the SRES scenarios had only been available for a very short time prior to production
of the TAR, it was not possible to include impact assessments based on these scenarios.
Hence, the impacts assessments in the TAR use climate model results that tend to be based on
equilibrium climate change scenarios (e.g., 2xCO,), a relatively small number of experiments
using a 1% per year CO, increase transient scenario, or the scenarios used in the Second
Assessment Report (i.e., the IS92 series). The challenge in answering this question therefore
is to try and map these impact results onto the climate change results, which have used the
SRES scenarios. This, by necessity, requires various approximations to be made and in
many cases only qualitative conclusions can be drawn. Projections of changes in climate
variability, extreme events, and abrupt/non-linear changes are covered in Question 4.

3.3

Carbon dioxide concentrations, globally averaged surface
temperature, and sea level are projected to increase under all
IPCC emissions scenarios during the 21st century.

All SRES emissions scenarios result in an increase in the atmospheric
concentration of CO,,. For the six illustrative SRES scenarios, the projected concentrations
of CO,—the primary anthropogenic greenhouse gas—in the year 2100 range from 540 to
970 ppm, compared to about 280 ppm in the pre-industrial era and about 368 ppm in the
year 2000 (see Figure 3-1f). These projections include the land and ocean climate feedbacks.
The different socio-economic assumptions (demographic, social, economic, and technological)
result in different levels of future greenhouse gases and aerosols. Further uncertainties,
especially regarding the persistence of the present removal processes (carbon sinks) and
the magnitude of the climate feedback on the terrestrial biosphere, cause a variation of
about —10 to +30% in the year 2100 concentration, around each scenario. The total range
is 490 to 1,260 ppm (75 to 350% above the year 1750 (pre-industrial) concentration).
"	List
" 

Changes in climate occur as a result of internal variability of the climate system and external factors
(both natural and as a result of human activities). Emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols due to
human activities change the composition of the atmosphere. Future emissions of greenhouse gases and
aerosols are determined by driving forces such as population, socio-economic development, and
technological change, and hence are highly uncertain. Scenarios are alternative images of how the future
might unfold and are an appropriate tool with which to analyze how driving forces may influence future
emission outcomes and to assess the associated uncertainties. The SRES scenarios, developed to update
the [S92 series, consist of six scenario groups, based on narrative storylines, which span a wide range of
these driving forces (see Figure 3-1). They are all plausible and internally consistent, and no
probabilities of occurrence are assigned. They encompass four combinations of demographic change,
social and economic development, and broad technological developments (A1B, A2, B1, B2). Two
further scenario groups, AlFI and AIT, explicitly explore alternative energy technology developments
to A1B (see Figure 3-1a). The resulting emissions of the greenhouse gases CO2, CHy, and N20, along
with SO, which leads to the production of sulfate aerosols, are shown in Figures 3-1b to 3-le; other
gases and particles are also important. These emissions cause changes in the concentrations of these
gases and aerosols in the atmosphere. The changes in the concentrations for the SRES scenarios are
shown in Figures 3-1f to 3-11. Note that for gases which stay in the atmosphere for a long period, such
as CO) shown in panel (f), the atmospheric concentration responds to changes in emissions relatively
slowly (e.g., see Figure 5-3); whereas for short-lived gases and aerosols, such as sulfate aerosols shown
in panel (i), the atmospheric concentration responds much more quickly. The influence of changes in the
concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols in the atmosphere on the climate system can broadly be
compared using the concept of radiative forcing, which is a measure of the influence a factor has in
altering the balance of incoming and outgoing energy in the Earth-atmosphere system. A positive
radiative forcing, such as that produced by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases, tends to
warm the surface; conversely a negative radiative forcing, which can arise from an increase in some
types of aerosols such as sulfate aerosols, tends to cool the surface. The radiative forcing resulting from
the increasing concentrations in panels (f) to (i) is shown in panel (j). Note that, as with the IS92
scenarios, all combinations of emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols in the SRES scenarios result
in increased radiative forcing.

* Complex physically based climate models are the main tool for projecting future climate change. In order to
explore the range of scenarios, these are complemented by simple climate models calibrated to yield an equivalent
response in temperature and sea level to complex climate models. These projections are obtained using a simple
climate model whose climate sensitivity and ocean heat uptake are calibrated to each of seven complex climate
models. The climate sensitivity used in the simple model ranges from 1.7 to 4.2°C, which is comparable to the
commonly accepted range of 1.5 to 4.5°C. For the atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (AOGCM)
experiments for the end of the 21st century (years 2071 to 2100) compared with the period 1961 to 1990, the
mean warming for SRES scenario A2 is 3.0°C with a range of 1.3 to 4.5°C, while for SRES scenario B2 the mean
warming is 2.2°C with a range of 0.9 to 3.4°C.

"3.4 Model calculations of the concentrations of the primary non-CO, greenhouse (
gases by year 2100 vary considerably across the six illustrative SRES scenarios.
For most cases, A1B, AIT, and B1 have the smallest increases, and Al FI and A2 the largest
(see Figures 3-1g and 3-1h).

3.5 The SRES scenarios include the possibility of either increases or decreases (
in anthropogenic aerosols, depending on the extent of fossil-fuel use and
policies to abate polluting emissions. As seen in Figure 3-1i, sulfate aerosol
concentrations are projected to fall below present levels by 2100 in all six illustrative
SRES scenarios. This would result in warming relative to present day. In addition, natural
aerosols (e.g., sea salt, dust, and emissions leading to sulfate and carbon aerosols) are
projected to increase as a result of changes in climate.

3.6 | Theglobally averaged surface temperature is projected to increase by 1.4 to (
5.8°C over the period 1990 to 2100 (see Figure 3-1k). This is about two to ten
times larger than the central value of observed warming over the 20th century
and the projected rate of warming is very likely to be without precedent during
at least the last 10,000 years, based on paleoclimate data (see Figure 9-1). For
the periods 1990 to 2025 and 1990 to 2050, the projected increases are 0.4 to 1.1°C and
0.8 to 2.6°C, respectively. These results are for the full range of 35 SRES scenarios, based
on a number of climate models.‘ Temperature increases are projected to be greater than
those in the SAR, which were about 1.0 to 3.5°C based on six IS92 scenarios. The higher
projected temperatures and the wider range are due primarily to lower projected SO,
emissions in the SRES scenarios relative to the IS92 scenarios, because of structural changes
in the energy system as well as concerns about local and regional air pollution.

3.7. By 2100, the range in the surface temperature response across different climate (
models for the same emissions scenario is comparable to the range across
different SRES emissions scenarios for a single climate model. Figure 3-1
shows that the SRES scenarios with the highest emissions result in the largest projected
temperature increases. Further uncertainties arise due to uncertainties in the radiative forcing.

The largest forcing uncertainty is that due to the sulfate aerosols.

"3.8 Globally averaged annual precipitation is projected to increase during the (
21st century. Globally averaged water vapor and evaporation are also projected to increase.

3.9 Global mean sea level is projected to rise by 0.09 to 0.88 m between the years (
1990 and 2100, for the full range of SRES scenarios (see Figure 3-11). For the
periods 1990 to 2025 and 1990 to 2050, the projected rises are 0.03 to 0.14 m and 0.05 to
0.32 m, respectively. This is due primarily to thermal expansion and loss of mass from
glaciers and ice caps. The range of sea-level rise presented in the SAR was 0.13 to 0.94 m,
based on the IS92 scenarios. Despite the higher temperature change projections in this
assessment, the sea-level projections are slightly lower, primarily due to the use of improved
models, which give a smaller contribution from glaciers and ice sheets.

3.10 Substantial differences are projected in regional changes in
climate and sea level, compared to the global mean change.

3.11 It is very likely that nearly all land areas will warm more rapidly than the (
global average, particularly those at northern high latitudes in winter. Most
notable of these is the warming in the northern regions of North America, and northern and
central Asia, which exceeds global mean warming in each model by more than 40%. In
contrast, the warming is less than the global mean change in south and southeast Asia in
summer and in southern South America in winter (see Figure 3-2).

3.12 At the regional scale, both increases and decreases in precipitation are (
projected, typically of 5 to 20%. It is likely that precipitation will increase over high
latitude regions in both summer and winter. Increases are also projected over northern
mid-latitudes, tropical Africa and Antarctica in winter, and in southern and eastern Asia in
summer. Australia, Central America, and southern Africa show consistent decreases in
winter rainfall. Larger year-to-year variations in precipitation are very likely over most
areas where an increase in mean precipitation is projected (see Figure 3-3).

3.13. The projected range of regional variation in sea-level change is substantial (
compared to projected global average sea-level rise, because the level of the
sea at the shoreline is determined by many factors (see Figure 3-4). Confidence
in the regional distribution of sea-level change from complex models is low because there
is little similarity between model results, although nearly all models project greater than
average rise in the Arctic Ocean and less than average rise in the Southern Ocean.

3.14 Glaciers and ice caps are projected to continue their widespread retreat during é
the 21st century. Northern Hemisphere snow cover, permafrost, and sea-ice extent are
projected to decrease further. The Antarctic ice sheet is likely to gain mass because of
greater precipitation, while the Greenland ice sheet is likely to lose mass because the increase
in runoff will exceed the precipitation increase. Concerns that have been expressed about
the stability of the West Antarctic ice sheet are covered in Question 4.

Projected climate change will have beneficial and adverse
environmental and socio-economic effects, but the larger the
changes and rate of change in climate, the more the adverse
effects predominate.

The impacts of climate change will be more severe the greater the cumulative
emissions of greenhouse gases (medium confidence). Climate change can have
beneficial as well as adverse effects, but adverse effects are projected to predominate for much
of the world. The various effects of climate change pose risks that increase with global mean
temperature. Many of these risks have been organized into five reasons for concern: threats
to endangered species and unique systems, damages from extreme climate events, effects
that fall most heavily on developing countries and the poor within countries, global aggregate
impacts, and large-scale high-impact events (see Box 3-2 and Figure 3-1). The effects of
climate change on human health, ecosystems, food production, water resources, small islands
and low-lying coastal regions, and aggregate market activities are summarized below. However,
note that future changes in the frequency or intensity of extreme events have not been taken
into account in most of these studies (see also Question 4).

Diversity in ecological systems is expected to be affected by climate change
and sea-level rise, with an increased risk of extinction of some vulnerable
species (high confidence). Significant disruptions of ecosystems from disturbances
such as fire, drought, pest infestation, invasion of species, storms, and coral bleaching
events are expected to increase (see Table 3-2). The stresses caused by climate change,

".17 Overall climate change is projected to increase threats to human health,
particularly in lower income populations predominantly within tropical/
subtropical countries. Climate change can affect human health through multiple pathways,
including direct effects (e.g., reduced cold stress in temperate countries but increased heat
stress, loss of life in floods and storms) and indirect effects that operate through changes in
the ranges of disease vectors (e.g., mosquitoes)°, water-borne pathogens, water quality, air
quality, food availability and quality (e.g., decreased protein content in some cereals), population
displacement, and economic disruption (medium to high confidence). Some effects may be
beneficial (e.g., reduced cold stress, and reduced disease transmission in some cases), but
the predominant effect is anticipated to be adverse (see Table 3-1). Actual impacts will be
strongly influenced by local environmental conditions and socio-economic circumstances, and
for each anticipated adverse health impact there is a range of social, institutional, technological,
and behavioral adaptation options to lessen that impact. Adaptations could, for example,
encompass strengthening of the public health infrastructure, health-oriented management
of the environment (including air and water quality, food safety, urban and housing design,
and surface water management), and the provision of appropriate medical care.

Unique and threatened systems: Some changes in species and systems have already been associated
with observed changes in climate, and some highly vulnerable species and systems may be at risk of
damage or even loss for very small changes in climate. Greater warming would intensify the risks
to these species and systems, and place additional ones at risk.

Extreme climate events: Increased frequencies and intensities of some extreme events have already
been observed (see Question 2) and are likely to increase with further warming, as would the risks
to human life, property, crops, livestock, and ecosystems. These risks increase where development
is occurring in inherently dynamic and unstable zones (e.g., river floodplains and low-lying coastal
regions) (see also Question 4).

Uneven distribution of impacts: In general, developing countries are at greater risk of adverse
impacts from climate change than are developed countries, of which some of the latter may
experience market sector benefits for warming less than a few °C. For greater warming, most
regions are at risk of predominantly negative effects from climate change. But developing
countries generally would continue to be more severely impacted than developed countries. Within
countries, vulnerability varies and the poorest populations often have higher exposure to impacts
that threaten their lives and livelihoods.

Global aggregate impacts: Globally aggregated market sector impacts may be positive or negative
up to a few °C, though the majority of people may be negatively affected. With greater warming,
the risk of negative global market sector impacts increases, and impacts would be predominantly
negative for most people.

Large-scale, high-impact events: The probability of large-scale, high-impact events within a 100-
year time horizon such as shutdown of the thermohaline circulation or collapse of the West Antarctic
ice sheet is very low for warming less than a few °C. The risk, which is a product of the probabilities
of these events and the magnitude of their consequences, is largely unquantified. For greater
warming, and over a time horizon longer than 100 years, the probabilities and the risks increase,
but by an amount that cannot now be estimated. See also Question 4.

© Summary statements about effects of climate change in the years 2025, 2050, and 2100 are inferred from Working Group II’s
assessment of studies that investigate the impacts of scenarios other than the SRES projections, as studies that use the SRES
projections have not been published yet. Estimates of the impacts of climate change vary by region and are highly sensitive to
estimates of regional and seasonal patterns of temperature and precipitation changes, changes in the frequencies or intensities of
climate extremes, and rates of change. Estimates of impacts are also highly sensitive to assumptions about characteristics of future
societies and the extent and effectiveness of future adaptations to climate change. In consequence, summary statements about the
impacts of climate change in the years 2025, 2050, and 2100 must necessarily be general and qualitative. The statements in the table
are considered to be valid for a broad range of scenarios. Note, however, that few studies have investigated the effects of climate
changes that would accompany global temperature increases near the upper end of the range reported for the year 2100.

Judgments of confidence use the following scale: very high (95% or greater), high (67-95%), medium (33-67%), low (5-33%), and
very low (5% or less). See WGII TAR Box 1-1.

reefs and atolls, mangroves, boreal and tropical forests, polar and alpine ecosystems, prairie
wetlands, and remnant native grasslands are examples of systems threatened by climate
change. In some cases the threatened ecosystems are those that could mitigate against
some climate change impacts (e.g., coastal systems that buffer the impacts of storms).
Possible adaptation methods to reduce the loss of biodiversity include the establishment of
refuges, parks and reserves with corridors to allow migration of species, and the use of
captive breeding and translocation of species.

The productivity of ecological systems is highly sensitive to climate change
and projections of change in productivity range from increases to decreases
(medium confidence). Increasing CO, concentrations would increase net primary
productivity (CO, fertilization) and net ecosystem productivity in most vegetation systems,
causing carbon to accumulate in vegetation and soils over time. Climate change may either
augment or reduce the direct effects of CO, on productivity, depending on the type of
vegetation, the region, and the scenario of climate change.

Models of cereal crops indicate that in some temperate areas potential yields
increase for small increases in temperature but decrease with larger temperature
changes (medium to low confidence). \n most tropical and subtropical regions
potential yields are projected to decrease for most projected increases in
temperature (medium confidence) (see Table 3-3). In mid-latitudes, crop models
indicate that warming of less than a few °C and the associated increase in CO, concentrations
will lead to generally positive responses and generally negative responses with greater
warming. In tropical agricultural areas, similar assessments indicate that yields of some
crops would decrease with even minimal increases in temperature because they are near
their maximum temperature tolerance. Where there is also a large decrease in rainfall in
subtropical and tropical dryland/rainfed systems, crop yields would be even more adversely
affected. Assessments that include autonomous agronomic adaptation (e.g., changes in
planting times and crop varieties) tend to project yields less adversely affected by climate
change than without adaptation. These assessments include the effects of CO, fertilization
but not technological innovations or changes in the impacts of pests and diseases, degradation
of soil and water resources, or climate extremes. The ability of livestock producers to
adapt their herds to the physiological stresses associated with climate change is poorly
known. Warming of a few °C or more is projected to increase food prices globally, and may
increase the risk of hunger in vulnerable populations (low confidence).

projected to reduce streamflow and groundwater recharge in many parts of the world but to

Significant portions of many highly populated coastal cities are also vulnerable to permanent
land submergence and especially to more frequent coastal flooding superimposed on surge
heights, due to sea-level rise. These estimates assume no change in the frequency or intensity of
storms, which could exacerbate the effects of sea-level rise on flooding risks in some areas.

Market Effects

The aggregated market sector effects, measured as changes in gross domestic
product (GDP), are estimated to be negative for many developing countries for
all magnitudes of global mean temperature increases studied (low confidence),
and are estimated to be mixed for developed countries for up to a few °C warming
(low confidence) and negative for warming beyond a few °C (medium to low
confidence). The effects of climate change will have market sector effects by changing
the abundance, quality, and prices of food, fiber, water, and other goods and services (see
Table 3-5). In addition, climate change can have market effects through changes in energy
demand, hydropower supply, transportation, tourism and construction, damages to property
and insurance losses from extreme climate events, loss of coastal land from sea-level rise,

temperature increases of up to a few °C, with increasing net losses for larger increases in
temperature. The estimates generally exclude the effects of changes in climate variability
and extremes, do not account for the effects of different rates of climate change, only
partially account for impacts on goods and services that are not traded in markets, and treat
gains for some as canceling out losses for others. Therefore, confidence in estimates of
market effects for individual countries is generally /ow, and the various omissions are likely
to result in underestimates of economic losses and overestimates of economic gains.

Adaptation has the potential to reduce adverse effects of climate
change and can often produce immediate ancillary benefits, but
will not prevent all damages.

Numerous possible adaptation options for responding to climate change have
been identified that can reduce adverse and enhance beneficial impacts of
climate change, but will incur costs. Quantitative evaluation of their benefits and
costs and how they vary across regions and entities is incomplete. Adaptation to climate
change can take many forms, including actions taken by people with the intent of lessening
impacts or utilizing new opportunities, and structural and functional changes in natural
systems made in response to changes in pressures. The focus in this report is on the adaptive
actions of people. The range of options includes reactive adaptations (actions taken
concurrent with changed conditions and without prior preparation) and planned adaptations
(actions taken either concurrent with or in anticipation of changed conditions, but with
prior preparation). Adaptations can be taken by private entities (e.g., individuals, households,
or business firms) or by public entities (e.g., local, state, or national government agencies).
Examples of identified options are listed in Table 3-6. The benefits and costs of adaptation
options, evaluation of which is incomplete, will also vary across regions and entities. Despite
the incomplete and evolving state of knowledge about adaptation, a number of robust
findings have been derived and summarized.

Greater and more rapid climate change would pose greater challenges for
adaptation and greater risks of damages than would lesser and slower change.
Key features of climate change to be adapted to include the magnitudes and rates of changes
in climate extremes, variability, and mean conditions. Natural and human systems have
evolved capabilities to cope with a range of climate variability within which the risks of
damage are relatively low and ability to recover is high. Changes in climate that result in
increased frequency of events that fall outside the historic range with which systems have
coped, however, increase the risk of severe damages and incomplete recovery or collapse
of the system. Changes in mean conditions (e.g., increases in average temperature), even in
the absence of changes in variance, can lead to increases in the frequencies of some events
(e.g., more frequent heat waves) that exceed the coping range, and decreases in the
frequencies of others (e.g., less frequent cold spells) (see Question 4 and Figure 4-1).

Enhancement of adaptive capacity can extend or shift ranges for coping with
variability and extremes to generate benefits in the present and future. Many
of the adaptation options listed in Table 3-6 are presently employed to cope with current
climate variability and extremes, and their expanded use can enhance both current and
future capacity to cope. But such efforts may not be as effective in the future as the amount
and rate of climate change increase.

The potential direct benefits of adaptation are substantial and take the form
of reduced adverse and enhanced beneficial impacts of climate change. Results
of studies of future impacts of climate change indicate the potential for adaptation to

example, analyses of coastal flood risks from storm surges estimate that climate change-

fold if coastal flood protection is unchanged from the present. But if coastal flood protection
is enhanced in proportion to future GDP growth, the projected increase is cut by as much
as two-thirds (see Figure 3-6). However, estimates such as these indicate only potential
benefits from adaptation, not the likely benefits—as analyses generally use arbitrary
assumptions about adaptation options and obstacles, often omit consideration of changes
in climate extremes and variability, and do not account for imperfect foresight.

Climate change is expected to negatively impact development,
sustainability, and equity.

The impacts of climate change will fall disproportionately upon developing
countries and the poor persons within all countries, and thereby exacerbate
inequities in health status and access to adequate food, clean water, and
other resources. As already noted, populations in developing countries are generally
expected to be exposed to relatively high risks of adverse impacts from climate change on
human health, water supplies, agricultural productivity, property, and other resources.
Poverty, lack of training and education, lack of infrastructure, lack of access to technologies,
lack of diversity in income opportunities, degraded natural resource base, misplaced
incentives, inadequate legal framework, and struggling public and private institutions create
conditions of low adaptive capacity in most developing countries. The exposures and low
capacity to adapt combine to make populations in developing countries generally more
vulnerable than populations in developed countries.

Non-sustainable resource use adds to the vulnerability to climate change.
Conversion of natural habitat to human uses, high harvesting rates of resources from the
environment, cultivation and grazing practices that fail to protect soils from degradation,
"	List

make systems, and the populations that derive goods, services, and livelihoods from them,
highly vulnerable to climate change. These pressures are present in developed as well as
developing countries, but satisfying development goals in ways that do not place non-
sustainable pressures on systems pose a particular dilemma for developing countries.

Hazards associated with climate change can undermine progress toward
sustainable development. More frequent and intensified droughts can exacerbate land
degradation. Increases in heavy precipitation events can increase flooding, landslides, and
mudslides, the destruction from which can set back development efforts by years in some
instances. Advances in health and nutritional status could be set back in some areas by climate
change impacts on human health and agriculture. Hazards such as these can also be exacerbated
by further development in inherently dynamic and unstable zones (e.g., floodplains, barrier
beaches, low-lying coasts, and deforested steep slopes).

Climate change can detract from the effectiveness of development projects
if not taken into account. Development projects often involve investments in infrastructure,
institutions, and human capital for the management of climate-sensitive resources such as
water, hydropower, agricultural lands, and forests. The performance of these projects can
be affected by climate change and increased climate variability, yet these factors are given
little consideration in the design of projects. Analyses have shown that flexibility to perform
well under a wider range of climate conditions can be built into projects at modest
incremental costs in some instances, and that greater flexibility has immediate value because
of risks from present climate variability.

Many of the requirements for enhancing capacity to adapt to climate change
are similar to those for promoting sustainable development. Examples of common
requirements for enhancing adaptive capacity and sustainable development include
increasing access to resources and lowering inequities in access, reducing poverty, improving
education and training, investing in infrastructure, involving concerned parties in managing
local resources, and raising institutional capacities and efficiencies. Additionally, initiatives
to slow habitat conversion, manage harvesting practices to better protect the resource, adopt
cultivation and grazing practices that protect soils, and better regulate the discharge of
pollutants can reduce vulnerabilities to climate change while moving toward more sustainable
use of resources.

This answer focuses on projected changes in the frequency and magnitude of climate fluctuations
as a result of increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols. Particular emphasis
is placed on changes in the frequency, magnitude, and duration of climatic extremes, which
represent important climate change risks for ecological systems and socio-economic sectors.
Projected abrupt or other non-linear changes in the biophysical system are discussed here;
the gradual changes in the physical, biological, and social systems are discussed in Question 3.

Models project that increasing atmospheric concentrations of
greenhouse gases will result in changes in daily, seasonal, inter-
annual, and decadal variability. There is projected to be a decrease in diurnal
temperature range in many areas, with nighttime lows increasing more than daytime highs.
A number of models show a general decrease of daily variability of surface air temperature
in winter and increased daily variability in summer in the Northern Hemisphere land areas.
Current projections show little change or a small increase in amplitude for El Nifio events
over the next 100 years. Many models show a more El Nifio-like mean response in the tropical
Pacific, with the central and eastern equatorial Pacific sea surface temperatures projected
to warm more than the western equatorial Pacific and with a corresponding mean eastward
shift of precipitation. Even with little or no change in El Nifio strength, global warming is
likely to lead to greater extremes of drying and heavy rainfall and increase the risk of droughts
and floods that occur with El Nifio events in many different regions. There is no clear agreement
between models concerning the changes in frequency or structure of other naturally occurring
atmosphere-ocean circulation pattern such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).

The duration, location, frequency, and intensity of extreme weather
and climate events are likely to very likely to change, and would
result in mostly adverse impacts on biophysical systems.

Natural circulation patterns, such as ENSO and NAO, play a fundamental role in global
climate and its short-term (daily, intra- and inter-annual) and longer term (decadal to multi-
decadal) variability. Climate change may manifest itself as a shift in means as well as a
change in preference of specific climate circulation patterns that could result in changes in
the variance and frequency of extremes of climatic variables (see Figure 4-1).

More hot days and heat waves and fewer cold and frost days are very likely
over nearly all land areas. Increases in mean temperature will lead to increases in hot
weather and record hot weather, with fewer frost days and cold waves (see Figure 4-1a,b).
A number of models show a generally decreased daily variability of surface air temperature
in winter and increased daily variability in summer in Northern Hemisphere land areas.
The changes in temperature extremes are likely to result in increased crop and livestock
losses, higher energy use for cooling and lower for heating, and increased human morbidity
and heat-stress-related mortality (see Table 4-1). Fewer frost days will result in decreased
cold-related human morbidity and mortality, and decreased risk of damage to a number of
crops, though the risk to other crops may increase. Benefits to agriculture from a small
temperature increase could result in small increases in the GDP of temperate zone countries.

The amplitude and frequency of extreme precipitation events is very likely to
increase over many areas and the return period for extreme precipitation events are
projected to decrease. This would lead to more frequent floods and landslides with attendant
loss of life, health impacts (e.g., epidemics, infectious diseases, food poisoning), property
damage, loss to infrastructure and settlements, soil erosion, pollution loads, insurance and
agriculture losses, amongst others. A general drying of the mid-continental areas during
summer is likely to lead to increases in summer droughts and could increase the risk of
wild fires. This general drying is due to a combination of increased temperature and potential
evaporation that is not balanced by increases in precipitation. It is likely that global warming
will lead to an increase in the variability of Asian summer monsoon precipitation.

High resolution modeling studies suggest that over some areas the peak wind
intensity of tropical cyclones is likely to increase by 5 to 10% and precipitation
rates may increase by 20 to 30%, but none of the studies suggest that the locations of the
tropical cyclones will change. There is little consistent modeling evidence for changes in
the frequency of tropical cyclones.

There is insufficient information on how very small-scale phenomena may
change. Very small-scale phenomena such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, hail, hailstorms,
and lightning are not simulated in global climate models.

The climate system involves many processes that interact in complex non-linear ways, which
can give rise to thresholds (thus potentially abrupt changes) in the climate system that
could be crossed if the system were perturbed sufficiently. These abrupt and other non-linear
changes include large climate-induced increase in greenhouse gas emissions from terrestrial
ecosystems, a collapse of the thermohaline circulation (THC; see Figure 4-2), and disintegration
of the Antarctic and the Greenland ice sheets. Some of these changes have low probability
of occurrence during the 21st century; however, greenhouse gas forcing in the 21st century
could set in motion changes that could lead to such transitions in subsequent centuries (see
Question 5). Some of these changes (e.g., to THC) could be irreversible over centuries to
millennia. There is a large degree of uncertainty about the mechanisms involved and about
the likelihood or time scales of such changes; however, there is evidence from polar ice
cores of atmospheric regimes changing within a few years and large-scale hemispheric changes
as fast as a few decades with large consequences on the biophysical systems.

flowing currents in the North Atlantic warm northwestern Europe by up to 10°C). Model simulations indicate that the North Atlantic branch of
this circulation system is particularly vulnerable to changes in atmospheric temperature and in the hydrological cycle. Such perturbations caused

Large, rapid increases in atmospheric CH, either from reductions in the

of tropospheric pollutants does not occur within the range of SRES scenarios. The CH,
reservoir buried in solid hydrate deposits under permafrost and ocean sediments is enormous,
more than 1,000-fold the current atmospheric content. A proposed climate feedback occurs
when the hydrates decompose in response to warming and release large amounts of CH,;
however, most of the CH, gas released from the solid form is decomposed by bacteria in
the sediments and water column, thus limiting the amount emitted to the atmosphere unless
explosive ebullient emissions occur. The feedback has not been quantified, but there are no

"4.13 Most models project a weakening of the ocean thermohaline circulation, which
leads to a reduction of the heat transport into high latitudes of Europe (see
Figure 4-2). However, even in models where THC weakens, there is still a warming over
Europe due to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases. The current projections do
not exhibit a complete shutdown of THC by the year 2100. Beyond the year 2100, some
models suggest that THC could completely, and possibly irreversibly, shut down in either
hemisphere if the change in radiative forcing is large enough and applied long enough.
Models indicate that a decrease in THC reduces its resilience to perturbations (i.e., a once-
reduced THC appears to be less stable and a shutdown can become more likely).

4.14 The Antarctic ice sheet as a whole is likely to increase in mass during the
21st century. However, the West Antarctic ice sheet could lose mass over the
next 1,000 years with an associated sea-level rise of several meters, but there
is an incomplete understanding of some of the underlying processes. Concerns
have been expressed about the stability of the West Antarctic ice sheet because it is grounded
below sea level. However, loss of grounded ice leading to substantial sea-level rise from
this source is widely agreed to be very unlikely during the 21st century. Current climate
and ice dynamic models project that over the next 100 years the Antarctic ice sheet as a
whole is likely to gain mass because of a projected increase in precipitation, contributing
to a relative decrease of several centimeters to sea level. Over the next 1,000 years, these
models project that the West Antarctic ice sheet could contribute up to 3 m to sea-level rise.

4.15 The Greenland ice sheet is likely to lose mass during the 21st century and |
contribute a few centimeters to sea-level rise. Over the 21st century, the Greenland
ice sheet is likely to lose mass because the projected increase in runoff will exceed the
increase in precipitation and contribute 10 cm maximum to the total sea-level rise. The ice
sheets will continue to react to climate warming and contribute to sea-level rise for thousands
of years after climate has stabilized. Climate models indicate that the local warming over
Greenland is likely to be one to three times the global average. Ice sheet models project
that a local warming of larger than 3°C, if sustained for thousands of years, would lead to
virtually a complete melting of the Greenland ice sheet with a resulting sea-level rise of
about 7 m. A local warming of 5.5°C, if sustained for 1,000 years, would likely result in a
contribution from Greenland of about 3 m to sea-level rise (see Question 3).

4.16 Pronounced changes in permafrost temperature, surface morphology, and
distribution are expected in the 21st century. Permafrost currently underlies 24.5%
of the exposed land area of the Northern Hemisphere. Under climatic warming, much of
this terrain would be vulnerable to subsidence, particularly in areas of relatively warm,
discontinuous permafrost. The area of the Northern Hemisphere occupied by permafrost
could eventually be reduced by 12 to 22% of its current extent and could eventually disappear
from half the present-day Canadian permafrost region. The changes on the southern limit
may become obvious by the late 21st century, but some thick ice-rich permafrost could
persist in relict form for centuries or millennia. Thawing of ice-rich permafrost can be
accompanied by mass movements and subsidence of the surface, possibly increasing the
sediment loads in water courses and causing damage to the infrastructure in developed
regions. Depending on the precipitation regime and drainage conditions, degradation of
permafrost could lead to emission of greenhouse gases, conversion of forest to bogs,
grasslands, or wetland ecosystems and could cause major erosion problems and landslides.

4.17 Many natural and managed ecosystems may change abruptly
or non-linearly during the 21st century. The greater the magnitude
and rate of the change, the greater the risk of adverse impacts.

or in combination with any of several stresses (e.g., excessive pollution and siltation), can

eventual death of the corals, and a possible loss of biodiversity. Climate change will also
shift suitable habitats for many terrestrial and marine organisms polewards or terrestrial
ones to higher altitudes in mountainous areas. Increased disturbances along with the shift
in habitats and the more restrictive conditions needed for establishment of species could
lead to abrupt and rapid breakdown of terrestrial and marine ecosystems, which could

key development stages of some crops and result in severe losses in crop yields. Examples

Large-scale changes in vegetation cover could affect regional climate. Changes
in land surface characteristics, such as those created by land cover, can modify energy,
water, and gas fluxes and affect atmospheric composition creating changes in local/regional
climate and thus changing the disturbance regime (e.g., in the Arctic). In areas without
surface water (typically semi-arid or arid), evapotranspiration and albedo affect the local
hydrologic cycle, thus a reduction in vegetative cover could lead to reduced precipitation
at the local/regional scale and change the frequency and persistence of droughts.

Inertia is a widespread inherent characteristic of the interacting

* Stabilization of atmospheric CO, concentrations at 450, 650, or 1,000 ppm would require
global anthropogenic CO, emissions to drop below the year 1990 level, within a few
decades, about a century, ‘or about 2 centuries, respectively, and continue to decrease
steadily thereafter (see Figure 6-1).

These time constraints are partly due to the rate of CO, uptake by the ocean, which is limited
by the slow transport of carbon between the surface and deep waters. There is sufficient
uptake capacity in the ocean to incorporate 70 to 80% of foreseeable anthropogenic CO, emissions
to the atmosphere, but this would take several centuries. Chemical reaction involving ocean
sediments has the potential to remove up to a further 15% over a period of 5,000 years.

A delay between biospheric carbon uptake and carbon release is manifest
as a temporary net carbon uptake. The main flows in the global carbon cycle have
widely differing characteristic time scales (see Figures 5-1 and 5-4). The net terrestrial
carbon uptake that has developed over the past few decades is partly a result of the time lag
between photosynthetic carbon uptake and carbon release when plants eventually die and decay.
For example, the uptake resulting from regrowth of forests on agricultural lands, abandoned
over the last century in the Northern Hemisphere, will decline as the forests reach their mature
biomass, growth slows, and death increases. Enhancement of plant carbon uptake due to elevated
CO, or nitrogen deposition will eventually saturate, then decomposition of the increased
biomass will catch up. Climate change is likely to increase disturbance and decomposition
rates in the future. Some models project that the recent global net terrestrial carbon uptake
will peak, then level off or decrease. The peak could be passed within the 21st century
according to several model projections. Projections of the global net terrestrial carbon
exchange with the atmosphere beyond a few decades remain uncertain (see Figure 5-5).

Although warming reduces the uptake of CO, by the ocean, the oceanic net carbon uptake
is projected to persist under rising atmospheric CO,, at least for the 21st century. Movement
of carbon from the surface to the deep ocean takes centuries, and its equilibration there
with ocean sediments takes millennia.

When subjected to rapid climate change, ecological systems are likely to be
disrupted as a consequence of the differences in response times within the
system. The resulting loss of capacity by the ecosystem to supply services such as food,
timber, and biodiversity maintenance on a sustainable basis may not be immediately apparent.
Climate change may lead to conditions unsuitable for the establishment of key species, but
the slow and delayed response of long-lived plants hides the importance of the change until
the already established individuals die or are killed in a disturbance. For example, for
climate change of the degree possible within the 21st century, it is likely, in some forests,
that when a stand is disturbed by fire, wind, pests, or harvesting, instead of the community
regenerating as in the past, species may be lost or replaced by different species.

Humans have shown a capacity to adapt to long-term mean climate conditions,

but there is less success in adapting to extremes and to year-to-year variations
in climatic conditions. Climatic changes in the next 100 years are expected to exceed

economic adaptation varies from years to decades, depending on the sector and the resources
available to assist the transition. There is inertia in decision making in the area of adaptation
and mitigation, and in implementing those decisions, on the order of decades. The fact that
adaptation and mitigation decisions are generally not made by the same entities compounds
the difficulties inherent in the identification and implementation of the best possible
combination of strategies, and hence contributes to the delays of climate change response.

There is typically a delay of years to decades between perceiving a need to
respond to a major challenge, planning, researching and developing a solution,
and implementing it. This delay can be shortened by anticipating needs through the application
of foresight, and thus developing technologies in advance. The response of technological
development to energy price changes has historically been relatively rapid (typically, less
than 5 years elapses between a price shock and the response in terms of patenting activity
and introduction of new model offerings) but its diffusion takes much longer. The diffusion
rate often depends on the rate of retirement of previously installed equipment. Early
deployment of rapidly improving technologies allows learning-curve cost reductions
(learning by doing), without premature lock-in to existing, low-efficiency technology. The
rate of technology diffusion is strongly dependent not only on economic feasibility but also
on socio-economic pressures. For some technologies, such as the adoption of new crop
varieties, the availability of, and information on, pre-existing adaptation options allows for
rapid adaptation. In many regions, however, population pressures on limited land and water
resources, government policies impeding change, or limited access to information or
financial resources make adaptation difficult and slow. Optimal adaptation to climate change
trends, such as more frequent droughts, may be delayed if they are perceived to be due to
natural variability, while they might actually be related to climate change. Conversely,
maladaptation can occur if climate variability is mistaken for a trend.

Social structures and personal values interact with society’s physical infrastructure,
institutions, and the technologies embodied within them, and the combined

"innovations comes up against people’s traditional preferences and other social and cultural
barriers. Unless advantages are very clear, social or behavioral changes on the part of technology
users may require decades. Energy use and greenhouse gas mitigation are peripheral interests
in most people’s everyday lives. Their consumption patterns are driven not only by demographic,
economic and technological change, resource availability, infrastructure, and time constraints,
but also by motivation, habit, need, compulsion, social structures, and other factors.

5.12 Social and economic time scales are not fixed: They are sensitive to social
and economic forces, and could be changed by policies and the choices
made by individuals. Behavioral and technological changes can occur rapidly under
severe economic conditions. For example, the oil crises of the 1970s triggered societal
interest in energy conservation and alternative sources of energy, and the economy in most
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries deviated
strongly from the traditional tie between energy consumption and economic development
growth rates (see Figure 5-6). Another example is the observed reduction in CO, emissions
caused by the disruption of the economy of the Former Soviet Union (FSU) countries in
1988. The response in both cases was very rapid (within a few years). The converse is also
apparently true: In situations where pressure to change is small, inertia is large. This has
implicitly been assumed to be the case in the SRES scenarios, since they do not consider
major stresses, such as economic recession, large-scale conflict, or collapses in food stocks
and associated human suffering, which are inherently difficult to forecast.

5.13 Stabilization of atmospheric CO, concentration at levels below about 600 ppm
is only possible with reductions in carbon intensity and/or energy intensity
greater than have been achieved historically. This implies shifts toward alternative
development pathways with new social, institutional, and technological configurations that
address environmental constraints. Low historical rates of improvement in energy intensity
(energy use per unit GDP) reflect the relatively low priority placed on energy efficiency by
most producers and users of technology. By contrast, labor productivity increased at higher
rates over the period 1980 to 1992. The historically recorded annual rates of improvement
of global energy intensity (1 to 1.5% per year) would have to be increased and maintained
over long time frames to achieve stabilization of CO, concentrations at about 600 ppm or
below (see Figure 5-7). Carbon intensity (carbon per unit energy produced) reduction rates
would eventually have to change by even more (e.g., up to 1.5% per year (the historical
baseline is 0.3 to 0.4% per year)). In reality, both energy intensity and carbon intensity are
likely to continue to improve, but greenhouse gas stabilization at levels below 600 ppm
requires that at least one of them do so at a rate much higher than historically achieved. The
lower the stabilization target and the higher the level of baseline emissions, the larger the
CO, divergence from the baseline that is needed, and the earlier it would need to occur.

5.14. Some climate, ecological, and socio-economic system changes
are effectively irreversible over many human lifetimes, and
others are intrinsically irreversible.

5.15 There are two types of apparent irreversibility. “Effective irreversibility” derives
from processes that have the potential to return to their pre-disturbance state, but take
centuries to millennia to do so. An example is the partial melting of the Greenland ice
sheet. Another is the projected rise in mean sea level, partly as a result of melting of the
cryosphere, but primarily due to thermal expansion of the oceans. The world is already
committed to some sea-level rise as a consequence of the surface atmospheric warming
that has occurred over the past century. “Intrinsic irreversibility” results from crossing a
threshold beyond which the system no longer spontaneously returns to the previous state.
An example of an intrinsically irreversible change due to crossing a threshold is the extinction
of species, resulting from a combination of climate change and habitat loss.

The location of a threshold, and the resistance to change in its vicinity, can be
affected by the rate at which the threshold is approached. Model results indicate
that a threshold may exist in the ocean thermohaline circulation (see Question 4) such that
a transition to a new ocean circulation, as occurred during the emergence from the last
glacial period, could be induced if the world warms rapidly. While such a transition is very
unlikely during the 21st century, some models suggest that it would be irreversible (i.e., the
new circulation would persist even after the perturbation disappeared). For slower rates of
warming, THC would likely gradually adjust and thresholds may not be crossed. This
implies that the greenhouse gas emission trajectory is important in determining the evolution
of THC. When a system approaches a threshold, as is the case for a weakening THC under
global warming, resilience to perturbations decreases.

Higher rates of warming and the compounded effects of multiple stresses
increase the likelihood of a threshold crossing. An example of an ecological
threshold is provided by the migration of plant species as they respond to a changing
climate. Fossil records indicate that the maximum rate at which most plant species have
migrated in the past is about 1 km per year. Known constraints imposed by the dispersal
process (e.g., the mean period between germination and the production of seeds, and the
mean distance that an individual seed can travel) suggest that, without human intervention,
many species would not be able to keep up with the rate of movement of their preferred
climatic niche projected for the 21st century, even if there were no barriers to their movement
imposed by land use. An example of a socio-economic threshold is provided by conflicts in
already stressed situations—for example, a river basin shared by several nations with
competition for a limited water resource. Further pressure from an environmental stress

such as reduced stream flow could trigger more severe conflict. If impacted systems are
not fully understood, the presence of a threshold may not be apparent until it is reached.

Inertia in the climate, ecological, and socio-economic systems
makes adaptation inevitable and already necessary in some
cases, and inertia affects the optimal mix of adaptation and
mitigation strategies.

As a result of the time lags and inertias inherent in the Earth system, including
its social components, some of the consequences of actions taken, or not
taken, will only be felt many years in the future. For example, the differences in the
initial trajectories of the various SRES and stabilization scenarios are small, but the outcomes
in terms of the climate in the year 2100 are large. The choice of development path has
consequences at all the affected time scales; thus, long-term total costs and benefits may
differ considerably from short-term ones.

In the presence of inertia, well-founded actions to adapt to or mitigate climate
change are more effective, and under some circumstances may be cheaper,
if taken earlier rather than later. Time lags provide a breathing space between emissions
and impacts, thus allowing time for planned adaptation. The inertia of technology
development and capital stock replacement is an important argument for gradual mitigation.
The essential point of inertia in economic structures and processes is that deviation from any
given trend incurs costs, and these costs rise with the speed of deviations (e.g., the costs of
early retirement of carbon-intensive facilities). Earlier mitigation action may reduce the
risk of incurring severe lasting or irreversible impacts, while reducing the need for more
rapid mitigation later. Accelerated action may help to drive down the costs of mitigation and

of inertia and uncertainty, resulting in a sequential decision-making process. Foresight and

as dams and bridges, and large social inertia, such as misallocated property rights.

as dams and bridges, and large social inertia, such as misallocated property rights.
Anticipatory adaptive action can be very cost-effective if the anticipated trend materializes.

The existence of time lags, inertia, and irreversibility in the Earth system
means that a mitigation action or technology development can have different
outcomes, depending on when it is taken. For example, in one model analysis of
the hypothetical effect of reducing anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions to zero in the
year 1995, on sea-level rise during the 21st century in the Pacific, showed that the sea-level
rise that would inevitably occur due to warming incurred to 1995 (5 to 12 cm) would be
substantially less than if the same emission reduction occurred in the year 2020 (14 to 32
cm). This demonstrates the increasing commitment to future sea-level rise due to past and
present emissions, and the effect of delaying the hypothetical emissions reduction.

Technological inertia in less developed countries can be reduced through
“leapfrogging” (i.e., adopting anticipative strategies to avoid the problems
faced today by industrial societies). It cannot be assumed that developing countries
will automatically follow the past development paths of industrialized countries. For
example, some developing countries have bypassed land-lines for communication, and
proceeded directly to mobile phones. Developing countries could avoid the past energy-
inefficient practices of developed countries by adopting technologies that use energy ina
more sustainable way, recycling more wastes and products, and handling residual wastes in
amore acceptable manner. This may be easier to achieve in new infrastructure and energy
systems in developing countries since large investments are needed in any case. Transfer
of technology between countries and regions can reduce technological inertia.

Inertia and uncertainty in the climate, ecological, and socio-economic systems
imply that safety margins should be considered in setting strategies, targets,
and time tables for avoiding dangerous levels of interference in the climate
system. Stabilization target levels of, for instance, atmospheric CO, concentration,
temperature, or sea level may be affected by:
¢ The inertia of the climate system, which will cause climate change to continue for a
period after mitigation actions are implemented
¢ Uncertainty regarding the location of possible thresholds of irreversible change and the
behavior of the system in their vicinity
¢ The time lags between adoption of mitigation goals and their achievement.
Similarly, adaptation is affected by time lags involved in identifying climate change impacts,
developing effective adaptation strategies, and implementing adaptive measures. Hedging
strategies and sequential decision making (iterative action, assessment, and revised action)
may be appropriate responses to the combination of inertia and uncertainty. Inertia has
different consequences for adaptation than for mitigation. with adaptation being primarily

The climatic, environmental, and socio-economic consequences of greenhouse gas emissions
were assessed in Question 3 for scenarios that do not include any climate policy interventions.
These same issues are addressed here in Question 6, but this time to assess the benefits that
would result from a set of climate policy interventions. Among the emission reduction
scenarios considered are scenarios that would achieve stabilization of CO, concentrations
in the atmosphere. The role of adaptation as a complement to mitigation and the potential
contributions of reducing emissions to the goals of sustainable development and equity are
evaluated. The policies and technologies that might be used to implement the emission
reductions and their costs are considered in Question 7.

The projected rate and magnitude of warming and sea-level rise
can be lessened by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The greater the reductions in emissions and the earlier they are introduced,
the smaller and slower the projected warming and rise in sea levels. Future
climate change is determined by historic, current, and future emissions. Estimates have
been made of the global mean temperature and sea-level rise effects of a 2% per year
reduction in CO, emissions by developed countries over the period 2000 to 2100, assuming
that developing countries do not reduce their emissions.° Under these assumptions, global
emissions and the atmospheric concentration of CO, grow throughout the century but at a
diminished rate compared to scenarios that assume no actions to reduce developed country
emissions. The effects of the emission limit accrue slowly but build with time. By the year
2030, the projected concentration of CO, in the atmosphere is reduced roughly 20% relative
to the IS92a scenario of unabated emissions, which diminishes warming and sea-level rise
by asmall amount within this time frame. By the year 2100, the projected CO, concentration
is reduced by 35% relative to the IS92a scenario, projected global mean warming reduced
by 25%, and projected sea-level rise reduced by 20%. Analyses of CO, emission reductions
of 1% per year by developed countries indicate that the lesser reductions would yield
smaller reductions in CO, concentration, temperature change, and sea-level rise. Actions
such as these taken now would have a greater effect at the year 2100 than the same emissions
reductions implemented at a later time.

Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and the gases that control their
concentration would be necessary to stabilize radiative forcing. For example,
for the most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas, carbon cycle models indicate that
stabilization of atmospheric CO, concentrations at 450, 650, or 1,000 ppm would require
global anthropogenic CO, emissions to drop below year 1990 levels within a few decades,
about a century, or about 2 centuries, respectively, and continue to decrease steadily thereafter
(see Figure 6-1). These models illustrate that emissions would peak in about 1 to 2 decades
(450 ppm) and roughly a century (1,000 ppm) from the present (see Table 6-1). Eventually
CO, emissions would need to decline to a very small fraction of current emissions. The
benefits of different stabilization levels are discussed later in Question 6 and the costs of
these stabilization levels are discussed in Question 7.

There is a wide band of uncertainty in the amount of warming that would result
from any stabilized greenhouse gas concentration. Estimates of global mean
temperature change for scenarios that would stabilize the concentration of CO, at different
levels, and hold them constant thereafter, are presented in Figure 6-1c. The uncertainty about
climate sensitivity yields a wide range of estimates of temperature change that would result

carbon cycle models. Also shown for comparison are CO, emissions for three of the SRES scenarios (A1B, A2, and B1), which do not

emissions (A1B, A2, and B1).

Global mean temperature changes: Global mean temperature changes are estimated for the WRE stabilization profiles using a simple
climate model tuned in turn to each of several more complex models. Estimated warming slows as growth in the atmospheric concentration
of CO, slows and warming continues after the time at which the CO, concentration is stabilized (indicated by black spots) but ata much
diminished rate. It is assumed that emissions of gases other than CO, follow the SRES A1B projection until the year 2100 and are constant
thereafter. This scenario was chosen as it is in the middle of the range of the SRES scenarios. The dashed lines show the temperature
changes projected for the S profiles, an alternate set of CO, stabilization profiles (not shown in panels (a) or (b)). The shaded area

from emissions corresponding to a selected concentration level.’ This is shown more clearly
in Figure 6-2, which shows eventual CO, concentration stabilization levels and the corresponding
range of temperature change that is estimated to be realized in the year 2100 and at long-run
equilibrium. To estimate temperature changes for these scenarios, it is assumed that emissions
of greenhouse gases other than CO, would follow the SRES A1B scenario until the year
2100 and that emissions of these gases would be constant thereafter. Different assumptions
about emissions of other greenhouse gases would result in different estimates of warming
for each CO, stabilization level.

Emission reductions that would eventually stabilize the atmospheric concentration
of CO, at a level below 1,000 ppm, based on profiles shown in Figure 6-1, and
assuming that emissions of gases other than CO, follow the SRES A1B
projection until the year 2100 and are constant thereafter, are estimated to
limit global mean temperature increase to 3.5°C or less through the year 2100.
Global average surface temperature is estimated to increase 1.2 to 3.5°C by the year 2100
for profiles that would limit CO, emissions so as to eventually stabilize the concentration
of CO, at a level from 450 to 1,000 ppm. Thus, although all of the CO, concentration
stabilization profiles analyzed would prevent, during the 21st century, much of the upper
end of the SRES projections of warming (1.4 to 5.8°C by the year 2100), it should be noted
that for most of the profiles the concentration of CO, would continue to rise beyond the
year 2100. Owing to the large inertia of the ocean (see Question 5), temperatures are
projected to continue to rise even after stabilization of CO, and other greenhouse gas
concentrations, though at a rate that is slower than is projected for the period prior to
stabilization and that diminishes with time. The equilibrium temperature rise would take
many centuries to reach, and ranges from 1.5 to 3.9°C above the year 1990 levels for

stabilization at 450 ppm and 3.5 to 8.7°C above the year 1990 levels for stabilization at
1,000 ppm.* Furthermore, for a specific temperature stabilization target, there is a very
wide range of uncertainty associated with the required stabilization level of greenhouse
gas concentration (see Figure 6-2). The level at which CO, concentration is required to be
stabilized for a given temperature target also depends on the levels of the non-CO, gases.
Results from the only comprehensive climate model that has been used to analyze the

referred to as the S and WRE profiles.'!° The WRE profiles allow higher emissions in early
decades than do the S profiles, but then must require lower emissions in later decades to
achieve a specified stabilization level. This deferment of emission reductions in the WRE
profiles is estimated to reduce mitigation costs (see Question 7) but would result in a more
rapid rate of warming initially. The difference in temperature projections for the two sets of
pathways is 0.2°C or less in the year 2050, when the difference is most pronounced. Beyond
the year 2100, the temperature changes of the WRE and S profiles converge. The temperature
projections for the S and WRE profiles are compared in Figure 6-1c.

Sea level and ice sheets would continue to respond to warming for many centuries
after greenhouse gas concentrations have been stabilized (see Question 5).
The projected range of sea-level rise due to thermal expansion at equilibrium is 0.5 to 2m
for an increase in CO, concentration from the pre-industrial level of 280 to 560 ppm and 1
to 4 m for an increase in CO, concentration from 280 to 1,120 ppm. The observed rise over
the 20th century was 0.1 to 0.2m. The projected rise would be larger if the effect of increases
in other greenhouse gas concentrations were to be taken into account. There are other contributions
to sea-level rise over time scales of centuries to millennia (see Question 5). Models assessed
in the TAR project sea-level rise of several meters from polar ice sheets (see Question 4)
and land ice even for stabilization levels of 550 ppm CO,-equivalent.

Reducing emissions of greenhouse gases to stabilize their
atmospheric concentrations would delay and reduce damages
caused by climate change.

Greenhouse gas emission reduction (mitigation) actions would lessen the
pressures on natural and human systems from climate change. Slower rates of
increase in global mean temperature and sea level would allow more time for adaptation.
Consequently, mitigation actions are expected to delay and reduce damages caused by
climate change and thereby generate environmental and socio-economic benefits. Mitigation
actions and their associated costs are assessed in the response to Question 7.

Mitigation actions to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse
gases at lower levels would generate greater benefits in terms of less damage.
Stabilization at lower levels reduces the risk of exceeding temperature thresholds in
biophysical systems where these exist. Stabilization of CO, at, for example, 450 ppm is
estimated to yield an increase in global mean temperature in the year 2100 that is about
0.75 to 1.25°C less than is estimated for stabilization at 1,000 ppm (see Figure 6-2). At
equilibrium the difference is about 2 to 5°C. The geographical extent of the damage to or
loss of natural systems, and the number of systems affected, which increase with the
magnitude and rate of climate change, would be lower for a lower stabilization level.
Similarly, for a lower stabilization level the severity of impacts from climate extremes is
expected to be less, fewer regions would suffer adverse net market sector impacts, global
aggregate impacts would be smaller, and risks of large-scale high-impact events would be
reduced. Figure 6-3 presents a summary of climate change risks or reasons for concern
(see Box 3-2) juxtaposed against the ranges of global mean temperature change in the year
2100 that have been estimated for different scenarios.""

Comprehensive, quantitative estimates of the benefits of stabilization at various
levels of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases do not yet exist.

OF 1uture Cililmate Chahee, Wie liiipacts Wat would result UNGer Aurerent sCcenarlos are
incompletely quantified. Because of uncertainty in climate sensitivity, and uncertainty about
the geographic and seasonal patterns of changes in temperatures, precipitation, and other
climate variables and phenomena, the impacts of climate change cannot be uniquely
determined for individual emission scenarios. There are also uncertainties about key
processes and sensitivities and adaptive capacities of systems to changes in climate. In
addition, impacts such as changes in the composition and function of ecological systems,
species extinction, and changes in human health, and disparity in the distribution of impacts
across different populations and regions, are not readily expressed in monetary or other
common units. Because of these limitations, the benefits of different greenhouse gas
reduction actions, including actions to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations at selected
levels, are incompletely characterized and cannot be compared directly to mitigation costs
for the purpose of estimating the net economic effects of mitigation.

Adaptation is a necessary strategy at all scales to complement
climate change mitigation efforts. Together they can contribute
to sustainable development objectives.

Adaptation can complement mitigation in a cost-effective strategy to reduce
climate change risks. Reductions of greenhouse gas emissions, even stabilization of
their concentrations in the atmosphere at a low level, will neither altogether prevent climate
change or sea-level rise nor altogether prevent their impacts. Many reactive adaptations
will occur in response to the changing climate and rising seas and some have already occurred.
In addition, the development of planned adaptation strategies to address risks and utilize
opportunities can complement mitigation actions to lessen climate change impacts. However,
adaptation would entail costs and cannot prevent all damages. Adaptation implemented in
combination with mitigation can be a more cost-effective approach to reducing the impacts
of climate change than either applied alone. The potential for adaptation to substantially
reduce many of the adverse impacts of climate change was assessed in Question 3. Because
there are overlapping ranges of global temperature increases associated with the various
stabilization levels (see Figure 6-1c), many adaptation options will be appropriate for a
range of stabilization levels. Improved knowledge will narrow the uncertainties associated
with particular stabilization levels and identification of appropriate adaptation strategies.

Adaptation costs and challenges can be lessened by mitigation of climate
change. Greenhouse gas emission reductions would reduce the magnitude and rate of
changes to be adapted to, possibly including changes in the frequencies and intensities of
extreme events. The smaller changes to which systems would be exposed, and slower pace
at which stresses would increase, would allow more time for adaptation and lessen the
degree to which current practices for coping with climate variability and extremes might
need to be modified (see Question 3). More aggressive mitigation efforts will therefore
reduce adaptation costs to attain a specified level of effectiveness.

Mitigation and adaptation actions can, if appropriately designed, advance
sustainable development objectives. As described in Question 3, risks associated
with climate change have the potential to undermine progress toward sustainable development
(e.g., damages from extreme climate events, water shortage and degraded water quality,
food supply disruptions and hunger, land degradation, and diminished human health). By
reducing these risks, climate change mitigation and adaptation policies can improve the
prospects for sustainable development.’

The impact of climate change is projected to have different effects within
and between countries. The challenge of addressing climate change raises
an important issue of equity. Climate change pressures can exacerbate inequities
between developing and developed countries; lessening these pressures through mitigation
and enhancement of adaptive capacity can reduce these inequities. People in developing
countries, particularly the poorest people in these countries, are considered to be more
vulnerable to climate change than people in developed countries (see Question 3). Reducing
the rate of warming and sea-level rise and increasing the capacity to adapt to climate change
would benefit all countries, particularly developing countries.

Reducing and slowing climate change can also promote inter-generational
equity. Emissions of the present generation will affect many future generations because of
inertia in the atmosphere-ocean-climate system and the long-lived and sometimes irreversible
effects of climate change on the environment. Future generations are generally anticipated
to be wealthier, better educated and informed, and technologically more advanced than the
present generation and consequently better able to adapt in many respects. But the changes
set in motion in coming decades will accumulate and some could reach magnitudes that
would severely test the abilities of many societies to cope. For irreversible impacts, such as
the extinction of species or loss of unique ecosystems, there are no adaptation responses
that can fully remedy the losses. Mitigating climate change would lessen the risks to future
generations from the actions of the present generation.

up from assessments of specific technologies and sectors; and top-down approaches, which

Potential, Barriers, Opportunities, Policies, and Costs of Reducing
Greenhouse Gas Emissions in the Near Term

Significant technological and biological potential exists for near-
term mitigation.

Significant technical progress relevant to greenhouse gas emissions reduction
has been made since the SAR, and has been faster than anticipated. Advances
are taking place in a wide range of technologies at different stages of development—for
example, the market introduction of wind turbines; the rapid elimination of industrial by-product
gases, such as N,O from adipic acid production and perfluorocarbons from aluminum production;
efficient hybrid engine cars; the advancement of fuel cell technology; and the demonstration
of underground CO, storage. Technological options for emissions reduction include improved
efficiency of end-use devices and energy conversion technologies, shift to zero- and low-carbon
energy technologies, improved energy management, reduction of industrial by-product and
process gas emissions, and carbon removal and storage. Table 7-1 summarizes the results
from many sectoral studies, largely at the project, national, and regional level with some at
the global level, providing estimates of potential greenhouse gas emissions reductions to
the 2010 and 2020 time frame.

Forests, agricultural lands, and other terrestrial ecosystems offer significant
carbon mitigation potential. Conservation and sequestration of carbon, although
not necessarily permanent, may allow time for other options to be further
developed and implemented (see Table 7-2). Biological mitigation can occur by three
strategies: a) conservation of existing carbon pools, b) sequestration by increasing the size
of carbon pools,'? and c) substitution of sustainably produced biological products (e.g.,
wood for energy-intensive construction products and biomass for fossil fuels). Conservation
of threatened carbon pools may help to avoid emissions, if leakage can be prevented, and
can only become sustainable if the socio-economic drivers for deforestation and other
losses of carbon pools can be addressed. Sequestration reflects the biological dynamics of
growth, often starting slowly, passing through a maximum, and then declining over decades
to centuries. The potential of biological mitigation options is on the order of 100 Gt C
(cumulative) by the year 2050, equivalent to about 10 to 20% of projected fossil-fuel
emissions during that period, although there are substantial uncertainties associated with

The successful implementation of greenhouse gas mitigation options
would need to overcome technical, economic, political, cultural, social,
behavioral, and/or institutional barriers that prevent the full exploitation of
the technological, economic, and social opportunities of these mitigation
options (see Figure 7-1). The potential mitigation opportunities and types of barriers
vary by region and sector, and over time. Most countries could benefit from innovative
financing, social learning and innovation, and institutional reforms, removing barriers to
trade, and poverty eradication. This is caused by a wide variation in mitigation capacity.
The poor in any country are faced with limited opportunities to adopt technologies or
change their social behavior, particularly if they are not part of a cash economy. Most
countries could benefit from innovative financing and institutional reform and removing
barriers to trade. In the industrialized countries, future opportunities lie primarily in removing
social and behavioral barriers; in countries with economies in transition, in price
rationalization; and in developing countries, in price rationalization, increased access to
data and information, availability of advanced technologies, financial resources, and training
and capacity building. Opportunities for any given country, however, might be found in the
removal of any combination of barriers.

National responses to climate change can be more effective if deployed as a
portfolio of policy instruments to limit or reduce net greenhouse gas emissions.
The portfolio of national climate policy instruments may include—according to national
circumstances—emissions/carbon/energy taxes, tradable or non-tradable permits, provision
and/or removal of subsidies, land-use policies, deposit/refund systems, technology or
performance standards, energy mix requirements, product bans, voluntary agreements,
information campaigns, environmental labeling, government spending and investment, and
support for research and development (R&D). The literature in general gives no preference
for any particular policy instrument.

Coordinated actions among countries and sectors may help to reduce
mitigation cost by addressing competitiveness concerns, potential conflicts
with international trade rules, and carbon leakage. A group of countries that
wants to limit its collective greenhouse gas emissions could agree to implement
well-designed international instruments. Instruments assessed in the WGIII TAR,
and being developed in the Kyoto Protocol, are emissions trading, Joint Implementation

(JD, and the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). Other international instruments also
assessed in the WGIII TAR include coordinated or harmonized emission/carbon/energy
taxes, an emission/carbon/energy tax, technology and product standards, voluntary agreements
with industries, direct transfers of financial resources and technology, and coordinated
creation of enabling environments such as reduction of fossil-fuel subsidies. Some of these
have been considered only in some regions to date.

Transfer of technologies between countries and regions would
widen the choice of options at the regional level, and economies
of scale and learning will lower the costs of their adoption.

Adequate human and organizational capacity at every stage can increase the
flow, and improve the quality, of technologies transferred within and across
countries. The transfer of environmentally sound technologies has come to be seen as a
major element of global strategies to achieve sustainable development and climate change
mitigation. The local availability of technical, business, management, and regulatory skills
can enhance the flow of international capital, helping to promote technology transfer. Technical
skills are enhanced by the creation of competence in associated services, organizational
know-how, and capacity improvement to formulate and enforce regulations. Capacity building
is a continuous process that needs to keep up with the evolution of mitigation options as
they respond to technological and social changes.

Governments through sound economic policy and regulatory frameworks,
transparency, and political stability can create an enabling environment for
private- and public-sector technology transfers. At the macro-level, actions to
consider include reform of the legal system, protection of intellectual property rights, open
and competitive markets, reduced corruption, discouragement of restrictive business
practices, reform of export credit, political risk insurance, reduction of tied aid, development
of physical and communications infrastructure, and improvement of macro-economic stability.
At the sectoral and project levels, actions include fuel and electricity price rationalization,
energy industry institutional reform, improving land tenure, transparent project approval
procedures, ensuring assessment of local technology needs and social impact of technologies,
cross-country R&D on innovative technologies, and demonstration programs.

Networking among private and public stakeholders, and focusing on products
and techniques with multiple ancillary benefits that meet or adapt to local
development needs and priorities foster effective technology transfer. National
systems of innovation (NSJ) can help achieve this through activities such as (a) strengthening
educational institutions; (b) collection, assessment, and dissemination of technical,
commercial, financial, and legal information; (c) technology assessment, demonstration
projects, and extension services; (d) supporting market intermediary organizations; and (e)
innovative financial mechanisms. Increasing flows of national and multilateral assistance
can help to mobilize and multiply additional financial resources, including official development
assistance, to support NSI activities.

For participating countries, an increasing scale of international
cooperation, such as emissions trading"" and technology transfer,
will lower mitigation costs.

definitions) report on the costs of greenhouse gas mitigation. Estimates of the costs of
"	List
"Top-down models are aggregate models of the economy that often draw on analysis of historical trends
and relationships to predict the large-scale interactions between sectors of the economy, especially the
interactions between the energy sector and the rest of the economy. Top-down models typically
incorporate relatively little detail on energy consumption and technological change. The costs estimated
by top-down models usually range from zero to positive values. This is because negative cost options
estimated in bottom-up models are assumed to be adopted in both the baseline and policy scenarios.
This is an important factor in the differences in the estimates from these two types of models.
"	Text
"The inclusion of some factors will lead to lower cost estimates and others to higher estimates.
Incorporating multiple greenhouse gases, sinks, induced technical change, and emissions trading can
lower costs. Further, studies suggest that some sources of greenhouse gas emissions can be limited at
no or negative net social cost to the extent that policies can exploit no-regret opportunities such as
correcting market imperfections, inclusion of ancillary benefits, and efficient tax revenue recycling.
International cooperation that facilitates cost-effective emissions reductions can lower mitigation costs.
On the other hand, accounting for potential short-term macro shocks to the economy, constraints on the
use of domestic and international market mechanisms, high transaction costs, inclusion of ancillary
costs, and ineffective tax recycling measures can increase estimated costs. Since no analysis
incorporates all relevant factors affecting mitigation costs, estimated costs may not reflect the actual costs
of implementing mitigation actions.
"	Text
"For a variety of reasons, significant differences and uncertainties surround specific quantitative estimates
of mitigation costs. Cost estimates differ because of the (a) methodology used in the analysis, and (b)
underlying factors and assumptions built into the analysis. Bottom-up models incorporate detailed
studies of engineering costs of a wide range of available and anticipated technologies, and describe
energy consumption in great detail. However, they typically incorporate relatively little detail on non-
energy consumer behavior and interactions with other sectors of the economy. The costs estimated by
bottom-up models can range from negative values (due to the adoption of “no-regrets” options) to
positive values. Negative costs indicate that the direct energy benefits of a mitigation option exceed its
direct costs (net capital, operating, and maintenance costs). Market and institutional barriers, however,
can prevent, delay, or make more costly the adoption of these options. Inclusion of implementation and
policy costs would add to the costs estimated by bottom-up models.

limiting fossil-fuel greenhouse gas emissions vary widely and depend on choice of
methodologies, underlying assumptions, emissions scenarios, policy instruments, reporting
year, and other criteria.

Bottom-up studies indicate that substantial low-cost mitigation opportunities
exist. According to bottom-up assessments (see Box 7-1) of specific technologies and sectors,
half of the potential emissions reductions noted in Table 7-1 may be achieved by the year
2020 with direct benefits exceeding direct costs, and the other half at a net direct cost of up
to US$100 pert C,, (at 1998 prices). However, for reasons described below, the realized potential
may be different. These cost estimates are derived using discount rates in the range of 5 to
12%, consistent with public-sector discount rates. Private internal rates of return vary greatly,
and are often significantly higher, affecting the rate of adoption of these technologies by
private entities. Depending on the emissions scenario, this could allow global emissions to be
reduced below year 2000 levels in the period 2010-2020 at these net direct costs. Realizing
these reductions involves additional implementation costs, which in some cases may be
substantial, the possible need for supporting policies, increased R&D, effective technology
transfer, and overcoming other barriers. The various global, regional, national, sector, and project
studies assessed in the WGIII TAR have different scopes and assumptions. Studies do not
exist for every sector and region.

Cost estimates using bottom-up analyses reported to date for biological
mitigation vary significantly and do not consistently account for all significant
components of cost. Cost estimates using bottom-up analyses reported to date for biological
mitigation vary significantly from US$0.1 to about US$20 per t C in several tropical countries
and from US$20 to US$100 per t C in non-tropical countries. Methods of financial analyses

¢ For Annex II countries, the above modeling studies show reductions in GDP, compared
to projected levels in the year 2010. Figure 7-2 indicates that in the absence of Annex
B trading losses range from 0.2 to 2% of GDP. With Annex B trading, losses range from
0.1 to 1% of GDP. National studies, which explore a more diverse set of policy packages
and take account of specific national circumstances, vary even more widely.

° For most economies in transition, GDP effects range from negligible to a several percent
increase, reflecting opportunities for energy-efficiency improvements not available to Annex
II countries. Under assumptions of drastic energy-efficiency improvement and/or
continuing economic recessions in some countries, the assigned amounts may exceed
projected emissions in the first commitment period. In this case, models show increased
GDP due to revenues from trading assigned amounts. However, for some economies in

other recurring costs, which are often excluded or overlooked. The lower end of the range
is assessed to be biased downwards, but understanding and treatment of costs is improving
over time. Biological mitigation options may reduce or increase non-CO, greenhouse gas
emissions.

Projections of abatement cost of near-term policy options implemented without
Annex B emissions trade for meeting a given near-term CO, emissions target as
reported by several models” of the global economy (top-down models) vary
within regions (as shown by the brown lines in Figure 7-2a for Annex Il regions
and in Table 7-3a). Reasons for the differentiation among models within regions is due to
varying assumptions about future GDP growth rates and changes in carbon and energy
intensity (different socio-economic development paths). The same reasons also apply to
differences across regions. These models assume that national policy instruments are efficient
and consistent with international policy instruments. That is, they assume that reductions
are made through the use of market mechanisms (e.g., cap and trade) within each region.
To the extent that regions employ a mix of market mechanisms and command and control
policies, costs will likely be higher. On the other hand, inclusion of carbon sinks, non-CO,
greenhouse gases, induced technical change, ancillary benefits, or targeted revenue recycling
could reduce costs.

The models used in the above study show that the Kyoto mechanisms are
important in controlling risks of high costs in given countries, and thus could
complement domestic policy mechanisms, and could minimize risks of
inequitable international impacts. For example, the brown and blue lines in Figure 7-2b
and Table 7-3b show that the national marginal costs to meet the Kyoto targets range from
about US$20 up to US$600 per t C without Annex B trading, and range from about US$15
up to US$150 per t C with Annex B trading, respectively. At the time of these studies, most
models did not include sinks, non-CO, greenhouse gases, CDM, negative cost options,
ancillary benefits, or targeted revenue recycling, which will reduce estimated costs. On the
other hand, these models make assumptions which underestimate costs because they assume
full use of emissions trading without transaction costs, both within and among Annex B
countries, and that mitigation responses would be perfectly efficient and that economies
begin to adjust to the need to meet Kyoto targets between the years 1990 and 2000. The
cost reductions from Annex B trading will depend on the details of implementation, including

sinks; industry restructuring (e.g., from energy producer to supplier of energy services); use of OPEC’s market
power; and actions (e.g., of Annex B Parties) related to funding, insurance, and the transfer of technology. In
addition, the studies typically do not include the following policies and effects that can reduce the total cost of
mitigation: the use of tax revenues to reduce tax burdens or finance other mitigation measures; environmental
ancillary benefits of reductions in fossil-fuel use; and induced technical change from mitigation policies.

'° Carbon leakage is defined here as the increase in emissions in non-Annex B countries due to implementation of
reductions in Annex B, expressed as a percentage of Annex B reductions.

"The study reporting the highest costs shows reductions of 25% of projected oil revenues
with no emissions trading, and 13% of projected oil revenues with Annex B emissions
trading in the year 2010 (see Table 7-3c). These studies do not consider policies and
measures'® other than Annex B emissions trading, which could lessen the impact on
non-Annex I, oil-exporting countries, and therefore tend to overstate both the costs to
these countries and overall costs. The effects on these countries can be further reduced by
removal of subsidies for fossil fuels, energy tax restructuring according to carbon content,
increased use of natural gas, and diversification of the economies of non-Annex I, oil-
exporting countries.

Other non-Annex I countries: They may be adversely affected by reductions in demand
for their exports to OECD nations and by the price increase of those carbon-intensive
and other products they continue to import. These countries may benefit from the reduction
in fuel prices, increased exports of carbon-intensive products, and the transfer of
environmentally sound technologies and know-how. The net balance for a given country
depends on which of these factors dominates. Because of these complexities, the
breakdown of winners and losers remains uncertain.

Carbon leakage: The possible relocation of some carbon-intensive industries to non-
Annex I countries and wider impacts on trade flows in response to changing prices may
lead to leakage on the order of 5-20%.'° Exemptions (e.g., for energy-intensive industries)
make the higher model estimates for carbon leakage unlikely, but would raise aggregate
costs. The transfer of environmentally sound technologies and know-how, not included
in models, may lead to lower leakage and especially on the longer term may more than
offset the leakage.

0 Some sources of greenhouse gas emissions can be limited at no, or negative,
net social cost to the extent that policies can exploit no-regret opportunities.
This may be achieved by removal of market imperfections, accounting for
ancillary benefits (see Question 8), and recycling revenues to finance reductions
in distortionary taxes (“double dividend”).

¢ Market imperfections: Reduction of existing market or institutional failures and other
barriers that impede adoption of cost-effective emission reduction measures can lower
private costs compared to current practice. This can also reduce private costs overall.
¢ Ancillary benefits: Climate change mitigation measures will have effects on other societal
issues. For example, reducing carbon emissions in many cases will result in the simultaneous
reduction in local and regional air pollution. It is likely that mitigation strategies will also
affect transportation, agriculture, land-use practices, and waste management and will have
an impact on other issues of social concern, such as employment, and energy security.
However, not all of the effects will be positive; careful policy selection and design can better
ensure positive effects and minimize negative impacts. In some cases, the magnitude of
ancillary benefits of mitigation may be comparable to the costs of the mitigating measures,
adding to the no-regret potential, although estimates are difficult to make and vary widely.

Cost of stabilization depends on both the target and the emissions
pathway.

There is no single path to a low-emission future, and countries and regions
will have to choose their own path. Most model results indicate that known
technological options” could achieve a broad range of atmospheric CO,
stabilization levels, such as 550 ppmv, 450 ppmv, or below over the next 100
years or more, but implementation would require associated socio-economic
and institutional changes. To achieve stabilization at these levels, the scenarios suggest
that a very significant reduction in world carbon emissions per unit of GDP from year 1990
levels will be necessary. For the crucial energy sector, almost all greenhouse gas mitigation
and concentration stabilization scenarios are characterized by the introduction of efficient
technologies for both energy use and supply, and of low- or no-carbon energy. However,
no single technology option will provide all of the emissions reductions needed for
stabilization. Reduction options in non-energy sources and non-CO, greenhouse gases will
also provide significant potential for reducing emissions.

The development and diffusion of new economically competitive and
environmentally sound technology can substantially reduce the costs of

and concentration stabilization scenarios are characterized by the introduction of efficient
technologies for both energy use and supply, and of low- or no-carbon energy. However,
no single technology option will provide all of the emissions reductions needed for
stabilization. Reduction options in non-energy sources and non-CO, greenhouse gases will
also provide significant potential for reducing emissions.

The development and diffusion of new economically competitive and
environmentally sound technology can substantially reduce the costs of
stabilizing concentrations at a given level. A substantial body of work has considered
the implication of technology development and diffusion on the cost of meeting alternative
stabilization levels. The principal conclusion is that the cost of emissions mitigation depends
crucially on the ability to develop and deploy new technology. The value of successful
technology diffusion appears to be large and depends upon the magnitude and timing of
emissions mitigation, the assumed reference scenario, and the economic competitiveness
of the technology.

The pathway to stabilization can be as important as the stabilization level itself
in determining mitigation cost. Economic modeling studies completed since the SAR
indicate that a gradual near-term transition from the world’s present energy system towards
a less carbon-emitting economy minimizes costs associated with premature retirement of
existing capital stock. It also provides time for investment in technology development and
diffusion, and may reduce the risk of lock-in to early versions of rapidly developing low-
emission technology. On the other hand, more rapid near-term action would increase
flexibility in moving towards stabilization, decrease environmental and human risks
associated with rapid climatic changes, while minimizing potential implications of inertia
in climate and ecological systems (see Question 5). It may also stimulate more rapid
deployment of existing low-emission technologies and provide strong near-term incentives
to future technological changes that may help reduce the risks of lock-in to carbon-intensive
technologies. It also would give greater scope for later tightening of targets should that be
deemed desirable in light of evolving scientific understanding.

Cost-effectiveness studies with a century time scale estimate that the mitigation
costs of stabilizing CO, concentrations in the atmosphere increase as the
concentration stabilization level declines. Different baselines can have a

strong influence on absolute costs. While there is a moderate increase in the costs

Energy R&D and social learning can contribute to the flow and
adoption of improved energy technologies throughout the 21st
century.

Lower emissions scenarios require different patterns of energy resource
development and an increase in energy R&D to assist accelerating the
development and deployment of advanced environmentally sound energy
technologies. Emissions of CO, due to fossil-fuel burning are virtually certain to be the
dominant influence on the atmospheric CO, concentration trend during the 21st century.

baseline scenario are very low (see Figure 7-4). Although model projections indicate long-
term global growth paths of GDP are not significantly affected by mitigation actions towards
stabilization, these do not show the larger variations that occur over some shorter time periods,
sectors, or regions. These results, however, do not incorporate carbon sequestration, and did
not examine the possible effect of more ambitious targets on induced technological change.
Costs associated with each concentration level depend on numerous factors including the rate
of discount, distribution of emission reductions over time, policies and measures employed,
and particularly the choice of the baseline scenario. For scenarios characterized by a focus
on local and regional sustainable development for example, total costs of stabilizing at a
particular level are significantly lower than for other scenarios. Also, the issue of uncertainty
takes on increasing importance as the time frame is expanded.

change in the energy mix and the introduction of new sources of energy during the 21st
century. The choice of energy mix and associated technologies and investments—either
more in the direction of exploitation of unconventional oil and gas resources, or in the
direction of non-fossil energy sources or fossil energy technology with carbon capture and
storage—will determine whether, and if so, at what level and cost, greenhouse concentrations
can be stabilized.

The decline in energy R&D expenditure is inconsistent with the goal of
accelerating the development and deployment of advanced energy technologies.
Energy-related R&D expenditure by Annex II governments increased dramatically after
the 1970 oil price increases, but as a group it has decreased steadily in real terms since the
early 1980s. In some countries the decrease has been as great as 75%. The support for energy
conservation and renewable energy R&D has increased. However, other important energy
technologies relevant to climate change, such as, for example, commercial biomass and
carbon capture and storage, remain minor constituents of the energy R&D portfolio.

Social learning and innovation and changes in institutional structure could
contribute to climate change mitigation. Changes in collective rules and individual
behaviors may have significant effects on greenhouse gas emissions, but take place within a
complex institutional, regulatory, and legal setting. Several studies suggest that current incentive
systems can encourage resource-intensive production and consumption patterns that increase
greenhouse gas emissions in all sectors (e.g., transport and housing). In the shorter term, there
are opportunities to influence through social innovations individual and organizational behaviors.

” Approaches to equity have been classified into a variety of categories, including those based on allocation,
outcome, process, rights, liability, poverty, and opportunity, reflecting the diverse expectations of fairness used
to judge policy processes and the corresponding outcomes.

3 Emissions from all regions diverge from baselines at some point. Global emissions diverge earlier and to a greater
extent as stabilization levels are lower or underlying scenarios are higher. Such scenarios are uncertain, and do not

and society’s responses to them is likely to be great. Decisions about near-term climate
policies are in the process of being made while the concentration stabilization target is still
being debated. The literature suggests a step-by-step resolution aimed at stabilizing greenhouse
gas concentrations. This will also involve balancing the risks of either insufficient or excessive
action. The relevant question is not “what is the best course for the next 100 years,” but
rather “what is the best course for the near term given the expected long-term climate
change and accompanying uncertainties.”

Stabilizing atmospheric concentrations would depend upon emissions
reductions beyond those agreed to in the Kyoto Protocol. Most post-SRES
scenario analyses suggest that achievement of stabilization at 450 ppmv may require emission
reductions during the period 2008 to 2012 in Annex I countries that are significantly stronger
than the Kyoto Protocol commitments. This analysis also suggests that achieving the
aggregate Kyoto commitments may be consistent with trajectories that achieve stabilization
at 550 ppmv or higher. Other analyses suggest a more gradual departure from emissions
baselines even for 450 ppmv followed by sharper reductions in subsequent budget periods.
The path is influenced by the representation of inertia in the system and expectations about
how initial reductions by Annex I countries may relate to the strength and scope of emissions
limitation in subsequent periods.

Climate change mitigation raises both inter-regional and inter-
temporal equity considerations.

Differences in the distribution of technological, natural, and financial resources
among and within nations and regions, and between generations, as well as
differences in mitigation costs, are often key considerations in the analysis
of climate change mitigation options. Much of the debate about the future differentiation
of contributions of countries to mitigation and related equity issues also considers these
circumstances.” The challenge of addressing climate change raises an important issue of
equity, namely the extent to which the impacts of climate change or mitigation policies
ameliorate or exacerbate inequities both within and across nations and regions, and between
generations. Findings with respect to these different aspects of equity include:

¢ Equity within nations: Most studies show that the distributional effects of a carbon tax
are regressive unless the tax revenues are used either directly or indirectly in favor of
the low-income groups; the regressive aspect can be totally or partially compensated
by a revenue-recycling policy.

¢ Equity across nations and regions: Greenhouse gas stabilization scenarios assessed in
this report assume that developed countries and countries with economies in transition
limit and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions first. Another aspect of equity across
nations and regions is that mitigation of climate change can offset inequities that would
be exacerbated by the impacts of climate change (see Question 6).

° Equity between generations: Stabilization of concentrations depends more upon cumulative
than annual emissions; emissions reductions by any generation will reduce the need for
those by future generations.” Inter-generational equity can be promoted by reducing climate
change impacts through mitigation of climate change by any generation, since not only
would impacts—which are expected to affect especially those with the fewest resources—
be reduced, but also subsequent generations will have less climate change to adapt to
(see Question 6).

The answer to this question recognizes two major points. The first is that the human impacts on
the environment are manifested in several issues, many driven by common factors associated
with the meeting of human needs. The second is that many of these issues—their causes
and impacts—are biogeophysically and socio-economically interrelated. With a central
emphasis on climate change, this answer assesses the current understanding of the interrelations
between the causes and impacts of the key environmental issues of today. To that is added
a summary of the now largely separate policy approaches to these issues. In so doing, this
answer frames how choices associated with one issue may positively or negatively influence
another. With such knowledge, there is the prospect of efficient integrated approaches.

Local, regional, and global environmental issues often combine in
ways that jointly affect the sustainable meeting of human needs.

Meeting human needs is degrading the environment in many instances, and
environmental degradation is hampering the meeting of human needs. Society
has a range of socio-economic paths to development; however, these will only be sustainable
if due consideration is given to the environment. Environmental degradation is already evident
at the local, regional, and global scale, such as air pollution, scarcity of freshwater, deforestation,
desertification, acid deposition, loss of biological diversity and changes at the genetic and
species level, land degradation, stratospheric ozone depletion, and climate change. Very
frequently, addressing human needs causes or exacerbates several environmental problems,
which may increase the vulnerability to climatic changes. For example, with the aim of higher
agricultural production, there is increased use of nitrogeneous fertilizers, irrigation, and
conversion of forested areas to croplands. These agricultural activities can affect the Earth’s
climate through release of greenhouse gases, degrade land by erosion and salinization, and
reduce biodiversity. In turn, an environmental change can impact meeting human needs. For
example, agricultural productivity can be adversely affected by changes in the magnitude and
pattern of rainfall, and human health in an urban environment can be impacted by heat waves.

Just as different environmental problems are often caused by the same
underlying driving forces (economic growth, broad technological changes,
life-style patterns, demographic shifts (population size, age structure, and
migration), and governance structures), common barriers inhibit solutions to
a variety of environmental and socio-economic issues. Approaches to the amelioration
of environmental issues can be hampered by many of the same barriers, for example:
¢ Increased demand for natural resources and energy
¢ Market imperfections, including subsidies that lead to the inefficient use of resources
and act as a barrier to the market penetration of environmentally sound technologies;
the lack of recognition of the true value of natural resources; failure to appropriate for
the global values of natural resources at the local level; and failure to internalize the
costs of environmental degradation into the market price of a resource
¢ Limited availability and transfer of technology, inefficient use of technologies, and
inadequate investment in research and development for the technologies of the future

ozone pollution (nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and volatile organic compounds) also
contribute to the rise in global tropospheric ozone, making it the third most important
contributor to radiative forcing after CO, and CH, (see Figure 2-2). In some regions
emissions of ozone precursor substances are controlled by regional environmental treaties
(see Table 8-3) and other regulations.

Global climate changes and rising tropospheric ozone levels may exacerbate
urban air pollution problems. Projections based on some SRES scenarios show increases
in tropospheric ozone of more than 40 ppb over most of the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes.
Such increases would approximately double the baseline levels of ozone entering many metropolitan
regions, substantially degrading air quality. Climate change would affect the meteorological
conditions (regional temperature, cloud cover, and surface wind) that influence photochemistry,
and the occurrence of major pollution episodes. While warmer temperatures would generally
contribute to more urban ozone, the change in frequency and intensity of pollution episodes

Stratospheric Ozone Depletion and Climate Change

Depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer leads to an increased penetration
of UV-B radiation and to a cooling of the climate system. Ozone depletion has
allowed for increased penetration of UV-B radiation, with harmful effects on human and
animal health, plants, etc. During the last 2 decades, the observed losses of stratospheric
ozone have decreased the downward infrared emissions to the troposphere from the (now
colder) lower stratosphere. Stratospheric ozone depletion has also altered tropospheric ozone
concentrations, and, by allowing more ultraviolet sunlight into the troposphere, it has led
to more rapid photochemical destruction of CH, thereby reducing its radiative forcing.
These effects lead also to a cooling of the climate system.

Many of the halocarbons that cause depletion of the ozone layer are also important
greenhouse gases. Chlorofluorocarbons, for example, add a notable fraction to the
total positive radiative forcing since the pre-industrial era. The negative radiative forcing
from the associated stratospheric ozone depletion (noted above) reduces this by about half.
The Montreal Protocol will eventually eliminate both of these radiative-forcing contributions.
However, one class of substitutes for the now-banned chlorofluorocarbons is hydrofluorocarbons,
which are among the greenhouse gases listed under the Kyoto Protocol. This overlap can give
rise to a potential conflict beween the goals of the two Protocols.

Climate change will alter the temperature and wind patterns of the stratosphere,
possibly enhancing chlorofluorocarbon depletion of stratospheric ozone over
the next 50 years. Increases in greenhouse gases lead in general to a colder stratosphere,
which alters stratospheric chemistry. Some studies predict that current rates of climate change
will result in significant increases in the depletion of the Arctic stratospheric ozone layer
over the next decade before chlorofluorocarbon concentrations have declined substantially.
Although many climate/ozone-layer feedbacks have been identified, no quantitative consensus
is reached in this assessment.

Biodiversity, Agriculture and Forestry, and Climate Change

Changes in terrestrial and marine ecosystems are closely linked to changes
in climate and vice versa. Changes in climate and in atmospheric concentrations of CO,
cause changes in the biodiversity and function of some ecosystems. In turn, ecosystem changes
influence the land-atmosphere exchange of greenhouse gases (e.g., CO,, CH,, and N,O)
and of water and energy, and change surface albedo. Therefore, understanding these combined
effects and feedbacks are a requisite for evaluating the future state of the atmosphere and

degradation and desertification that has occurred over the past few centuries

"8.14 Natural climate variations have illustrated the impacts of climate change on |

natural and managed ecosystems. The impacts of floods, droughts, and heat waves
are etched into human history. Further, the warming events associated with El Nijio illustrate
that changes in climate patterns adversely affect fish, marine mammals, and coastal and
ocean biodiversity. Coastal ecosystems—such as coral reefs, salt marshes, and mangrove
forests—are affected by sea-level rise, warming ocean temperatures, increased CO,
concentrations, and changes in storm frequency and intensity. Table 8-1 gives main
implications of climate change for natural ecosystems at the regional scale.

8.15 Climate change is but one of many stresses on managed and unmanaged_|
ecosystems. Land-use change, resource demands, deposition of nutrients and pollutants,
harvesting, grazing, habitat fragmentation and loss, and invasive species are major stressors
on ecosystems. They can lead to species extinction, resulting in losses of biodiversity.
Therefore, climate change constitutes an additional stress and could change or endanger
ecosystems and the many services they provide. As a result, the impact of climate change
will be influenced by management of natural resources, adaptation, and interaction with
other pressures. Figure 8-2 exemplifies the manner in which climate change interacts with
other factors in food supply and demand.

8.16 Climate change can influence the distribution and migration of species in |
unmanaged ecosystems. Populations of many species are already threatened with
extinction and are expected to be placed at greater risk by the stresses of changing climate,
rendering portions of their current habitat unsuitable. Vegetation distribution models since
the SAR suggest that a mass ecosystem or biome movement is most unlikely to occur
because differerent species have different climate tolerance and different migration abilities,
and are affected differently by the arrival of new species. Lastly, in a related sense, climate
change can enhance the spreading of pests and diseases, thereby affecting both natural
ecosystems, crops, and livestock (e.g., changes in temperature and humidity thresholds
allow pests and diseases to move to new areas).

8.17 Carbon storage capacities of managed and unmanaged ecosystems, |
particularly forests, influence impacts and feedbacks with climate change.
For example, forests, agricultural lands, and other terrestrial ecosystems offer a significant
carbon mitigation potential. Although not necessarily permanent, conservation and
sequestration may allow time for other options to be further developed and implemented.
Terrestrial ecosystem degradation may be exacerbated by climate change, affecting the
storage of carbon, and adding to the stresses resulting from the current deforestation
practices. It should be noted that, if appropriate management practices are not carried out,
CO, emissions in the future could be higher. For example, abandoning fire management in
forests or reverting from direct seeding to intensive tillage in agriculture may result in
rapid loss of part, at least, of the accumulated carbon.

Some species with restricted climatic niches and that are unable to migrate due to fragmentation of

There is strong evidence that climate change can lead to the loss of specific ecosystem types (e.g.,
high alpine areas and specific coastal (salt marshes and inland prairie “potholes”) wetlands) (high

Some crops would benefit from modest warming accompanied by increasing CO), but effect
would vary among crops and regions (high confidence), including declines due to drought in some
areas of Canada’s Prairies and the U.S. Great Plains, potential increased food production in areas of
Canada north of current production areas, and increased warm temperate mixed forest production
(medium confidence). However, benefits for crops would decline at an increasing rate and possibly
become a net loss with further warming (medium confidence).

Unique natural ecosystems such as prairie wetlands, alpine tundra, and coldwater ecosystems will

The Arctic is extremely vulnerable to climate change, and major physical, ecological, and
economic impacts are expected to appear rapidly.

In the Antarctic projected climate change will generate impacts that will be realized slowly (high
confidence).

Warmer temperatures and reduced ice extent are likely to produce long-term changes in the physical
oceanography and ecology of the Southern Ocean, with intensified biological activity and
increased growth rate of fish.

Projected future climate change and sea-level rise will affect shifts in species composition and
competition. It is estimated that one out of every three (30%) known threatened plants are island
endemics, while 23% of bird species are threatened. Coral reefs, mangroves, and seagrass beds that
often rely on stable environmental conditions will be adversely affected by rising air and sea
temperatures and sea-level rise (medium confidence).

Declines in coastal ecosystems would negatively impact reef fish and threaten reef fisheries
(medium confidence).

brings a net loss of carbon to the atmosphere, as forests are

involve a variety of chemical treatments, most of them being nitrogen
fertilizers bringing the side effect of release of nitrogen gas
compounds (some of which are strong greenhouse gases) to
the atmosphere and nitrogen runoff into watersheds, with many
environmental and health implications. The expansion of irrigation
affects the supply of freshwater for other uses, leading to
shortages and conflicts over water-use rights. Meeting the needs
for increased agricultural production has the potential to increase

Freshwater and Climate Change

All three classes of freshwater problems—having too little, too much, and too
dirty water—may be exacerbated by climate change. Freshwater is essential for
human health, food production, and sanitation, as well as for manufacturing and other industrial
uses and sustaining ecosystems. There are several indicators of water resources stress. When
withdrawals are greater than 20% of the total renewable resources, water stress often is a
limiting factor on development. Withdrawals of 40% or more represent high stress. Similarly,
water stress may be a problem if a country or region has less than 1,700 m° yr"" of water per
capita. In the year 1990, approximately one-third of the world’s population lived in countries
using more than 20% of their water resources, and by the year 2025 about 60% of a larger
total would be living in such a stressed country, only because of population growth. Higher
temperatures could increase such stress conditions. However, adaptation through appropriate
water management practices can reduce the adverse impacts. While climate change is just
one of the stresses on water resources in this increasingly populated world, it is clear that it
is an important one (see Table 8-2). The TAR projections using the SRES scenarios of future

effects on other environmental problems:
¢ Inthe energy sector, greenhouse gas emissions as well as local and regional pollutants
could be reduced through more efficient and environmentally sound use of energy and
increasing the share of lower carbon emitting fossil fuels, advanced fossil-fuel
technologies (e.g., highly efficient combined cycle gas turbines, fuel cells, and combined
heat and power), and renewable energy technologies (e.g., increased use of environmentally
sound biofuels, hydropower, solar, wind- and wave-power). Increased use of biomass
as a substitute for fossil fuel could have positive or negative impacts on soils, biodiversity,
and water availability depending on the land use it replaces and the management regime.
¢ Inthe land-use sector, conservation of biological carbon pools not only prevents carbon
from being emitted into the atmosphere, it also can have a favorable effect on soil
productivity, prevent biodiversity loss, and reduce air pollution problems from biomass
burning. Carbon sequestration by plantation forestry can enhance carbon sinks and
protect soils and watersheds, but—if developed improperly—may have negative effects
on biodiversity and water availability. For example, in some implementations, monoculture
plantations could decrease local biodiversity.

3 Conversely, addressing environmental problems other than climate change
can have ancillary climate benefits, but the linkages between the various
problems may also lead to trade-offs. Examples include:

¢ There are likely to be substantial greenhouse gas benefits from policies aimed at reducing
air pollution. For example, increasing pollution is often associated with the rapidly
growing transportation sector in all regions, involving emissions of particulate matter

climate indicate a tendency for increased flood and drought risks for many areas under most
scenarios. Decreases of water availability in parts of a warmer world are projected in areas
like southern Africa and countries around the Mediterranean. Because of sea-level rise,
many coastal systems will experience saltwater intrusion into fresh groundwater and
encroachment of tidal water into estuaries and river systems, with consequential effects on
freshwater availability.

Water managers in some countries are beginning to consider climate change
explicitly, although methodologies for doing so are not yet well defined. By its
nature, water management is based around minimization of risks and adaptation to changing
circumstances, now also changing climate. There has been a gradual shift from “supply-
side” approaches (i.e., providing water to satisfy demands by increased capacity reservoirs
or structural flood defenses) towards “demand-side” approaches (i.e., trimming demands
adequately to match water availability, using water more efficiently, and non-structural
means of preparedness to floods and droughts).

Interactions between climate change and other environmental
problems offer opportunities to capture synergies in developing
response options, enhancing benefits, and reducing costs (see
Figure 1-1).

By capturing synergies, some greenhouse gas mitigation actions may yield
extensive ancillary benefits for several other environmental problems, but also
trade-offs may occur. Examples include, inter alia, reduction of negative environmental
impacts such as air pollution and acid deposition; protecting forests, soils, and watersheds;
reducing distortionary subsidies and taxes; and inducing more efficient technological change
and diffusion, contributing to wider goals of sustainable development. However, dependent
on the way climate change or other environmental problems are addressed, and the degree
to which interlinking issues are taken into account, significant trade-offs may occur and
unanticipated costs may be incurred. For example, policy options to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions from the energy and land-use sectors can have both positive and negative
effects on other environmental problems:
¢ Inthe energy sector, greenhouse gas emissions as well as local and regional pollutants
could be reduced through more efficient and environmentally sound use of energy and
increasing the share of lower carbon emitting fossil fuels. advanced fossil-fuel

on human health, agriculture, and forestry through increasing energy efficiency or
penetration of non-fossil-fuel energy can also reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

¢ Controlling sulfur emissions has positive impacts on human health and vegetation, but
sulfate aerosols partly offset the warming effect of greenhouse gases and therefore
control of sulfur emissions can amplify possible climate change. If sulfur emissions are
controlled through desulfurization of flue gases at power plants, an energy penalty
results, with associated increase of greenhouse gas emissions.

Adopting environmentally sound technologies and practices offer particular
opportunities for economically, environmentally, and socially sound development
while avoiding greenhouse gas-intensive activities. For example, the application
of supply- and demand-side energy-efficient technologies simultaneously reduces various
energy-related environmental impacts and can lower the pressure on energy investments,
reduce public investments, improve export competitiveness, and enlarge energy reserves.
The adoption of more sustainable agricultural practices (e.g., in Africa) illustrates the mutually
reinforcing effects of climate change mitigation, environmental protection, and long-term
economic benefits. The introduction or expansion of agroforestry and balanced fertilizer
agriculture can improve food security and at the same time reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
More decentralized development patterns based on a stronger role for small- and medium-
sized cities can decrease the migration of rural population into urban centers, reduce needs
for transportation, and allow the use of environmentally sound technologies (bio-fuel, solar
energy, wind, and small-scale hydropower) to tap the large reserves of natural resources.

Reducing vulnerability to climate change can often reduce vulnerability to
other environmental stresses and vice versa. Examples include, inter alia:
¢ Protecting threatened ecosystems: Removing societal stresses and managing resources
in a sustainable manner may help unique and threatened systems also to cope with the
additional stress posed by climate change. Accounting for potential climatic changes
and integration with socio-economic needs and development plans can make biodiversity
conservation strategies and climate change adaptation measures more effective.
¢ Land-use management: Addressing or avoiding land degradation also decreases
vulnerability to climate change, especially when response strategies consider the social
and economic factors defining the land-use practices together with the additional risks
imposed by climate change. In regions where deforestation is progressing and leading
to carbon loss and increased peak runoff, restoring vegetation by reforestation (and
when possible by afforestation) and revegetation can help to combat desertification.
¢ Freshwater management: Problems with availability, abundance, and pollution of
freshwater, which are often caused by demographic and development pressures, can be
exacerbated by climate change. Reducing vulnerability to water stress (e.g., by water
conservation, water-demand management, and more efficient water use) also reduces
vulnerability to additional stress by climate change.

Countries with limited economic resources, low levels of technology, poor
information systems, inadequate infrastructure, unstable and weak institutions,
and inequitable empowerment and access to resources are not only highly
vulnerable to climate change but also to other environmental problems, and
at the same time have limited capacity to adapt to these changing circumstances
and/or mitigate them. The capacity of these countries to adapt and mitigate can be
enhanced when climate policies are integrated with non-climate objectives of national policy
development and turned into broad transition strategies to achieve the long-term social and
technological changes required by both sustainable development and climate change
mitigation.

Agreat deal of interaction exists among the environmental issues that multilateral
environmental agreements address, and synergies can be exploited in their
implementation. Global environmental problems are addressed in a range of individual
conventions and agreements—the Vienna Convention and its Montreal Protocol, the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the United Nations Convention on
Biological Diversity, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, and the
United Nations Forum on Forests—as well as a range of regional agreements, such as the
Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution. Table 8-3 provides a list of
selected examples of such conventions and instruments. They may contain, inter alia, similar
requirements concerning common shared or coordinated governmental and civil institutions
to enact the general objectives—for example, formulation of strategies and action plans as
a framework for country-level implementation; collection of data and processing information
and new and strengthened capacities for both human resources and institutional structures;
and reporting obligations. Also they provide a framework within which synergies in scientific
assessment can be utilized (see Box 8-1).

"Introduction

9.1 The understanding of climate change, its impacts, and the options to mitigate
and adapt is developed through multi- and interdisciplinary research and
monitoring in an integrated assessment framework. As understanding deepens,
some findings become more robust and some uncertainties emerge as critical for informed
policy formulation. Some uncertainties arise from a lack of data and a lack of understanding
of key processes and from disagreement about what is known or even knowable. Other
uncertainties are associated with predicting social and personal behavior in response to
information and events. The uncertainties tend to escalate with the complexity of the problem,
as additional elements are introduced to include a more comprehensive range of physical,
technical, social, and political impacts and policy responses. The climate responds to human
influence without deliberation or choice; but human society can respond to climate change
deliberately, making choices between different options. An objective of the TAR and other
IPCC reports is to explore, assess, quantify, and, if possible, reduce these uncertainties.

9.2 Inthis report, a robust finding for climate change is defined as one that holds
under a variety of approaches, methods, models, and assumptions and one
that is expected to be relatively unaffected by uncertainties. A robust finding
can be expected to fall into the categories of well-established (high level of agreement and
high amount of evidence) and established but incomplete (high level of agreement, but
incomplete evidence) in the literature. Robustness is different from likelihood: A finding
that an outcome is “exceptionally unlikely” may be just as robust as the finding that it is
“virtually certain.” A major development in the TAR is that of the multiple alternative
pathways for emissions and concentrations of greenhouse gases as represented by the SRES.
Robust findings are those that are maintained under a wide range of these possible worlds.

9.3. Key uncertainties in this context are those which, if reduced, may lead to new
and robust findings in relation to the questions of this report. These findings
may, in turn, lead to better or more of the information that underpins policy making. The
uncertainties can never be fully resolved, but often they can be bounded by more evidence
and understanding, particularly in the search for consistent outcomes or robust conclusions.

9.4 Robust findings and key uncertainties can be brought together
in the context of an integrated assessment framework.

9.5 The integrated assessment framework described in this report is used to bring
together the robust findings and key uncertainties in the model projections.
Such a framework can encompass all the disciplines involved in understanding the climate,
the biosphere, and human society. It emphasizes the linkages between the systems described
in the different Working Group reports of the TAR as well as considers linkages between
climate change and other environmental issues, and helps to identify gaps in knowledge. It
suggests how key uncertainties can affect the whole picture. Figure 1-1 shows how adaptation
and mitigation can be integrated into the assessment. The human and natural systems will
have to adapt to climate change, and development will be affected. The adaptation will be
both autonomous and via government initiatives, and adaptation actions will reduce (but cannot
entirely avoid) some of the impacts of climate change on these systems and on development.
Adaptation actions provide benefits but also entail costs. Mitigation is unlike adaptation in
that it reduces emissions at the start of the cycle, it reduces concentrations (compared to
what would otherwise occur), and it reduces climate change and the risks and uncertainties
associated with climate change. It further reduces the need for adaptation, the impacts of
climate change, and effects on socio-economic development. It is also different in that mitigation
aims to address the impacts on the climate system, whereas adaptation is primarily oriented
to address localized impacts of climate change. The primary benefit of mitigation is avoided
climate change, but it also has costs. In addition, mitigation gives rise to ancillary benefits

(e.g., reduced air pollution leading to improvements in human health). A fully integrated approach
to climate change assessment would consider the whole cycle shown in Figure 1-1 dynamically
with all the feedbacks but this could not be accomplished in the TAR.

Many of the robust findings as listed in Table SPM-3 are concerned with the existence of
a climate response to human activities and the sign of the response. Many of the key
uncertainties are concerned with the quantification of the magnitude and/or the timing of
the response and the potential effects of improving methods and relaxing assumptions.

Attribution of Climate Change

There is now stronger evidence for a human influence on the global
climate.

An increasing body of observations gives a collective picture of a warming
world and modeling studies indicate that most of the observed warming at
the Earth’s surface over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to human
activities. Globally, the 1990s were very likely to have been the warmest decade in the
instrumental record (i.e., since the year 1861). For the Northern Hemisphere, the magnitude
of the warming in the last 100 years is likely to be the largest of any century during the past
1,000 years. Observations, together with model simulations, provide stronger evidence that
most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to the increase in greenhouse
gas concentrations. The observations also provide increased confidence in the ability of models
to project future climate change. Better quantification of the human influence depends on
reducing the key uncertainties relating to the magnitude and character of natural variability
and the magnitude of climate forcings due to natural factors and anthropogenic aerosols
(particularly indirect effects) and the relating of regional trends to anthropogenic climate change.

Future Emissions and Concentrations of Greenhouse Gases and
Aerosols

Human activities increase the atmospheric concentrations of
greenhouse gases.

Since the year 1750 (i.e., the beginning of the Industrial Revolution), the
atmospheric concentration of CO, (the largest contributor to anthropogenic
radiative forcing) has increased by 31% due to human activities, and all SRES
scenarios project substantial increases in the future (Figure 9-1a). Other
greenhouse gases have also increased in concentrations since the year 1750 (e.g., CH, by
150%, N,O by 17%). The present CO, concentration has not been exceeded during the
past 420,000 years (the span measurable in ice cores) and likely not during the past 20
million years. The rate of increase is unprecedented relative to any sustained global changes
over at least the last 20,000 years. In projections of greenhouse gas concentrations based
on the set of SRES scenarios (see Box 3-1), CO, concentrations continue to grow to the
year 2100. Most SRES scenarios show reductions in SO, emissions (precursor for sulfate
aerosols) by the year 2100 compared with the year 2000. Some greenhouse gases (e.g.,
CO,, N,O, perfluorocarbons) have long lifetimes (a century or more) for their residence in
the atmosphere, while the lifetime of aerosols is measured in days. Key uncertainties are
inherent in the assumptions that underlie the wide range of future emissions in the SRES
scenarios and therefore the quantification of future concentrations. These uncertainties
relate to population growth, technological progress, economic growth, and governance
structures, which are particularly difficult to quantify. Further, inadequate emission scenarios
have been available of lower atmosphere ozone and aerosol precursors. Smaller uncertainties
arise from lack of understanding of all the factors inherent in modeling the carbon cycle
and including the effects of climate feedbacks. Accounting for all these uncertainties leads

to a range of CO, concentrations in the year 2100 between about 490 and 1,260 ppm
(compared to the pre-industrial concentration of about 280 ppm and of about 368 ppm in
the year 2000).

Fossil-fuel CO, emissions are virtually certain to remain the dominant influence
on the trends in CO, concentrations over the 21st century. This is implied by the
range of SRES scenarios in which projected fossil-fuel emissions exceed the foreseeable
biospheric sources and sinks for CO,. It is estimated that, even if all the carbon so far released
by land-use changes could be restored to the terrestrial biosphere (e.g., by reforestation),
CO, concentration would be reduced by 40 to 70 ppm. There are key uncertainties in the
influence of changing land use and biospheric feedbacks on the uptake, storage, and release
of carbon that in turn could influence CO, concentrations.

Projected climate change will have beneficial and adverse effects
on both environmental and socio-economic systems, but the
larger the changes and the rate of change in climate, the more
the adverse effects predominate.

Regional changes in climate, particularly increases in temperature, have already
affected and will continue to affect a diverse set of physical and biological
systems in many parts of the world. Examples of observed changes include shrinkage
of glaciers, reductions in seasonal snow cover, thawing of permafrost, later freezing and earlier
break-up of ice on rivers and lakes, loss of Arctic sea ice, lengthening of mid- to high-latitude
growing seasons, poleward and altitudinal shifts of plant and animal ranges, changes in the
seasonal progression of some plants and animals, declines in some plant and animal populations,
and damage to coral reefs. These observed rates of change would be expected to increase

temperature continuing to rise during the 21st century at rates of rise that
are very likely to be without precedent during the last 10,000 years, based on
paleoclimate data (Figure 9-1b). It is very likely that nearly all land areas will warm
more rapidly than the global average, particularly those at high northern latitudes in the
cold season. There are very likely to be more hot days; fewer cold days, cold waves, and
frost days; and a reduced diurnal temperature range.

9.14 In a warmer world the hydrological cycle will become more intense. Global
average precipitation is projected to increase. More intense precipitation events (hence
flooding) are very likely over many areas. Increased summer drying and associated risk of
drought is likely over most mid-latitude continental interiors. Even with little or no change
in El Nifio amplitude, an increase in temperatures globally is likely to lead to greater extremes
of drying and heavy rainfall, and increase the risk of droughts and floods that occur with El
Nifio events in many different regions.

9.15 Inawarmer world the sea level will rise, primarily due to thermal expansion
and loss of mass from glaciers and ice caps, the rise being continued for
hundreds of years even after stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations.
This is due to the long time scales on which the deep ocean adjusts to climate change. Ice
sheets will continue to react to climate change for thousands of years. Models project that
a local warming (annually averaged) of larger than 3°C, sustained for many millennia,
would lead to virtually a complete melting of the Greenland ice sheet with a resulting sea-
level rise of about 7 m.

9.16 Key uncertainties that influence the quantification and the detail of future projections of
climate change are those associated with the SRES scenarios, and also those associated with
the modeling of climate change, in particular those that concern the understanding of key
feedback processes in the climate system, especially those involving clouds, water vapor,
and aerosols (including their indirect forcing). Allowing for these uncertainties leads to a range
of projections of surface temperature increase for the period 1990 to 2100 of 1.4 to 5.8°C
(see Figure 9-1b) and of sea-level rise from 0.09 to 0.88 m. Another uncertainty concerns
the understanding of the probability distribution associated with temperature and sea-level
projections for the range of SRES scenarios. Key uncertainties also affect the detail of
regional climate change and its impacts because of the limited capabilities of the regional
models, and the global models driving them, and inconsistencies in results between different
models especially in some areas and in precipitation. A further key uncertainty concerns
the mechanisms, quantification, time scales, and likelihoods associated with large-scale
abrupt/non-linear changes (e.g., ocean thermohaline circulation).

"increase with small increases in temperature. Plant productivity would decrease in most regions
of the world for warming beyond a few °C. In most tropical and subtropical regions, yields
are projected to decrease for almost any increase in temperature.

9.19 Ecosystems and species are vulnerable to climate change and other stresses é

(as illustrated by observed impacts of recent regional temperature changes)
and some will be irreversibly damaged or lost. Natural systems at risk include coral
reefs and atolls, mangroves, boreal and tropical forests, polar and alpine ecosystems, prairie
wetlands, and remnant native grasslands. While some species may increase in abundance
or range, climate change will increase existing risks of extinction of some more vulnerable
species and loss of biodiversity. It is well-established that the geographical extent of the
damage or loss, and the number of systems affected, will increase with the magnitude and
rate of climate change.

9.20 The adverse impacts of climate change are expected to fall disproportionately é
upon developing countries and the poor persons within countries. Projected
changes in climate extremes could have major consequences especially on water and food
security and on health. The vulnerability of human societies and natural systems to climate
extremes is demonstrated by the damage, hardship, and death caused by events such as
droughts, floods, heat waves, avalanches, landslides, and windstorms, which have shown
an increasing trend during recent decades. While overall precipitation is projected to increase,
there are likely to be much larger changes in intensity and frequency, which will increase
the likelihood of extremes of drying and precipitation, and thus droughts and floods during
the 21st century. These increases combined with increased water stress (occurring already because
of increasing demand) will affect food security and health especially in many developing
countries. Conversely, the frequency and magnitude of extreme low-temperature events, such
as cold spells, is projected to decrease in the future, with both positive and negative impacts.

9.21 Populations that inhabit small islands and low-lying coastal areas are at é
particular risk of severe social and economic effects from sea-level rise and
storm surges. Tens of millions of people living in deltas, low-lying coastal areas, and on
small islands will face risk of displacement. Further negative impacts will be increased by
saltwater intrusion and flooding due to storm surges and loss of coastal wetlands and slowing
down of river discharges.

9.22 Key uncertainties in the identification and quantification of impacts arise from the lack of é
reliable local or regional detail in climate change, especially in the projection of extremes,
inadequate accounting in impacts assessments for the effects of changes in extremes and
disasters, limited knowledge of some non-linear processes and feedbacks, uncertainties in
the costing of the damage due to climate impacts, lack of both relevant data and understanding
of key processes in different regions, and uncertainties in assessing and predicting the
response of ecological and social (e.g., impact of vector- and water-borne diseases), and
economic systems to the combined effect of climate change and other stresses such as
land-use change, local pollution, etc.

Costs and Benefits of Adaptation and Mitigation Options

9.23 Adaptation is a necessity; its cost can be reduced by anticipation,
analysis, and planning.

9.24 Adaptation is no longer an option, it is a necessity, given that climate changes é
and related impacts are already occurring. Anticipatory and reactive
adaptation, which will vary with location and sector, has the potential to reduce
adverse impacts of climate change, to enhance beneficial impacts, and to
produce many immediate ancillary benefits, but will not prevent all damages.

However, its potential is much more limited for natural systems than for human systems. The
capacity of different regions to adapt to climate change depends highly upon their current
and future states of socio-economic development and their exposure to climate stress.
Therefore the potential for adaptation is more limited for developing countries, which are
projected to be the most adversely affected. Adaptation appears to be easier if the climate
changes are modest and/or gradual rather than large and/or abrupt. If climate changes more
rapidly than expected in any region, especially with respect to climate extremes, then the
potential of adaptation to diminish vulnerability of human systems will be lessened.

The costs of adaptation can be reduced by anticipation and planned action,
and many costs may be relatively small, especially when adaptation policies
and measures contribute to other goals of sustainable development.

Key uncertainties regarding adaptations relate to the inadequate representation by models
of local changes, lack of foresight, inadequate knowledge of benefits and costs, possible side
effects including acceptability and speed of implementation, various barriers to adaptation,
and more limited opportunities and capacities for adaptation in developing countries.

The primary economic benefits of mitigation are the avoided costs
associated with the adverse impacts of climate change.

Greenhouse gas emission reduction (mitigation) action would lessen the
pressures on natural and human systems from climate change. Comprehensive,
quantitative estimates of global primary benefits of mitigating climate change do not exist.
For mean temperature increases over a few °C relative to the year 1990, impacts are
predominantly adverse, so net primary benefits of mitigation are positive. A key uncertainty
is the net balance of adverse and beneficial impacts of climate change for temperature
increases less than about a few °C. These averages conceal wide regional variations.

Mitigation generates costs and ancillary benefits.

Major reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions would be necessary
to achieve stabilization of their concentrations. For example, for the most important
anthropogenic greenhouse gas, carbon cycle models indicate that stabilization of atmospheric
CO, concentrations at 450, 650, or 1,000 ppm would require global anthropogenic CO,
emissions to drop below year 1990 levels within a few decades, about a century, or about
2 centuries, respectively, and continue to decrease steadily thereafter. Emissions would
peak in about | to 2 decades (450 ppm) and roughly a century (1,000 ppm) from the present.
Eventually stabilization would require CO, emissions to decline to a very small fraction of
current global emissions. The key uncertainties here relate to the possibilities of climate
change feedbacks and development pathways and how these affect the timing of emissions
reductions.

Mitigation costs and benefits vary widely across sectors, countries, and
development paths. In general, it is easier to identify sectors—such as coal, possibly oil
and gas, and some energy-intensive industries dependent on energy produced from these
fossil fuels—that are very likely to suffer an economic disadvantage from mitigation. Their
economic losses are more immediate, more concentrated, and more certain. The sectors
that are likely to benefit include renewable energy, services, and new industries whose
development is stimulated by demand for low-emission fuels and production techniques.
Different countries and development paths have widely different energy structures, so they
too have different costs and benefits from mitigation. Carbon taxes can have negative income
effects on low-income groups unless the tax revenues are used directly or indirectly to
compensate such effects.

"9.32 Emission constraints in Annex | countries have well established, albeit varied, ¢€
“spill-over” effects on non-Annex | countries. Analyses of the effects of emissions
constraints on Annex | countries report reductions below what would otherwise occur in
both projected GDP and in projected oil revenues for oil-exporting non-Annex I countries.

9.33 Lower emissions scenarios require different patterns of energy resource ¢€
development and an increase in energy R&D to assist accelerating the
development and deployment of advanced environmentally sound energy
technologies. Emissions of CO, due to fossil-fuel burning are virtually certain to be to the
dominant influence on the trend on the atmospheric CO, concentration during the 21st century.
Resource data assessed in the TAR may imply a change in the energy mix and the introduction
of new sources of energy during the 21st century. Fossil-fuel resources will not limit carbon
emissions during the 21st century. The carbon in proven conventional oil and gas reserves is
much less, however, than the cumulative carbon emissions associated with stabilization of co,
at levels of 450 ppm or higher.” These resource data may imply a change in the energy mix
and the introduction of new sources of energy during the 21st century. The choice of energy mix
and associated technologies and investments—either more in the direction of exploitation of
unconventional oil and gas resources, or in the direction of non-fossil energy sources, or fossil
energy technology with carbon capture and storage—will determine whether, and if so, at what
level and cost, greenhouse concentrations can be stabilized. Key uncertainties are the future relative
prices of energy and carbon-based fuels, and the relative technical and economic attractiveness
of non-fossil-fuel energy alternatives compared with unconventional oil and gas resources.

9.34 Significant progress in energy-saving and low-carbon technologies has been ¢

made since 1995, and the progress has been faster than anticipated in the
SAR. Net emission reductions could be achieved through, inter alia, improved techniques
in production and use of energy, shifts to low- or no-carbon technologies, CO, removal and
storage, improved land-use and forestry practices, and movement to more sustainable
lifestyles. Significant progress is taking place in the development of wind turbines, solar
energy, hybrid engine cars, fuel cells, and underground CO, storage. Key uncertainties are
(a) the likelihood of technological breakthroughs leading to substantial reductions in costs
and rapid take-up of low-carbon processes and products, and (b) the future scale of private
and public R&D expenditures on these technologies.

9.35 Studies examined in the TAR suggest substantial technological and other €
opportunities for lowering mitigation costs. National mitigation responses
to climate change can be more effective if deployed as a portfolio of policy
instruments to limit or reduce net greenhouse gas emissions. The costs of
mitigation are strongly affected by development paths, with those paths involving substantial
increases in greenhouse gas emissions requiring more mitigation to reach a stabilization target,
and hence higher costs. These costs can be substantially reduced or even turned into net
benefits with a portfolio of policy instruments (including those that help to overcome barriers)
to the extent that policies can exploit “no-regrets” opportunities in the following areas:

¢ Technological options: Technological options may achieve global emissions reductions
of 1.9 to 2.6 Gt C., yr by year 2010 and 3.6 to 5.0 Gt C, yr! by year 2020. Half of these
reductions may be realized with one component of their economic cost (net capital, operating,
and maintenance costs) with direct benefits exceeding direct costs, and the other half
with that component of their economic cost ranging from US$0 to US$100 per t C,,7°

gain without Annex I trading may expect a smaller change with trading. A key uncertainty
is the extent of the underlying costs, which vary widely across countries, and how these
cost estimates will be changed (a) when methods are improved and (b) when some of the
assumptions of the models are relaxed. Such assumptions are concerned with:
¢ Allowance for exemptions in the emission-permit trading in concert with other policies
and measures
¢ Consideration of various market imperfections
¢ Allowance for induced technical change
¢ Inclusion of ancillary benefits
* Opportunities for double dividends
¢ Inclusion of policies for non-CO, greenhouse gases and non-energy sources of all
greenhouse gases (e.g., CH, from agriculture)
* Offsets from sinks.

Although model projections indicate that long-term global growth paths of
GDP are not significantly affected by mitigation actions towards stabilization,
these do not show the larger variations that occur over some shorter time
periods, sectors, or regions.

Unexpected public policies (“quick fixes”) with sudden short-term effects may
cost economies much more than expected policies with gradual effects. A
key uncertainty in the magnitude of the costs lies in the existence of well-designed
contingency plans in the event of policy shifts (e.g., as a result of a sudden shift in public

"extent, and nature of any barriers that impede adoption of promising low-emission
technologies, and the estimation of the costs of overcoming the barriers.

¢ Ancillary benefits: Depending on factors (such as location of the greenhouse gas emissions,
the prevailing local climate, and the population density, composition, and health) the
magnitude of the ancillary benefits of mitigation may be comparable to the costs of the
mitigating policies and measures. Key uncertainties are the magnitude and location of
these benefits involving the scientific assessment and valuation of health risks of air
pollution, particularly those involving fine aerosols and particles.

¢ Double dividends: Instruments (such as taxes or auctioned permits) provide revenues
to the government. If used to finance reductions in existing distortionary taxes (“revenue
recycling”), these revenues reduce the economic cost of achieving greenhouse gas reductions.
The magnitude of this offset depends on the existing tax structure, type of tax cuts,
labor market conditions, and method of recycling. Under some circumstances, it is possible
that the economic benefits may exceed the costs of mitigation. Key uncertainties regarding
the overall net costs of mitigation vary between countries, depending on the existing
tax structure, the extent of the distortion, and the type of tax cuts that are acceptable.

5 Modeling studies show that emissions trading reduces costs of mitigation
for those participating in the trading. Global modeling studies, with results depending
strongly upon assumptions, project that costs of mitigation based on Kyoto targets are
likely to be reduced by full carbon-permit trading within the Annex B”’ group of countries.
Annex I OECD” countries may expect aggregate costs to be reduced by about half through
full permit trading. Annex I economies in transition are projected to be unaffected or to
gain several percent increase in GDP. Oil-exporting, non-Annex I countries may also expect
similar reductions in costs under such trading. The aggregate effects of trading are expected
to be positive for other non-Annex I countries. Those countries that may expect a loss or
gain without Annex I trading may expect a smaller change with trading. A key uncertainty
is the extent of the underlying costs, which vary widely across countries, and how these
cost estimates will be changed (a) when methods are improved and (b) when some of the
assumptions of the models are relaxed. Such assumptions are concerned with:

perception of the climate change). Other key uncertainties for costs lie in the possibilities
of the rapid short-term effects including, or leading to, abrupt reductions in costs of low-
carbon processes and products, shifts towards low-emission technologies, and/or changes
towards more sustainable lifestyles.

Near-term action in mitigation and adaptation would reduce risks. Because of
the long time lags associated both with the climate system (e.g., ~100 years for atmospheric
CO,) and with human response, near-term action in mitigation and adaptation would reduce
risks. Inertia in the interacting climate, ecological, and socio-economic systems is a major
reason why anticipatory adaptation and mitigation actions are beneficial.

Adaptation can complement mitigation in a cost-effective strategy to reduce
climate change risks; together they can contribute to sustainable development
objectives. Some future paths that focus on the social, economic, and environmental
elements of sustainable development may result in lower greenhouse gas emissions than
other paths, so that the level of additional policies and measures required for a particular
level of stabilization and any associated costs can also be lower. A key uncertainty is the
lack of appropriate knowledge on the interactions between climate change and other
environmental issues and the related socio-economic implications. A related issue is the
pace of change in integrating the main global conventions and protocols associated with
climate change (e.g., those involving world trade, transboundary pollution, biodiversity,
desertification, stratospheric ozone depletion, health, and food security). It is also uncertain
at which rate individual countries will integrate sustainable development concepts into
policy-making processes.

Development paths that meet sustainable development objectives may result
in lower levels of greenhouse gas emissions. Key choices about future development
paths and the future of the climate are being made now in both developed and developing
countries. Information is available to help decision makers evaluate benefits and costs
from adaptation and mitigation over a range of options and sustainable development
pathways. Anticipated adaptation could be much less costly than reactive adaptation.
Mitigation of climate change can reduce and postpone the impacts, lowering the damages
and giving human societies as well as animals and plants more time to adapt.

knowledge required to understand climate change and the human response

atmosphere has changed by +0.05 + 0.10°C per decade,
but the global average surface temperature has increased
significantly by +0.15 +0.05°C per decade. The difference
in the warming rates is statistically significant. This difference
occurs primarily over the tropical and sub-tropical regions.
* The lowest 8 kilometres of the atmosphere and the surface
are influenced differently by factors such as stratospheric
ozone depletion, atmospheric aerosols, and the El Nifio
phenomenon. Hence, it is physically plausible to expect
that over a short time period (e.g., 20 years) there may be
differences in temperature trends. In addition, spatial

effects. The record shows a great deal of variability; for
example, most of the warming occurred during the 20th
century, during two periods, 1910 to 1945 and 1976 to 2000.
Globally, it is very likely’ that the 1990s was the warmest
decade and 1998 the warmest year in the instrumental
record, since 1861 (see Figure 1a).

New analyses of proxy data for the Northern Hemisphere
indicate that the increase in temperature in the 20th century
is likely’ to have been the largest of any century during the
past 1,000 years. It is also likely’ that, in the Northern
Hemisphere, the 1990s was the warmest decade and 1998
the warmest year (Figure 1b). Because less data are
available, less is known about annual averages prior to
1,000 years before present and for conditions prevailing
in most of the Southern Hemisphere prior to 1861.

On average, between 1950 and 1993, night-time daily
minimum air temperatures over land increased by about
0.2°C per decade. This is about twice the rate of increase
in daytime daily maximum air temperatures (0.1°C per
decade). This has lengthened the freeze-free season in many
mid- and high latitude regions. The increase in sea surface
temperature over this period is about half that of the mean
land surface air temperature.

Figure 1: Variations of the Earth’s surface temperature over the last 140 years and the last millennium. (a) The Earth’s surface
temperature is shown year by year (red bars) and approximately decade by decade (black line, a filtered annual curve suppressing fluctuations
below near decadal time-scales). There are uncertainties in the annual data (thin black whisker bars represent the 95% confidence range)
due to data gaps, random instrumental errors and uncertainties, uncertainties in bias corrections in the ocean surface temperature data and
also in adjustments for urbanisation over the land. Over both the last 140 years and 100 years, the best estimate is that the global average
surface temperature has increased by 0.6 + 0.2°C. (b) Additionally, the year by year (blue curve) and 50 year average (black curve) variations
of the average surface temperature of the Northern Hemisphere for the past 1000 years have been reconstructed from “proxy” data calibrated
against thermometer data (see list of the main proxy data in the diagram). The 95% confidence range in the annual data is represented by
the grey region. These uncertainties increase in more distant times and are always much larger than in the instrumental record due to the use
of relatively sparse proxy data. Nevertheless the rate and duration of warming of the 20th century has been much greater than in any of the
previous nine centuries. Similarly, it is likely’ that the 1990s have been the warmest decade and 1998 the warmest year of the millennium.

Figure 3: Many external factors force climate change. These radiative forcings arise from changes in the atmospheric composition, alteration
of surface reflectance by land use, and variation in the output of the sun. Except for solar variation, some form of human activity is linked to
each. The rectangular bars represent estimates of the contributions of these forcings - some of which yield warming, and some cooling. Forcing
due to episodic volcanic events, which lead to a negative forcing lasting only for a few years, is not shown. The indirect effect of aerosols shown
is their effect on the size and number of cloud droplets. A second indirect effect of aerosols on clouds, namely their effect on cloud lifetime, which
would also lead to a negative forcing, is not shown. Effects of aviation on greenhouse gases are included in the individual bars. The vertical
line about the rectangular bars indicates a range of estimates, guided by the spread in the published values of the forcings and physical
understanding. Some of the forcings possess a much greater degree of certainty than others. A vertical line without a rectangular bar
denotes a forcing for which no best estimate can be given owing to large uncertainties. The overall level of scientific understanding for each
forcing varies considerably, as noted. Some of the radiative forcing agents are well mixed over the globe, such as CO,, thereby perturbing the
global heat balance. Others represent perturbations with stronger regional signatures because of their spatial distribution, such as aerosols.
For this and other reasons, a simple sum of the positive and negative bars cannot be expected to yield the net effect on the climate system.
The simulations of this assessment report (for example, Figure 5) indicate that the estimated net effect of these perturbations is to have
warmed the global climate since 1750. [Based upon Chapter 6, Figure 6.6]

exceeded during the past 420,000 years. The annual growth
in CH, concentration slowed and became more variable in
the 1990s, compared with the 1980s. Slightly more than
half of current CH, emissions are anthropogenic (e.g., use
of fossil fuels, cattle, rice agriculture and landfills). In
addition, carbon monoxide (CO) emissions have recently
been identified as a cause of increasing CH, concentration.
The atmospheric concentration of nitrous oxide (N,O) has
increased by 46 ppb (17%) since 1750 and continues to
increase. The present N,O concentration has not been
exceeded during at least the past thousand years. About a
third of current N,O emissions are anthropogenic (e.g.,
agricultural soils, cattle feed lots and chemical industry).
Since 1995, the atmospheric concentrations of many of
those halocarbon gases that are both ozone-depleting and
greenhouse gases (e.g., CFCl, and CF,Cl,), are either
increasing more slowly or decreasing, both in response to
reduced emissions under the regulations of the Montreal
Protocol and its Amendments. Their substitute compounds
(e.g., CHF,Cl and CF,CH,F) and some other synthetic
compounds (e.g., perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur
hexafluoride (SF,)) are also greenhouse gases, and their
concentrations are currently increasing.

The radiative forcing due to increases of the well-mixed
greenhouse gases from 1750 to 2000 is estimated to be
2.43 Wm: 1.46 Wm? from CO,; 0.48 Wm? from CH,;
0.34 Wm? from the halocarbons; and 0.15 Wm? from N,O.
(See Figure 3, where the uncertainties are also illustrated.)
The observed depletion of the stratospheric ozone (O,)
layer from 1979 to 2000 is estimated to have caused a
negative radiative forcing (-0.15 Wm”). Assuming full
compliance with current halocarbon regulations, the
positive forcing of the halocarbons will be reduced as will
the magnitude of the negative forcing from stratospheric
ozone depletion as the ozone layer recovers over the 21st
century.

The total amount of O, in the troposphere is estimated to
have increased by 36% since 1750, due primarily to
anthropogenic emissions of several O,-forming gases. This
corresponds to a positive radiative forcing of 0.35 Wm.
O, forcing varies considerably by region and responds
much more quickly to changes in emissions than the long-

natural and anthropogenic causes. The simulations represented by the band in (a) were done with only natural forcings: solar variation and
volcanic activity. Those encompassed by the band in (b) were done with anthropogenic forcings: greenhouse gases and an estimate of
sulphate aerosols, and those encompassed by the band in (c) were done with both natural and anthropogenic forcings included. From (b), it
can be seen that inclusion of anthropogenic forcings provides a plausible explanation for a substantial part of the observed temperature
changes over the past century, but the best match with observations is obtained in (c) when both natural and anthropogenic factors are
included. These results show that the forcings included are sufficient to explain the observed changes, but do not exclude the possibility that
other forcings may also have contributed. The bands of model results presented here are for four runs from the same model. Similar results
to those in (b) are obtained with other models with anthropogenic forcing. [Based upon Chapter 12, Figure 12.7]

'© Complex physically based climate models are the main tool for projecting

whose climate sensitivity and ocean heat uptake are calibrated to each
of seven complex climate models. The climate sensitivity used in the
simple model ranges from 1.7 to 4.2°C, which is comparable to the

warming is likely’ to lie in the range of 0.1 to 0.2°C per
decade over the next few decades under the IS92a scenario,

simple model used in Figure 5d.

Based on recent global model simulations, it is very likely’
that nearly all land areas will warm more rapidly than the
global average, particularly those at northern high latitudes
in the cold season. Most notable of these is the warming in
the northern regions of North America, and northern and
central Asia, which exceeds global mean warming in each
model by more than 40%. In contrast, the warming is less
than the global mean change in south and southeast Asia
in summer and in southern South America in winter.

Temperature increases are projected to be greater than those
in the SAR, which were about 1.0 to 3.5°C based on the
six IS92 scenarios. The higher projected temperatures and
the wider range are due primarily to the lower projected
sulphur dioxide emissions in the SRES scenarios relative
to the IS92 scenarios.

The projected rate of warming is much larger than the
observed changes during the 20th century and is very likely’
to be without precedent during at least the last 10,000 years,
based on palaeoclimate data.

By 2100, the range in the surface temperature response
across the group of climate models run with a given
scenario is comparable to the range obtained from a single
model run with the different SRES scenarios.

"Emissions of long-lived greenhouse gases (i.e., CO, ,N,O,
PFCs, SF,) have a lasting effect on atmospheric composition,
radiative forcing and climate. For example, several centuries
after CO, emissions occur, about a quarter of the increase
in CO, concentration caused by these emissions is still
present in the atmosphere.

After greenhouse gas concentrations have stabilised, global
average surface temperatures would rise at a rate of only
a few tenths of a degree per century rather than several
degrees per century as projected for the 21st century
without stabilisation. The lower the level at which
concentrations are stabilised, the smaller the total
temperature change.

Global mean surface temperature increases and rising sea
level from thermal expansion of the ocean are projected
to continue for hundreds of years after stabilisation of
greenhouse gas concentrations (even at present levels),
owing to the long timescales on which the deep ocean
adjusts to climate change.

Ice sheets will continue to react to climate warming and
contribute to sea level rise for thousands of years after
climate has been stabilised. Climate models indicate that
the local warming over Greenland is likely’ to be one to
three times the global average. Ice sheet models project
that a local warming of larger than 3°C, if sustained for
millennia, would lead to virtually a complete melting of
the Greenland ice sheet with a resulting sea level rise of
about 7 metres. A local warming of 5.5°C, if sustained for
1000 years, would be likely’ to result in a contribution
from Greenland of about 3 metres to sea level rise.

' Climate change in IPCC usage refers to any change in climate over
time, whether due to natural variability or as a result of human activity.
This usage differs from that in the Framework Convention on Climate
Change, where climate change refers to a change of climate that is
attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the
composition of the global atmosphere and that is in addition to natural
climate variability observed over comparable time periods. For a definition
of scientific and technical terms: see the Glossary in Appendix I.

"The scope of the assessments of Working Group I includes
observations of the current changes and trends in the climate
system, a reconstruction of past changes and trends, an
understanding of the processes involved in those changes, and
the incorporation of this knowledge into models that can attribute
the causes of changes and that can provide simulation of natural
and human-induced future changes in the climate system.

"Atits first session, the IPCC was organised into three Working
Groups. The current remits of the Working Groups are for
Working Group I to address the scientific aspects of the climate
system and climate change, Working Group II to address the
impacts of and adaptations to climate change, and Working
Group III to address the options for the mitigation of climate
change. The IPCC provided its first major assessment report
in 1990 and its second major assessment report in 1996.

"The IPCC reports are (i) up-to-date descriptions of the knowns
and unknowns of the climate system and related factors, (ii)
based on the knowledge of the international expert communities,
(iii) produced by an open and peer-reviewed professional
process, and (iv) based upon scientific publications whose
findings are summarised in terms useful to decision makers.
While the assessed information is policy relevant, the IPCC
does not establish or advocate public policy.

"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was
established by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO)
and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in
1988. The aim was, and remains, to provide an assessment of
the understanding of all aspects of climate change’, including
how human activities can cause such changes and can be
impacted by them. It had become widely recognised that
human-influenced emissions of greenhouse gases have the
potential to alter the climate system (see Box 1), with possible
deleterious or beneficial effects. It was also recognised that
addressing such global issues required organisation on a global
scale, including assessment of the understanding of the issue
by the worldwide expert communities.
"	Text
"In the First Assessment Report in 1990, Working Group I
broadly described the status of the understanding of the climate
system and climate change that had been gained over the preceding
decades of research. Several major points were emphasised.
The greenhouse effect is a natural feature of the planet, and its
fundamental physics is well understood. The atmospheric
abundances of greenhouse gases were increasing, due largely
to human activities. Continued future growth in greenhouse
gas emissions was predicted to lead to significant increases in
the average surface temperature of the planet, increases that
would exceed the natural variation of the past several millennia
and that could be reversed only slowly. The past century had,
at that time, seen a surface warming of nearly 0.5°C, which
was broadly consistent with that predicted by climate models
for the greenhouse gas increases, but was also comparable to
what was then known about natural variation. Lastly, it was
pointed out that the current level of understanding at that time
and the existing capabilities of climate models limited the
prediction of changes in the climate of specific regions.
"	Text
"Based on the results of additional research and Special Reports
produced in the interim, IPCC Working Group I assessed the
new state of understanding in its Second Assessment Report
(SAR?) in 1996. The report underscored that greenhouse gas
abundances continued to increase in the atmosphere and that
very substantial cuts in emissions would be required for
stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere
(which is the ultimate goal of Article 2 of the Framework
Convention on Climate Change). Further, the general increase
in global temperature continued, with recent years being the
warmest since at least 1860. The ability of climate models to
simulate observed events and trends had improved, particularly
with the inclusion of sulphate aerosols and stratospheric ozone
as radiative forcing agents in climate models. Utilising this
simulative capability to compare to the observed patterns of
regional temperature changes, the report concluded that the
ability to quantify the human influence on global climate was
limited. The limitations arose because the expected signal was
still emerging from the noise of natural variability and because
of uncertainties in other key factors. Nevertheless, the report
also concluded that “the balance of evidence suggests a
discernible human influence on global climate”. Lastly, based
on arange of scenarios of future greenhouse gas abundances,
a set of responses of the climate system was simulated.

"Volcanic activity can inject large amounts of sulphur-
containing gases (primarily sulphur dioxide) into the
stratosphere, which are transformed into sulphate aerosols.
Individual eruptions can produce a large, but transitory,
negative radiative forcing, tending to cool the Earth’s surface
and lower atmosphere over periods of a few years.
"	Text
"The Sun’s output of energy varies by small amounts (0.1%)
over an 11-year cycle and, in addition, variations over longer
periods may occur. On time-scales of tens to thousands of
years, slow variations in the Earth’s orbit, which are well
understood, have led to changes in the seasonal and latitudinal
distribution of solar radiation. These changes have played an
important part in controlling the variations of climate in the
distant past, such as the glacial and inter-glacial cycles.
"	Text
"When radiative forcing changes, the climate system responds
on various time-scales. The longest of these are due to the
large heat capacity of the deep ocean and dynamic adjustment
of the ice sheets. This means that the transient response to a
change (either positive or negative) may last for thousands
of years. Any changes in the radiative balance of the Earth,
including those due to an increase in greenhouse gases or in
aerosols, will alter the global hydrological cycle and
atmospheric and oceanic circulation, thereby affecting
weather patterns and regional temperatures and precipitation.
"	Text
"Anthropogenic aerosols (microscopic airborne particles or
droplets) in the troposphere, such as those derived from fossil
fuel and biomass burning, can reflect solar radiation, which
leads to a cooling tendency in the climate system. Because it
can absorb solar radiation, black carbon (soot) aerosol tends
to warm the climate system. In addition, changes in aerosol
concentrations can alter cloud amount and cloud reflectivity
through their effect on cloud properties and lifetimes. In most
cases, tropospheric aerosols tend to produce a negative
radiative forcing and a cooler climate. They have a much
shorter lifetime (days to weeks) than most greenhouse gases
"	Text
"The Earth absorbs radiation from the Sun, mainly at the
surface. This energy is then redistributed by the atmospheric
and oceanic circulations and radiated back to space at longer
(infrared) wavelengths. For the annual mean and for the Earth
as a whole, the incoming solar radiation energy is balanced
approximately by the outgoing terrestrial radiation. Any factor
that alters the radiation received from the Sun or lost to space,
or that alters the redistribution of energy within the
atmosphere and between the atmosphere, land, and ocean,
can affect climate. A change in the net radiative energy
available to the global Earth-atmosphere system is termed
here, and in previous IPCC reports, a radiative forcing.
Positive radiative forcings tend to warm the Earth’s surface
and lower atmosphere. Negative radiative forcings tend to
cool them.
"	Text
"Any human-induced changes in climate will be embedded in
a background of natural climatic variations that occur on a
whole range of time- and space-scales. Climate variability
can occur as a result of natural changes in the forcing of the
climate system, for example variations in the strength of the
incoming solar radiation and changes in the concentrations
of aerosols arising from volcanic eruptions. Natural climate
variations can also occur in the absence of a change in external
forcing, as a result of complex interactions between components
of the climate system, such as the coupling between the
atmosphere and ocean. The El Nifio-Southern Oscillation
(ENSO) phenomenon is an example of such natural “internal”
variability on interannual time-scales. To distinguish
anthropogenic climate changes from natural variations, it is
necessary to identify the anthropogenic “signal” against the
background “noise” of natural climate variability.
"	Text
"Increases in the concentrations of greenhouse gases will reduce
the efficiency with which the Earth’s surface radiates to space.
More of the outgoing terrestrial radiation from the surface is
absorbed by the atmosphere and re-emitted at higher altitudes
and lower temperatures. This results in a positive radiative
forcing that tends to warm the lower atmosphere and surface.
Because less heat escapes to space, this is the enhanced
greenhouse effect — an enhancement of an effect that has
operated in the Earth’s atmosphere for billions of years due
to the presence of naturally occurring greenhouse gases: water
vapour, carbon dioxide, ozone, methane and nitrous oxide.
The amount of radiative forcing depends on the size of the
increase in concentration of each greenhouse gas, the radiative
properties of the gases involved, and the concentrations of
other greenhouse gases already present in the atmosphere.
Further, many greenhouse gases reside in the atmosphere for
centuries after being emitted, thereby introducing a long-term
commitment to positive radiative forcing.

"The global average surface temperature has increased by 0.6

1990s was the warmest decade and 1998 the warmest year in
the instrumental record since 1861 (see Figure 2). The main
cause of the increased estimate of global warming of 0.15°C
since the SAR is related to the record warmth of the additional
six years (1995 to 2000) of data. A secondary reason is related
to improved methods of estimating change. The current,
slightly larger uncertainty range (+0.2°C, 95% confidence
interval) is also more objectively based. Further, the scientific
basis for confidence in the estimates of the increase in global
temperature since the late 19th century has been strengthened
since the SAR. This is due to the improvements derived from
several new studies. These include an independent test of the
corrections used for time-dependent biases in the sea surface
temperature data and new analyses of the effect of urban “heat
island” influences on global land-temperature trends. As

"This Section provides an updated summary of the observations
that delineate how the climate system has changed in the past.
Many of the variables of the climate system have been
measured directly, i.e., the “instrumental record”. For example,
widespread direct measurements of surface temperature began
around the middle of the 19th century. Near global observations
of other surface “weather” variables, such as precipitation and
winds, have been made for about a hundred years. Sea level
measurements have been made for over 100 years in some
places, but the network of tide gauges with long records
provides only limited global coverage. Upper air observations
have been made systematically only since the late 1940s. There
are also long records of surface oceanic observations made
from ships since the mid-19th century and by dedicated buoys
since about the late 1970s. Sub-surface oceanic temperature
measurements with near global coverage are now available
from the late 1940s. Since the late 1970s, other data from
Earth-observation satellites have been used to provide a wide
range of global observations of various components of the
climate system. In addition, a growing set of palaeoclimatic
data, e.g., from trees, corals, sediments, and ice, are giving
information about the Earth’s climate of centuries and millennia
before the present.

"1,000 years. The 1990s are likely to have been the warmest
decade of the millennium in the Northern Hemisphere, and
1998 is likely to have been the warmest year. There has been
a considerable advance in understanding of temperature change
that occurred over the last millennium, especially from the
synthesis of individual temperature reconstructions. This new
detailed temperature record for the Northern Hemisphere is
shown in Figure 5. The data show a relatively warm period
associated with the 11th to 14th centuries and a relatively cool
period associated with the 15th to 19th centuries in the
Northern Hemisphere. However, evidence does not support
these “Medieval Warm Period” and “Little Ice Age” periods,
respectively, as being globally synchronous. As Figure 5
indicates, the rate and duration of warming of the Northern
Hemisphere in the 20th century appears to have been
unprecedented during the millennium, and it cannot simply
be considered as a recovery from the “Little Ice Age” of the
15th to 19th centuries. These analyses are complemented by
sensitivity analysis of the spatial representativeness of available
palaeoclimatic data, indicating that the warmth of the recent
decade is outside the 95% confidence interval of temperature
uncertainty, even during the warmest periods of the last
millennium. Moreover, several different analyses have now
been completed, each suggesting that the Northern Hemisphere
temperatures of the past decade have been warmer than any
other time in the past six to ten centuries. This is the time-
span over which temperatures with annual resolution can be
calculated using hemispheric-wide tree-ring, ice-cores, corals,
and and other annually-resolved proxy data. Because less data
are available, less is known about annual averages prior to
1,000 years before the present and for conditions prevailing
in most of the Southern Hemisphere prior to 1861.

"Surface, balloon and satellite temperature measurements show
that the troposphere and Earth’s surface have warmed and
that the stratosphere has cooled. Over the shorter time period
for which there have been both satellite and weather balloon
data (since 1979), the balloon and satellite records show
significantly less lower-tropospheric warming than observed
at the surface. Analyses of temperature trends since 1958 for
the lowest 8 km of the atmosphere and at the surface are in
good agreement, as shown in Figure 4a, with a warming of about
0.1°C per decade. However, since the beginning of the satellite
record in 1979, the temperature data from both satellites and
weather balloons show a warming in the global middle-to-lower
troposphere at a rate of approximately 0.05 + 0.10°C per
decade. The global average surface temperature has increased
significantly by 0.15 + 0.05°C/decade. The difference in the
warming rates is statistically significant. By contrast, during
the period 1958 to 1978, surface temperature trends were near
zero, while trends for the lowest 8 km of the atmosphere were
near 0.2°C/decade. About half of the observed difference in
warming since 1979 is likely* to be due to the combination of the
differences in spatial coverage of the surface and tropospheric
observations and the physical effects of the sequence of
volcanic eruptions and a substantial El Nifio (see Box 4 for a
general description of ENSO) that occurred within this period.
The remaining difference is very likely real and not an
observing bias. It arises primarily due to differences in the
rate of temperature change over the tropical and sub-tropical
regions, which were faster in the lowest 8 km of the atmosphere
before about 1979, but which have been slower since then.
There are no significant differences in warming rates over mid-
latitude continental regions in the Northern Hemisphere. In
the upper troposphere, no significant global temperature trends
have been detected since the early 1960s. In the stratosphere,
as shown in Figure 4b, both satellites and balloons show
substantial cooling, punctuated by sharp warming episodes of
one to two years long that are due to volcanic eruptions.

occurred during the last glacial and its deglaciation (between
about 100,000 and 10,000 years ago), particularly in high
latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. In a few places during
the deglaciation, local increases in temperature of 5 to 10°C
are likely to have occurred over periods as short as a few

A retreat of sea-ice extent in the Arctic spring and summer of
10 to 15% since the 1950s is consistent with an increase in
spring temperatures and, to a lesser extent, summer temperatures
in the high latitudes. There is little indication of reduced Arctic
sea-ice extent during winter when temperatures have increased
in the surrounding region. By contrast, there is no readily
apparent relationship between decadal changes of Antarctic
temperatures and sea-ice extent since 1973. After an initial
decrease in the mid-1970s, Antarctic sea-ice extent has
remained stable, or even slightly increased.

"The behaviour of ENSO (see Box 4 for a general description),
has been unusual since the mid-1970s compared with the
previous 100 years, with warm phase ENSO episodes being
relatively more frequent, persistent, and intense than the
opposite cool phase. This recent behaviour of ENSO is reflected
in variations in precipitation and temperature over much of
the global tropics and sub-tropics. The overall effect is likely
to have been a small contribution to the increase in global
temperatures during the last few decades. The Inter-decadal
Pacific Oscillation and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation are
associated with decadal to multidecadal climate variability over
the Pacific basin. It is likely that these oscillations modulate
ENSO-related climate variability.

"Based on tide gauge data, the rate of global mean sea level
rise during the 20th century is in the range 1.0 to 2.0 mm/yr,
with a central value of 1.5 mm/yr (the central value should
not be interpreted as a best estimate). (See Box 2 for the factors
that influence sea level.) As Figure 6 indicates, the longest
instrumental records (two or three centuries at most) of local
sea level come from tide gauges. Based on the very few long
tide-gauge records, the average rate of sea level rise has been
larger during the 20th century than during the 19th century.
No significant acceleration in the rate of sea level rise during
the 20th century has been detected. This is not inconsistent
with model results due to the possibility of compensating
factors and the limited data.

"Since the last glacial maximum about 20,000 years ago, the
sea level in locations far from present and former ice sheets
has risen by over 120 mas a result of loss of mass from these
ice sheets. Vertical land movements, both upward and downward,
are still occurring in response to these large transfers of mass
from ice sheets to oceans. The most rapid rise in global sea
level was between 15,000 and 6,000 years ago, with an average
rate of about 10 mm/yr. Based on geological data, eustatic sea
level (i.e., corresponding to a change in ocean volume) may
have risen at an average rate of 0.5 mm/yr over the past 6,000
years and at an average rate of 0.1 to 0.2 mm/yr over the last
3,000 years. This rate is about one tenth of that occurring during
the 20th century. Over the past 3,000 to 5,000 years,
oscillations in global sea level on time-scales of 100 to 1,000
years are unlikely to have exceeded 0.3 to 0.5 m.

"Decreasing snow cover and land-ice extent continue to be
positively correlated with increasing land-surface temperatures.
Satellite data show that there are very likely to have been
decreases of about 10% in the extent of snow cover since the
late 1960s. There is a highly significant correlation between
increases in Northern Hemisphere land temperatures and the
decreases. There is now ample evidence to support a major
retreat of alpine and continental glaciers in response to 20th
century warming. In a few maritime regions, increases in
precipitation due to regional atmospheric circulation changes
have overshadowed increases in temperature in the past two
decades, and glaciers have re-advanced. Over the past 100 to
150 years, ground-based observations show that there is very
likely to have been a reduction of about two weeks in the annual

"Firstly, as ocean water warms, it expands. On the basis of
observations of ocean temperatures and model results, thermal
expansion is believed to be one of the major contributors to
historical sea level changes. Further, thermal expansion is
expected to contribute the largest component to sea level rise
over the next hundred years. Deep ocean temperatures change
only slowly; therefore, thermal expansion would continue
for many centuries even if the atmospheric concentrations of
greenhouse gases were to stabilise.

"the main reason for the lower sea level during the last glacial
period was the amount of water stored in the large extension
of the ice sheets on the continents of the Northern
Hemisphere. After thermal expansion, the melting of
mountain glaciers and ice caps is expected to make the largest
contribution to the rise of sea level over the next hundred
years. These glaciers and ice caps make up only a few per
cent of the world’s land-ice area, but they are more sensitive
to climate change than the larger ice sheets in Greenland and
Antarctica, because the ice sheets are in colder climates with
low precipitation and low melting rates. Consequently, the
large ice sheets are expected to make only a small net
contribution to sea level change in the coming decades.

"Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is linked to the strength of the
westerlies over the Atlantic and extra-tropical Eurasia. During
winter the NAO displays irregular oscillations on interannual
to multi-decadal time-scales. Since the 1970s, the winter NAO
has often been in a phase that contributes to stronger westerlies,
which correlate with cold season warming over Eurasia. New
evidence indicates that the NAO and changes in Arctic sea ice
are likely to be closely coupled. The NAO is now believed to
be part of a wider scale atmospheric Arctic Oscillation that
affects much of the extratropical Northern Hemisphere. A
similar Antarctic Oscillation has been in an enhanced positive
phase during the last 15 years, with stronger westerlies over
the Southern Oceans.

"Sea level is also influenced by processes that are not explicitly
related to climate change. Terrestrial water storage (and
hence, sea level) can be altered by extraction of ground water,
building of reservoirs, changes in surface runoff, and seepage
into deep aquifers from reservoirs and irrigation. These
factors may be offsetting a significant fraction of the expected
acceleration in sea level rise from thermal expansion and
glacial melting. In addition, coastal subsidence in river delta
regions can also influence local sea level. Vertical land
movements caused by natural geological processes, such as
slow movements in the Earth’s mantle and tectonic
displacements of the crust, can have effects on local sea level
that are comparable to climate-related impacts. Lastly, on
seasonal, interannual, and decadal time-scales, sea level
responds to changes in atmospheric and ocean dynamics, with
the most striking example occurring during El Nifio events.

"events. The converse is also true. In some regions, however,
heavy and extreme events (i.e., defined to be within the upper
or lower ten percentiles) have increased despite the fact that
total precipitation has decreased or remained constant. This is
attributed to a decrease in the frequency of precipitation events.
Overall, it is likely that for many mid- and high latitude areas,
primarily in the Northern Hemisphere, statistically significant
increases have occurred in the proportion of total annual
precipitation derived from heavy and extreme precipitation
events; it is likely that there has been a 2 to 4% increase in the
frequency of heavy precipitation events over the latter half of
the 20th century. Over the 20th century (1900 to 1995), there
were relatively small increases in global land areas experiencing

airborne particles or droplets) and variations in solar activity,
both of which can alter the Earth’s radiation budget and hence

"A change in the energy available to the global Earth-

termed radiative forcing (Wm”) of the climate system (see
Box 1). Defined in this manner, radiative forcing of climate
change constitutes an index of the relative global mean impacts
on the surface-troposphere system due to different natural and
anthropogenic causes. This Section updates the knowledge of
the radiative forcing of climate change that has occurred from
pre-industrial times to the present. Figure 9 shows the estimated
radiative forcings from the beginning of the Industrial Era
(1750) to 1999 for the quantifiable natural and anthropogenic
forcing agents. Although not included in the figure due to their
episodic nature, volcanic eruptions are the source of another
important natural forcing. Summaries of the information about

"Like the record of past climate changes, the data sets for forcing
agents are of varying length and quality. Direct measurements
of solar irradiance exist for only about two decades. The
sustained direct monitoring of the atmospheric concentrations
of carbon dioxide (CO,) began about the middle of the 20th
century and, in later years, for other long-lived, well-mixed
gases such as methane. Palaeo-atmospheric data from ice cores
reveal the concentration changes occurring in earlier millennia
for some greenhouse gases. In contrast, the time-series
measurements for the forcing agents that have relatively short
residence times in the atmosphere (e.g., aerosols) are more
recent and are far less complete, because they are harder to
measure and are spatially heterogeneous. Current data sets
show the human influence on atmospheric concentrations of
both the long-lived greenhouse gases and short-lived forcing
agents during the last part of the past millennium. Figure 8
illustrates the effects of the large growth over the Industrial
Era in the anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and
sulphur dioxide, the latter being a precursor of aerosols.

"Surface temperature measurements over the land and
oceans (with two separate estimates over the latter) have
been measured and adjusted independently. All data sets
show quite similar upward trends globally, with two major
warming periods globally: 1910 to 1945 and since 1976.
There is an emerging tendency for global land-surface air
temperatures to warm faster than the global ocean-surface
temperatures.

Weather balloon measurements show that lower-
tropospheric temperatures have been increasing since 1958,
though only slightly since 1979. Since 1979, satellite data
are available and show similar trends to balloon data.
The decrease in the continental diurnal temperature range
coincides with increases in cloud amount, precipitation,
and increases in total water vapour.

The nearly worldwide decrease in mountain glacier extent
and ice mass is consistent with worldwide surface
temperature increases. A few recent exceptions in coastal
regions are consistent with atmospheric circulation
variations and related precipitation increases.

The decreases in snow cover and the shortening seasons
of lake and river ice relate well to increases in Northern
Hemispheric land-surface temperatures.

The systematic decrease in spring and summer sea-ice
extent and thickness in the Arctic is consistent with increases
in temperature over most of the adjacent land and ocean.
Ocean heat content has increased, and global average sea
level has risen.

The increases in total tropospheric water vapour in the
last 25 years are qualitatively consistent with increases in
tropospheric temperatures and an enhanced hydrologic
cycle, resulting in more extreme and heavier precipitation
events in many areas with increasing precipitation, e.g.,
middle and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.

"Table 1 provides examples of several greenhouse gases and

contribution of a species to radiative forcing of climate change
depends on the molecular radiative properties of the gas, the
size of the increase in atmospheric concentration, and the
residence time of the species in the atmosphere, once emitted.
The latter — the atmospheric residence time of the greenhouse
gas — is a highly policy relevant characteristic. Namely,
emissions of a greenhouse gas that has a long atmospheric
residence time is a quasi-irreversible commitment to sustained
radiative forcing over decades, centuries, or millennia, before
natural processes can remove the quantities emitted.

The rate of increase over the past century is unprecedented, at
least during the past 20,000 years (Figure 10). The CO, isotopic

demonstrates that the observed increase in CO, is predominately
due to the oxidation of organic carbon by fossil-fuel combustion

CO, concentrations (280 + 10 ppm) of the preceding several
thousand years, the increase during the Industrial Era is
dramatic. The average rate of increase since 1980 is 0.4%/yr.
The increase is a consequence of CO, emissions. Most of the

Figure 9: Global, annual-mean radiative forcings (Wm) due to a number of agents for the period from pre-industrial (1750) to present (late
1990s; about 2000) (numerical values are also listed in Table 6.11 of Chapter 6). For detailed explanations, see Chapter 6.13. The height of
the rectangular bar denotes a central or best estimate value, while its absence denotes no best estimate is possible. The vertical line about
the rectangular bar with “x” delimiters indicates an estimate of the uncertainty range, for the most part guided by the spread in the published
values of the forcing. A vertical line without a rectangular bar and with “o” delimiters denotes a forcing for which no central estimate can be
given owing to large uncertainties. The uncertainty range specified here has no statistical basis and therefore differs from the use of the term
elsewhere in this document. A “level of scientific understanding” index is accorded to each forcing, with high, medium, low and very low
levels, respectively. This represents the subjective judgement about the reliability of the forcing estimate, involving factors such as the
assumptions necessary to evaluate the forcing, the degree of knowledge of the physical/chemical mechanisms determining the forcing, and
the uncertainties surrounding the quantitative estimate of the forcing (see Table 6.12). The well-mixed greenhouse gases are grouped
together into a single rectangular bar with the individual mean contributions due to CO,, CH,, N,O and halocarbons shown (see Tables 6.1
and 6.11). Fossil fuel burning is separated into the “black carbon” and “organic carbon” components with its separate best estimate and range.
The sign of the effects due to mineral dust is itself an uncertainty. The indirect forcing due to tropospheric aerosols is poorly understood. The
same is true for the forcing due to aviation via its effects on contrails and cirrus clouds. Only the “first” type of indirect effect due to aerosols as
applicable in the context of liquid clouds is considered here. The “second” type of effect is conceptually important, but there exists very little
confidence in the simulated quantitative estimates. The forcing associated with stratospheric aerosols from volcanic eruptions is highly
variable over the period and is not considered for this plot (however, see Figure 6.8). All the forcings shown have distinct spatial and seasonal
features (Figure 6.7) such that the global, annual means appearing on this plot do not yield a complete picture of the radiative perturbation. They
are only intended to give, in a relative sense, a first-order perspective on a global, annual mean scale and cannot be readily employed to obtain
the climate response to the total natural and/or anthropogenic forcings. As in the SAR, it is emphasised that the positive and negative global
mean forcings cannot be added up and viewed a priorias providing offsets in terms of the complete global climate impact. [Based on Figure 6.6]

"Ozone (O,) is an important greenhouse gas present in both
the stratosphere and troposphere. The role of ozone in the
atmospheric radiation budget is strongly dependent on the altitude
at which changes in ozone concentrations occur. The changes
in ozone concentrations are also spatially variable. Further, ozone
is not a directly emitted species, but rather it is formed in the
atmosphere from photochemical processes involving both natural
and human-influenced precursor species. Once formed, the
residence time of ozone in the atmosphere is relatively short,
varying from weeks to months. As a result, estimation of ozone’s
radiative role is more complex and much less certain than for
the above long-lived and globally well-mixed greenhouse gases.

"The observed atmospheric concentrations of the substitutes for
the CFCs are increasing, and some of these compounds are

as a result of continuation of earlier uses and of their use as
substitutes for the CFCs. For example, the concentration of
HFC-23 has increased by more than a factor of three between
1978 and 1995. Because current concentrations are relatively
low, the present contribution of HFCs to radiative forcing is
relatively small. The present contribution of HCFCs to
radiative forcing is also relatively small, and future emissions
of these gases are limited by the Montreal Protocol.

"The global budget of nitrous oxide is in better balance than
in the SAR, but uncertainties in the emissions from individual
sources are still quite large. Natural sources of N,O are estimated
to be approximately 10 TgN/yr (1990), with soils being about
65% of the sources and oceans about 30%. New, higher estimates
of the emissions from anthropogenic sources (agriculture, biomass
burning, industrial activities, and livestock management) of
approximately 7 TgN/yr have brought the source/sink estimates
closer in balance, compared with the SAR. However, the
predictive understanding associated with this significant, long-
lived greenhouse gas has not improved significantly since the
last assessment. The radiative forcing is estimated at 0.15 Wm

"The atmospheric concentrations of many of those gases that
are both ozone-depleting and greenhouse gases are either
decreasing (CFC-11, CFC-113, CH,CCl; and CCl,) or
increasing more slowly (CFC-12) in response to reduced
emissions under the regulations of the Montreal Protocol and
its Amendments. Many of these halocarbons are also radiatively
effective, long-lived greenhouse gases. Halocarbons are carbon
compounds that contain fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine.
For most of these compounds, human activities are the sole source.
Halocarbons that contain chlorine (e.g., chlorofluorocarbons
— CFCs) and bromine (e.g., halons) cause depletion of the
stratospheric ozone layer and are controlled under the Montreal
Protocol. The combined tropospheric abundance of ozone-
depleting gases peaked in 1994 and is slowly declining. The
atmospheric abundances of some of the major greenhouse
halocarbons have peaked, as shown for CFC-11 in Figure 12.
The concentrations of CFCs and chlorocarbons in the

greenhouse gases; for example, decreases in methane and the
HFCs and increases in tropospheric ozone. Deposition of the
reaction products of NO, fertilises the biosphere, thereby
decreasing atmospheric CO,. While difficult to quantify,
increases in NO, that are projected to the year 2100 would

"Aerosols (very small airborne particles and droplets) are known
to influence significantly the radiative budget of the Earth/
atmosphere. Aerosol radiative effects occur in two distinct
ways: (i) the direct effect, whereby aerosols themselves scatter
and absorb solar and thermal infrared radiation, and (ii) the
indirect effect, whereby aerosols modify the microphysical
and hence the radiative properties and amount of clouds.
Aerosols are produced by a variety of processes, both natural
(including dust storms and volcanic activity) and anthropogenic
(including fossil fuel and biomass burning). The atmospheric
concentrations of tropospheric aerosols are thought to have
increased over recent years due to increased anthropogenic
emissions of particles and their precursor gases, hence giving
rise to radiative forcing. Most aerosols are found in the lower
troposphere (below a few kilometres), but the radiative effect
of many aerosols is sensitive to the vertical distribution.
Aerosols undergo chemical and physical changes while in the

"The global average radiative forcing due to increases in
tropospheric ozone since pre-industrial times is estimated to
have enhanced the anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing by
0.35 40.2 Wm. This makes tropospheric ozone the third most
important greenhouse gas after CO, and CH,. Ozone is formed
by photochemical reactions and its future change will be
determined by, among other things, emissions of CH, and
pollutants (as noted below). Ozone concentrations respond
relatively quickly to changes in the emissions of pollutants.
On the basis of limited observations and several modelling
studies, tropospheric ozone is estimated to have increased by
about 35% since the Pre-industrial Era, with some regions
experiencing larger and some with smaller increases. There
have been few observed increases in ozone concentrations in
the global troposphere since the mid- 1980s at most of the few
remote locations where it is regularly measured. The lack of
observed increase over North America and Europe is related
to the lack of a sustained increase in ozone-precursor emissions
from those continents. However, some Asian stations indicate a
possible rise in tropospheric ozone, which could be related to the
increase in East Asian emissions. As a result of more modelling
studies than before, there is now an increased confidence in
the estimates of tropospheric ozone forcing. The confidence,

"The observed losses of stratospheric ozone layer over the past
two decades have caused a negative forcing of 0.15 + 0.1
Wm” (i.e., a tendency toward cooling) of the surface
troposphere system. It was reported in Climate Change 1992:
The Supplementary Report to the IPCC Scientific Assessment,
that depletion of the ozone layer by anthropogenic halocarbons
introduces a negative radiative forcing. The estimate shown
in Figure 9 is slightly larger in magnitude than that given in
the SAR, owing to the ozone depletion that has continued over
the past five years, and it is more certain as a result of an
increased number of modelling studies. Studies with General
Circulation Models indicate that, despite the inhomogeneity
in ozone loss (i.e., lower stratosphere at high latitudes), such
anegative forcing does relate to a surface temperature decrease
in proportion to the magnitude of the negative forcing.
Therefore, this negative forcing over the past two decades has
offset some of the positive forcing that is occurring from the
long-lived and globally well-mixed greenhouse gases (Figure
9). A major source of uncertainty in the estimation of the
negative forcing is due to incomplete knowledge of ozone
depletion near the tropopause. Model calculations indicate that
increased penetration of ultraviolet radiation to the troposphere,
as a result of stratospheric ozone depletion, leads to enhanced
removal rates of gases like CH,, thus amplifying the negative
forcing due to ozone depletion. As the ozone layer recovers in
future decades because of the effects of the Montreal Protocol,
relative to the present, future radiative forcing associated with
stratospheric ozone is projected to become positive.

snow-covered forests with relatively low albedo to be replaced
with open, snow-covered areas with higher albedo. The estimate
given above is based on simulations in which pre-industrial

the level of understanding is very low for this forcing, and there

Because of this short residence time and the inhomogeneity
of sources, aerosols are distributed inhomogeneously in the
troposphere, with maxima near the sources. The radiative
forcing due to aerosols depends not only on these spatial
distributions, but also on the size, shape, and chemical
composition of the particles and various aspects (e.g., cloud
formation) of the hydrological cycle as well. As a result of all
of these factors, obtaining accurate estimates of this forcing

fundamental source of all energy in the Earth’s climate system

"Nevertheless, substantial progress has been achieved in better
defining the direct effect of a wider set of different aerosols.
The SAR considered the direct effects of only three anthropogenic
aerosol species: sulphate aerosols, biomass-burning aerosols,
and fossil fuel black carbon (or soot). Observations have now
shown the importance of organic materials in both fossil fuel
carbon aerosols and biomass-burning carbon aerosols. Since
the SAR, the inclusion of estimates for the abundance of fossil
fuel organic carbon aerosols has led to an increase in the
predicted total optical depth (and consequent negative forcing)
associated with industrial aerosols. Advances in observations
and in aerosol and radiative models have allowed quantitative
estimates of these separate components, as well as an estimate
for the range of radiative forcing associated with mineral dust,
as shown in Figure 9. Direct radiative forcing is estimated to
be -0.4 Wm? for sulphate, —0.2 Wm for biomass-burning
aerosols, —0.1 Wm for fossil fuel organic carbon, and +0.2
Wm for fossil fuel black carbon aerosols. Uncertainties
remain relatively large, however. These arise from difficulties
in determining the concentration and radiative characteristics
of atmospheric aerosols and the fraction of the aerosols that
are of anthropogenic origin, particularly the knowledge of the
sources of carbonaceous aerosols. This leads to considerable
differences (i.e., factor of two to three range) in the burden
and substantial differences in the vertical distribution (factor
of ten). Anthropogenic dust aerosol is also poorly quantified.
Satellite observations, combined with model calculations, are
enabling the identification of the spatial signature of the total
aerosol radiative effect in clear skies; however, the quantitative

CO, using an improved calculation of the CO, radiative

"A major feedback accounting for the large warming predicted
by climate models in response to an increase in CO, is the
increase in atmospheric water vapour. An increase in the
temperature of the atmosphere increases its water-holding
capacity; however, since most of the atmosphere is undersaturated,
this does not automatically mean that water vapour, itself, must
increase. Within the boundary layer (roughly the lowest | to 2
km of the atmosphere), water vapour increases with increasing
temperature. In the free troposphere above the boundary layer,
where the water vapour greenhouse effect is most important,
the situation is harder to quantify. Water vapour feedback, as
derived from current models, approximately doubles the
warming from what it would be for fixed water vapour. Since
the SAR, major improvements have occurred in the treatment
of water vapour in models, although detrainment of moisture
from clouds remains quite uncertain and discrepancies exist
between model water vapour distributions and those observed.
Models are capable of simulating the moist and very dry
regions observed in the tropics and sub-tropics and how they
evolve with the seasons and from year to year. While reassuring,
this does not provide a check of the feedbacks, although the

"Comprehensive climate models are based on physical laws

a three-dimensional grid over the globe. For climate
simulation, the major components of the climate system must
be represented in sub-models (atmosphere, ocean, land

that go on within and between them. Most results in this report
are derived from the results of models, which include some
representation of all these components. Global climate models
in which the atmosphere and ocean components have been
coupled together are also known as Atmosphere-Ocean
General Circulation Models (AOGCMs). In the atmospheric
module, for example, equations are solved that describe the
large-scale evolution of momentum, heat and moisture.
Similar equations are solved for the ocean. Currently, the
resolution of the atmospheric part of a typical model is about
250 km in the horizontal and about | km in the vertical above
the boundary layer. The resolution of a typical ocean model
is about 200 to 400 m in the vertical, with a horizontal
resolution of about 125 to 250 km. Equations are typically
solved for every half hour of a model integration. Many physical
processes, such as those related to clouds or ocean convection,
take place on much smaller spatial scales than the model grid
and therefore cannot be modelled and resolved explicitly.
Their average effects are approximately included in a simple
way by taking advantage of physically based relationships
with the larger-scale variables. This technique is known as

important because it reflects more incoming solar radiation

of sea ice gives a positive feedback on climate warming at
high latitudes. Furthermore, because sea ice contains less salt

as well as changing preference of specific climate regimes, as
evidenced by the observed trend toward positive values for
the last 30 years in the NAO index and the climate “shift” in
the tropical Pacific about 1976. While coupled models simulate
features of observed natural climate variability, such as the
NAO and ENSO, which suggests that many of the relevant
processes are included in the models, further progress is needed
to depict these natural modes accurately. Moreover, because
ENSO and NAO are key determinants of regional climate
change and can possibly result in abrupt and counter intuitive
changes, there has been an increase in uncertainty in those
aspects of climate change that critically depend on regional

"There is an increasing realisation that natural circulation
patterns, such as ENSO and NAO, play a fundamental role in
global climate and its interannual and longer-term variability.
The strongest natural fluctuation of climate on interannual
time-scales is the ENSO phenomenon (see Box 4). It is an
inherently coupled atmosphere-ocean mode with its core
activity in the tropical Pacific, but with important regional
climate impacts throughout the world. Global climate models
are only now beginning to exhibit variability in the tropical
Pacific that resembles ENSO, mainly through increased
meridional resolution at the equator. Patterns of sea surface
temperature and atmospheric circulation similar to those
occurring during ENSO on interannual time-scales also occur
on decadal and longer time-scales.

mechanisms, for example, land management, CO, fertilisation
(the enhancement of plant growth as a result of increased
atmospheric CO, concentration) and increasing anthropogenic
inputs of nitrogen. This uptake is limited by the relatively small
fraction of plant carbon that can enter long-term storage (wood
and humus). The fraction of emitted CO, that can be taken up
by the oceans and land is expected to decline with increasing
CO, concentrations. Process-based models of the ocean and land
carbon cycles (including representations of physical, chemical
and biological processes) have been developed and evaluated
against measurements pertinent to the natural carbon cycle. Such
models have also been set up to mimic the human perturbation
of the carbon cycle and have been able to generate time-series
of ocean and land carbon uptake that are broadly consistent
with observed global trends. There are still substantial differences
among models, especially in how they treat the physical ocean
circulation and in regional responses of terrestrial ecosystem
processes to climate. Nevertheless, current models consistently
indicate that when the effects of climate change are considered,
CO, uptake by oceans and land becomes smaller.

"The thermohaline circulation (THC) is responsible for the
major part of the meridional heat transport in the Atlantic
Ocean. The THC is a global-scale overturning in the ocean driven
by density differences arising from temperature and salinity
effects. In the Atlantic, heat is transported by warm surface
waters flowing northward and cold saline waters from the North
Atlantic returning at depth. Reorganisations in the Atlantic
THC can be triggered by perturbations in the surface buoyancy,
which is influenced by precipitation, evaporation, continental
runoff, sea-ice formation, and the exchange of heat, processes
that could all change with consequences for regional and global
climate. Interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean
are also likely to be of considerable importance on decadal
and longer time-scales, where the THC is involved. The interplay
between the large-scale atmospheric forcing, with warming
and evaporation in low latitudes and cooling and increased
precipitation at high latitudes, forms the basis of a potential
instability of the present Atlantic THC. ENSO may also
influence the Atlantic THC by altering the fresh water balance
of the tropical Atlantic, therefore providing a coupling between
low and high latitudes. Uncertainties in the representation of
small-scale flows over sills and through narrow straits and of
ocean convection limit the ability of models to simulate
situations involving substantial changes in the THC. The less
saline North Pacific means that a deep THC does not occur in
the Pacific.

0.25 m, as warm waters surge eastward along the equator.
However, the changes in atmospheric circulation are not

projections of future climates. These models cannot yet simulate
all aspects of climate (e.g., they still cannot account fully for
the observed trend in the surface-troposphere temperature

sources of significant uncertainty, but there have been
incremental improvements in simulations of these quantities.

without flux adjustment have come from improvements in both
the atmospheric and oceanic components. In the model
atmosphere, improvements in convection, the boundary layer,
clouds, and surface latent heat fluxes are most notable. In the
model ocean, the improvements are in resolution, boundary

"Detection is the process of demonstrating that an observed
change is significantly different (in a statistical sense) than
can be explained by natural variability. Attribution is the
process of establishing cause and effect with some defined
level of confidence, including the assessment of competing
hypotheses. The response to anthropogenic changes in climate
forcing occurs against a backdrop of natural internal and
externally forced climate variability. Internal climate
variability, i.e., climate variability not forced by external
agents, occurs on all time-scales from weeks to centuries and
even millennia. Slow climate components, such as the ocean,
have particularly important roles on decadal and century time-
scales because they integrate weather variability. Thus, the
climate is capable of producing long time-scale variations of
considerable magnitude without external influences. Externally
forced climate variations (signals) may be due to changes in
natural forcing factors, such as solar radiation or volcanic
aerosols, or to changes in anthropogenic forcing factors, such
as increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases or aerosols.
The presence of this natural climate variability means that the
detection and attribution of anthropogenic climate change is a
statistical “signal to noise” problem. Detection studies
demonstrate whether or not an observed change is highly
unusual in a statistical sense, but this does not necessarily imply
that we understand its causes. The attribution of climate change
to anthropogenic causes involves statistical analysis and the
careful assessment of multiple lines of evidence to demonstrate,

and in the frequency of major volcanic eruptions. These limitations
leave few alternatives to using long “control” simulations with

Since the SAR, more models have been used to estimate the
magnitude of internal climate variability, a representative
sample of which is given in Figure 14. As can be seen, there is
a wide range of global scale internal variability in these models.
Estimates of the longer time-scale variability relevant to
detection and attribution studies is uncertain, but, on
interannual and decadal time-scales, some models show similar
or larger variability than observed, even though models do
not include variance from external sources. Conclusions on
detection of an anthropogenic signal are insensitive to the
model used to estimate internal variability, and recent changes
cannot be accounted for as pure internal variability, even if
the amplitude of simulated internal variations is increased by
a factor of two or perhaps more. Most recent detection and
attribution studies find no evidence that model-estimated
internal variability at the surface is inconsistent with the
residual variability that remains in the observations after
removal of the estimated anthropogenic signals on the large
spatial and long time-scales used in detection and attribution
studies. Note, however, the ability to detect inconsistencies is

increased rigour in the assessment of the role of anthropogenic
forcing in climate, and the robustness of results to the assumptions
made using those techniques, has increased the confidence in
these aspects of detection and attribution.

"The detection and attribution methods used should not be
sensitive to errors in the amplitude of the global mean response
to individual forcings. In the signal-estimation methods used
in this report, the amplitude of the signal is estimated from the
observations and not the amplitude of the simulated response.
Hence the estimates are independent of those factors determining
the simulated amplitude of the response, such as the climate
sensitivity of the model used. In addition, if the signal due to
a given forcing is estimated individually, the amplitude is
largely independent of the magnitude of the forcing used to
derive the response. Uncertainty in the amplitude of the solar
and indirect sulphate aerosol forcing should not affect the
magnitude of the estimated signal.

"Uncertainties in other forcings that have been included do not
prevent identification of the effect of anthropogenic greenhouse
gases over the last 50 years. The sulphate forcing, while
uncertain, is negative over this period. Changes in natural forcing
during most of this period are also estimated to be negative.
Detection of the influence of anthropogenic greenhouse gases
therefore cannot be eliminated either by the uncertainty in
sulphate aerosol forcing or because natural forcing has not
been included in all model simulations. Studies that distinguish
the separate responses to greenhouse gas, sulphate aerosol and
natural forcing produce uncertain estimates of the amplitude
of the sulphate aerosol and natural signals, but almost all
studies are nevertheless able to detect the presence of the
anthropogenic greenhouse gas signal in the recent climate record.

"Most attribution studies find that, over the last 50 years, the
estimated rate and magnitude of global warming due to
increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases alone are
comparable with or larger than the observed warming.
Attribution studies address the question of “whether the
magnitude of the simulated response to a particular forcing
agent is consistent with observations”. The use of multi-signal
techniques has enabled studies that discriminate between the
effects of different factors on climate. The inclusion of the
time dependence of signals has helped to distinguish between
natural and anthropogenic forcings. As more response patterns
are included, the problem of degeneracy (different combinations
of patterns yielding near identical fits to the observations)
inevitably arises. Nevertheless, even with all the major responses
that have been included in the analysis, a distinct greenhouse
gas signal remains detectable. Furthermore, most model estimates
that take into account both greenhouse gases and sulphate
aerosols are consistent with observations over this period. The
best agreement between model simulations and observations
over the last 140 years is found when both anthropogenic and
natural factors are included (see Figure 15). These results show

Figure 16: (a) Estimates of the “scaling factors” by which the amplitude of several model-simulated signals must be multiplied to reproduce
the corresponding changes in the observed record. The vertical bars indicate the 5 to 95% uncertainty range due to internal variability. A
range encompassing unity implies that this combination of forcing amplitude and model-simulated response is consistent with the corresponding
observed change, while a range encompassing zero implies that this model-simulated signal is not detectable. Signals are defined as the
ensemble mean response to external forcing expressed in large-scale (>5,000 km) near-surface temperatures over the 1946 to 1996 period
relative to the 1896 to 1996 mean. The first entry (G) shows the scaling factor and 5 to 95% confidence interval obtained with the assumption
that the observations consist only of a response to greenhouse gases plus internal variability. The range is significantly less than one
(consistent with results from other models), meaning that models forced with greenhouse gases alone significantly over predict the observed
warming signal. The next eight entries show scaling factors for model-simulated responses to greenhouse and sulphate forcing (GS), with
two cases including indirect sulphate and tropospheric ozone forcing, one of these also including stratospheric ozone depletion (GSI and
GSIO, respectively). All but one (CGCM1) of these ranges is consistent with unity. Hence there is little evidence that models are systematically
over- or under-predicting the amplitude of the observed response under the assumption that model-simulated GS signals and internal
variability are an adequate representation (i.e., that natural forcing has had little net impact on this diagnostic). Observed residual variability
is consistent with this assumption in all but one case (ECHAMS, indicated by the asterisk). One is obliged to make this assumption to include
models for which only a simulation of the anthropogenic response is available, but uncertainty estimates in these single signal cases are
incomplete since they do not account for uncertainty in the naturally forced response. These ranges indicate, however, the high level of
confidence with which internal variability, as simulated by these various models, can be rejected as an explanation of recent near-surface
temperature change. A more complete uncertainty analysis is provided by the next three entries, which show corresponding scaling factors
on individual greenhouse (G), sulphate (S), solar-plus-volcanic (N), solar-only (So) and volcanic-only (V) signals for those cases in which the
relevant simulations have been performed. In these cases, multiple factors are estimated simultaneously to account for uncertainty in the
amplitude of the naturally forced response. The uncertainties increase but the greenhouse signal remains consistently detectable. In one
case (ECHAMS) the model appears to be overestimating the greenhouse response (scaling range in the G signal inconsistent with unity), but
this result is sensitive to which component of the control is used to define the detection space. It is also not known how it would respond to
the inclusion of a volcanic signal. In cases where both solar and volcanic forcing is included (HadCM2 and HadCM89), G and S signals remain
detectable and consistent with unity independent of whether natural signals are estimated jointly or separately (allowing for different errors
in S and V responses). (b) Estimated contributions to global mean warming over the 20th century, based on the results shown in (a), with 5
to 95% confidence intervals. Although the estimates vary depending on which model’s signal and what forcing is assumed, and are less
certain if more than one signal is estimated, all show a significant contribution from anthropogenic climate change to 20th century warming.

available in time for this Third Assessment Report. However,
draft scenarios were released to climate modellers earlier to
facilitate their input to the Third Assessment Report, in
accordance with a decision of the IPCC Bureau in 1998. At
that time, one marker scenario was chosen from each of four
of the scenario groups based directly on the storylines (A1B,
A2, B1, and B2). The choice of the markers was based on
which of the initial quantifications best reflected the storyline
and features of specific models. Marker scenarios are no more

illustrative of a particular storyline. Scenarios were also
selected later to illustrate the other two scenario groups (A1FI

"In 1996, the IPCC began the development of a new set of
emissions scenarios, effectively to update and replace the well-
known IS92 scenarios. The approved new set of scenarios is
described in the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios
(SRES). Four different narrative storylines were developed to
describe consistently the relationships between the forces driving
emissions and their evolution and to add context for the scenario
quantification. The resulting set of 40 scenarios (35 of which
contain data on the full range of gases required to force climate
models) cover a wide range of the main demographic, economic
and technological driving forces of future greenhouse gas and
sulphur emissions. Each scenario represents a specific
quantification of one of the four storylines. All the scenarios
based on the same storyline constitute a scenario “family” (See
Box 5, which briefly describes the main characteristics of the
four SRES storylines and scenario families). The SRES
scenarios do not include additional climate initiatives, which
means that no scenarios are included that explicitly assume
implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change or the emissions targets of the Kyoto
Protocol. However, greenhouse gas emissions are directly
affected by non-climate change policies designed for a wide
range of other purposes (e.g., air quality). Furthermore,
government policies can, to varying degrees, influence the
greenhouse gas emission drivers, such as demographic change,
social and economic development, technological change,
resource use, and pollution management. This influence is
broadly reflected in the storylines and resulting scenarios.

Large uncertainties in estimates of internal climate
variability from models and observations. Although as
noted above, these are unlikely (bordering on very unlikely)
to be large enough to nullify the claim that a detectable
climate change has taken place.

Considerable uncertainty in the reconstructions of solar
and volcanic forcing which are based on proxy or limited
observational data for all but the last two decades.
Detection of the influence of greenhouse gases on climate
appears to be robust to possible amplification of the solar
forcing by ozone-solar or solar-cloud interactions, provided
these do not alter the pattern or time-dependence of the
response to solar forcing. Amplification of the solar signal
by these processes, which are not yet included in models,
remains speculative.

Large uncertainties in anthropogenic forcing are
associated with the effects of aerosols. The effects of some
anthropogenic factors, including organic carbon, black
carbon, biomass aerosols, and changes in land use, have
not been included in detection and attribution studies.
Estimates of the size and geographic pattern of the effects
of these forcings vary considerably, although individually
their global effects are estimated to be relatively small.
Large differences in the response of different models to
the same forcing. These differences, which are often greater
than the difference in response in the same model with
and without aerosol effects, highlight the large uncertainties
in climate change prediction and the need to quantify
uncertainty and reduce it through better observational data
sets and model improvement.

in minor ways from the draft scenarios used for the AOGCM

from the draft and marker scenarios are very similar. The
primary difference is a change to the standardised values for
1990 to 2000, which is common to all these scenarios. This
results in a higher forcing early in the period. There are further
small differences in net forcing, but these decrease until, by

the possibility of either increases or decreases in anthropogenic

considered in this report: the first scales the emissions of fossil

the emissions with SO, and deforestation. Only the second

evident that the range for the new SRES scenarios is shifted
higher compared to the IS92 scenarios. This is mainly due to
the reduced future SO, emissions of the SRES scenarios

CO,-increase experiments, which have no sulphate aerosol,
and the SRES experiments is the regional moderating of the
warming over industrialised areas, in the SRES experiments,

scenarios over the coming decades, errors in large-scale
temperature projections are likely to increase in proportion to
the magnitude of the overall response. The estimated size of
and uncertainty in current observed warming rates attributable
to human influence thus provides a relatively model-independent
estimate of uncertainty in multi-decade projections under most
scenarios. To be consistent with recent observations,
anthropogenic warming is likely to lie in the range 0.1 to 0.2°C/
decade over the next few decades under the IS92a scenario.
This is similar to the range of responses to this scenario based

Confidence in projections of changes in future frequency,
amplitude, and spatial pattern of El Nifio events in the tropical
Pacific is tempered by some shortcomings in how well El Nifio
is simulated in complex models. Current projections show little
change or a small increase in amplitude for El Nifio events
over the next 100 years. However, even with little or no change
in El Nifio amplitude, global warming is likely to lead to greater
extremes of drying and heavy rainfall and increase the risk of
droughts and floods that occur with El Nifio events in many
regions. It also is likely that warming associated with increasing
greenhouse gas concentrations will cause an increase of Asian
summer monsoon precipitation variability. Changes in monsoon
mean duration and strength depend on the details of the emission
scenario. The confidence in such projections is limited by how
well the climate models simulate the detailed seasonal
evolution of the monsoons. There is no clear agreement on
changes in frequency or structure of naturally occurring modes
of variability, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation, i.e., the
magnitude and character of the changes vary across the models.

to eventually drop well below current levels. Anthropogenic
CO, emission rates that arrive at stable CO, concentration
levels from 450 to 1,000 ppm were deduced from the
prescribed CO, profiles (Figure 25a). The results (Figure 25b)
are not substantially different from those presented in the SAR;
however, the range is larger, mainly due to the range of future
terrestrial carbon uptake caused by different assumptions in
the models. Stabilisation at 450, 650 or 1,000 ppm would require
global anthropogenic emissions to drop below 1990 levels
within a few decades, about a century, or about two centuries,
respectively, and continue to steadily decrease thereafter.
Although there is sufficient uptake capacity in the ocean to
incorporate 70 to 80% of foreseeable anthropogenic CO,
emissions to the atmosphere, this process takes centuries due
to the rate of ocean mixing. As a result, even several centuries
after emissions occurred, about a quarter of the increase in
concentration caused by these emissions is still present in the
atmosphere. To maintain constant CO, concentration beyond
2300 requires emissions to drop to match the rate of carbon
sinks at that time. Natural land and ocean sinks with the
capacity to persist for hundreds or thousands of years are small

are generally greater than globally averaged temperatures by
a factor of 1.2 to 3.1 for the range of models used in Chapter
11. For a warming over Greenland of 5.5°C, consistent with
mid-range stabilisation scenarios (see Figure 26), the Greenland
ice sheet is likely to contribute about 3 m in 1,000 years. For
a warming of 8°C, the contribution is about 6 m, the ice sheet
being largely eliminated. For smaller warmings, the decay of
the ice sheet would be substantially slower (see Figure 27).

"Current ice dynamic models project that the West Antarctic
ice sheet (WAIS) will contribute no more than 3 mm/yr to sea
level rise over the next thousand years, even if significant
changes were to occur in the ice shelves. Such results are
strongly dependent on model assumptions regarding climate
change scenarios, ice dynamics and other factors. Apart from
the possibility of an internal ice dynamic instability, surface
melting will affect the long-term viability of the Antarctic ice
sheet. For warmings of more than 10°C, simple runoff models
predict that a zone of net mass loss would develop on the ice
sheet surface. Irreversible disintegration of the WAIS would
result because the WAIS cannot retreat to higher ground once
its margins are subjected to surface melting and begin to recede.
Such a disintegration would take at least a few millennia.
Thresholds for total disintegration of the East Antarctic ice
sheet by surface melting involve warmings above 20°C, a
situation that has not occurred for at least 15 million years
and which is far more than predicted by any scenario of climate
change currently under consideration.

' Climate change in IPCC usage refers to any change in climate over time,
whether due to natural variability or as a result of human activity. This
usage differs from that in the Framework Convention on Climate Change,
where climate change refers to a change of climate that is attributed directly
or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global
atmosphere and that is in addition to natural climate variability observed
over comparable time periods. Attribution of climate change to natural
forcing and human activities has been addressed by Working Group I.

? The report has been written by 183 Coordinating Lead Authors and Lead
Authors, and 243 Contributing Authors. It was reviewed by 440 government
and expert reviewers, and 33 Review Editors oversaw the review process.

Session of Working Group II in Geneva on 13-16 February 2001.

"Available observational evidence indicates that regional
changes in climate, particularly increases in temperature, have
already affected a diverse set of physical and biological systems
in many parts of the world. Examples of observed changes
include shrinkage of glaciers, thawing of permafrost, later
freezing and earlier break-up of ice on rivers and lakes,
lengthening of mid- to high-latitude growing seasons, poleward
and altitudinal shifts of plant and animal ranges, declines of
some plant and animal populations, and earlier flowering of
trees, emergence of insects, and egg-laying in birds (see Figure
SPM-1). Associations between changes in regional temperatures
and observed changes in physical and biological systems have
been documented in many aquatic, terrestrial, and marine
environments. [2.1, 4.3, 4.4, 5.7, and 7.1]
"	Text
"The studies mentioned above and illustrated in Figure SPM-1
were drawn from a literature survey, which identified long-term
studies, typically 20 years or more, of changes in biological
and physical systems that could be correlated with regional
changes in temperature.° In most cases where changes in
biological and physical systems were detected, the direction
of change was that expected on the basis of known mechanisms.
The probability that the observed changes in the expected
direction (with no reference to magnitude) could occur by
chance alone is negligible. In many parts of the world,
precipitation-related impacts may be important. At present,
there is a lack of systematic concurrent climatic and biophysical
data of sufficient length (2 or more decades) that are considered
necessary for assessment of precipitation impacts.
"	Text
"Observed changes in climate, their causes, and potential future
changes are assessed in the report of Working Group I of the
IPCC, Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis. The Working
Group I report concludes, inter alia, that the globally averaged
surface temperatures have increased by 0.6 + 0.2°C over the
20th century; and that, for the range of scenarios developed in
the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES), the
globally averaged surface air temperature is projected by
models to warm 1.4 to 5.8°C by 2100 relative to 1990, and
globally averaged sea level is projected by models to rise 0.09
to 0.88 m by 2100. These projections indicate that the warming
would vary by region, and be accompanied by increases and
decreases in precipitation. In addition, there would be changes
in the variability of climate, and changes in the frequency and
intensity of some extreme climate phenomena. These general
features of climate change act on natural and human systems
and they set the context for the Working Group II assessment.
The available literature has not yet investigated climate change
impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability associated with the
upper end of the projected range of warming.

gauge the level of scientific understanding is used: well established,
established-but-incomplete, competing explanations, and speculative.

"Factors such as land-use change and pollution also act on these
physical and biological systems, making it difficult to attribute
changes to particular causes in some specific cases. However,
taken together, the observed changes in these systems are
consistent in direction and coherent across diverse localities
and/or regions (see Figure SPM-1) with the expected effects
of regional changes in temperature. Thus, from the collective
evidence, there is high confidence’ that recent regional changes
in temperature have had discernible impacts on many physical

Figure SPM-2: Reasons for concern about projected climate change impacts. The risks of adverse impacts from climate change increase
with the magnitude of climate change. The left part of the figure displays the observed temperature increase relative to 1990 and the range of
projected temperature increase after 1990 as estimated by Working Group | of the IPCC for scenarios from the Special Report on Emissions
Scenarios. The right panel displays conceptualizations of five reasons for concern regarding climate change risks evolving through 2100.
White indicates neutral or small negative or positive impacts or risks, yellow indicates negative impacts for some systems or low risks, and
red means negative impacts or risks that are more widespread and/or greater in magnitude. The assessment of impacts or risks takes into
account only the magnitude of change and not the rate of change. Global mean annual temperature change is used in the figure as a proxy
for the magnitude of climate change, but projected impacts will be a function of, among other factors, the magnitude and rate of global and
regional changes in mean climate, climate variability and extreme climate phenomena, social and economic conditions, and adaptation.

avalanches, and windstorms. While there are uncertainties
attached to estimates of such changes, some extreme events
are projected to increase in frequency and/or severity during
the 21st century due to changes in the mean and/or variability
of climate, so it can be expected that the severity of their impacts
will also increase in concert with global warming (see Figure

"If these changes in Earth systems were to occur, their impacts
would be widespread and sustained. For example, significant
slowing of the oceanic thermohaline circulation would impact
deep-water oxygen levels and carbon uptake by oceans and
marine ecosystems, and would reduce warming over parts of
Europe. Disintegration of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet or
melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet could raise global sea level
up to 3 m each over the next 1,000 years®, submerge many
islands, and inundate extensive coastal areas. Depending on
the rate of ice loss, the rate and magnitude of sea-level rise
could greatly exceed the capacity of human and natural systems
to adapt without substantial impacts. Releases of terrestrial
carbon from permafrost regions and methane from hydrates
in coastal sediments, induced by warming, would further
increase greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere and
amplify climate change. [3.5, 5.7, and 7.2.5]

"Benefits and costs of climate change effects have been
estimated in monetary units and aggregated to national,
regional, and global scales. These estimates generally exclude
the effects of changes in climate variability and extremes, do
not account for the effects of different rates of change, and
only partially account for impacts on goods and services that
are not traded in markets. These omissions are likely to result
in underestimates of economic losses and overestimates of
economic gains. Estimates of aggregate impacts are controversial
because they treat gains for some as canceling out losses for
others and because the weights that are used to aggregate across
individuals are necessarily subjective. [7.2.2 and 7.2.3]

"Experience with adaptation to climate variability and extremes
can be drawn upon to develop appropriate strategies for
adapting to anticipated climate change. Adaptation to current
climate variability and extremes often produces benefits as
well as forming a basis for coping with future climate change.
However, experience also demonstrates that there are constraints
to achieving the full measure of potential adaptation. In
addition, maladaptation, such as promoting development in
risk-prone locations, can occur due to decisions based on short-
term considerations, neglect of known climatic variability,
imperfect foresight, insufficient information, and over-reliance
on insurance mechanisms. [6]

"Further, when aggregated to a global scale, world gross domestic
product (GDP) would change by + a few percent for global
mean temperature increases of up to a few °C (low confidence),
and increasing net losses would result for larger increases in
temperature (medium confidence’) (see Figure SPM-2). More
people are projected to be harmed than benefited by climate
change, even for global mean temperature increases of less
than a few °C (low confidence’®). These results are sensitive to
assumptions about changes in regional climate, level of
development, adaptive capacity, rate of change, the valuation
of impacts, and the methods used for aggregating monetary
losses and gains, including the choice of discount rate. [7.2.2]

"The ability of human systems to adapt to and cope with climate

education, information, skills, infrastructure, access to
resources, and management capabilities. There is potential for
developed and developing countries to enhance and/or acquire
adaptive capabilities. Populations and communities are highly
variable in their endowments with these attributes, and the
developing countries, particularly the least developed
countries, are generally poorest in this regard. As a result, they
have lesser capacity to adapt and are more vulnerable to climate
change damages, just as they are more vulnerable to other
stresses. This condition is most extreme among the poorest
people. [6.1; see also 5.1.7, 5.2.7, 5.3.5, 5.4.6, 5.6.1, 5.6.2,

"Demand for water is generally increasing due to population
growth and economic development, but is falling in some
countries because of increased efficiency of use. Climate
change is unlikely to have a big effect on municipal and
industrial water demands in general, but may substantially
affect irrigation withdrawals, which depend on how increases in
evaporation are offset or exaggerated by changes in precipitation.
Higher temperatures, hence higher crop evaporative demand,
mean that the general tendency would be towards an increase
in irrigation demands. [4.1]

"Water resource management techniques, particularly those of
integrated water resource management, can be applied to adapt
to hydrologic effects of climate change, and to additional
uncertainty, so as to lessen vulnerabilities. Currently, supply-
side approaches (e.g., increasing flood defenses, building
weirs, utilizing water storage areas, including natural systems,
improving infrastructure for water collection and distribution)
are more widely used than demand-side approaches (which alter
the exposure to stress); the latter is the focus of increasing attention.
However, the capacity to implement effective management
responses is unevenly distributed around the world and is low

depending on the rate of population growth. The projected
climate change could further decrease the streamflow and
groundwater recharge in many of these water-stressed
countries—for example in central Asia, southern Africa, and
countries around the Mediterranean Sea—but may increase it
in some others. [4.1; see also 5.1.1, 5.2.3, 5.3.1, 5.4.1, 5.5.1,

CO,, air temperature, water stress, mineral nutrition, air quality,
and adaptive responses. Even though increased CO,
concentration can stimulate crop growth and yield, that benefit
may not always overcome the adverse effects of excessive
heat and drought (medium confidence’). These advances, along

"could exacerbate such events. Streamflow during seasonal low
flow periods would decrease in many areas due to greater
evaporation; changes in precipitation may exacerbate or offset
the effects of increased evaporation. The projected climate
change would degrade water quality through higher water
temperatures and increased pollutant load from runoff and
overflows of waste facilities. Quality would be degraded further
where flows decrease, but increases in flows may mitigate to
acertain extent some degradations in water quality by increasing
dilution. Where snowfall is currently an important component
of the water balance, a greater proportion of winter precipitation
may fall as rain, and this can result in a more intense peak
streamflow which in addition would move from spring to
winter. [4.1]

"The effect of climate change on streamflow and groundwater
recharge varies regionally and between climate scenarios,
largely following projected changes in precipitation. A
consistent projection across most climate change scenarios is
for increases in annual mean streamflow in high latitudes and
southeast Asia, and decreases in central Asia, the area around
the Mediterranean, southern Africa, and Australia (medium
confidence’) (see Figure SPM-3); the amount of change,
however, varies between scenarios. For other areas, including
mid-latitudes, there is no strong consistency in projections of
streamflow, partly because of differences in projected rainfall
and partly because of differences in projected evaporation,
which can offset rainfall increases. The retreat of most glaciers
is projected to accelerate, and many small glaciers may
disappear (high confidence’). In general, the projected changes
in average annual runoff are less robust than impacts based
solely on temperature change because precipitation changes
vary more between scenarios. At the catchment scale, the effect
of a given change in climate varies with physical properties
and vegetation of catchments, and may be in addition to land-

Figure SPM-3: Projected changes in average annual water runoff by 2050, relative to average runoff for 1961-1990, largely follow projected
changes in precipitation. Changes in runoff are calculated with a hydrologic model using as inputs climate projections from two versions of
the Hadley Centre atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) for a scenario of 1% per annum increase in effective carbon
dioxide concentration in the atmosphere: (a) HadCM2 ensemble mean and (b) HadCM8&. Projected increases in runoff in high latitudes and
southeast Asia, and decreases in central Asia, the area around the Mediterranean, southern Africa, and Australia are broadly consistent
across the Hadley Centre experiments, and with the precipitation projections of other AOGCM experiments. For other areas of the world,
changes in precipitation and runoff are scenario- and model-dependent.

increases of a few °C or greater would prompt food prices to
increase due to a slowing in the expansion of global food
supply relative to growth in global food demand (established,

°C, economic models do not clearly distinguish the climate
change signal from other sources of change based on those
studies included in this assessment. Some recent aggregated
studies have estimated economic impacts on vulnerable
populations such as smallholder producers and poor urban

incomes of the vulnerable populations and increase the absolute
number of people at risk of hunger, though this is uncertain and
requires further research. It is established, though incompletely,
that climate change, mainly through increased extremes and
temporal/spatial shifts, will worsen food security in Africa. [4.2]

Adaptive Capacity, Vulnerability, and Key Concerns

 

Africa

e Adaptive capacity of human systems in Africa is low due to lack of economic resources and technology, and
vulnerability high as a result of heavy reliance on rain-fed agriculture, frequent droughts and floods, and
poverty. [5.1.7]

* Grain yields are projected to decrease for many scenarios, diminishing food security, particularly in small
food-importing countries (medium to high confidence’). [5.1.2]

* Major rivers of Africa are highly sensitive to climate variation; average runoff and water availability would
decrease in Mediterranean and southern countries of Africa (medium confidence’). [5.1.1]

° Extension of ranges of infectious disease vectors would adversely affect human health in Africa (medium
confidence’). [5.1.4]

° Desertification would be exacerbated by reductions in average annual rainfall, runoff, and soil moisture,
especially in southern, North, and West Africa (medium confidence’). [5.1.6]

Increases in droughts, floods, and other extreme events would add to stresses on water resources, food security,
human health, and infrastructures, and would constrain development in Africa (high confidence’). [5.1]

¢ Significant extinctions of plant and animal species are projected and would impact rural livelihoods, tourism,
and genetic resources (medium confidence’). [5.1.3]

* Coastal settlements in, for example, the Gulf of Guinea, Senegal, Gambia, Egypt, and along the East-Southern
African coast would be adversely impacted by sea-level rise through inundation and coastal erosion (high
confidence’). [5.1.5]

 

Asia

e Adaptive capacity of human systems is low and vulnerability is high in the developing countries of Asia; the
developed countries of Asia are more able to adapt and less vulnerable. [5.2.7]

° Extreme events have increased in temperate and tropical Asia, including floods, droughts, forest fires, and
tropical cyclones (high confidence’). [5.2.4]

¢ Decreases in agricultural productivity and aquaculture due to thermal and water stress, sea-level rise, floods and
droughts, and tropical cyclones would diminish food security in many countries of arid, tropical, and temperate
Asia; agriculture would expand and increase in productivity in northern areas (medium confidence’). [5.2.1]

° Runoff and water availability may decrease in arid and semi-arid Asia but increase in northern Asia (medium
confidence’). [5.2.3]

¢ Human health would be threatened by possible increased exposure to vector-borne infectious diseases and
heat stress in parts of Asia (medium confidence’). [5.2.6]

° Sea-level rise and an increase in the intensity of tropical cyclones would displace tens of millions of people in
low-lying coastal areas of temperate and tropical Asia; increased intensity of rainfall would increase flood
risks in temperate and tropical Asia (high confidence’). [5.2.5 and Table TS-8]

* Climate change would increase energy demand, decrease tourism attraction, and influence transportation in
some regions of Asia (medium confidence’). [5.2.4 and 5.2.7]

* Climate change would exacerbate threats to biodiversity due to land-use and land-cover change and population
pressure in Asia (medium confidence®). Sea-level rise would put ecological security at risk, including mangroves
and coral reefs (high confidence’). [5.2.2]

° Poleward movement of the southern boundary of the permafrost zones of Asia would result in a change of
thermokarst and thermal erosion with negative impacts on social infrastructure and industries (medium
confidence’). [5.2.2]

 

 

Australia
and New
Zealand

 

¢ Adaptive capacity of human systems is generally high, but there are groups in Australia and New Zealand,
such as indigenous peoples in some regions, with low capacity to adapt and consequently high vulnerability.
[5.3 and 5.3.5]

° The net impact on some temperate crops of climate and CO, changes may initially be beneficial, but this
balance is expected to become negative for some areas and crops with further climate change (medium
confidence’). [5.3.3]

* Water is likely to be a key issue (high confidence’) due to projected drying trends over much of the region and
change to a more El Nifio-like average state. [5.3 and 5.3.1]

° Increases in the intensity of heavy rains and tropical cyclones (medium confidence’), and region-specific
changes in the frequency of tropical cyclones, would alter the risks to life, property, and ecosystems from
flooding, storm surges, and wind damage. [5.3.4]

° Some species with restricted climatic niches and which are unable to migrate due to fragmentation of the
landscape, soil differences, or topography could become endangered or extinct (high confidence®). Australian
ecosystems that are particularly vulnerable to climate change include coral reefs, arid and semi-arid habitats
in southwest and inland Australia, and Australian alpine systems. Freshwater wetlands in coastal zones in both
Australia and New Zealand are vulnerable, and some New Zealand ecosystems are vulnerable to accelerated
invasion by weeds. [5.3.2]

Adaptive Capacity, Vulnerability, and Key Concerns

 

Europe

° Adaptive capacity is generally high in Europe for human systems; southern Europe and the European Arctic
are more vulnerable than other parts of Europe. [5.4 and 5.4.6]

¢ Summer runoff, water availability, and soil moisture are likely to decrease in southern Europe, and would
widen the difference between the north and drought-prone south; increases are likely in winter in the north
and south (high confidence’). [5.4.1]

° Half of alpine glaciers and large permafrost areas could disappear by end of the 21st century (medium
confidence’). [5.4.1]

* River flood hazard will increase across much of Europe (medium to high confidence’); in coastal areas, the
risk of flooding, erosion, and wetland loss will increase substantially with implications for human settlement,
industry, tourism, agriculture, and coastal natural habitats. [5.4.1 and 5.4.4]

° There will be some broadly positive effects on agriculture in northern Europe (medium confidence’);
productivity will decrease in southern and eastern Europe (medium confidence’). [5.4.3]

° Upward and northward shift of biotic zones will take place. Loss of important habitats (wetlands, tundra,
isolated habitats) would threaten some species (high confidence’). [5.4.2]

° Higher temperatures and heat waves may change traditional summer tourist destinations, and less reliable
snow conditions may impact adversely on winter tourism (medium confidence’). [5.4.4]

 

Latin
America

° Adaptive capacity of human systems in Latin America is low, particularly with respect to extreme climate
events, and vulnerability is high. [5.5]

° Loss and retreat of glaciers would adversely impact runoff and water supply in areas where glacier melt is an
important water source (high confidence’). [5.5.1]

° Floods and droughts would become more frequent with floods increasing sediment loads and degrade water
quality in some areas (high confidence’). [5.5]

Increases in intensity of tropical cyclones would alter the risks to life, property, and ecosystems from heavy
rain, flooding, storm surges, and wind damages (high confidence’). [5.5]

° Yields of important crops are projected to decrease in many locations in Latin America, even when the effects
of CO, are taken into account; subsistence farming in some regions of Latin America could be threatened
(high confidence’). [5.5.4]

¢ The geographical distribution of vector-borne infectious diseases would expand poleward and to higher
elevations, and exposures to diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, and cholera will increase (medium
confidence’). [5.5.5]

* Coastal human settlements, productive activities, infrastructure, and mangrove ecosystems would be negatively
affected by sea-level rise (medium confidence’). [5.5.3]

° The rate of biodiversity loss would increase (high confidence’). [5.5.2]

 

North
America

 

e Adaptive capacity of human systems is generally high and vulnerability low in North America, but some
communities (e.g., indigenous peoples and those dependent on climate-sensitive resources) are more vulnerable;
social, economic, and demographic trends are changing vulnerabilities in subregions. [5.6 and 5.6.1]

° Some crops would benefit from modest warming accompanied by increasing CO,, but effects would vary
among crops and regions (high confidence’), including declines due to drought in some areas of Canada’s
Prairies and the U.S. Great Plains, potential increased food production in areas of Canada north of current
production areas, and increased warm-temperate mixed forest production (medium confidence®). However,
benefits for crops would decline at an increasing rate and possibly become a net loss with further warming
(medium confidence’). [5.6.4]

¢ Snowmelt-dominated watersheds in western North America will experience earlier spring peak flows (high
confidence®), reductions in summer flows (medium confidence®), and reduced lake levels and outflows for the
Great Lakes-St. Lawrence under most scenarios (medium confidence’); adaptive responses would offset some,
but not all, of the impacts on water users and on aquatic ecosystems (medium confidence’). [5.6.2]

° Unique natural ecosystems such as prairie wetlands, alpine tundra, and cold-water ecosystems will be at risk
and effective adaptation is unlikely (medium confidence’). [5.6.5]

* Sea-level rise would result in enhanced coastal erosion, coastal flooding, loss of coastal wetlands, and increased
risk from storm surges, particularly in Florida and much of the U.S. Atlantic coast (high confidence’). [5.6.1]

° Weather-related insured losses and public sector disaster relief payments in North America have been increasing;
insurance sector planning has not yet systematically included climate change information, so there is potential
for surprise (high confidence’). [5.6.1]

* Vector-borne diseases—including malaria, dengue fever, and Lyme disease—may expand their ranges in
North America; exacerbated air quality and heat stress morbidity and mortality would occur (medium
confidence’); socioeconomic factors and public health measures would play a large role in determining the
incidence and extent of health effects. [5.6.6]

Climate change in polar regions is expected to be among the largest and most rapid of any region on the Earth,
and will cause major physical, ecological, sociological, and economic impacts, especially in the Arctic, Antarctic
Peninsula, and Southern Ocean (high confidence’). [5.7]

Changes in climate that have already taken place are manifested in the decrease in extent and thickness of
Arctic sea ice, permafrost thawing, coastal erosion, changes in ice sheets and ice shelves, and altered distribution
and abundance of species in polar regions (high confidence’). [5.7]

Some polar ecosystems may adapt through eventual replacement by migration of species and changing species
composition, and possibly by eventual increases in overall productivity; ice edge systems that provide habitat
for some species would be threatened (medium confidence’). [5.7]

Polar regions contain important drivers of climate change. Once triggered, they may continue for centuries,
long after greenhouse gas concentrations are stabilized, and cause irreversible impacts on ice sheets, global
ocean circulation, and sea-level rise (medium confidence’). [5.7]

 

 

Small
Island
States

 

Adaptive capacity of human systems is generally low in small island states, and vulnerability high; small
island states are likely to be among the countries most seriously impacted by climate change. [5.8]

The projected sea-level rise of 5 mm yr"" for the next 100 years would cause enhanced coastal erosion, loss of
land and property, dislocation of people, increased risk from storm surges, reduced resilience of coastal
ecosystems, saltwater intrusion into freshwater resources, and high resource costs to respond to and adapt to
these changes (high confidence’). [5.8.2 and 5.8.5]

Islands with very limited water supplies are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change on the water
balance (high confidence’). [5.8.4]

Coral reefs would be negatively affected by bleaching and by reduced calcification rates due to higher CO,
levels (medium confidence’); mangrove, sea grass bed, and other coastal ecosystems and the associated
biodiversity would be adversely affected by rising temperatures and accelerated sea-level rise (medium
confidence’). [4.4 and 5.8.3]

Declines in coastal ecosystems would negatively impact reef fish and threaten reef fisheries, those who earn
their livelihoods from reef fisheries, and those who rely on the fisheries as a significant food source (medium
confidence’). [4.4 and 5.8.4]

Limited arable land and soil salinization makes agriculture of small island states, both for domestic food
production and cash crop exports, highly vulnerable to climate change (high confidence’). [5.8.4]

Tourism, an important source of income and foreign exchange for many islands, would face severe disruption
from climate change and sea-level rise (high confidence®). [5.8.5]

usage differs from the definition in Article 1 of the United Nations

to a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human
activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which
is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable
time periods.

"Sensitivity is the degree to which a system is affected, either
adversely or beneficially, by climate-related stimuli. Climate-
related stimuli encompass all the elements of climate change,
including mean climate characteristics, climate variability,

may be direct (e.g., a change in crop yield in response to a
change in the mean, range or variability of temperature) or
indirect (e.g., damages caused by an increase in the
frequency of coastal flooding due to sea-level rise).

"The stakes associated with projected changes in climate are
high. Numerous Earth systems that sustain human societies are
sensitive to climate and will be impacted by changes in climate
(very high confidence). Impacts can be expected in ocean
circulation; sea level; the water cycle; carbon and nutrient cycles;
air quality; the productivity and structure of natural ecosystems;
the productivity of agricultural, grazing, and timber lands; and
the geographic distribution, behavior, abundance, and survival
of plant and animal species, including vectors and hosts of
human disease. Changes in these systems in response to climate
change, as well as direct effects of climate change on humans,
would affect human welfare, positively and negatively. Human
welfare would be impacted through changes in supplies of and
demands for water, food, energy, and other tangible goods that
are derived from these systems; changes in opportunities for
nonconsumptive uses of the environment for recreation and
tourism; changes in non-use values of the environment such as
cultural and preservation values; changes in incomes; changes
in loss of property and lives from extreme climate phenomena;
and changes in human health. Climate change impacts will affect
the prospects for sustainable development in different parts of
the world and may further widen existing inequalities. Impacts
will vary in distribution across people, places, and times (very
high confidence), raising important questions about equity.

"Figure TS-1 illustrates the scope of the WGII assessment and
its relation to other parts of the climate change system. Human
activities that change the climate expose natural and human
systems to an altered set of stresses or stimuli. Systems that are
sensitive to these stimuli are affected or impacted by the changes,
which can trigger autonomous, or expected, adaptations. These
autonomous adaptations will reshape the residual or net
impacts of climate change. Policy responses in reaction to
impacts already perceived or in anticipation of potential future
impacts can take the form of planned adaptations to lessen
adverse effects or enhance beneficial ones. Policy responses
also can take the form of actions to mitigate climate change
through greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions and
enhancement of sinks. The WGII assessment focuses on the
central box of Figure TS-1—exposure, impacts, and
vulnerabilities—and the adaptation policy loop.

"Since the SAR, methods have been developed and applied to
the detection of present impacts of 20th century climate change
on abiotic and biotic systems. Assessment of impacts on human
and natural systems that already have occurred as a result of
recent climate change is an important complement to model
projections of future impacts. Such detection is impeded by
multiple, often inter-correlated, nonclimatic forces that
concurrently affect those systems. Attempts to overcome this
problem have involved the use of indicator species (e.g.,
butterflies, penguins, frogs, and sea anemones) to detect
responses to climate change and to infer more general impacts
of climate change on natural systems (e.g., in native meadows,
coastal Antarctica, tropical cloud forest, and the Pacific rocky
intertidal, respectively). An important component of this
detection process is the search for systematic patterns of change
across many studies that are consistent with expectations, based
on observed or predicted changes in climate. Confidence in
attribution of these observed changes to climate change increases
as studies are replicated across diverse systems and geographic
regions. Even though studies now number in the hundreds,
some regions and systems remain underrepresented. [2.2]

at the global or regional scale and only secondarily on issues
of impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation. Greater emphasis
on the development of methods for assessing vulnerability is
required, especially at national and subnational scales where
impacts of climate change are felt and responses are
implemented. Methods designed to include adaptation and
adaptive capacity explicitly in specific applications must be
developed. [2.4]

"Since the SAR, no new fundamental developments in costing
and valuation methodology have taken place. Many new
applications of existing methods to a widening range of climate
change issues have demonstrated, however, the strengths and
limitations of some of these methods. Research efforts are
required to strengthen methods for multi-objective assessments.
Multi-objective assessments are increasingly preferred, but
the means by which their underlying metrics might more
accurately reflect diverse social, political, economic, and
cultural contexts must be developed. In addition, methods for
integrating across these multiple metrics are still missing from
the methodological repertoire. [2.5]
"	Text
"Methods of economic costing and valuation rely on the notion
of opportunity cost of resources used, degraded, or saved.
Opportunity cost depends on whether the market is competitive
or monopolistic and on whether any externalities are
internalized. It also depends on the rate at which the future is
discounted, which can vary across countries, over time, and
over generations. The impact of uncertainty also can be valued
if the probabilities of different possible outcomes are known.
Public and nonmarket goods and services can be valued
through willingness to pay for them or willingness to accept
compensation for lack of them. Impacts on different groups,
societies, nations, and species must be assessed. Comparison
of alternative distributions of welfare across individuals and
groups within a country can be justified if they are made
according to internally consistent norms. Comparisons across
nations with different societal, ethical, and governmental
structures cannot yet be made meaningfully.
"	Text
"Methodological gaps remain concerning scales, data, validation,
and integration of adaptation and the human dimensions of
climate change. Procedures for assessing regional and local
vulnerability and long-term adaptation strategies require high-
resolution assessments, methodologies to link scales, and dynamic
modeling that uses corresponding and new data sets. Validation
at different scales often is lacking. Regional integration across
sectors is required to place vulnerability in the context of local
and regional development. Methods and tools to assess
vulnerability to extreme events have improved but are constrained
by low confidence in climate change scenarios and the sensitivity
of impact models to major climatic anomalies. Understanding
and integrating higher order economic effects and other human
dimensions of global change are required. Adaptation models
and vulnerability indices to prioritize adaptation options are at
early stages of development in many fields. Methods to enable
stakeholder participation in assessments need improvement. [2.3]

compounds, and ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation]; water availability,
use, and quality; and marine pollution. Apart from the direct

"Land-use and land-cover change scenarios. Land-use change
and land-cover change (LUC-LCC) involve several processes

radiative forcing properties. Second, LUC-LCC modifies land-
surface characteristics and, indirectly, climatic processes.
Third, land-cover modification and conversion may alter the
properties of ecosystems and their vulnerability to climate
change. Finally, several options and strategies for mitigating
GHG emissions involve land cover and changed land-use
practices. A great diversity of LUC-LCC scenarios have been
constructed. Most of these scenarios do not address climate
change issues explicitly, however; they focus on other issues—
for example, food security and carbon cycling. Large
improvements have been made since the SAR in defining

simple adjustments of the baseline climate according to
anticipated future changes that can offer a valuable aid for
testing system sensitivity to climate. However, because they
involve arbitrary adjustments, they may not be realistic
meteorologically. Analogs of a changed climate from the past

sometimes are investigated by superimposing historically

absolute or proportional change between the simulated present
and future climates. Most recent impact studies have constructed
scenarios on the basis of transient GCM outputs, although some
still apply earlier equilibrium results. The great majority of
scenarios represent changes in mean climate; some recent
scenarios, however, also have incorporated changes in variability
and extreme weather events, which can lead to important
impacts for some systems. Regional detail is obtained from
the coarse-scale outputs of GCMs by using three main
methods: simple interpolation, statistical downscaling, and
high-resolution dynamical modeling. The simple method,
which reproduces the GCM pattern of change, is the most
widely applied in scenario development. In contrast, the
statistical and modeling approaches can produce local climate
changes that are different from large-scale GCM estimates.
More research is needed to evaluate the value added to impact
studies of such regionalization exercises. One reason for this
caution is the large uncertainty of GCM projections, which
requires further quantification through model intercomparisons,
new model simulations, and pattern scaling methods. [3.5.2,

climatic variations such as changes in the average, range, and
variability of temperature and precipitation, as well as the
frequency and severity of weather events. Systems also would
be exposed to indirect effects from climate change such as
sea-level rise, soil moisture changes, changes in land and water
condition, changes in the frequency of fire and pest infestation,
and changes in the distribution of infectious disease vectors
and hosts. The sensitivity of a system to these exposures
depends on system characteristics and includes the potential
for adverse and beneficial effects. The potential for a system to
sustain adverse impacts is moderated by adaptive capacity. The

"In terms of mean changes in regional climate, results from
GCMs that have been run assuming the new SRES emissions
scenarios display many similarities with previous runs. The
WGI contribution to the TAR concludes that rates of warming
are expected to be greater than the global average over most
land areas and will be most pronounced at high latitudes in
winter. As warming proceeds, northern hemisphere snow cover
and sea-ice extent will be reduced. Models indicate warming
below the global average in the north Atlantic and circumpolar
southern ocean regions, as well as in southern and southeast
Asia and southern South America in June-August. Globally,
there will be increases in average water vapor and precipitation.
Regionally, December-February precipitation is expected to
increase over the northern extratropics, Antarctica, and tropical
Africa. Models also agree on a decrease in precipitation over
Central America and little change in southeast Asia. Precipitation
in June-August is estimated to increase in high northern

of global change also have been calculated; some of these
implications are summarized for 2050 and 2100 in Table TS-1.
For example, mean ground-level ozone concentrations in July
over the industrialized continents of the northern hemisphere
are projected to rise from about 40 ppb in 2000 to more than
70 ppb in 2100 under the highest illustrative SRES emissions
scenarios; by comparison, the clean-air standard is below 80
ppb. Peak levels of ozone in local smog events could be many
times higher. Estimates of CO, concentration range from 478
ppm to1099 ppm by 2100, given the range of SRES emissions
and uncertainties about the carbon cycle (Table TS-1). This
range of implied radiative forcing gives rise to an estimated global
warming from 1990 to 2100 of 1.4-5.8°C, assuming a range
of climate sensitivities. This range is higher than the 0.7-3.5°C
of the SAR because of higher levels of radiative forcing in the
SRES scenarios than in the IS92a-f scenarios—primarily as a
result of lower sulfate aerosol emissions, especially after 2050.
The equivalent range of estimates of global sea-level rise (for
this range of global temperature change in combination with a
range of ice melt sensitivities) to 2100 is 9-88 cm (compared

interactions between the aforementioned factors (e.g., arctic
terrestrial ecosystems and wetlands may act as sources and
sinks) (medium confidence).

"Increasing CO, concentration would increase net primary
productivity (plant growth, litterfall, and mortality) in most
systems, whereas increasing temperature may have positive
or negative effects (high confidence). Experiments on tree
species grown under elevated CO, over several years show
continued and consistent stimulation of photosynthesis and
little evidence of long-term loss of sensitivity to CO,. However,
changes in net ecosystem productivity (which includes plant
growth, litterfall, mortality, litter decomposition, and soil carbon
dynamics) and net biome productivity (which includes those
effects plus the effects of fire or other disturbances) are less
likely to be positive and may be generally negative. Research
reported since the SAR confirms the view that the largest and
earliest impacts induced by climate change are likely to occur
in boreal forests, through changes in weather-related disturbance
regimes and nutrient cycling. [5.6.1.1, 5.6.3.1]

"Contrary to the SAR, global timber market studies that include
adaptations through land and product management suggest
that climate change would increase global timber supply

extent and nature of adaptation will depend primarily on wood
and non-wood product prices, the relative value of substitutes,
the cost of management, and technology. On specific sites,
changes in forest growth and productivity will constrain—
and could limit—choices regarding adaptation strategies (high
confidence). In markets, prices will mediate adaptation through
land and product management. Adaptation in managed forests
will include salvaging dead and dying timber, replanting new
species that are better suited to the new climate, planting
genetically modified species, and intensifying or decreasing
management. Consumers will benefit from lower timber prices;
producers may gain or lose, depending on regional changes in
timber productivity and potential dieback effects. [5.6]

a combination of accelerated sea-level rise, more energetic
wave climate with reduced sea-ice cover, and increased ground
temperatures that promote thaw of permafrost and ground ice

severe impacts on settlements and infrastructure and will result
in rapid coastal retreat. [6.4.6]

"Many coastal areas already are experiencing increased levels
of sea flooding, accelerated coastal erosion, and seawater
intrusion into freshwater sources; these processes will be
exacerbated by climate change and sea-level rise. Sea-level
rise in particular has contributed to erosion of sandy and gravel
beaches and barriers; loss of coastal dunes and wetlands; and
drainage problems in many low-lying, mid-latitude coastal
areas. Highly diverse and productive coastal ecosystems,
coastal settlements, and island states will continue to be
exposed to pressures whose impacts are expected to be largely
negative and potentially disastrous in some instances. [6.4]

"Low-latitude tropical and subtropical coastlines, particularly
in areas where there is significant human population pressure,
are highly susceptible to climate change impacts. These
impacts will exacerbate many present-day problems. For
instance, human activities have increased land subsidence in
many deltaic regions by increasing subsurface water withdrawals,
draining wetland soils, and reducing or cutting off riverine
sediment loads. Problems of inundation, salinization of potable
groundwater, and coastal erosion will all be accelerated with
global sea-level rise superimposed on local submergence.
Especially at risk are large delta regions of Asia and small
islands whose vulnerability was recognized more than a decade
ago and continues to increase. [6.4.3, 6.5.3]

"Growing recognition of the role of the climate-ocean system
in the management of fish stocks is leading to new adaptive
strategies that are based on the determination of acceptable
removable percentages of fish and stock resilience. Another
consequence of the recognition of climate-related changes in
the distribution of marine fish populations suggests that the
sustainability of many nations’ fisheries will depend on
adaptations that increase flexibility in bilateral and multilateral
fishing agreements, coupled with international stock
assessments and management plans. Creating sustainable
fisheries also depends on understanding synergies between
climate-related impacts on fisheries and factors such as harvest
pressure and habitat conditions. [6.3.4, 6.6.4]

"Global climate change will result in increases in sea-surface
temperature (SST) and sea level; decreases in sea-ice cover;
and changes in salinity, wave climate, and ocean circulation.
Some of these changes already are taking place. Changes in
oceans are expected to have important feedback effects on
global climate and on the climate of the immediate coastal
area (see TAR WGI). They also would have profound impacts
on the biological production of oceans, including fish
production. For instance, changes in global water circulation
and vertical mixing will affect the distribution of biogenic
elements and the efficiency of CO, uptake by the ocean;
changes in upwelling rates would have major impacts on
coastal fish production and coastal climates. [6.3]

"aquaculture production has more than doubled since 1990,
and in 1997 represented approximately 30% of total commercial
fish and shellfish production for human consumption.
However, future aquaculture productivity may be limited by
ocean stocks of herring, anchovies, and other species that are
used to provide fishmeal and fish oils to feed cultured species,
which may be negatively impacted by climate change.
Decreases in dissolved oxygen levels associated with increased
seawater temperatures and enrichment of organic matter
creates conditions for the spread of diseases in wild and
aquaculture fisheries, as well as outbreaks of algal blooms in
coastal areas. Pollution and habitat destruction that can
accompany aquaculture also may place limits on its expansion
and on the survival success of wild stocks. [6.3.5]

"Ifwarm events associated with El Nifios increase in frequency,
plankton biomass and fish larvae abundance would decline
and adversely impact fish, marine mammals, seabirds, and
ocean biodiversity (high confidence). In addition to El Nifio-
Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability, the persistence of
multi-year climate-ocean regimes and switches from one
regime to another have been recognized since the SAR.
Changes in recruitment patterns of fish populations have been
linked to such switches. Fluctuations in fish abundance are
increasingly regarded as biological responses to medium-term
climate fluctuations in addition to overfishing and other
anthropogenic factors. Similarly, survival of marine mammals
and seabirds also is affected by interannual and longer term
variability in several oceanographic and atmospheric
properties and processes, especially in high latitudes. [6.3.4]

"Vulnerabilities have been documented for a variety of coastal
settings, initially by using a common methodology developed
in the early 1990s. These and subsequent studies have
confirmed the spatial and temporal variability of coastal
vulnerability at national and regional levels. Within the
common methodology, three coastal adaptation strategies have
been identified: protect, accommodate, and retreat. Since the
SAR, adaptation strategies for coastal zones have shifted in
emphasis away from hard protection structures (e.g., seawalls,
groins) toward soft protection measures (e.g., beach
nourishment), managed retreat, and enhanced resilience of
biophysical and socioeconomic systems, including the use of
flood insurance to spread financial risk. [6.6.1, 6.6.2]

"rise on mangroves and salt marshes will depend on the rate of
rise relative to vertical accretion and space for horizontal
migration, which can be limited by human development in
coastal areas. Healthy coral reefs are likely to be able to keep
up with sea-level rise, but this is less certain for reefs degraded
by coral bleaching, UV-B radiation, pollution, and other
stresses. Episodes of coral bleaching over the past 20 years
have been associated with several causes, including increased
ocean temperatures. Future sea-surface warming would
increase stress on coral reefs and result in increased frequency
of marine diseases (high confidence). Changes in ocean
chemistry resulting from higher CO, levels may have a negative
impact on coral reef development and health, which would
have a detrimental effect on coastal fisheries and on social
and economic uses of reef resources. [6.4.4, 6.4.5]

Economic sectors that support the settlement are affected
because of changes in productive capacity (e.g., in
agriculture or fisheries) or changes in market demand for
goods and services produced there (including demand from
people living nearby and from tourism). The importance
of this impact depends in part on whether the settlement is
rural—which generally means that it is dependent on one
or two resource-based industries—or urban, in which case
there usually (but not always) is a broader array of
alternative resources. It also depends on the adaptive
capacity of the settlement. [7.1]

Some aspects of physical infrastructure (including energy
transmission and distribution systems), buildings, urban
services (including transportation systems), and specific
industries (such as agroindustry, tourism, and construction)
may be directly affected. For example, buildings and
infrastructure in deltaic areas may be affected by coastal
and river flooding; urban energy demand may increase or
decrease as a result of changed balances in space heating
and space cooling; and coastal and mountain tourism may be
affected by changed seasonal temperature and precipitation
patterns and sea-level rise. Concentration of population
and infrastructure in urban areas can mean higher numbers
of persons and higher value of physical capital at risk,
although there also are many economies of scale and
proximity in ensuring well-managed infrastructure and
service provision. When these factors are combined with
other prevention measures, risks can be reduced considerably.
However, some larger urban centers in Africa, Asia, Latin
America, and the Caribbean, as well as smaller settlements
(including villages and small urban centers), often have
less wealth, political power, and institutional capacity to
reduce risks in this way. [7.1]

Population may be directly affected through extreme
weather, changes in health status, or migration. Extreme
weather episodes may lead to changes in deaths, injuries,
or illness. For example, health status may improve as a
result of reduced cold stress or deteriorate as a result of
increased heat stress and disease. Population movements
caused by climate changes may affect the size and
characteristics of settlement populations, which in turn
changes the demand for urban services. The problems are
somewhat different in the largest population centers (e.g.,
those of more than 1 million population) and mid-sized to
small-sized regional centers. The former are more likely
to be destinations for migrants from rural areas and smaller

the lower end are effects such as permafrost melting and heat
island effects—which, although important locally, may not
apply to as wide a variety of settlements or hold less importance
once adaptation is taken into account. [7.2, 7.3]

"Possible adaptation options involve planning of settlements and
their infrastructure, placement of industrial facilities, and making
similar long-lived decisions to reduce the adverse effects of
events that are of low (but increasing) probability and high
(and perhaps rising) consequences. Many specific conventional
and advanced techniques can contribute to better environmental
planning and management, including market-based tools for
pollution control, demand management and waste reduction,
mixed-use zoning and transport planning (with appropriate
provision for pedestrians and cyclists), environmental impact
assessments, capacity studies, strategic environmental plans,
environmental audit procedures, and state-of-the-environment
reports. Many cities have used a combination of these strategies
in developing “Local Agenda 21s.” Many Local Agenda 21s
deal with a list of urban problems that could closely interact
with climate change in the future. [7.2, 7.5]

"Table TS-3 classifies several types of climate-caused environmental
changes discussed in the climate and human settlement
literatures. The table features three general types of settlements,
each based on one of the three major mechanisms by which
climate affects settlements. The impacts correspond to the
mechanism of the effect. Thus, a given settlement may be
affected positively by effects of climate change on its resource
base (e.g., more agricultural production) and negatively by
effects on its infrastructure (e.g., more frequent flooding of its
water works and overload of its electrical system). Different types
of settlements may experience these effects in different relative
intensities (e.g., noncoastal settlements do not directly experience
impacts through sea-level rise); the impacts are ranked from
overall highest to lowest importance. Most settlement effects
literature is based on 2xCO, scenarios or studies describing
the impact of current weather events (analogs) but has been
placed in context of the IPCC transient scenarios. [7.1]
"	Text
"Global warming is expected to result in increases in energy
demand for spacing cooling and in decreased energy use for
space heating. Increases in heat waves add to cooling energy
demand, and decreases in cold waves reduce heating energy
demand. The projected net effect on annual energy consumption
is scenario- and location-specific. Adapting human settlements,
energy systems, and industry to climate change provides
challenges for the design and operation of settlements (in some
cases) during more severe weather and opportunities to take
advantage (in other cases) of more benign weather. For
instance, transmission systems of electric systems are known to
be adversely affected by extreme events such as tropical cyclones,
tornadoes, and ice storms. The existence of local capacity to
limit environmental hazards or their health consequences in
any settlement generally implies local capacity to adapt to
climate change, unless adaptation implies particularly expensive
infrastructure investment. Adaptation to warmer climate will
require local tuning of settlements to a changing environment,
not just warmer temperatures. Urban experts are unanimous
that successful environmental adaptation cannot occur without
locally based, technically and institutionally competent, and
politically supported leadership that have good access to
national-level resources. [7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5]

"Climate change has the potential to create local and regional
conditions that involve water deficits and surpluses, sometimes
seasonally in the same geographic locations. The most widespread
serious potential impacts are flooding, landslides, mudslides,
and avalanches driven by projected increases in rainfall
intensity and sea-level rise. A growing literature suggests that
a very wide variety of settlements in nearly every climate zone
may be affected (established but incomplete). Riverine and
coastal settlements are believed to be particularly at risk, but
urban flooding could be a problem anywhere storm drains,
water supply, and waste management systems are not designed
with enough capacity or sophistication (including conventional
hardening and more advanced system design) to avoid being
overwhelmed. The next most serious threats are tropical cyclones
(hurricanes or typhoons), which may increase in peak intensity
in a warmer world. Tropical cyclones combine the effects of
heavy rainfall, high winds, and storm surge in coastal areas
and can be disruptive far inland, but they are not as universal
in location as floods and landslides. Tens of millions of people
live in the settlements potentially flooded. For example,
estimates of the mean annual number of people who would be
flooded by coastal storm surges increase several-fold (by 75
million to 200 million people, depending on adaptive responses)
for mid-range scenarios of a 40-cm sea-level rise by the 2080s
relative to scenarios with no sea-level rise. Potential damages

is complex, and there are differences in the balance of these
two causes by region and by type of event. Many of the

mechanisms through which the costs of weather-related events
are distributed among other sectors and throughout society.
However, insurance, whether provided by public or private

by fostering development in at-risk areas such as U.S.
floodplains or coastal zones. The effects of climate change on

"Trends toward increasing firm size, diversification, and
integration of insurance with other financial services, as well
as improved tools to transfer risk, all potentially contribute to
robustness. However, the property/casualty insurance and
reinsurance segments have greater sensitivity, and individual
companies already have experienced catastrophe-related
bankruptcies triggered by weather events. Under some conditions
and in some regions, the banking industry as a provider of

the relative role of each can be expected to change. Some
potential response options offer co-benefits that support

average, several hundred extra deaths each summer. Although
the impact of climate change on thermal stress-related mortality
in developing country cities may be significant, there has been
little research in such populations. Warmer winters and fewer

"Food insecurity appears to be the primary concern for Asia.
Crop production and aquaculture would be threatened by
thermal and water stresses, sea-level rise, increased flooding,
and strong winds associated with intense tropical cyclones

and high latitudes will experience increases in crop yield; yields
in lower latitudes generally will decrease. A longer duration
of the summer season should lead to a northward shift of the
agroecosystem boundary in boreal Asia and favor an overall
increase in agriculture productivity (medium confidence).
Climatic variability and change also will affect scheduling of
the cropping season, as well as the duration of the growing
period of the crop. In China, yields of several major crops are
expected to decline as a result of climate change. Acute water
shortages combined with thermal stress should adversely affect
wheat and, more severely, rice productivity in India even under
the positive effects of elevated CO, in the future. Crop diseases
such as wheat scab, rice blast, and sheath and culm blight of
rice also could become more widespread in temperate and
tropical regions of Asia if the climate becomes warmer and
wetter. Adaptation measures to reduce the negative effects of
climatic variability may include changing the cropping
calendar to take advantage of the wet period and to avoid the

consequences for small island states are likely to be related to
changes in rainfall regimes, soil moisture budgets, prevailing
winds (speed and direction), short-term variations in regional

variability, with an upward trend in average temperature by as
much as 0.1°C per decade and sea-level rise of 2 mm yr* in
the tropical ocean regions in which most of the small island

islands are experiencing high incidences of vector- and water-
borne diseases that are attributable to changes in temperature
and rainfall, which may be linked to the ENSO phenomenon,
droughts, and floods. Climate extremes also create a huge burden
on some areas of human welfare, and these burdens are likely
to increase in the future. Almost all settlements, socioeconomic
infrastructure, and activities such as tourism are located at or
near coastal areas in small island states. Tourism provides a
major source of revenue and employment for many small island
states (Table TS-13). Changes in temperature and rainfall
regimes, as well as loss of beaches, could devastate the
economies of many small island states (high confidence).
Because these areas are very vulnerable to future climate
change and sea-level rise, it is important to protect and nourish
beaches and sites by implementing programs that constitute
wise use resources. Integrated coastal management has been
identified as one approach that would be useful for many small
island states for a sustainable tourism industry. [17.2.7, 17.2.9]

"The capacity to adapt varies considerably among regions,
countries, and socioeconomic groups and will vary over time.
Table TS-14 summarizes adaptation measures and capacities
by sector, and Table TS-15 provides this information for each
region covered by the TAR. The most vulnerable regions and
communities are highly exposed to hazardous climate change
effects and have limited adaptive capacity. The ability to adapt
and cope with climate change impacts is a function of wealth,
scientific and technical knowledge, information, skills,
infrastructure, institutions, and equity. Countries with limited
economic resources, low levels of technology, poor information
and skills, poor infrastructure, unstable or weak institutions,
and inequitable empowerment and access to resources have
little capacity to adapt and are highly vulnerable. Groups and
regions with adaptive capacity that is limited along any of
these dimensions are more vulnerable to climate change
damages, just as they are more vulnerable to other stresses.

"Activities required for enhancement of adaptive capacity are
essentially equivalent to those promoting sustainable
development. Enhancement of adaptive capacity is a necessary
condition for reducing vulnerability, particularly for the most
vulnerable regions, nations, and socioeconomic groups. Many
sectors and regions that are vulnerable to climate change also
are under pressure from forces such as population growth and
resource depletion. Climate adaptation and sustainability goals
can be jointly advanced by changes in policies that lessen
pressure on resources, improve management of environmental
risks, and enhance adaptive capacity. Climate adaptation and
equity goals can be jointly pursued through initiatives that
promote the welfare of the poorest members of society—for
example, by improving food security, facilitating access to
safe water and health care, and providing shelter and access
to other resources. Development decisions, activities, and
programs play important roles in modifying the adaptive
capacity of communities and regions, yet they tend not to take
into account risks associated with climate variability and change.
Inclusion of climatic risks in the design and implementation of
development initiatives is necessary to reduce vulnerability
and enhance sustainability. [18.6.1]

Sector

Key Findings

 

Water Resources

- Water managers have experience with adapting to change. Many techniques exist to assess and
implement adaptive options. However, the pervasiveness of climate change may preclude some
traditional adaptive strategies, and available adaptations often are not used.

- Adaptation can involve management on the supply side (e.g., altering infrastructure or institutional
arrangements) and on the demand side (changing demand or risk reduction). Numerous no-regret
policies exist, which will generate net social benefits regardless of climate change.

- Climate change is just one of numerous pressures facing water managers. Nowhere are water management
decisions taken solely to cope with climate change, although it is increasingly considered for future
resource management. Some vulnerabilities are outside the conventional responsibility of water managers.

- Estimates of the economic costs of climate change impacts on water resources depend strongly on
assumptions made about adaptation. Economically optimum adaptation may be prevented by
constraints associated with uncertainty, institutions, and equity.

- Extreme events often are catalysts for change in water management, by exposing vulnerabilities and
raising awareness of climate risks. Climate change modifies indicators of extremes and variability,
complicating adaptation decisions.

- Ability to adapt is affected by institutional capacity, wealth, management philosophy, planning time
scale, organizational and legal framework, technology, and population mobility.

- Water managers need research and management tools aimed at adapting to uncertainty and change,
rather than improving climate scenarios.

 

Ecosystems and
Their Services

- Adaptation to loss of some ecosystem services may be possible, especially in managed ecosystems.
However, adaptation to losses in wild ecosystems and biodiversity may be difficult or impossible.

- There is considerable capacity for adaptation in agriculture, including crop changes and resource
substitutions, but adaptation to evolving climate change and interannual variability is uncertain.

- Adaptations in agriculture are possible, but they will not happen without considerable transition costs
and equilibrium (or residual) costs.

- Greater adverse impacts are expected in areas where resource endowments are poorest and the ability
of farmers to adapt is most limited.

- In many countries where rangelands are important, lack of infrastructure and investment in resource
management limit options for adaptation.

- Commercial forestry is adaptable, reflecting a history of long-term management decisions under
uncertainty. Adaptations are expected in land-use management (species-selection silviculture) and
product management (processing-marketing).

- Adaptation in developed countries will fare better, while developing countries and countries in
transition, especially in the tropics and subtropics, will fare worse.

 

Coastal Zones

- Without adaptations, the consequences of global warming and sea-level rise would be disastrous.

- Coastal adaptation entails more than just selecting one of the technical options to respond to sea-level
rise (strategies can aim to protect, accommodate, or retreat). It is a complex and iterative process
rather than a simple choice.

- Adaptation options are more acceptable and effective when they are incorporated into coastal zone
management, disaster mitigation programs, land-use planning, and sustainable development strategies.

- Adaptation choices will be conditioned by existing policies and development objectives, requiring
researchers and policymakers to work toward a commonly acceptable framework for adaptation.

- The adaptive capacity of coastal systems to perturbations is related to coastal resilience, which has
morphological, ecological, and socioeconomic components. Enhancing resilience—including the technical,
institutional, economic, and cultural capability to cope with impacts—is a particularly appropriate
adaptive strategy given future uncertainties and the desire to maintain development opportunities.

- Coastal communities and marine-based economic sectors with low exposure or high adaptive capacity
will be least affected. Communities with lower economic resources, poorer infrastructure, less-
developed communications and transportation systems, and weak social support systems have less
access to adaptation options and are more vulnerable.

 

 

Human
Settlements,
Energy, and
Industry

 

- Larger and more costly impacts of climate change occur through changed probabilities of extreme
weather events that overwhelm the design resiliency of human systems.

- Many adaptation options are available to reduce the vulnerability of settlements. However, urban
managers, especially in developing countries, have so little capacity to deal with current problems
(housing, sanitation, water, and power) that dealing with climate change risks is beyond their means.

- Lack of financial resources, weak institutions, and inadequate or inappropriate planning are major
barriers to adaptation in human settlements.

- Successful environmental adaptation cannot occur without locally based, technically competent, and
politically supported leadership.

- Uncertainty with respect to capacity and the will to respond hinder assessment of adaptation and
vulnerability.

Sector Key Findings

Insurance and - Adaptation in financial and insurance services in the short term is likely to be to changing frequencies
Other Financial and intensities of extreme weather events.

Services - Increasing risk could lead to a greater volume of traditional business and development of new financial

risk management products, but increased variability of loss events would heighten actuarial uncertainty.

- Financial services firms have adaptability to external shocks, but there is little evidence that climate
change is being incorporated into investment decisions.

- The adaptive capacity of the financial sector is influenced by regulatory involvement, the ability of
firms to withdraw from at-risk markets, and fiscal policy regarding catastrophe reserves.

- Adaptation will involve changes in the roles of private and public insurance. Changes in the timing,
intensity, frequency, and/or spatial distribution of climate-related losses will generate increased
demand on already overburdened government insurance and disaster assistance programs.

- Developing countries seeking to adapt in a timely manner face particular difficulties, including limited
availability of capital, poor access to technology, and absence of government programs.

- Insurers’ adaptations include raising prices, non-renewal of policies, cessation of new policies,
limiting maximum claims, and raising deductibles—actions that can seriously affect investment in
developing countries.

- Developed countries generally have greater adaptive capacity, including technology and economic
means to bear costs.

 

Human Health - Adaptation involves changes in society, institutions, technology, or behavior to reduce potential
negative impacts or increase positive ones. There are numerous adaptation options, which may occur
at the population, community, or personal levels.

- The most important and cost-effective adaptation measure is to rebuild public health infrastructure—
which, in much of the world, has declined in recent years. Many diseases and health problems that
may be exacerbated by climate change can be effectively prevented with adequate financial and
human public health resources, including training, surveillance and emergency response, and
prevention and control programs.

- Adaptation effectiveness will depend on timing. “Primary” prevention aims to reduce risks before
cases occur, whereas “secondary” interventions are designed to prevent further cases.

- Determinants of adaptive capacity to climate-related threats include level of material resources,
effectiveness of governance and civil institutions, quality of public health infrastructure, and
preexisting burden of disease.

- Capacity to adapt also will depend on research to understand associations between climate, weather,
extreme events, and vector-borne diseases.

Sector Key Findings
Latin America - Adaptation measures have potential to reduce climate-related losses in agriculture and forestry.
- There are opportunities for adapting to water shortages and flooding through water resource management.
- Adaptation measures in the fishery sector include changing species captured and increasing prices to
reduce losses.
North America _| - Strain on social and economic systems from rapid climate and sea-level changes will increase the need

for explicit adaptation strategies. In some cases, adaptation may yield net benefits, especially if
climate change is slow.

- Stakeholders in most sectors believe that technology is available to adapt, although at some social and
economic cost.

- Adaptation is expected to be more successful in agriculture and forestry. However, adaptations for water,
health, food, energy, and cities are likely to require substantial institutional and infrastructure changes.

- In the water sector, adaptations to seasonal runoff changes include storage, conjunctive supply
management, and transfer. It may not be possible to continue current high levels of reliability of water
supply, especially with transfers to high-valued uses. Adaptive measures such as “water markets” may
lead to concerns about accessibility and conflicts over allocation priorities.

- Adaptations such as levees and dams often are successful in managing most variations in weather but
can increase vulnerability to the most extreme events.

- There is moderate potential for adaptation through conservation programs that protect particularly
threatened ecosystems, such as high alpines and wetlands. It may be difficult or impossible to offset
adverse impacts on aquatic systems.

 

Polar Regions

- Adaptation will occur in natural polar ecosystems through migration and changing mixes of species.
Species such as walrus, seals, and polar bears will be threatened; while others, such as fish, may flourish.

- Potential for adaptation is limited in indigenous communities that follow traditional lifestyles.

- Technologically developed communities are likely to adapt quite readily, although the high capital
investment required may result in costs in maintaining lifestyles.

- Adaptation depends on technological advances, institutional arrangements, availability of financing,
and information exchange.

 

Small Island
States

 

- The need for adaptation has become increasingly urgent, even if swift implementation of global
agreements to reduce future emissions occurs.

- Most adaptation will be carried out by people and communities that inhabit island countries; support
from governments is essential for implementing adaptive measures.

- Progress will require integration of appropriate risk-reduction strategies with other sectoral policy
initiatives in areas such as sustainable development planning, disaster prevention and management,
integrated coastal zone management, and health care planning.

- Strategies for adaptation to sea-level rise are retreat, accommodate, and protect. Measures such as
retreat to higher ground, raising of the land, and use of building set-backs appear to have little
practical utility, especially when hindered by limited physical size.

- Measures for reducing the severity of health threats include health education programs, health care
facilities, sewerage and solid waste management, and disaster preparedness plans.

- Islanders have developed some capacity to adapt by application of traditional knowledge, locally
appropriate technology, and customary practice. Overall adaptive capacity is low, however, because of
the physical size of nations, limited access to capital and technology, shortage of human resource
skills, lack of tenure security, overcrowding, and limited access to resources for construction.

- Many small islands require external financial, technical, and other assistance to adapt. Adaptive
capacity may be enhanced by regional cooperation and pooling of limited resources.

"With a small temperature increase, aggregate market-sector
impacts could amount to plus or minus a few percent of world
GDP (medium confidence); aggregate nonmarket impacts
could be negative (low confidence). The small net impacts

many of which could have positive impacts, contribute the
majority of global production. Applying more weight to impacts
in poorer countries to reflect equity concerns, however, can
result in net aggregate impacts that are negative even at medium
warming. It also is possible that a majority of people will be
negatively affected by climate change scenarios in this range,
even if the net aggregate monetary impact is positive. With
medium to higher temperature increases, benefits tend to decrease
and damages increase, so the net change in global economic
welfare becomes negative—and increasingly negative with
greater warming (medium confidence). Some sectors, such as
coastal and water resources, could have negative impacts in
developed and developing countries. Other sectors, such as
agriculture and human health, could have net positive impacts in

"Developing countries tend to be more vulnerable to climate
change than developed countries (high confidence). Developing
countries are expected to suffer more adverse impacts than
developed countries (medium confidence). A small temperature
increase would have net negative impacts on market sectors
in many developing countries (medium confidence) and net
positive impacts on market sectors in many developed countries
(medium confidence). The different results are attributable
partly to differences in exposures and sensitivities (e.g., present
temperatures are below optimal in mid- and high latitudes for
many crops but at or above optimal in low latitudes) and partly
to lesser adaptive capacity in developing countries relative to
developed countries. At a medium temperature increase, net
positive impacts would start to turn negative and negative
impacts would be exacerbated (high confidence). The results
of these studies do not fully take into account nonmarket
impacts of climate change such as impacts on natural systems,
which may be sensitive to small amounts of warming.
Particularly vulnerable regions include deltaic regions, low-lying
small island states, and many arid regions where droughts and
water availability are problematic even without climate change.
Within regions or countries, impacts are expected to fall most
heavily, in relative terms, on impoverished persons. The poorest
members of society can be inferred to be most vulnerable to
climate change because of their lack of resources with which
to cope and adapt to impacts, but few studies have explicitly
examined the distribution of impacts on the poor relative to
other segments of society. [19.4]

"Whether impacts and vulnerability increase or decrease with
time is likely to depend in part on the rates of climate change
and development and may differ for managed and unmanaged
systems. The more rapid the rate of climate change, the greater
would be future exposure to potentially adverse changes and
the greater the potential for exceeding system thresholds. The
more rapid the rate of development, the more resources would
be exposed to climate change in the future—but so too would
the adaptive capacity of future societies. The benefits of
increased adaptive capacity are likely to be greater for intensively
managed systems than for systems that presently are unmanaged
or lightly managed. For this reason, and because of the possibility
that nonclimate pressures on natural systems may increase in
the future, the vulnerability of natural systems is expected to
increase with time (medium confidence). [19.4.2, 19.4.3]

stresses that confront human and natural systems. The severity
of many of these stresses will be determined in part by the
development paths followed by human societies; paths that
generate lesser stresses are expected to lessen the vulnerability
of human and natural systems to climate change. Development
also can influence future vulnerability by enhancing adaptive
capacity through accumulation of wealth, technology,
information, skills, and appropriate infrastructure; development
of effective institutions; and advancement of equity. Climate

"Human-induced climate change has the potential to trigger
large-scale changes in Earth systems that could have severe
consequences at regional or global scales. The probabilities
of triggering such events are poorly understood but should
not be ignored, given the severity of their consequences. Events
of this type that might be triggered include complete or partial
shutdown of the North Atlantic and Antarctic Deep Water
formation, disintegration of the West Antarctic and Greenland
Ice Sheets, and major perturbations of biosphere-regulated
carbon dynamics. Determining the timing and probability of
occurrence of large-scale discontinuities is difficult because
these events are triggered by complex interactions between
components of the climate system. The actual discontinuous
impact could lag the trigger by decades to centuries. These
triggers are sensitive to the magnitude and rate of climate
change. Large temperature increases have the potential to lead
to large-scale discontinuities in the climate system (medium

"An increase in the frequency and magnitude of extreme events
would have adverse effects throughout sectors and regions.
Agriculture and water resources may be particularly vulnerable
to changes in hydrological and temperature extremes. Coastal
infrastructure and ecosystems may be adversely affected by
changes in the occurrence of tropical cyclones and storm
surges. Heat-related mortality is likely to increase with higher
temperatures; cold-related mortality is likely to decrease.
Floods may lead to the spread of water-related and vector-
borne diseases, particularly in developing countries. Many of
the monetary damages from extreme events will have
repercussions on a broad scale of financial institutions, from
insurers and reinsurers to investors, banks, and disaster relief

time, whether due to natural variability or as a result of human activity.
This usage differs from that in the UNFCCC, where climate change

human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere
and that is in addition to natural climate variability observed over
comparable time periods.

differentiation of contributions of countries to mitigation and
related equity issues also considers these circumstances*. The
challenge of addressing climate change raises an important issue
of equity, namely the extent to which the impacts of climate change
or mitigation policies create or exacerbate inequities both within
and across nations and regions. Greenhouse gas stabilization

in Figure SPM-1e, and the B2 group with stabilization at 450, 550 and 650 ppmv in Figure SPM-1f. The literature is not available to assess
1000 ppmv stabilization scenarios. The figure illustrates that the lower the stabilization level and the higher the baseline emissions, the wider
the gap. The difference between emissions in different scenario groups can be as large as the gap between reference and stabilization
scenarios within one scenario group. The dotted lines depict the boundaries of the ranges where they overlap.

"8. Forests, agricultural lands, and other terrestrial ecosystems
offer significant carbon mitigation potential. Although not
necessarily permanent, conservation and sequestration of
carbon may allow time for other options to be further
developed and implemented. Biological mitigation can occur
by three strategies: (a) conservation of existing carbon pools,
(b) sequestration by increasing the size of carbon pools, and
(c) substitution of sustainably produced biological products,
e.g. wood for energy intensive construction products and
biomass for fossil fuels (Sections 3.6, 4.3). Conservation of
threatened carbon pools may help to avoid emissions, if
leakage can be prevented, and can only become sustainable if
the socio-economic drivers for deforestation and other losses
of carbon pools can be addressed. Sequestration reflects the
biological dynamics of growth, often starting slowly, passing
through a maximum, and then declining over decades to

"Fora variety of factors, significant differences and uncertainties
surround specific quantitative estimates of the costs and
benefits of mitigation options. The SAR described two
categories of approaches to estimating costs and benefits:
bottom-up approaches, which build up from assessments of
specific technologies and sectors, such as those described
in Paragraph 7, and top-down modelling studies, which
proceed from macroeconomic relationships, such as those
discussed in Paragraph 13. These two approaches lead to
differences in the estimates of costs and benefits, which have
been narrowed since the SAR. Even if these differences were
resolved, other uncertainties would remain. The potential
impact of these uncertainties can be usefully assessed by
examining the effect of a change in any given assumption
on the aggregate cost results, provided any correlation between
variables is adequately dealt with.

"10. Social learning and innovation, and changes in institutional
structure could contribute to climate change mitigation.
Changes in collective rules and individual behaviours may
have significant effects on greenhouse gas emissions, but take
place within a complex institutional, regulatory and legal
setting. Several studies suggest that current incentive systems
can encourage resource intensive production and consumption
patterns that increase greenhouse gas emissions in all sectors,
e.g. transport and housing. In the shorter term, there are
opportunities to influence through social innovations individual
and organizational behaviours. In the longer term such
innovations, in combination with technological change, may
further enhance socio-economic potential, particularly if
preferences and cultural norms shift towards lower emitting
and sustainable behaviours. These innovations frequently meet
with resistance, which may be addressed by encouraging
greater public participation in the decision-making processes.
This can help contribute to new approaches to sustainability
and equity (Sections 1.4.3, 5.3.8, 10.3.2, 10.3.4).

 
"	Text
"9. There is no single path to a low emission future and countries
and regions will have to choose their own path. Most model
results indicate that known technological options* could
achieve a broad range of atmospheric CO, stabilization levels,
such as 550ppmv, 450ppmv or below over the next 100 years
or more, but implementation would require associated socio-
economic and institutional changes. To achieve stabilization
at these levels, the scenarios suggest that a very significant
reduction in world carbon emissions per unit of GDP from
1990 levels will be necessary. Technological improvement and
technology transfer play a critical role in the stabilization
scenarios assessed in this report. For the crucial energy sector,
almost all greenhouse gas mitigation and concentration
stabilization scenarios are characterized by the introduction
of efficient technologies for both energy use and supply, and
of low- or no-carbon energy. However, no single technology
option will provide all of the emissions reductions needed.
Reduction options in non-energy sources and non-CO,
greenhouse gases will also provide significant potential for
reducing emissions. Transfer of technologies between countries
and regions will widen the choice of options at the regional
level and economies of scale and learning will lower the costs
of their adoption (Sections 2.3.2, 2.4, 2.5).

"emissions. Substitution benefits can, in principle, continue
indefinitely. Appropriate management of land for crop, timber
and sustainable bio-energy production, may increase benefits
for climate change mitigation. Taking into account competition
for land use and the SAR and SRLULUCE assessments, the
estimated global potential of biological mitigation options is in
the order of 100GtC (cumulative), although there are substantial
uncertainties associated with this estimate, by 2050, equivalent
to about 10% to 20% of potential fossil fuel emissions during
that period. Realization of this potential depends upon land
and water availability as well as the rates of adoption of
different land management practices. The largest biological
potential for atmospheric carbon mitigation is in subtropical
and tropical regions. Cost estimates reported to date of
biological mitigation vary significantly from US$0.1/tC to about
US$20/tC in several tropical countries and from US$20/tC to
US$100/tC in non-tropical countries. Methods of financial
analysis and carbon accounting have not been comparable.
Moreover, the cost calculations do not cover, in many
instances, inter alia, costs for infrastructure, appropriate
discounting, monitoring, data collection and implementation
costs, opportunity costs of land and maintenance, or other
recurring costs, which are often excluded or overlooked. The
lower end of the ranges are biased downwards, but understanding
and treatment of costs is improving over time. These biological
mitigation options may have social, economic and environmental
benefits beyond reductions in atmospheric CO,, if implemented
appropriately. (e.g., biodiversity, watershed protection,
enhancement of sustainable land management and rural
employment). However, if implemented inappropriately, they
may pose risks of negative impacts (e.g., loss of biodiversity,
community disruption and ground-water pollution). Biological
mitigation options may reduce or increase non-CO, greenhouse
gas emissions (Sections 4.3, 4.4).

° Ancillary benefits are the ancillary, or side effects, of policies aimed
exclusively at climate change mitigation. Such policies have an impact

can also reduce private costs overall.

° Ancillary benefits. Climate change mitigation measures will
have effects on other societal issues. For example, reducing
carbon emissions in many cases will result in the
simultaneous reduction in local and regional air pollution.
It is likely that mitigation strategies will also affect
transportation, agriculture, land-use practices and waste
management and will have an impact on other issues of
social concern, such as employment, and energy security.
However, not all of the effects will be positive; careful
policy selection and design can better ensure positive
effects and minimize negative impacts. In some cases, the
magnitude of ancillary benefits of mitigation may be
comparable to the costs of the mitigating measures, adding
to the no regrets potential, although estimates are difficult
to make and vary widely (Sections 7.3.3, 8.2.4, 9.2.2-9.2.8,

finance reductions in existing distortionary taxes (“revenue
recycling”), these revenues reduce the economic cost of
achieving greenhouse gas reductions. The magnitude of
this offset depends on the existing tax structure, type of
tax cuts, labour market conditions, and method of recycling.

"15. Under any greenhouse gas mitigation effort, the economic
costs and benefits are distributed unevenly between sectors;
to a varying degree, the costs of mitigation actions could be
reduced by appropriate policies. In general, it is easier to
identify activities, which stand to suffer economic costs
compared to those which may benefit, and the economic costs
are more immediate, more concentrated and more certain.
Under mitigation policies, coal, possibly oil and gas, and
certain energy-intensive sectors, such as steel production, are
most likely to suffer an economic disadvantage. Other
industries including renewable energy industries and services
can be expected to benefit in the long term from price changes
and the availability of financial and other resources that would
otherwise have been devoted to carbon-intensive sectors.
Policies such as the removal of subsidies from fossil fuels
may increase total societal benefits through gains in economic
efficiency, while use of the Kyoto mechanisms could be
expected to reduce the net economic cost of meeting Annex
B targets. Other types of policies, for example exempting
carbon-intensive industries, redistribute the costs but increase
total societal costs at the same time. Most studies show that
the distributional effects of a carbon tax can have negative
income effects on low-income groups unless the tax revenues
are used directly or indirectly to compensate such effects
(Section 9.2.1).

20 These estimated costs can be expressed as differences in GDP growth rates
over the period 2000-2010. With no emissions trading, GDP growth rate
is reduced by 0.02 percentage points/year; with Annex B emissions trading,
growth rate is reduced by less than 0.005 percentage points/year.

2! These policies and measures include: those for non-CO, gases and non-
energy sources of all gases; offsets from sinks; industry restructuring
(e.g., from energy producer to supplier of energy services); use of
OPEC’s market power; and actions (e.g. of Annex B Parties) related
to funding, insurance, and the transfer of technology. In addition, the
studies typically do not include the following policies and effects that
can reduce the total cost of mitigation: the use of tax revenues to reduce
tax burdens or finance other mitigation measures; environmental ancillary
benefits of reductions in fossil fuel use; and induced technological change
from mitigation policies.

"17. The successful implementation of greenhouse gas mitigation
options needs to overcome many technical, economic, political,
cultural, social, behavioural and/or institutional barriers which
prevent the full exploitation of the technological, economic and
social opportunities of these mitigation options. The potential
mitigation opportunities and types of barriers vary by region
and sector, and over time. This is caused by the wide variation in
mitigation capacity. The poor in any country are faced with limited
opportunities to adopt technologies or change their social
behaviour, particularly if they are not part of a cash economy,
and most countries could benefit from innovative financing
and institutional reform and removing barriers to trade. In the
industrialized countries, future opportunities lie primarily in
removing social and behavioural barriers; in countries with
economies in transition, in price rationalization; and in developing
countries, in price rationalization, increased access to data and
information, availability of advanced technologies, financial
resources, and training and capacity building. Opportunities
for any given country, however, might be found in the removal
of any combination of barriers (Sections 1.5, 5.3, 5.4).

government spending and investment, and support for research

evaluation criteria, which may lead to different portfolios of
instruments. The literature in general gives no preference for
any particular policy instrument. Market based instruments
may be cost-effective in many cases, especially where capacity
to administer them is developed. Energy efficiency standards

GDP and reductions in projected oil revenues'®. The study
reporting the lowest costs shows reductions of 0.2% of
projected GDP with no emissions trading, and less than
0.05% of projected GDP with Annex B emissions trading
in 20107. The study reporting the highest costs shows
reductions of 25% of projected oil revenues with no emissions
trading, and 13% of projected oil revenues with Annex B
emissions trading in 2010. These studies do not consider
policies and measures”! other than Annex B emissions
trading, that could lessen the impact on non-Annex I, oil-
exporting countries, and therefore tend to overstate both
the costs to these countries and overall costs.
The effects on these countries can be further reduced by
removal of subsidies for fossil fuels, energy tax restructuring
according to carbon content, increased use of natural gas,
and diversification of the economies of non-Annex I, oil-
exporting countries.

° Other non-Annex I countries: They may be adversely
affected by reductions in demand for their exports to OECD
nations and by the price increase of those carbon-intensive

may benefit from the reduction in fuel prices, increased
exports of carbon-intensive products and the transfer of
environmentally sound technologies and know-how. The
net balance for a given country depends on which of these
factors dominates. Because of these complexities, the
breakdown of winners and losers remains uncertain.

studies completed since the SAR indicate that a gradual near-

a less carbon-emitting economy minimizes costs associated
with premature retirement of existing capital stock. It also

enhanced when climate policies are integrated with the non-
climate objectives of national and sectorial policy development
and be turned into broad transition strategies to achieve the
long-term social and technological changes required by both
sustainable development and climate change mitigation. Just
as climate policies can yield ancillary benefits that improve
wellbeing, non-climate policies may produce climate benefits.
It may be possible to significantly reduce greenhouse gas
emissions by pursuing climate objectives through general socio-
economic policies. In many countries, the carbon intensity of
energy systems may vary depending on broader programmmes
for energy infrastructure development, pricing, and tax policies.
Adopting state-of-the-art environmentally sound technologies
may offer particular opportunity for environmentally sound
development while avoiding greenhouse gas intensive
activities. Specific attention can foster the transfer of those
technologies to small and medium size enterprises. Moreover,
taking ancillary benefits into account in comprehensive national
development strategies can lower political and institutional
barriers for climate-specific actions (Sections 2.2.3, 2.4.4,

area of mitigation of climate change, which was partly
influenced by political changes such as the adoption of the
Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1997, has been undertaken
and is reported on here. The report also draws on a number of
IPCC Special Reports! and IPCC co-sponsored meetings and

Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was charged by the IPCC
Plenary for the Panel’s Third Assessment Report (TAR) to
assess the scientific, technical, environmental, economic, and
social aspects of the mitigation of climate change. Thus, the
mandate of the Working Group was changed from a
predominantly disciplinary assessment of the economic and
social dimensions on climate change (including adaptation)
in the Second Assessment Report (SAR), to an interdisciplinary
assessment of the options to control the emissions of
greenhouse gases (GHGs) and/or enhance their sinks.

"This chapter places climate change mitigation, mitigation
policy, and the contents of the rest of the report in the broader
context of development, equity, and sustainability. This context
reflects the explicit conditions and principles laid down by
the UNFCCC on the pursuit of the ultimate objective of stabilizing
greenhouse gas concentrations. The UNFCCC imposes three
conditions on the goal of stabilization: namely that it should
take place within a time-frame sufficient to “allow ecosystems
to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production
is not threatened and to enable economic development to
proceed in a sustainable manner” (Art. 2). It also specifies
several principles to guide this process: equity, common but
differentiated responsibilities, precaution, cost-effective measures,
right to sustainable development, and support for an open
international economic system (Art. 3).

"Climate change involves complex interactions between climatic,
environmental, economic, political, institutional, social, and
technological processes. It cannot be addressed or comprehended
in isolation of broader societal goals (such as equity or sustainable
development), or other existing or probable future sources of
stress. In keeping with this complexity, a multiplicity of approaches
have emerged to analyze climate change and related challenges.
Many of these incorporate concerns about development, equity,
and sustainability (DES) (albeit partially and gradually) into
their framework and recommendations. Each approach
emphasizes certain elements of the problem, and focuses on
certain classes of responses, including for example, optimal
policy design, building capacity for designing and implementing
policies, strengthening synergies between climate change
mitigation and/or adaptation and other societal goals, and
policies to enhance societal learning. These approaches are
therefore complementary rather than mutually exclusive.
"	Text
"This chapter brings together three broad classes of analysis,
which differ not so much in terms of their ultimate goals as of
their points of departure and preferred analytical tools. The
three approaches start with concerns, respectively, about
efficiency and cost-effectiveness, equity and sustainable
development, and global sustainability and societal learning.
The difference between the three approaches selected lies in
their starting point not in their ultimate goals. Regardless of
the starting point of the analysis, many studies try in their own
way to incorporate other concerns. For example, many analyses
that approach climate change mitigation from a cost-
effectiveness perspective try to bring in considerations of equity
and sustainability through their treatment of costs, benefits, and
welfare. Similarly, the class of studies that are motivated strongly
by considerations of inter-country equity tend to argue that
equity is needed to ensure that developing countries can pursue
their internal goals of sustainable development—a concept that
includes the implicit components of sustainability and efficiency.
Likewise, analysts focused on concerns of global sustainability
have been compelled by their own logic to make a case for
global efficiency—often modelled as the decoupling of production
from material flows—and social equity. In other words, each
of the three perspectives has led writers to search for ways to
incorporate concerns that lie beyond their initial starting point.
All three classes of analyses look at the relationship of climate
change mitigation with all three goals-development, equity, and
sustainability—albeit in different and often highly complementary

"There is no presumption that any particular perspective for analysis
is most appropriate at any level. Moreover, the three perspectives
are viewed here as being highly synergistic. The important changes
have been primarily in the types of questions being asked and
the kinds of information being sought. In practice, the literature
has expanded to add new issues and new tools, subsuming rather
than discarding the analyses included in the other perspectives.
The range and scope of climate policy analyses can be understood
as a gradual broadening of the types and extent of uncertainties
that analysts have been willing and able to address.

"Extending discussions of how nations might respond to the
mitigation challenge so that they include issues of cost-effectiveness
and efficiency, distribution narrowly defined, equity more broadly
defined, and sustainability, adds enormous complexity to the
problem of uncovering how best to respond to the threat of climate
change. Indeed, recognizing that these multiple domains are
relevant complicates the task assigned to policymakers and
international negotiators by opening their deliberations to issues
that lie beyond the boundaries of the climate change problem,
per se. Their recognition thereby underlines the importance of
integrating scientific thought across a wide range of new policy-
relevant contexts, but not simply because of some abstract
academic or narrow parochial interest advanced by a small
set of researchers or nations. Cost-effectiveness, equity, and
sustainability have all been identified as critical issues by the

"The third perspective is global sustainability and societal learning.
While sustainability has been incorporated in the analyses in
a number of ways, a class of studies takes the issue of global
sustainability as their point of departure. These studies focus
on alternative pathways to pursue global sustainability and
address issues like decoupling growth from resource flows,
for example through eco-intelligent production systems,
resource light infrastructure and appropriate technologies, and
decoupling wellbeing from production, for example through
intermediate performance levels, regionalization of production
systems, and changing lifestyles. One popular method for
identifying constraints and opportunities within this perspective
is to identify future sustainable states and then examine possible
transition paths to those states for feasibility and desirability.
In the case of developing countries this leads to a number of
possible strategies that can depart significantly from those
which the developed countries pursued in the past.
"	Text
"The impetus for the expansion in the scope of the climate policy
analysis and discourse to include equity considerations was to
address not simply the impacts of climate change and mitigation
policies on global welfare as a whole, but also of the effects of
climate change and mitigation policies on existing inequalities
among and within nations. The literature on equity and climate
change has advanced considerably over the last two decades,
but there is no consensus on what constitutes fairness. Once equity
issues were introduced into the assessment agenda, though,
they became important components in defining the search for
efficient emissions mitigation pathways. The considerable
literature that indicated how environmental policies could be
hampered or even blocked by those who considered them unfair
became relevant. In light of these results, it became clear how
and why any widespread perception that a mitigation strategy
is unfair would likely engender opposition to that strategy, perhaps
to the extent of rendering it non-optimal (or even infeasible, as
could be the case if non-Annex I countries never participate).
Some cost-effectiveness analyses had, in fact, laid the groundwork
"	Text
"for applying this literature by demonstrating the sensitivity of
some equity measures to policy design, national perspective,
and regional context. Indeed, cost-effectiveness analyses had even
highlighted similar sensitivities for other measures of development
and sustainability. As mentioned, the analyses that start from
equity concerns have by and large focused on the needs of
developing countries, and in particular on the commitment
expressed in Article 3.4 of the UNFCCC to the pursuit of
sustainable development. Countries differ in ways that have
dramatic implications for scenario baselines and the range of
mitigation options that can be considered. The climate policies
that are feasible, and/or desirable, in a particular country depend
significantly on its available resources and institutions, and on
its overall objectives including climate change as but one
component. Recognizing this heterogeneity may, thus, lead to
a different range of policy options than has been considered
likely thus far and may reveal differences in the capacities of
different sectors that may also enhance appreciation of what
can be done by non-state actors to improve their ability to mitigate.
"	Text
"The first perspective on climate policy analysis is cost
effectiveness. It represents the field of conventional climate
policy analysis that is well represented in the First through
Third Assessments. These analyses have generally been driven
directly or indirectly by the question of what is the most cost-
effective amount of mitigation for the global economy starting
from a particular baseline GHG emissions projection, reflecting
a specific set of socio-economic projections. Within this
framework, important issues include measuring the performance
of various technologies and the removal of barriers (such as
existing subsidies) to the implementation of those candidate
policies most likely to contribute to emissions reductions. In
a sense, the focus of analysis here has been on identifying an
efficient pathway through the interactions of mitigation policies
and economic development, conditioned by considerations of
equity and sustainability, but not primarily guided by them. At
this level, policy analysis has almost always taken the existing
institutions and tastes of individuals as given; assumptions
that might be valid for a decade or two, but may become more
questionable over many decades.

whose benefits such as reduced energy costs and reduced emissions of local/
regional pollutants equal or exceed their costs to society, excluding the benefits
of avoided climate change. They are also known as negative cost options.

3 In this report sometimes the term “co-benefits” is also used to indicate the
additional benefits of policy options that are implemented for various
reasons at the same time, acknowledging that most policies designed to
address GHG mitigation also have other, often at least equally important,
rationales, e.g., related to objectives of development, sustainability and
equity. The benefits of avoided climate change are not covered in ancillary
or co-benefits. See also Section 7.2.

"Each mitigation scenario describes a particular future world, with
particular economic, social, and environmental characteristics,
and they therefore implicitly or explicitly contain information
about DES. Since the difference between reference case
scenarios and stabilization and mitigation scenarios is simply
the addition of deliberate climate policy, it can be the case
that the differences in emissions among different reference
case scenarios are greater than those between any one such
scenario and its stabilization or mitigation version.
"	Text
"In order to be effective, however, a portfolio approach requires
weighing the costs and impacts of the broader set of policies
according to a longer list of objectives. Climate deliberations
need to consider the climate ramifications of policies designed
primarily to address a wide range of issues including DES, as
well as the likely impacts of climate policies on the achievement
of these objectives. As part of this process the opportunity
costs and impacts of each instrument are measured against the
multiple criteria defined by these multiple objectives. Furthermore,
the number of decision makers or stakeholders to be considered
is increased beyond national policymakers and international
negotiators to include state, local, community, and household
agents, as well as non-government organizations (NGOs).
"	Text
"The literature being brought to bear on climate change
mitigation increasingly shows that policies lying beyond simply
reducing GHG emissions from a specified baseline to minimize
costs can be extremely effective in abating the emission of
GHGs. Therefore, a portfolio approach to policy and analysis
would be more effective than exclusive reliance on a narrow
set of policy instruments or analytical tools. Besides the
flexibility that an expanded range of policy instruments and
analytical tools can provide to policymakers for achieving
climate objectives, the explicit inclusion of additional policy
objectives also increases the likelihood of “buy-in” to climate
policies by more participants. In particular, it will expand the
range of no regrets? options. Finally, it could assist in tailoring
policies to short-, medium-, and long-term goals.
"	Text
"“mitigative capacity” is also introduced as a possible way to
integrate results derived from the application of the three
perspectives in the future. The determinants of the capacity to
mitigate climate change include the availability of technological
and policy options, and access to resources to underwrite
undertaking those options. These determinants are the focus
of much of the TAR. The list of determinants is, however,
longer than this. Mitigative capacity also depends upon nation-
specific characteristics that facilitate the pursuit of sustainable
development — e.g., the distribution of resources, the relative
empowerment of various segments of the population, the
credibility of empowered decision makers, the degree to which
climate objectives complement other objectives, access to
credible information and analyses, the will to act on that
information, the ability to spread risk intra- and inter-
generationally, and so on. Given that the determinants of
mitigative capacity are essentially the same as those of the
analogous concept of adaptive capacity introduced in the WGII
Report, this approach may provide an integrated framework
for assessing both sets of options.

will require emissions reductions in Annex I countries after
2012 that go significantly beyond their Kyoto Protocol

to go much beyond the Kyoto commitments for Annex I by
2020 to achieve stabilization at SSOppmv or higher. However,
it should be recognized that several scenarios indicate the need
for significant Annex I emission reductions by 2020 and that

"Assumed mitigation options differ among scenarios and are

features of mitigation scenarios include large and continuous

low-carbon energy, especially biomass over the next 100 years

conservation and reforestation are reasonable first steps, but
innovative supply-side technologies will eventually be required.
Possible robust options include using natural gas and combined-

"efficiency opportunities for buildings, industry, transportation,

end-use sectors, by switching to natural gas in the electric

from industry, e.g., N,O, perfluoromethane (CF,), and HFCs.
By the year 2020, when a proportion of the existing power plants
will have been replaced in developed countries and countries
with economies in transition (EITs), and when many new plants
will become operational in developing countries, the use of
renewable sources of energy can begin contributing to the

"Running counter to the technological and economic potential
for GHG emissions reduction are rapid economic development
and accelerating change in some socio-economic and
behavioural trends that are increasing total energy use,
especially in developed countries and high-income groups in
developing countries. Dwelling units and vehicles in many
countries are growing in size, and the intensity of electrical
appliance use is increasing. Use of electrical office equipment
in commercial buildings is increasing. In developed countries,
and especially the USA, sales of larger, heavier, and less
efficient vehicles are also increasing. Continued reduction or
stabilization in retail energy prices throughout large portions
of the world reduces incentives for the efficient use of energy
or the purchase of energy efficient technologies in all sectors.
With a few important exceptions, countries have made little
effort to revitalize policies or programmes to increase energy
efficiency or promote renewable energy technologies. Also
since the early 1990s, there has been a reduction in both public
and private resources devoted to R&D (research and

"Technologies and practices to reduce GHG emissions are
continuously being developed. Many of these technologies
focus on improving the efficiency of fossil fuel energy or
electricity use and the development of low carbon energy
sources, since the majority of GHG emissions (in terms of
CO, equivalents) are related to the use of energy. Energy
intensity (energy consumed divided by gross domestic product
(GDP)) and carbon intensity (CO, emitted from burning fossil
fuels divided by the amount of energy produced) have been
declining for more than 100 years in developed countries
without explicit government policies for decarbonization, and
have the potential to decline further. Much of this change is
the result of a shift away from high carbon fuels such as coal
towards oil and natural gas, through energy conversion efficiency
improvements and the introduction of hydro and nuclear
power. Other non-fossil fuel energy sources are also being
developed and rapidly implemented and have a significant
potential for reducing GHG emissions. Biological sequestration
of CO, and CO, removal and storage can also play a role in
reducing GHG emissions in the future (see also Section 4
below). Other technologies and measures focus on the non-
energy sectors for reducing emissions of the remaining major
GHGs: CH4, nitrous oxide (NO), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs),
perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulphur hexafluoride (SF,).

"The buildings sector contributed 31% of global energy-related
CO, emissions in 1995, and these emissions have grown at an
annual rate of 1.8% since 1971. Building technology has continued
onan evolutionary trajectory with incremental gains during the
past five years in the energy efficiency of windows, lighting,
appliances, insulation, space heating, refrigeration, and air
conditioning. There has also been continued development of
building controls, passive solar design, integrated building design,
and the application of photovoltaic systems in buildings.
Fluorocarbon emissions from refrigeration and air conditioning
applications have declined as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) have
been phased out, primarily thanks to improved containment and
recovery of the fluorocarbon refrigerant and, to a lesser extent,
owing to the use of hydrocarbons and other non-fluorocarbon
refrigerants. Fluorocarbon use and emission from insulating foams
have declined as CFCs have been phased out, and are projected
to decline further as HCFCs are phased out. R&D effort has led
to increased efficiency of refrigerators and cooling and heating
systems. In spite of the continued improvement in technology
and the adoption of improved technology in many countries,
energy use in buildings has grown more rapidly than total energy
demand from 1971 through 1995, with commercial building
energy registering the greatest annual percentage growth (3.0%
compared to 2.2% in residential buildings). This is largely a
result of the increased amenity that consumers demand — in
terms of increased use of appliances, larger dwellings, and the
modernization and expansion of the commercial sector — as
economies grow. There presently exist significant cost-effective
technological opportunities to slow this trend. The overall
technical potential for reducing energy-related CO, emissions
in the buildings sector using existing technologies combined
with future technical advances is 715MtC/yr in 2010 for a base
case with carbon emissions of 2,600MtC/yr (27%), 9SOMtC/yr
in 2020 for a base case with carbon emissions of 3,000MtC/yr
(31%), and 2,025MtC/yr in 2050 for a base case with carbon
emissions of 3,900MtC/yr (52%). Expanded R&D can assure
continued technology improvement in this sector.

Buildings, households and services: Hundreds of
technologies and measures exist that can improve
the energy efficiency of appliances and equipment
as well as building structures in all regions of the
world. It is estimated that CO, emissions from
residential buildings in 2010 can be reduced by
325MtC in developed countries and the EIT region
at costs ranging from —US$ 250 to -US$ 150/tC
and by 125MtC in developing countries at costs of
—US$ 250 to US$ 50/tC. Similarly, CO, emissions
from commercial buildings in 2010 can be reduced
by 185MtC in industrialized countries and the EIT
region at costs ranging from —US$ 400 to -US$
250/tC and by 80MtC in developing countries at
costs ranging from —US$ 400 to US$ O/C. These
savings represent almost 30% of buildings, CO,

scenario such as the SRES B2 Marker scenario.

Transportation: Transportation technology for
light-duty vehicles has advanced more rapidly
than anticipated in the SAR, as a consequence of
international R& D efforts. Hybrid-electric vehicles
have already appeared in the market and introduction
of fuel cell vehicles by 2003 has been announced by
most major manufacturers. The GHG mitigation
impacts of technological efficiency improvements
will be diminished to some extent by the rebound
effect, unless counteracted by policies that effectively
increase the price of fuel or travel. In countries
with high fuel prices, such as Europe, the rebound
effect may be as large as 40%; in countries with
low fuel prices, such as the USA, the rebound
appears to be no larger than 20%. Taking into
account rebound effects, technological measures
can reduce GHG emissions by 5%-15% by 2010
and 15%-35% by 2020, in comparison to a
baseline of continued growth.
"	Text
" 

Opportunities: Information technologies are
creating new opportunities for pricing some of the
external costs of transportation, from congestion
to environmental pollution. Implementation of more
efficient pricing can provide greater incentives for
energy efficiency in both equipment and modal
structure. The factors that hinder the adoption of fuel-
efficient technologies in transport vehicle markets
create conditions under which energy efficiency
regulations, voluntary or mandatory, can be effective.
Well-formulated regulations eliminate much of the risk
of making sweeping technological changes, because
all competitors face the same regulations. Study after
study has demonstrated the existence of technologies
capable of reducing vehicle carbon intensities by
up to 50% or in the longer run 100%, approximately
cost-effectively. Finally, intensive R&D efforts for
light-duty road vehicles have achieved dramatic
improvements in hybrid power-train and fuel cell
technologies. Similar efforts could be directed at road
freight, air, rail, and marine transport technologies,
with potentially dramatic pay-offs.

Barriers: Risk to manufacturers of transportation
equipment is an important barrier to more rapid
adoption of energy efficient technologies in transport.
Achieving significant energy efficiency improvements
generally requires a “clean sheet” redesign of vehicles,
along with multibillion dollar investments in new
production facilities. On the other hand, the value of
greater efficiency to customers is the difference between
the present value of fuel savings and increased purchase
price, which net can often be a small quantity. Although
markets for transport vehicles are dominated by a very
small number of companies in the technical sense,
they are nonetheless highly competitive in the sense
that strategic errors can be very costly. Finally, many
of the benefits of increased energy efficiency accrue
in the form of social rather than private benefits. For
all these reasons, the risk to manufacturers of sweeping
technological change to improve energy efficiency
is generally perceived to outweigh the direct market
benefits. Enormous public and private investments
in transportation infrastructure and a built environment
adapted to motor vehicle travel pose significant barriers
to changing the modal structure of transportation
in many countries.

Barriers: to mitigation in land-use change and
forestry include lack of funding and of human and
institutional capacity to monitor and verify, social
constraints such as food supply, people living off the
natural forest, incentives for land clearing, population

for meat. In tropical countries, forestry activities are
often dominated by the state forest departments with

sector. In some parts of the tropical world, particularly
Africa, low crop productivity and competing demands
on forests for crop production and fuelwood are
likely to reduce mitigation opportunities.

Land-use change and forestry: There are three
fundamental ways in which land use or management
can mitigate atmospheric CO, increases: protection,
sequestration, and substitutiona. These options show
different temporal patterns; consequently, the
choice of options and their potential effectiveness
depend on the target time frame as well as on site
productivity and disturbance history. The SAR
estimated that globally these measures could reduce
atmospheric C by about 83 to 131GtC by 2050
(60 to 87GtC in forests and 23 to 44GtC in
agricultural soils). Studies published since then
have not substantially revised these estimates. The
costs of terrestrial management practices are quite
low compared to alternatives, and range from 0
(‘win-win' opportunities) to US$12/AC.

Agriculture and waste management: Energy
inputs are growing by <1% per year globally with
the highest increases in non-OECD countries but
they have reduced in the EITs. Several options already
exist to decrease GHG emissions for investments of
—US$ 50 to 150/tC. These include increasing
carbon stock by cropland management (125MtC/
yr by 2010); reducing CH, emissions from better
livestock management (>30MtC/yr) and rice
production (7MtC/yr); soil carbon sequestration (50-
100MtC/yr) and reducing N,O emissions from
animal wastes and application of N measures are
feasible in most regions given appropriate
technology transfer and incentives for farmers to
change their traditional methods. Energy cropping
to displace fossil fuels has good prospects if the
costs can be made more competitive and the crops
are produced sustainably. Improved waste
management can decrease GHG emissions by
200MtC,, in 2010 and 320MtC,, in 2020 as

Halocarbons: Emissions of HFCs are growing as
HFCs are being used to replace some of the ozone-
depleting substances being phased out. Compared
to SRES projections for HFCs in 2010, itis estimated
that emissions could be lower by as much as
100MIC.,, at costs below US$ 200/tC,,. About half
of the estimated reduction is an artifact caused by

Energy sector: In the energy sector, options are

GHGs per unit of energy produced, by sequestering
carbon, and reducing GHG leakages. Win-win
options such as coal bed methane recovery and
improved energy efficiency in coal and gas fired
power generation as well as co-production of heat
and electricity can help to reduce emissions. With
economic development continuing, efficiency
increases alone will be insufficient to control GHG
emissions from the energy sector. Options to decrease
emissions per unit energy produced include new
renewable forms of energy, which are showing strong
growth but still account for less than 1% of energy

been proposed and could contribute significantly at
costs competitive with renewable energy although
considerable research is still needed on the feasibility

in this sector to reduce CO, emissions to 2020 from new power
plants. CCGTs are expected to be the largest provider of new
capacity between now and 2020 worldwide, and will be a strong
competitor to displace new coal-fired power stations where
additional gas supplies can be made available. Nuclear power
has the potential to reduce emissions if it becomes politically
acceptable, as it can replace both coal and gas for electricity
production. Biomass, based mainly on wastes and agricultural
and forestry by-products, and wind power are also potentially
capable of making major contributions by 2020. Hydropower
is an established technology and further opportunities exist beyond
those anticipated to contribute to reducing CO, equivalent
emissions. Finally, while costs of solar power are expected to decline
substantially, it is likely to remain an expensive option by 2020
for central power generation, but it is likely to make increased
contributions in niche markets and off-grid generation. The best
mitigation option is likely to be dependent on local circumstances,

"Carbon reservoirs in most ecosystems eventually approach some
maximum level. The total amount of carbon stored and/or
carbon emission avoided by a forest management project at
any given time is dependent on the specific management
practices (see Figure TS-6). Thus, an ecosystem depleted of
carbon by past events may have a high potential rate of carbon
accumulation, while one with a large carbon pool tends to
have a low rate of carbon sequestration. As ecosystems eventually
approach their maximum carbon pool, the sink (i.e., the rate
of change of the pool) will diminish. Although both the
sequestration rate and pool of carbon may be relatively high
at some stages, they cannot be maximized simultaneously.
Thus, management strategies for an ecosystem may depend
on whether the goal is to enhance short-term accumulation or
to maintain the carbon reservoirs through time. The ecologically
achievable balance between the two goals is constrained by
disturbance history, site productivity, and target time frame.

half of the total emission reduction potential of these sectors.
Efficiency improvements in material use (including recycling)
will also become more important in the longer term. The energy
supply and conversion sector will remain dominated by cheap
and abundant fossil fuels. However, there is significant
emission reduction potential thanks to a shift from coal to
natural gas, conversion efficiency improvement of power
plants, the expansion of distributed co-generation plants in
industry, commercial buildings and institutions, and CO,
recovery and sequestration. The continued use of nuclear
power plants (including their lifetime extension), and the
application of renewable energy sources could avoid some
additional emissions from fossil fuel use. Biomass from by-
products and wastes such as landfill gas are potentially
important energy sources that can be supplemented by energy
crop production where suitable land and water are available.
Wind energy and hydropower will also contribute, more so
than solar energy because of its relatively high costs. N,O and
fluorinated GHG reductions have already been achieved
through major technological advances. Process changes,
improved containment and recovery, and the use of alternative
compounds and technologies have been implemented.
Potential for future reductions exists, including process-related
emissions from insulated foam and semiconductor production

potential for energy efficiency improvements connected to the
use of fluorinated gases is of a similar magnitude to reductions
of direct emissions. Soil carbon sequestration, enteric CH,

Europe. Regrowth restores carbon to the forest and the (hypothetical) forest stand is harvested every 40 years, with some litter left on the
ground to decay, and products accumulate or are disposed of in landfills. These are net changes in that, for example, the diagram shows

strategies with other land uses may be competitive, neutral, or

comprehensive strategies aimed at sustainable development,
where increasing C stocks is but one of many objectives. Often,
measures can be adopted within forestry, agriculture, and other
land uses to provide C mitigation and, at the same time, also
advance other social, economic, and environmental goals.
Carbon mitigation can provide additional value and income

"In the past, land management has often resulted in reduced C
pools, but in many regions like Western Europe, C pools have
now stabilized and are recovering. In most countries in temperate
and boreal regions forests are expanding, although current C pools
are still smaller than those in pre-industrial or pre-historic times.
While complete recovery of pre-historic C pools is unlikely, there
is potential for substantial increases in carbon stocks. The Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the UN Economic
Commission for Europe (ECE)’s statistics suggest that the average
net annual increment exceeded timber fellings in managed boreal
and temperate forests in the early 1990s. For example, C stocks
in live tree biomass have increased by 0.17GtC/yr in the USA
and 0.11GtC/yr in Western Europe, absorbing about 10% of
global fossil CO, emissions for that time period. Though these
estimates do not include changes in litter and soils, they
illustrate that land surfaces play a significant and changing role
in the atmospheric carbon budget. Enhancing these carbon pools
provides potentially powerful opportunities for climate mitigation.

"Most studies suggest that the economic costs of some
biological carbon mitigation options, particularly forestry
options, are quite modest through a range. Cost estimates of
biological mitigation reported to date vary significantly from
US$0.1/tC to about US$20/tC in several tropical countries
and from US$20 to US$100/tC in non-tropical countries.
Moreover the cost calculations do not cover, in many instances,
inter alia, costs for infrastructure, appropriate discounting,
monitoring, data collection and interpretation, and opportunity
costs of land and maintenance, or other recurring costs, which
are often excluded or overlooked. The lower end of the ranges
are biased downwards, but understanding and treatment of
costs is improving over time. Furthermore, in many cases
biological mitigation activities may have other positive
impacts, such as protecting tropical forests or creating new
forests with positive external environmental effects. However,
costs rise as more biological mitigation options are exercised
and as the opportunity costs of the land increases. Biological
mitigation costs appear to be lowest in developing countries
and higher in developed countries. If biological mitigation
activities are modest, leakage is likely to be small. However,
the amount of leakage could rise if biological mitigation
activities became large and widespread.

only insofar as existing environmental regulations or policies
internalize these effects and thereby impose them on consumers.
Broader impacts might be ignored by consumers, and hence
not enter into the determination of economic potential, but
they would be incorporated into a social cost-effectiveness
calculation. Thus, to the extent that other environmental benefits

preferences and other social and cultural barriers to the diffusion
of new technology. That is, even if market and institutional barriers
are removed, some GHG-mitigating technologies may not be
widely used simply because people do not like them, are too
poor to afford them, or because existing social and cultural forces
operate against their acceptance. If, in addition to overcoming
market and institutional barriers, this second group of barriers
could be overcome, what is labelled as the “socio-economic

"The transfer of technologies and practices that have the
potential to reduce GHG emissions is often hampered by barriers’?
that slow their penetration. The opportunity"" to mitigate GHG
concentrations by removing or modifying barriers to or otherwise
accelerating the spread of technology may be viewed within a
framework of different potentials for GHG mitigation (Figure
TS-7). Starting at the bottom, one can imagine addressing
barriers (often referred to as market failures) that relate to
markets, public policies, and other institutions that inhibit the
diffusion of technologies that are (or are projected to be) cost-
effective for users without reference to any GHG benefits they
may generate. Amelioration of this class of “market and
institutional imperfections” would increase GHG mitigation
towards the level that is labelled as the “economic potential”.
The economic potential represents the level of GHG mitigation

"Distorted or incomplete prices are also important barriers.
The absence of a market price for certain impacts (externalities),
such as environmental harm, constitutes a barrier to the
diffusion of environmentally beneficial technologies.
Distortion of prices because of taxes, subsidies, or other policy
interventions that make resource consumption more or less
expensive to consumers also impedes the diffusion of resource-
conserving technologies.

"Uncertainty: Another important barrier is uncertainty. A consumer
may be uncertain about future energy prices and, therefore, future
energy savings. Also, there may be uncertainty about the next
generation of equipment — will next year bring a cheaper or better

with the issue of sunk cost and long lifetimes of infrastructure,
and the associated irreversibilities of investments of the non-
fungible infrastructure capita.

"Information is often considered as a public good. Generic
information regarding the availability of different kinds of
technologies and their performance characteristics may have the
attributes of a “public good” and hence may be underprovided
by the private market. This problem is exacerbated by the fact
that even after a technology is in place and being used, it is
often difficult to quantify the energy savings that resulted from
its installation owing to measurement errors and the difficulty
with baseline problems. Knowing that this uncertainty will
prevail can itself inhibit technology diffusion.

"In some situations policy development is based on a model of
human psychology that has been widely criticized. People are
assumed to be rational welfare-maximizers and to have a fixed
set of values. Such a model does not explain processes, such
as learning, habituation, value formation, or the bounded
rationality, observed in human choice. Social structures can
affect consumption, for example, through the association of
objects with status and class. Individuals’ adoption of more
sustainable consumption patterns depends not only on the
match between those patterns and their perceived needs, but
also on the extent to which they understand their consumption
options, and are able to make choices.

Capital is used for competing investment priorities, and is subject
to high hurdle rates for energy efficiency investments. Lack

Like a tax, a tradable permit system poses a number of design

sources included, point of compliance, and use of banking.
To be able to cover all sources with a single domestic permit
regime is unlikely. The certainty provided by a tradable permit
system of achieving a given emissions level for participating
sources comes at the cost of the uncertainty of permit prices

"The economics literature on the choice of policies adopted

and who ultimately decide which instruments or mix of
instruments will be used. However, the point of compliance
of alternative policy instruments, whether they are applied to
fossil fuel users or manufacturers, for example, is likely to be
politically crucial to the choice of policy instrument. And a
key insight is that some forms of regulation actually can benefit
the regulated industry, for example, by limiting entry into the
industry or imposing higher costs on new entrants. A policy
that imposes costs on industry as a whole might still be supported
by firms who would fare better than their competitors. Regulated
firms, of course, are not the only group with a stake in regulation:

"Market-based instruments — principally domestic taxes and
domestic tradable permit systems — will be attractive to
governments in many cases because they are efficient. They
will frequently be introduced in concert with conventional
regulatory measures. When implementing a domestic emissions
tax, policymakers must consider the collection point, the tax
base, the variation among sectors, the association with trade,
employment, revenue, and the exact form of the mechanism.
Each of these can influence the appropriate design of a
domestic emissions tax, and political or other concerns are
likely to play a role as well. For example, a tax levied on the
energy content of fuels could be much more costly than a
carbon tax for equivalent emissions reduction, because an
energy tax raises the price of all forms of energy, regardless
of their contribution to CO, emissions. Yet, many nations may
choose to use energy taxes for reasons other than cost
effectiveness, and much of the analysis in this section applies

tend to lead to positive marginal and positive total mitigation costs.
In each case, the interaction of these abatement costs with the
existing tax structure and, more generally, with existing factor
prices is important. Price-based policies that generate revenues can
be coupled with measures to improve market efficiency. However,
the role of non-price policies, which affect the sign of the change

conduct taken in compliance with obligations they impose and the
expanding legal regime under the WTO and/or GATT umbrella.
Neither the UNFCCC nor the Kyoto Protocol now provides for

"Turning to international policies and measures, the Kyoto Protocol
defines three international policy instruments, the so-called
Kyoto mechanisms: international emissions trading (IET), joint

opportunities for Annex I Parties to fulfil their commitments
cost-effectively. IET essentially would allow Annex I Parties
to exchange part of their assigned national emission allowances
(targets). IET implies that countries with high marginal abatement
costs (MACs) may acquire emission reductions from countries
with low MACs. Similarly, JI would allow Annex I Parties to
exchange emission reduction units among themselves on a
project-by-project basis. Under the CDM, Annex I Parties
would receive credit —- on a project-by-project basis — for
reductions accomplished in non-Annex I countries.

"In the case of JI, host governments have incentives to ensure
that emission reduction units (ERUs) are issued only for real
emission reductions, assuming that they face strong penalties for
non-compliance with national emissions limitation commitments.
In the case of CDM, a process for independent certification of
emission reductions is crucial, because host governments do
not have emissions limitation commitments and hence may
have less incentive to ensure that certified emission reductions
(CERs) are issued only for real emission reductions. The main
difficulty in implementing project-based mechanisms, both JI
and CDM, is determining the net additional emission reduction
(or sink enhancement) achieved; baseline definition may be
extremely complex. Various other aspects of these Kyoto
mechanisms are awaiting further decision making, including:
monitoring and verification procedures, financial additionality
(assurance that CDM projects will not displace traditional
development assistance flows), and possible means of

results and leaves as much flexibility as possible in the
choice of how to achieve the results.

Voluntary agreements (VAs) may take a variety of forms.
Proponents of VAs point to low transaction costs and
consensus elements, while sceptics emphasize the risk of
“free riding”, and the risk that the private sector will not
pursue real emissions reduction in the absence of monitoring

Some objectives in mitigation policies can be specified in
economic units (e.g., costs and benefits measured in monetary

"A frequent criticism of this costing method is that it is inequitable,
as it gives greater weight to the “well off’. This is because, typically,
a well-off person has a greater WTP or WTA than a less well-off
person and hence the choices made reflect more the preferences
of the better off. This criticism is valid, but there is no coherent
and consistent method of valuation that can replace the existing
one in its entirety. Concerns about, for example, equity can be
addressed along with the basic cost estimation. The estimated
costs are one piece of information in the decision-making
process for climate change that can be supplemented with other
information on other social objectives, for example impacts on
key stakeholders and the meeting of poverty objectives.

"Policies aimed at mitigating GHGs, as stated earlier, can yield

apparent that the actual magnitude of the ancillary benefits or
co-benefits assessed critically depends on the scenario
structure of the analysis, in particular on the assumptions about
policy management in the baseline case. This implies that
whether a particular impact is included or not depends on the
primary objective of the programme. Moreover, something that
is seen as a GHG reduction programme from an international
perspective may be seen, from a national perspective, as one
in which local pollutants and GHGs are equally important.

"This section addresses the methodological issues that arise in
the estimation of the monetary costs of climate change. The
focus is on the correct assessment of the costs of mitigation
measures to reduce the emissions of GHGs. The assessment
of costs and benefits should be based on a systematic analytical
framework to ensure comparability and transparency of
estimates. One well-developed framework assesses costs as
changes in social welfare based on individual values. These
individual values are reflected by the willingness to pay (WTP)
for environmental improvements or the willingness to accept
(WTA) compensation. From these value measures can be
derived measures such as the social surpluses gained or lost
from a policy, the total resource costs, and opportunity costs.

"The literature uses a number of terms to depict the associated

benefits, secondary benefits, collateral benefits, and associated

to the non-climate benefits of GHG mitigation policies that
are explicitly incorporated into the initial creation of mitigation
policies. Thus, the term co-benefits reflects that most policies
designed to address GHG mitigation also have other, often at
least equally important, rationales involved at the inception
of these policies (e.g., related to objectives of development,
sustainability, and equity). In contrast, the term ancillary
benefits connotes those secondary or side effects of climate
change mitigation policies on problems that arise subsequent
to any proposed GHG mitigation policies.

"While most people appreciate that adaptation choices affect the
costs of mitigation, this obvious point is often not addressed in
climate policymaking. Policy is fragmented - with mitigation being
seen as addressing climate change and adaptation seen as a means
of reacting to natural hazards. Usually mitigation and adaptation
are modelled separately as a necessary simplification to gain
traction on an immense and complex issue. As a consequence,
the costs of risk reduction action are frequently estimated
separately, and therefore each measure is potentially biased.
This realization suggests that more attention to the interaction
of mitigation and adaptation, and its empirical ramification,
is worthwhile, though uncertainty about the nature and timing
of impacts, including surprises, will constrain the extent to
which the associated costs can be fully internalized.

"There are broadly two approaches to discounting—an ethical
or prescriptive approach based on what rates of discount should
be applied, and a descriptive approach based on what rates of
discount people (savers as well as investors) actually apply in
their day-to-day decisions. For mitigation analysis, the country
must base its decisions at least partly on discount rates that
reflect the opportunity cost of capital. Rates that range from
4% to 6% would probably be justified in developed countries.
The rate could be 10-12% or even higher in developing countries.
Itis more of a challenge to argue that climate change mitigation
projects should face different rates, unless the mitigation
project is of very long duration. The literature shows increasing
attention to rates that decline over time and hence give more
weight to benefits that occur in the long term. Note that these
rates do not reflect private rates of return, which typically must
be greater to justify a project, at around 10-25%.

"The potential for a double dividend arising from climate
mitigation policies was extensively studied during the 1990s.
In addition to the primary aim of improving the environment
(the first dividend), such policies, if conducted through revenue-
raising instruments such as carbon taxes or auctioned emission
permits, yield a second dividend, which can be set against the
gross costs of these policies. All domestic GHG policies have
an indirect economic cost from the interactions of the policy
instruments with the fiscal system, but in the case of revenue-
raising policies this cost is partly offset (or more than offset) if,
for example, the revenue is used to reduce existing distortionary
taxes. Whether these revenue-raising policies can reduce
distortions in practice depends on whether revenues can be
“recycled” to tax reduction.

"This leads to contrasting two generic approaches, namely the
engineering-economics approach and least-cost equilibrium
modelling. In the first approach, each technology is assessed
independently via an accounting of its costs and savings. Once
these elements have been estimated, a unit cost can be calculated
for each action, and each action can be ranked according to
its costs. This approach is very useful to point out the potentials
for negative cost abatements due to the ‘efficiency gap’ between
the best available technologies and technologies currently in use.
However, its most important limitation is that studies neglect or

however, only consider some of the four elements. Economic
models, for example, mainly assess market-oriented policies
and in some cases technology policies primarily those related
to energy supply options, while engineering approaches mainly
focus on supply and demand side technology policies. Both
of these approaches are relatively weak in the representation

to remedy this defect, by considering all actions simultaneously

give very easily interpretable results that compare an optimal

term marginal abatement costs, which govern most of the
macroeconomic impacts of climate policies, are very sensitive

anticipated mitigation level. This risk is far lower in models allowing
for carbon trading. Over the long term this risk is reduced as
technical change curbs down the slope of marginal cost curves.

are targetted to finance cuts in the marginal rates of pre-existing
distortionary taxes, such as income, payroll, and sales taxes.
While recycling revenues in a lump-sum fashion confers no
efficiency benefit, recycling through marginal rate cuts helps
avoid some of the efficiency costs or dead-weight loss of
existing taxes. This raises the possibility that revenue-neutral
carbon taxes might offer a double dividend by (1) improving

intervention that would be needed and equates the marginal
abatement cost to meet a prescribed emissions target. The size
of the tax required to meet a specific target will be determined
by the marginal source of supply (including conservation) with

the opportunity for reducing overall mitigation costs.
Conversely, limits on the extent to which a country can satisfy
its obligations through the purchase of emissions quota can
increase mitigation costs. Several studies have calculated the
magnitude of the increase to be substantial falling in particular
on countries with the highest marginal abatement costs. But
another parameter likely to limit the savings from carbon

for Annex B and full global trading compared to a no-trading
case. The calculation is made by various models with both
global and regional detail. In each instance, the goal is to meet

All of the models show significant gains as the size of the
trading market is expanded. The difference among models is
due in part to differences in their baseline, the assumptions
about the cost and availability of low-cost substitutes on both
the supply and demand sides of the energy sector, and the
treatment of short-term macro shocks. In general, all calculated
gross costs for the non-trading case are below 2% of GDP
(which is assumed to have increased significantly in the period
considered) and in most cases below 1%. Annex B trading
lowers the costs for the OECD region as a whole to less than
0.5% and regional impacts within this vary between 0.1% to
1.1%. Global trading in general would decrease these costs to
well below 0.5% of GDP with OECD average below 0.2%.

was that Annex B abatement would have a predominantly
adverse impact on non-Annex B regions. In simulations of
the Kyoto Protocol, the results are more mixed with some non-
Annex B regions experiencing welfare gains and other losses.
This is mainly due to a milder target in the Kyoto simulations
than in pre-Kyoto simulations. It was also universally found
that most non-Annex B economies that suffered welfare losses
under uniform independent abatement would suffer smaller
welfare losses under emissions trading.

"While the SAR reported that there was a high variance in estimates
of carbon leakage from the available models, there has been some
reduction in the variance of estimates obtained in the subsequent
years. However, this may largely result from the development of
new models based on reasonably similar assumptions and data
sources. Such developments do not necessarily reflect more
widespread agreement about appropriate behavioural assumptions.
One robust result seems to be that carbon leakage is an increasing
function of the stringency of the abatement strategy. This means
that leakage may be a less serious problem under the Kyoto target
than under the more stringent targets considered previously. Also
emission leakage is lower under emissions trading than under
independent abatement. Exemptions for energy-intensive industries
found in practice, and other factors, make the higher model estimates
for carbon leakage unlikely, but would raise aggregate costs.

"With respect to baseline considerations most of the literature
on ancillary benefits systematically treats only government
policies and regulations with respect to the environment. In
contrast, other regulatory policy baseline issues, such as those
relating to energy, transportation, and health, have been
generally ignored, as have baseline issues that are not
regulatory, such as those tied with technology, demography,
and the natural resource base. For the studies reviewed here,
the biggest share of the ancillary benefits is related to public
health. A major component of uncertainty for modelling
ancillary benefits for public health is the link between
emissions and atmospheric concentrations, particularly in light
of the importance of secondary pollutants. However, it is
recognized that there are significant ancillary benefits in
addition to those for public health that have not been quantified
or monetized. At the same time, it appears that there are major
gaps in the methods and models for estimating ancillary costs.

"Policies aimed at mitigating greenhouse gases can have
positive and negative side effects on society, not taking into
account benefits of avoided climate change. This section
assesses in particular those studies that evaluate the side effects
of climate change mitigation. Therefore the term “ancillary
benefits or costs” is used. There is little agreement on the
definition, reach, and size of these ancillary benefits, and on
methodologies for integrating them into climate policy. Criteria
are established for reviewing the growing literature linking
specific carbon mitigation policies to monetized ancillary
benefits. Recent studies that take an economy-wide, rather than
a sectoral, approach to ancillary benefits are described in the
report and their credibility is examined (Section 9 presents
sectoral analyses). In spite of recent progress in methods
development, it remains very challenging to develop
quantitative estimates of the ancillary effects, benefits and costs
of GHG mitigation policies. Despite these difficulties, in the
short term, ancillary benefits of GHG policies under some
circumstances can be a significant fraction of private (direct)
mitigation costs and in some cases they can be comparable to
the mitigation costs. According to the literature, ancillary
benefits may be of particular importance in developing
countries, but this literature is as yet limited.

are between 0.1% and 1.1% of projected GDP”. These studies
encompass a wide range of assumptions. Models whose results
are reported here assume full use of emissions trading without
transaction cost. Results for cases that do not allow Annex B

20 Many other studies incorporating more precisely the country specifics and
diversity of targetted policies provide a wider range of net cost estimates.

21 Annex II countries: Group of countries included in Annex II to the
UNFCCC, including all developed countries in the Organisation of
Economic Co-operation and Development.

22 Annex B countries: Group of countries included in Annex B in the Kyoto
Protocol that have agreed to a target for their greenhouse gas emissions,
including all the Annex I countries (as amended in 1998) but Turkey
and Belarus.

3 Many metrics can be used to present costs. For example, if the annual
costs to developed countries associated with meeting Kyoto targets with
full Annex B trading are in the order of 0.5% of GDP, this represents
US$125 billion (1000 million) per year, or US$125 per person per year
by 2010 in Annex II (SRES assumptions). This corresponds to an impact
on economic growth rates over ten years of less than 0.1 percentage point.

controlling risks of high costs in given countries, and thus can
complement domestic policy mechanisms. Similarly, they can

show national marginal costs to meet the Kyoto targets from about
US$20/tC up to US$600/tC without trading, and a range from
about US$15/C up to US$150/C with Annex B trading. The cost

emissions trading, that could lessen the impact on non-
Annex I, oil-exporting countries, and therefore tend to
overstate both the costs to these countries and overall costs.
The effects on these countries can be further reduced by
removal of subsidies for fossil fuels, energy tax restructuring
according to carbon content, increased use of natural gas,
and diversification of the economies of non-Annex I, oil-
exporting countries.

Other non-Annex I countries: They may be adversely affected
by reductions in demand for their exports to OECD nations
and by the price increase of those carbon-intensive and
other products they continue to import. These countries
may benefit from the reduction in fuel prices, increased
exports of carbon-intensive products and the transfer of
environmentally sound technologies and know-how. The
net balance for a given country depends on which of these
factors dominates. Because of these complexities, the
breakdown of winners and losers remains uncertain.
Carbon leakage**: The possible relocation of some carbon-
intensive industries to non-Annex I countries and wider
impacts on trade flows in response to changing prices may
lead to leakage in the order of 5-20%. Exemptions, for
example for energy-intensive industries, make the higher
model estimates for carbon leakage unlikely, but would
raise aggregate costs. The transfer of environmentally

"Several studies have attempted to identify the optimal near-
term hedging strategy based on the uncertainty regarding the
long-term objective. These studies find that the desirable

— the amount that society is willing to pay to avoid risk —
ultimately is a political decision that differs among countries.

"For studies that assume that the target is known, the issue is one
of identifying the least-cost mitigation pathway for achieving the
prescribed target. Here the choice of pathway can be seen as a
carbon budget problem. This problem has been so far addressed
in terms of CO, only and very limited treatment has been given
tonon-CO, GHGs. A concentration target defines an allowable
amount of carbon to be emitted into the atmosphere between
now and the date at which the target is to be achieved. The
issue is how best to allocate the carbon budget over time.
"	Text
"The concentration of CO, in the atmosphere is determined more
by cumulative rather than by year-by-year emissions. That is, a
particular concentration target can be reached through a variety
of emissions pathways. A number of studies suggest that the choice
of emissions pathway can be as important as the target itself in
determining overall mitigation costs. The studies fall into two
categories: those that assume that the target is known and those
that characterize the issue as one of decision making under
uncertainty.
"	Text
"The assumption that the target is known with certainty is, of
course, an oversimplification. Fortunately, the UNFCCC
recognizes the dynamic nature of the decision problem. It calls
for periodic reviews “in light of the best scientific information
on climate change and its impacts.” Such a sequential decision
making process aims to identify short-term hedging strategies
in the face of long-term uncertainties. The relevant question
is not “what is the best course of action for the next hundred
years” but rather “what is the best course for the near-term
given the long-term uncertainties.”
"	Text
"It should also be noted that the lower the concentration target,
the smaller the carbon budget, and hence the earlier the
departure from the baseline. However, even with higher
concentration targets, the more gradual transition from the
baseline does not negate the need for early action. All
stabilization targets require future capital stock to be less
carbon-intensive. This has immediate implications for near-
term investment decisions. New supply options typically take
many years to enter into the marketplace. An immediate and
sustained commitment to R&D is required if low-carbon low-
cost substitutes are to be available when needed.
"	Text
"Most studies that have attempted to identify the least-cost pathway
for meeting a particular target conclude that such as pathway
tends to depart gradually from the model’s baseline in the early
years with more rapid reductions later on. There are several
reasons why this is so. A gradual near-term transition from the
world’s present energy system minimizes premature retirement
of existing capital stock, provides time for technology
development, and avoids premature lock-in to early versions
of rapidly developing low-emission technology. On the other
hand, more aggressive near-term action would decrease
environmental risks associated with rapid climatic changes,
stimulate more rapid deployment of existing low-emission
technologies (see also Section 8.10), provide strong near-term
incentives to future technological changes that may help to
avoid lock-in to carbon intensive technologies, and allow for
later tightening of targets should that be deemed desirable in
light of evolving scientific understanding.

"level, there is a larger increase in costs passing from SSOppmv
to 450ppmv unless the emissions in the baseline scenario are
very low. These results, however, do not incorporate carbon
sequestration and gases other than CO,, and did not examine
the possible effect of more ambitious targets on induced
technological change”. In particular, the choice of the reference
scenario has a strong influence. Recent studies using the IPCC
SRES reference scenarios as baselines against which to analyze
stabilization clearly show that the average reduction in projected
GDP in most of the stabilization scenarios reviewed here is under
3% of the baseline value (the maximum reduction across all the
stabilization scenarios reached 6.1% ina given year). At the same
time, some scenarios (especially in the A1T group) showed an
increase in GDP compared to the baseline because of apparent
positive economic feedbacks of technology development and
transfer. The GDP reduction (averaged across storylines and
stabilization levels) is lowest in 2020 (1%), reaches a maximum
in 2050 (1.5%), and declines by 2100 (1.3%). However, in
the scenario groups with the highest baseline emissions (A2
and A1FI), the size of the GDP reduction increases throughout
the modelling period. Due to their relatively small scale when
compared to absolute GDP levels, GDP reductions in the post-
SRES stabilization scenarios do not lead to significant declines
in GDP growth rates over this century. For example, the annual
1990-2100 GDP growth rate across all the stabilization
scenarios was reduced on average by only 0.003% per year,
with a maximum reduction reaching 0.06% per year.

(apart from the renewables sector and perhaps the natural

location of the losses, and to identify the sectors that may
benefit. However, it is worth noting that the available literature
to make this assessment is limited: there are few comprehensive
studies of the sectoral effects of mitigation, compared with
those on the macro GDP effects, and they tend to be for Annex
I countries and regions.
"	Text
"Recent research suggests that the effect on timing depends on the
source of technological change. When the channel for technological
change is R&D, the induced technological change makes it
preferable to concentrate more abatement efforts in the future.
The reason is that technological change lowers the costs of future
abatement relative to current abatement, making it more cost-
effective to place more emphasis on future abatement. But,
when the channel for technological change is learning-by-
doing, the presence of induced technological change has an
ambiguous impact on the optimal timing of abatement. On the
one hand, induced technical change makes future abatement
less costly, which suggests emphasizing future abatement efforts.
On the other hand, there is an added value to current abatement
because such abatement contributes to experience or learning
and helps reduce the costs of future abatement. Which of these
two effects dominates depends on the particular nature of the
technologies and cost functions.

"Industries concerned directly with mitigation are likely to benefit
from action. These industries include renewable and nuclear
electricity, producers of mitigation equipment (incorporating
energy- and carbon-saving technologies), agriculture and forestry
producing energy crops, and research services producing
energy and carbon-saving R&D. They may benefit in the long
term from the availability of financial and other resources that
would otherwise have been taken up in fossil fuel production.
They may also benefit from reductions in tax burdens if taxes
are used for mitigation and the revenues recycled as reductions
in employer, corporate, or other taxes. Those studies that report
reductions in GDP do not always provide a range of recycling
options, suggesting that policy packages increasing GDP have
not been explored. The extent and nature of the benefits will
vary with the policies followed. Some mitigation policies can
lead to net overall economic benefits, implying that the gains
from many sectors will outweigh the losses for coal and other
fossil fuels, and energy-intensive industries. In contrast, other
less-well-designed policies can lead to overall losses.
"	Text
"It is also well established that the overall effects on GDP of
mitigation policies and measures, whether positive or negative,
conceal large differences between sectors. In general, the
energy intensity and the carbon intensity of the economies
will decline. The coal and perhaps the oil industries are
expected to lose substantial proportions of their traditional
output relative to those in the reference scenarios, though the
impact of this on the industries will depend on diversification,
and other sectors may increase their outputs but by much
smaller proportions. Reductions in fossil fuel output below
the baseline will not impact all fossil fuels equally. Fuels have
different costs and price sensitivities; they respond differently
to mitigation policies. Energy-efficiency technology is fuel
and combustion device-specific, and reductions in demand
can affect imports differently from output. Energy-intensive
sectors, such as heavy chemicals, iron and steel, and mineral
products, will face higher costs, accelerated technical or
organizational change, or loss of output (again relative to the
reference scenario) depending on their energy use and the
policies adopted for mitigation.

"Within this broad picture, certain sectors will be substantially
affected by mitigation. Relative to the reference case, the coal
industry, producing the most carbon-intensive of products,
faces almost inevitable decline in the long term, relative to
the baseline projection. Technologies still under development,
such as CO, removal and storage from coal-burning plants
and in-situ gasification, could play a future role in maintaining
the output of coal whilst avoiding CO, and other emissions.
Particularly large effects on the coal sector are expected from
policies such as the removal of fossil fuel subsidies or the
restructuring of energy taxes so as to tax the carbon content
rather than the energy content of fuels. It is a well-established
finding that removal of the subsidies would result in substantial
reductions in GHG emissions, as well as stimulating economic
growth. However, the effects in specific countries depend
heavily on the type of subsidy removed and the commercial
viability of alternative energy sources, including imported coal.

"Thus, studies show a wide range of estimates for the impact
of GHG mitigation policies on oil production and revenue.
Much of these differences are attributable to the assumptions
made about: the availability of conventional oil reserves, the
degree of mitigation required, the use of emission trading,
control of GHGs other than CO,,, and the use of carbon sinks.
However, all studies show a net growth in both oil production
and revenue to at least 2020, and significantly less impact on
the real price of oil than has resulted from market fluctuations
over the past 30 years. Figure TS-9 shows the projection of real
oil prices to 2010 from the IEA’s 1998 World Energy Outlook,
and the effect of Kyoto implementation from the G-cubed
model, the study which shows the largest fall in Organization
of Oil Exporting Countries (OPEC) revenues in Table TS-6.
The 25% loss in OPEC revenues in the non-trading scenario
implies a 17% fall in oil prices shown for 2010 in the figure;
this is reduced to a fall of just over 7% with Annex I trading.

"In general as regards the effects on the electricity sector,
mitigation policies either mandate or directly provide incentives
for increased use of zero-emitting technologies (such as nuclear,
hydro, and other renewables) and lower-GHG-emitting
generation technologies (such as combined cycle natural gas).
Or, second, they drive their increased use indirectly by more
flexible approaches that place a tax on or require a permit for
emission of GHGs. Either way, the result will be a shift in the
mix of fuels used to generate electricity towards increased
use of the zero- and lower-emitting generation technologies,
and away from the higher-emitting fossil fuels.

local and regional air and water quality, and thereby lessen
damage to human, animal, and plant health, and to ecosystems.

flue gas desulphurization on a power station combined with

international competitiveness or the migration of GHG-emitting
industries from the region implementing the policy (so-called
carbon leakage). The estimated effects, reported in the literature,
on international price competitiveness are small while those on
carbon leakage appear to beat the stage of competing explanations,
with large differences depending on the models and the assumptions
used. There are several reasons for expecting that such effects
will not be substantial. First, mitigation policies actually adopted
use a range of instruments and usually include special treatment
to minimize adverse industrial effects, such as exemptions for
energy-intensive industries. Second, the models assume that
any migrating industries will use the average technology of
the area to which they will move; however, instead they may
adopt newer, lower CO,-emitting technologies. Third, the
mitigation policies also encourage low-emission technologies
and these also may migrate, reducing emissions in industries
in other countries (see also Section 8.7).

"Climate change is profoundly different from most other
environmental problems with which humanity has grappled.
A combination of several features lends the climate problem
its uniqueness. They include public good issues raising from
the concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere that requires
collective global action, the multiplicity of decision makers
ranging from global down to the micro level of firms and
individuals, and the heterogeneity of emissions and their
consequences around the world. Moreover, the long-term
nature of climate change originates from the fact that it is the
concentration of GHGs that matters rather than their annual
emissions and this feature raises the thorny issues of
intergenerational transfers of wealth and environmental goods
and bads. Next, human activities associated with climate change
are widespread, which makes narrowly defined technological
solutions impossible, and the interactions of climate policy with

those with cost-benefit models framed as a Bayesian decision
analysis problem show that optimal near-term (next two
decades) emission paths diverge only modestly under perfect
foresight, and hedging even for low-probability, high-consequence
scenarios (see Figure TS-10b). However, decisions about near-
term climate policies may have to be made while the
stabilization target is still being debated. Decision-making
therefore should consider appropriate hedging against future
resolution of that target and possible revision of the scientific
insights in the risks of climate change. There are significant
differences in the two approaches. With a cost-effectiveness
analysis, the target must be made regardless of costs. With a
cost-benefit analysis, costs and benefits are balanced at the
margin. Nevertheless, the basic message is quite similar and
involves the explicit incorporation of uncertainty and its
sequential resolution over time. The desirable amount of
hedging depends upon one’s assessment of the stakes, the odds,
and the costs of policy measures. The risk premium — the
amount that society is willing to pay to reduce risk — ultimately
is a political decision that differs among countries.

The literature presents different theoretical strategies to optimize
an international regime. For example, it can be made attractive
for countries to join the group that commits to specific targets
for limitation and reduction of emissions by increasing the equity
of a larger agreement — and therefore its efficiency — through
measures like an appropriate distribution of targets over time,
the linkage of the climate debate with other issues (“issue

"It is difficult to generalize about sustainable development
policies and choices. Sustainability implies and requires
diversity, flexibility, and innovation. Policy choices are meant
to introduce changes in technological patterns of natural
resource use, production and consumption, structural changes
in the production systems, spatial distribution of population
and economic activities, and behavioural patterns. Climate
change literature has by and large addressed the first three
topics, while the relevance of choices and decisions related to
behavioural patterns and lifestyles has been paid scant
attention. Consumption patterns in the industrialized countries
are an important reason for climate change. If people changed
their preferences this could alleviate climate change considerably.
To change consumption patterns, however, people must not
only change their behaviour but also change themselves
because these patterns are an essential element of lifestyles
and, therefore, of self-esteem. Yet, apart from climate change
there are other reasons to do so as well as indications that this

* timing and composition of mitigation measures (investment
into technological development or immediate emission

avoids premature retirement of existing capital

It also reduces the switching cost of existing
capital and prevents rising prices of investments
caused by crowding out effects.

Exploit more fully natural stock turnover by
influencing new investments from the present
onwards.

By limiting emissions to levels consistent with low
CO, concentrations, preserves an option to limit
CO, concentrations to low levels using current
technology.

Reduces the risks from uncertainties in stabilization
constraints and hence the risk of being forced
into very rapid reductions that would require
premature capital retirement later.

 

Social effects and
inertia

* Gradual emission reduction reduces the extent of
induced sectoral unemployment by giving more
time to retrain the workforce and for structural
shifts in the labour market and education.
Reduces welfare losses associated with the need
for fast changes in people’s lifestyles and living
arrangements.

Especially if lower stabilization targets would be
required ultimately, stronger early action reduces
the maximum rate of emissions abatement required
subsequently and reduces associated transitional
problems, disruption, and the welfare losses
associated with the need for faster later changes
in people’s lifestyles and living arrangements.

equity

° Reduces the present value of future abatement
costs (ceteris paribus), but possibly reduces future
relative costs by furnishing cheap technologies
and increasing future income levels.

Climate change refers to a statistically significant variation in
either the mean state of the climate or in its variability,
persisting for an extended period (typically decades or longer).
Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or
external forcings, or to persistent anthropogenic changes in
the composition of the atmosphere or in land use. Note that
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC), in its Article 1, defines “climate change”
as: “a change of climate which is attributed directly or
indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the
global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate
variability observed over comparable time periods.” The
UNFCCC thus makes a distinction between “climate change”
attributable to human activities altering the atmospheric
composition, and “climate variability” attributable to natural
causes. See also climate variability.

The climate system is the highly complex system consisting
of five major components: the atmosphere, the hydrosphere,
the cryosphere, the land surface and the biosphere, and the
interactions between them. The climate system evolves in time
under the influence of its own internal dynamics and because
of external forcings such as volcanic eruptions, solar variations,
and human-induced forcings such as the changing composition
of the atmosphere and /and-use change.

A numerical representation of the climate system based on the
physical, chemical, and biological properties of its components,
their interactions and feedback processes, and accounting for
all or some of its known properties. The climate system can be
represented by models of varying complexity—that is, for any
one component or combination of components a “hierarchy”
of models can be identified, differing in such aspects as the
number of spatial dimensions, the extent to which physical,
chemical or biological processes are explicitly represented,
or the level at which empirical parametrizations are involved.
Coupled atmosphere/ocean/sea-ice general circulation models
(AOGCMs) provide a comprehensive representation of the
climate system. There is an evolution towards more complex
models with active chemistry and biology. Climate models
are applied, as a research tool, to study and simulate the
climate, but also for operational purposes, including monthly,
seasonal, and interannual climate predictions.

Levy imposed by a government on each unit of CO,-equivalent

the carbon in fossil fuels is ultimately emitted as carbon dioxide,
a levy on the carbon content of fossil fuels—a carbon tax—is
equivalent to an emissions tax for emissions caused by fossil-
fuel combustion. An energy tax—a levy on the energy content
of fuels—reduces demand for energy and so reduces carbon
dioxide emissions from fossil-fuel use. An ecotax is designated

economic behavior) to follow an ecologically benign path.
International emissions/carbon/energy tax is a tax imposed on

Greenhouse gases are those gaseous constituents of the atmosphere,
both natural and anthropogenic, that absorb and emit radiation
at specific wavelengths within the spectrum of infrared radiation
emitted by the Earth’s surface, the atmosphere, and clouds. This
property causes the greenhouse effect. Water vapor (H,O), carbon
dioxide (CO,), nitrous oxide (N,O), methane (CH,), and ozone
(O,) are the primary greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere.
Moreover there are a number of entirely human-made greenhouse
gases in the atmosphere, such as the halocarbons and other
chlorine- and bromine-containing substances, dealt with under
the Montreal Protocol. Besides CO,, N,O, and CH,, the Kyoto
Protocol deals with the greenhouse gases sulfur hexafluoride (SF,),
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and perfluorocarbons (PFCs).

Greenhouse gases effectively absorb infrared radiation, emitted
by the Earth’s surface, by the atmosphere itself due to the same
gases, and by clouds. Atmospheric radiation is emitted to all sides,
including downward to the Earth’s surface. Thus greenhouse
gases trap heat within the surface-troposphere system. This is
called the “natural greenhouse effect.” Atmospheric radiation
is strongly coupled to the temperature of the level at which it
is emitted. In the troposphere, the temperature generally decreases
with height. Effectively, infrared radiation emitted to space
originates from an altitude with a temperature of, on average,
-19°C, in balance with the net incoming solar radiation, whereas
the Earth’s surface is kept at a much higher temperature of, on
average, +14°C. An increase in the concentration of greenhouse
gases leads to an increased infrared opacity of the atmosphere,

"surrogate for adjustment ume. —

In simple cases, where the global removal of the compound is
directly proportional to the total mass of the reservoir, the
adjustment time equals the turnover time: T = T,. An example
is CFC-11 which is removed from the atmosphere only by
photochemical processes in the stratosphere. In more complicated
cases, where several reservoirs are involved or where the removal
is not proportional to the total mass, the equality T = T, no
longer holds. Carbon dioxide is an extreme example. Its turnover
time is only about 4 years because of the rapid exchange between
atmosphere and the ocean and terrestrial biota. However, a
large part of that CO, is returned to the atmosphere within a
few years. Thus, the adjustment time of CO, in the atmosphere
is actually determined by the rate of removal of carbon from
the surface layer of the oceans into its deeper layers. Although
an approximate value of 100 years may be given for the
adjustment time of CO, in the atmosphere, the actual
adjustment is faster initially and slower later on. In the case of
methane, the adjustment time is different from the turnover
time, because the removal is mainly through a chemical
reaction with the hydroxyl radical OH, the concentration of
which itself depends on the CH, concentration. Therefore the
CH, removal S is not proportional to its total mass M.

The stratosphere contains a layer in which the concentration
of ozone is greatest, the so-called ozone layer. The layer
extends from about 12 to 40 km. The ozone concentration
reaches a maximum between about 20 and 25 km. This layer
is being depleted by human emissions of chlorine and bromine
compounds. Every year, during the Southern Hemisphere
spring, a very strong depletion of the ozone layer takes place
over the Antarctic region, also caused by human-made chlorine
and bromine compounds in combination with the specific
meteorological conditions of that region. This phenomenon is

Ozone, the triatomic form of oxygen (O,), is a gaseous atmospheric
constituent. In the troposphere it is created both naturally and by
photochemical reactions involving gases resulting from human
activities (photochemical “smog’’). In high concentrations,
tropospheric ozone can be harmful to a wide-range of living
organisms. Tropospheric ozone acts as a greenhouse gas. In the
stratosphere, ozone is created by the interaction between solar
ultraviolet radiation and molecular oxygen (O,). Stratospheric
ozone plays a decisive role in the stratospheric radiative balance.
Its concentration is highest in the ozone layer. Depletion of
stratospheric ozone, due to chemical reactions that may be enhanced
by climate change, results in an increased ground-level flux of
ultraviolet-B radiation. See also Montreal Protocol and ozone layer.

"The response time or adjustment time is the time needed for
the climate system or its components to re-equilibrate to a new
state, following a forcing resulting from external and internal
processes or feedbacks. It is very different for various components
of the climate system. The response time of the troposphere is
relatively short, from days to weeks, whereas the stratosphere comes
into equilibrium on a time scale of typically a few months. Due
to their large heat capacity, the oceans have a much longer response
time, typically decades, but up to centuries or millennia. The
response time of the strongly coupled surface-troposphere system
is, therefore, slow compared to that of the stratosphere, and
mainly determined by the oceans. The biosphere may respond
fast (e.g., to droughts), but also very slowly to imposed changes.
See lifetime for a different definition of response time pertinent
to the rate of processes affecting the concentration of trace gases.

These approaches analyze greenhouse gas emissions as they
would be constrained by adopting a long-term climate—rather
than greenhouse gas concentration stabilization—target (e.g.,
expressed in terms of temperature or sea level changes or the
rate of such changes). The main objective of these approaches
is to evaluate the implications of such long-term targets for short-
or medium-term “tolerable” ranges of global greenhouse gas
emissions. Also referred to as safe-landing approaches.

An expression of the degree to which a value (e.g., the future
state of the climate system) is unknown. Uncertainty can result
from lack of information or from disagreement about what is
known or even knowable. It may have many types of sources,
from quantifiable errors in the data to ambiguously defined
concepts or terminology, or uncertain projections of human
behavior. Uncertainty can therefore be represented by quantitative
measures (e.g., arange of values calculated by various models)
or by qualitative statements (e.g., reflecting the judgment of a
team of experts). See Moss and Schneider (2000).

The Convention was adopted on 9 May 1992 in New York
and signed at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro by
more than 150 countries and the European Community. Its
ultimate objective is the “stabilization of greenhouse gas
concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent
dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate
system.” It contains commitments for all Parties. Under the
Convention, Parties included in Annex J aim to return
greenhouse gas emissions not controlled by the Montreal
Protocol to 1990 levels by the year 2000. The Convention
entered into force in March 1994. See also Kyoto Protocol
and Conference of the Parties (COP).

The terms “top” and “bottom” are shorthand for aggregate
and disaggregated models. The top-down label derives from
how modelers applied macro-economic theory and
econometric techniques to historical data on consumption,
prices, incomes, and factor costs to model final demand for
goods and services, and supply from main sectors, like the
energy sector, transportation, agriculture, and industry.
Therefore, top-down models evaluate the system from
aggregate economic variables, as compared to bottom-up
models that consider technological options or project specific
climate change mitigation policies. Some technology data
were, however, integrated into top-down analysis and so the
distinction is not that clear-cut.
