"We take this opportunity to express our gratitude to the following
individuals for nurturing another IPCC report through to a success-
ful completion:
"	Text
"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was jointly
established by the World Meteorological Organization and the United
Nations Environment Programme in 1988, in order to: (i) assess avail-
able scientific information on climate change, (ii) assess the
environmental and socio-economic impacts of climate change, and
(iii) formulate response strategies. The IPCC First Assessment Report
was completed in August 1990 and served as the basis for negotiating
the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The IPCC also
completed its 1992 Supplement and Climate Change 1994: Radiative
Forcing of Climate Change and An Evaluation of the IPCC 1S92 Emission
Scenarios to assist the Convention process further.
"	Text
"In 1992, the Panel reorganized its Working Groups II and III to
assess, respectively, the impacts and response options, and the
social and economic aspects of climate change. It committed itself
to completing its Second Assessment in 1995, not only updating the
information on the same range of topics as in the First Assessment,
but also including the new subject area of technical issues related to
the socio-economic aspects of climate change. We applaud the IPCC
for producing its Second Assessment Report (SAR) as scheduled. We
are convinced that the SAR, as the earlier IPCC reports, would
become a standard work of reference, widely used by policymakers,
scientists and other experts.
"	Text
"As usual in the IPCC, successin producing this report has depended
upon the enthusiasm and cooperation of numerous busy scientists
and other experts worldwide. We are exceedingly pleased to note
here the very special efforts made by the IPCC in ensuring the
participation of scientists and other experts from the developing
and transitional economy countries in its activities, in particular in
the writing, reviewing and revising of its reports. The scientists and
experts from the developed, developing and transitional economy
countries have given of their time very generously, and govern-
ments have supported them, in the enormous intellectual and
physical effort required, often going substantially beyond reason-
able demands of duty. Without such conscientious and professional
involvement, the IPCC would be greatly impoverished. We express
to all these scientists and experts, and the governments who
supported them, our sincere appreciation for their commitment.

synthesis report is to provide scientific, technical and socio-

these challenges. It is based on the 1994 and 1995 reports of the
IPCC Working Groups.
"	Text
"1.6 The report follows through the various matters which are
addressed in Article 2. It first briefly summarizes the degree of
climate change — the “interference with the climate system” —
which is projected to occur as a result of human activities. It then
goes on to highlight what we know about the vulnerabilities of
ecosystems and human communities to likely climate changes,
especially in regard to agriculture and food production and to other
factors such as water availability, health and the impact of sea-level
rise which are important considerations for sustainable develop-
ment. Thetask of the IPCC isto provide a sound scientific basis that
would enable policymakers to better interpret dangerous anthro-
pogenic interference with the climate system.
"	Text
"1.2 During the past few decades, two important factors
regarding the relationship between humans and the Earth’s climate
have become apparent. First, human activities, including the
burning of fossil fuels, land-use change and agriculture, are increas-
ing the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (which
tend to warm the atmosphere) and, in some regions, aerosols
(microscopic airborne particles, which tend to cool the atmos-
phere). These changes in greenhouse gases and aerosols, taken
together, are projected to change regional and global climate and
climate-related parameters such as temperature, precipitation, soil
moisture and sea level. Second, some human communities have
become more vulnerable! to hazards such as storms, floods and
droughts as a result of increasing population density in sensitive
areas such as river basins and coastal plains. Potentially serious
changes have been identified, including an increase in some regions
in the incidence of extreme high-temperature events, floods and
droughts, with resultant consequences for fires, pest outbreaks, and
ecosystem composition, structure and functioning, including
primary productivity.
"	Text
"11 Following a resolution of the Executive Council of the
World Meteorological Organization (July 1992), the IPCC decided
to include an examination of approaches to Article 2, the Objective
of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC),
in its work programme. It organized a workshop on the subject in
October 1994 in Fortaleza, Brazil, at the invitation of the
Government of Brazil. Thereafter, the IPCC Chairman assembled a
team of lead authors (listed at the end of this report in the
Appendix) under his chairmanship to draft the Synthesis. The team
produced the draft which was submitted for expert and government
review and comment. The final draft Synthesis was approved line by
line by the IPCC at its eleventh session (Rome, 11-15 December
1995), where representatives of 116 governments were present as
well as 13 intergovernmental and 25 non-governmental organiza-
tions. It may be noted for information that all Member States of the
World Meteorological Organization and of the United Nations are
Members of the IPCC and can attend its sessions and those of its
Working Groups. The Synthesis presents information on the scien-
tific and technical issues related to interpreting Article 2 of the
UNFCCC, drawing on the underlying IPCC Second Assessment
Report. Since the Synthesis is not simply a summary of the IPCC
Second Assessment Report, the Summaries for Policymakers of the
three IPCC Working Groups should also be consulted for a
summary of the Second Assessment Report.

change should be cost effective so as to ensure global benefits at the
lowest possible cost. To achieve this, such policies and measures should
take into account different socio-economic contexts, be comprehen-
sive, cover all relevant sources, sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases
and adaptation and comprise all economic sectors. Efforts to address
climate change may be carried out cooperatively by interested Parties.”

"1.8 The report then addresses issues related to equity and to
ensuring that economic development proceeds in a sustainable
manner. This involves addressing, for instance, estimates of the
likely damage of climate change impacts, and the impacts, includ-
ing costs and benefits, of adaptation and mitigation. Finally, a
number of insights from available studies point to ways of taking
initial actions (see the section on Road Forward) even if, at present,
it is difficult to decide upon a target for atmospheric concentrations,
including considerations of time-frames, that would prevent “danger-
ous anthropogenic interference with the climate system”.

"1.9 Climate change presents the decision maker with a set of
formidable complications: considerable remaining uncertainties
inherent in the complexity of the problem, the potential for
irreversible damages or costs, a very long planning horizon, long
time lags between emissions and effects, wide regional variationsin
causes and effects, an irreducibly global problem, and a multiple of
greenhouse gases and aerosols to consider. Yet another compli-
cation is that effective protection of the climate system requires
international cooperation in the context of wide variations in
income levels, flexibility and expectations of the future; this raises
issues of efficiency and intra-national, international and inter-
generational equity. Equity isan important element for legitimizing
decisions and promoting cooperation.

third lower than the “best estimate” in 1990. This is due primarily
to lower emission scenarios (particularly for CO2 and CFCs), the
inclusion of the cooling effect of sulphate aerosols, and improve-

unlikely to be entirely natural in origin. The balance of evidence,

changes in geographical, seasonal and vertical patterns of atmos-
pheric temperature, suggests a discernible human influence on global
climate. There are uncertainties in key factors, including the magni-
tude and patterns of long-term natural variability. Global sea level
has risen by between 10 and 25 cm over the past 100 years and much
of therise may be related to theincreasein global mean temperature.

"sensitivity and including the effects of future changes in aerosol
concentrations leads to a projected increase of about 1°C by 2100.
The corresponding projection for the highest IPCC scenario (1S92e)
combined with a “high” value of climate sensitivity gives a warming
of about 3.5°C. In all cases the average rate of warming would prob-
ably be greater than any seen in the last 10,000 years, but the actual
annual to decadal changes would include considerable natural vari-
ability. Regional temperature changes could differ substantially
from the global mean value. Because of the thermal inertia of the
oceans, only 50-90% of the eventual equilibrium temperature
change would have been realized by 2100 and temperature would
continue to increase beyond 2100, even if concentrations of green-
house gases were stabilized by that time.
"	Text
"2.6 In the absence of mitigation policies or significant techno-
logical advances that reduce emissions and/or enhance sinks,
concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols are expected to grow
throughout the next century. The IPCC has developed a range of
scenarios, 1S92a-f, of future greenhouse gas and aerosol precursor emis-
sions based on assumptions concerning population and economic
growth, land-use, technological changes, energy availability and fuel
mix during the period 1990 to 21004. By the year 2100, carbon diox-
ide emissions under these scenarios are projected to bein the range of
about 6 GtCS per year, roughly equal to current emissions, to as much
as 36 GtC per year, with thelower end of theIPCC rangeassuminglow
population and economic growth to 2100. Methane emissions are
projected to bein the range 540 to 1170 Tg® CH, per year (1990 emis-
sions were about 500 Tg CH,); nitrous oxide emissions are projected
to bein the range 14 to 19 Tg N per year (1990 emissions were about
13 Tg N). In all cases, the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse
gases and total radiative forcing continue to increase throughout the
simulation period of 1990 to 2100.
"	Text
"2.8 Average sea level is expected to rise as a result of thermal
expansion of the oceans and melting of glaciers and ice-sheets. For
the 1S92a scenario, assuming the “best estimate” values of climate
sensitivity and of ice melt sensitivity to warming, and including
the effects of future changes in aerosol concentrations, models
project an increase in sea level of about 50 cm from the present to
2100. This estimate is approximately 25% lower than the “best
estimate” in 1990 due to the lower temperature projection, but
also reflecting improvements in the climate and ice melt models.
Combining the lowest emission scenario (1S92c) with the “low”
climate and ice melt sensitivities and including aerosol effects
gives a projected sea-level rise of about 15 cm from the present to
2100. The corresponding projection for the highest emission
scenario (IS92e) combined with “high” climate and icemelt
sensitivities gives a sea-level rise of about 95 cm from the present
to 2100. Sea level would continue to rise at a similar rate in future
centuries beyond 2100, even if concentrations of greenhouse gases
were stabilized by that time, and would continue to do so even
beyond the time of stabilization of global mean temperature.
Regional sea-level changes may differ from the global mean value
owing to land movement and ocean current changes.

economic systems already affected by pollution, increasing resource
demands, and non-sustainable management practices. The
vulnerability of human health and socio-economic systems — and,
to a lesser extent, ecological systems — depends upon economic
circumstances and institutional infrastructure. This implies that

and socio-economic systems (e.g., agriculture, forestry, fisheries and
water resources) are all vital to human development and well-being
and are all sensitive to both the magnitude and the rate of climate
change. Whereas many regions are likely to experience the adverse
effects of climate change — some of which are potentially
irreversible — some effects of climate change are likely to be
beneficial. Hence, different segments of society can expect to
confront a variety of changes and the need to adapt to them.

"3.5 Unambiguous detection of climateinduced changes in
most ecological and social systems will prove extremely difficult in
the coming decades. This is because of the complexity of these
systems, their many non-linear feedbacks, and their sensitivity to a
large number of climatic and non-climatic factors, all of which are
expected to continue to change simultaneously. As future climate
extends beyond the boundaries of empirical knowledge (i.e, the
documented impacts of climate variation in the past), it becomes
more likely that actual outcomes will include surprises and
unanticipated rapid changes.

water, regulating water runoff, and controlling floods, soil degrada-
tion and beach erosion; and (iv) providing opportunities for
recreation and tourism. The composition and geographic distribu-
tion of many ecosystems (e.g., forests, rangelands, deserts, mountain
systems, lakes, wetlands and oceans) will shift as individual species
respond to changes in climate; there will likely be reductions in
biological diversity and in the goods and services that ecosystems
provide society. Some ecological systems may not reach a new equi-

"2.12 There are many uncertainties and many factors currently
limit our ability to project and detect future climate change.
Future unexpected, large and rapid climate system changes
(as have occurred in the past) are, by their nature, difficult to
predict. This implies that future climate changes may also involve
“surprises”. In particular, these arise from the non-linear nature
of the climate system. When rapidly forced, non-linear systems
are especially subject to unexpected behaviour. Progress can
be made by investigating non-linear processes and sub-
components of the climatic system. Examples of such non-linear
behaviour include rapid circulation changes in the North
Atlantic and feedbacks associated with terrestrial ecosystem
changes.

relatively large changes in runoff, especially in arid and semi-arid

changes in broad vegetation types — with the greatest changes
occurring in high latitudes and the least in the tropics. Climate
change is expected to occur at a rapid rate relative to the speed at
which forest species grow, reproduce and re-establish themselves.
Therefore, the species composition of forests is likely to change;
entire forest types may disappear, while new assemblages of species
and hence new ecosystems may be established. Large amounts of
carbon could be released into the atmosphere during transitions
from one forest type to another because the rate at which carbon
can be lost during times of high forest mortality is greater than the

production in the face of climate change projected under doubled

account the beneficial effects of CO> fertilization but does not allow
for changesin agricultural pests and the possible effects of changing
climatic variability. However, focusing on global agricultural produc-

differences at local and regional scales, even at mid-latitudes. There

exploring variants of alow-CO, emitting energy supply system were
described. These variants illustrate the technical possibility of deep
reductions in CO2 emissions from the energy supply system within
50 to 100 years using alternative strategies. These exercises indicate
the technical possibility of reducing annual global emissions from 6
GtC in 1990 to about 4 GtC in 2050 and to about 2 GtC by 2100.
Cumulative COz emissions from 1990 to 2100 would range from
about 450 GtC to about 470 GtC in these constructions, thus
keeping atmospheric concentrations below 500 ppmv.

"5.12 Beyond the use of biomass fuels to displace fossil fuels,
the management of forests, agricultural lands and rangelands can
play an important role in reducing current emissions of carbon
dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, and enhancing carbon sinks.
A number of measures could conserve and sequester substantial
amounts of carbon (approximately 60-90 GtC in the forestry sector
alone) over the next 50 years. In the forestry sector, measures
include sustaining existing forest cover; slowing deforestation;
natural forest regeneration; establishment of tree plantations;
promoting agroforestry. Other practices in the agriculture sector
could reduce emissions of other greenhouse gases such as methane
and nitrous oxide. In the forestry sector, costs for conserving and
sequestering carbon in biomass and soil are estimated to range
widely but can be competitive with other mitigation options.

"5.9 Costs for integrated energy services relative to costs for
conventional energy depend on relative future energy prices, which
are uncertain within a wide range, and on the performance and
cost characteristics assumed for alternative technologies. However,
within the wide range of future energy prices, one or more of the
variants would plausibly be capable of providing the demanded
energy services at estimated costs that are approximately the same
as estimated future costs for current conventional energy. It is not
possible to identify a least-cost future energy system for the longer
term, as the relative costs of options depend on resource constraints
and technological opportunities that are imperfectly known, and
on actions by governments and the private sector. Improving
energy efficiency, a strong and sustained investment in research,
and development and demonstration to encourage transfer and
diffusion of alternative energy supply technologies are critical to
deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Many of the
technologies being developed would need initial support to enter
the market and to reach sufficient volume to lower costs to become
competitive.
"	Text
"5.13 The availability of low carbon technologies is a
prerequisite for, but not a guarantee of, the ability to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions at reasonable cost. Mitigation of
emissions depends on reducing barriers to the diffusion and
transfer of technology, mobilizing financial resources, supporting
capacity building in developing countries and countries with
economies in transition, and other approaches to assist in the
implementation of behavioural changes and technological
opportunities in all regions of the globe. The optimum mix of
policies will vary from country to country, depending upon energy
markets, economic considerations, political structure and societal
receptiveness. The leadership of national governments in applying
these policies will contribute to responding to the adverse
consequences of climate change. Policies to reduce net greenhouse
gas emissions appear more easily implemented when they are
designed to also address other concerns that impede sustainable
development (eg., air pollution, soil erosion). A number of
policies, many of which might be used by individual nations
unilaterally, and some of which may be used by groups of
countries and would require regional or international agreement,
can facilitate the penetration of less greenhouse gas-intensive
technologies and modified consumption patterns. These include,

raise questions of intergenerational equity because future genera-

today that could affect their well-being, and because it might not be
possible to compensate future generations for consequent reduc-
tionsin their well-being. Discounting is the principal analytical tool
economists use to compare economic effects that occur at different
points in time. The choice of discount rate is of crucial technical
importance for analyses of climate change policy, because the time
horizon is extremely long and mitigation costs tend to come much
earlier than the benefits of avoided damages. The higher the
discount rate, the less future benefits and the more current costs
matter in the analysis.

"5.14 The choice of measures at the domestic level may reflect
objectives other than cost-effectiveness such as meeting fiscal
targets. If a carbon or carbon-energy tax is used as a policy
instrument for reducing emissions, the taxes could raise
substantial revenues and how the revenues are distributed could
dramatically affect the cost of mitigation. If the revenues
are distributed by reducing distortionary taxes in the existing
system, they will help reduce the excess burden of the existing
tax system, potentially yielding an additional economic benefit
(double dividend). For example, those of the European studies
which are more optimistic regarding the potential for tax
recycling, show lower and, in some instances, slightly negative
costs. Conversely, inefficient recycling of the tax revenues
could increase costs. For example, if the tax revenues are used to
finance government programmes that yield a lower return than
the private sector investments foregone because of the tax, then
overall costs will increase. The choice of instruments may also
reflect other environmental objectives such as reducing non-
greenhouse pollution emissions or increasing forest cover or other
concerns such as specific impacts on particular regions or

damageto ecosystems, form an important component of available esti-

comprehensive and are thus a source of major uncertainty in assess-

distribute mitigation costs. Most of them seem to cluster around or
combine approaches: equal per capita emission allocations and
allocations based on incremental departures from national baseline

change for developing countries are different from those for
developed countries. The former often have different urgent
priorities, weaker institutions and are generally more vulnerable to
climate change. However, it is likely that developing countries’
share of emissions will grow further to meet their social and

"7.3 Theassessed literature quantifying total damages from 2 to
3°C warming provides a wide range of point estimates for damages
given the presumed change in atmospheric greenhouse gas concen-
trations. The aggregate estimates tend to be a few per cent of world
GDP, with, in general, considerably higher estimates of damage to
developing countries asa share of their GDP. The aggregate esti mates
are subject to considerable uncertainty, but the range of uncertainty
cannot be gauged from the literature. The range of estimates cannot
be interpreted as a confidence interval given the widely differing
assumptions and methodologies in the studies. Aggregation is likely
to mask even greater uncertainties about damage components.
Regional or sectoral approaches to estimating the consequences of
climate change include a much wider range of estimates of the net
economic effects. For some areas, damages are estimated to be signif-
icantly greater and could negatively affect economic development.
For others, climate changeis estimated to increase economic produc-
tion and present opportunities for economic development.
Equalizing the value of a statistical life at the level typical of that in
developed countries would increase monetized damages several
times, and would further increase the share of the developing coun-
triesin thetotal damage estimate. Small islands and low-lying coastal
areas are particularly vulnerable. Damages from possible large-scale
catastrophes, such as major changes in ocean circulation, are not

top-down! analyses suggest that the costs of substantial reductions
below 1990 CO emissions levels could be as high as several per cent

most studies estimate that annual costs in the range of minus 0.5
per cent of GDP (equivalent to a gain of about $60 billion in total
for OECD countries at today’s GDP levels) to plus 2 per cent of GDP
(equivalent to a loss of about $240 billion) could be reached over
the next several decades. However, studies also show that appropri-
ate timing of abatement measures and the availability of low-cost
alternatives may substantially reduce the size of the overall bill.
Some bottom-up studies show that the costs of reducing emissions
by 20% in developed countries within two to three decades are
negligible to negative. Other bottom-up studies suggest that there
exists a potential for absolute reductions in excess of 50% in the
longer term, without increasing and perhaps even reducing total

"7.6 The costs of stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of
greenhouse gases at levels and within a timeframe which will
prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate
system will be critically dependent on the choice of emissions time
path, consumption patterns, resource and technology availability

programme will be influenced by the rate of capital replacement, the
discount rate and the effect of research and development. Failure to
adopt policies as early as possible to encourage efficient replacement
investments at the end of the economic life of plant and equipment
(i.e., at the point of capital stock turnover) impose an economic cost
to society. Implementing emissions reductions at rates that can be
absorbed in the course of normal stock turnover is likely to be
cheaper than enforcing premature retirement now. The choice of
abatement paths thus involves balancing the economic risks of rapid
abatement now against the risks of delay. Mitigation measures under-
taken in a way that capitalize on other environmental benefits could

countries due to their state of economic development,
infrastructure choices and natural resource base. International
cooperation in a framework of bilateral, regional or international

and drop substantially below 1990 levels subsequently.

Any eventual stabilized concentration is governed more by the
accumulated anthropogenic CO2 emissions from now until the
time of stabilization than by the way those emissions change over
the period. This means that, for a given stabilized concentration
value, higher emissions in early decades require lower emissions
later on. Among the range of stabilization cases studied, for stabi-
lization at 450, 650 or 1000 ppmv, accumulated anthropogenic
emissions over the period 1991 to 2100 are 630 GtC3, 1030 GtC
and 1410 GtC, respectively (+ approximately 15% in each case).
For comparison the corresponding accumulated emissions for
IPCC 1S92 emission scenarios range from 770 to 2190 GtC.
Stabilization of CH, and N30 concentrations at today’s levels
would involve reductions in anthropogenic emissions of 8% and
more than 50% respectively.

There is evidence that tropospheric ozone concentrations in the
Northern Hemisphere have increased since preindustrial times
because of human activity and that this has resulted in a positive
radiative forcing. This forcing is not yet well characterized, but it is
estimated to be about 0.4 Wm (15% of that from the long-lived
greenhouse gases). However, the observations of the most recent
decade show that the upward trend has slowed significantly or
stopped.

"The atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, inter alia,
carbon dioxide (CO), methane (CH,) and nitrous oxide (N30) have
grown significantly: by about 30%, 145%, and 15%, respectively
(values for 1992). These trends can be attributed largely to human
activities, mostly fossil-fuel use, land-use change and agriculture.
The growth rates of COz, CH4 and N20 concentrations were low
during the early 1990s. While this apparently natural variation is
not yet fully explained, recent data indicate that the growth rates are
currently comparable to those averaged over the 1980s.

The direct radiative forcing of the long-lived greenhouse gases
(2.45 Wm?) is due primarily to increases in the concentrations of
COz (1.56 Wm), CHy (0.47 Wm) and N20 (0.14 Wm) (values
‘or 1992).

Many greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere for a long time
(for COz and N30, many decades to centuries), hence they affect
radiative forcing on long time-scales.

The direct radiative forcing due to the CFCs and HCFCs combined
is 0.25 Wm2. However, their net radiative forcing is reduced by
about 0.1 Wm because they have caused stratospheric ozone
depletion which gives rise to a negative radiative forcing.

Growth in the concentration of CFCs, but not HCFCs, has slowed
to about zero. The concentrations of both CFCs and HCFCs, and
their consequent ozone depletion, are expected to decrease
substantially by 2050 through implementation of the Montreal
Protocol and its Adjustments and Amendments.

At present, some long-lived greenhouse gases (particularly HFCs (a
CFC substitute), PFCs and SF.) contribute little to radiative forcing
but their projected growth could contribute several per cent to
radiative forcing during the 21st century.

If carbon dioxide emissions were maintained at near current (1994)
levels, they would lead to anearly constant rate of increase in atmos-
pheric concentrations for at least two centuries, reaching about 500
ppmv (approaching twice the pre-industrial concentration of 280
ppmv) by theend of the 21st century.

A range of carbon cycle mode's indicates that stabilization of atmos-
pheric CO> concentrations at 450, 650 or 1000 ppmv could be
achieved only if global anthropogenic CO emissions drop to 1990

THE PAST CENTURY

"Any human-induced effect on climate will be superimposed on the
background “noise” of natural climate variability, which results
both from internal fluctuations and from external causes such as
solar variability or volcanic eruptions. Detection and attribution
studies attempt to distinguish between anthropogenic and natural
influences. “Detection of change” is the process of demonstrating
that an observed change in climate is highly unusual in a statistical
sense, but does not provide a reason for the change. “Attribution” is
the process of establishing cause and effect relations, including the
testing of competing hypotheses.

"Since the 1990 IPCC Report, considerable progress has been
made in attempts to distinguish between natural and anthro-
pogenic influences on climate. This progress has been achieved by
including effects of sulphate aerosols in addition to greenhouse
gases, thus leading to more realistic estimates of human-induced
radiative forcing. These have then been used in climate models to
provide more complete simulations of the human-induced climate-
change ‘signal’. In addition, new simulations with coupled
atmosphere-ocean models have provided important information
about decade to century time-scale natural internal climate vari-
ability. A further major area of progress is the shift of focus from
studies of global-mean changes to comparisons of modelled and
observed spatial and temporal patterns of climate change.

"Global mean surface air temperature has increased by between
about 0.3 and 0.6°C since the late 19th century; the additional data
available since 1990 and the re-analyses since then have not signif-
icantly changed this range of estimated increase.

Recent years have been among the warmest since 1860, i.e., in the
period of instrumental record, despite the cooling effect of the
1991 Mt Pinatubo volcanic eruption.

Night-time temperatures over land have generally increased more
than daytime temperatures.

Regional changes are also evident. For example, the recent
warming has been greatest over the mid-latitude continents in
winter and spring, with a few areas of cooling, such as the North
Atlantic ocean. Precipitation has increased over land in high
latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, especially during the cold
season.

Global sea level has risen by between 10 and 25 cm over the past
100 years and much of the rise may be related to the increase in
global mean temperature.

There are inadequate data to determine whether consistent global
changes in climate variability or weather extremes have occurred
over the 20th century. On regional scales there is clear evidence of
changes in some extremes and climate variability indicators (e.g.,
fewer frosts in several widespread areas; an increase in the propor-
tion of rainfall from extreme events over the contiguous states of
the USA). Some of these changes have been toward greater vari-
ability; some have been toward lower variability.

The 1990 to mid-1995 persistent warm-phase of the El Nifo-
Southern Oscillation (which causes droughts and floods in many
areas) was unusual in the context of the last 120 years.

The limited available evidence from proxy climate indicators
suggests that the 20th century global mean temperature is at least
as warm as any other century since at least 1400 A.D. Data prior to
1400 are too sparse to allow the reliable estimation of global mean
temperature.

Assessments of the statistical significance of the observed global
mean surface air temperature trend over the last century have used
a variety of new estimates of natural internal and externally-forced
variability. These are derived from instrumental data, palaeodata,
simple and complex climate models, and statistical models fitted to
observations. Most of these studies have detected a significant
change and show that the observed warming trend is unlikely to be
entirely natural in origin.

More convincing recent evidence for the attribution of a human
effect on climate is emerging from pattern-based studies, in which
the modelled climate response to combined forcing by greenhouse
gases and anthropogenic sulphate aerosols is compared with
observed geographical, seasonal and vertical patterns of
atmospheric temperature change. These studies show that such
pattern correspondences increase with time, as one would expect,
as an anthropogenic signal increases in strength. Furthermore, the
probability is very low that these correspondences could occur by
chance as a result of natural internal variability only. The vertical
patterns of change are also inconsistent with those expected for
solar and volcanic forcing.

Our ability to quantify the human influence on global climate is
currently limited because the expected signal is still emerging from
the noise of natural variability, and because there are uncertainties
in key factors. These include the magnitude and patterns of long-
term natural variability and the time-evolving pattern of forcing
by, and response to, changes in concentrations of greenhouse gases
and aerosols, and land surface changes. Nevertheless, the balance
of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on
global climate.

"41n IPCC reports, climate sensitivity usually refers to the long-term (equilib-

atmospheric equivalent CO2 concentration. More generally, it refers to the
equilibrium change in surface air temperature following a unit change in
radiative forcing (°C/Wm-2).

aerosols and the perturbation of natural radiative forcing. Climate
models can then be used to develop projections of future climate.
"	Text
"¢ The increasing realism of simulations of current and past climate
by coupled atmosphere-ocean climate models has increased our
confidence in their use for projection of future climate change.
Important uncertainties remain, but these have been taken into
account in the full range of projections of global mean temperature
and sea-level change.

* For the mid-range IPCC emission scenario, 1S92a, assuming the
“best estimate” value of climate sensitivity? and including the
effects of future increases in aerosol, models project an increase in
global mean surface air temperature relative to 1990 of about 2°C
by 2100. This estimate is approximately one-third lower than the
“best estimate” in 1990. This is due primarily to lower emission
scenarios (particularly for CO2 and the CFCs), theinclusion of the
cooling effect of sulphate aerosols, and improvements in the treat-
ment of the carbon cycle. Combining the lowest IPCC emission
scenario (1S92c) with a “low” value of climate sensitivity and
including the effects of future changes in aerosol concentrations
leads to a projected increase of about 1°C by 2100. The corre
sponding projection for the highest IPCC scenario (IS92e)
combined with a “high” value of climate sensitivity gives a
warming of about 3.5°C. In all cases the average rate of warming
would probably be greater than any seen in the last 10,000 years,
but the actual annual to decadal changes would include consider-
able natural variability. Regional temperature changes could differ
substantially from the global mean value. Because of the thermal
inertia of the oceans, only 50-90% of the eventual equilibrium
temperature change would have been realized by 2100 and temper-
ature would continue to increase beyond 2100, even if
concentrations of greenhouse gases were stabilized by that time.

* Average sea level is expected to rise as a result of thermal expansion
of the oceans and melting of glaciers and ice-sheets. For the 1S92a
scenario, assuming the “best estimate” values of climate sensitivity
and of ice-melt sensitivity to warming, and including the effects of
future changesin aerosol, models project an increase in sea level of
about 50 cm from the present to 2100. This estimate is approxi-
mately 25% lower than the “best estimate” in 1990 due to the
lower temperature projection, but also reflecting improvements in
the climate and icemelt models. Combining the lowest emission
scenario (1S92c) with the “low” climate and ice-melt sensitivities
and including aerosol effects gives a projected sea-level rise of
about 15 cm from the present to 2100. The corresponding projec-
tion for the highest emission scenario (IS92e) combined with
“high” climate and ice-melt sensitivities gives a sea-level rise of
about 95 cm from the present to 2100. Sea level would continue to
rise at a similar rate in future centuries beyond 2100, even if
concentrations of greenhouse gases were stabilized by that time,
and would continueto do so even beyond thetime of stabilization

Confidence is higher in the hemispheric-to-continental scale
projections of coupled atmosphere-ocean climate models than in
the regional projections, where confidence remains low. There is
more confidence in temperature projections than hydrological
changes.

All model simulations, whether they were forced with increased
concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols or with increased
concentrations of greenhouse gases alone, show the following
features: greater surface warming of the land than of the sea in
winter; a maximum surface warming in high northern latitudes in
winter, little surface warming over the Arctic in summer; an
enhanced global mean hydrological cycle, and increased precipita-
tion and soil moisturein high latitudes in winter. All these changes
are associated with identifiable physical mechanisms.

In addition, most simulations show a reduction in the strength of
the north Atlantic thermohaline circulation and a widespread
reduction in diurnal range of temperature. These features too can
be explained in terms of identifiable physical mechanisms.

The direct and indirect effects of anthropogenic aerosols have an
important effect on the projections. Generally, the magnitudes of
thetemperature and precipitation changes are smaller when aerosol
effects are represented, especially in northern mid-latitudes. Note
that the cooling effect of aerosols is not a simple offset to the
warming effect of greenhouse gases, but significantly affects some of
thecontinental scale patterns of climate change, most noticeably in
the summer hemisphere. For example, models that consider only
the effects of greenhouse gases generally project an increase in
precipitation and soil moisture in the Asian summer monsoon
region, whereas models that include, in addition, some of the effects
of aerosols suggest that monsoon precipitation may decrease. The
spatial and temporal distribution of aerosols greatly influences
regional projections, which are therefore more uncertain.

A general warming is expected to lead to an increase in the occur-
rence of extremely hot days and a decrease in the occurrence of
extremely cold days.

Warmer temperatures will lead to amore vigorous hydrological cycle;
this translates into prospects for more severe droughts and/or floods
in someplaces and lesssevere droughts and/or floodsin other places.
Several modelsindicate an increasein precipitation intensity, suggest-
ing a possibility for more extreme rainfall events. Knowledge is
currently insufficient to say whether there will be any changesin the
occurrence or geographical distribution of severe storms, eg.,
tropical cyclones.

Sustained rapid climate change could shift the competitive balance
among species and even lead to forest dieback, altering the terrestrial
uptake and release of carbon. The magnitudeis uncertain, but could
be between zero and 200 GtC over the next one to two centuries,
depending on the rate of climate change.

shift of the present isotherms by approximately 150-550 km or an
altitude shift of about 150-550 m; in low latitudes, temperatures
would generally be increased to higher levels than now exist. This
compares to past tree species migration rates that are believed to be
on the order of 4-200 km per century. Therefore, the species
composition of forests is likely to change; entire forest types may
disappear, while new assemblages of species, hence new ecosystems,
may be established. Figure 2 depicts potential distribution of biomes
under current and a doubled equivalent-CO, climate. Although net
primary productivity could increase, the standing biomass of forests
may not because of more frequent outbreaks and extended ranges of
pests and pathogens, and increasing frequency and intensity of
fires. Large amounts of carbon could be released into the
atmosphere during transitions from one forest type to another
because the rate at which carbon can be lost during times of high
forest mortality is greater than the rate at which it can be gained
through growth to maturity.

including saltwater marshes, mangrove ecosystems, coastal wetlands,
coral reefs, coral atolls and river deltas. Changes in these ecosystems

specific regional effects are uncertain. Relatively small changes in
temperature and precipitation, together with the non-linear
effects on evapotranspiration and soil moisture, can result in
relatively large changes in runoff, especially in arid and semi-arid
regions. High-latitude regions may experience increased runoff due
to increased precipitation, whereas runoff may decrease at lower
latitudes due to the combined effects of increased
evapotranspiration and decreased precipitation. More intense
rainfall would tend to increase runoff and the risk of flooding,
although this would depend not only on the changein rainfall but
also on catchment physical and biological characteristics. A

number of people currently living in areas potentially affected by
ocean flooding by the probability of flooding at these locations in
any year, given the present protection levels and population
density. In the absence of adaptation measures, a 50-cm sea-level
rise would increase this number to about 92 million; a 1-m sea-level
rise would raise it to 118 million. If one incorporates anticipated
population growth, the estimates increase substantially. Some small
island nations and other countries will confront greater vulnerabil-
ity because their existing sea and coastal defense systems are less
well-established. Countries with higher population densities would
be more vulnerable. For these countries, sea-level rise could force
internal or international migration of populations.

this 1-m projection show a particular risk for small islands and

Egypt, 6% for the Netherlands and 17.5% for Bangladesh to about
80% for the Majuro Atoll in the Marshall Islands, given the present
state of protection systems. Large numbers of people also are
affected — for example, about 70 million each in China and
Bangladesh. Many nations face lost capital valuein excess of 10% of
their gross domestic product (GDP). Although annual protection
costs for many nations are relatively modest (about 0.1% of GDP),
the average annual costs to many small island states total several per
cent of GDP. For some island nations, the high cost of providing
storm-surge protection would make it essentially infeasible,

with about 20 kg C/G) and coal with about 25 kg C/G}. The lower

"Switching to renewable sources of energy. Solar, biomass, wind,
hydro and geothermal technologies already are widely used. In
1990, renewable sources of energy contributed about 20% of the
world’s primary energy consumption, most of it fuelwood and
hydropower. Technological advances offer new opportunities and
declining costs for energy from these sources. In the longer term,
renewable sources of energy could meet a major part of the world’s

limited fractions of intermittent generation, and with the addition
of fast-responding backup and storage units, also higher fractions.
Where biomass is sustainably regrown and used to displace fossil
fuels in energy production, net carbon emissions are avoided as
the CO, released in converting the biomass to energy is again fixed

Third, the economic, social and environmental costs of mitigating

"Analyses indicate that a prudent way to deal with climate change is
through a portfolio of actions aimed at mitigation, adaptation and
improvement of knowledge. The appropriate portfolio will differ for
each country. The challenge is not to find the best policy today for
the next 100 years, but to select a prudent strategy and to adjust it
over time in the light of new information.

Earlier mitigation action may increase flexibility in moving toward
stabilization of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases
(UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Article 2). The
choice of abatement paths involves balancing the economic risks
of rapid abatement now (that premature capital stock retirement
will later be proved unnecessary) against the corresponding risk of
delay (that more rapid reduction will then be required, necessitat-
ing premature retirement of future capital stock).

The literature indicates that significant “no-regrets”2 opportunities
are available in most countries and that the risk of aggregate net
damage due to climate change, consideration of risk aversion, and
application of the precautionary principle provide rationales for
action beyond no regrets.

The value of better information about climate change processes
and impacts and society’s responses to them is likely to be great. In
particular, the literature accords high value to information about
climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases and aerosols, climate
change damage functions, and variables such as determinants of

by sovereign states — and the large differences in the circumstances
of different parties raise consequential as well as procedural issues.
Consequential issues relate to outcomes while procedural issues
relate to how decisions are made. In relation to climate change, the
existence of an agreed legal framework involves a collective process
within a negotiated framework (the UNFCCC). Accordingly,
decision-making can be considered within three different categories
of frameworks, each with different implications and with distinct
foci: global optimization (trying to find the globally optimal result),
procedural decision-making (establishing and refining rules of
procedure) and collective decision-making (dealing with
distributional issues and processes involving the interaction of
numerous independent decision makers).

every resource. Nevertheless, sustainable development would require
that use of exhaustible natural resources and environmental degra-

productive assets sufficient to enable future generations to obtain at
least the same standard of living as those alive today. There are differ-

that marginal costs equal marginal benefits. However, both costs

be due to large uncertainties, possible catastrophes with very small
probabilities, or simply because there is no available consistent
methodology for monetizing the effects. In some of these cases, it
may be possible to apply multicriteria analysis. This provides poli-

relevant costs and benefits, estimated within a common framework.

"The literature on the appropriate social discount rate for climate
change analysis can be grouped into two broad categories. One
approach discounts consumption by different generations using the
“social rate of time preference,” which is the sum of the rate of
“pure time preference” (impatience) and the rate of increase of
welfare derived from higher per capita incomes in the future.
Depending upon the values taken for the different parameters, the
discount rate tends to fall between 0.5% and 3.0% per year on a
global basis — using this approach. However, wide variations in
regional discount rates exist, but these may still be consistent with
a particular global average.

"The choice of the social discount rate for public investment projects
is a matter of policy preference but has a major impact on the
economic evaluation of climate change actions.® For example, in
today’s dollars, $1,000 of damage 100 years from now would be
valued at $370 using a 1% discount rate (near the low end of the
range for the first approach) but would be valued at $7.60 using a
5% discount rate (near the upper end of the range for the second
approach). However, in cost-effectiveness analyses of policies over
short time horizons, the impact of using different discount rates is
much smaller. In all areas analysts should specify the discount
rate(s) they use to facilitate comparison and aggregation of results.

"Practical application of traditional cost-benefit analysis to the problem
of climate change is therefore difficult because of the global, regional
and intergenerational nature of the problem. Estimates of the costs of
mitigation options also vary widely. Furthermore, estimates of poten-
tial physical damages due to climate change also vary widely. In
addition, confidence in monetary estimates for important conse
quences (especially nonmarket consequences) is low. These
uncertainties, and theresolution of uncertainty over time, may be deci-
sivefor the choice of strategies to combat climate change. The objective
of decision analysis is to deal with such problems. Furthermore, for
some categories of ecological, cultural and human health impacts,
widely accepted economic concepts of value are not available. To the
extent that someimpacts and measures cannot be valued in monetary
terms, economists augment the traditional cost-benefit analysis
approach with such techniques as multicriteria analysis, permitting
some quantitative expression of the trade-offs to be made. Thesetech-

costs. Nonmarket impacts, such as human health, risk of human
mortality and damage to ecosystems, form an importan
component of available estimates of the social costs of climate

because the value of life has meaning beyond monetary valuation.
It should be noted that the Rio Declaration and Agenda 21 call for
human beings to remain at the centre of sustainable development.
The approach taken to this valuation might affect the scale of
damage reduction strategies. It may be noted that, in virtually all of
the literature discussed in this section, the developing country
statistical lives have not been equally valued at the developed

"Regional or sectoral approaches to estimating the consequences of
climate change include a much wider range of estimates of the net
economic effects. For some areas, damages are estimated to be signif-

countries generally having a diversified, industrial economy and an
educated and flexible labour force, the limited set of published esti-
mates of damages are of the order one to a few per cent of GDP. For
countries generally having a specialized and natural resource-based
economy (eg., heavily emphasizing agriculture or forestry), and a
poorly developed and land-tied labour force, estimates of damages
from the few studies available are several times larger. Small islands
and low-lying coastal areas are particularly vulnerable. Damages from
possible large-scale catastrophes, such as major changes in ocean

"A large potential for cost-effective energy conservation and effi-
ciency improvements in energy supply and energy use exists in
many sectors. These options offer economic and environmental bene-
fitsin addition to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. Various of
these options can be deployed rapidly due to small unit size, modu-
lar design characteristics and low lifetime costs.

The options for CO2 mitigation in energy use include alternative
methods and efficiency improvements, among others in the
construction, residential, commercial, agriculture and industry
sectors. Not all cost-effective strategies are based on new technol-
ogy; some may rely on improved information dissemination and
public education, managerial strategies, pricing policies and insti-
tutional reforms.

Estimates of the technical potential for switching to less carbon-
intensive fuels vary regionally and with the type of measure and
the economic availability of reserves of fossil and alternative fuels.
These estimates also have to take account of potential methane
emissions from leakage of natural gas during production and
distribution.

Renewable energy technologies (e.g., solar, hydroelectric, wind,
traditional and modern biomass, and ocean thermal energy
conversion) have achieved different levels of technical develop-
ment, economic maturity and commercial readiness. The potential
of these energy sources is not fully realized. Cost estimates for these
technologies are sensitive to site-specific characteristics, resource
variability and the form of final energy delivered. These cost esti-
mates vary widely.

Nuclear energy! is a technology that has been deployed for
several decades in many countries. However, a number of factors
have slowed the expansion of nuclear power, including: (a) wary
public perceptions resulting from nuclear accidents, (b) not yet
fully resolved issues concerning reactor safety, proliferation of
fissile material, power-plant decommissioning and long-term
disposal of nuclear waste, as well as, in someinstances, lower-than-
anticipated levels of demand for electricity. Regulatory and siting
difficulties have increased construction lead times, leading to
higher capital costs for this option in some countries. If these
issues, including inter alia the social, political and environmental
aspects mentioned above, can be resolved, nuclear energy has the
potential to increase its present share in worldwide energy
production.

CO, capture and disposal may be ultimately limited for technical
and environmental reasons, because not all forms of disposal ensure
prevention of carbon re-entering the atmosphere.

"If a carbon or carbon-energy tax is used as a policy instrument for
reducing emissions, the taxes could raise substantial revenues, and
how the revenues are distributed could dramatically affect the cost
of mitigation. If the revenues are distributed by reducing
distortionary taxes in the existing system, they will help reduce the
excess burden of the existing tax system, potentially yielding an
additional economic benefit (double dividend). For example, those
European studies which are more optimistic regarding the potential
for tax recycling show lower and, in some instances, slightly
negative costs. Conversely, inefficient recycling of the tax revenues
could increase costs. For example, if the tax revenues are used to
finance government programmes that yield a lower return than the
private sector investments foregone because of the tax, then overall
costs will increase.

"Despite significant differences in views, there is agreement that
energy efficiency gains of perhaps 10-30% above baseline trends
over the next two to three decades can be realized at negative to
zero net cost. (Negative net cost means an economic benefit.) With
longer time horizons, which allow a more complete turnover of
capital stocks, and which give research and development and
market transformation policies a chanceto impact multiple replace-
ment cycles, this potential is much higher. The magnitude of such
“no-regret” potentials depends upon the existence of substantial
market or institutional imperfections that prevent cost-effective
emission reduction measures from occurring. The key question is
then the extent to which such imperfections and barriers can be
removed cost-effectively by policy initiatives such as efficiency
standards, incentives, removal of subsidies, information
programmes and funding of technology transfer.

In contrast, bottom-up models incorporate detailed studies of
the engineering costs of a wide range of available and forecast
technologies, and describe energy consumption in great detail.
However, compared with top-down models, they typically incor-
porate relatively little detail on nonenergy consumer behaviour
and interactions with other sectors of the economy.

This simple characterization of top-down and bottom-up
models is increasingly misleading as more recent versions of each
approach have tended to provide greater detail in the aspects
that were less developed in the past. As a result of this conver-
gence in model structure, model results are tending to converge,
and the remaining differences reflect differences in assumptions
about how rapidly and effectively market institutions adopt cost-
effective new technologies or can be induced to adopt them by
policy interventions.

"Bottom-up studies are more optimistic about the potential for low
or negative cost emission reductions, and the capacity to imple
ment that potential. Such studies show that the costs of reducing
emissions by 20% in developed countries within two to three
decades are negligible to negative. Other bottom-up studies suggest
that there exists a potential for absolute reductions in excess of 50%
in the longer term, without increasing, and perhaps even reducing,
total energy system costs.

"OECD countries. Although it is difficult to generalize, top-down
analyses suggest that the costs of substantial reductions below 1990
levels could be as high as several per cent of GDP. In the specific
case of stabilizing emissions at 1990 levels, most studies estimate
that annual costs in the range of -0.5% of GDP (equivalent to again
of about $60 billion in total for OECD countries at today’s GDP
levels) to 2% of GDP (equivalent to a loss of about $240 billion)
could be reached over the next several decades. However, studies
also show that appropriate timing of abatement measures and the
availability of low-cost alternatives may substantially reduce the
size of the overall bill.

"Developing countries. Analyses suggest that there may be substan-
tial low-cost fossil fuel carbon dioxide emission reduction
opportunities for developing countries. Development pathways that
increase energy efficiency, promote alternative energy technologies,
reduce deforestation, and enhance agricultural productivity and
biomass energy production can be economically beneficial. To
embark upon this pathway may require significant international
cooperation and financial and technology transfers. However, these
are likely to be insufficient to offset rapidly increasing emissions
baselines, associated with increased economic growth and overall
welfare. Stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions is likely to be
costly.

"Policy instruments may be identified at two different levels: those
that might be used by a group of countries and those that might be
used by individual nations unilaterally or to achieve compliance
with a multilateral agreement.
"	Text
"Key uncertainties in current integrated assessments include the
sensitivity of the climate system to changes in greenhouse gas
concentrations, the specification and valuation of impacts where
there are no markets, changes in national and regional demo-
graphics, the choice of discount rates, and assumptions regarding
the cost, availability and diffusion of technologies.
"	Text
"At both the international and national levels, the economic litera-
ture indicates that instruments that provide economic incentives,
such as taxes and tradable quotas/permits, are likely to be more cost-
effective than other approaches. Uniform standards among groups
of countries participating in an international agreement are likely to
be difficult to achieve. However, for one group of countries there
has been agreement on the application of some uniform standards.
"	Text
"Most current integrated assessment models do not reflect the
specific social and economic dynamics of the developing and tran-
sition economies well; for example, none of the existing models
addresses most market imperfections, institutional barriers, or the
operation of the informal sector in these countries. This can lead to
biases in global assessments when mitigation options and impacts
on developing or transition economies are valued as if their
economies operated like those in the developed countries.
"	Text
"The world economy and indeed some individual national
economies suffer from anumber of price distortions which increase
greenhouse gas emissions, such as some agricultural and fuel sub-
sidies and distortions in transport pricing. A number of studies of
this issue indicate that global emission reductions of 4-18%,
together with increases in real incomes, are possible from phasing
out fuel subsidies. For the most part, reducing such distortions could
lower emissions and increase economic efficiency. However, sub-
sidies are often introduced and price distortions maintained for social
and distributional reasons, and they may be difficult to remove.

"Governments may have different sets of criteria for assessing interna-

understandability to the general public, and consistency with

"At the international level, all of the potentially efficient market-

negotiations. A tradable quota system has the disadvantage of
making the marginal cost of emissions uncertain, while a carbon tax

on the level at which emissions are controlled uncertain. The
weight given to the importance of reducing these different types of
uncertainty would be one crucial factor in further evaluating these
alternative instruments. Because of the lack of appropriate scientific
knowledge, there would remain a high degree of uncertainty about
the results of limiting emissions at specific levels. The adoption of

research, tradable quotas, joint implementation (specifically activi-
ties implemented jointly under the pilot phase!4), harmonized
domestic carbon taxes, international carbon taxes, nontradable
quotas and various international standards. If the group did not
include all major greenhouse gas emitters, then there might be a
tendency for fossil fuel use to increase in countries not participating
in this group. This outcome might reduce the international compet-
itiveness of some industries in participating countries as well as the
environmental effectiveness of the countries’ efforts.

"While relatively new, integrated assessment models of climate
change have evolved rapidly. Integrated assessment models tend to
fall into two categories: policy evaluation and policy optimization
models. Policy evaluation models are rich in physical detail and
have been used to analyze the potential for deforestation as a conse-
quence of interactions between demographics, agricultural
productivity and economic growth, and the relationship between
climate change and the extent of potentially malarial regions. Policy
optimization models optimize over key variables (e.g., emission
rates, carbon taxes) to achieve formulated policy goals (e.g., cost
minimization or welfare optimization).

objectives other than cost-effectiveness, such as meeting fiscal
targets. Revenue from carbon taxes or auctioned tradable permits
could be used to replace existing distortionary taxes. The choice of
instruments may also reflect other environmental objectives, such
as reducing non-greenhouse pollution emissions, or increasing
forest cover, or other concerns such as specific impacts on particu-
