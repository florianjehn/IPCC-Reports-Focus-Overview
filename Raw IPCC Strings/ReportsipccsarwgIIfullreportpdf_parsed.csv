"In 1992, the Panel reorganized its Working Groups II and III
and committed itself to complete a Second Assessment in
1995, not only updating the information on the same range of
topics as in the First Assessment, but also including the new
subject area of technical issues related to the economic aspects
of climate change. We applaud the IPCC for producing its
Second Assessment Report (SAR) as scheduled. We are con-
vinced that the SAR, as the earlier IPCC reports, will become
a standard work of reference, widely used by policymakers,
scientists, and other experts.
"	Text
"This volume, which forms part of the SAR, has been produced
by Working Group II of the IPCC, and focuses on potential
impacts of climate change, adaptive responses, and measures
that could mitigate future emissions. It consists of 25 chapters
covering a wide range of ecological systems and socioeconomic
sectors and activities. It also includes brief descriptions of three
appendices—two sets of guidelines or methodologies for assess-
ing the potential efficacy of adaptation and mitigation strategies,
and an inventory of technology databases and information. The
appendices themselves have been or are being published in full
as separate stand-alone volumes.

"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was
jointly established by the World Meteorological Organization
and the United Nations Environment Programme in 1988, in
order to (i) assess available scientific information on climate
change, (ii) assess the environmental and socioeconomic
impacts of climate change, and (iii) formulate response strate-
gies. The IPCC First Assessment Report was completed in
August 1990, and served as the basis for negotiating the UN
Framework Convention on Climate Change. The IPCC also
completed its 1992 Supplement and “Climate Change 1994;
Radiative Forcing of Climate Change and An Evaluation of the
IPCC IS92 Emission Scenarios” to assist the Convention
process further.

"pleased to note here the very special efforts made by the IPCC
in ensuring the participation of scientists and other experts
from the developing and transitional economy countries in its
activities, in particular in the writing, reviewing, and revising
of its reports. The scientists and experts from the developed,
developing, and transitional economy countries have given of
their time very generously, and governments have supported
them in the enormous intellectual and physical effort required,
often going substantially beyond reasonable demands of duty.
Without such conscientious and professional involvement,
the IPCC would be greatly impoverished. We express to all
these scientists and experts, and the governments who sup-
ported them, our grateful and sincere appreciation for their
commitment.

"In June 1993, Working Group II of the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was asked to review the
state of knowledge concerning the impacts of climate change
on physical and ecological systems, human health, and socio-
economic sectors. Working Group II also was charged with
reviewing available information on the technical and econom-

strategies.

"This volume responds to this charge and represents a tremen-
dous achievement—the coordinated contributions of well over
a thousand individuals from over 50 developed and developing
countries and a dozen international organizations. It includes
introductory “primers” on ecological systems and energy pro-
duction and use; 25 chapters, covering both vulnerability to
climate change and options for reducing emissions or enhanc-
ing sinks; and three appendices that inventory mitigation tech-
nologies and delineate methodologies for assessing impacts/
adaptations and mitigation options.

"The chapters provide an overview of developments in our sci-
entific understanding since the first IPCC assessments of
impacts and response options in 1990, and the supplemental
IPCC assessments of 1992. Uncertainties are described, with
an eye for identifying both policy significance and research
opportunities. In presenting this information, each team of
authors has sought to communicate its findings in way that is
useful to decisionmakers, research managers, and peers within
their field of research; we hope that these audiences, in addi-
tion to educators and the general public, will find this volume
useful.

"From the earliest stages of the process, participants in the
assessment understood the need to confront the fact that confi-
dence in regional projections of temperature, precipitation, soil
moisture, and other climate parameters important to impacts
models remains low, that uncertainty increases as scale
decreases, that patterns of climate change are interwoven with
climate variability, and that regional patterns are likely to be
affected by both greenhouse gases and anthropogenic aerosols,
the latter of which are only now beginning to be incorporated
into transient GCM simulations. To provide useful information
to decisionmakers, Working Group II needed to find a way to
distinguish between uncertainties arising from remaining ques-
tions about the responses of systems to a given level or rate of
climate change and uncertainties related to the regional-scale cli-
mate projections themselves. Consequently, Working Group II
decided to focus on assessing the sensitivity and vulnerability of
systems to a range of climate changes, and only then, having

"How sensitive is a particular system to climate
change—that is, in simplified terms, how will a sys-
tem respond to given changes in climate? Given the
wide range of systems reviewed in this assessment,
these relationships are described in a variety of forms,
ranging from specification of quantitative functional
relationships for some systems (e.g., climate-yield
models for agriculture, rainfall-runoff models for
hydrological systems, models of energy demand for
heating or cooling driven by temperature change) to
more qualitative relationships for other systems.
How adaptable is a particular system to climate
change—that is, to what degree are adjustments pos-
sible in practices, processes, or structures of systems
in response to projected or actual changes of climate?
This issue is important for both ecological and social
systems because it is critical to recognize that both
types of systems have capacities that will enable them
to resist adverse consequences of new conditions or to
capitalize on: new opportunities. Adaptation can be
spontaneous or planned, and can be carried out in
response to or in anticipation of changes.

Finally, how vulnerable is a system to climate
change—that is, how susceptible is it to damage or
harm? Vulnerability defines the extent to which cli-
mate change may damage or harm a system. It
depends not only on a system’s sensitivity but also on
its ability to adapt to new climate conditions. Both the
magnitude and rate of climate change are important in
determining the sensitivity, adaptability, and vulnera-
bility of a system.

"High Confidence—This category denotes wide agree-
ment, based on multiple findings through multiple
- lines of investigation. In other words, there was a high
degree of consensus among the authors based on the
existence of substantial evidence in support of the
conclusion.
Medium Confidence—This category indicates that
there is a consensus, but not a strong one, in support
of the conclusion. This ranking could be applied to a
situation in which an hypothesis or conclusion is sup-
ported by a fair amount of information, but not a suf-
ficient amount to convince all participating authors,
or where other less plausible hypotheses cannot yet be
completely ruled out.
Low Confidence—This category is reserved for cases
when lead authors were highly uncertain about a par-
ticular conclusion. This uncertainty could be a reflec-
tion of a lack of consensus or the existence of serious
competing hypotheses, each with adherents and evi-
dence to support their positions. Alternatively, this
ranking could result from the existence of extremely
limited information to support an initial plausible idea
or hypothesis.

a nation or the world community cannot position itself better

protect against potentially costly future outcomes. Delaying
such measures may leave a nation or the world poorly pre-

"Policymakers are faced with responding to the risks posed by
anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases in the face of
significant scientific uncertainties. It is appropriate to con-
sider these uncertainties in the context of information indi-
cating that climate-induced environmental changes cannot
be reversed quickly, if at all, due to the Jong time scales
associated with the climate system (see Box 2). Decisions
taken during the next few years may limit the range of pos-
sible policy options in the future because high near-term
emissions would require deeper reductions in the future to
meet any given target concentration. Delaying action might
reduce the overall costs of mitigation because of potential
technological advances but could increase both the rate and
the eventual magnitude of climate change, hence the adapta-

limited in scope. Although our knowledge has increased sig-
nificantly during the last decade, and qualitative estimates can
be developed, quantitative projections of the impacts of cli-
mate change on any particular system at any particular location
are difficult because regional-scale climate change predictions
are uncertain; our current understanding of many critical
processes is limited; and systems are subject to multiple cli-
matic and non-climatic stresses, the interactions of which are
not always linear or additive. Most impact studies have
assessed how systems would respond to climate change result-

"changes in most ecological and social systems will prove
extremely difficult in the coming decades. This is because of
the complexity of these systems, their many non-linear feed-

change simultaneously. The development of a baseline project-
ing future conditions without climate change is crucial, for it is
this baseline against which all projected impacts are measured.
As future climate extends beyond the boundaries of empirical
knowledge (i.e., the documented impacts of climate variation
in the past), it becomes more likely that actual outcomes will
include surprises and unanticipated rapid changes.

"Vulnerability increases as adaptive capacity decreases. The
vulnerability of human health and socioeconomic systems—
and, to a lesser extent, ecological systems—depends upon eco-
nomic circumstances and institutional infrastructure. This
implies that systems typically are more vulnerable in develop-
ing countries where economic and institutional circumstances
are less favorable. People who live on arid or semi-arid lands,
in low-lying coastal areas, in water-limited or flood-prone
areas, or on small islands are particularly vulnerable to climate
change. Some regions have become more vulnerable to haz-
ards such as storms, floods, and droughts as a result of increas-
ing population density in sensitive areas such as river basins
and coastal plains. Human activities, which fragment many
landscapes, have increased the vulnerability of lightly man-
aged and unmanaged ecosystems. Fragmentation limits natural
adaptation potential and the potential effectiveness of measures
to assist adaptation in these systems, such as the provision of
migration corridors. A changing climate’s near-term effects on
ecological and socioeconomic systems most likely will result
from changes in the intensity and seasonal and geographic dis-
tribution of common weather hazards such as storms, floods,
and droughts. In most of these examples, vulnerability can be
reduced by strengthening adaptive capacity.

from various factors, including climatic variations and human

if the environment becomes drier and the soil becomes further
degraded through erosion and compaction. Adaptation to
drought and desertification may rely on the development of

Coastal Systems. Coastal systems are economically and eco-
logically important and are expected to vary widely in their
response to changes in climate and sea level. Climate change and
a rise in sea level or changes in storms or storm surges could
result in the erosion of shores and associated habitat, increased
salinity of estuaries and freshwater aquifers, altered tidal ranges
in rivers and bays, changes in sediment and nutrient transport, a
change in the pattern of chemical and microbiological contami-
nation in coastal areas, and increased coastal flooding. Some
coastal ecosystems are particularly at risk, including saltwater
marshes, mangrove ecosystems, coastal wetlands, coral reefs,
coral atolls, and river deltas. Changes in these ecosystems would
have major negative effects on tourism, freshwater supplies,
fisheries, and biodiversity. Such impacts would add to modifica-
tions in the functioning of coastal oceans and inland waters that
already have resulted from pollution, physical modification, and
material inputs due to human activities.

Oceans. Climate change will lead to changes in sea level,
increasing it on average, and also could lead to altered ocean
circulation, vertical mixing, wave climate, and reductions in
sea-ice cover. As a result, nutrient availability, biological pro-
ductivity, the structure and functions of marine ecosystems,
and heat and carbon storage capacity may be affected, with
important feedbacks to the climate system. These changes
would have implications for coastal regions, fisheries, tourism
and recreation, transport, off-shore structures, and communica-
tion. Paleoclimatic data and model experiments suggest that
abrupt climatic changes can occur if freshwater influx from the
movement and melting of sea ice or ice sheets significantly
weakens global thermohaline circulation.

"More Efficient Conversion of Fossil Fuels. New technology
offers considerably increased conversion efficiencies. For
example, the efficiency of power production can be increased
from the present world average of about 30% to more than
60% in the longer term. Also, the use of combined heat and
power production replacing separate production of power and
heat—whether for process heat or space heating—offers a sig-
nificant rise in fuel conversion efficiency.

investment and not on potential retrofitting of existing capital
stock to use less carbon-intensive forms of primary energy. It
is technically possible to realize deep emissions reductions in
the energy supply sector in step with the normal timing of
investments to replace infrastructure and equipment as it wears
out or becomes obsolete. Many options for achieving these
deep reductions will also decrease the emissions of sulfur diox-
ide, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds.
Promising approaches, not ordered according to priority, are

"Switching to Low-Carbon Fossil Fuels and Suppressing
Emissions. Switching from coal to oil or natural gas, and from
oil to natural gas, can reduce emissions. Natural gas has the
lowest CO, emissions per unit of energy of all fossil fuels at
about 14 kg C/GJ, compared to oil with about 20 kg C/GJ and
coal with about 25 kg C/GJ. The lower carbon-containing fuels
can, in general, be converted with higher efficiency than coal.
Large resources of natural gas exist in many areas. New, low
capital cost, highly efficient combined-cycle technology has
reduced electricity costs considerably in some areas. Natural
gas could potentially replace oil in the transportation sector.

"Process-related greenhouse gases including CO,, CH,, N,O,
halocarbons, and SF, are released during manufacturing and
industrial processes, such as the production of iron, steel, alu-
minum, ammonia, cement, and other materials. Large reduc-
tions are possible in some cases. Measures include modifying
production processes, eliminating solvents, replacing feed-
stocks, materials substitution, increased recycling, and reduced
consumption of greenhouse gas-intensive materials. Capturing
and utilizing CH, from landfills and sewage treatment facilities
and lowering the leakage rate of halocarbon refrigerants from
mobile and stationary sources also can lead to significant
greenhouse gas emission reductions.

EJ in 2025 without new measures. Projected energy use could
be reduced by about a quarter to 126-170 EJ by 2025 without
diminishing services through the use of energy efficient tech-
nology. The potential for greenhouse gas emission reductions
is larger. Technical changes might include reduced heat trans-
fers through building structures and more efficient space-con-

Ambient temperatures in urban areas can be reduced through
increased vegetation and greater reflectivity of building sur-

"Transportation, Energy use in 1990 was estimated to be
61-65 EJ, and is projected to grow to 90-140 EJ in 2025 with-
out new measures. Projected energy use in 2025 could be
reduced by about a third to 60~100 EJ through vehicles using
very efficient drive-trains, lightweight construction, and low
air-resistance design, without compromising comfort and per-
formance. Further energy-use reductions are possible through
the use of smaller vehicles; altered land-use patterns, transport
systems, mobility patterns, and lifestyles; and shifting to less
energy-intensive transport modes. Greenhouse gas emissions
per unit of energy used could be reduced through the use of
alternative fuels and electricity from renewable sources. These
measures, taken together, provide the opportunity for reducing
global transport energy-related greenhouse gas emissions by
as much as 40% of projected emissions by 2025. Actions to
reduce energy-related greenhouse gas emissions from trans-
port can simultaneously address other problems such as local
air pollution.

"Industry. Energy use in 1990 was estimated to be 98-117 EJ,
and is projected to grow to 140-242 EJ in 2025 without new
measures. Countries differ widely in their current industrial ener-
gy use and energy-related greenhouse gas emission trends.
Industrial sector energy-related greenhouse gas emissions in
most industrialized countries are expected to be stable or
decreasing as a result of industrial restructuring and technologi-
cal innovation, whereas industrial emissions in developing coun-
tries are projected to increase mainly as a result of industrial
growth. The short-term potential for energy-efficiency improve-
ments in the manufacturing sector of major industrial countries
is estimated to be 25%. The potential for greenhouse gas emis-
sion reductions is larger. Technologies and measures for reduc-
ing energy-related emissions from this sector include improving
efficiency (e.g., energy and materials savings, cogeneration,
energy cascading, steam recovery, and use of more efficient
motors and other electrical devices); recycling materials and
switching to those with lower greenhouse gas emissions; and
developing processes that use less energy and materials.

Another approach to decarbonization uses fossil fuel feed-
stocks to make hydrogen-rich fuels. Both approaches generate
a byproduct stream of CO, that could be stored, for example,
in depleted natural gas fields. The future availability of con-
version technologies such as fuel cells that can efficiently use
hydrogen would increase the relative attractiveness of the lat-

prices, one or more of the variants would plausibly be capable
of providing the demanded energy services at estimated costs
that are approximately the same as estimated future costs for
current conventional energy, It is not possible to identify a

"Deep reductions of CO, emissions from energy sup-
ply systems are technically possible within 50 to 100
years, using alternative strategies.

Many combinations of the options identified in this
assessment could reduce global CO, emissions from
fossil fuels from about 6 Gt C in 1990 to about 4 Gt
C/yr by 2050, and to about 2 Gt C/yr by 2100 (see
Figure 6). Cumulative CO, emissions, from 1990 to
2100, would range from about 450 to about 470 Gt C
in the alternative LESS constructions.

Higher energy efficiency is underscored for achieving
deep reductions in CO, emissions, for increasing the
flexibility of supply side combinations, and for reduc-
ing overall energy system costs.

Interregional trade in energy grows in the LESS con-

"Switching to Renewable Sources of Energy. Solar, biomass,
wind, hydro, and geothermal technologies already are widely
used, In 1990, renewable sources of energy contributed about 20%
of the world’s primary energy consumption, most of it fuelwood
and hydropower, Technological advances offer new opportunities
and declining costs for energy from these sources. In the longer
term, renewable sources of energy could meet a major part of the
world’s demand for energy. Power systems can easily accommo-
date limited fractions of intermittent generation, and with the addi-
tion of fast-responding backup and storage units, also higher frac-
tions. Where biomass is sustainably regrown and used to displace
fossil fuels in energy production, net carbon emissions are avoid-
ed as the CO, released in converting the biomass to energy is again
fixed in biomass through photosynthesis. If the development of
biomass energy can be carried out in ways that effectively address
concerns about other environmental issues and competition with
other land uses, biomass could make major contributions in both
the electricity and fuels markets, as well as offering prospects of
increasing rural employment and income.

Natural Resources. A growing population and
expanding economy will increase the demand for land

intensified patterns of resource use. Land and other
resources could also be required for mitigation of
greenhouse gas emissions. Agricultural productivity
improvements throughout the world and especially in
developing countries would increase availability of
land for production of biomass energy.
Geoengineering Options. Some geoengineering
approaches to counterbalance greenhouse gas-induced
climate change have been suggested (e.g., putting
solar radiation reflectors in space or injecting sulfate
aerosols into the atmosphere to mimic the cooling
influence of volcanic eruptions). Such approaches
generally are likely to be ineffective, expensive to sus-

"Mitigation depends on reducing barriers to the diffusion and
transfer of technology, mobilizing financial resources, support-
ing capacity building in developing countries, and other
approaches to assist in the implementation of behavioral
changes and technological opportunities in all regions of the
globe. The optimum mix of policies will vary from country to
country, depending upon political structure and societal recep-
tiveness. The leadership of national governments in applying
these policies will contribute to responding to adverse conse-
quences of climate change. Governments can choose policies
that facilitate the penetration of less greenhouse gas-intensive
technologies and modified consumption patterns. Indeed,
many countries have extensive experience with a variety of
policies that can accelerate the adoption of such technologies.
This experience comes from efforts over the past 20 to 30 years
to achieve improved energy efficiency, reduce the environ-
mental impacts of agricultural policies, and meet conservation
and environmental goals unrelated to climate change. Policies
to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions appear more easily
implemented when they are designed to address other concerns
that impede sustainable development (e.g., air pollution and
soil erosion). A number of policies, some of which may need
regional or international agreement, can facilitate the penetra-

risen by about 30%, methane (CH,) by more than 100%, and
nitrous oxide (N,O) by about 15%. These gases now are at
greater concentrations than at any time in the past 160,000
years (the period for which scientists can reconstruct historical
climates and atmospheric compositions by analyzing ice-core
data). The combustion of fossil fuels and, to a lesser extent,
changes in land use account for anthropogenic CO, emissions.
Agriculture is responsible for nearly 50% of human-generated
CH, emissions and about 70% of anthropogenic N,O emis-
sions. Although CO, emissions far exceed those of CH, and
N,O, the global warming potentials of these latter two gases
are relatively high. Hence, they represent significant contribu-
tors to the anthropogenic greenhouse effect. CO, has con-
tributed about 65% of the combined radiative effects of the
long-lived gases over the past 100 years; CH, and N,O have
contributed about 20 and 5%, respectively.

the different economic and institutional circumstances among

water resources) are all vital to human development and well-
being, and are all sensitive to changes in climate. Whereas many
regions are likely to experience the adverse effects of climate
change—some of which are potentially irreversible—some
effects of climate change are likely to be beneficial. Hence, dif-
ferent segments of society can expect to confront a variety of
changes and the need to adapt to them. The following conclu-
sions apply to many ecological and socioeconomic systems:
"	Text
"Human-induced climate change adds an important
new stress. Human-induced climate change represents
an important additional stress, particularly to the many
ecological and socioeconomic systems already affect-
ed by pollution, increasing resource demands, and
nonsustainable management practices. The most vul-
nerable systems are those with the greatest sensitivity
to climate changes and the least adaptability.

Most systems are sensitive to climate change.

Natural ecological systems, socioeconomic systems,

and human health are all sensitive to both the magni-

tude and the rate of climate change.

— Natural ecosystems. The composition and geo-
graphic distiibution of many ecosystems will shift
as individual species respond to changes in cli-
mate; there will likely be reductions in biological
diversity and in the goods and services that ecosys-
tems provide society—for example, sources of
food, fiber, medicines, recreation and tourism, and
ecological services such as nutrient cycling, waste
assimilation, and controlling water runoff and soil
erosion. Large amounts of carbon could be
released into the atmosphere during periods of
high forest mortality in the transition from one for-
est type to another.

- Food security. Some regions, especially in the
tropics and subtropics, may suffer significant
adverse consequences for food security, even
though the effect of climate change on global
food production may prove small to moderate.

— Sustainable economic development. Some countries
will face threats to sustainable development from
losses of human habitat due to sea-level rise, reduc-
tions in water quality and quantity, disruptions from
extreme events, and an increase in human diseases
(particularly vector-borne diseases such as malaria).

"Impacts are difficult to quantify, and existing stud-
ies are limited in scope. While our knowledge has
increased significantly during the last decade and
qualitative estimates can be developed, quantitative
projections of the impacts of climate change on any
particular system at any particular location are diffi-
cult because regional scale climate change projections
are uncertain; our current understanding of many crit-
ical processes is limited; and systems are subject to
multiple climatic and non-climatic stresses, the inter-
actions of which are not always linear or additive.
Most impact studies have assessed how systems
would respond to climate change resulting from an
arbitrary doubling of equivalent atmospheric CO,
concentrations. Furthermore, very few studies have
considered dynamic responses to steadily increasing
greenhouse gas concentrations; fewer still have exam-
ined the consequences of increases beyond a doubling
of equivalent atmospheric CO, concentrations or
assessed the implications of multiple stress factors.
Successful adaptation depends upon technological
advances, institutional arrangements, availability of
financing, and information exchange. Technological
advances generally have increased adaptation options
for managed systems such as agriculture and water sup-
ply. However, many regions of the world currently
have limited access to these technologies and appropri-
ate information. The efficacy and cost-effective use of
adaptation strategies will depend upon the availability
of financial resources, technology transfer, and cultur-
al, educational, managerial, institutional, legal, and reg-
ulatory practices, both domestic and international in
scope. Incorporating climate-change concerns into
resource-use and development decisions and plans for
regularly scheduled investments in infrastructure will
facilitate adaptation.

Vulnerability increases as adaptive capacity
decreases. The vulnerability of human health and
socioeconomic systems—and to a lesser extent eco-
logical systems—depends upon economic circum-
stances and institutional infrastructure. This implies
that systems typically are more vulnerable in devel-
oping countries where economic and institutional cir-
cumstances are less favorable. People who live on
arid or semi-arid lands, in low-lying coastal areas, in
water-limited or flood-prone areas, or on small islands
are particularly vulnerable to climate change. Some
regions have become more vulnerable to hazards such
as storms, floods, and droughts as a result of increas-
ing population density in sensitive areas such as river
basins and coastal plains. Human activities, which
fragment many landscapes, have increased the vul-
nerability of lightly managed and unmanaged ecosys-
tems. Fragmentation limits natural adaptation poten-
tial and the potential effectiveness of measures to
assist adaptation in these systems, such as the provi-
sion of migration corridors. A changing climate’s

intensity and seasonal and geographic distribution of
common weather hazards such as storms, floods, and

be reduced by strengthening adaptive capacity.
Detection will be difficult and unexpected changes
cannot be ruled out. Unambiguous detection of cli-
mate-induced changes in most ecological and social
systems will prove extremely difficult in the coming
decades. This is because of the complexity of these
systems, their many non-linear feedbacks, and their
sensitivity to a large number of climatic and non-cli-
matic factors, all of which are expected to continue to
change simultaneously. The development of a base-
line projecting future conditions without climate
change is crucial, for it is this baseline against which
all projected impacts are measured. The more that
future climate extends beyond the boundaries of
empirical knowledge (i.e., the documented impacts of
climate variation in the past), the more likely that
actual outcomes will include surprises and unantici-
pated rapid changes.

Further research and monitoring are essential.
Enhanced support for research and monitoring,
including cooperative efforts from national, interna-
tional, and multilateral institutions, is essential in
order to improve significantly regional-scale climate
projections; to understand the responses of human
health, ecological, and socioeconomic systems to
changes in climate and other stress factors; and to

"Tropical forests. It is likely that temperature increases will have a smaller impact on tropical forests than on temperate

However, tropical forests are very sensitive to the amount and seasonality of rainfall. In general, human activities caus-
ing conversion to other land-cover types will likely affect tropical forests more than climate change. If CO, fertilization

is important, it may lead to a gain in net carbon storage because of the slow rate at which the associated soil respiration
increases in this zone.

"Boreal forests. As warming is expected to be particularly large at high latitudes, and as boreal forests are more strongly
affected by temperature than forests in other latitudinal zones, climatic change is likely to have its greatest impact on
boreal forests. Increased fire frequency and pest outbreaks are likely to decrease the average age, biomass and carbon
store, with greatest impact at the southern boundary, where the boreal coniferous forest is likely to give way to temperate
zone pioneer species or grasslands. Northern treelines are likely to advance slowly into regions currently occupied by
tundra. The NPP of forests that are not limited by water availability is likely to increase in response to warming, partly
mediated by increased nitrogen mineralization. However, there may be a net loss of carbon from the ecosystem because
of associated increases in soil organic matter decomposition.

"A variety of biological, chemical, and physical factors affect
forest ecosystems. Forest productivity and the number of

water availability (either drought or waterlogging). Models
project that a sustained increase of 1°C in global mean temper-
ature is sufficient to cause changes in regional climates that
will affect the growth and regeneration capacity of forests in
many regions. In several instances, this will alter the function
and composition of forests significantly. As a consequence of
possible changes in temperature and water availability under

already poses a major problem in many countries. Current gen-

climate change will increase drought and result in rainfall of
higher intensity and more irregular distribution. This could
increase the potential for land degradation, including loss of
organic matter and nutrients, weakening of soil structure,
decline in soil stability, and an increase in soil erosion and
salinization. Areas that experience increased rainfall and soil
moisture will benefit from the opportunities for more flexible
use. However, they may experience stronger leaching, leading
to increased acidification and loss of nutrients. In appropriate
situations, additions of lime and fertilizers or conservation

"Desertification, as defined by the United Nations Convention
to Combat Desertification, is land degradation in arid, semi-
arid, and dry sub-humid areas resulting from various factors,
including climatic variations and human activities. Droughts
may trigger or accelerate desertification by reducing the
growth of important plant species. Grazing can strip the land of
its cover under these conditions. However, the amount of pre-
cipitation needed to sustain growth varies with the tempera-
ture, soil moisture capacity, and species. Desertification is
more likely to become irreversible if the environment becomes
drier and the soil becomes further degraded through erosion
and compaction, Adaptation to drought and desertification may
rely on the development of diversified production systems,
such as agroforestry techniques and ranching of animals better
adapted to local conditions. However, adaptation also needs
political, social, extension service, and educational inputs.

Wetlands exist on every continent (except Antarctica), in both

Earth’s land surface. Human activities such as agricultural
development, construction of dams and embankments, and
peat mining already threaten these ecosystems and have con-

wetlands during the last century. Non-tidal (primarily inland)
wetlands provide refuge and breeding grounds for many

an important repository of biodiversity; control floods and

"Although the effects on lake and stream ecosystems will vary
with the distribution of climate changes, some general conclu-
sions emerge. Warming would have the greatest biological
effects at high latitudes, where biological productivity would
increase, and at the low-latitude boundaries of cold- and cool-
water species ranges, where appropriate thermal habitat would
become more fragmented and extinctions would be greatest.
The rate of climatic warming may exceed the rate of shifts in
species ranges. Warming of the larger and deeper temperate
lakes will increase their productivity and thermal habitat favor-
able for native fishes, whereas warming of shallow lakes and
streams could lead to increased anoxia and reduction in suit-
able habitat. Deep tropical lakes may become less productive
as thermal stratification intensifies and nutrients become
trapped below the mixed layer. Lakes and streams in dry, evap-
orative drainages and in basins with small catchments are most
sensitive to changes in precipitation and would experience the
most severe water-level declines if precipitation were to
decrease. For many lakes and streams, the most severe effects
of climate change may be the exacerbation of current stresses

some low-lying coastal areas, deltas, and small islands. Water
availability already falls below 1,000 m3 per person per year—
a common benchmark for water scarcity—in a number of
countries (e.g., Kuwait, Jordan, Israel, Rwanda, Somalia,
Algeria, Kenya). Other nations likely to fall below this bench-

"Achange in the volume and distribution of water would affect
all of a region’s water uses. The impacts, however, will depend
also on the actions of water users and managers, who will
respond not only to climate change but also to population
growth and changes in demands, technology, and economic,
social, and legislative conditions. In some cases—particularly
in wealthier countries with integrated water-management sys-

change at minimal cost. In many others however—particularly
those regions that already are water-limited—substantial eco-
nomic, social, and environmental costs could occur. Water
resources in arid and semi-arid zones are particularly sensitive
to climate variations because of low-volume total runoff and
infiltration and because relatively small changes in temperature
and precipitation can have large effects on runoff. Irrigation—
the largest use of water in many countries—will be the first
activity affected in regions where precipitation decreases. This
is because in some regions water used for agriculture costs less
than water for domestic and industrial activities. During water
shortages, allocations to agriculture will most likely decline
before allocations to those other uses.

"Relatively small changes in temperature and precipitation,
together with the non-linear effects on evapotranspiration and
soil moisture, can result in relatively large changes in runoff,
especially in arid and semi-arid lands. High-latitude regions
may experience increased runoff due to increased precipitation,
whereas runoff may decrease at lower latitudes due to the com-
bined effects of increased evapotranspiration and decreased pre-
cipitation, Even in areas where models project a precipitation
increase, higher evaporation rates may lead to reduced runoff.
More intense rainfall would tend to increase runoff and the risk
of flooding, although the magnitude of the effect would depend
on both an area’s rainfall change and its catchment characteris-
tics. This effect could be exacerbated in regions where extensive
reductions occur in vegetation (e.g., deforestation, overgrazing,
logging). Winter snowfall and spring snowmelt determine the
flow rates of rivers and streams in many continental and moun-
tain areas. Should the climate change and the proportion of pre-
cipitation falling as snow decrease, widespread reductions in
spring runoff and increases in winter runoff seem likely. These
changes would have consequences for water storage and deliv-

These studies presently do not include changes in insects, weeds,

water supply caused by alterations in river flows and irrigation.
Moreover, the studies have considered only a limited set of adap-

have adapted to changing economic conditions, technology and

remains regarding whether the rate of climate change and required
adaptation would add significantly to the disruptions resulting
from other socioeconomic or environmental changes. Adaptation
to climate change via new crops and crop varieties, improved
water-management and irrigation systems, and information (e.g.,
optimal planting times) will prove important in limiting negative
effects and taking advantage of beneficial changes in climate. The
extent of adaptation depends in part on the cost of the measures
used, particularly in developing countries; access to technology
and skills; the rate of climate change; and constraints such as water
availability, soil characteristics, topography, and the genetic diver-
sity bred into crops. The incremental costs of these adaptation
strategies could create a serious burden for some developing coun-

some countries. There are significant uncertainties about the
capacity of different regions to adapt successfully to projected cli-

"Although marine fisheries production will remain about the
same globally, projections indicate that higher latitude fresh-
water and aquaculture production will increase. This assumes,
however, that natural climate variability and the structure and
strength of ocean currents remains unchanged. Alterations in
either would have significant impacts on the distribution of
major fish stocks, rather than on global production. Positive
effects (e.g., longer growing seasons, lower natural winter
mortality, and faster growth rates in higher latitudes) may be
offset by negative factors such as changes in established repro-
ductive patterns, migration routes, and ecosystem relation-
ships. Climate change can be expected to have the greatest
impact on the following (in decreasing order): (i) freshwater
fisheries in small rivers and lakes in regions with larger tem-
perature and precipitation change; (ii) fisheries within exclu-
sive economic zones, particularly where access regulations
artificially reduce the mobility of fisher groups and fishing
fleets, thus their capacity to adjust to fluctuations in stock dis-
tribution and abundance; (iii) fisheries in large rivers and lakes;
(iv) fisheries in estuaries, particularly where there are species
without migration or spawn dispersal paths, or estuaries affect-
ed by sea-level rise or decreased river flow; and (v) high-seas
fisheries. Where rapid change occurs due to physical forcing
(e.g., changes in currents and natural variability), production
will usually favor smaller, low-priced, opportunistic species
that discharge large numbers of eggs over long periods. Loss of
coastal wetlands could cause a loss of nurseries and have sig-

"Climate change clearly will increase the vulnerability of some
coastal populations to flooding and erosional land loss.
Estimates put about 46 million people per year currently at risk
of flooding due to storm surges. This estimate results from
multiplying the total number of people currently living in areas
potentially affected by ocean flooding by the probability of
flooding at these locations in any year, given the present pro-
tection levels and population density. In the absence of adapta-
tion measures, a 50-cm sea-level rise would increase this num-
ber to about 92 million; a 1-m sea-level rise would raise it to
118 million. If one incorporates anticipated population growth,
the estimates increase substantially. Some small island nations
and other countries will confront greater vulnerability because
their existing sea and coastal defense systems are less well-
established. Countries with higher population densities would
be more vulnerable. For these countries, sea-level rise could

Group I estimates for 2100; it should be noted, however, that sea
level is actually projected to continue to rise in future centuries
beyond 2100. Studies using this 1-m projection show a particu-

Uruguay, 1% for Egypt, 6% for the Netherlands, and 17.5% for

nations face lost capital value in excess of 10% of GDP.
Although annual adaptation/protection costs for many nations
are relatively modest (about 0.1% of GDP), the average annual
costs to many small island states total several percent of GDP.
For some island nations, the high cost of providing storm-surge
protection would make it essentially infeasible, especially given
the limited availability of capital for investment.

Climate changes, however, could occur suddenly. Uncertainty

fusion, and transfer in all sectors, including the energy, industry,
transportation, residential/commercial, and agricultural/forestry
sectors. By the year 2100, the world’s commercial energy system
in effect will be replaced at least twice, offering opportunities to
change the energy system without premature retirement of capital
stock; significant amounts of capital stock in the industrial, com-

that the analyses of Working Group II do not attempt to quantify

about 25% can be obtained in industrialized
nations by improving efficiency, recycling materi-

40% by 2025 could be achieved by changing
vehicle engineering to use mote efficient drive
trains and materials; reducing the size of vehi-
cles; switching to alternative fuels; reducing the
level of passenger and freight transport activity
by altering land-use patterns, transport systems,
mobility patterns, and lifestyles; and shifting to
less energy-intensive transportation modes.

—  Commercial/residential sector. Cuts of 50% in
the projected growth in emissions over the next
35 years—and deeper cuts in the longer term—
could be achieved by more efficient lighting,
appliances, and space-conditioning systems;
reduced heat transfers through walls, ceilings,

as automatic sensors.

— Energy supply. Options include more efficient con-
version of fossil fuels (from the present world aver-
age for electric power generation of about 30% to
more than 60% in the longer term); switching from
high- to low-carbon fossil fuels (coal to oil to gas);
decarbonization of flue gases and fuels, coupled
with CO, storage; increasing the use of nuclear
energy; and increased use of modern renewable
sources of energy (e.g., biomass for production of
electricity and liquid/gaseous fuels, wind, and
solar). In the longer term, renewable sources of
energy could meet the major part of the world’s
demand for energy as technological advances offer
new opportunities and declining costs.

— Land management. A number of measures could
conserve and sequester substantial amounts of
carbon (approximately 60-90 Gt C in the forestry
sector alone) over the next 50 years, including
slowing deforestation, enhancing natural forest
generation, establishing tree plantations, and pro-
moting agroforestry. Significant additional
amounts could be sequestered by altering man-
agement of agricultural soils and rangelands, and
by restoring degraded agricultural lands and
rangelands. Other practices, such as improving
efficiency of fertilizer use or the diet of domesti-
cated ruminants, could reduce emissions. of other
greenhouse gases such as CH, and N,O.

Based on aggregated national energy balances, 385 EJ of prima-

release of 6 Gt C as CO,. Of this, 279 EJ was delivered to end

Despite different assessment approaches, the resulting ranges

closely to GDP growth, although there is also a strong negative
correlation with fuel prices (see Figures 13 and 14), However,
projected energy use in 2025 could be reduced by about a third
to 60-100 EJ through vehicles using very efficient drive-trains,

compromising comfort and performance. Further energy-use
reductions are possible through the use of smaller vehicles;
altered land-use patterns, transport systems, mobility patterns,

modes. Greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy used could
be reduced through the use of alternative fuels and electricity

"’ Greenhouse gas reductions in the use of fossil fuels

More-efficient conversion of fossil fuels. New
technology offers considerably increased conver-
sion efficiencies. For example, the efficiency of
power production can be increased from the pre-
sent world average of about 30% to more than
60% in the longer term. Also, the use of com-
bined heat and power production replacing sepa-
rate production of power and heat—whether for
process heat or space heating—offers a signifi-
cant rise in fuel conversion efficiency.

Switching to low-carbon fossil fuels and sup-
pressing emissions. Switching from coal to oil or
natural gas, and from oil to natural gas, can reduce
emissions. Natural gas has the lowest CO, emis-
sions per unit of energy of all fossil fuels at about
14 kg C/GJ, compared to oil with about 20 kg
C/GJ, and coal with about 25 kg C/GJ. The lower

"Deep reductions of CO, emissions from energy sup-
ply systems are technically possible within 50 to 100
years, using alternative strategies.

Many combinations of the options identified in this
assessment could reduce global CO, emissions from
fossil fuels from about 6 Gt C in 1990 to about 4 Gt C
per year by 2050, and to about 2 Gt C per year by
2100 (see Figure 17). Cumulative CO, emissions,
from 1990 to 2100, would range from about 450 to
about 470 Gt C in the alternative LESS constructions.
Higher energy efficiency is underscored for achieving
deep reductions in CO, emissions, for increasing the
flexibility of supply-side combinations, and for reduc-

in industrialized and developing countries, respectively) and
25-fold by 2100 (13-fold and 70-fold in industrialized and

of emphasis on energy efficiency, primary energy consumption
rises much more slowly than GDP. The energy supply con-

ably in some areas. Natural gas could potentially
replace oil in the transportation sector.
Approaches exist to reduce emissions of CH,
from natural gas pipelines and emissions of CH,
and/or CO, from oil and gas wells and coal mines.
Decarbonization of flue gases and fuels and CO,
storage. The removal and storage of CO, from
fossil fuel power-station stack gases is feasible,
but reduces the conversion efficiency and signif-
icantly increases the production cost of electrici-
ty. Another approach to decarbonization uses fos-
sil fuel feedstocks to make hydrogen-rich fuels.
Both approaches generate a byproduct stream of
CO, that could be stored, for example, in deplet-
ed natural gas fields. The future availability of
conversion technologies such as fuel cells that
can efficiently use hydrogen would increase the
relative attractiveness of the latter approach. For
some longer term CO, storage options, cost, envi-
ronmental effects, and efficacy remain largely
unknown.

¢ Switching to non-fossil fuel sources of energy

Switching to nuclear energy. Nuclear energy
could replace baseload fossil fuel electricity gen-
eration in many parts of the world if generally
acceptable responses can be found to concerns
such as reactor safety, radioactive-waste transport
and disposal, and nuclear proliferation.
Switching to renewable sources of energy. Solar,
biomass, wind, hydro, and geothermal technologies
already are widely used. In 1990, renewable
sources of energy contributed about 20% of the
world’s primary energy consumption, most of it
fuelwood and hydropower. Technological
advances offer new opportunities and declining
costs for energy from these sources. In the longer
term, renewable sources of energy could meet a
major part of the world’s demand for energy. Power
systems can easily accommodate limited fractions
of intermittent generation and, with the addition of
fast-responding backup and storage units, also
higher fractions. Where biomass is sustainably
tegrown and used to displace fossil fuels in energy
production, net carbon emissions are avoided as the
CO, released in converting the biomass to energy is
again fixed in biomass through photosynthesis. If
the development of biomass energy can be carried
out in ways that effectively address concerns about
other environmental issues and competition with
other land uses, biomass could make major contri-
butions in both the electricity and fuels markets, as
well as offering prospects of increased rural
employment and income.

to promote this carbon storage. Biomass for the production of
electricity or liquid fuels, continuously harvested and regrown
in a sustainable manner, would avoid the release of fossil car-
bon. In the long run, this would offer a more efficient strategy
than one based on carbon storage in vegetation and soils, which
would saturate with time. The development of this mitigation
option will depend critically upon the competitiveness of bio-
mass. However, managing forests to conserve and increase car-
bon storage offers an effective mitigation option during the
transition period of many decades necessary to stabilize atmos-

"Mitigation depends on reducing barriers to the diffusion and
transfer of technology, mobilizing financial resources, support-
ing capacity building in developing countries, and other
approaches to assist in the implementation of behavioral
changes and technological opportunities in all regions of the
globe. The optimum mix of policies will vary from country to
country, depending upon political structure and societal recep-
tiveness. The leadership of national governments in applying
these policies will contribute to responding to adverse conse-
quences of climate change. Governments can choose policies
that facilitate the penetration of less greenhouse gas-intensive
technologies and modified consumption patterns. Indeed,
many countries have extensive experience with a variety of
policies that can accelerate the adoption of such technologies.

"Estimates of the full costs of conserving or sequestering carbon
in forests should include land values as well as capital, infra-
structure, and other costs. However, many of these costs are
particularly difficult to generalize given the amenity value of
forests, their importance in traditional economies, and their
significance in maintaining regional environments and biodi-
versity. Costs for conserving and sequestering carbon in bio-
mass and soil are estimated to range widely, but can be com-
petitive with other mitigation options. Factors affecting costs
include opportunity costs of land, initial costs of planting and
establisment, costs of nurseries, the cost of annual maintenance
and monitoring, and transaction costs. Direct and indirect ben-
efits will vary with national circumstances and could offset the
costs. Additional amounts of carbon could be sequestered in
agricultural and rangeland soils over a 50-year period by
improved management practices, although less is currently
known about the global potential in this sector.

"In the forestry sector, assuming the present climate and no
change in the estimated area of available lands, the cumulative
amount of carbon that could feasibly be conserved and
sequestered through establishment of plantations and agro-
forestry, forest regeneration, sustaining existing forest cover,
and slowing deforestation over the period 1995-2050 ranges
between 60 and 90 Gt C. The literature indicates that the trop-
ics have the potential to conserve and sequester the largest
quantity of carbon (80% of the global total in the forestry sec-
tor), with more than half due to promoting forest regeneration
and slowing deforestation. Tropical America has the largest
potential for carbon conservation and sequestration (46% of
tropical total), followed by tropical Asia (34%) and tropical
Africa (20%). The temperate and boreal zones could sequester
about 20% of the global total, mainly in the United States, tem-
perate Asia, the former Soviet Union, China, and New Zealand.
Altering the climate and land-use assumptions—for example,
by increasing demand for agricultural land in the tropics or
accounting for potential consequences of climate change—
would reduce these estimates significantly.

"Competing uses of land, water, and other natural
resources. A growing population and expanding econ-
omy will increase the demand for land and other nat-
ural resources needed to provide, inter alia, food,
fiber, forest products, and recreation services. Climate
change will interact with the resulting intensified pat-
terns of resource use. Land and other resources could
also be required for mitigation of greenhouse gas
emissions. Agricultural productivity improvements
throughout the world and especially in developing
countries would increase availability of land for pro-
duction of biomass energy.

Geoengineering options. Some geoengineering
approaches to counterbalance greenhouse-induced cli-
mate change have been suggested (e.g., putting solar
radiation reflectors in space, or injecting sulfate
aerosols into the atmosphere to mimic the cooling
influence of volcanic eruptions). Such approaches
generally are likely to be ineffective, expensive to sus-
tain, and/or to have serious environmental and other
effects which are in many cases poorly understood.

"Plants also need inorganic nutrients from the soil, such as

"At any site, there are usually many different plant species that
interact with each other and with other organisms in a multi-
tude of different ways. In considering the effect of climate
change on any terrestrial ecosystem, it is necessary to consider
not only the direct ecophysiological effects in response to cli-
mate change but also the ways in which these direct effects are
modified by soil feedbacks and biological interactions between
different organisms.

"Solar radiation, temperature, precipitation, air humidity, and
atmospheric CO, concentration are some of the most important
external forces that drive ecosystem processes. Precipitation, air
humidity, and other meteorological variables—as well as plant
and soil variables—together determine water availability for
plants, Of these, changes in temperature, water availability, and
CO, concentration are likely to constitute the most significant
changes for terrestrial ecosystems over the coming century. The
effects of these changes are discussed in the following sections.

"Extreme temperatures are often more important than average
temperatures in determining plant responses (Woodward,
1987). If global warming reduces the frequency of extremely
low temperatures, plants may be able to survive at higher lati-
tudes or altitudes, and agricultural plants can be grown for
longer periods of the year without the danger of damaging
frosts. On the other hand, many plants are adapted to the cli-
mate in their current locations, and a general warming could
result in premature bud-burst and so, paradoxically, increase
frost damage (Hanninen, 1991). Alternatively, plants may
experience insufficient chilling exposure so that flowering and

"All living organisms in terrestrial ecosystems ultimately depend
directly or indirectly upon photosynthesis for their energy
requirements. Photosynthesis depends on the absorption of light
and the diffusion of CO, from the atmosphere to the sites of
photosynthesis within leaves. To take up CO,, plants must open
their stomata; this generally results in considerable water loss.
Increases in atmospheric CO, concentration can reduce water
loss and increase photosynthetic carbon gain of most plants.
Plant growth is only possible if temperatures are between some
lower and upper thresholds; plant growth at most locations is
likely to increase with moderate increases in annual mean tem-
perature, mainly due to lengthening of the growing season.
"	Text
"The increase in CO, and other greenhouse gases is expected to
cause an increase in global mean temperature, with larger
increases at high latitudes than elsewhere and larger increases
during winter than summer (Gates et al., 1992; Greco et al.,
1994). Plant growth and health may benefit from increased tem-
peratures because of reduced freezing and chilling damage, but
plants may be harmed by increased high-temperature damage.
There is some indication that higher mean temperatures in the
future will be associated with more variable and more extreme
temperatures (Katz and Brown, 1992). However, the increase in
global mean temperature during the past half-century has been
primarily a result of higher night temperature (Karl et al., 1993).

"Net primary productivity (NPP) is generally enhanced by mod-
est increases in temperature, especially in temperate and bore-
al regions (e.g., Kauppi and Posch, 1985; Cannell et al., 1989;
Kokorin et al., 1993; Beuker, 1994). According to a relation-
ship developed by Lieth (1973) based on observed net primary
production in a variety of ecosystems, NPP will increase from
1% per °C increase in temperature in ecosystems with a mean
annual temperature of 30°C to 10% per °C at 0°C. However,
because this relationship is based on observations of NPP
under present temperatures, part of the apparent increase could
be the result of a correlation between higher solar radiation and
higher temperature, so the actual effects of temperature change
alone may be smaller.

"Because many of the responses of terrestrial plants in diverse
ecosystems are similar, a general description is offered here of
some of the major potential impacts of climate change on terrestri-
al ecosystems (see also Chapter 9, Terrestrial Biotic Responses to
Environmental Change and Feedbacks to Climate, of the IPCC
Working Group I volume), This primer initially provides some
overview of effects of the most important climatic driving forces
that are likely to change, then discusses effects on soil carbon and
nitrogen dynamics, looks at soil fertility as a modifying effect on
responses to external driving forces, and includes a brief discussion
of soil biological factors. These broad ecosystem responses are
modified by ecological interactions between the different organ-
isms in each ecosystem; the primer provides a brief overview of the
major ecological factors that must be considered in assessing the
impact of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems.

"Effects of increasing temperature on crop yields are more dif-
ficult to predict than effects of temperature on NPP because
crop yields are not only affected by NPP but also by the phe-
nology of crop development (see also Chapter 13). Increased
temperature can speed phenological development, reducing the
grain-filling period for crops and lowering yield—as is
observed in current conditions (e.g., Monteith, 1981) and in
most modeling studies (Warrick et al., 1986; Chapter 13). For
example, Wang et al. (1992) modeled the growth of wheat with
climate change, and found that yield decreased as temperature
increased because crop development was hastened. A cultivar
from a warmer region, however, responded positively to mod-
erate increases in temperature and gave a larger yield than the
cultivar from the colder region under current conditions. This
suggests that current cultivars might generally perform more
poorly in a warmer climate, but losses could generally be
avoided by cultivar substitution.

conductance (Kimball and Idso, 1983; Morison, 1987) and
higher leaf photosynthetic rates (Eamus and Jarvis, 1989; Arp,
1991). This improves water-use efficiency, so carbon gain for
plants with limited water supply should increase with increas-
ing CO, concentration (Rogers et al., 1983; Idso and Brazel,
1984; Tolley and Strain, 1985; Morison, 1987; Eamus and

"Many ecosystems experience shortage of soil water (drought)
during some or most of the year, which limits their potential
carbon gain (Lieth, 1973; Hinckley et al., 1981, Woodward,
1987). Soil water availability can be related to the ratio of pre-
cipitation to potential evapotranspiration, or to other measures
of water availability, such as the ratio of actual to potential
evapotranspiration. What is important in all these measures is
that soil water availability can be affected by changes in either
gains (precipitation) or losses (evapotranspiration) of water.

"Active physiological processes of plants require an aqueous
medium. Higher land plants are able to survive within a gener-
ally dry atmosphere because they are covered by a cuticular
epidermis that minimizes water loss. For growth, however,
plant leaves must take up CO, from the atmosphere. This need
for a path for diffusion of CO, into the leaves also provides a
path by which water is lost from leaves. Water loss is regulat-
ed by stomata whose aperture is adjusted in response to envi-
ronmental variables and internal regulators.

"Different plant types (see Box A-1) have different water-use
efficiencies. C, plants have relatively poor water use efficiency.
C, plants have higher water-use efficiency because they photo-
synthesize at lower internal CO, concentration and thereby
increase the difference in CO, concentrations between the
atmosphere and the sites of photosynthesis. In CAM plants,
CO, uptake occurs at night, when leaves are coolest and the leaf
to air water vapor concentration difference is smallest. This
gives CAM plants the highest water-use efficiency of all plants.
"	Text
"Total plant growth under water-limited conditions is essential-
ly given by the product of the amount of water used and
water-use efficiency. Short-term water-use efficiency can be
expressed as the ratio of the difference of CO, concentration
between the atmosphere and the sites of photosynthesis to the
difference of water-vapor concentration between the sites of
evaporation within leaves and the atmosphere. Hence, anything
that changes either of these concentration differences can
potentially affect water-use efficiency and thus growth under
water-limited conditions (Eamus, 1991).

"and if soil water is not replenished by rain or irrigation, then
the water content of plants must eventually fall and their phys-
iological function is impaired (Hsiao, 1973; Bradford and
Hsiao, 1982). Water-stressed plants restrict further water loss-
es by closing stomata, by adjusting the angle at which leaves
are held to minimize light absorption, or by shedding leaves
(Passioura, 1982). CO, uptake and growth is then reduced or
completely prevented (Schulze and Hall, 1982). Water avail-
ability at most locations is seasonally variable, with plants
experiencing at least temporary drought for some time
(Woodward, 1987; Stevenson, 1990). Individual species are
adapted to particular water regimes and may perform poorly
and possibly die in conditions to which they are poorly adapt-
ed (e.g., Hinckley et al., 1981).

"Increased episodes of extremely high temperature can damage
plants, especially in conjunction with water shortage.
However, if sufficient soil water is available, leaf temperatures
can be substantially lower than air temperature as a result of
evaporative cooling. Burke et al. (1988) report that many
plants maintain leaf temperatures within a preferred range,
thereby optimizing NPP. While the amount of water consumed
for leaf cooling can be substantial and highly variable, typical-
ly 200-500 water molecules may be lost for each molecule of
CO, taken up (Sharkey, 1985). This can lead to insufficient
water in plant tissues, resulting in reduced growth. Elevated

CO, reduces stomatal conductance (Eamus, 1991) and so saves
water, but this may further increase the temperature of leaves,
over and above increased air temperature.

"Plant membranes may be damaged at high temperature (Berry
and Bjorkman, 1980), and membranes in plants are often mod-
ified following growth in high temperature. However, this
reduces plant performance at low temperature. High tempera-
ture can affect other plant processes. Respiration rates are often
increased by high temperatures, and plant respiration can
account for the loss of a significant fraction of the carbon fixed
in photosynthesis. However, plants may acclimate to higher
temperature, and the short-term effects of temperature on respi-
ration are often not seen when plants are grown at different tem-
peratures (e.g., Gifford, 1994; Kémer, 1995), Also, the response
of leaf respiration rate to temperature can be substantially
reduced in plants grown in high CO, and high temperature (e.g.,
Wullschleger and Norby, 1992). The interaction between
increased temperature and increased CO, is substantial, and the
effect of warming by itself may be modified or even reversed
when CO, effects are considered. Other processes—such as the
volatilization of hydrocarbons, which could affect carbon bal-
ance—show less acclimation to high temperature (Tingey et al.,
1991; Lerdau 1991). Hydrocarbon loss from leaves can exceed
10% of the carbon taken up for photosynthesis.

water-vapor concentration differences will increase by about
5-6% per °C warming. However, if nighttime temperatures

the case over recent decades (Karl et al., 1993)—then the con-

"Where climate change leads to annual or seasonal changes in
water availability, agricultural and forest productivity could
change. Significant reductions in soil water availability could
lead to forest decline. There could also be indirect problems,
such as more floods and greater erosion hazards caused by
more intense rainfall. Wind erosion could increase if drought
lengthens the time that the ground is bare of vegetation.
Changes in the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspi-
ration could also affect water discharge into rivers and ground-
water reservoirs.

"C,— Cy, plants have a special CO,-concentrating mechanism within their leaves by which they can increase the CO, con-

This allows these plants to maintain lower intercellular CO, concentrations than C; plants. C, plants tend to grow in
warmer, more water-limited regions, and include many tropical grasses and the agriculturally important species maize, sug-

Le Houerou et al., 1993). Based on the Thornthwaite method,
these workers conclude that water may become more limiting

"If water runs off the surface instead of infiltrating the soil, the
amount available to plants is reduced; this may also lead to ero-

structure, slope, vegetation cover, soil surface roughness, sur-
face crusting, and land management. Infiltration is also con-
trolled by soil water content because saturated soils are unable
to absorb water and very dry soils can be slow to re-wet.
Aggregated soils with good structure facilitate infiltration, and
aggregation is strongly affected by the organic matter content
of the topsoil. Surface runoff is also strongly dependent on the
amount and intensity of rainfall, which in most regions is like-

"General circulation models (GCMs) suggest that there are like-

the global average and where the additional rainfall may be
more than sufficient to meet increased evaporative demand,
whereas other regions may receive less rainfall than at present
(Mitchell et al., 1990; Greco et al., 1994); this is further com-
plicated by feedbacks from the biosphere. Henderson-Sellers er
al. (1995), for example, show that inclusion of stomatal closure
in response to increasing CO, concentration led to a reduction
in the predicted increase in precipitation from 7.7% for dou-
bled CO, to only 5.0%. The timing of water availability with-
in ecosystems may also change. For example, earlier melting
of snowpacks may mean that less water is available during
summer (Mitchell e¢ al., 1990; Hayes, 1991). There will there-

proportional increase in aboveground growth is less than the
increase in photosynthesis or total growth. Responses may also

growth of C, plants (Poorter, 1993), and increased tree seedling

be confounded by many factors. Firstly, acclimation of photo-

diminished. An average 21% decrease in photosynthetic capac-

Wullschleger, 1994), although this may be an artifact of pot

Despite this decline in capacity, photosynthetic rate per unit
leaf area was on average 44% higher in elevated than in ambi-

rooting volumes, they are most likely a consequence of nitro-

"It is well-established that short-term photosynthetic rates in C,
plants increase by 25-75% for a doubling of CO, concentration

some workers have found little response (e.g., Morison and
Gifford, 1983; Henderson ef al., 1992), others have found
increases of 10-25% in photosynthetic rate for a doubling of
CO, concentration (e.g., Wong, 1979; Pearcy et al., 1982;
Polley et ai., 1992). The sensitivity of C,; photosynthesis to
CO, concentration increases with increasing temperature
(Long, 1991; Bowes, 1993; Kirschbaum, 1994); hence, the
stimulation of plant growth by increasing CO, concentration is
likely to be larger at higher temperatures (Idso et al., 1987;
Rawson, 1992), with little stimulation and sometimes even

"Because the atmospheric CO, concentration has already
increased from a preindustrial concentration of about 280
ppmv to about 360 ppmv at present, there should be evidence
of increased growth of plants under natural conditions.
However, the evidence from tree-ring chronologies is unclear
(Innes, 1991). For example, Graumlich (1991) found no
growth enhancements at five subalpine sites in the Sierra
Nevada (California), but LaMarche et al. (1984), Kienast and
Luxmoore (1988), Hari and Arovaara (1988), Cook et al.

observed varying degrees of growth enhancement in recent
times compared with preindustrial times. However, part or all
of that increase can probably be explained by more favorable
temperatures and nitrogen fertilization by moderate levels of
industrial pollution, especially as some of the observed
increases are far greater than would be expected from CO,
enrichment alone (Luxmoore et al., 1993).

"Atmospheric CO, is a basic substrate for photosynthesis,
which underlies plant growth. In the response of plants to CO,
concentration, it is important to distinguish between plants
with the C, and C, photosynthetic pathways. Increasing CO,
concentration directly affects photosynthesis in three ways.
Firstly, the carboxylating enzyme for carbon reduction in all
plants, Rubisco, has a poor affinity for CO,. The present
atmosphere results in CO, concentrations in chloroplasts that
are well below half-saturation (Farquhar and von Caemmerer,
1982). Consequently, the photosynthetic rate is very responsive
to small increases in CO, concentration in C; plants. Secondly,
oxygen competes with CO, for the active site on Rubisco, lead-
ing to photorespiration (Farquhar and von Caemmerer, 1982).
The rise in atmospheric CO, concentration will progressively
reduce photorespiration and enhance quantum yield of carbon
fixation in C; plants. This will not occur in C, plants, which
have a CO,-concentrating mechanism that already suppresses
photorespiration. Thirdly, stomata in many species progres-
sively close as the atmospheric CO, concentration increases,
thus reducing water loss relative to carbon gain. This gain may
be offset to some extent by increased leaf temperature. It has
also been argued that CO, will alter respiratory activity.
Experimental evidence demonstrates both increases and
decreases in response to increasing atmospheric CO, concen-
tration (e.g., Amthor, 1991; Poorter et al., 1992).

could significantly affect rates of diffusion and thus the supply
of mineral nutrients such as P and K to plants. This could well
alter the species composition of plants in natural systems and

by the balance between carbon inputs and carbon losses by
organic-matter decomposition (soil respiration) rates. All ter-
restrial carbon inputs originate from plant products reaching
the soil either as root exudates, dead roots, leaf litter, dead
branches, or trees or indirectly as feces or bodies of animals.
The annual input of carbon is thereby given by the amount of
annual NPP minus the fractions of carbon that are removed

fires, respired by herbivores, or stored in increasing wood vol-

plant-growth responses to doubled CO, concentration do not

On the other hand, if increasing CO, concentration can stimu-

consequently soil organic-matter content are possible. Limited
experimental evidence suggests that nitrogen fixation may be
enhanced by increasing CO, concentration (e.g., Norby, 1987;

likely to be enhanced by increasing temperature, as all micro-

responsible for N-emissions from soils (Armstrong Brown et

moisture content, and aeration status, and agricultural manage-

saturated (anaerobic) soil or, at least, saturated microsites.
Denitrification rates consequently increase with increasing soil
water content. Soils are also likely to be a small sink for NO,

precipitation, soil conditions, and so forth. Each of these vari-
ables can be thought of as describing an axis in a multidimen-
sional space, and the area or volume that describes the pre-
ferred habitat of a species is its niche (e.g., Austin et al., 1990,
Begon et al., 1990). A species’ “fundamental niche” encom-
passes all the environmental conditions in which it could
potentially grow and reproduce if it were subject to no compe-
tition or other effects from other species (e.g., herbivory, dis-
ease). The fundamental niche is a consequence of an organ-
ism’s basic physiological tolerances and ecological traits. In
most ecosystems, where organisms compete and interact with
others, a species occupies a smaller space, called its “realized
niche” (Hutchinson, 1957). :

and their pollinating insects) are subject to the same constraints in
relation to niche as other species. Climate change may advantage
or disadvantage these species, with significant consequences for
their host species. Schemes that help in the assessment of the like-
ly effects of climate change on host-pest interactions are being
developed (Landsberg and Stafford Smith, 1992).

"Several aspects of herbivory might be affected by climate
change. Some insect herbivores require cold periods during
their life cycle, and these might be affected by warming.
Higher rates of carbon fixation (see Section A.2.3) may pro-
vide more food for herbivores, but the quality of the food will
be affected. It is likely that increased atmospheric CO, con-
centration will lead plants to produce tissue with a higher ratio
of carbon to nitrogen (C:N) than under current conditions
(Bazzaz, 1990; Field et al., 1992). Many herbivores, especial-
ly insects, are limited by not being able to gather enough

"Many insect herbivores have a boom-bust population cycle.
They build up through several generations, with each genera-
tion larger, depleting their plant resources until the population is
checked by lack of food, the onset of unsuitable weather (e.g.,
winter or drought), or natural enemies. If conditions after cli-
mate change allow the herbivore population to build up faster,
much higher population levels and much greater damage may
occur before they are checked. Conversely, some insect herbi-
vores may be disadvantaged by climate change if, for example,
the new conditions are more favorable to their enemies or the
timing of growth or flowering of their food plants change. There
is some evidence that stressful periods such as droughts that
lead to reduced photosynthesis also lead to reduced production
of compounds that normally help to control insect populations.
Thus, some have predicted that under changed climatic condi-
tions, stress periods will be more common and insect outbreaks
more frequent (Mattson and Haack, 1987).

"nitrogen in their diet (Scriber and Slansky, 1981), and a higher
CN ratio will force them to consume more carbon in order to
gain a given amount of nitrogen. Some herbivores will increase
the amount of tissue they consume to maintain their nitrogen
uptake. In this case, damage by herbivores to their plant hosts is
likely to increase. In other cases, herbivores will not be able to
consume and digest enough plant tissue to maintain their required
nitrogen intake. Their nutrition will suffer, and their population
numbers will fall; they may even die out (Watt et al., 1995). Some
plants may also produce more defensive compounds, such as tan-
nins and phenolics, when grown in elevated CO, (e.g., Lavola
and Julkunen-Tiitto, 1994). Thus, in those cases, damage by her-
bivores will decrease in response to increased C:N ratios.
Changes in the amount of herbivory will affect the nutrient cycle
because nitrogen is cycled more rapidly but is also more likely to
be lost to the atmosphere through volatilization when it passes
through the guts of herbivores than through litter-decomposing
organisms (Chapin and McNaughton, 1989).

"Individual organisms compete with each other for essential
resources such as light, nutrients, and food, and for specific
needs such as nesting space. Climate change may alter the com-
petitive balance between species at a site by differentially
affecting their effectiveness in the capture of resources or their
efficiency in using them. Climate change may also result in the
addition or loss of species from the site, thus changing the out-
come of future competitive interactions. Higher CO, concentra-
tions are predicted to favor C; species over C, species. Limited
experimental results have shown that, although high CO, tends
to favor C, over C, species, there is a wide range of responses
and competitive outcomes even among C; species (Bazzaz,
1990). The fertilizing effect of widespread nitrogen deposition
from industrial areas is a useful analogy for the impacts of cli-
mate change on the competitive interactions between species. In
areas affected by heavy deposition, rapidly growing species of
grasses and forbs are favored over slower growing, nitrogen-
efficient shrubs (Chapin, 1980; Field et al., 1992).

"Climate change may cause the distribution of suitable habitats
on a map to change. If temperature, moisture, or other climate
variables at a particular location change, individuals at that
location may find themselves now to be outside their funda-
mental niche. If a particular location falls outside the funda-
mental niche of a species, it is certain that individuals of this
species will not be able to continue to reproduce and persist at
this site. In other cases, the location may still fall within the
fundamental niche but outside the realized niche. In this case,
it is difficult to predict whether the species will be able to per-
sist at this location because that will depend on which other
species are able to persist or invade that site. In other cases, the
location may still fall within the realized niche, and it is likely
that the species will be able to continue to live at this site—
although it may still be affected by changes in the distribution
of other species. These assumptions are the basis of a number
of models that attempt to predict the redistribution of organ-
isms across the globe as a consequence of climate change
(Box, 1981; Emanuel et al., 1985; Prentice et al., 1992, Cramer
and Leemans, 1993).

"These views about communities represent the end points of a
continuum of ideas. Current thinking favors the view that com-
munities are a collection of individual species, but an important
ecological research theme is to identify rules that govern com-
munity structure (Drake, 1990; Keddy, 1992) and to seek
groups of species that are ecological equivalents (sometimes
called functional types; Smith et al., 1993).
"	Text
"The view of communities affects the methods used for predic-
tions of ecological changes in response to global change. If
communities change more like “organisms,” it would be likely
that under climate change one community will be replaced by
another already known from elsewhere. This allows simple
modeling by matching communities to environmental condi-
tions and assuming that they will redistribute themselves with
climate change (see the discussion of Holdridge, etc., in
Section A.4.4,2).
"	Text
"The loss of individuals from a community creates opportunities
for others to invade. However, species best adapted to new
conditions will not necessarily be among the early invaders
because they may lack the dispersal ability to reach the site.
The ability of species to invade new suitable locations varies
greatly. Thus, it is unlikely that communities will move en
masse. What is more likely is a sequence of invasions and loss-
es leading to completely new communities, as was apparently
the case over the past 10,000 years following the last Ice Age
(e.g., Davis et al., 1986; Webb and Bartlein, 1992).
"	Text
"However, with a changed climate and disturbance regimes at a
given location, conditions for some individuals will remain
within their niche space, and they will continue to survive and
reproduce at that location. Some species will be lost from the
community relatively quickly as existing individuals die under
the changed conditions (e.g., extreme temperatures, droughts,
waterlogging) or disturbances (e.g., fires). Individuals of other
species will be able to survive but not reproduce, and—
although some individuals of long-lived species may persist at
the site for decades or centuries—the species will eventually be
lost from that location.
"	Text
"There has long been a debate about the nature of communities
and the degree to which they could be described as discrete
entities. Communities were once compared with living organ-
isms and described as tightly integrated assemblages of inter-
acting species. Thus, a community was seen as an entity in its
own right. If a community was perturbed by the loss or addi-
tion of some species, it would tend to recover to its previous
composition or change to another discretely recognizable
assemblage. The alternative view is that communities are
essentially a collection of species, with each species behaving
and interacting according to its own physiological and ecolog-
ical potential. In this view, a community is a more fortuitous
collection of species. Species continually invade or are lost
from the community as populations fluctuate in response to
weather, disturbances, and competitors.
"	Text
"Communities are always changing, both as a result of a chang-
ing balance of interactions between the component species and
in responses to disturbances. However, there are some patterns
in the way communities respond to disturbances and change
over time (i.e,, succession). Succession was originally
described as a sequence of organism-like communities, with
one replacing another according to more-or-less strict rules
(Clements, 1936). The endpoint of this succession of commu-
nities was called the climax community—determined, it was
argued, by long-term climatic and soil conditions. Now suc-
cession is more often described as the outcome of a series of
species losses and invasions as disturbances occur and condi-
tions change (Whittaker, 1975). More emphasis is now placed
on the stochastic nature of vegetation change, especially in
ecosystems where disturbances such as fire or intense winds
are common (Noble and Slatyer, 1980; Shugart, 1984).

"Most plant species have poor dispersal ability, with the vast
majority of seeds falling close to the parent plant. These
species migrate very slowly—in most cases, far slower than
anticipated shifts in climate zones—and they depend mainly on
rare long-distance dispersal events to spread or invade new
habitats. The rate at which many species spread after past dis-
turbances, such as the ice ages, can be estimated by mapping
the distribution of pollen left behind in bogs, lake sediments,
and so forth (e.g., Davis et al., 1986). Most species migration
rates, estimated to be 10-30 km per century, are at least an
order of magnitude less than the anticipated rates of shift in cli-
mate zones of 100 to 600 km over the next century (e.g.,
Solomon and Cramer, 1993). However, past migration rates are
only a poor guide to the future because past rates may have
been limited by the rate at which the climate changed. Also, the
future potential for species migration is different than it was in
the past. On the one hand, landscapes are now much more dis-
sected by human activities than in the past, and this will hinder
natural migration rates (di Castri and Hansen, 1992). On the
other hand, human activities and technologies, such as motor
vehicles and aircraft, provide sources of long-distance disper-
sal that were not present in the past.

"In addition, there might be rapid breakdown of the existing
community structure via the loss of some species and invasion
by others. The invading species will tend to be those best

species. They might be expected to do well during any reorga-
nization of communities.

"More complex ecosystem responses may also occur. Initially
increased growth may lead to reduced palatability of plant
tissue for insect herbivores, which may either reduce or
increase insect damage (see Section A.4.2.2) and thereby

either act as positive or negative feedback on the initial
response.
"	Text
"There has been progress in modeling the equilibrium distribu-
tions of biomes, which implicitly assumes that communities
have time to sort themselves out. But the process of migration
and reassembly may well lag behind the rate of climate change.
Thus, climate-change studies based on the use of these equi-
librium models can provide only a first indication of the direc-
tion or magnitude of expected changes.
"	Text
"Conversely, biological nitrogen fixation may be stimulated by
more favorable growing conditions and lessen nutrient limita-
tions. In systems that are not strongly nutrient limited, initial
growth responses may allow greater leaf-area development,
which allows greater light interception and further increases
growth responses beyond that predicted from leaf-level
responses.

"A community and its abiotic environment is called an ecosys-
tem. The abiotic and biotic components of an ecosystem inter-
act, including significant effects of the biotic on the abiotic. For
example, plant and animal communities often modify the soils.
This process takes many decades or much longer but can even-
tually result in soils with properties that are closely matched
with the communities they support. Where climate change
causes significant spatial shifts of the range of species, these
relationships may not be retained.
"	Text
"As an example, Figure A-1 shows where some of the world’s
major biomes are found in relation to temperature and rainfall.
In looking at the distribution of any biome in relation to cli-
mate, it must be recognized that annual mean values of tem-
perature and precipitation provide only a rough guide to the
requirements or tolerances of vegetation classes. In many
instances, the distribution of classes also depends on seasonal
factors, such as the length of a dry season or the lowest
absolute minimum temperature, and on soil factors, such as
water-holding capacity.
"	Text
"Ecosystem-level feedbacks may either dampen or amplify
the growth response to individual climatic variables (Field et
al., 1992). The response of the ecosystem may depend on
how the complex chain of interactions affects the cycling of
nutrients and the efficient use of light and water. For exam-
ple, if the availability of any one resource, such as carbon,
increases, then other resources, such as nutrients, become
relatively more limiting. Plants may respond to this by
increased root growth, and this allocation shift may reduce
the growth response of aboveground biomass to increasing
CO, concentration.
"	Text
"Furthermore, if growth is determined more by the rate at which
nutrients rather than carbon can be obtained, then even total
plant production may not be increased. These constraints might
eventually restrict the growth response of whole ecosystems to
less than might be expected from short-term experiments on
single plants or small communities (KSrner, 1993), The overall
functioning of the ecosystem may sometimes be insensitive to
changes in particular species composition. One or more species
may be replaced by others with more appropriate temperature
optima or responses to CO,, but the system as a whole may
continue to function with broadly the same structure, physiog-
nomy, and physiology.

"A classification of biomes commonly used in global-change
research was developed by Holdridge (1947). He used annual
biotemperature (a measure related to the sum of temperatures
above freezing throughout the year) and total precipitation to
classify the vegetation of the world into 14 life zones or bio-
mes. His scheme has been used as the basis for some predic-
tions of the global-scale impacts of changed climates (e.g.,
Emanuel et al., 1985), although more complex schemes have
also been developed based on a wider range of climatic and
soil parameters and a wider range of assumptions about the
important variables delimiting the vegetation zones of the
world (Box, 1981; Prentice et al., 1992; Woodward, 1993;
Neilson et al., 1992).

"Most observers readily recognize the similarity of ecosystems
in the deserts of the world, no matter where they occur and how
far apart they are. There are subtle differences between desert
communities, such as the presence of cacti in some deserts and
not in others and the diversity of reptiles between different
deserts. However, all desert ecosystems operate within similar
constraints, and their biota show similar adaptations to deal
with these constraints. These similar ecosystems have been
described with many different terms (e.g., biomes, life zones,
biogeoclimatic zones) and emphases. Many studies relating to
the global distribution of biomes and their redistribution under
climate change define from 10 to 40 or more classes.
Originally, their descriptions were based on the structure and
appearance of the vegetation (Walter, 1962), but more recently
climatic information has been used (e.g., Box, 1981; Cramer
and Leemans, 1993).

best adapted to the most efficient use of resources in the pre-

less efficient use of light and water and less efficient recycling

of carbon is likely to result from such a breakdown.
Considerable scientific uncertainty remains about the length of

"Primary energy is the energy that is embodied in resources as
they exist in nature: the chemical energy embodied in fossil
fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) or biomass, the potential ener-
gy of a water reservoir, the electromagnetic energy of solar
radiation, and the energy released in nuclear reactions. For the
most part, primary energy is not used directly but is first con-
verted and transformed into electricity and fuels such as gaso-
line, jet fuel, heating oil, or charcoal.
"	Text
"Final energy is the energy transported and distributed to the
point of final use. Examples include gasoline at the service sta-
tion, electricity at the socket, or fuelwood in the barn. The next
energy transformation is the conversion of final energy in end-
use devices, such as appliances, machines, and vehicles, into
useful energy, such as work and heat. Useful energy is mea-
sured at the crankshaft of an automobile engine or an industri-
al electric motor, by the heat of a household radiator or an
industrial boiler, or by the luminosity of a light bulb. The appli-
cation of useful energy provides energy services, such as a
moving vehicle, a warm room, process heat, or light.

"More than half of the anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions originate from the energy system (both in terms of
mass and in terms of radiative forcing). The predominant gas is
CO,, which represents more than half of the increase in radia-
tive forcing from anthropogenic GHG sources. The majority of
this CO, arises from the use of fossil fuels, which in turn make
up about 75% of the total energy use. The global energy con-
sumption of 385 EJ in 1990 was small compared with the solar
radiation of about 5.4 million EJ intercepted annually by Earth.
Although small in relation to natural energy flows, the emis-
sions of energy-related GHGs create a danger of anthropogenic
interference with Earth’s radiative balance (energy budget).

"Energy services are the result of a combination of various tech-
nologies, infrastructures (capital), labor (know-how), materi-
als, and energy carriers. Clearly, all these input factors carry a
price tag and, within each category, are in part substitutable for
one another. From the consumer’s perspective, the important
issues are the quality and cost of energy services. It often mat-
ters little what the energy carrier or the source of that carrier is.
It is fair to say that most consumers are often unaware of the
“upstream” activities of the energy system. The energy system
is service-driven (i.e., from the bottom up), whereas energy
flows are driven by resource availability and conversion
processes (from the top down). Energy flows and driving
forces interact intimately. Therefore, the energy sector should
never be analyzed in isolation: It is not sufficient to consider
only how energy is supplied; the analysis also must include
how and for what purposes energy is used.

"The carbon content of fossil energy in 1990 was about 6 (+0.5)
Gt C [(billion tons) or Pg C (10!5 grams) elemental carbon], of
which about 2.3 Gt C were emitted by the energy sector during
conversion to fuels and electricity and distribution to final use.
The remainder, about 3.7 Gt C, was emitted at the point of end-
use. Included are 0.3 Gt C that were extracted from fossil sources
without contributing directly to net carbon emissions. This car-
bon was embodied in durable hydrocarbon-based materials such
as plastics, asphalt, lubricants, and pharmaceuticals. The carbon
flows in Figure B-2 are simplifications because the carbon in fos-
sil fuels is not completely oxidized to CO, during combustion.
Eventually, however, most hydrocarbons and other combustion
products containing carbon are converted to CO,. There is some
ambiguity concerning the amount of CO, emissions from feed-
stocks embodied in chemical products, as well as the unsustain-
able use of biomass. Carbon is released by the burning of biomass,

The extent of annual net emissions from nonfossil CO, is difficult
to determine due to forest regrowth and the fact that the majority
of biomass use is renewable. For simplification, we assume that
feedstocks lead to CO, emissions—because even materials like
asphalt and durable plastics will eventually be oxidized over a
very long time—and that all biomass used as a source of energy
is renewable and therefore does not result in net CO, emissions.

"Energy is defined as the capacity to do work and is measured in joules (J), where 1 joule is the work done when a force of
1 newton (1 N = 1 kg m/s?) is applied through a distance of 1 meter. Power is the rate at which energy is transferred and
is commonly measured in watts (W), where | watt is 1 joule per second. Newton, joule, and watt are defined as units in
the International System of Units (SI). Other units used to measure energy are toe (ton of oil equivalent; 1 toe = 41.87 x
109 J), used by the oil industry; tce (ton of coal equivalent; 1 tee = 29.31 x 109 J), used by the coal industry; and kWh
(kilowatt-hours; 1 kWh = 3.6 x 10° J), used to measure electricity. Figure B-3 shows some of the commonly used units of

energy of the rotating shaft to do work—and losses in the form
of heat as the undesired byproduct caused by electric resis-

gy exiting. Energy efficiency is defined as the ratio of the desired

motor example, this is the ratio of the shaft power to the ener-
gy input electricity. In the case of natural gas for home heating,
energy efficiency is the ratio of heat energy supplied to the

heat with an 80% efficient furnace, however, requires 12/0.8,

converting primary energy to useful energy, then, is the prod-

estimates enter the efficiency calculations, the overall efficien-
cy of primary energy to services reported in the literature spans
a wide range, from 15 to 30% (Olivier and Miall, 1983; Ayres,

"The first-law efficiency of 80% gives the misleading impres-
sion that only modest improvements are possible. The second-
law efficiency of 7% says that a 15-fold reduction in final heat-
ing energy is theoretically possible.3 In practice, theoretical
maxima cannot be achieved. More realistic improvement
potentials might be in the range of half of the theoretical limit.
In addition, further improvements in the efficiency of supply-
ing services are possible by task changes—for instance, reduc-
ing the thermal heat losses of the building to be heated via bet-
ter insulated walls and windows.

"incorrect. The quoted efficiency is based on the specific process
being used to operate the furnace—combustion of fossil fuel to
produce heat. Because the combustion temperatures in a fur-
nace are significantly higher than those desired for the energy
service of space heating, the service is not well-matched to the
source, and the result is an inefficient application of the device
and fuel. Rather than focusing on the efficiency of a given tech-
nique for the provision of the energy service of space heating,
one needs to investigate the theoretical limits of the efficiency
of supplying heat to a building based on the actual temperature
regime between the desired room temperature and the heat sup-
plied by a technology. The ratio of theoretical minimum energy
consumption for a particular task to the actual energy consump-
tion for the same task is called exergy or second-law (of ther-
modynamics) efficiency.
"	Text
"How much energy is needed for a particular energy service?
The answer to this question is not so straightforward. It
depends on the type and quality of the desired energy service;
the type of conversion technology; the fuel, including the way
the fuel is supplied; and the surroundings, infrastructures, and
organizations that provide the energy service. Initially, energy-
efficiency improvements can be achieved in many instances
without elaborate analysis through common sense, good
housekeeping, and leak-plugging practices. Obviously, energy
service efficiencies improve as a result of sealing leaking win-
dow frames or installing a more efficient furnace. If the service
is transportation—getting to and from work, for example—
using a transit bus jointly with other commuters is more energy-
efficient than taking individual automobiles. After the easiest
improvements have been made, however, the analysis must go
far beyond energy accounting.
"	Text
"The following example should help clarify the difference
between energy and exergy. A well-insulated room contains a
small container of kerosene surrounded by air. The kerosene is
ignited and burns until the container is empty. The net result is a
small temperature increase of the air in the room (“enriched”
with the combustion products). Assuming no heat leaks from the
room, the total quantity of energy in the room has not changed.
What has changed, however, is the quality of energy. The initial
fuel-air combination has a greater potential to perform useful
tasks than the resulting slightly warmer air mixture. For exam-
ple, one could use the fuel to generate electricity or operate a
motor vehicle. The ability of a slightly warmed room to perform
any useful task other than space conditioning is very limited. In
fact, the initial potential of the fuel-air combination or the “exer-
gy” has been largely lost.? Although energy is conserved, exergy
is destroyed in all real-life energy conversion processes. This is
what the second law of thermodynamics expresses.
"	Text
"1 Exergy is defined as the maximum amount of energy that under
given (ambient) thermodynamic conditions can be converted into
any other form of energy; it is also known as availability or work
potential (WEC, 1992b). Therefore, exergy defines the minimum
theoretical amount of energy required to perform a given task.

2 An alternative example: In terms of energy, 1 kWh of electricity
and the heat contained in 43 kg of 20°C water are equal (i.c., 3.6
M5). At ambient conditions, it is obvious that 1 kWh electricity has
a much larger potential to do work (e.g., to turn a shaft or to pro-
vide light) than the 43 kg of 20°C water. See also Moran, 1989.

3 For example, instead of combusting a fossil fuel, Goldemberg et al.
(1988) give the example of a heat pump, which extracts heat from a
local environment (outdoor air, indoor exhaust air, groundwater)
and delivers it into the building. A heat pump operating on electrici-
ty can supply 12 units of heat for 3 to 4 units of electrical energy.
The second-law efficiency improves to 25-33% for this particular
task— still considerably below the theoretical maximum efficiency.
Not accounted for in this example, however, are energy losses dur-
ing electricity generation. Assuming a modern gas-fired, combined-
cycle power plant with 50% efficiency, the overall efficiency gain is
still a factor of two compared with a gas furnace heating system.

"The principal advantage of second-law efficiency is that it
relates actual efficiency to the theoretical (ideal) maximum.
Although this theoretical maximum can never be reached,
low-exergy efficiencies identify those areas with the largest
potentials for efficiency improvement. For fossil fuels, this
suggests the areas that also have the highest emission-mitigation
potentials.

"The theoretical potential for efficiency improvements is very
large; current energy systems are nowhere close to the maxi-
mum levels suggested by the second law of thermodynamics.
However, the full realization of this potential is impossible.
Friction, resistance, and similar losses never can be totally
avoided. In addition, there are numerous barriers and inertias to
be overcome, such as social behavior, vintage structures,
financing of capital costs, lack of information and know-how,
and insufficient policy incentives.

"Global primary energy consumption has grown at an average
annual rate of about 2% per year for almost 2 centuries—
doubling, on average, about every 3 decades. This estimate

is a considerable variation in energy consumption growth rates
over time and between different regions. For example, the glob-

0.3% per year between 1990 and 1994. Emissions and other

mal energy conversion. The dynamics of structural changes in
the global energy system, illustrated in Figure B-5, can be char-
acterized by relatively slow rates of change, which are typical
for infrastructures. It took about half a century before coal was
replaced by crude oil as the dominant global energy source. At
the global level, the “time constant” for fundamental energy
transitions has been on the order of 50 years. At the regional
level and for individual energy technologies and devices, the
characteristic time constants are usually shorter, as a result of
faster capital turnover, among other factors.

"There are many difficulties and definitional ambiguities
involved in estimating the exergy efficiencies for compre-
hensive energy source-to-service chains or entire energy sys-
tems. There are many examples for the analysis of individual
conversion devices; for instance, losses around a thermal
power plant are described in Yasni and Carrington (1989). A
few attempts have also been made to analyze energy systems
efficiencies to useful energy or even to energy services. All
indicate that primary-to-service (second-law or exergy) effi-
ciencies are as low as a few percent. AIP (1975) and Olivier
and Miall (1983) were among the first to give detailed
assessments of end-use exergy efficiencies, including service
efficiencies. Ayres (1989) calculates an overall primary exer-
gy to service efficiency of 2.5% for the United States. Wall
(1990) estimates a primary-to-useful exergy efficiency in
Japan of 21%, and Wall et al. (1994) calculate a primary-to-
useful exergy. efficiency of less than 15% for Italy. Schaeffer
and Wirtshafter (1992) estimate a primary-to-useful energy
efficiency of 32% and an exergy efficiency of 23% for
Brazil. Other estimates include Rosen (1992) for Canada,
and Ozdogan and Arikol (1995) for Turkey. Estimates of
global and regional primary-to-service exergy efficiencies
vary from ten to as low as a few percent (Gilli e¢ al., 1990,
1995; Nakicenovic ef al., 1990, 1993).

"25% of the world’s population consume almost 80% of the
global energy. Cumulative consumption is even more uneven-
ly distributed: About 85% of all energy used to date has been
consumed by less than 20% of the cumulative global popula-
tion (measured in cumulative person-years) since 1860. The
differences in current per capita commercial energy consump-
tion are more than a factor of 20 between the highest (North
America) and the lowest (Africa) energy-consuming regions in
the world—but more than a factor of 500 between individual
countries. Another important difference is in the structure of
energy supply, especially the strong reliance on traditional and
noncommercial sources of energy in the developing countries

"The historical shifts from traditional energy sources and coal to
crude oil and natural gas were accompanied by the develop-
ment of elaborate conversion systems for the production of
more suitable forms of final energy, such as electricity. These
structural changes, together with improvements in the perfor-
mance of individual energy technologies, have resulted in sig-
nificant efficiency improvements. Efficiency improvements in
converting primary sources to final and useful energy forms,
along with economic structural change, have contributed to a
reduction of specific primary energy needs for generating a
unit of economic output, usually measured in terms of gross
domestic product (GDP) or gross national product (GNP). This
ratio is often called energy intensity. Figure B-6 illustrates the
changes in energy intensity for a number of world regions and
countries and shows that, on average, 1% less energy per year
was required every successive year to generate a unit of eco-
nomic output. Actual variations of energy intensities and their
improvement rates are large—depending, for instance, on the

"The largest final energy share of 38% is taken by oil products,
half of them being used in the transport sector and constituting
96% of all the energy needs in this sector. The largest final
energy carrier in industry is coal at 30%, accounting for almost
70% of all the direct uses of coal. Two-thirds of primary coal
is used for electricity generation. About 30% of natural gas is
used for electricity generation; the rest is divided almost equal-
ly between industrial uses and those in the household, com-
mercial, and agricultural sectors. Electricity is also almost
equally divided between these end uses. Most traditional bio-
mass is used locally, with little or no conversion, and is shown
under the “other” sector category in Table B-2. Primary energy
consumption is well-documented in both national and interna-
tional statistics. An exception is the use of traditional noncom-
mercial energy (biomass). Larger uncertainties surround sec-
toral disaggregations of final energy consumption, due to a
lack of detailed statistics in many countries. The numbers on
sectoral final energy use given in Table B-2 are estimates. In
some cases, alternative estimates are presented in individual
chapters that deal with sectoral energy issues.

result in some CO, and other GHG emissions, either because fossil
energy is embodied in their construction materials (e.g., concrete in
the structures of a nuclear power plant or a hydroelectric dam) or
because fossil energy is required for operation and maintenance of
energy facilities (e.g., gasoline and diesel vehicles). Some renew-
able sources also can entail CO, and other GHG emissions during
operation. Examples include CO, emissions from geothermal; CHy
emissions from anaerobic decay of biomass in flooded hydropower
reservoirs; or CHy, CO, and N,O emissions from biomass burning.

evaluated at 3 million tons of natural uranium in January 1993

of electricity—or about 1,800 EJ thermal equivalent if used in
convertor reactors with a once-through fuel cycle (Le., without
reprocessing or final disposal of spent fuel) or to more than
100,000 EJ if used in fast breeder reactors (see Table B-3). In addi-
tion, some 4 million tons of natural uranium (corresponding to
2,300 EJ thermal) are known to exist; part of this supply is in
countries where recovery costs have not been estimated. Uranium
resources recoverable from unconventional ore bodies or as a
byproduct amount to some 7 million tons of natural uranium (4,100
EJ thermal). Resources, estimated through geological assessment,
amount to some 10 to 11 million tons of natural uranium (5,800 to
6,400 EJ thermal). Additional occurrences that cannot be exploited
with current technologies include seawater, with an estimated nat-
ural uranium energy content exceeding one million EJ. Thorium

natural flows of renewable energy worldwide and their techni-
cal recovery potentials, as well as estimates for more practical
potentials that could be achieved by 2020-2025 with current
and near- to medium-term technologies and cost structures.
The concept of technical potential can be used in a similar
fashion as the concept of energy resources, and potentials by
2020 as the concept of energy reserves. The fundamental dif-
ference, of course, is that renewable potentials represent annu-
al flows available, in principle, on a sustainable basis indefi-
nitely, whereas fossil energy reserves and resources, although
expanding in time, are fundamentally finite quantities. Life-
cycle analyses remain important because although the energy
flows are sustainable they still require materials like concrete
and copper and the commitment of land and other resources.
The renewable energy potentials identified in Table B-4 are
theoretically large enough to provide the current primary ener-
gy needs for the world, and the technical potentials are large
enough to cover most of the conceivable future growth of glob-

tial is about 10 to 100 times smaller (Cavanagh et al., 1993;
WEC, 1993b; Baker, 1991; Sgrensen, 1979).

"geothermal energy to a depth of 5 km is more than 126 million
EJ (Palmerini, 1993), but occurrences within easily accessible
layers of the crust reduce the technical potential. The annual
flow from Earth is estimated at about 800 EJ/yr (Sgrensen,
1979). The long-term technical potential could be greater than
20 EJ—especially if deep drilling costs can be reduced, as
these are a major limitation to this energy source.

"Energy-related options for controlling the sources and enhanc-

degree, in all of the mitigation chapters. Chapter 19 assesses
energy supply mitigation options, and the following three
chapters, 20 through 22, consider individual sectors—industry,
transportation, and human settlements, respectively. In addi-

biomass) are considered in Chapters 23 and 24 on agriculture

"All conceivable human energy needs could be provided for by
diverting only a small fraction of the solar influx to energy use,
assuming that a significantly large area could be devoted to
solar energy gathering because of low spatial energy densities.
Solar thermal and photovoltaic demonstration power plants are
operating in a number of countries. Many gigawatts (GW) of
installed electric capacity could be constructed after a few
years of development. The main challenge is to reduce capital
costs. Other proposals also have been made—for instance,
placing solar power satellites in space.

"Four general categories of biomass energy resources are used
for fuels: fuelwood, wastes, forests, and energy plantations.
Biomass wastes originate from farm crops, animals, forestry
wastes, wood-processing byproducts, and municipal waste and
sewage. The potential of biomass energy crops and plantations
depends on the land area available, the harvestable yield, its
energy content, and the conversion efficiency. Biomass poten-
tials by 2020-2025 in Table B-4 are based on a literature sur-
vey of estimates and scenarios (Johansson et al., 1993; WEC,
1993b; Hall, 1991). The technical potential of biomass energy
crops and plantations is especially difficult to estimate. Based
on land-use capacity studies, estimates of the land available for
tropical plantations range between 580 and 620 million ha
(Houghton et al., 1991; Grainger, 1990).

"Energy-related emissions account for the largest share of CO,
sources and have varying importance in the emissions of other
GHGs. Global primary energy needs are expected to increase
anywhere between 540 and 2,500 EJ by 2100, according to the
1892 IPCC scenarios. A detailed assessment and evaluation of
IPCC and other energy and emissions scenarios is provided in
An Evaluation of the IPCC IS92 Emission Scenarios (Alcamo
et al., 1995). With increases in global primary energy, GHG
emissions will continue to grow unless they are mitigated. The
general conclusion in Chapters 19 to 24 is that the technologi-
cal potential to achieve significant emission reductions is
indeed large, but there are important uncertainties regarding
the ease, timing, and cost of implementing mitigation options

"A number of chapters in this report are devoted to the assessment
of energy-related impacts of and adaptation to climate change and
to energy-related mitigation options. Vulnerability to climate
change (including impacts and adaptation) concerning the energy,
industry, and transportation sectors is considered in Chapter 11;
human settlements are covered in Chapter 12. The general con-
clusion is that the sensitivity of the energy, industry, and trans-
portation sectors is relatively low, whereas the capacity for
autonomous adaptation is expected to be high if climate change is
relatively gradual and not too drastic. Infrastructure and activities
in these sectors would be susceptible to sudden changes and sur-
prises; however, the subsectors most sensitive to climate change
include agroindustry, renewable energy production including
hydroelectric generation, construction, and manufacturing heavily
dependent on water supplies. The most vulnerable human settle-
ments are located in damage-prone areas of the developing world
that do not have resources to cope with impacts.

"The energy flux of the atmosphere corresponds to about
200,000 EJ/yr of wind energy. The height limitations of wind
converters, the distance of offshore sites, and insufficient wind
velocities and land use ail limit the practical potential. The ulti-
mate potential of wind-generated electricity worldwide could
indeed be very large: Some estimates place it at 50 times cur-
rent global final electricity consumption (Grubb and Meyer,
1993;-WEC, 1993b; Cavallo et al., 1993; Gipe, 1991; Hiifele et
al., 1981). Wind electricity is produced at many sites, and it is
often also an economic option for electricity generation. The
conversion efficiency is not the real barrier to the successful
operation of wind-powered electricity generators. The techno-
logical challenge is that wind velocity is not constant in mag-
nitude and direction. To utilize much higher windspeeds off-
shore, one option is to install floating windmills and to trans-
port the electricity generated directly to the location of con-
sumption or to use it for on-board hydrogen production.

shown by observations from the past, experimental studies, and
simulation models based on current ecophysiological and eco-
logical understanding. In particular, the following was concluded:

"Compared with other latitudinal zones, the potential
area for temperate forests is projected to change the
least; however, many existing forests will still under-
go significant changes in their species composition
(High Confidence).

Water availability will change in many regions, and in
some regions where water supply is already marginal,
forests may be lost in response to increased summer
droughts (Medium Confidence).

While warming and elevated CO, are likely to
increase net primary productivity of many forests, net
carbon storage may not increase because of the asso-
ciated stimulation of soil organic matter decomposi-
tion by soil warming (Medium Confidence).
Temperate forests are currently a carbon sink, mainly
because of regrowth that started in many regions in the
19th century. However, these forests could become a
source if they degrade due to climate change or other
causes such as air pollution (Medium Confidence).
"	List
"Tropical forests are likely to be more affected by
changes in land use than by climate change as long as
deforestation continues at its current high rate (High
Confidence).

Any degradation of tropical forests, whether it is
caused by climate or land-use changes, will lead to an
irreversible loss in biodiversity (High Confidence).
CO, fertilization may have its greatest effect in the trop-
ics and may lead to a gain in net carbon storage in undis-
turbed forests, especially in the absence of nutrient lim-
itations (Medium Confidence).

Tropical forests are likely to be more affected by
changes in soil water availability (caused by the com-
bined effects of changes in temperature and rainfall)
than by changes in temperature per se. Decreases in
soil moisture may accelerate forest loss in many areas
where water availability is already marginal. In other
areas, increasing precipitation may be more than ade-
quate to meet increased evaporative demand and may
even lead to erosion (Medium Confidence).
"	List
"sustained increases of as little as 1°C in mean annual
air temperature can be sufficient to cause changes in
the growth and regeneration capacity of many tree
species. In several regions, this can significantly alter
the function and composition of forests; in others, it
can cause forest cover to disappear completely
(Medium Confidence).

Suitable habitats for many species or forest types are
likely to shift faster with climate change than the maxi-
mum natural rate at which many species can migrate and
establish. Consequently, slow-growing species, such as
late successional species, or those with restricted seed
dispersal will be replaced by faster-growing, highly
adaptable or more mobile species (High Confidence).
Forests are particularly vulnerable to extremes of
water availability (either drought or waterlogging)
and will decline rapidly if conditions move toward
one of the extremes (High Confidence).

Forced by a doubled carbon dioxide (2 x CO,) cli-
mate, global models project that a substantial fraction
of the existing forests will experience climatic condi-
tions under which they do not currently exist; eventu-
ally, large forested areas will have to change from the
current to new major vegetation types (High
Confidence). Averaged over all zones, the models pre-
dict that 33% of the currently forested area could be
affected by such changes; in the boreal zone, one
model projects it to be as high as 65% (Medium
Confidence). Yet it is currently not possible to predict
transient forest responses at a regional to global scale.
Although net primary productivity may increase, the
standing biomass of forests may not increase because
of more frequent outbreaks and extended ranges of
pests and pathogens and increasing frequency and
intensity of fires (Medium Confidence).

Mature forests are a large store of terrestrial carbon.
Because the maximum rate at which carbon can be
lost is greater than the rate at which it can be gained,
large amounts of carbon may be released transiently
into the atmosphere as forests change in response to a
changing climate and before new forests replace the
former vegetation. The loss of aboveground carbon

alone has been estimated to be 0.1-3.4 Gt yr! or a

"Northem treelines are likely to advance slowly into
regions currently occupied by tundra. (High Confidence).
Increased fire frequency and pest outbreaks are likely
to decrease the average age, biomass, and carbon
store, with greatest impact at the southern boundary
where the boreal coniferous forest is likely to give
way to temperate-zone pioneer species or grasslands
(Medium Confidence).

The net primary productivity of forests not limited by
water availability is likely to increase in response to
warming, partly mediated by increased nitrogen mineral-
ization. However, there may be a net loss of carbon from
the ecosystem because of associated increases in soil
organic matter decomposition (Medium Confidence).

"Forest ecosystems respond to environmental changes with time
constants ranging from hours to decades and up to millennia
(see Box 1-1); they are among the components of the biosphere
that respond most slowly to climatic change. The role of forest
dynamics in the global climatic system is likely to be long last-
ing, complex, and difficult to predict. Because of their longevi-
ty and because adaptive measures, such as replacement of
species, are harder to implement than in agricultural systems,
forests may be particularly vulnerable to climatic change.
"	Text
"Equilibrium projections of forest responses implicitly assume the climate to have stabilized at a new steady state, which
is not likely to occur soon in reality. However, GCM-derived climate scenarios arbitrarily held constant (e.g., for 2050)
allow an assessment of the direction and magnitude of the expected change. Equilibrium projections for future forests,
therefore, represent conservative interpretations of minimal changes likely to occur sooner or later and hence include the
potential of even greater biospheric changes than the ones currently simulated by the forest models.

"Globally, forests in 1990 covered about one-fourth of the
Earth’s land surface (3.4 Gha: FAO, 1993b), although estimates
differ due to the exact definition of forests (e.g., 4.1 Gha: Dixon
et al., 1994; or, in a very wide definition, 5.3 Gha: Sharma et al.,
1992). About 17% of high-latitude, 20% of mid-latitude, and
4% of low-latitude forests can be considered actively managed
(see Chapter 24), but only about 100 Mha (~2%) consist of
intensively managed plantations (Dixon et al., 1994), The for-
est regions have been broadly subdivided into latitudinal zones
(i.e., the tropical, temperate, and boreal zones).
"	Text
"Some of the limitations caused by this problem can be overcome in local analyses using downscaling techniques (e.g.,
Gyalistras et al., 1994), but for global applications the implicit assumption must be made that the probability of extreme
events will remain unchanged. Most transient changes in the structure of forests, such as the decline of certain tree
species, are driven by a combination of climatic changes and are modified by local, biological interactions acting on tem-
poral scales ranging from months to centuries. It is currently very difficult, therefore, to assess the likely rates of climate-
driven, transient change in forests. However, possible future equilibrium conditions can be more adequately predicted.
"	Text
"As components of the global climatic system, forests play a
major role in the present and projected future carbon budget,
since they store about 80% of all aboveground and 40% of all
belowground terrestrial organic carbon (e.g., Melillo et al.,
1990; Dixon et al., 1994) and can act as sources through
deforestation and degradation, as well as sinks through foresta-
tion and possibly enhanced growth (see Chapter 23 on the role
of forests for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions).
Moreover, forests can directly affect the climate system from
local up to continental scales: They influence ground tempera-
tures, evapotranspiration, surface roughness, albedo, cloud for-
mation, and precipitation (e.g., Henderson-Sellers et al., 1988;
Gash and Shuttleworth, 1991).

"Forests are among those ecosystems on Earth that remain
the least disturbed by human influences. They are of great
socioeconomic importance as a source of timber, pulpwood for
paper making, fuel, and many non-wood products (see Chapter
15). Furthermore, forests provide the basis for a broad range of
other economic and non-economic values, such as resources
for tourism, habitat for wildlife, or the protection of water
resources. Forests harbor the majority of the world’s biodiver-
sity (mainly in the tropics) and, as such, they represent indis-
pensable, self-maintaining repositories of genetic resources.
These are essential for improvements in crop and timber selec-
tion and in medicine. Finally, aside from special economic
interests, forests are also of spiritual importance to many
indigenous people.

"Climatic changes affect forests on spatial scales ranging from leaves to the canopy and on temporal scales from minutes
to centuries; relevant climatic changes occur at all levels, from short-term weather fluctuations creating disturbances
(such as frosts) to longer-term changes in average climatic conditions (such as moisture availability or the length of the
growing season) or the frequency of extreme events (such as droughts, fires, or intense storms). Current climate models
(GCMs) do not fully match these levels, since they are best at simulating average conditions at a relatively coarse spatial
resolution and are usually not yet run for longer than a century. Changes in frequencies of extreme events are highly
uncertain, as are local-scale climate changes, although both are of high relevance to forests.

change may exceed these thresholds, as discussed in Section
1.3.5. Climatic warming and associated lower humidities and
increase in the frequency and severity of droughts would
increase the incidence and severity of wildfires, especially in
the boreal region. Changes in fire or storm frequencies are like-
ly to have major impacts on the composition, age-distribution,
and biomass of forests (see Sections 1.5.4.5 and 1.6.4.4).

"The survival of many species depends critically on temperature
thresholds ranging from +12° to -60°C (e.g., Woodward, 1987;
Prentice et al., 1992; Box 1-2). Many species have narrow tem-
perature niches for growth and reproduction. A sustained increase
in mean annual temperature of 1°C may cause significant
changes in the species composition of stands and hence the dis-
tribution of many tree species (Davis and Botkin, 1985; see also
Section 1.3). Trees are also sensitive to changes in water avail-
ability during the growing season, and leaf area indices, volume
growth, and the range boundaries of most tree species are strong-
ly related to water availability (Holdridge, 1967; Hinckley et al.,
1981; Gholz, 1982; Austin et a/., 1990; Stephenson, 1990).

"Forests are highly dependent on climate in their function (e.g.,
growth) and structure (e.g., species composition). Forest distri-
bution is generally limited by either water availability or tem-
perature. The ratio of actual evapotranspiration (the amount
allowed by available precipitation) to potential evapotranspira-
tion (the amount the atmosphere would take up if soil moisture
were not limiting) determines the maximum leaf area index
that can be supported (Woodward, 1987). Forests are also usu-
ally absent where the mean temperature of the warmest month
falls below 10°C (Képpen, 1936) or where the temperature
sum above a 5°C threshold is less than 350 degree-days
(Prentice et al., 1992).

"Changes in the regional or seasonal pattern of climate,
such as the temperature increases that are expected to
be greatest at high latitudes, and there, greatest in win-
ter (Greco et al., 1994), Due to this, impacts on forests
at high latitudes may be greater than elsewhere.
Water shortages during the growing season.
Decreasing summer precipitation together with
increased evaporative demand would lead to decreas-
es in soil water, especially in many mid-latitude
regions where water is most critical for growth. It is
important to note that water shortages can develop
even with unchanged rainfall amounts, due to
increasing temperatures causing increased evapora-
tive demand. We expect significant regional varia-
tion, with water availability changing only marginal-
ly in some regions and improving in others, whereas
in many other regions water availability may
decrease drastically.

"Trees have widely differing responses to temperature. Some tropical tree species suffer chilling injury at temperatures
below +12°C (Lyons, 1973; Lyons et al., 1979), whereas species of colder regions can survive -5°C without ice forma-
tion but are sterile at lower temperatures. Classic examples for this phenomenon are /lex and Hedera (Iversen, 1944).
Broad-leaved evergreen perennials can survive to a limit of about -15°C by supercooling, whereas broad-leaved decidu-
ous trees can supercool to about -40°C (Arris and Eagleson, 1989). Evergreen needle-leaved trees can survive to about
-60°C, below which only deciduous species survive. Apart from these killing temperatures, many species require certain
minimum numbers of degree days to complete essential life-cycle processes such as bud initiation, pollen formation,
flowering, or others (Stern and Roche, 1974). Others require particular sequences of cool temperatures to become frost-
hardy at the optimum time and a minimum duration of chilling temperatures to break winter dormancy (Cannell, 1990).
Insect pests and other biotic agents that affect forest health may have critical threshold subzero temperatures for winter
survival and thermal times to complete a generation. Warming may have positive effects on the growth of many trees
and their survival, but by being beneficial to insect pests it also may reduce tree survival or put cold-adapted species at a
competitive disadvantage.

"Changes in climate forcing are expected to be one or
two orders of magnitude faster than rates of climatic
change experienced by forests during most of the past
100,000 to 200,000 years, except, perhaps, during the
Younger Dryas Event 10,000 years ago (Dansgaard et
al., 1989; Webb III and Bartlein, 1992; Gates, 1993),
Such rapid climatic change would have particular
impacts on forests. For example, there may be forest
decline, interruption of tree life cycles, loss of slowly
migrating species, and increasing abundance of more
aggressive, early successional species.

"When they are well supplied with water, trees of most temper-
ate and boreal species respond to increased temperature (e.g.,
from year to year, or when planted at a slightly warmer loca-
tion) by growing faster (e.g., Cannell et al., 1989; Beuker,
1994), and they reach their largest mass near the warmest
boundaries of their geographic ranges (Korzukhin et al., 1989).
Generally, there is a positive correlation between net primary
productivity and temperature (Box, 1978; Kauppi and Posch,
1985; Kokorin et al., 1993; Morikawa, 1993) or between
net primary productivity and actual evapotranspiration

"At the ecophysiological level, plant organs like stomata and
leaves respond almost instantaneously to their environment.
This mainly affects forest functions, such as net primary pro-
ductivity. Some structural aspects, such as leaf area, may
respond over a number of years, whereas others, such as species
composition, may take centuries to respond to altered condi-
tions. Typically, each species or plant functional type (PFT) is
affected differently by climatic change: Some species or PFTs
will remain unaffected, some will become more and others less
competitive (Smith et al., 1993). Dynamic forest models can be
used to simulate this transient behavior of forests (e.g., Shugart,
1984; Prentice et al., 1993). Landscape-scale processes such as
the lateral interactions between neighboring patches (c.g.,
migration or fire) play an important role for possible changes in
the local to regional pattern of many forest ecosystems.
However, they become less relevant when aggregated to nation-
al or continental assessments. At the global level, it is currently

may not increase, and may even become negative, because
warmer temperatures also greatly stimulate soil organic matter
decomposition (e.g., Raich and Schlesinger, 1992; Lloyd and
Taylor, 1994; Kirschbaum, 1995; Chapter A). This could
release large amounts of CO, to the atmosphere (e.g.,

"water has been used up, tissue water potentials fall below
threshold levels and growth ceases. Growth under these condi-

Tolley and Strain, 1985; Morison, 1987; Eamus and Jarvis,

should be most pronounced under water-limited conditions
(e.g., Gifford, 1979; Allen, 1990). While increasing CO, con-
centration may be beneficial for plant growth, some
researchers rank it of less importance than changes in temper-
ature and/or precipitation, which can have large impacts when
critical thresholds of drought, chilling, or degree-days are
reached (e.g., Solomon, 1988).

"GCMs suggest a globally averaged increase in precipitation of
about 2.5% per degree warming (Mitchell et al., 1990; Greco
et al., 1994), which may not be sufficient to meet the increased
water requirements of forests. Most GCMs indicate significant
declines in net soil moisture over continental areas during the
growing season (e.g., Manabe and Weatherald, 1987; Greco et
al., 1994). There are likely to be considerable regional differ-
ences, however, with some regions likely to receive increased
rainfall sufficient to meet increased evaporative demand and
other regions receiving even less rainfall than at present.
Because the present distribution of species and plant function-
al types is strongly determined by the total (Holdridge, 1967;
Box, 1981; Hinckley et al., 1981; Austin et al., 1990) and sea-
sonal availability of water (Stephenson, 1990; Prentice et al.,

affect the distribution of species (see Section 1.3.2).

"The importance of CO, fertilization continues to be controver-
sial (e.g., K6rner, 1993; Idso and Idso, 1994; see also Chapter
A). While the response of photosynthesis to CO, concentration
can be readily observed at the single-leaf or isolated plant level
(Kimball, 1983; Cure and Acock, 1986; Mooney et al., 1991;
Luxmoore et al., 1993; Wullschleger et al., 1995), it has been
argued that this initial benefit may be negated by the various
feedbacks in the plant and soil (e.g., Bazzaz and Fajer, 1992;
Diaz et al., 1993; Korner, 1993). Quantification of some of
these feedbacks has been attempted (e.g., Comins and
McMurtrie, 1993; Kirschbaum et al., 1994) but has not yet
been possible for the great diversity of natural habitats, in
which most of the feedback effects are still inadequately under-
stood and poorly quantified. Experimental approaches have not
yet resolved this controversy because of the enormous costs
and technical difficulties involved. Only a small number of
open-air CO, enrichment experiments have been conducted
with mature natural populations—-and none on forests.

"Enhanced decomposition of soil organic matter also should
have the effect of mineralizing nutrients—especially nitrogen
and phosphorus—that are held in soil organic matter and mak-
ing them available for plant growth (e.g., Shaver et al., 1992;
Melillo et al., 1993). This is likely to be of greatest importance
in cool regions of the world, which are mostly nitrogen-limited
and often contain large amounts of organic matter (Post et al.,
1982). This could sometimes lead to an increase in total carbon
storage in systems if nutrients are redistributed from compo-
nents with low C:N ratios (i.e., soil organic matter) to compo-
nents with high C:N ratios (i.e., woody stems) (Rastetter et al.,
1992; Chapter 9, Terrestrial Biotic Responses to Environmental
Change and Feedbacks to Climate, in the Working Group I
volume). In industrialized regions, nitrogen deposition from
the atmosphere may enhance NPP and NEP, leading to
increased total carbon storage in forest ecosystems (Kauppi et
al., 1992), provided deposition has not reached levels that
cause forest decline (Durka et al., 1994).

"Any species’ survival is influenced by many factors, and the set of environmental conditions in which it can exist and
reproduce is called its niche. A distinction must be made between a species’ fundamental niche and its realized niche
(Hutchinson, 1957; Malanson et al., 1992). The fundamental niche encompasses all environmental conditions in which a
species could potentially grow and reproduce with its specific physiological characteristics. The realized niche encom-
passes those conditions in which a species is actually found. The latter is usually a subset of the fundamental niche due
to competition by other species (see Chapter A). Only rarely does the realized niche coincide with the fundamental one
(Woodward, 1987; Booth et al., 1988; Austin et al., 1994). Examples of typical environmental factors that determine a
species’ niche are temperature and precipitation (see Figure 1-1).

have recently become available that enable us to make estimates

grow into adults in climates that may be unsuitable in 50-100

vive current climatic conditions at those sites. A net ecosystem-
level impact may be the loss of slow-growing species and the
selection of species that complete their life cycles more quick-
ly, such as early successional trees and shrubs. The ability to
reach reproductive maturity in a short time favors early suc-
cessional species that grow in full sun, whereas slower-grow-
ing species that begin their life cycles as understory species
under closed canopies may be lost. Some model simulations
have indicated that this opening of closed forests could result
in the loss of three quarters of the trees and aboveground car-

to the geographic distribution of areas potentially suitable for
forests and the performance of trees under different environ-
mental conditions but also to the effect of climate change on
the functioning and structure of ecosystems during the tran-
sient phase. For instance, it is well known that changing ambi-
ent conditions can reduce growth in forest ecosystems (e.g.,
Solomon and Webb II, 1985; Shugart et al., 1986; Solomon,
1986; Woodwell, 1987; Prentice ef al., 1991b; Botkin and
Nisbet, 1992; Davis and Zabinski, 1992). Moreover, the mag-
nitude of climate change will subject many species assem-
blages, within a life cycle of their main species and in most of
their distribution area, to climates that now occur outside their
current ecological range (e.g., Solomon ef al., 1984; Roberts,
1989; Davis and Zabinski, 1992).

"al., 1995), these models can be used to project transient changes
in species composition of selected forest types for scenarios of
climatic change in the past (Solomon et ai., 1981; Lotter and
Kienast, 1992) or future (Pastor and Post, 1988; Kienast, 1991;
Friend et al., 1993; Bugmann, 1994; Bugmann and Fischlin,
1994; Smith et al., 1994; see Box 1-4). These simulations sug-
gest that climate change could cause widespread tree mortality
within a few decades (Solomon et al., 1984; Solomon, 1986;
Solomon and West, 1987; Pastor and Post, 1988; Kienast, 1991;
Prentice e7 al., 1991b; Bugmann, 1994; Bugmann and Fischlin,
1994). Solomon and Bartlein (1992) and Pastor and Post
(1993), for example, show how lags in population responses to
climatic change could result in transient decreases in NPP
before better-adapted species eventually replace the original
vegetation and result in enhanced growth. It also should be
noted that many simulations show species compositions that are
not present in existing forests (Bugmann, 1994; Bugmann and

"Regrowth of better-adapted species or forest types requires many
decades to centuries (Dobson et al., 1989; Kienast and Kréuchi,
199i; Bugmann and Fischlin, 1994). Consequently, regions with
forests in decline could release large amounts of carbon (e.g.,
Smith and Shugart, 1993), producing a large transient pulse of
CO, into the atmosphere (e.g., Neilson, 1993; Chapter 9,
Terrestrial Biotic Responses to Environmental Change and
Feedbacks to Climate, in the Working Group I volume). Whereas
some authors have estimated this carbon pulse from aboveground
carbon alone to fall within a range of 0.1 to 3.4 Gt yr! for the
annual flux, or 10 to 240 Gt for the accumulated pulse (King and
Neilson, 1992), others have estimated a total carbon pulse from
above and belowground C as high as 200 to 235 Gt, to be released
to the atmosphere during a few decades to a century (see Section
1.3.4; Neilson, 1993; Smith and Shugart, 1993). Such responses,
although debatable in their magnitude, are plausible because cli-
matic changes also have been implicated in past episodes of for-
est and species decline (Cook et al., 1987; Hamburg and Cogbill,

"Most forest succession models are based on the gap dynamics hypothesis (Watt, 1947; Bray, 1956; Shugart, 1984). They
simulate the establishment, growth, and death of individual trees as a mixture of deterministic and stochastic processes
within small—often '/;, ha—patches and average the actual forest succession at the ecosystem level from the successional
patterns simulated for many individual plots (Shugart, 1984). Earlier work on the potential effects of climatic change on
forests had to rely on spatial correlations between forest composition and climatic variables (e.g., Davis, 1986). Similarly,
models that do not explicitly account for the differential effects of climatic change on different species may give opti-
mistic projections of the effect of climatic change on ecosystem productivity. The more complex succession models that
include the feedbacks between climate and ecosystem processes provide a more pessimistic outlook (see Figure 1—2).
"	Text
"On the other hand, most of these models do not include direct effects of increasing CO, concentration, which can ame-
liorate projected forest decline (e.g., Post et al., 1992). Also, because of the limited availability of data on the fundamen-
tal niche of most species, these models are parameterized with information about the realized niche only (Austin, 1992).
It has been argued that this might cause succession models to overestimate the extent of forest decline during the tran-
sient phase (e.g., Malanson ef al., 1992). Despite these caveats, patch models are the best tools currently available to
study transient effects during climatic and other changes. Their simulations for current forests in response to past climat-
ic changes provide fairly realistic assessments of likely future conditions (e.g., Solomon and Bartlein, 1992; Bugmann,
1994), although they cannot be interpreted as actual forecasts.

van den Born, 1994; Prentice et al., 1994); MAPSS distinguish-
es 33 (Neilson, 1993)—the projected changes (Table 1-2) tend to
underestimate actual changes. Changes within a class remain by
definition undetected and would have to be modeled by means of
more detailed vegetation models.

(Wetherald and Manabe, 1986). TVM from IMAGE 2.0 generated the changed climate internally, based on comparable assump-
tions (Conventional Wisdom Scenario) about greenhouse gas concentrations (Alcamo, 1994) and land-use changes as driven by
population developments. All numbers relate to a potential forest vegetation in equilibrium with the climate, a steady state that
is unlikely to be reached for many centuries. All figures were compiled by using the maximum number of vegetation classes as
supported by the models (i.e., more than the 10 classes shown in Figures 1-3 to 1-7). D = Total forested area in transition from
current type into a new one; s, = Total forested area remaining within the same vegetation class; D* = Net change (data com-

"The models differ in their emphasis on particular processes
and relationships (Leemans et al., 1995). For example,
BIOME (Prentice e¢ al., 1992) includes physiologically impor-
tant aspects such as seasonality and moisture balance, and is
based on PFTs, which to some extent simulate interspecific
competition. MAPSS, on the other hand, couples the rate of
transpiration to the conductance of the canopy by simulating
maximum leaf-area index and stomatal conductance (Neilson
et al., 1994; Neilson and Marks, 1994). The latter makes it pos-
sible to incorporate ecophysiological responses such as CO,
fertilization and WUE, but all species-specific information is
lumped. These models use somewhat different vegetation clas-
sification schemes [e.g., compare Prentice et al. (1992) and
Neilson (1993)], which usually makes direct comparisons pos-
sible only if some classes are aggregated (compare Figures 1-
5 to 1-7 and Table 1-2 with Prentice et al., 1992; Neilson, 1993;

substantially (Table 1-2).

"Shifts in the distribution of forest zones take place with signif-
icant time lags. The area occupied by different forest types has
been quite plastic in the past 100,000 years, responding to
changing environments with changes in species associations,
structural properties of stands, and areas occupied (Solomon
and Webb III, 1985; Webb III and Bartlein, 1992). Unlike the
Pleistocene climatic changes, which occurred over thousands
of years, future climatic changes of about the same magnitude
are expected to take place over 100 years or less.

"Averaged over all zones, this net loss amounts to 9.1% of the
currently forested area. This is partly due to the fact that some
regions are likely to lose forests for climatic reasons, while cli-
matic gains in other regions might not be realized due to land-
use pressures (IMAGE), and some models even predict a net
loss (MAPSS). Averaged over all zones and all models, the pro-
jections indicate that 33% of the currently forested area is like-
ly to change from the current vegetation class to a new one in
response to climate forcing as generated by the GFDL 2 x CO,
scenario. Compared with other GCMs, the latter represents a
medium global warming scenario.

"The boreal regions, especially, are expected to undergo large
vegetation shifts, with both MAPSS and BIOME projecting
large changing areas (Table 1-2, D). Both models show large
losses in area for current boreal forests, despite their encroach-
ment into current tundra. Shrinkage in total area due to the geo-
graphically limited poleward shift leads to a net loss between
379 Mha (25.9%) and 529 Mha (22.5%).3 The IMAGE model
is an exception in this case; it projects much smaller losses of
only 33 Mha (2.9%) (Figures 1-5, 1-6, and 1-7). This is main-
ly due to the structure of the model, in which vegetation change
is primarily driven by human land use—which is not an impor-
tant factor in the boreal zone.
"	Text
"Although BIOME and MAPSS indicate relatively small net
changes (Table 1-2, D*) in tropical dry forests, the actual
changes encompass large gross losses (D), which are compen-
sated by similarly large gross gains (not shown in Table 1-2).
This is also partly true for the temperate zone, where MAPSS,
for example, projects only relatively small net losses (D*);
however, the associated gross losses (D) irrespective of gains
(not shown) are more than six times larger. Mapped distribu-
tions indicate that temperate forests are likely to replace a large
area of boreal forest, mainly due to the increase in winter tem-
peratures (Figures 1-5 and 1-6). This allows temperate-zone
vegetation to expand poleward into regions from which it is
currently excluded by the -40°C threshold for the coldest
month (Figures 1-5, 1-6, and 1-7).

IMAGE 2.0 incorporate the effect of land-use changes (e.g., deforesta-

development. Note that IMAGE 2.0, unlike the other models, simulates
climatic change independently from a GCM, since it generates its cli-
mate internally. The vegetational part (Leemans and van den Born,
1994) of the IMAGE model is similar to BIOME (Prentice et al., 1992)
and represents a mixture between a transient and a static response of
vegetation to internally as well as externally generated changes.

"The change in annual mean temperature that occurs when one
moves 100 km poleward may be as high as 0.7°C in mid- and
high latitudes, but less at low latitudes. For summer tempera-
tures and toward the interior of the continents, this value may
be higher. With altitude, temperature changes of about
0.5-0.7°C per 100 m are also common (see also Chapter 5).
With an expected warming between 0.1 and 0.35°C per decade,
this means that species would have to migrate 1.5-5.5 km
toward the poles per year or increase elevation by 1.5-5.5 m
per year in order to remain within similar climatic conditions.
Many studies of past changes have estimated natural rates of
migrations of trees ranging from 40 to 500 m per year (Davis,
1976, 1981, 1986; Huntley and Birks, 1983; Solomon et al.,
‘1984; Gear and Huntley, 1991; Torrii, 1991). Similarly, Gear
and Huntley (1991) calculated from several sites in Britain
migration rates for Scots pine of only 40-80 m yr-!. However,
for other species, such as white spruce, much faster dispersal
rates of up to 1-2 km yr""! also have been reported (e.g., Ritchie
and MacDonald, 1986). It is not always clear whether the
observed past rates were maximal rates of migration or
whether they were limited by the rate at which the climate

"changed (Prentice et al., 1991a; Prentice, 1992). Nevertheless,
it is unlikely that future rates of species migration could match
those required by the currently expected rates of climatic
change in large areas. Pollen, on the other hand, may be dis-
persed much faster than seeds (e.g., Ennos, 1994), so the move-

able to match the speed of climatic change.

"Climatic change can affect biodiversity either directly through
altering the physiological responses of species or indirectly by
altering interspecific relationships (e.g., Woodward, 1987;
Tallis, 1990; Peters and Lovejoy, 1992). Whenever these
changes lead to a habitat degradation, biodiversity will eventu-
ally be adversely affected (e.g., Peters and Lovejoy, 1992;
Vitousek, 1994), Furthermore, biodiversity is affected not only
by climate change but also by deforestation and other land-use
changes that cause further habitat degradation and fragmenta-
tion (Janzen, 1988; Dobson et al., 1989; Wilson, 1989; Ehrlich
and Wilson, 1991; Myers, 1991, 1993; Postel, 1994; Daily,

with other pressures on ecosystems produces a particularly sig-
nificant threat to biodiversity due to the following reasons:

"Since each stage of a tree’s life cycle requires specific envi-
ronmental conditions, rapid climatic change is less likely to
offer sufficiently favorable conditions to complete complex
life cycles. This is especially true for some slow-growing
species. More flexible species, such as those with wider seed
dispersal, or a more invasive growth habit, may be able to
move to more favorable habitats, whereas less mobile species
are likely to be left behind and would be at a disadvantage as
their former habitat becomes climatically unsuitable. Such a
decoupling of climate determinants from species and commu-
nity distributions probably has occurred already many times
and at many places during the last millennia (Davis, 1986). The
result has been a temporary absence of certain species for hun-
dreds and thousands of years from regions in which they were
previously capable of growing. Despite this, species diversity
also could be transiently enhanced during a time of change
because forests might form a richer mosaic of patches, consist-
ing of some remaining old trees and a variety of invaders that
are successful because of locally more favorable conditions.

"Migration of a tree species involves movement of propagules to
new locations, establishment of seedlings, growth of individu-
als to reproductive maturity (which may take from years to
decades), and production of new propagules. For long-distance
migration, these stages need to be repeated. Several bottlenecks
may be encountered: Strong competitors along the route may
suppress the completion of full life cycles or specific, mandato-
ry biological symbionts [e.g., the right species of mycorrhizal
fungi (Perry et al., 1987, 1990)], or specific pollinators for
cross-fertilization may be absent at some point. Seed produc-
tion, in particular, often depends on a phased sequence of devel-
opment over at least 2 years, including many steps from floral
bud differentiation to seed ripening (Fenner, 1991). Many
stages in this sequence could be disrupted by unsuitable climat-
ic conditions (Innes, 1994): With further warming, some
species may fail to be chilled sufficiently to release dormancy
(Murray et al., 1989; Cannell, 1990), or dormancy may be
released too early, which paradoxically could result under some
circumstances in greater frost damage (Hanninen, 1991).
Conversely, many trees flower profusely following hot, dry
conditions (Stern and Roche, 1974). Hence, differential seed
production by different species may limit rates of migration and
drive substantial changes in species distributions.

"To date, only about 1.4-1.7 million of an estimated total of
5-30 million species have been scientifically described
(Wilson, 1985, 1992; May, 1990; Ehrlich and Wilson, 1991;
Erwin, 1991; Gaston, 1991; Pimm et al., 1995), and fewer than
100,000 are known well (e.g., Wilson, 1988; Pimm et al.,
1995). About 20% of the estimated total of 250,000 plant
species are woody or tree species (e.g., Groombridge, 1992;
Reid, 1992; Pimm et al., 1995). There is poor understanding of
the factors responsible for maintenance of high biodiversity
(e.g., Grubb, 1977; Stork, 1988; Groombridge, 1992; Norton
and Ulanowicz, 1992; Myers, 1995; Pimm et al., 1995), but it
is understood that biodiversity can only be managed indirectly
through habitat and ecosystem management (e.g., Wilson,
1992). In this respect, forests are of paramount importance
because they harbor about two-thirds of all species on Earth
(Ehrlich and Wilson, 1991); tropical forests alone harbor at
least half of all species (Raven, 1988; Ehrlich and Wilson,
1991; Webb, 1995). Species diversity generally increases
strongly as one moves from colder to warmer sites (e.g.,
Groombridge, 1992), although the reasons for that trend are not
well understood. When the size of an ecosystem is reduced to
about 10% of its former size, about 50% of the species origi-
nally present generally will become extinct. Based on that rela-
tionship, it has been estimated, for instance, that a temperature
rise of 2°C would cause 10-50% of the animals currently
extant in the boreal Great Basin mountain ranges to be lost

least 40% (Mabberley, 1992). In addition to deforestation, large areas of previously undisturbed forest are being affected
by removal of wood for timber and fuel (Brown et al., 1993; Richards and Flint, 1994). Chapter 24 presents a detailed

"Consideration may therefore be given to human actions that
minimize undesirable impacts. Special attention may be given
to poor dispersers, specialists, species with small populations,
endemic species with a restricted range, peripheral species,
those that are genetically impoverished, or those that have
important ecosystem functions (Peters and Darling, 1985;
Franklin, 1988; Davis and Zabinski, 1992; Franklin et al.,
1992). These species may be assisted for a time by providing
natural migration corridors (e.g., by erecting reserves of a
north-south orientation), but many may eventually require
assisted migration to keep up with the speed with which their
suitable habitats move with climate change. Some mature
forests may be assisted by setting aside reserves at the pole-
ward border of their range, especially if they encompass
diverse altitudes, and water and nutrient regimes (Botkin and
Nisbet, 1992; Peters, 1992; Myers, 1993), or by lessening pol-
lutant stresses and land-use changes that result in forest degra-
dation (e.g., Vitousek, 1994; Daily, 1995).

"The influence of tropical forests on local and regional climate may be as important as the effects of climate on forests
(Lean and Warrilow, 1989). About 20% of the water flux to the atmosphere derives from evapotranspiration from the
land, mostly from forested areas with high annual rainfall (Westall and Stumm, 1980; Lean and Warrilow, 1989).
Deforestation can significantly reduce global evapotranspiration and increase runoff. This could affect the amount and
distribution of precipitation over wide areas (Salati and Jose, 1984). For instance, in the Amazon basin, at least 50% of
precipitation originates from evapotranspiration from within the basin (Salati et al., 1979; Salati and Jose, 1984).
Deforestation there will reduce evapotranspiration, which could reduce precipitation by about 20%—producing a season-
al dry period and increasing Jocal surface temperatures by 2°C (Gash and Shuttleworth, 1991). This could result in a
decline in the area of wet tropical rainforests and their permanent replacement by floristically poorer drought-deciduous
or dry tropical forests or woodlands.

increased soil erosion, and other forms of degradation and

deforested, reducing the 1990 area by one-third and releasing

Rates of deforestation eventually must decrease as less and less

"Fire significantly influences the structure, composition, and
age diversity of tropical forests. In dry forests, fires tend to be
frequent, which excludes fire-sensitive species. In tropical
rainforest, fire is usually rare and does not usually spread over
wide areas because there is insufficient dry and flammable
plant material (Chandler et al., 1983a, 1983b), However, there
have been instances in the past when thousands of hectares of
tropical rainforest were burned following long dry periods
(Goldammer and Seibert, 1990; Goldammer, 1992). Such fires
are likely to significantly affect species diversity (Goldammer
and Seibert, 1990) and may help prevent forest deterioration by
promoting new growth and regrowth (Goldammer and
Pefiafiel, 1990).

"The forests consist of rainforests, drought-deciduous forests,
and dry forests. In areas with prolonged dry seasons, especial-
ly where water limitations are intensified by edaphic condi-
tions (Cole, 1986), there are savannas (Richards, 1966; Odum,
1971; Borota, 1991). Evergreen or partially deciduous forests
occur in areas with a mean annual temperature greater than
24°C and with high regular rainfall throughout the year. Most
of the closed tropical forests are found in the moist and wet
zones, with precipitation to potential evapotranspiration ratios
of 1-2 and greater than 2, respectively. The dry zone, with a
ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration of less
than 1, covers about 40% of the total tropical region. In most
of these forests, typical monthly temperatures fall between 24
and 28°C; daily extremes rarely exceed 38°C or fall below
10°C (Longman and Jenik, 1987).

the more important considerations are likely to be nutrient
leaching and soil erosion wherever tree cover is lost (because
of droughts or fire) or removed (by logging, clearing, or graz-

disadvantage in those areas that experience more severe and
prolonged droughts. Significantly, drought affects the survival
of individuals: Those without morphological or physiological
adaptations to drought often die. In contrast, an abundance of
moisture (in the absence of flooding) more often acts through
changed competitive ability. Drought-adapted species are out-
competed by those that lack growth-limiting drought-adaptive
traits. Species in moist tropical forests, including economically
important hardwoods, are the least drought-adapted in the trop-
ics, and their survival (with the attendant loss in diversity) in
some areas must be considered at risk from climatic change.

"The productivities of different areas of tropical forest are likely
to increase or decrease in accordance with changes in rainfall,
as indicated by simulation studies (Raich et al., 1991). The
overall effect of predicted changes in climate (excluding elevat-
ed CO,) on the net primary productivity of tropical evergreen
forests may be a decrease due to increased temperature and con-
sequently increased respiration (in the absence of acclimation)
and decreased photosynthesis due to increased cloudiness, but
elevated CO, levels may cause an increase in productivity (in
contrast to boreal regions) unless limited by phosphorus supply
(Melillo et al., 1993), CO, enhancement of photosynthesis and
growth, particularly below ground (e.g., Norby et al., 1986,
1992; Luxmoore et al., 1993), is favored by. high temperatures
in species with C; photosynthesis (i.e., in trees) (Long, 1991;
Kirschbaum, 1994) and possibly by vegetation disturbance and
consequent fast nutrient cycling (Peterson and Melillo, 1985).
This is also consistent with studies of the spatial distribution of
CO, concentrations across the globe, which also suggest that
the tropics constitute a biospheric sink that partially offsets the
carbon release due to deforestation (Enting and Mansbridge,
1991; Schimel et ai., 1995). An alternative view is that elevated
CO, levels will accelerate carbon and nutrient cycles in tropical
ecosystems without increasing growth and biomass (Kémer and
Arnone, 1992). Researchers are agreed, however, that increased
water-use efficiency by plants in response to elevated CO, is
likely to enhance the productivity of vegetation in the drier trop-
ical regions.

"However, the diversity of species in most tropical forests
appears to confer some protection against widespread out-
breaks of pests and diseases. The low population density of
potential hosts prevents the rapid multiplication and spread of
pests and pathogens (Longman and Jenik, 1987). Hence, most
cases of debilitating outbreaks of pests and diseases—which
can, for instance, affect entire stocks of some mahoganies—
occur in plantations, agroforests, or stands that are dominated
by one species (UNESCO, 1978).

and the invasion and maintenance of fire-resistant species such

increase the dominance of pioneer species, including vines and

"Temperate forests occur approximately from 25-50° N and S

cultural land and urban areas. Closed forests originally covered
about 1,400 Mha but have been reduced to about 700 Mha,
56% of which is in North America and 24% in Europe (see
Chapter 15). Humans have had an impact on almost all of these
forests; about 20% are managed for wood production or other
uses, and many are being affected by pollutants, with both
potentially positive and some obvious negative effects on

"Temperate forests occur within a range of mean annual tem-

500 mm, with broad transition zones to boreal and subtropical
forests. Within any region there are often steep gradients in for-
est types along climate gradients of rainfall and temperature,
with change in altitude, and from oceanic to continental areas.
At the low-rainfall margin, temperate forests change into
savanna-type woodlands or Mediterranean shrublands.
Temperate forests exist on a wide range of soils and have

"The standing biomass and carbon content of temperate forests
is currently increasing (at 0.2-0.5 Gt C yr+), largely due to
reforestation (about 0.6 Mha yr), underharvesting and

sidered to be a carbon sink (Heath et al., 1993). However, if
the loss of carbon from decaying forest products and logging
debris is taken into account, the net flux of carbon to the
atmosphere from. northern temperate forests is close to zero
(Houghton, 1993) and, in the coming century, increased
demand for wood may change the temperate forests to a net
carbon source (Heath et al., 1993).

temperate-zone trees (Prentice et al., 1992). Slight shifts to
smaller ratios lead to open woodlands, savannahs, and grass-

northern ecosystems (Viereck, 1983; Payette et al., 1989b;
Payette, 1992). There are well-established relationships
between fire-cycle length, species composition, age-class dis-
tribution, and carbon storage (Johnson and Larson, 1991;
Kasischke et al., 1995; Kurz et al., 1995).

"The net primary productivity of boreal forests tends to be
low—commonly 3-8 t (dry matter) ha"") yr!, compared with
7-12 tha:! yr! for northern hardwoods (Cannell, 1982; Melillo
et al., 1993). Productivity is controlled in a complex way by
interactions between various factors as discussed in Section
1.6.4 (Bonan and Shugart, 1989). As a boreal forest stand
develops after fire, litter accumulates, more and more nutrients
are immobilized in the litter, the depth of thaw is reduced
because of the insulating properties of the litter, drainage may
then be impaired by permafrost, and moss growth may impair
regeneration from seed—some of which may be held within
serotinous cones that release their seed only after fire (Bonan,
1992). Fire interrupts this process by burning litter on the for-
est floor, releasing mineral nutrients, leading to deeper thaw,
improving drainage, and often removing the moss layer—all of
which improves conditions for seed germination (Landhausser
and Wein, 1993).

disturbance by fire and insect pests may be more important
agents of change than elevated temperatures and CO, levels per
se (Shugart et al., 1992; Dixon and Krankina, 1993), Overall,
the boreal forest is likely to decrease in area, biomass, and car-
bon stock, with a move toward younger age-classes and consid-
erable disruption at its southern boundary (Neilson et al., 1994;
Kurz et al., 1995). CO, enrichment itself may have less effect
than in warmer climates. In Sections 1.6.4.1 through 1.6.4.4, we
consider the likely changes in the distribution and composition
of the forest and then elaborate on the factors driving change.

"Over the next century, the potential (or preferred) geographic
ranges of species may shift approximately 300-500 km, imply-
ing changes in forest-based industries and considerable
socioeconomic impacts. In the early Holocene (about 8,000
years ago), when the climate became warmer, fire-adapted
hardwood species expanded northward to new sites after fire
(Green, 1987). Where northern deciduous species, such as
sugar maple, migrate northward, forest productivity may be
increased on soils that retain adequate water, whereas produc-
tivity may decrease on dry soils where boreal forest may give
way to oak-pine savanna (Pastor and Post, 1988).

"On its southern border, the boreal forest may give way to north-
ern deciduous forest (or agriculture) in areas with a maritime
influence and to grassland or xerophytic steppe vegetation in
midcontinental areas, and species shifts may occur in the mid-
boreal region (Emanuel et al., 1985; Kellomaki and Kolstrém,
1992; Rizzo and Wiken, 1992; Dixon and Krankina, 1993;
Monserud et al., 1993a; Tchebakova et al., 1994; Prentice and
Sykes, 1995). Near tree lines in many areas, there is potential
for existing populations of suppressed individuals to grow
taller and more vigorously, as has apparently happened in
response to past climatic changes (Kullman, 1986; Payette et
al., 1989a; Hofgaard et al., 1991).

"Increasing temperatures are likely to stimulate soil organic mat-
ter decomposition and increase nutrient (especially nitrogen)
availability, leading to an increase in net primary productivity of
non-stressed stands, averaging perhaps 10% in the boreal zone
in a 2 x CO, climate (Melillo et al., 1993). However, despite
increasing productivity, there may be a net carbon loss from the
ecosystem because a small temperature rise will greatly
enhance decomposition rates (Jenkinson et al., 1991), whereas
CO, fertilization will be of low effectiveness because of low
temperatures (Kirschbaum, 1993). Also, productivity may not
increase in dry areas if water limitations were to increase due to
increased evaporative demand. Hydrological and landscape
changes in the patterns of bogs and forest also may be expect-
ed. In the north, melting of permafrost would favor the expan-
sion of wetlands, while drier conditions in the south would
lower the water tables (Apps ef al., 1993).

"In the forest-tundra, rising temperatures are likely to enhance
the development and germination of seeds of many species,
increasing forest cover and enabling a northward migration to
occur, probably after fire (Kullman, 1990; Kellomaki and
Kolstrém, 1992; Landhdusser and Wein, 1993)—but again,
hampered to some extent by slow changes in soil conditions
(Rizzo and Wiken, 1992). There is clear evidence in the fossil
pollen and macrofossil record of expansion and recession of
boreal forest in both Eurasia and North America in response to
temperature changes over the past 10,000 years (Ritchie,
1987). However, it will take more than 100 years for any new
forest areas to mature in the forest-tundra, so the northward
expansion of mature boreal forest is likely to be slower than the
rate at which it is lost to grassland and temperate deciduous
forest at its southern boundary (Rizzo and Wiken, 1992). The
tundra itself is likely to become a carbon source in response to
warming (Billings et al., 1984; Oechel e¢ al., 1993).
"	Text
"There is concern that the maximum potential migration rates
may be too slow to keep up with the rate of climatic change
(see Sections 1.3.3 and 1.3.5)—in which case some researchers
consider that there may be areas of transitory forest decline,
especially if soils change slowly, are unfavorable for immi-
grating species, and lack necessary microbes and symbionts
(Dixon and Turner, 1991; Davis and Zabinski, 1992; Solomon,
1992; Smith and Shugart, 1993), or where growth by more
southern species is limited by photoperiodic constraints. The
future of the transitory forest is likely to be determined by
increasing occurrence of extended high-intensity wildfires
until a new climate-vegetation-fire equilibrium is established
(Crutzen and Goldammer, 1993), Other researchers suggest
that there may be little forest decline. Intraspecific genetic
diversity will buffer change, and species that are no longer in a
favorable climate will simply grow and regenerate poorly and
be overtaken by invading species either gradually or after dis-
turbance (Malanson et al., 1992; see also Section 1.3.3).

"The productivity of boreal forests—except those at the warmer
and drier edge of their species ranges—is likely to respond
favorably to increases in temperature, as shown by long-term
soil warming experiments and models (van Cleve ef al., 1990;
Melillo ez al., 1993). It has long been known that trees in the
boreal forest exhibit positive relationships between annual
growth-ring widths and summer temperatures (Mikola, 1962)
and between volume growth and number of degree-days
(Kauppi and Posch, 1985; Worrell, 1987). Also, most prove-
nance-transfer studies suggest that some southward movement
of ecotypes to warmer climates promotes their volume growth
(Beuker, 1994; Matyas, 1994). The magnitude of the growth
response will depend on the effect of increased temperatures
on nutrient availability, evapotranspiration, and the frequency
of fires. Subtle interactions may be important. For instance,
Bonan et al, (1990) and Bonan (1992) show how increased
temperatures combined with increased evapotranspiration
could result in a faster build-up of litter and a shallower per-
mafrost zone, but an increased probability of fire. The net
effect could be to reduce nutrient availability except after

"Forest simulation models suggest large shifts in species
composition in boreal forests (Shugart et al., 1992). Large
increases in temperature would cause annual heat sums to
exceed the minimum thresholds for seed production, favoring
the northward spread of species, especially in the forest-tun-
dra zone. On the other hand, reduced winter chilling may dis-
rupt both vegetative growth and reproductive processes of
species at the southern edges of their ranges (Kimmins and
Lavender, 1992).

"Defoliating insects play an important role in boreal forests, and
there are many instances where the proportion of different
boreal tree species is related to the intensity of insect pest out-
breaks. Pests usually are maintained at a low population equi-
librium by a combination of host resistance, natural enemies,
and weather conditions. Any one of these factors could be
affected by climatic change, particularly tree resistance in
response to environmental stress. Once an outbreak exceeds a
certain patch size, it can become self-propagating and can
spread largely independently of weather conditions. Following
climatic warming, it seems very likely that insect outbreaks
will expand northward and that new pest and pathogen prob-
lems will arise (Kurz and Apps, 1993).

"Our capability to assess the likely fate of the world’s forests
under altered climatic conditions has been limited because the
conceptual modeling framework for such an assessment is still
in an early stage of development. It needs to be refined to
improve the understanding of climate change impacts at the fol-
lowing three levels: (1) the ecophysiological responses of trees
to changing climate and CO, concentrations, (2) the relation-
ship between tree growth and transient forest dynamics, and (3)
the influence of changing forest characteristics on the global
carbon balance and hence their feedback to the greenhouse
effect. The predictive power of current modeling approaches
decreases from (1) to (3). A consistent research strategy to over-
come these limitations needs to be accompanied by a monitor-
ing program that can provide appropriate databases for initial-
ization, calibration, validation, and application of the models. In
particular, future work should address the following:

"In Canada over recent years, about | to 2 Mha have burned
each year (Kurz and Apps, 1993), and in Russia, between 1.4
and 10 Mha burned each year between 1971 and 1991 (Dixon
and Krankina, 1993). If fires occur very frequently, late suc-
cessional species become unable to outcompete pioneer
species, which will thereby become more common. A threefold
increase in wildfire frequency in Canada between a high-fire
year (1989) and a reference year (1986) resulted in an 86%
reduction in the net ecosystem carbon sink (Kurz et al., 1992).
However, fires also have a beneficial effect on subsequent
ecosystem function and facilitate regeneration (Landhiusser
and Wein, 1993). Fires may have most impact in the forest-tun-
dra zone; indeed, Payette and Gagnon (1985) conclude that the
modern forest-tundra boundary of northeastern North America
is the result of fires during the last 3,000 years, which were fol-
lowed by lower temperatures that limited forest regeneration.
If future fires were followed by higher temperatures, the fires

"Nitrogen is the nutrient that most limits the productivity of
boreal forests (e.g., van Cleve et al., 1983a, 1983b; Tamm,
1991). The critical factor is the rate at which nitrogen is recy-
cled through the litter—which, as noted earlier, is a function of
both temperature and litter quality (Berg et al., 1993), Species
differ in both their response to nitrogen and their litter quality.
Picea sites in cold locations have forest floors with a high
lignin content, little available nitrogen, and slow decomposi-
tion rates, whereas Betula or Populus sites, especially in
warmer locations, have forest floors with less lignin. Thus,
whereas small increases in temperature will increase rates of
decomposition and nitrogen cycling, large or prolonged tem-
perature increases also will lead to a shift from coniferous to
deciduous tree species, and—because of the greater decom-
posability of deciduous litter—this may have a further positive
effect on nitrogen availability, leading to increased productivi-
ty. On the other hand, increasing CO, concentration could
increase the C:N ratio of litter, and the reduced litter quality
might slow the rate of nutrient cycling (Taylor et al., 1989; van
de Geijn and van Veen, 1993).

"To improve the overall modeling framework for the assessment
of global forest response to climate change, and to provide an
appropriate background for the synthesis of more detailed stud-
ies, there is a requirement for process-based terrestrial biosphere
models of ecosystem dynamics. These models should build on
knowledge from all other levels of model development.
Specifically, they should involve a sufficiently high number of
plant functional types and forest types to cover the wide range of
forests occurring in different climate zones. Various initiatives for
the development of such models are currently underway (e.g.,

through the global network of ground observations

"Rangelands (i.e., grasslands, shrublands, savannas, hot and
cold deserts, and tundra) occupy 51% of the terrestrial land sur-
face, contain about 36% of the world’s total carbon in above
and belowground biomass (Solomon et al., 1993), include a
large number of economically important species and ecotypes,
and sustain millions of people. Rangelands support approxi-
mately 50% of the world’s livestock and provide forage for
both domestic and wildlife populations (Briske and
Heitschmidt, 1991).

"Rangeland vegetation is found where mean precipita-
tion, temperature, elevation, and latitude interact to
provide sites suitable for herbaceous species, shrubs,
and/or open stands of trees. However, carbon cycling,
productivity, and species composition in any region is
directly related to the highly variable amounts and
seasonal distribution of precipitation and is only sec-
ondarily controlled by other climate variables. Small
changes in the frequency of extreme events may have
disproportionate effects on what managers must cope
with in rangeland systems (High Confidence).

CO) increases are likely to result in reductions of for-
age quality and palatability because of increasing car-
bon to nitrogen ratios. These effects will be more
common in lower-latitude rangelands where low
nutritional value is already a chronic problem
(Medium Confidence).
"	List
"Boundaries between rangelands and other biomes are
likely to change with changes of climate: directly,
through climate-driven changes in species composi-
tion, and indirectly, through changes in wildfire
regimes, opportunistic cultivation, or agricultural
release of the less-arid margins of the rangeland terri-
tory. These effects will be more common in the tem-
perate rangelands (High Confidence).

Climatic warming may cause tundra to become a net
source of carbon dioxide. Temperature increases in
the tundra will reduce species richness, especially of
insect-pollinated forbs (Medium Confidence).

The extensive use of rangelands suggests that strate-
gies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions must focus
on maintaining or increasing carbon sequestration
through better soil and vegetation management and
reducing methane by altering animal production sys-
tems (High Confidence).

Human adaptive strategies for coping with climate-
change effects on rangelands include the preservation
of an extensive spatial scale in management units and
the development of viable marketing systems capable
of absorbing opportunistic variations in number and/or
kind and class of animals (Medium Confidence).

Prentice et al., 1992). Rangelands include unimproved

"Rangeland ecosystems are diverse (Table 2-2), and stores of
carbon both above and below ground vary by ecosystem type
(Solomon et al., 1993). Carbon (C) stored in the world’s
rangeland vegetation has been estimated by the BIOME 1.1
model at 749.7 Gt (Solomon et al., 1993), although annual net
primary productivity varies widely (Barbour et al., 1987).
Carbon in the world’s rangeland soils has been estimated at
591.6 Gt, or 44% of the world’s total soil carbon (Solomon et
al., 1993), Preindustrial levels of soil C (to 20 cm depth) in
grasslands alone have been estimated at approximately 96 Gt
(Ojima et al., 1993b). Current soil C stocks for these grasslands
(based on Ojima et al., 1993b) are estimated at 81-164 Gt,

"In rangelands, the amount and timing of precipitation are the
major determinants of community structure and function.
Other driving forces that determine plant community compo-
sition, distribution, and productivity include temperature, fire,
soil type, and herbivory. These driving forces prevent species
senescence and allow for periodic rejuvenation by eliminating
aboveground biomass and organic debris and thereby liberat-
ing nutrients. Most rangelands do not exist in a state of equi-
librium, nor do they exhibit linear successional trends; rather,
they fluctuate from one state to another depending on rain,
fire, grazing, and other anthropogenic factors (Westoby et al.,
1989; Stafford Smith and Pickup, 1993; Hobbs ef al., 1991;
Stafford Smith, 1994). Most rangelands are nonequilibrial

temperature appears to be the major climatic variable controlling
the process of decomposition in grasslands and other rangeland
types (Jenkinson, 1977; Meentemeyer, 1984; Burke et al., 1989).
It has been shown experimentally that decomposition rates
increase rapidly with temperature, provided that there is enough

"processes—increased photosynthesis and reduced transpira-
tion—typically contribute to the positive influence of CO, on
plant WUE. Atmospheric CO, directly affects the coupling
between climatic water balance and vegetation by altering the
efficiency with which plants use water. The effect of CO, on
water use may be more important in water-limited rangelands
than in moist grassland systems or irrigated agricultural land.
Elevated CO, can result in a slower depletion of soil water in
drought-stricken rangeland grasses where there is no change in
leaf area due to limitations such as nitrogen availability

response to elevated CO, can be difficult to predict because of
the feedback between litter quality, soil, and plant production
(Schimel et al., 1991; Bazzaz and McConnaughay, 1992;
Ojima et al., 1993b; Newton et al., 1995). In natural ecosys-

"Most research on rangeland plant response to elevated CO, has
focused on responses of individual plants (Bazzaz and
McConnaughay, 1992; Idso and Idso, 1994). A wide range of plant
parameters have been measured (see Chapter A), and as a rule,
studies show that increasing CO, levels increase photosynthesis,
water-use efficiency (WUE), above- and belowground productiv-
ity, and nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) and decrease stomatal con-
ductance, transpiration, and whole-plant respiration (Wong et al.,
1979; Kimball, 1983; Webb et al., 1983; Strain and Cure, 1985;
Morison, 1987; Smith et al., 1987; Idso, 1989; Bazzaz, 1990;

et al., 1993; Rozema et al., 1993; Zak et al., 1993; Gifford, 1994;
Idso and Idso, 1994; Rogers et al., 1994). For example, controlled-
environment studies have repeatedly demonstrated that growth
and net photosynthesis of C; plants, including woody species such
as Prosopsis glandulosa (Polley et al., 1994), are highly respon-
sive to CO, when it is increased over concentrations representative
of the recent and prehistoric past (Gifford, 1977; Baker et al.,

Reduced nitrogen concentrations may reduce the rate of

to be more responsive to CO, than are C, ones (see Chapter
A). This effect is not always sustained at the community
level, however. For example, Owensby et al. (1993) report
that production of a C,-dominated tallgrass prairie increased
when exposed to elevated CO,, apparently as a result of
higher water-use efficiency, but other studies have detected
no effect on production, flowering, or growth rates (Polley
et al., 1994; Korner and Miglietta, 1994). Data from grass-

"Grazing and browsing by domestic and wild animals, including
invertebrates, alters the appearance, productivity, and composi-

The role of herbivory and subsequent impacts on rangeland
structure and function depends in part on the evolutionary histo-

Herbivory is a disturbance whether the ecosystem has a short

largely a function of intake (generally about 80% of the vari-

increasing intake is likely to dominate the impacts of increased
feed quality. However, in rangelands where feed quality is low,

"Many of the factors that influence nitrogen gas emissions also
influence net methane emissions, but the influences are not
necessarily in the same direction. Conversion of forests to pas-
tures, fertilization, and, probably, nitrogen deposition decrease
soil methane consumption (Mosier et al., 1991; Keller et al.,
1993; Ojima et al., 1993a). Any factor that enhances primary
productivity, such as elevated CO, N deposition, or fertiliza-
tion, is likely to increase methane emissions because methane
production is limited by substrate availability (Whiting and
Chanton, 1993; Dacey et al., 1994; Valentine et al., 1994; King
and Schnell, 1994; Hutsch et al., 1995). The possible extent of
this enhancement is not yet clear. On the other hand, factors
that decrease primary production (and thus CO, uptake) or pH,
like ozone and acid rain, could have the opposite effect (Yavitt
et al., 1993).

"A number of factors influence CH,, NO, and N,O emissions
from rangeland ecosystems: deposition of nitrogen, nitrogen
fertilization, changing climate, elevated CO,, ozone influences
on plant production, changing plant community composition,
changing animal populations, and changing land use (Schimel et
al,, 1990, 1991; Ojima et al., 1993a; Parton et al., 1994), Many
of these factors are likely to respond non-linearly to climate
changes. Changing precipitation and temperature directly affect
the production of both NO and N,O by regulating microbial
activity (Firestone and Davidson, 1989). With abundant sub-
strate, increasing temperatures generally increase rates of pro-
duction, but changing soil moisture could decrease the rates of
production. With no change in diet, more animals would result
in greater NO production (Bouwman et al., 1995). However, all
of the other factors listed are likely to change emissions through
regulation of the nitrogen cycle. The greatest increase in emis-
sions will occur when nitrogen supply exceeds plant demand,
because this directly increases the nitrogenous substrates avail-
able for volatilization and leaching.

these and other factors on rangelands have illustrated the
tremendous influence such interactions have on these systems

competitive advantage in a moderately grazed system are gen-

excessive herbivory has been shown to favor unpalatable
woody species over graminoids (Archer, 1994), Examples are

role in maintaining grasslands, meadows, and savannas, and
they can change closed woodland, thickets, or heathland into
open, grass-dominated systems (Sinclair and Norton-Griffiths,

"Climate change and CO, may also interact with grazing effects.
Drought favors the concentration of herbivores at sites with
more reliable water supply and hence leads to overgrazing in
these locations (Heitschmidt and Stuth, 1991; Heady and
Childs, 1994). Increasing CO, will likely result in lower forage
quality because of higher C:N ratios and higher concentration
of unpalatable and/or toxic compounds in plants (Fajer et al.
1989, 1991; Johnson and Lincoln, 1991). Forage consumption
may increase up to a point as a result, because herbivores will
need to eat more to meet nutritional demands (Fajer et al.,
1991)—although the loss of palatability may reduce grazing
pressure on certain species. At present, it is possible to say only
that the overall carrying capacity for herbivores may increase,
decrease, or remain constant, depending on the balance
between eventual increases in productivity and decreases in
nutritional value.

“regressive management” scenario (i.e., removal of 50% of the
aboveground biomass during grazed months) and a “sustain-
able” scenario [i.e., using moderate grazing and burning
regimes as specified by Ojima et al. (1993b)]. The impact of
“regressive” land management resulted in a loss of soil C in all
regions after 50 years, with the largest losses in the warm grass-
lands. The total net loss relative to current condition was pro-
jected at 10.8 Gt. When this regressive management is com-

"Scale is a particularly important issue in rangelands because of
the very large size of management units, which is often caused
by low productivity. Thus, rangeland management units incor-
porate spatial heterogeneity, instead of partitioning it as is usu-
ally the case in more intensive agricultural systems (Stafford
Smith and Pickup, 1993). Most grasslands and rangelands are
in climatic regions that are subject to frequent alterations in
essential resource availability. The superimposition of manage-
ment practices such as fire and grazing adds further variation
in resource availability over time. Rangelands are character-
ized by more complex structure and function than other biomes
because controlling factors (i.e., precipitation, energy, nutri-
ents) often fluctuate rapidly over short time periods (Seastedt
and Knapp, 1993). This variability in ecosystem behavior will
lead to complex responses to global change.

"Major shifts in climate—from relatively wet periods to dry periods or droughts—are common in the rangelands of Africa.
Long-term rainfall records and other evidence from Africa’s rangeland areas show that shifting climate dynamics have
prevailed there for at least the last 10,000 years (Nicholson, 1983; Hulme, 1990). Traditional African livestock husbandry
practices have been greatly influenced by the highly variable environment (Ellis and Swift, 1988; Behnke et al., 1993;
Ellis and Galvin, 1994). Because the economy depends directly and indirectly on livestock products, pastoralists have
developed multiple coping mechanisms. Pastoralists cope with climate variability by keeping diverse species of livestock,
by temporary emigration, by maintaining economic diversity, and even by allocating seasonal and drought-induced nutri-
tional stress among stronger community members (Coughenour et al., 1985; Galvin, 1992; Galvin et al., 1994). This sys-
tem requires extensive land area and external markets.

"The pastoralists’ stabilizing strategies have become constrained in this century primarily as a result of an increasing
human population in conjunction with stable or declining livestock populations and decreasing land area. Although much
recent literature suggests that livestock populations are on the increase, abundant data for the arid and semi-arid zones
show otherwise. East African pastoralists have been unable to expand livestock holdings due to such factors as disease
epidemics, recurring droughts, and intertribal raiding (Sandford, 1983; Homewood and Rodgers, 1984; O’ Leary, 1984;
Arhem, 1985; Sperling, 1987; McCabe, 1990). In addition, dry-season ranges with more reliable water supply have been
lost to colonial and African agriculturalists, to game parks, and to game conservation areas (Campbell, 1984; Bekure et
al., 1987; Homewood et al., 1987; Little, 1987). Pastoralists also have taken up agriculture in an effort to meet their
increasing food demands. Thus, with increasing population pressure on a declining resource base, there is an expanding
reliance on the marketing of animals. However, African livestock market infrastructure and stability is still in an early
stage of development.

the United States, for example, changed plant production systems

modification of land surface characteristics. Weaver and Albertson
(1944) showed that the distribution of grasslands changed in the
United States, with the shortgrass species moving eastward into
the midgrass prairie and midgrass species moving eastward into
the tallgrass prairie. In addition, these grasslands were invaded by

changes in the frequency of extreme events may have a dis-

these systems. For example, the structure of long-lived peren-

extremes increases significantly, because seedling establish-

extremes (Graetz et al., 1988), Both the stability of forage

"Boundaries among rangeland vegetation types and between
rangeland systems and other biomes are likely to change with
changes in climate. Shifting boundaries between plant com-

will be determined by the nature of climate change, including
the frequency and severity of extreme events. As nonequilib-

there probably will not be any synchronized movement of
entire vegetation belts. Land-use change and human interven-

directly from human activity (Parton et al., 1994), According
to Burke et al. (1990), the impact of a 2 x CO,-driven climate-
change scenario on grassland soil C levels in the southern
Great Plains would be an order of magnitude smaller than the
impact of plowing the grassland for crop production. Mosier et
al. (1991) have shown that plowing and fertilization of grass-
lands increases N,O flux by 50% and decreases soil sink
strength for CH, by 50%. These impacts, too, are much larger
than the potential effects of a 2 x CO,-driven climate change
(Burke et al., 1990). While the effects of plowing on soil car-
bon and trace-gas fluxes may be large on a regional basis, the
impact of CO, and climate may be similar on a global average.
The effects of climate and land-use changes combined could
lead to more rapid changes than either would alone.

Second, soil erosion rates may increase as plant cover decreas-

Finally, the above transitions are almost always exacerbated by
intense human land use, as occurs in most temperate grassland

Degradation can thus occur through both functional (e.g.,

broad-leafed trees of the genera Brachystegia and Julbernadia as dominants. Herbivory by large mammals consumes a
relatively small fraction of total primary production (5-10%) due to high concentrations of secondary compounds (main-
ly tannins) and low nitrogen concentrations in the foliage of the woody plants; thus, there is a high fire-fuel load and a
short (1-3 year) fire interval. Dry savanna is dominated by fine-leafed trees (mainly Acacia) and stoloniferous grasses
(Scholes and Walker, 1993). Large mammal herbivory is high (10-50% of total primary production), the fuel load is low,
and the inter-fire interval is relatively long (5+ years).

"Probable biological impacts of climate change: These grasslands are vulnerable to drought. IPCC climate scenarios
(Greco et al., 1994) suggest that mean annual winter (JJA) temperatures may increase 0.5 to 1°C, while mean annual
summer (DJF) temperatures may increase as much as 2°C. Generally summer (DJF) precipitation is expected to decline
from 0-40% by the year 2050, while winter (JJA) precipitation may increase or decrease +20% in the region (Greco et
al., 1994). If these projections are correct, the crop and animal production for the region could drop drastically. During
the 1920s and 1930s, extremely dry conditions caused a shift of agriculture to the east, and the abandoned agricultural
land eroded, with the loss of 60,000 km? of arable land (Suriano e¢ al., 1992). Unusually dry summers may bring about
some long-lasting changes in community structure (Chaneton et al., 1988; Sala, in Soriano, 1992). The projected changes
may allow C, species to develop earlier in the season, while decreased summer precipitation will likely favor C, species.

"Probable biological impacts of climate change: The major predicted impact is an increase in the frequency and severi-
ty.of drought (McKeon et al., 1993). An increase in the frequency of drought is likely to lead to episodic die-offs of
woody vegetation. This will increase the fire-fuel load and thus potentially increase the frequency and intensity of fires.
The greatest impacts are likely to be in the semi-arid savannas, where human populations depend mainly on pastoralism
(see Box 2-1). Human responses are likely to include increasing the distribution and security of surface water for live-
stock. This is likely to further weaken the grass layer, with acceleration of desertification. One strategy to bolster the pro-
duction of animal protein would be to promote the sustainable use and management of indigenous herbivore species,
especially preferential browsers (giraffe, eland, kudu, impala, etc.), many of which are independent of surface water and
largely do not compete with domestic grazers.

"Some probable biological impacts of climate change: There are a number of possible vegetation changes that could
occur as a result of IPCC climate-change scenarios. An increase in precipitation during the growing season may increase
the proportion of grasses and forbs over woody plants, which may increase the potential for more frequent fires, further
favoring grasses. Cold conditions with increased precipitation during the winter will likely favor drought-tolerant woody
species (e.g., Artemisia sp.) over herbaceous species. These conditions would also decrease fire frequency, thereby bene-
fiting woody plants over grasses and forbs. Mild, wet winters and dry summers may enhance the spread and dominance
of introduced Eurasian annuals such as cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) and Russian thistle (Salsola kali). Cheatgrass is a
fire-prone species, and previous work has demonstrated that frequent fire-return intervals occur with cheatgrass domi-
nance (Whisenant, 1990). A decrease in total annual precipitation will likely result in shrub steppe communities shifting
toward desert shrub.

"Changing the mix of animals. Changing the mix of animals on
a given rangeland area can increase carbon storage and
decrease methane emissions, but the benefit derived depends
on the kind of rangeland and the proposed mix of animals. If a
country is considering only cattle and small stock (sheep,
goats, etc.), the mix may not be ecologically efficient; rather, it
may reflect an economic risk aversion—in bad times, cattle die
but goats survive. In this kind of grazing mix, the ecosystem
may deteriorate. In contrast, a mix of cattle and wildlife rumi-
nants may be both ecologically and economically efficient.
"	Text
"Changing animal distribution. Changing animal distribution
through salt placement, development of water sources, or fenc-
ing can increase carbon sequestration through small increases
in plant cover overall and improved status of the root system
(due to less intense grazing). None of the changes in animal
distribution, however, is expected to affect methane produc-
tion. Animal-management practices will be specific to local
and regional production systems; for example, fencing and/or
placement of salt may not be useful in herding systems and
may potentially interfere with wildlife migration. Costs and
practices will vary widely by region.
"	Text
"Carbon storage in grasslands, savannas, and deserts is primarily
below ground (Table 2-2). Estimates using the BIOME model
(Solomon et al., 1993) suggest that in the world’s rangelands
approximately 595 Gt C is stored in belowground biomass (44%
of the world’s total), while only about 158 Gt is stored in range-
land aboveground biomass. Thus, good soil management is the
key to keeping or increasing C storage and protecting rangeland
health (condition). Improving rangeland health, and thus the
amount and kind of vegetation, will also reduce methane emis-
sion from ruminant animals per unit product by improving the
quality of their diet. Total methane emissions from the grazing
system will decrease only if there are commensurate reductions
in animal numbers in the less-resilient parts of the grazing land-
scape however (Howden et al., 1994).
"	Text
"Nonsustainable land-use practices such as inappropriate plow-
ing, overgrazing by domestic animals, and excessive fuelwood
use are root causes of degradation of rangeland ecosystems
(Ojima et al., 1993b; Sampson et al., 1993). Some systems
may already be degraded to such an extent that the ability of
the ecosystem to recover under better management practices
will be greatly hampered. Practices listed in Table 2-5 may
prove to be useful in GHG mitigation. None of the practices is
relevant for every country, social system, or rangeland type.
Unfortunately, because of the high dependence of rangeland
function on adequate amounts and timing of rainfall, none of
these practices is likely to significantly improve rangeland
function and carbon sequestration without adequate rainfall
(Heady, 1988; McKeon et al., 1989).

"forage systems (Riveros, 1993). Legume species generally
show larger yield responses to elevated CO, than do grasses at
warm temperatures and also show enhanced nitrogen-fixation
rates (Crush et al., 1993; Newton et al., 1994; Campbell et al.,
1995a). The benefits of leguminous species could be offset to
some extent by future increases in damaging UV-B radiation
(Caldwell et al., 1989), because legumes may be quite suscep-
tible to UV-B relative to other species (Krupa and Kickert,
1989; Brown, 1994). However, the effects are uncertain at pre-
sent because there are only limited experimental data available
on the effects of future UV-B radiation levels on forage and
rangeland legumes.

In some grass-dominated rangeland systems, improved pas-
tures may help people to adapt livestock grazing strategies. In
these systems, there is significant intervention—including
selection of forage type, selective animal breeding, pasture
renewal, irrigation, and other practices (Campbell and Stafford
Smith, 1993). This intervention provides opportunities for gra-
ziers to adapt systems so they are protected against negative
effects of global change and so that any potential benefits are
realized. McKeon et al. (1993) developed a scheme for adapt-
ing rangelands to climate change by linking management deci-
sions to climate variability.

"Table 2-5: Practices (mitigation options) to improve rangeland condition or health, and to reduce GHG emissions on range-
lands. Possible effects of implementing each practice are listed for two greenhouse gases, and qualitative cost/benefits esti-
mates are provided. Unhealthy, poor-condition rangelands are those lands where soil loss, plant species and cover loss,
species invasions, and interrupted and poorly functioning nutrient cycling are the norm. Good condition, healthy rangelands,
on the other hand, have nutrient cycling and energy flows intact; soils are not eroding; and plant species composition and pro-
ductivity is indicative of a functioning ecosystem (NRC, 1994).

ary changes (especially C,/C,, shrub/grass boundaries), as well
as fire, herbivory, and land-use affects on rangeland productivi-
ty and diversity. Along with monitoring, there needs to be an
ongoing analysis of the results and review of monitoring meth-
ods and criteria.
"	Text
"Using the practices in Table 2-5 requires the recognition that
productivity on rangelands is variable and that vegetation and
animal response to changes in livestock numbers is not linear.
Futhermore, there are system lags, and management activities
may result in largely irreversible changes in the rangeland sys-
tem. Risk-management strategies include long-term low stock-
ing or changing animal numbers annually to track variation in
precipitation (McKeon ef al., 1993). Either approach requires
flexible management response to different events, opportuni-
ties, and hazards and whole-system analyses in which the inter-
actions of climate, land management, fire, and plant and animal
species and communities will determine the outcome.
"	Text
"Although rangelands have been used historically for livestock
production for meat, wool, hides, milk, blood, and/or pharma-
ceuticals, policymakers must realize that an equally important
objective for maintaining rangelands may be to maximize the
number of domestic animals as a social resource (e.g., in some
tribal cultures, wives are bought with livestock), Rangelands
also are increasingly affected by human activities for mineral
production, construction materials, fuel, and chemicals.
Additionally, rangelands provide habitat for wildlife, threat-
ened and endangered species, anthropological sites, eco-
tourism, and recreational activities. As the human population
grows, rangelands also incur increased demand for marginal
agriculture production. All of these activities and uses poten-
tially affect rangeland condition—and thus the potential of the
ecosystem to sequester carbon.

"Human-induced desertification has the potential to counteract
any ameliorating effect of climate change on most deserts
unless appropriate management actions are taken.
"	Text
"In a few places (e.g., central Australia) conditions may
improve, but any net change in rainfall—thus the veg-
etation—will depend largely on the human manage-
ment of these regions (Low Confidence).
Opportunities to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in
desert regions are few (High Confidence).

"Deserts are an environmental extreme. The biota in deserts are at
the limit of conditions that allow growth and survival and show

"Most deserts are likely to become even more extreme
if climate changes as projected by current scenarios;
most desert regions are expected to become hotter and
most will probably not become significantly wetter
(Medium Confidence).

If changes in the frequency or intensity of the rainfall
events occur, they are likely to cause changes in the
flora and fauna. Higher atmospheric CO, concentra-
tions and more intense rainfall events may lead to the
opportunity for greater invasion of desert systems,
particularly by C; plants. More frequent large pulses
of rain will allow ephemeral organisms to reproduce
more often. Any reduction in the intensity of the rain-
fall, however, could also be detrimental to this set of
organisms due to false starts in their life cycles
(Medium Confidence).

"Approximately 30% of the globe’s land surface is desert or
semi-desert, with almost 5% receiving less than 70 mm annual
rainfall, 11% less than 100 mm, and 18% less than 120 mm
(Shmida, 1985; Le Houerou, 1992). Some of the extremely arid
deserts are shown in Figure 3-1. Human population estimates

"Deserts are characterized by low rainfall that is highly variable
both intra- and interannually. Desert air is very dry, and incom-
ing solar and outgoing terrestrial radiation are intense. Large
daily temperature fluctuations occur (ca. 30°C), and potential
evapotranspiration is high. There is high spatial and temporal
variability in desert biota, driven largely by water availability
(Noy Meir, 1985).

"on the extremely arid regions; Chapter 2 deals with most
aspects of arid and semi-arid regions. The permanent biota in
extremely arid regions have specialized adaptations to cope
with the harsh environment—sometimes obtaining their mois-
ture from fog or dew. There also are ephemeral biota that
migrate into desert regions or become active from drought-
resistant seeds or dormant life stages, to take advantage of the
rare rainfall events. Thus, extreme deserts have very distinctive
characteristics.

"Desert environments arise in several circumstances. Most
deserts occur between 20° and 40° latitude, where persistent
high-pressure cells bring dry air to the Earth’s surface (see
Figure 2-2 in Chapter 2). However, the climate depends on the
precise balance between this air mass and topography, conti-
nentality, and sea currents (Evenari, 1985a). Some deserts are
in the rain shadows of major mountain ranges (e.g., the
Atacama desert of South America; see also Chapter 5). Others
are a great distance from a source of oceanic moisture or are
more-or-less continuously swept by winds that have traveled a
great distance over land (e.g., the central Asian deserts).

"The hottest deserts of the world (e.g., central Sahara, Namib)
have average monthly temperatures above 30°C during the
warmest months, with extremes above 50°C. The diurnal range
often is very high, with nights as cold as 10°C. High insolation
loads mean that soil surface temperatures often rise to more
than 80°C (Cloudsley-Thompson, 1977).

"Some high continental deserts have extremely cold winters;
e.g., the Chihuahuan Desert in North America has average
monthly minimum temperatures below freezing (MacMahon
and Wagner, 1985). Cold conditions prevent effective growth
of plants in winter; however, snow or moisture often accumu-
lates and can contribute to growth in the warmer months.

"Precipitation, soils, and temperature all contribute to the nature
of desert ecosystems. Vegetation is largely a function of rain-
fall modified by soil type (in particular, the coarseness of the
soil; Bertiller et al., 1995) because these two factors determine
potential soil moisture and water-holding capacity. Higher tem-
peratures usually imply higher vapor-pressure deficits (evapo-
trative demands) and thus higher evaporation and transpiration
losses.
"	Text
"Correlative studies show that the diversity and density of some
animal groups are related to vegetation productivity gradients,
precipitation, and potential and actual evapotranspiration
(Clark, 1980; Maurer, 1985; Owen, 1988; Currie, 1991;
Hoffman et al., 1994; Specht and Specht, 1994). However, the
links are complex—depending on the taxonomic group, sea-
sonality of precipitation, frequency of droughts, and the scale
at which diversity and density are measured. Thus, changes in
animal populations in response to changes in climate are very
difficult to predict.

"The availability of moisture at and near the soil surface is
critical for the activity of desert organisms. The water avail-
able to plants is dependent on the balance between input from
precipitation and losses from direct evaporation from the soil
surface, transpiration through the leaf-root systems of plants,
and drainage below the root zone. Thus, the effectiveness of
a given amount of rain is dependent on how far it infiltrates
below the surface; greater penetration reduces evaporative
Josses. More-intense rainfall events tend to penetrate less and
create more. runoff than less-intense events. In contrast to
most other arid ecosystems, the sandy soils of extreme deserts

richness)—is moderately high in semi-arid regions and

example, Aronson and Shmida (1992) found that plant species
richness fell linearly from 116 species at a site with 280 mm
mean annual rainfall to 15 species at a site with about 30 mm

"Although deserts are not as diverse as some biomes, they have
significant diversity—with many groups of organisms and
often a high degree of endemism (Le Houerou, 1992). Taxa
that are diverse relative to other biomes include predatory
arthropods, ants, termites, snakes, lizards, migratory birds, suc-
culents, and annual plants (McGinnies et al., 1968; Huenneke
and Noble, 1995). There is substantial variation in the richness
of particular taxa among the deserts of different continental
areas (Evenari, 1985b; Huenneke and Noble, 1995). Desert
biota are unusual in the frequency with which particular mor-
phological or physiological adaptations have evolved indepen-
dently in different taxonomic groups (Cloudsley-Thompson,
1993). For example, many animals and plants have thick skins
or cuticles to reduce water loss; other have hairs or spines to
reflect radiation.

"Average aboveground net primary productivity in areas with
annual precipitation of <250 mm varies from almost 0 to about
2000 kg/ha/yr (Evenari et al., 1971; Noy Meir, 1973; Hadley
and Szarek, 1981; Webb et al., 1983; Le Houerou, 1984). Most
productivity estimates are for aboveground vegetation only;
there is very little information on belowground plant produc-
tivity. Root to shoot ratios differ greatly among desert life
forms (Noy Meir, 1973). Ephemeral species often have rela-
tively small root systems (root:shoot < 0.5), whereas some
perennials have large belowground storage systems with
root:shoot ratios as high as 20. Productivity is directly related
to rainfall, often by a simple linear function. Alternatively, it
can be expressed as a close relationship with actual evapotran-
spiration because actual evapotranspiration is closely related to
rainfall (Branson et al., 1981). Estimates of water-use efficien-
cy by desert plants vary from 0.3 to 2.0 mg dry matter pro-
duced per gram of water transpired, with a threshold of 25 to
170 mm of annual rainfall to sustain any vegetation at all (Noy

"If, under climate change, the duration of periods of moist con-

species may be disadvantaged. They will be triggered into
responding more frequently but will often fail to complete their
life cycle in the shorter moist periods (Frasier et al., 1985,
1987). For example, ephemeral plants could be triggered into
germinating but not have time to set seeds before drying out,
thus depleting their seed bank.

"The main sources of nitrogen in deserts are N-fixing organisms
on the soil surface such as lichens, cyanobacteria, moss, and
fungi. Atmospheric deposition is an important source in some
areas. Nitrogen fixation inputs in arid regions of the United
States are 25 to 40 kg N/ha/yr (West and Skujins, 1977; Rundel
et al., 1982), whereas atmospheric deposition is estimated to be
3 kg N/ha/yr (Peterjohn and Schlesinger, 1990). Assimilation
of nitrogen from fog is sometimes considered to be a signifi-
cant source of N, but Evans and Ehleringer (1994) found that
this is not the case in the fog zones of the Atacama Desert.

"Most desert organisms are adapted to one of two survival mech-
anisms (see Noy Meir, 1973). Some survive in a dormant state
between rainfall pulses and take quick advantage of the brief
respites. Typical examples are the ephemeral plants, but certain
species of crustacea, molluscs, and frogs use similar strategies
(Williams and Calaby, 1985). Other organisms—such as peren-
nial plants, reptiles, and some mammals—persist through the
dry conditions because they have extremely efficient water and
energy conservation strategies (Williams and Calaby, 1985).
Some smaller plants and animals are able to persist on the mois-
ture settling as dew or fog (Louw and Seely, 1982).

"Fog and dew can each contribute 30 mm or more of moisture
per year. Dew can form on more than half the nights of a year
in some deserts (Seely, 1979). Thus, fog and dew are an impor-.
tant and relatively reliable source of water for plants and ani-
mals alike (e.g., Namib beetles and lizards; Louw and Seely,
1982). In some of the driest coastal deserts (e.g., Atacama or
Peruvian deserts), fogs are particularly frequent and provide
the majority if not all of the moisture in most years (Rauh,
1985), Alwelaie et al. (1993) have suggested that the shrub-
dominated vegetation in a desert island in the Red Sea depends
on fog for its water supply.

"Biological activity in most ecosystems is controlled by the
availability of light, water, and nutrients. Complex interactions
and feedbacks have developed that govern the growth and
development of organisms in these systems. In contrast, desert
ecosystems are dominated by rainfall events. Rainfall is infre-
quent, usually highly unpredictable, and often provides moist
conditions for only a short period. Deserts have been described
as pulse-driven ecosystems (Noy Meir, 1973), This means that
the response of desert ecosystems to climate change may be
different than that of other systems, where more complex feed-
~ backs and interactions have developed.

evapotranspiration by 0.2 to 2 mm per day (Mabbutt, 1989;

temperatures and higher surface and soil evaporation rates,
although the direct effects of higher CO, concentrations may

"Soil nitrogen is unevenly distributed in arid environments and
is usually higher in surface soil and beneath larger plants or
shrubs than in bare areas (Charley and West, 1977). Most nitro-
gen fixation occurs near the soil surface, and species that take
up most of their water from the surface zone might be at an
advantage over deeper-rooted species. However, Evans and
Ehleringer (1994) found that this is not the case for deep-root-
ed Chrysothamnus nauseosus individuals compared with neigh-
boring shallow-rooted species. They conclude that water deep

"The coefficient of annual variation (standard deviation/mean)
increases rapidly as mean annual rainfall falls from 300 to 100
mm per year; for sites with 100 mm annual rainfall, the stan-
dard deviation can be 0.65 or higher (MacMahon and Wagner,
1985; Fisher, 1994). This means that at sites with 100 mm/yr
average rainfall, one year in six will have less than 35 mm of
rain. Thus, extreme desert systems already experience wide
fluctuations in rainfall and are adapted to coping with
sequences of extreme conditions. Initial changes associated
with climate change are less likely to create conditions signif-
icantly outside the present range of variation.

"The Greco et al. (1994) scenarios indicate that while some
desert regions will receive more rainfall than at present, most
will remain extremely arid. In most deserts the predicted addi-
tional rainfall is at most only a few centimeters per year, with
some models predicting a decrease in many areas. Decreased
rainfall is predicted for large parts of the Sahara, northern
Arabian, Sonoran, and central and western Asian deserts.
Rainfall in the Chihuahuan, southern Arabian, and Atacama
deserts is predicted to increase slightly or remain the same,
while some of the arid regions of central Australia are predict-
ed to have significant increases in precipitation. The prediction
of increased rainfall in Australian desert regions based on the
Greco et al. (1994) scenarios is contradicted, however, by a
general circulation model (GCM) developed by CSIRO in
Australia (Whetton et al., 1994), In an alternative approach,
Wigley et al. (1980) used past warm-weather periods as an indi-
cator of changes in precipitation under global warming. They
conclude that precipitation in the arid and desert portions of the
United States would decrease under a warmer climate scenario.

"Nasrallah and Balling (1993) found an average 0.07°C increase
per decade in temperature records for the Middle East from
1945-90 with the greatest increases in spring and the smallest
in winter. This increase appears to have been slowed by sulfate
emissions and increased by human-induced desertification.
Miihlenbruch-Tegen (1992) found no evidence of changes in
mean daily temperatures during the past 50 years in South
Africa but did find changes in daily minimum and maximum
temperatures. These could be accounted for by changes in
cloudiness. For example, increased cloud cover may decrease
maximum temperatures and increase minimum temperatures
by reducing insolation during the day and long-wave reradia-
tion at night. Lane et al. (1994) found that from 1901-87, mean
annual temperatures increased by 0.12°C per decade in the
desert southwest region of the United States, but they could not
separate an anthropogenic component from natural variability.
Changes in land-use practices can affect surface temperatures.
Balling (1988) has suggested that an observed 2.5°C tempera-
ture difference across the Mexican/U.S. boundary in the
Sonoran desert may be due largely to heavier grazing on the
Mexican side, which has led to lower vegetation cover and
higher albedo.

runoff patterns. However, their model shows that this process
is slow (ca. 400 yr) in desert regions. Fossil aquifers are impor-

"In the gregarious phase, adult swarms can fly for many days
and cover several hundred kilometers, especially in favorable
wind conditions (Uvarov, 1977; Pedgley, 1989). Gentle winds
allow locusts to take advantage of moist conditions in widely
dispersed areas. The most common breeding sites have been
recorded during the hot season in the Sahel-Sahara region
(Uvarov, 1977). This area has an average annual precipitation
of 50-200 mm, and the lush ephemeral vegetation supported
by run-on in the wadi systems provides a suitable food source
as well as areas suitable for egg-laying.

"A landscape mosaic of runoff and run-on areas is an important
component of desert systems. In some deserts with gently slop-
ing surfaces (<0.6°), narrow bands of vegetation (‘‘stripes’’)
develop. These bands trap the runoff from wider bands of
almost-bare surface upslope of them (White, 1971). At a larg-
er scale, arid lands often are a mosaic of erosion cells, each
consisting of erosional, transfer, and sink areas (Pickup, 1985).
The sink areas receive the benefits of most of the precipitation
falling on the entire cell and accumulate many of the surface
nutrients. Both of these situations will amplify any change in
runoff pattems (Noble and Burke, 1995).

"Scattered permanent and ephemeral waters are important for
migrating and breeding birds. More than 300,000 birds can

after a major rainfall event that floods the lake— an event that
has occurred only four times in the last 100 years. A population
of thousands of egrets has been recorded in ephemeral waters
following torrential rainfall in the Peruvian coastal deserts
(Caviedes, 1984). Ephemeral water bodies can thus be very
important to wetland birds (Kingsford and Porter, 1992) in dif-
ferent desert systems. However, very little is known about the

"The desert locust has a wide distribution in Africa and south-
western Asia, extending over areas with a mean annual pre-

various widely distributed plagues recorded this century
(Uvarov, 1977; Pedgley, 1989) that have caused enormous
damage. For successful breeding, locusts need warm and
moist conditions (Pedgley, 1989); warmer temperatures also
hasten their life cycle. Locusts favor ephemeral systems with
silty or clayey soil that allows the eggs to survive and provides
enough vegetation for the later life stages. However, to reach
plague levels they also require meteorological and vegetation
conditions that bring previously scattered populations togeth-
er, allowing them to continue breeding while avoiding natural
enemies. Scattered pockets of ephemeral, green vegetation
appear to be most suitable.

"Catchment-scale runoff is difficult to predict. An empirical
study that predicted catchment-scale runoff from precipitation
and temperature suggests that runoff will decrease in arid
watersheds in the western United States (Revelle and

the effect could be reversed if changes in water-use efficiency
under increased CO, concentrations were taken into account.
Skiles and Hanson (1994) used a more detailed ecosystem
model to take into account the seasonal responses of vegetation
and found that there was little change, or a decrease, in runoff
in simulated semi-arid watersheds. Morassutti (1992) con-
cludes that runoff from three major drainage basins in
Australia, including the arid Lake Eyre drainage basin, would
increase under scenarios based on the GISS GCM. However,
he warns that there are a number of shortcomings in the model
and that no trends in precipitation and runoff are discernible
from the historical record.

arise through modified land-use and grazing management prac-
tices (see Chapter 2).

"There is a lack of information on many aspects of the extreme
deserts. The highly pulsed availability of resources and the
ephemeral nature of much of the biological activity make them
difficult to study. Predictions of the impacts of climate change
will depend critically on the precise changes in the seasonality
and distribution of rainfall events as much as on the absolute
amounts of rainfall.
"	Text
"Monserud ef al.’s (1993) projection of global vegetation
changes in response to a doubled CO,-driven climate indicates
relatively little change in their desert category (by their defini-
tion, about 25% of land surface and thus close to the generally
accepted desert and semi-deserts). They found that 82-92% of
existing deserts remain so classified under any of the four
GCM climates they used. For all vegetation types combined,
only 59-66% remain in the same category; deserts were the
most stable of the 16 vegetation types they considered.

"Climate amelioration may lead to increased invasion by species
able to disperse widely and possibly to increased fire frequency
if the occurrence of ephemeral flora becomes more common.
Long-range dispersal mechanisms tend to be rare in plants of
the extreme deserts (Ellner and Shmida, 1981; Chambers and
MacMahon, 1994). Thus, even if deserts with little plant cover
(e.g., the central Sahara) were to become more moist, vegeta-
tion may take a long time to respond. In some cases, as in
Australia, species (especially birds) that are dependent on
ephemeral water bodies may show a population increase.
"	Text
"Desert regions are known to have undergone significant
changes in the past. For example, the northern Sahara changed
from Mediterranean flora at about 10,000 yr BP to its present
aridity over several thousand years (Evenari, 1985a). Historical
records show little shift in desert climates more recently,
although vegetation at the margins of desert regions responds
dramatically to variations in seasonal rainfall (Tucker e¢ al.,
1991). There has also been massive change in some areas due
to human activity (see Chapter 4). Long-term studies of desert
communities show that they are highly responsive to small
changes in the climate regime in which they grow, and in par-
ticular to rare events such as unusually moist or dry periods
(Hall et al., 1964, Noble, 1977; Noble and Crisp, 1980;
Goldberg and Turner, 1986; Turner, 1990).

"It has been shown that the E] Nifio Southern Oscillation
(ENSO) phenomenon has a wide-ranging effect on regional cli-
mates that varies with latitude (Caviedes, 1984). Because major
desert areas are driven by anticyclone systems, changes in sea
surface temperature have repercussions for the moisture bud-
gets of deserts. For example, El Niiio has been associated with
droughts in Australia (Nicholls, 1985) and north central Africa
(Caviedes, 1984). However, it can also lead to higher precipi-
tation and air temperatures, as in the coastal deserts of Peru and
Chile. In these deserts, Caviedes (1984) recorded about a three-
to tenfold increase in precipitation and up to a 4°C increase in
air temperature during the 1982-83 El Nifio. However, the cen-
tral areas of Peru and the higher elevation areas suffered from
drought during the El Nifio period. Sea surface temperatures
also affect humidity, and some coastal deserts may have more
dew and fog associated with ENSO events.

"The impact of climate change on soils needs to be considered
in parallel with impacts caused by unsustainable land-manage-

effects of these impacts; often they interact, leading to a greater
cumulative effect on soils than would be predicted from a sim-
ple summation of their effects. Findings follow:

"Fundamental soil properties and processes—includ-
ing organic-matter decomposition, leaching and acid-
ification, salinization, soil water regimes, soil stabili-
ty, and soil erosion—will be influenced by changes in
climate (High Confidence).

Desertification arises both from human abuse of the
land and from adverse climate conditions. Climate-
related factors such as increased drought can lead to
an increase in the vulnerability of land to desertifica-
tion and to the escalation of the desertification process
(High Confidence).

Reversing the effects of desertification is not always
possible and is more difficult for drier environments
with shallower soils (High Confidence).

Changes in the frequency and intensity of precipitation
will have the greatest direct effect on soils via erosion
by water. However, future erosion risk is likely to be
related more to increases in population density, inten-
sive cultivation of marginal lands, and the use of
resource-based and subsistence farming techniques than
to changes in precipitation regimes (High Confidence).
In structurally stable soils, greater precipitation will
increase the rate of leaching of basic cations. In the
long term, after buffering pools have become exhaust-
ed, accelerated leaching could lead to soil acidifica-
tion (High Confidence).
"	List
"Higher temperatures are likely to increase the decom-
position rate of organic matter and organic-matter loss
(High Confidence). However, too little is known
about the influence of increased atmospheric carbon
dioxide (CO,) levels on the amount of organic matter
returning to the soil to judge the extent to which soil
organic-matter levels will decline.

Where conditions become more arid, salinization and
alkalization are likely to increase because evapotran-
spiration and capillary rise will be enhanced (High
Confidence). Areas with a shallow water table may
experience increased salinization if rainfall increases
~ (Medium Confidence).

Predicted warming may give rise to higher evaporation
rates, leading to drier soils and more frequent episodes
of severe wind erosion (Medium Confidence).
Because arid and semi-arid land ecosystems have lit-
tle ability to buffer the effects of climate variability
relative to most other terrestrial ecosystems, they are
particularly vulnerable to climate change and may be
among the first ecosystems to be affected by global
environmental change (Medium Confidence).
Adaptation to desertification will rely on convention-
al strategies, such as the use of agroforestry, animals
that are better adapted to dry conditions, diverse and
multiple production systems, and water- and energy-
saving techniques (Medium Confidence).

Climate change could be beneficial to some semi-
arid and sub-humid tropical highlands because of
temperature increases and CO, fertilization (Medium
Confidence).

"Soil erosion is the movement and transport of soil by various
agents—particularly water, wind, and mass movement—that
leads to a loss of soil. Erosion has been recognized by many
scientists and some governments as a major problem since the
U.S. Dust Bowl of the 1930s (Jacks and Whyte, 1939); the
causes and processes involved have been well-researched over
the last 60 years, providing voluminous literature.

"Clearing soils of their natural vegetation cover and subse-
quently using them for arable agriculture has been the primary
cause of soil erosion onset. Historically, this has resulted in dis-
astrous soil losses, particularly in conjunction with climate
variations and extreme weather events (Bork, 1983, 1989).
More recently, population pressure in developing countries, as
well as changes in land use and management in other parts of
the world, have increased erosion susceptibility even further.

"The annual rates of new soil formation are crudely estimated
to be between 2 and 11 t/ha (Wischmeier and Smith, 1978),
although experimentally derived rates often are less than this
(Lal, 1994a). Globally, rates of soil erosion can exceed these
estimated values by 10- to 20-fold, thereby reducing produc-
tivity (Crosson and Stout, 1983; Sehgal and Abrol, 1994a,
1994b) and causing sediment and nutrient loading of rivers
(Clark et al., 1985).

"Despite scientific advances, the problem of accelerated soil
erosion is more serious now than ever before (Lal, 1994c), and
erosion hazards are being exacerbated particularly in the trop-
ics and subtropics (Lal, 1994d). Reliable estimates of the cur-
rent amounts of erosion and future areas at risk are difficult to
obtain (Table 4-1; Lal, 1994b), although erosion has been sug-
gested as affecting about 33% of the land currently used for
global crop production (Brown and Young, 1990).

change on soil erosion, salinization, and desertification, but
impacts on other degradation processes capable of being accel-

processes of importance include organic-matter loss, nutrient
loss, acidification, and soil structural deterioration (Rogasik et
al., 1994). In some instances, changes in such processes will
lead to the formation of new soil types requiring new types of
management and having different use potentials.

"With the forecast world population increase, there will be

future trends in the potential of land to produce food will be of

existing pressures caused by unsustainable land manage-

these impacts and because their cumulative impact on soils
often is greater than a simple summation.

its effects on rainfall intensity, soil erodibility, vegetative

risk can be made from a knowledge of projected changes in
these factors. General circulation models (GCMs) can provide
a range of climate scenarios, but these alone are not sufficient
to predict future erosion risk, particularly because GCMs are
currently poor predictors of changes in rainfall intensity and

"Land degradation, defined here as “a reduction in the capabili-
ty of the land to support a particular use” (Blaikie and
Brookfield, 1987), is considered to be one of the major prob-
lems facing the world (UNEP, 1992). In this chapter, we exam-
ine the likely impact of climate change on this global problem.
Will degradation of land be exacerbated or reduced? There are
many recognized forms of land degradation, including soil ero-
sion, salinization, soil contamination, loss of soil organic mat-
ter, decline in nutrient levels, acidification, and loss of soil
structure. Desertification currently affects about one-sixth of
the world’s population and one-quarter of the world’s land: 6
to 7 million hectares (Mha) are lost annually due to soil ero-
sion, and up to 20 Mha of irrigated land are affected by salin-
ization (World Resources Institute, 1992). Much of this degra-
dation is undermining economic development and is already
irreversible.
"	Text
"The main factors influencing soil erosion are rainfall
(amount, frequency, duration, and intensity), windspeed
(direction, strength, and frequency of high-intensity events),
land use and management, topography, and soils and their
properties (Morgan, 1986; Hallsworth, 1987). Since the
1950s, significant advances have been made in predicting
erosion risk, particularly through model development.
Several models that are commonly used include the Wind
Erosion Equation (Woodruff and Siddoway, 1965), the
Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) (Wischmeier and
Smith, 1978), EPIC (Williams et al., 1990; Skidmore and
Williams, 1991), WEPP (Flanagan et al., 1991), and
EUROSEM (Morgan ef al., 1992). All of these models have
weather/climate components and are capable of being manip-
ulated to predict erosion risk under different climate-change
scenarios (e.g., Favis-Mortlock, 1994). Generally, increased
rainfall intensity and amount, increased windspeed, and
increased frequencies of high-wind events—especially if
coupled with increasing droughtiness—are likely to lead to
an increase in erosion. However, erosion is site-specific, and
different permutations of conditions can increase or decrease
it. Research has predicted erosion risk as a function of land
use and environmental conditions (Nearing et al., 1994;
Skidmore et al., 1994), agronomic quality (Williams ef al.,
1984), and environmental quality (Knisel, 1980; Lal, 1994a).

land, modeled erosion changed by -5 to +22% (Phillips et al.,
1993), EPIC was used in the UK to show that, although an
increase in temperature has little effect on erosion rate, a 15%
increase in rainfall leads to a 27% increase in mean annual ero-
sion (Favis-Mortlock et al., 1991; Boardman and Favis-
Mortlock, 1993; Favis-Mortlock, 1994).

"GCMs indicate a marked change in soil moisture regime and,
therefore, attendant changes in soil erodibility, land use, and
vegetative cover. Regions likely to experience an increase in
soil moisture include southern Asia (50 to 100%), South
America (10 to 20%), and Oceania (10 to 20%). Regions like-
ly to experience decreases in soil moisture include North
America (10 to 50%), sub-Saharan Africa (10 to 70%), and
Europe (10 to 60%) (Schneider, 1989). However, with respect
to erosion, much will depend on the pattern, intensity, and sea-
sonality of rainfall events.

"A potential change in the climate might have positive effects
that lead to a decrease in soil erosion risk (Sombroek,
1991-92; Brinkman and Sombroek, 1993) as a result of nega-
tive feedback mechanisms. Examples include increased bio-
mass production, increased vegetation cover, and enhanced
soil organic-matter content resulting from elevated CO, con-
centrations. However, predicted changes in temperature, rain-
fall, and soil moisture (IPCC, 1994) suggest that few areas
will receive benefits from negative feedback effects. Instead,
projected declines in levels of soil organic matter and the
weakening of soil structure will make soils increasingly prone
to erosion.

"Soil erosion occurs when wind transports soil particles by
suspension, surface creep, or saltation over distances ranging
from a few centimeters to many kilometers. Wind erosion
not only transports soil particles around arid and semi-arid
landscapes but provides inputs into ecosystems around the
world and may even alter global climatic patterns. Wind ero-
sion is particularly problematic on sandy and organic soils
subject to low soil moisture, patchy vegetation, sporadic
rainfall, and periodic winds. Even soils resistant to wind ero-
sion can be blown away if the soil is damaged by trampling
of animals, loosening by ploughing and tillage, pulverization
by traffic (human and animal), and denudation of natural
vegetation by the expansion of agriculture, excessive graz-
ing, or fire.

wind erosion is well-documented, the feedback effect of
windblown dust in the atmosphere on the warming of the
upper atmospheric layers has not been thoroughly investi-

"Coastal salinity depends primarily on sea level and its tidal, sea-
sonal, and long-term fluctuations; the temperature, concentration,
and chemical composition of seawater; the geology, geomorpholo-

coastal salinity and salt accumulation requires comprehensive
information on the hydrological, chemical, and ecological conse-
quences of a potential rise in the eustatic sea level. Consequences
include inundation of coastal lowland plains, deltas, and estuaries
of big rivers; intrusion of saline seawater or brackish tidal water;
rapid erosion of coastlines; a rising water table; and impeded
drainage in coastal plains. In general, any rise in the eustatic sea
level will result in the territorial extension of coastal salinity under
the direct and indirect influences of saline seawater (Titus, 1987;

"Impact analysis of climatic scenarios on continental salt transport
and salt accumulation processes requires a much more complex
approach. There are three principal mechanisms of salinization:
salt accumulation, seepage, and wind deposition. Salinization by
salt accumulation occurs when leaching is reduced and salt accu-'
mulates at the surface or at some depth in the soil profile—where,
following erosion, it may become exposed (West et al., 1994).
Salinization also can occur when salt is leached into a perched
water table and then seeps to a lower point in the landscape
(Ballantyne, 1963). Salinization by wind deposition relies on a
suitable source of salt deposits. All three of these salinization
processes are likely to be affected by climate change. The effects
of two possible future climate scenarios—warm and dry versus
warm and wet—are considered in Sections 4.3.2.1 and 4.3.2.2.
Such climates are likely to show high spatial and temporal vari-
ability; various combinations of temperature and precipitation
changes are likely in nature (Manabe and Holloway, 1975;
Solomon et al., 1987; Szabolcs and Rédly, 1989). Further varia-
tions may be caused by the physiographic variability of specific
regions (agroecological unit, water catchment area, etc.)
(Jelgersma, 1988; Brammer and Brinkman, 1990; Fisher, 1990;
Szaboles, 1990) and by human activities (e.g., agricultural water-
management practices and water-conservation practices)
(Hekstra, 1989; Szabolcs, 1989; Varallyay, 1990a, 1990b, 1990c).

increasing salinity in the solid and liquid phases of the soil, salt

irrigated or imperfectly irrigated fields will lead to horizontal
groundwater inflow and/or saline seep from the surroundings
to low-lying areas. These processes result in a rise of the water
table due to increased capillary transport and thus to increasing
salinity (Varallyay, 1968, 1994).

"Soil salinity is an important chemical degradation problem for Indian agriculture, affecting 10 Mha of land—of which
2.5 Mha lie in the Indo-Gangetic Plateau. Saline soils are dominantly observed in coastal areas and in some irrigated
areas inland. Sea-level rise would adversely affect the 7,000-km coastal belt of India, comprising 20 Mha of coastal
ecosystem. A rise of 70 cm per century (IPCC, 1990) would inundate 25% of the coastal areas of Kerala, parts of
Pondicherry, Karaikal, Tamil Nadu, and vast deltaic areas of Sundarbans (West Bengal), increasing coastal salinity and
reducing crop productivity. Increased tidal ingression through creeks along the east and west coasts may further aggra-
vate coastal salinity and damage fragile wetland ecosystems. Expected losses of soil productivity will depend on the
level of sodicity but would be expected to approximate those listed in Table 4-2.

"Desertification is the process of ecological degradation by
which economically productive land becomes less produc-
tive and, in extreme cases, develops a desert-like landscape
incapable of sustaining the communities that once depended
on it (Kassas, 1988; Westing, 1994). Desertification has
aroused much emotive and scientific interest, and there are
many different definitions of the term (Verstraete, 1986).
The definition used in this chapter is the one adopted at the
United Nations Conference on Environment and Development
(UNCED) in June 1992: “...land degradation in arid, semi-
arid, and dry sub-humid areas resulting from various factors
including climatic variations and human activities” (UNEP,
1992; Hulme and Kelly, 1993). Desertification occurs most
frequently in ecosystems that have low rainfall, long dry sea-
sons, recurrent droughts, mobile surface deposits, skeletal
soils, and sparse vegetation cover (Le Houérou, 1968;
Dregne, 1983; Kassas, 1988).

"Climate-related factors such as increased drought can lead to
an increase in the vulnerability of land to desertification and to
the escalation of the desertification process. In essence, deser-
tification results from a combination of drought and misman-
agement of land—in particular, the disharmony between land
use and management on the one hand and the soil and prevail-

"Analysis of temperature data for semi-arid and arid lands by
various groups presents a more confused picture than that for
rainfall. For example, in Kenya there was a mean annual tem-
perature rise of 0.4°C over the period 1942-91, perhaps tied to
urbanization (Kinuthia et al., 1993). In South Africa, there was
no temperature trend over the 1940-90 period (Miihlenbruch-
Tegen, 1992). Central Asia did not see a consistent trend over
1900-1980 (Kharin, 1994); there was no trend in southern
France, either (Daget, 1992). Over the last 100 years, tempera-
ture in North America increased by 0,8°C (Balling, 1994).
Chapter 3 of the IPCC Working Group I volume summarizes
the global surface temperature trends for the period 1920-93.
The future magnitude of increases in temperature in arid and
semi-arid lands is likely to be similar to or lower than the glob-
al estimate of 0.005°C per annum. The greatest increase in
such lands is likely to be experienced above latitudes north and
south of 40°.

"There also is a great deal of variation in assessments of the
nature and severity of the desertification problem, due mainly to
the lack of adequate data. Some researchers suggest that almost
20 million km2 (15% of the land surface of the Earth) are sub-
ject to various degrees of desertification; they provide estimates
of the extent and severity of the problem for different regions
(Dregne, 1983, 1986; Le Houérou, 1992; Table 4-6). In addi-
tion, there have been a number of attempts to calculate the rate
of expansion of the more arid regions into the more mesic areas.
Most of these studies have employed remote sensing, notably
with air photos and large-scale satellite images (e.g., SPOT)
taken decades. apart, combined with detailed maps of ground-
control and older vegetation, forest, or range resources. Many
of these large-scale studies have suggested that the annual rate
of expansion of desertified lands in central Asia, northwest
China, northern Africa, and the Sahel ranges from 0.5 to 0.7%
of the arid zone (Le Houérou, 1968, 1979, 1989, 1992; Depierre
and Gillet, 1971; Boudet, 1972; De Wispelaere, 1980; Gaston,
1981; Haywood, 1981; Floret and Pontainier, 1982; Chao Sung
Chiao, 1984b; Peyre de Fabrégues, 1985; Vinogradov and
Kulin, 1987; Grouzis, 1988; Rozanov, 1990). Assuming a con-
servative rate of expansion of 0.5% per annum, this information
has been used to suggest an annual increment of desertified land
of 80,000 km? (see also Hulme and Kelly, 1993). Because 25%
of the arid zone already is desertified, this estimate would mean
that almost all of the world’s arid and semi-arid lands will
become desertified within the next century if rates of desert
expansion are similar to those that have prevailed over the past
50 years. Complete arid-land desertification could occur earlier
if human and livestock populations continue to increase and
particularly if the resilience of arid regions is negatively affect-
ed by climate change (Hulme and Kelly, 1993).

Eventually, all of the soft soil layers are removed, and the sit-

Their scenarios predict decreases in plant nitrogen content dur-
ing summer grazing and decreases in animal production
because of increased ambient temperature and decreased for-
age quality. Using a 1-year time-step livestock-production
model, they show for the simulations used that carrying capac-
ities would need to drop from above 6.5/ha to 9/ha to maintain

"The impact of drought on natural ecosystems is measured by
plant cover and biomass production and by the disruption of
food production systems (De Waal, 1989; Mortimore, 1989).
Drought reduces the number, phytomass, and ground cover of
plants and hence reduces the protection of the soil against ero-
sion (Grainger, 1992). Desertification has much more pro-
found and lasting effects. Desertified soils are subject to
extensive water and wind erosion and therefore lose much of
their depth and ability to store water and nutrients (Mainguet,
1986; Grainger, 1992). In the worst cases, all perennials are
removed, and the soil surface is subjected to large-scale wind
and water erosion. Without permanent vegetation protection,
the soil surface is eroded by running water, sealed and crusted
by raindrop splash, and made increasingly impervious and

"Schlesinger et al. (1990) propose that not only does drought
and the loss of vegetation cover lead to desertification, but a
mere shift in plant growth form dominance, as a consequence
of overgrazing, may drastically reduce productivity. In their
model of dryland degradation in the southwestern United
States, they suggest that overgrazing results in the redistribu-
tion of organic matter and nutrients and is the primary agent
responsible for the current conversion of previously produc-
tive grasslands to unproductive mesquite (Prosopis glandu-
losa) shrublands. Where resources within semi-arid grass-
lands previously were homogeneously distributed, overgraz-
ing results in their concentration beneath shrub islands.
Not only is the productivity of the land reduced, but posi-
tive feedback processes render the changes irreversible
(Schlesinger et al., 1990).

"Some recent research, however, has not supported the expand-
ing-desert hypothesis. First, a number of researchers question
the data upon which the severity estimates (see Table 4-6) are
based (Hellden, 1988; Thomas, 1993; Dodd, 1994). Second,
some argue that the process cannot be accurately described as
a degradation front that grows incrementally larger each year.
Arid and semi-arid systems are characterized by variable cli-
mates subject to large fluctuations in annual rainfall. During
favorable or “wet” years there is little evidence to suggest that
the desertification front expands (Thomas, 1993). On the con-
trary, a number of recent studies suggest that vegetation cover
at the margins of arid and semi-arid regions both increases and
decreases, depending largely on seasonal and annual rainfall
totals (Hoffman and Cowling, 1990b; Tucker ef al., 1991). The
different views regarding the importance of human abuse ver-
sus adverse climatic conditions in causing desertification, and
the lack of agreement on the scale of the problem, point to the
need for a better understanding of the problem and, in particu-
lar, better and more comprehensive data on its nature and
extent. There is little doubt that desertification is an important
environmental problem that needs to be addressed urgently—
and that climate change will have an impact on it.

"Two ways to save water besides improved irrigation and
drainage systems are to utilize water-efficient plants and to
develop winter-growing crops. Alfalfa, for instance (a very
popular fodder crop), is extremely water-demanding—requir-
ing about 700-1000 kg of water to produce 1 kg of fodder dry
matter—whereas some other fodder crops are less water-
demanding for the same yield. Winter-growing crops consume
much less water than summer crops because PET during win-

"In most arid and semi-arid countries, wasted water is common,
particularly in agriculture (due to inefficient irrigation sys-
tems), The amount of waste commonly reaches 50% in many
countries, but such waste often is easy to prevent with appro-
priate techniques. In many countries, water from aquifers (both
shallow and deep) is being used at rates that exceed recharge.
Increased pumping of water from these aquifers for irrigation
will hasten their depletion and threaten the availability of this
water for even more vital needs. Future development in many
countries will require water savings.

"Drainage water, which has a rather high concentration of salts,
can be re-used to grow salt-tolerant crops, including cashcrops
such as asparagus or industrial crops such as sugar beet; it also
may be used to grow timber and fodder. Some timber and fuel-
wood species can produce high yields with water having half
the salt concentration of seawater, as can a number of fodder
crops such as saltbushes, fleshy sainfoin, tall fescue, and straw-
berry clover (Le Houérou, 1986). There is, however, a poten-

waters—namely, the accelerating salinization of soil, as

"One of the primary factors affecting water availability is the
annual distribution of precipitation. There are large differences
in water availability in soils within a given land system or land-
scape, depending on topography, geomorphology, and the
nature of thé soil and its depth. Many surveys show that water
availability in contiguous soils may vary by a factor of one to
ten or more (Le Houérou, 1962; Floret and Pontainier, 1982,
1984), The actual distribution of water in soils may be modi-
fied considerably by tillage and mulching practices, soil and
water conservation techniques, runoff farming, water harvest-
ing, and wadi diversion. Most of these techniques have been
known for nearly 3,000 years in the Near and Middle East.

nearly 3,000 years ago in western China, Iran, Saudi Arabia,

used outside their own regions but are capable of development
elsewhere. Unfortunately, some of these techniques are being
abandoned in countries in which they have been in use for cen-

and Iran. The techniques of water harvesting—well-developed
in the Near East and North Africa during Roman and Byzantine
periods (200 BC to 650 AD)—could be developed again with-

structure, water-holding capacity, oxygen-holding capacity,
and nutrient storage and turnover, and it provides a habitat for
extremely large numbers of soil fauna and microflora. With the
expansion of agriculture and its intensification, soil organic-
matter levels have declined. In the United States, for example,
many prairie soils have lost more than one-third of their initial
organic-matter contents after LOO years or more of cultivation
(Papendick, 1994).
"	Text
"There are a number of other soil processes that can lead to land
degradation under a changing climate. For example, organic-
matter levels may decline; leaching may increase, giving rise
to loss of nutrients and accelerated acidification; and, in some
instances, soil structure may deteriorate. Some of these
changes already are taking place as a result of land-use
changes, poor farming practices, and industrial emissions. To
date, the changes are fairly subtle, and increasing slowly—
unlike some forms of erosion and salinization which can occur
more quickly.

"The overall strategy should be the development of diversified
and multiple production systems—including wildlife, combined
with livestock and game ranching; commercial hunting; various
tourism activities, including so-called green-tourism; runoff
farming; poultry production; and nonagricultural activities such
as handicraft. Such activities are developed to various levels in a
number of countries, such as the drylands of the United States
(west of 100° longitude), Australia, South Africa, Namibia,
Botswana, Zimbabwe, Kenya, and Tanzania. There is no reason
why these practices could not be developed elsewhere.
"	Text
"Another drought-enduring strategy utilized in the United States
and South Africa is game ranching of animals that are better
adapted to dry conditions than are livestock—including sever-
al species of Cervidae, various antelopes, and ostriches. There
are at present more than 20 Mha of game ranching in South
Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe (Le Houérou,
1994), The utilization of stock species and breeds that are bet-
ter adapted to dry conditions is a further possible adaptation.
Many East African pastoralists (Somali, Rendille, Gabra,
Samburu) have shifted recently from cattle-husbandry to
camel-rearing as a response to the deterioration of their envi-
ronment; others have increased the proportion of goats com-
pared to sheep (e.g., Turkana).

"Agroforestry may play an extremely important role in the devel-
opment of semi-arid and arid lands and in the struggle against
desertification (Le Houérou, 1980; Baumer, 1987; Le Houérou
and Pontainier, 1987). Agroforestry techniques have been
developed for centuries in some rural civilizations—such as
Kejri [Prosopis cineraria (L) Druce] in northwest India
(Rajasthan); Faidherbia albida (Del.) Chev. in various parts of
intertropical Africa; saltbushes in various arid zones of the
world; Argania spinosa (L.) Sk in southwest Morocco; Quercus
ilex L. and Q. suber L. in Spain and Portugal; and Espino
(Acacia caven Mol.) and Algarrobo (Prosopis spp) in Latin
America. Such techniques permit high rural population densi-
ties in arid zones (e.g., 60-80 people/km?) with Faidherbia in
southern Sahel, and similar densities in Rajasthan with Prosopis
cineraria and in southern Morocco with Argania (the latter
region receives <150-300 mm/yr rainfall).

"A decline in soil organic-matter contents as a result of climate
change has important implications for soil quality in general
and specifically for soil structural development because there is
a strong relationship between organic-matter levels and soil

ter levels would cause a decrease in soil aggregate stability, an
increase in susceptibility to compaction, lower infiltration rates,
increased runoff, and, hence, enhanced likelihood of erosion.

"Temperature and precipitation changes could affect soil nutri-
ent levels in several ways. Rising temperatures could act to
maintain nutrients within the soil because of increased evapo-
rative forces, and thus reduce leaching. An increase in rainfall
generally will give rise to increased nutrient loss, Conversely,
a decrease in rainfall may lead to upward movement of nutri-
ents—which, in some cases, can lead to salinization (see
Section 4.3), Nutrient loss can be compensated by the use of
inorganic and organic fertilizers, but the cost can be prohibitive
for subsistence farmers.

"Soil structure regulates water retention and movement, nutrient
transformations and movement, faunal activity and species
diversity, and the strength and penetrability of the rooting media
(Lal, 1994a), Soil structure affects the ability of the soil to be cul-
tivated, and the quality and durability of seedbeds—and thus
plant growth and vigor, grain yield, and grain quality (Shepherd,
1992). The potential for deterioration of soil structure as a result
of climate change, in conjunction with poor soil management,
has received little attention from the scientific community even
though soil structure controls water and air movement and trans-
port processes in the soil profile. Changes to soil structure are
notoriously difficult to quantify, partly because of the influence
of land use and management; research needs to be directed
toward a better understanding of this. However, some potential
consequences of climate change can be identified.
"	Text
"Most countries contain large areas of acidified soils (Wild,
1993). The extent to which acidification will increase with cli-
mate change depends on both rainfall and temperature.
Significant increases in rainfall would be accompanied by
increased leaching and thus acidification (Rounsevell and
Loveland, 1992). A decline in rainfall could reduce the extent
and intensity of acidification. In the sub-arid and sub-humid
zones, soils are subject to seasonal changes—from leaching
conditions to evaporative conditions. An altered climate could
shift conditions to a dominantly leaching regime involving
increased acidification, or to a dominantly evaporative regime
involving less acidification but possible salinization. The
direction of change will depend on the extent to which rainfall
and temperature change.

One of the soil types most affected by acidification is termed
acid sulfate soils. These soils suffer from extreme acidity as a
result of the oxidation of pyrite when pyrite-rich parent materi-

ale ara Arained (Nant 108K) Dorite arrimaulatac in watearlanced
"	List
"A second important function of soil structure—in relation to
clay soils particularly—is their influence on water quality and
seepage. Soils with high clay contents, especially those with
expanding type clays (smectitic mineralogy), tend to shrink
when they are dry and swell as they wet-up again. This behav-
ior results in the formation of large cracks and fissures. Drier
climatic conditions would be expected to increase the frequen-
cy and size of crack formation in soils, especially those in tem-
perate regions that currently do not reach their full shrinkage
potential (Climate Change Impacts Review Group, 1991). One
consequence would be more rapid and direct movement of
water and dissolved solutes from soil to surface waters or
aquifers through so-called “bypass” flow via cracks
(Armstrong et al., 1994). The more direct movement of water
in this way would decrease the filtering capacity of soil and
increase the possibility of nutrient losses and pollution of
ground and surface waters. Where animal manures or sewage
sludge are applied to land, there would be a greater risk of
organic contaminants and microorganisms reaching aquifers.

"In the case of acid soils, increased cracking could lead to an
increase in the quantity of metals (e.g., aluminum, manganese,
iron, heavy metals) entering aquifers. In these situations, the
combined effects of changes in soil chemical and biological
cycles and increased cracking need to be assessed (Rounsevell
and Loveland, 1992). An additional consequence is that the soil
profile would not re-wet as before, and the rooting zone could
be deprived of valuable water. Such changes also would have
important implications for the stability of the foundations of
buildings and roads—which would have been designed on the
basis that such soils did not reach their shrink-swell capacity
(Boden and Driscoll, 1987).

"Global estimates of land degradation generally are very crude;
as a result, it is difficult to present a meaningful picture of its
extent and severity. The most recent attempt by Oldeman et al.
(1990) helps to indicate the types and severity of land degra-
dation, but because of a lack of adequately established nation-
al surveys or a global network of monitoring sites, the results
can only be a broad approximation. Compared with air and
water, soil has received little attention in terms of monitoring;
very few countries have sound data on the quality of their
soils, and there often are few or no trend data to indicate
whether or how soil quality is changing. There is a need to
establish a comprehensive monitoring system for soil quality
at a national level that will contribute to the creation of a glob-
al picture. In the absence of such a program, there will be gen-
eral ignorance of changes in soil quality with time, leading to
an inability to address strategically any deleterious changes.
The limited information that is available suggests that land
degradation is a major global problem that urgently needs to
be addressed.

"If climate changes as projected in most climate scenarios, we
have a high degree of confidence that the length of time that
snow packs remain will be reduced, altering the timing and
amplitude of runoff from snow, and increasing evaporation.
These changes would affect water storage and delivery infra-
structure around the world (see also Chapters 10 and 14).
Alterations in precipitation regimes will modify these respons-
es. Changes in extreme events (floods and droughts) could
affect the frequency of natural hazards such as avalanches and
mudslides. Downstream consequences of altered mountain
hydrology are likely to be highly significant to economies
dependent on this water.

"Four principal factors influence mountain climates—namely,
altitude, continentality, latitude, and topography. The role of
these factors is summarized schematically in Table 5-1 (from
Barry, 1992); the effects refer to responses to an increase in the
factor listed. These climatic differences, in turn, influence veg-
etation type and cover, hydrology, and sometimes geomorphic
features. In particular, vegetation distribution in mountain
regions is so closely linked to climatic parameters that vegeta-
tion belt typology has been widely used to delineate climate
influences (Troll, 1968; Lauer, 1979; Monasterio, 1980;

"Mountain systems account for roughly 20% of the terrestrial
surface area of the globe and are found on all continents. They
are usually characterized by sensitive ecosystems and
enhanced occurrences of extreme weather events and natural
catastrophes; they are also regions of conflicting interests
between economic development and environmental conserva-
tion. Once regarded as hostile and economically nonviable
regions, mountains have attracted major economic investments
for industry, agriculture, tourism, hydropower, and communi-
cation routes. Most mountain regions except in Antarctica are
inhabited; Ives (1992) has pointed out that mountains provide
the direct life-support base for about a tenth of humankind and
indirectly affect the lives of more than half.

"Despite their relatively small surface area, mountains are an inte-
gral part of the climate system. As a physical barrier to atmospher-
ic flows, they perturb synoptic patterns and are considered to be
one of the trigger mechanisms of cyclogenesis in mid-latitudes.
Because of significant altitudinal differences, mountains such as
the Himalayas, the Rockies, the Andes, and the Alps exhibit with-
in short horizontal distances climatic regimes similar to those of
widely separated latitudinal belts; they also feature increased diver-
sity of species, communities, and habitats over lowland environ-
ments. Mountains are also a key element of the hydrological cycle,
being the source of many of the world’s major river systems.
Abrupt changes in existing temperature and precipitation patterns
that have led to the present distribution of vegetation, ice, snow and
permafrost zones would impact heavily on the unique features of
mountain environments. This, in turn, would lead to significant
perturbations to the existing socioeconomic structures for popula-
tions living within the mountains themselves and indirectly to pop-
ulations living outside these zones but dependent on them.

"A precise understanding of the climatic characteristics of
mountain regions is limited by a lack of observations ade-
quately distributed in time and space and insufficient theoreti-
cal attention given to the complex interaction of spatial scales
in weather and climate phenomena in mountains (Beniston et
al., 1994), Meteorological research has tended to focus on the
upstream and downstream influences of barriers to flow and on
orographic effects on weather systems (Smith, 1979) rather
than on microclimates within the mountain environments
themselves. Climatic features relevant to mountain environ-

"The various components of the hydrologic cycle are critical links
between climate and the life of mountain communities and also
influence areas downstream. The timing and volume of rainfall and
snowmelt are critical constraints on hydrological systems. Sediment
loadings can be exceptionally high in many rivers originating in
mountains and reflect geomorphologic processes. Unless slowed
down by major lakes within mountains themselves or in adjacent
lowlands, or by engineering works designed to control torrent
flows, rivers will carry their heavy loads unimpeded into the plains.
This can be beneficial for agriculture because these sediments cre-
ate rich and fertile soils, but excessive loads can have adverse con-
sequences, such as flooding of populated lowland areas.

"The length of many mountain glaciers in the FSU has decreased by up to 4 km during the last two centuries.
The maximum degradation has occurred in regions with strong glaciation (the Caucasus, Pamirs, Tien Shan, and
Altay),

Changes in the equilibrium line altitude (ELA: the altitude of a glacier at which snow accumulation is equal to
snow ablation) have also been more pronounced in regions with large glaciers, namely the Caucasus, Altay, and
the periphery of the Central Asian mountains, and less in other mountain zones of the FSU. The mean ELA is
estimated as being 50-80 m lower today than during the Little Ice Age.

"A major problem in many mountain regions related to climate
change is increased erosion and reduced slope stability. The
combination of complex orography with steep slopes, intense
rainstorms, and, in some regions, frequent earthquakes, caus-
es a high proportion of mass movement, which eventually
finds its way into rivers as heavy sediment load. Any changes
to an already fragile environment would impact heavily on
geomorphologic processes, resulting in indirect impacts to
natural and socioeconomic systems (Innes, 1985). For exam-
ple, higher precipitation, particularly during extreme events,
can augment the risk of erosion. However, the potential for
increased erosion depends on a number of other factors linked
to topography, geology, soil types, and farming and conserva-
tion practices associated with a particular region. Enhanced
precipitation can sometimes favor the development of denser
vegetation, which in turn prevents soils from being eroded.
Precipitation is not only a water source in mountain terrain but
also the trigger factor for the occurrence of debris flow, land-
slide, and slope failure. No general study of the relationship
between rainfall and landslides exists at a global scale, but in
many specific cases a clear relation has been established
between rain duration and induced movements (Noverraz and
Bonnard, 1992). Relations between rainfall and induced
movements can be direct and immediate or more long-term; in
many cases, a long period of rainfall prior to the event has to
be taken into account to explain a particular landslide
(Bonnard, 1994).

"Particularly in tropical and semi-arid climates, mountain areas
are usually wet, cool, and hospitable for human dwelling and
commercial cultivation. Human encroachment on mountain
regions has reduced vegetation cover, thus increasing soil-
moisture evaporation, erosion, and siltation, and thereby
adversely affecting water quality and other resources. Impact

the direct anthropogenic influence on mountain regions.

"Mountain environments are potentially vulnerable to the
impacts of global warming because the combination of
enhanced sensitivity to climatic change and limited possibilities
for species migration to favorable locations make mountains
“islands” in a “sea” of surrounding ecosystems (Busby, 1988).
This vulnerability has important ramifications for a wide vari-
ety of human uses and natural systems, such as nature conser-

also has implications for a wide range of natural systems

lack of comprehensive multidisciplinary data for impact
studies, which is one of the prerequisites for case stud-
ies of impacts on natural or socioeconomic systems
(Kates et al., 1985; Riebsame, 1989; Parry et al., 1992).
The complexity of mountain systems presents major
problems for assessing the potential impacts of cli-
mate change. This applies to assessments of changes
in both biophysical systems (e.g., Rizzo and Wiken,
1992; Halpin, 1994) and societal systems, the latter in
particular because it is difficult to quantify the value
of mountain regions in monetary terms (Price, 1990).
Tourism, which is an increasingly important compo-

economic sector and is highly influenced by factors
other than climate change.

"Mitigation and adaptation strategies to counteract possible
consequences of abrupt climate change in mountain regions
require climatological information at high spatial and temporal
resolution. Unfortunately, present-day simulation techniques
for predicting climate change on a regional scale are by no
means satisfactory. This is because GCMs generally operate
with a rather low spatial resolution over the globe (~300 km)
in order to simulate climate trends over a statistically signifi-
‘cant period of time. As a result, entire regions of sub-conti-
nental scale have been overlooked in terms of their climato-
logical specificities, making it difficult to predict the conse-
quences of climate change on mountain hydrology, glaciers, or
ecosystems in a specific mountain region (Giorgi and Mearns,
1991; Beniston, 1994). The situation is currently improving
with the advent of high-resolution climate simulations in
which the spatial scale of GCMs is on the order of 100 km
(Beniston et al., 1995; Marinucci et al., 1995). However, even
this resolution is generally insufficient for most impact studies.

"The major mountains of North America are the Rockies, the eastern Appalachian chain, and various coastal ranges along
the west coast of the continent. Primarily in the United States and in Mexico, the mountains border on semi-arid, highly
populated urban areas (Mexico City, Los Angeles, Denver); most North American mountains are sparsely populated,
however. Traditional economies have been in the mining and pastoral fields, with limited agriculture where the climate
allows it. Forest harvest and replanting has been practiced in many areas. Much of the remaining area, especially in the
Western United States and Canada, is set aside for wilderness, where human influence is minimized, and for parks,
which are managed (Peine and Martinka, 1992). Because of this rather significant wilderness designation (over 16 mil-
lion hectares, about 6% of all forested lands in the United States alone), adaptation to the potential impact of global cli-
mate change on natural ecosystems and biological diversity is more an administrative management issue than a scientific
one (OTA, 1993). One problem is that wilderness areas tend to occupy only the tops of mountains, not the entire moun-
tain, limiting the availability of diverse habitats and hence migration opportunities.

"Climate-driven hydrology in mountain regions is detetmined to a
large extent by orography itself; mountain belts produce regional-
scale concentration of precipitation on upwind slopes and rain-
shadow effects in the lee of mountains and in deep intermontane
valley systems, often giving rise to high mountain deserts. Many
of the more elevated mountain chains of the world intercept large
atmospheric moisture fluxes and produce belts of intense precipi-
tation. Along the southern slopes of the Himalayas, enhancement
of monsoonal conditions results in some of the highest annual
average precipitation in the world, such as at Cherrapunji, India.
The spectrum of variability of hydrological regimes ranges from
the predominantly rainforested slopes of Papua-New Guinea to
the ice fields of the Patagonian Andes. Climate change will affect
the relative importance of these two extreme regimes, as well as
the total moisture flux and how it is delivered temporally.
Mountains such as the Andes and the Himalayas are source
regions for some of the world’s largest rivers, such as the Amazon,
the Ganges, Irrawady, and Yangtse, and the discharge characteris-

of the area for the period 1981/1991. Sensitivity studies show that
lower elevations (i.e., below 1500 m) are extremely sensitive to
small changes in temperature, especially in the southern part of
the French Alps. Variations of precipitation amount influence the
maximum snow depth (or snow water equivalent) much more

effect of intense rainfall in low- to middle-altitude regions is to
produce some of the highest global rates of slope erosion.
Climate change could alter the magnitude and/or frequency of

"In terms of climate-change impacts on snow, Féhn (1991) sug-
gests that one potential effect of global warming in the
European Alps might be a delay in the first snowfall and a
reduction in the length of snow cover. Analysis of satellite data
from the 1980s and early 1990s has shown that lowlands around
the Alps experience about 3~4 weeks less snow cover than they
historically have had (Batimgartner and Apfl, 1994); this ten-
dency will likely accelerate in a warmer climate. Additionally,
snow accumulation and ablation exhibit different temporal pat-
terns than in the past and could be even more irregular in a
changed climate. For higher elevations, the total annual snow
volume accumulated during the winter has not changed signifi-
cantly this century, despite the observed global temperature rise.

"Other impacts associated with extreme events include fire.
Forest fires are likely to increase in places where summers
become warmer and drier, as has been projected for the Alps, for
example (Beniston et al., 1995). Prolonged periods of summer
drought would transform areas already sensitive to fire into
regions of sustained fire hazard. The coastal ranges of
California, the Blue Mountains of New South Wales (Australia),
Mt. Kenya, and mountains on the fringes of the Mediterranean
Sea, already subject to frequent fire episodes, would be severe-
ly affected. There would be major socioeconomic impacts as
well, because many sensitive regions are located close to major
population centers (e.g., Los Angeles and the Bay Area in
California; the Sydney conurbation in Australia; coastal resorts
close to the mountains in Spain, Italy, and southern France).

"Large rockfalls in high mountainous areas often are caused by
groundwater seeping through joints in the rocks. If average and

tions of the effects of future climate change on the Earth’s biota. These include changing seasonality, which may result in
unexpected vegetation patterns (Prentice et al., 1991); rapid changes in both climate and vegetation with ecosystem-wide
implications (Gear and Huntley, 1991); and short-term extreme events that may impact tree population structures (Lloyd
and Graumlich, 1995), Thus, the same types of individualistic behavior of species observed in physiological attributes
are mirrored in long-term and large-scale vegetation dynamics (Graumlich, 1994).

"In the Alps, the main climatic space contraction and fragmenta-

belts, where rare and endemic species with low dispersal capac-
ities could become extinct. Because the alpine belt contains a
non-negligible part of the endemic alpine flora (15%; Ozenda
and Borel, 1991), the potential impact of climate change on
floristic diversity in the Alps could be significant. Halpin (1994)
states that the process is more complex than suggested above.
Even if vegetation belts do not move up as a whole in response
to global climate change, the ecological potential of sites will
change in relation to shifts in climatic features.

"Heide and coworkers have clearly shown that photoperiod con-
straints in cold climates may be strong and of overriding
importance (Heide, 1985; Solhaug, 1991). For most native
species, the precise photoperiodic requirements and their inter-
action with temperature are not known, thus making it difficult
to estimate plant migration based on temperature scenarios
alone (Ozenda and Borel, 1991). According to Heide (1989,
1990), some alpine grasses have no photoperiod requirements
for initiating growth and are therefore affected by spring frosts.
For example, in northern Sweden, Molau (1993) has shown
that increased length of the growing season and increased sum-
mer temperature are the two components of climate change
that will have the greatest impact on reproduction and popula-
tion dynamics in arctic and alpine plants.

"A general hypothesis presented by Peters and Darling (1985)
and others concerns the potential movement of the climatic
ranges of species along altitudinal, thermally defined gradients.
This conceptual model implies that the boundaries of present
species’ climatic ranges will respond symetrically to changes in
temperature related to the adiabatic lapse rate for a particular
mountain site. The general biogeographical rule used to derive
this conceptual model is attributed to the “Hopkins bioclimatic
law” (MacArthur, 1972; Peters and Darling, 1985), which
relates a 3°C change in temperature to a 500 m change in alti-
tude. According to this conceptual model, the expected impacts
of climate. change in mountainous nature reserves would
include the loss of the coolest climatic zones at the peaks of the
mountains and the linear shift of all remaining vegetation belts
upslope. Because mountaintops are smaller than bases, the pre-
sent belts at high elevations would occupy smaller and smaller
areas, and the corresponding species would have smaller popu-
lations and might thus become more vulnerable to genetic and
environmental pressure (Peters and Darling, 1985; Hansen-
Bristow et al., 1988; Bortenschlager, 1993).

"If climatic change leads to warmer and locally drier conditions,
mountain vegetation could suffer as a result of increased evap-
otranspiration. This is most likely for continental and
Mediterranean mountains. A change in regional distribution of
air humidity could strongly modify the tree species composi-
tion of mountain forests; drier conditions, for example, would
give continental species an advantage. If changes in water sup-
ply were to occur during summer, they would also become
effective indirectly by influencing topsoil processes and plant
nutrition (Bowman ef al., 1993; Baron et al., 1994). When
temperatures are low, microbial activity in alpine soils is con-
centrated in the top few centimeters. This is the part of the soil
where nutrient recycling and most of the root growth takes
place; when this top layer desiccates, mineral cycling is
blocked (K6émer, 1989). Regular rainfall is thus a prerequisite
for plant nutrition. Because most alpine plants are inherently
slow growers, any enhancement of nutrient supply will stimu-
late the few potentially fast-growing species in a community,
eliminate others, and thus cause substantial changes in vegeta-
tion structure.

similar conclusions regarding the sensitivity of forests in the
European Alps. As an example of such a model application,
Figure 5-2 illustrates the modeled forest changes in the alpine
zone under differing climatic scenarios. Potential regional devel-
opment of forest vegetation (using the FORSUM model;
Kriuchi, 1994) at the Derborence site in the Swiss Alps is illus-
trated for no change in climate (upper) and for the IPCC IS92A

as a result of successional processes. While the overall forest
biomass might remain the same, the species composition will be
different under the two climates, with a reduction in the compet-

of broadleaves under the IS92A scenario (Kriuchi, 1994).

titative changes in vegetation. Another 11 species regarded as potentially vulnerable may experience substantial reduc-
tion and fragmentation of their populations. The most threatened species are characterized by rarity, low competitive
ability, narrow habitat amplitude, and a distributional optimum in the middle alpine zone. Increased drought and over-
heating will probably have the most negative short-term (50-150 years) effects on mountain plant populations. In the

to large departures. It is likely that later-maturing varieties would be adopted under much warmer conditions to exploit

"To examine the effect of climatic variability on rice suitability, simple empirical indices have been developed relating
rice yield to July/August mean air temperature in upland regions of Tohoku and Hokkaido in northern Japan (Yoshino et

effects of anomalous weather on yield and on potentially cultivable areas for both cool and warm departures from a cur-
rent mean climate. The results indicate that a July/August temperature departure of -1.1°C in Hokkaido would reduce
yields by some 25% relative to the average, and the potentially cultivable area would contract to elevations below 100 m
in a small area of southwestern Hokkaido, where the Sea of Japan acts to ameliorate the climate. A comparable anomaly
in Tohoku (-1.0°C) would produce a 13% yield shortfall, and the cultivable area would contract by some 20%, to areas

also derive from changes in mountain landscapes—the “‘capital”

according to future climate scenarios (New Zealand Ministry

the largest changes in winter, which corresponds to the time of
peak heating requirements. There will also be less seasonal
variation in runoff and more opportunity to generate power

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
"	Title
"Wetlands have many functions that have socioeconomic benefits:
They provide refuge and breeding ground for many species,
including commercially valuable ones; they are areas of high bio-
diversity; they control floods and droughts and improve water
quality; and they are used for recreation and education. The direct
economic value of these benefits varies between regions.
"	Text
"Human activities—such as the conversion of wetlands to agri-
cultural and forest lands, construction of dams and embank-
ments, and peat mining—already pose a serious threat to wet-
lands worldwide. Mainly as a result of these activities, it is
estimated that more than half of the world’s wetlands have dis-
appeared during the last century. These anthropogenic effects
are most notable in densely populated areas and are expected
to increase, especially in developing countries.
"	Text
"We are highly confident that hydrologic changes or other dis-
turbances that change the vegetation types in wetland areas
will affect other wetland functions as well. However, many
wetlands have inherently high spatial and temporal variability
in plant communities due to climatic variations (e.g., seasonal
flooding or drought) and variations in microtopography. We
are confident that in some wetlands a changed plant communi-
ty as a result of climate change will resemble at least some
component of the existing community.
"	Text
"We are highly confident that climate change will affect the
cycling of carbon in wetlands: Some carbon-sequestering wet-
lands will change from CO, sinks to sources due to a lowering
of the water table or increased temperature. Changes in the
source/sink relationship of wetlands have already occurred in
parts of the arctic region. Climate change leading to an alteration
in the degree of saturation and flooding of wetlands would affect
both the magnitude and the timing of CH, emissions. Drying of
northern wetlands could lead to declines in CH, emissions.
"	Text
"Adaptation, conservation, and restoration of wetlands in response
to climate change varies among wetland types and the specific
function being considered. For regional and global functions (e.g.,
trace-gas fluxes and carbon storage), there are no human respons-
es that can be applied at the scale necessary. For wetland functions
that are local in scale (habitat value, pollution trapping, and to
some degree flood control), possibilities exist for adaptation, cre-
ation, and restoration. However, wetland creation and restoration
technologies are just developing, and we do not yet have reliable
techniques to create wetlands for many specific purposes.
"	Text
"We are confident that climate change will affect the areal
extent and distribution of wetlands, although at present it is not
possible to estimate future areal size and distribution of wet-
lands from climate-change scenarios. Regional studies from
east China, the United States, and southern Europe indicate
that the area of wetlands will decrease if the climate becomes
warmer. Climate warming also would have severe impacts on
wetlands in arctic and subarctic regions in this respect because
it would result in a melting of permafrost, which is the key fac-
tor in maintaining high water tables in these ecosystems.
"	Text
"Although there are many different systems for defining and
classifying wetlands, for this chapter we define wetlands gen-
erally as areas of land where the water table is at or near the
surface for some defined period of time, leading to unique
physiochemical and biological processes and conditions char-
acteristic of waterlogged systems. Wetlands exist in both
inland and coastal areas, covering approximately 4-6% of the
Earth’s land surface. They are found on every continent except
Antarctica and in every climate from the tropics to the tundra.
This chapter examines the possible impacts of climate change
on non-tidal (primarily inland) freshwater wetlands.
"	Text
"We are highly confident that climate change will have its great-
est effect on wetlands by altering their hydrologic regimes.
Any alterations of these regimes will influence biological, bio-
geochemical, and hydrological functions in wetland ecosys-
tems, thereby affecting the socioeconomic benefits of wetlands
that are valued by humans. Due to the heterogeneity of non-
tidal wetlands, and because their hydrologic conditions vary
greatly within and among different wetland types and sites, the
impacts of climate change on these ecosystems will be site-
specific. Impacts can be generalized for specific wetland types
and, to some degree, wetland regions. However, generalization
across wetland types is difficult and cannot be made in terms
of locations or wetland categories.

"Wetlands usually are categorized according to their character-
istic vegetation; their location (coastal or inland); the salinity
of the water they contain; or other biological, chemical, hydro-
logical, and geographical features. Coastal wetlands are influ-
enced by the ebb and flow of tides and may include tidal salt
marshes, tidal freshwater marshes, and mangrove swamps (see
Chapter 9).

"This is the first time that IPCC has attempted a detailed assess-
ment of the potential impacts of climate change on the struc-
ture and function of wetlands. Previous assessments briefly
touched upon wetlands in a qualitative discussion of methane
(CH,) sources and sinks (Melillo et al., 1990) and discussed
wetlands in the context of ecosystem responses to increased
CO, concentrations, illustrated by case studies of the arctic tun-
dra and a salt marsh.
"	Text
"More than seventy global classification schemes exist interna-
tionally. Because the response of wetlands to climate change
tends to be site- or region-specific, no existing scheme is use-
ful for this chapter in relating geographic or physical features
with climate responses. For this reason, this chapter will focus
on describing the climate and other variables that determine the
response of individual wetland sites, rather than attempting to
correlate responses with particular wetland types.
"	Text
"This chapter gives particular emphasis to the possible impacts
of climate change on the areal extent, distribution, and func-
tions of non-tidal wetlands, in the context of other natural or
anthropogenic stressors that are likely to affect these ecosys-
tems simultaneously. In addition to describing the importance
of different climate variables and the range of factors that
determine the sensitivity of individual wetlands, the chapter
uses four case studies to illustrate the effects of climate change
on certain defined wetland areas: the Sahel, northern boreal
wetlands, Kalimantan (Indonesia), and the Florida Everglades.
"	Text
"This chapter covers inland wetlands, or those not subject to tidal
influences—including peatlands, swamps, marshes, and flood-
plains. Peatlands consist of bogs and fens, which may be forest-
ed, and are peat-accumulating wetlands in moist climates (peat
is partially decomposed plant material). Bogs are acidic, poor in
nutrients, and receive water from precipitation only, whereas
fens are generally circumneutral, richer in nutrients, and receive
water primarily from overland flow and/or groundwater.
Swamps or forested wetlands are areas with little or no peat
accumulation. Marshes or herbaceous wetlands and floodplains
are flooded areas along rivers or lakes (Zoltai and Pollet, 1983),
"	Text
"The present assessment is hindered because the literature on
wetlands is highly variable in quality and coverage and large
gaps in knowledge remain regarding many of their regulating
processes. In particular, relatively few studies exist on the
impacts of climate change on inland wetlands; most that do
exist have been carried out on specific wetland sites and/or
have tended to focus on the Northern Hemisphere. These fac-
tors are reflected in the examples and conclusions in this chap-
ter and in the emphasis on case studies. Recently, wetlands and
wetland-related topics have begun to receive increasingly
greater attention, and new information is expected to be pub-
lished in the near future.
"	Text
"For this assessment, we focus on climate-change effects on
hydrology as an integrative tool for our analysis. However,
these effects are highly site-specific, and there are few general,
categorical conclusions that can be drawn. There is extreme
hydrological variation between and even within individual
wetlands, such as differences in the direction of water flow
(vertical, unidirectional, or bidirectional; Lugo et al., 1990b).
This variability, coupled with the resolution at which these
hydrological differences can be found, reinforces the need to
describe wetland responses on a site-by-site basis. It is possi-
ble to generalize impacts for specific wetland types and, to
some degree, wetland regions, but it is difficult to generalize
across different wetland types.
"	Text
"Wetlands exist in both inland and coastal areas, covering
approximately 4-6% of the Earth’s land surface. A wide vari-
ety of wetland definitions are found in the literature. Cowardin
et al. (1979) argue that there is no single, correct, indisputable,
ecologically sound definition for wetlands, primarily because
of the diversity of wetlands and because the demarcation
between dry and wet environments lies along a continuum. In
general, a wetland describes any area of land where the water
table is at or near the surface for some defined period of time,
leading to unique physiochemical and biological processes and
conditions characteristic of shallowly flooded systems (Mitsch
and Gosselink, 1993). This chapter will discuss both perma-
nent and temporary wetlands.
"	Text
"Many studies have shown that hydrologic parameters are
strong controllers of wetland ecosystem structure and func-
tion (Gosselink and Turner, 1978; Novitzki, 1989; Kangas,
1990). The source, renewal rate, and timing of the water
regime directly control the spatial and temporal heterogene-
ity of wetland ecosystem structure and function. The
hydroperiod—defined as the depth, frequency, duration, and
season of flooding—is usually the single most important reg-
ulator in wetlands, controlling many of their important char-
acteristics (Lugo et al., 1990a). The hydroperiod is deter-
mined by the climate, topography, catchment area, soils, and
geology of the region in which the wetland is situated
(Armentano, 1990).

"wetlands, especially in tropical regions, have so far escaped the
impacts of human activities owing to their remoteness and
unsuitability for agriculture (see Section 6.5.4). However, in
recent decades, population pressures and technological advances
have extended human influences into previously undisturbed
areas (Armentano, 1990). For example, in 1989 it was calculat-
ed that only 82% of Indonesia’s peat swamp forests remained in
their original condition (Silvius, 1989); for some provinces (e.g.,
South Sumatra), it is predicted that no swamp forest will be left
by the year 2000 (PHPA and AWB, 1990). Table 6-1 summarizes
the main causes of present-day wetland loss.

"Wetlands are found on every continent except Antarctica and in
every climate from the tropics to the tundra (Mitsch and Wu,
1995; Mitsch and Gosselink, 1993). Matthews and Fung (1987)
recently conducted extensive surveys to determine the distribu-
tion of wetlands on a global scale and estimate that wetlands
account for an area of 5.3 x 10° km2, or approximately 4% of
the Earth’s land surface (Figures 6-1 and 6-2). This estimate is
similar to other recent estimates (e.g., Aselmann and Crutzen,
1989) but indicates a possible reduction from previous esti-
mates of around 6% (Bazilivich et al, 1971; Maltby and Turner,
1983). However, any estimate of global coverage will depend
significantly on the definition of a wetland that is used.
"	Text
"Wetlands already are threatened by a range of environmental
factors, which can be natural or anthropogenic. It is estimated
that more than half of the world’s wetlands have disappeared
since 1900. In the lower 48 states of the United States, approxi-
mately 53% of the original wetland area has been lost; 87% of
this loss is attributed to agricultural development, 8% to urban
development, and 5% to other conversions (Maltby, 1986). The
same is valid for most of the developed regions of the world. The
status of wetlands in developing countries is currently unknown
to a large extent, but population pressures in many regions are
steadily increasing the demand for food (Dugan, 1988), which
can lead to wetland loss due to agricultural development. Many

However, large-scale harvesting of peat has led to the destruc-
tion of peatland ecosystems, and peat mining has the dual effect
of removing a CO, sink (but a source of CH,) and adding to the
CO, in the atmosphere (see Rodhe and Svensson, 1995).

"Wetlands play an important role in the global budgets of car-
bon (C) and the trace gases CH, and nitrous oxide (N,O).
Wetland soils represent a major pool of C that may respond
dynamically to climate change (Woodwell et al., 1995). Boreal
wetlands, which are extremely susceptible to climate change,
are a major contributor to the global CH, budget (Matthews
and Fung, 1987).

"In the recent past, nonconsumptive benefits of wetlands such
as recreation (Mercer, 1990), archaeology (Coles, 1990), edu-
cation, and science usually were given lower priority in man-
agement plans than directly consumptive values because they
are highly aesthetic and their values are difficult to quantify
(Reimold and Hardinsky, 1979). However, these values have
been given much greater attention in recent years, and wet-
lands worldwide are starting to be considered highly valuable
areas to conserve.

"Probably the best known function of wetlands is as a provider
of year-round habitats, breeding areas, and wintering sites for
migratory birds, depending on their location (Bellrose and
Trudeau, 1988; Dugan, 1993). One example is the prairie pot-
hole region in the United States, where the value of the region
as habitat for breeding birds, especially waterfowl, has been
thoroughly documented. Annual production is correlated with
the number of wet basins for many duck species (Boyd, 1981;
Krapu et al., 1983; Reynolds, 1987). More than half of the
waterfowl production in North America occurs within this
region (Batt et al., 1989).

"The total biodiversity (flora and fauna) of wetlands generally is
high in comparison with terrestrial ecosystems. Wetlands pro-
vide protective cover and essential feeding, breeding, and mat-
uration areas for a wide range of invertebrates, as well as cold-
and warm-blooded vertebrates (Gosselink and Maltby, 1990;
Clark, 1979). Some animals are entirely dependent on wetland
habitats; others are only partially so. In North America, for
example, muskrats and beavers fall into the dependent group,
whereas raccoons and various species of deer fall into the non-
dependent one. In many areas, the remoteness and inaccessi-
bility of wetlands has attracted species that may not be totally

"Poiani et al. (1995) show that the seasonality of precipitation
changes is very important to wetland ecosystems. Climate
change affecting spring precipitation and runoff may have the
greatest impact on wetland hydrology and vegetation. Some
modeling studies have indicated that there may be a threshold
temperature beyond which changes in precipitation become
less important to wetland hydrology. In one study, Poiani and
Johnson (1993) conclude that precipitation changes are much
less influential on hydrological regimes under a +4°C scenario
than under a +2°C scenario.

"Arctic and subarctic peatlands will be extremely vulnerable to
climate change if warmer temperatures lead to a thawing of the
permafrost layer and affect their hydrology through drainage or
flooding (Gorham, 1994; Oechel and Vourlitis, 1994; OTA,
1993), These wetlands have a limited capacity to adapt to cli-
mate change because it is unlikely that new permafrost areas
will form. In addition, non-tidal wetlands located near the coast
are vulnerable to changes in climate due to sea-level rise,
which would have severe impacts resulting from chemical and
hydrological changes caused by intrusion of saline seawater
(see Section 6.5.5).

"Precipitation regulates the direct inflow and amount of water to
wetland ecosystems. However, the effect of a change in pre-
cipitation on a given wetland will depend on the type of wet-
land and the topographic and geographic characteristics of the
region (drainage area, relief, and so forth). For example, very
large wetlands, like the Okawango delta in Africa, are supplied
with water from a considerable distance. In this case, the spa-
tial variability of climate change could affect the balance
between supply and evaporative demand. Further, in wetlands
located along floodplains, a change in water availability
throughout the drainage area or region will affect flooding and
the hydrological regime in complex ways.

"Current research suggests that elevated CO, levels may have a
direct fertilization effect on some types of vegetation, leading to
higher production rates (Idso and Kimball, 1993). Elevated CO,
concentrations seem to increase plant tolerance to stress, includ-

and waterlogging (Hogan et al., 1991). However, multi-species,
intact ecosystems may show complex responses to an increase
in CO, concentrations (Korner and Arnone, 1992). Elevated
CO, concentrations in the atmosphere also may affect the rate
of evapotranspiration through changes in water usage by plants
(Bunce, 1992; Kimball and Idso, 1983). However, the effects of
increased CO, on transpiration and water-use efficiency appear
to decrease as water availability increases or as temperature
decreases (Oechel and Strain, 1985). Any changes in transpira-

regimes because vegetation is a critical component of the

"It is difficult to determine the vulnerability of specific types of
non-tidal wetlands to climate change. One line of reasoning
suggests that wetlands in naturally stressed environments
appear to tolerate less additional stress than those located in
favorable conditions (Lugo and Brown, 1984), meaning that
they are more vulnerable to the alterations in hydrological
regimes that are expected to result from climate change. By
this reasoning, depressional wetlands (found in depressions in
the landscape) with small watershed areas and situated in areas
where the climate is either dry or wet at present will be most
susceptible to these effects (Mitsch and Wu, 1995). In contrast,
wetlands along floodplains and lakes should be able to adapt to
a changing climate by migrating along river edges up- and
downstream as well as up- and downslope to follow water—
although the efficiency of such migration will be dependent on
a number of factors, including catchment area, topography, and
human settlements.

wetland development. At this time, however, any estimation of
the change in global areal extent would be very uncertain (see

"In some cases, the movement of water in itself can benefit wet-
lands because it contributes to nutrient transport, aeration, and

toxic compounds that otherwise could accumulate in sediments
(Lugo et al., 1990a). However, extremely intense hydrological
fluxes tend to stress wetland ecosystems.

"A few studies have attempted to estimate possible regional
changes in wetland distribution, although they tend to involve
areas that are projected to experience net losses in water avail-
ability rather than areas that are expected to experience
increases. For example, a study by Brock and van Vierssen
(1992) of hydrophyte-dominated wetlands in southern semi-
arid regions of Europe concludes that an increase in tempera-
ture of 3-4°C would decrease the areal extent of habitat for
hydrophytes by 70 to 85% within 5 years—suggesting that
wetlands in other semi-arid and arid regions will be very sen-
sitive to climate warming (see Section 6.5.2).

"Wetlands are sensitive to extreme climate events such as heavy
spring flooding and summer drought (Gorham, 1991).
Potential changes in precipitation patterns related to the ampli-
tude, periodicity, or frequency of extreme events are critical
components in modeling wetland responses to climate change
(Poiani and Johnson, 1993). Extreme droughts make wetlands
more sensitive to fire (see Sections 6.5.4 and 6.5.5; Gorham,
1994), which could impact ecological functions such as vege-
tation cover, habitat value, and carbon cycling. At the same
time, such biomass burning is likely to result in massive emis-
sions of smoke particles (aerosols) to the atmosphere, which
may offset some warming, at least regionally (Penner et al.,
1992), Sea-level rise may affect some inland wetlands, causing
saltwater intrusion that could result in an encroachment of salt-
tolerant wetland communities.

"Combined changes in temperature, evapotranspiration, precip-
itation, and CO, concentrations ultimately affect the hydrolog-
ic regime in a wetland ecosystem. It is critical to consider these
combined effects because responses can be nonlinear. For
example, it has been found that relatively small differences in
precipitation can produce substantial differences in water level,
especially for smaller temperature increases (Poiani and
Johnson, 1993). Whereas decreased water availability will
cause wetland loss due to concomitant drying, climate models
suggest that some areas will become wetter—particularly high-
latitudes in the winter. Although few studies have examined the
potential impacts in these cases, it is conceivable that wetter
conditions could be conducive to wetland development in areas
not currently occupied by wetlands—as has occurred in areas
of the Sahel (see Section 6.5.2).

"Poiani and Johnson (1993) conducted a study to understand how
possible changes in the areal extent of a semipermanent wetland
in the prairie pothole region of the United States might affect its
ecological functions, For this study, they developed a simulation
model for hydrological and vegetation responses. Using output
from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) general cir-
culation model (GCM) for current and doubled-CO, climates
(mean monthly air-temperature increase of 3 to 6°C and precip-
itation ranging from -17% to +29%) in an 11-year simulation,
they project a 3% increase in the overall size of this wetland
under current climate but a decrease of nearly 12% under the
greenhouse scenario. Further, the areas of open water would
decrease from 51% at the beginning of the simulation to 0% by
the fourth year, allowing emergent plant species to spread over
the entire wetland. This change would have serious implications
for the wildlife in the region because these areas are extremely
important breeding areas for waterfowl (see Section 6.2.1). This
study indicates that even if the total decrease in wetland area due
toa warmer climate is relatively small (12%), the overall change
in wetland characteristics can have severe effects on many of the
existing functions and values of wetlands. The model also indi-
cates that wetland size, depth, and vegetative characteristics are
more sensitive to changes in temperature than to either increas-
es or decreases in precipitation.

strongly influences wetland soil microbial populations (Melillo

Several studies have found strong links between wetland plant
community types and microbial decomposition and nutrient-

and the release or “mineralization” of nutrients contained
therein enhances plant productivity and litter quality (nutrient
content, degradability; Pastor, 1984), Different plant commu-
nities demonstrate different rates of nitrogen availability to
plants, carbon storage, and microbial processing of pollutants

"Another implication for northern peatlands is the expected
melting of permafrost due to higher temperatures (see Chapter
7). Harriss (1987) concludes that an increase in temperature of
2°C would shift the southern boundary of permafrost in the
Northern Hemisphere to the north. The, melting of permafrost
is likely to have drastic effects on peatland hydrology and land-
scape patterns, leading to lowered water tables in some areas
and flooded thaw lakes in others, as well as to thermokarst ero-
sion (Billings, 1987; Gorham, 1991). It has been suggested
(Zoltai and Wein, 1990) that such melting may shift bogs on
permafrost back to fens, from which they originated after the
warm mid-Holocene period. Vegetetation could shift from
black spruce/Sphagnum/lichen (which are typical for bog
ecoystems) to grasses, sedges, and reeds. Further, the rate of
climate-change impacts on northern peatlands may be such that
it causes degradation of southern regions much faster than the
northern regions can expand northward (Gorham, 1991). These
shifts also would have implications for the carbon cycle, as
well as the flux of especially CH, from northern peatlands (see

evapotranspiration over precipitation. If rates of evapotranspi-

in these wetlands, which could impair the value of wetlands
due to the loss of intolerant species. Wetlands that are present-
ly freshwater could become saline. However, in regions facing
a decrease in evapotranspiration, the existing saline wetlands
could gradually change as salinity decreases. This will affect

mates are based are biased toward wetlands in northern North
America and the Scandinavian countries (Bartlett and Harriss,

ation in the degree of saturation and flooding of wetlands
would affect both the magnitude and the timing of CH, emis-

lead to declines in CH, emissions (Roulet et al., 1993;

table are more significant between 0-30 cm than between
30-60 cm (Silvola et al., 1985). Any lowering of the water
table would mean, on the average, an extra carbon release of
about 100-300 g C/m?/yr. Further, an increase in temperature
of 1-5°C in northern peatlands could decrease carbon accumu-

"The impacts of climate change on wetlands will interact with
other anthropogenic stresses. Due to the importance of hydro-
logical regime and wetland response, we confine ourselves to
discussing the cumulative impacts of hydrological changes in
wetlands. Apart from climate change, the most common dis-
turbances to the hydrological regimes of wetland ecosystems
are alterations in plant communities, storage of surface water,
road construction, drainage of surface water and soil water,
alteration of ground water recharge and discharge areas, and
pumping of ground water. All of the anthropogenic activities
and natural causes mentioned in Table 6-1 will, to various
extents, impact the hydrology of wetlands. Drainage for agri-
culture, for example, would cause drastic changes in water
level and means near-total destruction of wetland ecosystems,
whereas construction of dams for water management could be
less severe if efforts to maintain waterflow through the sub-
jected wetlands are made. Due to site-specific responses by
wetland ecosystems and the large range of plausible anthro-
pogenic and natural stressors, a quantitative evaluation of them
in combination with climate change is difficult. It is conceiv-
able, however, that within the next decades the main threat to
wetlands is likely to be due to anthropogenic activities rather
than climate change.

"The human carrying capacity of the Sahel region is already
matched or exceeded by population density (van der Graaf and
Breman, 1993); dryland agriculture or large-scale migration to
other parts of the region are unlikely to be able to relieve the
situation. As a result, wetlands will be more sought-after, and
pressure for conversion of wetlands to rice fields should
increase due to increasing urbanization in West Africa and its
effects on the demand for rice.

"Possible impacts: With the possible exceptions of eastern Niger and Chad, climate change is expected to decrease the
extent of wetlands in the Sahel, due to changes in temperature and precipitation projected by current scenarios. These
changes are likely to result in a net loss of water in most of the large rivers in the Sahel over the next 30-60 years, with
the exception of the major rivers flowing into Lake Chad. Although few studies exist on the effects on species, the loss
of wetlands due to climate change could create a risk of extinction for some local populations of turtles and birds.

"The Sahelian wetlands are dynamic ecosystems (see Box 6-1).
During the past 2 decades, new wetlands of up to 1,800 hectares
have formed, while other wetlands have been degraded (Piaton
and Puech, 1992; Brouwer and Mullié, 1994a). Wetlands in the
Sahel include the floodplains of the large rivers and Lake Chad,
as well as thousands of small permanent and temporary wetland
ecosystems scattered throughout the region (see Sally et al.,
1994; Brouwer and Mullié, 1994a; Windmeijer and Andriesse,

small-scale irrigation. In the period 1984-91, between 42,000

for dry-season cropping, generating an annual income of
$200-$4,300 per hectare (MAE-Niger, 1993; Raverdeau,
1991; Cherefou Mahatan, 1994). In 1990, 4.1x106 hectares of
dryland cropping (mostly millet) in Niger generated an income
of about $70 per hectare. This difference in income per hectare
is in part a reflection of the quality of the food produced. The

"There are few assessments of how these changes could affect
local biodiversity. Mullié and Brouwer (1994), following Gibbs
(1993), suggest that small wetlands in the Sahel are important
for the metapopulation dynamics of certain taxa—meaning that
the loss of small wetlands may lead to a significant risk of
extinction for local populations of turtles and small birds (Gibbs,
1993). Taxa that are easily transported by wind or birds as adults,
eggs, cysts, larvae, and so forth would be subject to less risk
(Dumont, 1992; Mullié and Brouwer, 1994; Magadza, 1994).

"Higher temperatures also may adversely affect seedling emer-
gence of millet, the staple cereal over much of the Sahel (see
Monteith, 1981)—meaning that less millet would be harvested in
the dryland areas and increasing the pressure on wetlands.
However, during dry years in eastern Niger, infiltration into the
heavier soils in depressions may be so low that cropping becomes
unattractive (Reenberg, 1994). During dry years, water is more
limiting than nutrients, and cropping on less-fertile upland soils
with higher infiltration rates may become more attractive.

"Desertification upon drought may result in a loss of wetlands
due to moving sands (DDE-Tahoua, 1993; Mahamane Alio and
Abdou Halikou, 1993; Framine, 1994). In part, this response
can be related to the greater vulnerability of perennial vegeta-
tion to desiccation under a monomodal semi-arid rainfall
regime (Ellis and Galvin, 1994), when topsoil and seedbanks
are washed or blown away during the drought. Droughts may
make wetland vegetation more vulnerable to fires intended to
improve rangeland vegetation (Hutchinson et al., 1992).

approximately 20% of the total amount of organic carbon
stored in soils (see Section 6.3.3.2). A majority of this is in the
Northern Hemisphere as carbon stored in the form of peat (see
Box 6-2). Peat formation and accumulation in these wetlands
is influenced by climate change: A change in climate would
lead to changes in the flux of carbon (CO, and CH,) between
these ecosystems and the atmosphere, generating a feedback
on climate warming.

"Overall, these changes suggest that there will be less water in
most of the large rivers in the Sahel over the next 30-60 years,
with the exception of the major rivers flowing into Lake Chad.
This will mean less water available in the floodplains along
these rivers, unless there are changes to the management of
outflow from dams. Changes to the hydrology of the small wet-
lands will depend not only on climate change but also on
whether they are supplied with surface water or groundwater,
on the reaction of the natural vegetation, and on the extent of
cropping in their catchment areas.

"Recharge to shallow, unconfined groundwater could either
increase or decrease as a result of climate change. The ground-
water level in southwest Niger increased in the last decade
(Leduc et al., in press; Bromley et al., in press a), either as a
recovery from the droughts of 1983-84 and/or 1973-74 or as a
response to changes in land use. Annual recharge under millet
in southwest Niger is on the order of 1-200 mm, a factor ten
times greater than under bush and older fallow vegetation
(Gaze et al., in press; Bromley et al., in press b). Therefore, an
increase in the area sown for millet—as noted by Reenberg

"Possible impacts: Current scenarios suggest that climate change is likely to increase the flux of CO, to the atmosphere
because temperatures influence whether carbon litter is accumulated into the peat profile or oxidized. In addition, the
position of the water table regulates the extent of oxygen penetration into the peat profile. This means that drainage will
cause increased decomposition, leading to increased fluxes of CO, to the atmosphere, although this effect will decline
over time. Further, a decrease in water availability could lead to a decrease in CH, emissions from wetlands. Changes in
variables such as the areal extent of wetlands and the duration of the active period will determine whether there will be a
change in the total CH, flux from a wetland. A lowering of the water table would probably not affect nitrous oxide emis-
sions from bogs but could lead to an increase of emissions from fens, although emissions of nitrous oxide from wetlands
tend to be low.

"Wetland vegetation fixes CO, from the atmosphere and even-
tually is added to the top layers of the wetland soil as organic
litter. Part of the organic litter is oxidized and emitted as CO),
and some is accumulated as peat. Several investigations have
shown that soil CO, efflux from peatlands is strongly related to
temperature (Svensson et al., 1975; Svensson, 1980; Glenn et
al., 1993; Crill, 1991), although Moore (1986) found a poor
correlation between temperature and CO, emission rates. Since
most of the CO, emitted is produced by the upper soil layers
(Stewart and Wheatly, 1990), it mainly originates from organ-
ic material that has not yet become a part of the peat proper,
known as the catotelm. Carbon litter reaching the soil may be
either oxidized (emitted as CO,) or accumulated. Thus, a
change in CO, emissions will be directly correlated to the por-
tion of organic matter transferred to the catotelm. Because the
CH, formed will be accompanied by a nearly equal amount of
CO, (see Gujer and Zehnder, 1978), this relation should hold
for most peatland types.

"in peat accumulation in response to a temperature change.
Changes in hydrology also will influence the accumulation rate
of peat because the position of the water table regulates the
extent of oxygen penetration into the peat profile. The effect of
a lowered water table due to climate change can be compared
to the effects noted after drainage of peatlands for forest pro-
duction. Drainage results in an increased decomposition rate
and elevated fluxes of CO, to the atmosphere (Silvola et al.,
1985; Silvola, 1986; Moore and Knowles, 1989): A 25-cm low-
ering of the water table gave rise to a twofold increase in CO,
emissions from peat (Silvola et al., 1985; Moore and Knowles,
1989). Depending on the type of peatland, this elevated flux
may reduce carbon accumulation or even reverse the net flux
of carbon to make the peatland a net source of atmospheric
CO,. Drained minerotrophic forested peatlands have been
reported to respond in the latter way, whereas nutrient-poor
peatlands may continue to accumulate carbon at a predrainage
level (Laine et al., 1994; see also Tamm, 1951, 1965). Average
CO, evolution from northern peatlands has been estimated at
about 200 gC/m?/yr (Silvola et al., 1985; Moore 1986, 1989).
Following drainage, an elevated CO, flow will decline over
time (see Armentano and Menges, 1986) owing to substrate
depletion as the more easily decomposable fractions of the peat
become depleted. However, a drier climate will continue to
“drain” the peat successively for a long period; the decline will
occur later. To estimate the importance of this, it is assumed
that the drainage response reported by Silvola et al. (1985) is
linear with depth. The increase in CO, flows at subsequent
drawdowns of 5 cm would then be 40 gC/m?/yr or another 20%
per depth interval.

a qualitative assessment of CH, flux from northern wetlands

At present, it is not possible to obtain reliable quantitative esti-
mates of the change in flux because the surface hydrology of
general circulation models is too coarse to adequately represent
the small changes in moisture regime that probably affect the
CH, flux.

"this effect would be amplified in response to a decrease in soil
moisture. Thus, it is conceivable that the peat accumulation
rate will decrease to half of the present rate or even less (i.e.,
<0.025-0.055 Gt C/yr). Boreal peatlands may even become net
sources of atmospheric CO. In concluding his discussion of
the response of northern wetlands to predicted climate change,
Gorham (1991) gives the extreme example of a l-cm break-
down of the boreal peat layers worldwide. This would result in
2 Gt C/yr, which corresponds to more than a third of the pre-
sent release of carbon to the atmosphere via fossil fuel com-
bustion. The response in net primary production in relation to
climate change is more difficult to predict and may enhance or
reduce the effects caused by the estimated changes in the
degradation features of peatlands (see Malmer, 1992).

"Emissions of N,O from northern wetlands are low. In situ
chamber measurements and laboratory experiments with intact
peat cores have revealed emissions below 0.025 g N,O-
N/m2/yr (Urban et al., 1988; Freeman et al., 1993; Martikainen
et al., 1993), A lowering of the water table of bogs will not
affect their NO emissions, whereas it could strongly increase
emissions from fens. Annual emission rates in the range of
0.05-0.14 g N,O-N/m2/yr have been reported for drained peat
by Martikainen et al. (1993) and Freeman et al. (1993). The
difference between bogs and fens can be explained partly by
the fact that drained peat profiles of fens have the capacity to
nitrify (Lang et al., 1994). N,O emissions from drained boreal
fens are lower than those from drained agricultural organic
soils but 10-100 times higher than the rates from coniferous
forest soils (Martikainen et al., 1993).

the flux of CH, is intimately tied to the surface hydrology of
the wetland—which in turn is controlled by climate (precipita-

a CH,-oxidizing filter for CH, diffusing from the CH,-forming

"Much of the Kalimantan lowland area is subjected to a distinct
dry season from July to September or October in which there
are high water losses from wetlands as a result of direct evap-
oration and evapotranspiration. Thus, water levels drop and
peat oxidation occurs, with a net loss of carbon to the atmos-
phere. The spread of fire is one of the greatest threats to the
functioning of these wetlands. Peat fires occur frequently in the
region, creating palls of smoke sufficiently heavy to close local
airports. In 1983-84, fires destroyed 3.5 Mha of both diptero-
carp and peat swamp forest in Kalimantan, resulting in a direct
economic cost of $2-12 million and an incalculable ecological
cost (Maltby, 1986). The risk of fires spreading from cultivat-

increase if the dry season were extended.

species; both types are important as watersheds and habitats for valuable tree species. They also are carbon sinks but
release carbon into the atmosphere when water declines. The Kalimantan wetlands currently are stressed by the loss of
the natural ecosystem through deforestation, drainage, and agriculture. These activities limit the buffering capacity of
developed wetlands, causing changes that tend to be long-term and irreversible. However, these inland wetlands have
escaped some interference because most of the human settlements are located along the coastal zones.

"Background: The Everglades is a freshwater peatland dominated by sedge and sawgrass, with sloughs, wet prairies, and
tree islands. The Everglades is important as a habitat for wildlife, fish, and plant species and as a water source for the
neighboring community. It is estimated that drainage for agriculture and urban development in the past century has
resulted in a loss of more than half of the ecosystem, and the remaining wetlands have been altered by other construction
and so forth.
"	Text
"The most immediate effect of climate change will be acceler-
ated sea-level rise, resulting in saltwater intrusion into the
lower part of the glades from Florida Bay (Wanless et al.,
1994), Increased salinity would result in encroachment of salt-
tolerant wetland communities such as mangroves and salt
marshes. The areal extent of freshwater communities such as
sawgrass, slough, and wet prairie will decrease, and the amount
of organic carbon sequestered also will decrease. Another bio-
geochemical consequence of saltwater intrusion is a shift in
anaerobic decomposition away from methanogenesis toward
nitrate and sulfate reduction.
"	Text
"hydroperiod and nutrient regimes in the Everglades have
resulted in changes in the rate of peat accretion. Areas experi-
encing reduced hydrology (caused by overdrainage) exhibit
lower rates of accretion (1.6-2.0 mm/yr) compared to areas of
extended hydroperiod (2.8-3.2 mm/yr) (Craft and Richardson,
1993). Likewise, pollen analysis of peat cores indicates a
decrease in the extent of wetland vegetation such as sawgrass
and slough and a concurrent increase in terrestrial “weedy”
species (ragweed and pigweed) since drainage activities were
initiated (Bartow et al., 1994). Thus, future changes in the
Everglades ecosystem caused by global warming must be
interpreted in the context of recent anthropogenic alterations of
hydrology and nutrient regimes (see Box 6-4).
"	Text
"Possible impacts: Sea-level rise is expected to be perhaps the most important variable that will affect the Everglades,
causing saltwater intrusion that is likely to result in an encroachment of salt-tolerant wetland communities. This would
decrease the areal extent of the freshwater wetlands, with some effects on anaerobic decomposition. The increased evap-
otranspiration expected in some seasons would exacerbate this saltwater intrusion. Increased temperature is likely to
cause a northward migration of some introduced species but could be conducive for other species. Climate change also is
expected to affect the hydrology of the wetlands, causing higher water levels in the winter and lower levels in the sum-
mer. This could result in the loss of critical habitats such as sawgrass and wet prairie communities, although these losses
are likely to be offset by an increase in woody shrubs and trees.
"	Text
"The Everglades is a 500,000-hectare freshwater peatland domi-
nated by vast expanses of sedge and sawgrass, interspersed with
shallow-water aquatic communities (sloughs), wet prairies, and
tree islands (Loveless, 1959; Gunderson, 1994). Peat accumula-
tion and the subsequent formation of the Everglades began
approximately 5,000 years ago as sea-level rise slowed after an
initial rapid rise during deglaciation (Gleason and Stone, 1994).
As recently as a century ago, the Everglades encompassed more
than 1,000,000 hectares, but drainage for agriculture and urban
development has resulted in the loss of more than half of the
ecosystem (Kushlan, 1989; Davis et al., 1994). The remaining
area has been dramatically altered by construction of impound-
ments, canals, levees, and water-control structures; the system
is managed, primarily, as a water source (Light and Dineen,
1994), During the wet season (June-November), excess water
from agricultural land and suburban areas is pumped into the
Everglades; during the dry season (December—May), the
Everglades serves as a water source (DeGrove, 1984). In addi-
tion, approximately 50% of the water from the Kissimmee
River/Lake Okeechobee complex—the “headwaters” of the
Everglades—is diverted by canals to the Atlantic Ocean and the
Gulf of Mexico before recharging the wetland (Light and
Dineen, 1994). Thus, the present-day Everglades is character-
ized by a general reduction in the hydroperiod (Fennema et al.,
1994; Stephens, 1984; SFWMD, 1992; Walters et al., 1992).

"It is likely that the greatest impact of climate change will be the
loss of freshwater resources that sustain the burgeoning human
population of south Florida, as well as the unique Everglades
wetland. Competition for this diminishing resource will surely
result in a no-win situation for humans and the Everglades
under a scenario of global warming and rising sea level.

"On a positive note, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which
oversees the water resources of south Florida, is evaluating
modifications to the system of impoundments, canals, levees,
and water-control structures in order to restore the Everglades
(and other south Florida ecosystems) while providing for other
water-related needs in the region (U.S. ACOE, 1994). This
ambitious project, which could cost upward of $2 billion, is
designed to increase the spatial extent of wetlands and restore
the hydrology and water-quality conditions of the Everglades
and other south Florida ecosystems.

"further exacerbate saltwater intrusion into the Everglades.
Although more water will be lost to evapotranspiration, it is
likely that oxidation and subsidence of the peat soils will not
be dramatically affected because rising sea level will augment
the groundwater table, particularly in the southern Everglades.
Another consequence of increased temperature may be the
northward migration of introduced species such as Melaleuca
quinquenervia. Melaleuca, which has overtaken large areas of
the southern Everglades, is seemingly kept in check by frost
(Bodle ef al., 1994). However, increased temperatures caused
by climate change might enable Melaleuca to colonize large
areas of the northern Everglades.

"Precipitation is projected to decrease during summer (0-20%)
and increase during winter (0-20%). The winter months corre-
spond to the dry season (November—May), when approximate-
ly 25% (10-15 inches) of the 50 to 60 inches of annual rainfall
occurs (MacVicar and Lin, 1984). It is likely that an increase in
rainfall during this season will reduce the rate of drawdown
that normally occurs during this time. The reduction in summer
rainfall in the wet season (May—October) should result in a
lowering of the water table compared to current levels. These
combined seasonal changes in rainfall should dampen the
oscillations between the summer wet season and the winter dry
season. As a result, water levels in the Everglades probably will
be somewhat higher in the winter and somewhat lower in the
summer than they are at present.
"	Text
"A dampening of the annual hydroperiod fluctuation may result in
a decrease in the extent of sawgrass, the dominant plant commu-
nity in the Everglades. Sawgrass communities are partly main-
tained by fire (Gunderson, 1994); increased rainfall during the
dry season may reduce the frequency of fires—in particular, the
severe fires that occur in the beginning of the wet season (May)
that often burn large areas of the Everglades (Gunderson and
Snyder, 1994). It is likely that wet prairie communities also will
decrease in extent. These communities, which are important for-
aging habitat for wading birds (Hoffman et al., 1994), frequently
dry down during the spring (Goodrick, 1984). The dampening of
the annual hydroperiod fluctuations caused by global warming
will likely result in the loss of much of this critical habitat. The
decline of sawgrass and wet prairie communities probably will be
offset by an increase in woody shrubs and trees, These species are
not generally fire-tolerant and often compete more effectively
against emergents when water levels are stable.

"Site-specific responses are variable. There is a strong
need for a local and regional coupling of climate-change
predictions with known responses of specific wetlands,
which would allow for modeling of the necessary inter-
active responses of the hydroperiod, temperature, and
water availability at these scales. A network of different
wetland sites in different regions of the globe should be
established to form the base for such research.

The feedback on climate by changes in trace-gas
flows from wetlands, especially CO, and CH,, upon a
climate change calls for a strengthening of ongoing
research in this field. This will aid in the judgments
necessary for the introduction of adaptation and reme-
diation measures on wetlands.

The vast “grey” literature existing on different wet-
land subjects within the frames of local, regional, and
country research reports should be examined to fur-
ther substantiate site-specific responses by different
wetlands, including changes in species composition,
biogeochemistry, and socioeconomic consequences.

"More water will be released from regions with extensive
glaciers (High Confidence). In some semi-arid places
near high mountains, such as in central Asia and
Argentina, this glacial runoff may increase water
resources. In other places, summer water resources may
diminish as glaciers disappear (Medium Confidence).
In temperate mountain regions, reduced snow cover
will cause moderation of the seasonal flow regime of
rivers, so that winter runoff increases and spring
runoff decreases (Medium Confidence). Such
changes may benefit the hydroelectricity industry
(Medium Confidence).

Reduced snow cover and glaciers will detract from

"Many components of the cryosphere are sensitive to
changes in atmospheric temperature because of their
thermal proximity to melting. The extent of glaciers
has often been used as an indicator of past global tem-
peratures (High Confidence).

Projected warming of the climate will reduce the area
and volume of the cryosphere. This reduction will have
significant impacts on related ecosystems, associated
people, and their livelihoods (High Confidence).
There will be striking changes in the landscapes of
many high mountain ranges and of lands at northern
high latitudes (High Confidence). These changes may
be exacerbated where they are accompanied by grow-
ing numbers of people and increased economic activ-
ity (Medium Confidence).

"Obvious thinning, mass-loss, and retreat of mountain
glaciers (High Confidence): The extent of alpine ice
in the European Alps probably is more reduced today
than at any time during the past 5,000 years.

Later freeze-up and earlier break-up dates for river

at least a week different compared to last century

No convincing evidence of trends in Antarctic or

"The cryosphere, which represents all global snow, ice, and per-
mafrost, contains nearly 80% of all freshwater. It includes season-
al snow, mountain glaciers, ice caps, ice sheets, seasonally frozen
soils, permafrost, river ice, lake ice, and sea ice (Table 7-1).
Permafrost underlies as much as 25% of the global land surface.
Seasonal snow has the largest area of any component of the cryos-
phere; at its maximum in late winter it covers almost 50% of the
land surface of the Northern Hemisphere. A huge proportion of the
mass of the cryosphere is contained in ice sheets, but at time scales
of a century or less they are least sensitive to climate change.

"Mass loss and retreat of glaciers is common in many mountain
areas of the world. Oerlemans (1994) looks at glacial retreat on
a global level, using a scaling system to classify different glac-
iers. He concludes that during the period 1884-1978, mean
global glacial retreat corresponded to a calculated warming of
0.66 + 0.10°C per century. Chapter 7, Changes in Sea Level, of
the Working Group I volume suggests that glaciers have lost
sufficient ice over the last 100 years to raise sea level by 0.2-0.4
mm/yr. Recent analyses by Oerlemans and Fortuin (1992),
Meier (1993), and Dyurgerov (1994) all show negative global
ice-mass balances during this century. Although the glacial sig-
nal appears homogeneous at the global scale, there is great vari-
ability at local and regional scales and over shorter time periods
of years to decades (Letréguilly and Reynaud, 1989).

1983. In South America, the Upsala glacier has retreated about
60 m/yr over the last 60 years, and this rate seems to be accel-

Patagonian Ice Field has diminished by about 500 km? from
13,500 km2 in 41 years. Surface lowering also has been con-

Tyndall Glacier (one of the southernmost outlet glaciers) low-
ered by 20 m between 1985 and 1990 (a rate of 4.0 m/yr),

water stored as seasonal snow declines as temperature increas-

ature than to increases. As precipitation increases, snow accu-
mulation becomes less sensitive to temperature changes. The
volume of water stored also depends on catchment hypsome-
try. In Australia, the duration of snow cover is found to be very
sensitive to changes in temperature. Large increases in precip-

"Most glaciers of the world are more sensitive to changes in tem-
perature than to any other climatic element. In the case of many
Asian glaciers, where precipitation occurs mainly during the
summer monsoon season, temperature has a double impact. The
first impact is an increase in the absorption of solar radiation
due to a lowering of the surface albedo as snowfall is convert-
ed to rainfall. The second effect is an increase in the energy
exchange between the atmosphere and the glacier surface
(Ageta and Kadota, 1992). Many maritime glaciers, which have
large mass turnover, are more sensitive to changes in precipita-
tion than to temperature. This complex dependence of glacier
mass balance on temperature, precipitation, and radiation

inlets in the Arctic; along the open coast in shallow water; and
in channels of restricted dimensions—is correlated to the num-
ber of degree-days of freezing since the beginning of winter. In
pack ice, however, the relationship between ice extent or ice
thickness and temperature is less clear. Chapman and Walsh
(1993) report that there is a statistically significant decrease in
Arctic sea-ice extent in winter correlated with atmospheric
warming, but there are no trends in winter Arctic ice extent or

Riseborough and Smith (1993) suggest that the rate of thaw
and ultimate disappearance of a relatively thin (4.5 m) per-
mafrost profile is highly dependent on the interannual variabil-

mate change is documented in the former Soviet Union and
China, where the permafrost distribution changed substantially
during warmer periods of the Quaternary (Kondratjeva et al.,
1993; Qiu and Cheng, 1995). The southern limit of lowland
permafrost moved at 60 km/°C (Cui and Xie, 1984). In the
alpine permafrost of Tibet, the lower elevation changed by 160
m/°C (Cui, £980). On the northern slope of the Himalayas, the

valuable for regions in which they have been developed, they
are not always applicable to other mountain areas with different
climate and terrain. The sensitivity of glacier ablation has been
assessed for number of melting degree-days (dd) for a range of
glaciers by Braithwaite and Olesen (1989, 1990, 1993).
Ablation sensitivity for ice varies from 5.5 to 7.6 mm/dd
(Braithwaite and Oleson, 1989). Values for snow range from 1.0
to 5.7 mm/dd (Johannesson et al., 1993). Hydrometeorological
models are similar but include precipitation as well as tempera-
ture; they also usually estimate the mass balance (e.g., Woo and
Fitzharris, 1992) and sometimes the water balance (e.g.,
Tangborn, 1980). Energy-balance models also have been used
to assess the sensitivity of glacier ablation to climate
(Oerlemans, 1991; Oerlemans et al., 1993); they are appealing
because they are more physically based, but they require input
parameters that are difficult to obtain.

effects of air temperatures and solar radiation. Permafrost also
is influenced indirectly by local factors, many of which also
have a climate component. These include the thickness and
duration of snow cover, the type of vegetation, the properties
of the organic layer and soil, and the characteristics of running
water (Harris and Corte, 1992; Schmitt, 1993). These factors
interact in complex ways, making it difficult to asses the sensi-

(Koster, 1991, 1994; Koster and Nieuwenhuijzen, 1992; Koster

warming usually causes an increase in the thickness of the
active layer via melting at the permafrost table (the active layer
is the zone of annual freezing and thawing above permafrost).

with circulation changes induced by three large El Nifio events.
In the first half of the 20th century, warming accounted for
most of the ice thinning observed on Mount Kenya. However,
from 1963 to 1987, greater atmospheric humidity was instru-
mental in enhancing melt—perhaps a consequence of
enhanced evaporation in the Indian Ocean and its subsequent
advection over East Africa by the prevailing atmospheric cir-
culation patterns (Hastenrath, 1992, 1994; Hastenrath and
Kruss, 1992). In the Canadian High Arctic, mass-balance and
ice-core melt studies show that when the circumpolar vortex
shifts to the Asian side of the Arctic Ocean and the North
American trough is replaced by a blocking ridge, high-arctic
glaciers experience high melt (Alt, 1987).

they are in balance or have decreased or increased in volume over the last 100 years (see Chapter 7, Changes in Sea

small icebergs before enormous pieces break off (Orheim, 1988). For example, giant icebergs have calved from the
Filchner, Larsen, Ross, and Shackleton Ice Shelves in recent years. The northerly Wordie Ice Shelf may be systematical-

mass could have melted. The scenarios of Greco et al. (1994)
indicate that some mountain areas will experience an increase
in precipitation. Because models demonstrate that increases in
temperature usually dominate changes in precipitation, mass
balances of glaciers will become negative rather than positive.
Glaciers are likely to shrink even where mountains become

the extra runoff may persist for a century or more and may pro-
vide a substantial increase to regional water resources. As the
area of ice eventually diminishes, glacial runoff will wane.
Tentative estimates have been made for Central Asia
(Kotlyakov et al., 1991) based on mass balances from a small
number of Tien Shan glaciers for the period 1959-1992.
Extrapolation to the whole of Central Asia suggests glacier
mass has decreased by 804 km3 over that time, representing a
15% increase in glacial runoff. Projections to 2100 are pre-
sented in Table 7-2; these data assume that glacial runoff varies

cover within decades, Haeberli and Hoelzle (1995), who have

Nevertheless, the largest alpine glaciers—-such as those found
around the Gulf of Alaska and in Patagonia, Karakoram, Pamir,
Tien Shan, and the Himalayas—should continue to exist into
the 22nd century. At high altitudes and high latitudes, glaciers
and ice caps may change little in size, but warming of cold firn
areas will be pronounced. Their mass balance may be affected
through enhanced ablation at low altitudes, while accumulation
at higher zones could increase. As an analog, Miller and de

extent of this shift depends on location. Less snow will accu-
mulate at low elevations, but there may be more above the
freezing level from any increased precipitation. Martinec et al.
(1994) and Rango and Martinec (1994) have examined the
behavior of a snowmelt-runoff model in various catchments for

indirect effects (see Chapter 10).

"growth and thickness would be reduced. In colder regions, the
present ice season could be shortened by up to a month by 2050.
Warmer winters would cause more mid-winter break-ups as
rapid snowmelt, initiated particularly by rain-on-snow events,
becomes more common. Warmer spring air temperatures may
affect break-up severity, but the results would be highly site-
specific because break-up is the result of a complex balancing
between downstream resistance (ice strength and thickness) and
upstream forces (flood wave). Although thinner ice produced by
a warmer winter would tend to promote a thermal break-up, this
might be counteracted to some degree by the earlier timing of
the event, reducing break-up severity (Prowse et al., 1990).

"If the warming of the 1980s continues unabated over the next
10-20 years, ice cover on the Great Lakes of North America
will likely be similar to or less than that during the 1983 ice
season, which was one of the mildest winters of the past 200
years. Mid-lake ice cover did not form, and ice duration and
thickness were less than normal (Assel et al., 1985). Complete
freezing will become increasingly infrequent for larger and
deeper embayments in the Great Lakes. The duration of ice
cover will decrease as freeze-up dates occur later and ice-loss
dates occur earlier. Winters without freeze-up will begin to
occur at small inland fakes in the region. Winter lake evapora-
tion also may increase due to the decreased ice cover.

"Using empirical ice growth-melt models, Wadhams (1990b)
predicts that in the Northwest Passage and Northern Sea Route,
acentury of warming would lead to a decline in winter fast-ice
thickness from 1.8-2.5 m at present to 1.4-1.8 m and an
increase in the ice-free season of 41-100 days. This effect will
be of great importance for the extension of the navigation sea-
son in the Russian Northern Sea Route and the Northwest
Passage. A possible feedback with snow thickness may alter
these relationships. As Arctic warming increases open-water
area, precipitation may increase and cause thicker snow cover.
The growth rate of land fast ice will decrease, as has been
directly observed (Brown and Cote, 1992). But if snow thick-
ness is increased to the point where not all ice is melted in sum-
mer, then the protection that it offers the ice surface from sum-
mer melt could lead to an increase, rather than decrease, in
equilibrium ice thickness.
"	Text
"Predicting future thickness of moving pack ice is a difficult
problem, because dynamics (ocean and wind currents), rather
than thermodynamics (radiation and heat components), deter-
mine its area-averaged mean thickness. Wind stress acting on
the ice surface causes the ice cover to open up to form leads.
Later under a convergent stress, refrozen leads and thinner ice
elements are crushed to form pressure ridges. Exchanges of
heat, salt and momentum are all different from those that
would occur in a fast ice cover. The effects of variable thick-
ness are very important. The area-averaged growth rate of ice
is dominated (especially in autumn and early winter when
much lead and ridge creation take place) by the small fraction
of the sea surface occupied by ice less than 1 m thick. In fast
ice, climatic warming will increase sea-air heat transfer by
reducing ice growth rates. However, over open leads a warm-
ing will decrease the sea-air heat transfer, so the area-averaged
change in this quantity over moving ice (hence its feedback
effect on climatic change itself) depends on the change in the
rate of creation of new lead area. This is itself a function of a
change in the ice dynamics, either driving forces (wind field)
or response (ice rheology). Hibler (1989) pointed out a further
factor relevant to coastal zones of the Arctic Ocean, such as off
the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, where there is net conver-
gence and the mean thickness is very high (7 m or more) due
to ridging. Here the mean thickness is determined by mechan-
ical factors, largely the strength of the ice, and is likely to be
insensitive to global warming.

"Revegetation of terrain following deglaciation is slow in high-mountain areas. This leaves morainic deposits unprotected
against erosion for extended time periods (decades to centuries). There will be increased sediment loads in alpine rivers
and accelerated sedimentation in lakes and artificial reservoirs at high altitude. On slopes steeper than about 25-30
degrees, stability problems, such as debris flows, will develop in freshly exposed or thawing non-consolidated sediments.

"An identical argument applies to salt flux, which is positive
into the upper ocean in ice growth areas and negative in melt
areas. Salt is transported northward via the southward (Lemke
et al., 1990) ice drift. A relative increase in area-averaged melt
would cause increased stabilization of the upper layer of polar
surface water, and hence a reduction in heat flux by mixing
across the pycnocline. A relative increase in freezing would
cause destabilization and possible overturning and convection.

"suppose that the main effect of global warming will be a sim-

(1990) has demonstrated that even here, a complex set of feed-
back mechanisms comes into play when the air temperature
changes. The balance of lead concentration, upper ocean struc-
ture and pycnocline depth adjusts itself to minimize the impact
of changes, tending to preserve an ice cover even though it may
be thinner and more diffuse.

"Shrinkage of permafrost and snow cover will eliminate snow metamorphism, and avalanche formation in high mountain
regions and adjacent lowlands (Keller and Gubler, 1993; Tenthorey, 1992). An increased frequency of catastrophic snow
avalanches may occur if sudden cold spells and a mixture of cold and warm air masses are more common in late winter, or if
periods of rapid warming are accompanied by heavy rain follow periods of intensive snowfalls. There is insufficient evidence
to indicate whether the frequency of such events will change. Avalanches are expected to be less of a hazard than at present.
"	Text
"The empirical basis for assessing alpine hazard probabilities comes from historical documents, statistics of measured time
series or traces in nature of past events with long recurrence intervals. A future problem is that these will lose more and
more of their significance as climate changes. This is because floods, avalanches, debris flows, and rock falls could have

different magnitudes and frequencies than in the present climate, as the condition of the cryosphere in high mountain
areas evolves beyond the range of Holocene and historical variability.

"If ice were to retreat entirely from the central gyre region of the
Greenland Sea, it may cause deep convection to cease. Already
there is evidence from tracer studies (Schlosser et al., 1991) of
a marked reduction in the renewal of the deep waters of the
Greenland Sea by convection during the last decade. It is not
known whether this is part of a natural variation, or a response
due to greenhouse warming. If continued, it could have a pos-
itive feedback effect on global warming, since the ability of the
world ocean to sequestrate carbon dioxide through convection
is reduced. Given the complexity of these interactions and
feedbacks, it is not at all clear what the overall effect of an air
temperature increase on the Arctic ice cover and upper ocean
will be. Sensitivity studies using coupled ocean-ice-atmos-
phere models are required, but results are not yet available.

"At places of pronounced glacier retreat, changes in stress distribution and surface temperature conditions in rock walls of
deeply cut glacier troughs must also be anticipated, so that massive rock slides will occur in the deglaciated valley
(Clague and Evans, 1992, 1994; Evans and Clague, 1993, 1994). Steep hanging glaciers which are partially or entirely
frozen to their beds could become less stable. On the other hand, some steep glacier tongues with present-day potential
for large ice avalanches will disappear. Lakes dammed by landslides, moraines and glaciers can drain suddenly and pro-
duce floods or debris flows orders of magnitude larger than normal stream flow. Processes related to ice retreat such as
glacier avalanches, slope instability caused by debuttressing, and glacier floods from moraine or ice-dammed lakes may
pose hazards to people, transport routes, and economic infrastrucure in mountain areas. The general tendency in high
mountains will be an upslope shifting of hazard zones and widespread reduction in stability of formerly glaciated or
perennially frozen slopes (Barsch, 1993; Haeberli, 1992; Gu et al., 1993; Dutto and Mortara, 1992).

rivers along the southern margin of the Arctic, regions of

the vegetation will likely be different from today. When the
lichens and mosses, that tend to be suppressors of evapotran-
spiration, are replaced by transpiring plants, evaporative losses
will increase. Enhanced evaporation will lower the water table,
followed by changes in the peat characteristics as the extensive
wetland surfaces become drier (Woo, 1992).

"In permafrost regions, increased thawing deepens the active
layer, allowing greater infiltration and water storage, especial-
ly for rain that falls during the thawed period. Warming of the
ground will also lead to the formation of unfrozen zones with-
in the permafrost which provide conduits for groundwater
flow. The chemical composition and the amount of groundwa-
ter discharge may be changed as sub-permafrost or intra-per-
mafrost water is connected to the surface. In autumn and win-
ter, more groundwater should be available to maintain base-
flow, further extending the streamflow season.
"	Text
"A ccritical factor influencing the response of tundra to warming depends on the presence of ground ice. Ground ice is
generally concentrated in the upper 10 meters of permafrost, the very layers that will thaw first as permafrost degrades.
This loss is effectively irreversible, because once the ground ice melts, it cannot be replaced for millenia, even if the cli-
mate were to subsequently cool. Response of the permafrost landscape to warming will be profound, but will vary great-
ly at the local scale, depending on detail of ground ice content. As substantial ice in permafrost is melted, there will be
land subsidence. This process of thermokarst erosion will create many ponds and lakes and lead to coastal retreat.
"	Text
"Less snow and glacier ice will influence the seasonality of river
flow by reducing meltwater production in the warm season.
The expected smoothing of the annual runoff amplitude could
be both beneficial (e.g., energy production in winter, reduction
of summer flood peaks) and adverse (e.g., reduced water sup-
ply for summer irrigation in dry areas, more frequent winter
floods). As mountain glaciers begin to disappear, then eventu-
ally the volume of summer runoff will be reduced due to the
loss of ice resources. Consequences for downstream agricul-
ture, which relies on this water for irrigation, are in some
places very unfavourable. For example, low and midland parts
of Central Asia are likely to gradually change into a more arid,
interior desert.

"A forerunner of future landscapes can be seen in areas of massive ground ice, such as in Russia, where past climatic
warming has altered the landscape by producing extensive flat-bottomed valleys, Ponds within an area of thermokarst
topography eventually grow into thaw lakes. These continue to enlarge for decades to centuries, due to wave action and
continued thermal erosion of the banks. Liquefaction of the thawed layer will result in mudflows on slopes in terrain that
is poorly drained or that contains ice-rich permafrost. On steeper slopes there will also be landslides (Lewkowicz, 1992).
Winter discharge of groundwater often leads to ice formation, and this is expected to increase on hillslopes and in the
stream channels of the tundra.

Eurasia. They depend directly on the living resources of the area and often travel on ice, so their livelihood may be
widely affected. Ice roads and crossings are commonly used to link northern settlements. The greatest economic impact
is likely to stem from decreases in ice thickness and bearing capacity, which « could severely restrict the size and load
limit of vehicular traffic (Lonergan et al., 1993). There is likely to be a change i in the migration patterns of polar bears

associated with the release of sufficient flow to avoid the
downstream freeze-off of a major tributary (Foulds, 1988).
Major economic savings are likely if the length of the ice sea-

in damages from such events depend on how climate change
affects the frequency and severity of river-ice freeze-up and
break-up events. Less river ice and a shorter ice season in
northward flowing rivers of Canada, Russia and Siberia should
enhance north-south river transport. When combined with less
sea ice in the Arctic, new opportunites for reorganization of
transport networks and trade links will arise. Ultimately those
changes could affect trading patterns among Russia, USA,
Canada, northern Europe, and Japan.

"Where climate change alters the river-ice regime, substantial
effects on the hydrology can be expected that will affect flow,
water levels, and storage. For cold continental rivers, many
hydrologic extremes, such as low flows and floods, are fre-
quently more a function of ice effects than landscape runoff. At
freeze-up, the hydraulic resistance of an accumulating cover
can induce sufficiently large hydraulic storage that the river
flow falls below that normally expected (Gerard, 1990; Gray
and Prowse, 1993), Projected climates will delay the timing of
freeze-up and so prolong the autumn low flow period. At
break-up, the rapid hydraulic storage and release of water by
river-ice jams often forms the most significant hydrologic
event of the year. Break-up flood levels typically exceed those
that develop during the open-water period, even though actual
discharge of water is lower. The impact of climatic warming
will be to advance the timing of break, but its effect on break-
up flooding is not clear.

the permafrost zone in China contains more than 3,000 km of
railway and over 13,000 km of highway. Thawing induced by
climate warming will result in serious disruption and
increased maintenance costs from ground subsidence, side-

spend less money on snow and ice clearance. Engineering
design criteria will need to be modified to reflect changing
snow and frost climates, deepening of the active layer over
permafrost, and warming and ultimate disappearance of mar-
ginal or discontinuous permafrost. Present pérmafrost engi-
neering commonly designs for the warmest year in the past 20
years of record (Esch, 1993). Such criteria may need to be

occur with climatic warming will increase opportunities for
shipping there and open up new trade routes. The effect of
annual warming on ice calving, simulated using a simple degree
day model (Brown, 1993) shows that for every 1°C of warming
there would be a 1° latitude retreat of the iceberg occurrence in
the Atlantic Ocean. In the Southern Ocean, any effects of
reduced sea ice will be economically less pronounced.

"Climatic scenarios produced by GCMs need to be
refined so as to provide more detail for mountain and

where snow, ice, and permafrost are dominant needs
to be better verified for the present climate. Imprecise
estimates of future polar and alpine precipitation, and
particularly snow depth, are a major constraint in pre-
dicting the behavior of most components of the
cryosphere and their impact.

Research should focus on processes that are driven by
interactions between the atmosphere and the cryos-
phere. Improving understanding of these processes
would allow the construction of more sophisticated
and realistic climate sensitivity models.

Monitoring of key components of the cryosphere must
continue. The mass balance of the ice sheets of the
world is poorly known. Databases need to be further

uptake by the oceans.

The oceans’ uptake and storage capacity for greenhouse
gases will be affected further by changes in nutrient

precipitation, runoff, and atmospheric deposition.
Freshwater influx from the movements and melting of
sea ice or ice sheets may lead to a weakening of the
global thermohaline circulation, causing unpredictable

"Redistribution of SST could cause geographical shifts
in biota as well as changes in biodiversity, and in
polar regions the extinction of some species and pro-
liferation of others. A rise in mean SST in high lati-
tudes should increase the duration of the growing
period and the productivity of these regions if light
and nutrient conditions remain constant.

Sea-level changes will occur from thermal expansion
and melting of ice, with regional variations due to
dynamic effects resulting from wind and atmospheric
pressure patterns, regional ocean density differences,
and oceanic circulation.

Changes in the magnitude and temporal pattern of
pollutant loading in the coastal ocean will occur as a
result of changes in precipitation and runoff.

"No adaptive responses to coral bleaching, even on a
regional scale, will be available if average global
temperature increases 2°C by 2050. However, reduc-
tions in land-based pollution of the marine environ-
ment, combined with reductions in habitat degrada-
tion/destruction, would produce benefits for fisheries,
aquaculture, recreation, and tourism.

Adaptation options will be available for the offshore
oil, gas, and shipping industries if the frequency of
tropical storms and hurricanes increases. The options
include improved design standards for offshore struc-
tures, national and international regulations for ship-
ping, and increased technological capabilities to pro-
vide early warning at sea. Governments also can
increase attention to institutional design for planning
and responding to disasters and acute emergencies.
Where climate change generates positive effects, mar-
ket-driven needs will create their own adaptation dynam-
ic. However, adaptation policies will be required to con-
trol externalities that are market failures. For instance,
opening up both the Northwest Passage and the Russian
Northern Sea Route for up to 100 days a year—while a
boon to international shipping and consumers in East
Asia, North America, and Western Europe—will have to
be accompanied by policies designed to. limit the total
burden of pollutants entering the Arctic environment
from ports, ship operations, and accidents.

"Just less than 60% of the Earth’s radiative energy from the Sun
is received by the ocean, 80% of which is absorbed in the top
10 m of the ocean. Winds and waves mix down a seasonal sur-
face layer of nearly uniform temperature, salinity, and other
properties. This layer extends to tens of meters in the tropics
and to several hundred meters in high-latitude seas, where
oceanic convections are due to the annual cooling of surface

"waters and where the winds are stronger and the waves larger.
The permanent thermocline lies below the seasonal surface
layer, down to about 1000 m depth. Circulation down to the
upper thermocline is principally wind-driven and is character-
ized by basin-scale gyres and intensive western boundary cur-
rents such as the Gulf Stream and the Kuroshio. The oceans
transport about the same amount of heat poleward as the
atmosphere (Trenberth and Solomon, 1994), and these western
boundary currents are the most important carriers.

"The oceans function as regulators of the Earth’s climate and
sustain planetary biogeochemical cycles. They also are of sig-
nificant socioeconomic value as suppliers of resources and
products, as sinks for wastes, as areas of recreation and
tourism, as a medium for transportation, and as a repository of
genetic and biological information. To gain a perspective of the
oceans’ importance, consider that the global ocean industry (all
sectors) realizes about 4% of world gross national product
(GNP)—approximately $20 trillion in 1988 (Broadus, 1991).
"	Text
"The oceans have significant capacity to store heat and are the
largest reservoir of the two most important greenhouse gases—
water vapor and carbon dioxide (CO,). The long timescales of
vertical circulation in the oceans result in slow turnover of
stored heat and CO,. The properties of oceans are affected by
variability resulting from Sun-Earth orbital changes (e.g., sea-
sonal and Milankovitch cycles); interactions among compo-
nents of the climate system—for example, the atmosphere-
cryosphere—modulate these variations and result in climatic
variability on other timescales.

"The lower thermocline and the abyssal ocean represent nearly
90% of the volume of the oceans, and most of this water is
colder than 5°C. It is dominated by thermohaline circulation
driven by differences in density. Globally, the oceanic thermo-
haline circulation can provide a substantial buffer against
greenhouse warming. It incorporates both heat and CO, from
the atmosphere at higher latitudes and releases them at lower
latitudes decades or centuries later. Thus, it plays an important
role in controlling the distribution of both heat and greenhouse
gases and, as a consequence, modulating global climate.
"	Text
"About 57% of oceanic volume is colder than 2°C. Except for the
Arctic Ocean and the nearby part of the Atlantic Ocean, these
characteristics can only be derived from Antarctic bottom water
(Gordon, 1991). Therefore, a significant part of global thermo-
haline circulation is driven by the formation and sinking of
Antarctic bottom water, principally in the Weddel Sea. As a con-
sequence, the Antarctic Ocean is quite important for the global
climate, but its role in contributing variability to climate is not
understood. Further, changes in the formation of deep water in
the North Atlantic are usually considered to be part of the
- processes by which the Earth moves from an ice age to an inter-
glacial and back again. This process is explained in Box 8-1.

"In this chapter, we attempt to assess the impacts of projected
regional and global climate changes on the oceans. Climate
change will affect the physical, biological, and biogeochemical
characteristics of the oceans at different time and space scales,
which should modify their ecological structure and functions
and is expected to exert significant feedback controls on the
climate system. These caanges will be in addition to human
activities such as land-use changes, industrialization and
urbanization, increased food production, habitat modification,
transportation of exotic organisms, and releases of pollutants.
The present trends of increasing pollution, development, and
overuse are reducing the capacity of coastal oceans and semi-
enclosed seas to respond to and compensate for environmental
changes that might be brought about by a climate change
(GESAMP, 1990).

"Studies of gases trapped in polar ice cores have shown that the
concentration of atmospheric CO, has undergone variations
that parallel climatic changes (Barnola et al., 1987). The strong
correlation between variations of polar temperature and atmos-
pheric carbon dioxide concentration in comparison with the
Sun-Earth orbit-induced glacial-interglacial cycles strongly
suggests the existence of feedback mechanisms involving the
interplay of biological, chemical, and physical processes
(Watson et al., 1990). Because the ocean contains about 60
times more carbon than the atmosphere (Sundquist and
Broecker, 1985), variations in atmospheric CO, could resuit
from even minor changes in the ocean’s physicochemical and
biogeochemical characteristics affecting carbon cycling in the
sea. Among the proposed explanations for the variability of
atmospheric CO, contents on these timescales are changes in
ocean productivity (Sarnthein et al., 1988) and fluctuations in
the quantity of carbon stored in the deep sea—which in turn,
are related to changes in ocean circulation (Boyle and Keigwin,
1982; Curry et al., 1988).

"The “conveyor belt” global thermohaline circulation is driven primarily by the formation and sinking of deep water
(from 1500 m to the Antarctic bottom water overlying the bottom of the ocean) in the Norwegian Sea (Figure 8-1;
Broecker, 1991). This circulation is thought to be responsible for the large flow of upper ocean water from the tropical
Pacific to the Indian Ocean through the Indonesian Archipelago—the Indonesian Throughflow (e.g., Broecker, 1991).
"	Text
"The North Atlantic atmosphere-ocean-cryosphere system appears to have natural cycles of many timescales in switching
the conveyor belt. In these cycles, sea ice plays a pivotal role. Periodic movement of excessive sea ice from the Arctic
into the Greenland Sea appears to be responsible for the interdecadal variability of the conveyor belt (Mysak et al.,
1990), characterized by the freshening of the intermediate water (Dickson et al., 1988). There is no evidence yet that the
influx of interdecadal switching extends beyond the North Atlantic Ocean.
"	Text
"The global conveyor belt thermohaline circulation is controlled by two counteracting forcings operating in the North
Atlantic. The thermal forcing (high-latitude cooling and low-latitude heating) drives a poleward surface flow, and the
haline forcing (net high-latitude freshwater gain and low-latitude evaporation) moves in the opposite direction. In today’
North Atlantic, the thermal forcing dominates. When the strength of the haline forcing increases due to excess precipita-
tion, runoff, and/or ice melt, the conveyor belt will weaken (i.e., decrease in both poleward warm surface flow and deep:
water formation) or even shut down. The variability in the strength of the conveyor belt will lead to climate change in
Europe. Climatic variation in other parts of the global ocean also may be influenced by the variability of the conveyor
belt (e.g., Gordon et al., 1992; Lehman, 1993). Numerical simulations of global ocean circulation show that small
changes in the external forcing at high latitudes can switch off the present conveyor belt and force the ocean to reach
another equilibrium state, in which the Antarctic Circumpolar Front represents the sole deep-water source (e.g., Maier-
Reimer et al., 1993).

These variations may be related to the strength of the “conveyor belt.” When the conveyor belt is strong, as in the present, the
North Atlantic polar front (i.e., the circulation boundary between cold polar and warm boreal water masses) swings open,
allowing warm subtropical water masses to flow on to the north (bottom left). During the last glacial period, the conveyor belt
was rapidly weakened many times due to iceberg surges (triangles in bottom right). Then the polar front swung to the east, cutting
off the northward flow of warm waters (after Bond et al., 1993; Zahn, 1994).

"thought to be the driving mechanism (Bond et al., 1993). These millennial cycles, called Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles,
appear to lump into long-term cooling cycles (Dansgaard et al., 1993; Oeschger et al., 1984). Each cooling cycle culmi-
nates in an enormous discharge of icebergs into the North Atlantic from massive collapses of Laurentinide ice sheets—
called a Heinrich event—followed by an abrupt shift to a warmer climate. The Younger Dryas—an event that happened
at the last glacial termination about 11,000 years ago, when there were abrupt temperature decreases in Greenland and
Northern Europe—also was a Heinrich event. Similar observations also have been made in the Greenland ice-core
record from the last interglacial period (GRIP Project Members, 1993). In as much as the last interglacial seems to have
been slightly warmer than the present one, global warming may destabilize the relatively stable climate that the Earth
has experienced over the past 8000 years (GRIP Project Members, 1993). There is some doubt, however, about the reli-
ability of the Greenland ice-core record for the last interglacial (e.g., Broecker, 1994). If the last interglacial climate
variability did exist, it could have been due to an origin different from fluctuations in the strength of the conveyor belt

fossil fuel use and tropical deforestation between 1980 and 1989
(Siegenthaler and Sarmiento, 1993), thus slowing the rate of
greenhouse global warming. The same estimate also leaves
about 25% of the emissions unaccounted for. This “missing
sink” for carbon dioxide is thought to be located in the terrestri-

through advection, evaporation (E), precipitation (P), and—in
higher latitudes—the solid-ice phase will be affected by
changes in wind systems and oceanic current systems. The
freshwater budget of the ocean is still not well enough under-
stood, primarily because of the lack of adequate data, although
Schmitt et al. (1989) have given some preliminary assess-
ments. Atmosphere-ocean interactions maintaining the overall
E-P balance will be affected by changes in circulation, evapo-
ration, precipitation, and the availability of precipitable water
in the atmosphere over the ocean. A changing pattern of rain-

"The newest class of marine organisms that appears to have con-

‘the hyperthermophiles (T,,, > 85°C) (Kristjansson, 1989).
These bacteria live at extremes of pH and temperature that
make them attractive to industry. because, among other charac-

solvents and harsh purification processes. Large colonies of
hyperthermophiles now have been found at spreading centers
in mid-ocean ridges (Jannasch and Wirsen, 1979), in the deep
North Sea, and in Alaskan oil reservoirs (Stetter et al., 1993).
However, they are difficult to culture in the laboratory. Not sur-
prisingly, the potential value and availability of these hyper-

for industrial applications by biotechnology firms (e.g., Myers

"Living resources include fish and shellfish, marine mam-
mals, and seaweeds. In 1990, the world’s fish catch was 97
million tons (mt)—14 mt from inland sources and 83 mt
from marine sources (FAO, 1992a). However, the annual rate
of growth in world marine catch has been declining since
1972 (FAO, 1992b). This decline in the rate of growth, and
decline in overall production experienced in 1990, is the
combined result of uncontrolled growth in fishing effort and
overfishing of important stocks in the Atlantic Ocean.
Uncontrolled access to resources and growth in fishing effort
supported by large national subsidies are major weaknesses
in the world fisheries system as a whole (see Chapter 16). In
contrast, the production trend in the world aquaculture
industry is the opposite of that in the marine capture fisheries
industry. Between 1984 and 1992, world aquaculture pro-
duction increased 89% and amounted to 23% of the world
marine catch with a value of $32.5 billion (in 1992 U.S.$)
(Aquaculture Magazine Buyers Guide, 1995). This subject is

"Acombination of human activities (e.g., overfishing, pollution
of estuaries and the coastal ocean, and the destruction of habi-
tat, especially wetlands and seagrasses) currently exerts a far
more powerful effect on world marine fisheries than is expect-
ed from climate change. However, fisheries are indeed sensi-
tive to climate change as inferred from paleorecords. The
Working Group I report concludes that because marine photo-
synthesis is limited by nitrogen rather than by carbon, increas-
ing CO, contents in the upper ocean is unlikely to have a pos-
itive impact on net primary productivity. Rather, primary pro-
ductivity should respond to changes in nutrient availability
resulting from changes in ocean circulation, runoff input, or
atmospheric deposition. Because there is substantial uncer-
tainty about whether any of these factors will change with
global warming, it is not clear if average primary productivity
will be affected. Even if global average primary productivity
is negatively affected, there are so many pathways and loops
in the chain between primary productivity and upper trophic
level species—including a significant microbial loop—and
regional conditions vary so widely that it is difficult to say
whether reductions in the average yield of commercial fish-
eries will result.

below the thermocline is quite large. This technique, called
ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC), theoretically can be
applied in the latitude belt between 20°N and 20°S, but the area
of greatest potential lies between 10°N and 10°S. Total poten-
tial electricity production from OTEC ranges between 108 and
10!0 MW (Charlier and Justus, 1993), An upper limit per plant
at the 107 MW level would amount to 299 quads per year [one
quad = 1015 Btu (British thermal units)] of electric energy. So
far, only two subsidized pilot plants have been in operation.

"Recreation and tourism is an exceedingly large and rapidly
growing market, which exceeded $2 trillion in 1986 (Miller

the world’s gross product and represents an important
socioeconomic activity in the coastal environment (see
Chapter 9). The organizational and operational facilities for the
tourist industry—which include, for example, hotels, airports,
ports, marinas, and the like—affect ecosystems such as estuar-
ies, salt marshes, mangroves, seagrass beds, and other wetlands
and coral reefs, all of which are already at risk due to pollution
from human activities (Miller and Auyong, 1991). Maintaining
a balance between developing tourism and recreation and pre-

change because adverse human impacts on the coastal zone are
likely to be amplified by the coastal effects of climate change

"Studies of past climate changes show that sea surface tempera-

greater thermal inertia, changes in oceanic conditions will lag
behind changes on the continents [e.g., by 10 years for the North
Pacific (Wigley et al., 1985)]. The correlation between SST and
land temperatures from a coupled ocean-atmosphere model sug-
gests that SST will increase at a rate generally in line with the
increase of mean land-temperature values (Manabe et al., 1991).
Exceptions might occur in a belt around Antarctica and in the
high-latitude North Atlantic. The modeled SST around
Antarctica increases more slowly because of the upwelling deep-
water masses. The predicted temperature increase in the high-
Jatitude North Atlantic also is slower, apparently due to a weak-
ening of the conveyor belt thermohaline circulation. The weak-
ened conveyor belt could recover if atmospheric CO, concentra-
tion leveled off at double the present value but might never
recover if it quadrupled (Manabe and Stouffer, 1993), driving the
climate system into unknown directions. Exceptions also are
expected to occur in arctic and subarctic regions, where the pre-

"The El Nifio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) results from fluc-
tuations in the internal interactions within the Earth’s ocean-
atmosphere system and is the most significant source of
interannual variability in weather and climate around the

an atmospheric pattern that extends over most of the global
tropics. It principally involves a seesaw in atmospheric mass
between regions near Indonesia and the Pacific Ocean region
centered near Easter Island. The El Nifio component of ENSO
is an anomalous warming of the eastern and central tropical
Pacific Ocean. In major “warm events,” warming extends
over much of the tropical Pacific and becomes clearly linked
to the atmospheric SO pattern. ENSO events occur every 3 to
10 years, although in recent years the frequency has
increased. The influence of ENSO sometimes extends to
higher latitudes and has far-reaching climatic and economic
consequences around the world (Ropelewski and Halpert,

fall (Mikolajewicz et al., 1990). Regional differences
in sea-level change are to be expected (see also
Church et al., 1991; Cubasch et al., 1994). Therefore,
there also will be significant regional differences in
sea-level rise with global warming. In addition, it
should be emphasized that for coastal environments, it
is the relative sea level that matters [i.e., the level of
the sea in relation to that of the land (see Chapter 9)].

"Coastal ecosystems are especially vulnerable in this context.
They are being subjected to habitat degradation; excessive
nutrient loading, resulting in harmful algal blooms; fallout
from aerosol contaminants; and emergent diseases. Human
interventions also have led to losses of living marine resources
and reductions in biodiversity from biomass removals at
increasingly lower trophic levels (Sherman, 1994; Beddington,
1995; Pauly and Christiansen, 1995). The effects on biodiver-
sity are likely to be much less severe in the open ocean than in
estuaries and wetlands, where species in shallow, restricted
impoundments would be affected long before deep-oceanic
species (Bernal, 1991).

"In high latitudes, higher mean water temperature could lead to
an increase in the duration of the growing period and ultimate-
ly in increased bioproductivity in these regions. On the other
hand, the probability of nutrient loss resulting from reduced
deep-water exchange could result in reduced productivity in
the long term—again highlighting the importance of changes
in temperature on patterns of circulation. Global warming
could have especially strong impacts on the regions of oceanic
subpolar fronts (Roots, 1989), where the temperature increase
in deep water could lead to a substantial redistribution of
pelagic and benthic communities, including commercially
important fish species.

"The chief biotic effects on individuals of an increase in mean
water temperature would be increased growth and develop-

increased, one would expect a poleward shift of oceanic biota.
While this may be the general case, there could be important
regional variations due to shifts in atmospheric and oceanic cir-
culation. The resulting changes in predator-prey abundance
and poleward shifts in species’ ranges and migration patterns
could, in the case of marine fisheries, lead to increased survival
of economically valuable species and increased yield. Such
cases have been observed by Wooster and Fluharty (1985) as a

"For tropical latitudes, GCMs predict temperature increases that _
are half of those predicted for high latitudes, and the impacts in
tropical latitudes are less clear. A 1.5°C increase would raise the
summertime mean temperature to 30.5°C over much of the trop-
ical and subtropical regions. Most migratory organisms are
expected to be able to tolerate such a change, but the fate of
sedentary species will be highly dependent on local climate
changes. Some corals would be affected (as in the 1983 and
1987 bleaching events), but it is expected that other environ-
mental stresses (e.g., pollution, sedimentation, or nutrient influx)
may remain more important factors (e.g., Maul, 1993; Milliman,

doubling of CO, over the next 50 years, the global distribution of
storms should be siinilar to the present geographical position and
seasonal variability—although the number of storms is signifi-
cantly reduced, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere. Tropical
cyclone models require an initial disturbance to be present before
a full-scale cyclone develops. A GCM, with its coarser horizontal
resolution, cannot produce a better resolution than a cyclone
model. Correlations also have been found between ENSO (as
well as the southeast Asian monsoon) and the regional patterns of
tropical cyclone activity (Nicholls, 1984; Evans and Allan, 1992).
Unfortunately, it is not yet possible to say how ENSO, and thus
tropical cyclones in these regions, will be affected by global

The concentrations of people living in high-risk coastal regions

will be adverse consequences for living and nonliving resource
exploitation in the ocean and in coastal areas, for marine trans-

however, that scientific assessment of impacts in this context
can differ from economic evaluation of loss because the
methodologies used to assess loss are different. From a scien-
tific perspective, damage or injury would be assessed in terms
of the components and interrelationships in a particular ecosys-

by value as determined by some market. It is therefore quite
possible to get a scientific assessment of low injury to an

could affect the distribution and characteristics of polynyas

addition, changes in the extent and duration of ice, combined
with changes in characteristics of currents—for example, the

Similarly, a reduction in ice cover would reduce food supplies

and that this process could have been one of the factors respon-
sible for changes in atmospheric CO, contents observed in the
ice-core record. Their conclusions have been contested by
other researchers who suggest that CO.-limited photosynthesis
cannot be equated with CO,-limited growth rates (e.g., Turpin,
1993). Further research will be needed to ascertain whether
increased CO, concentrations are likely to have the effects sug-
gested by Riebesell et al. (1993).

"The major process by which marine biota sequester CO, is
thought to be controlled by nutrients, not by the concentration
of dissolved inorganic carbon. A weakening of vertical and
horizontal circulation as a result of warming (e.g., Manabe and
Stouffer, 1993) could result in fewer nutrients in surface water,
leading to a reduction of biological CO, uptake and storage
(Volk and Hoffert, 1985). At the same time, less carbon-
enriched deep water would be carried to the surface where the
CO, is released to the atmosphere. The two effects result from
the same process but affect the storage of carbon in opposite
directions; they dominate models that use constant carbon-to-
nutrient ratios to describe the marine biosphere (e.g., Bacastow
and Maier-Reimer, 1990). These models project that a reduc-
tion of ocean circulation and vertical mixing -will increase
oceanic carbon storage slightly. A reduction in vertical mixing
in the ocean also leads to a reduced downward transport of
excess CO). It reduces the capacity of the oceans to store
excess CO, because progressively less water is in contact with
the surface over the period of atmospheric perturbation.

"Climate change also can affect the role of marine biota in other
ways. Shifts may occur in the structure of biological communi-
ties in the upper ocean—for example, from coccolithophorids to
diatoms—as a result of increased freshwater influx from melt-
ing ice and river runoff. This change will alter the ratio of
organic carbon to carbonate carbon in the material settling out
of the surface layers of the sea (Berger and Keir, 1984; Ittekkot
et al., 1991), Biologically mediated carbon storage in the ocean
is determined by the rate of transfer of organic matter from the
surface layers, which exchange gases with the atmosphere, to
the deep ocean, which remains isolated from the atmosphere for
up to hundreds of years. The role of this transfer in the context
of deep-sea carbon storage has not been adequately addressed
in the scientific literature. Recent studies suggest that eolian
dust and river-derived mineral matter can enhance carbon fixa-
tion at the sea surface by providing essential trace constituents
such as iron (e.g., Martin and Fitzwater, 1987, Murray et al.,
1994), Furthermore, this material can accelerate the transfer of
organic matter to the deep sea by providing “ballast” material
for rapidly sinking organic aggregates (Figure 8-5; Ittekkot,
1993). Thus, the efficiency of carbon storage in the deep sea
may be affected by a changing climate and associated changes
in atmospheric and ocean circulation and nutrient availability,
combined with other global changes such as desertification. The
magnitude and the direction of these changes remain unclear.
Major national and international activities within the frame-
work of JGOFS (Joint Global Ocean Flux Study) and GLOBEC
(Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics) are expected to provide
data to assess the role of biological processes in the removal of
CO, from the atmosphere into the depths of the oceans.

rates—thus accelerating the transfer of newly fixed carbon dioxide to the deep sea. Strong winds enhance the effect as well. The efficiency of
this transfer—therefore of carbon storage in the deep sea—is expected to be affected by global warming (after Ittekkot, 1993).

dimethyl sulfide (DMS) by specific phytoplankton species in

other feedbacks in the climate system, although the direction
and quantitative significance of such feedbacks have to be
assessed. The role of the oceans in the contribution of other
greenhouse gases to the atmosphere—such as, for example,
methane and nitrous oxide—is just beginning to be assessed,

"pollutants into the oceans will be affected: river runoff and
atmospheric transport. The impacts of global warming on
coastal and ocean pollution can be expected to depend on the
way global warming will affect the nature and concentrations
of pollutants in question, as well as on changes in their per-
sistence in the environment. Changes in the cycling and dis-
tribution between phases (dissolved versus sedimentary)
could occur under a global warming scenario for sewage,
organics, organochlorines, and heavy metals (e.g., Tsyban et
al., 1990). In most cases, phase transitions can be expected.
A rise in temperature also may result in accelerated biodegra-
dation of global organic pollutants (petroleum and chlorinat-
ed hydrocarbons, etc.). This process would promote their
removal from the biologically active surface layers of the
ocean (Izrael and Tsyban, 1989; Tanabe, 1985). However, the
fate of degradation products is less well-known, and there
also is the possibility of an increase in the toxicity of at least
some of the pollutants under such conditions and with higher
temperature. Further, the impact of climate change can be
expected to be more severe in coastal seas and landlocked
marine basins—such as, for example, the Baltic Sea and the
Black Sea, which are already seriously impacted by pollution
from human activities.

developed largely in isolation from each other and because dif-

have matured into almost fully autonomous sectors, with only
weak or no links among them. These sectors are still needed for

based on an understanding of the fate and transport of contam-

Significant issues include the persistence of contaminants in the
aquatic environments, their uptake by commercially important

waste streams in order to curtail long-term damage. In this con-

of pollution, especially agricultural and urban runoff, and to
avoid placing the greatest burdens on estuaries and the coastal

development of long-term monitoring capabilities and standard-

required for OTEC plants is 20°C (Charlier and Justus, 1993), the
crucial question is to what extent the intermediate water will warm
relative to the surface. Should the temperature differential become
unfavorable, two corrective measures are at least theoretically pos-
sible for floating power plants: relocate the plant, or increase the
depth of the cold-water pipe. However, both of these options are
seriously constrained by cost, and increasing the depth of the pipe
imposes maintenance requirements that are severe below about
450 m (Charlier and Justus, 1993). For marine transportation, if

carbon exploitation will be facilitated by the reduction in ice
cover in polar seas, the development of these regions for trans-

critical issues are relative scarcity, substitutability of materi-
als/products, extension of available resources as a result of
technological innovation, or location and exploitation of previ-
ously uneconomic resources (Broadus, 1987). Increasing
reliance on more costly resources tends to raise the price of

climate change are beneficial, some are neutral, and some are

combination thereof. Such transfers will have price effects,
which could affect the competitiveness of ocean industries in
relation to each other and their competitors on land. In some
cases (e.g., the impacts of sea-level rise), the total burden of
cost transfers is likely to be greatest on those least able to bear

"Since 1990, there has been a large increase in research effort
directed at understanding the biogeophysical effects of climate
change and particularly sea-level rise on coastal zones and
small islands. Studies have confirmed that low-lying deltaic
and barrier coasts and low-elevation reef islands and coral
atolls are especially sensitive to a rising sea level, as well as
changes in rainfall, storm frequency, and intensity. Impacts
could include inundation, flooding, erosion, and saline intru-
sion. However, it has also been shown that such responses will
be highly variable among and within these areas; impacts are
likely to be greatest where local environments are already
under stress as a result of human activities.

"The coast is not a passive system but will respond
dynamically to sea-level and climate changes (High
Confidence).

Arange of coastal responses can be expected, depend-
ing on local circumstances and climatic conditions
(High Confidence).

In the past, estuaries and coastal wetlands could often
cope with sea-level rise, although usually by migra-
tion landward. Human infrastructure, however, has
diminished this possibility in many places (High
Confidence).

Survival of salt marshes and mangroves appears like-
ly where the rate of sedimentation will approximate
the rate of local sea-level rise (High Confidence).
Generally, coral reefs have the capacity to keep pace
with projected sea-level rise but may suffer from increas-
es in seawater temperature (Medium Confidence).

"Since the IPCC First Assessment Report (1990) and its
supplement (1992), the interrelationships between the impacts
of climate change and human activities have become bet-
ter understood. Although the potential impacts of climate
change by itself may not always be the largest threat to
natural coastal systems, in conjunction with other stresses
they can become a serious issue for coastal societies, par-
ticularly in those places where the resilience of natural
coastal systems has been reduced. Taking into account the
potential impacts of climate change and associated sea-level
rise can assist in making future development more sustain-
able. A proactive approach to enhance resilience and reduce
vulnerability would be beneficial to coastal zones and small
islands both from an environmental and from an economic
perspective. It is also in line with the recommendations of
the UN Conference on Environment and Development
(UNCED) Agenda 21. Failure to act expeditiously could
increase future costs, reduce future options, and lead to irre-
versible changes.

In addition, more research is required on the process of inte-
grated coastal zone management to improve the understanding
and modeling capability of the implications of climate change

implementing these options while taking into account contem-
porary conditions as well as future problems such as climate
change and sea-level rise, will be a great challenge in both
developing and industrialized countries. It is envisaged that the
most suitable range of options will vary among and within
countries. An appropriate mechanism for coastal planning
under these varying conditions is integrated coastal zone man-
agement. There is no single recipe for integrated coastal zone
management; rather, it constitutes a portfolio of sociocultural
dimensions and structural, legal, financial, economic, and insti-
tutional measures.

"Sea-level rise would have negative impacts on a num-
ber of sectors, including tourism, freshwater supply
and quality, fisheries and aquaculture, agriculture,
human settlements, financial services, and human
health (High Confidence).

Based on first-order estimates of population distribu-
tion, storm-surge probabilities, and existing levels of
protection, more than 40 million people are estimated
to experience flooding due to storm surge in an aver-
age year under present climate and sea-level condi-
tions. Most of these people reside in the developing
world. Ignoring possible adaptation and likely popu-
lation growth, these numbers could roughly double or
triple due to sea-level rise in the next century
(Medium Confidence).

Protection of many low-lying island states (e.g., the
Marshall Islands, the Maldives) and nations with large
deltaic areas (e.g., Bangladesh, Nigeria, Egypt,
China) is likely to be very costly (High Confidence).
Adaptation to sea-level rise and climate change will
involve important tradeoffs, which could include
environmental, economic, social, and cultural values

"Many attempts have been made to define the “coastal zone”
and its land and seaward boundaries. Some definitions are
based on physiographic characteristics, such as the extent of
tidal influence on the land or the geomorphology of the conti-
nental shelf; others simply use a fixed distance from the shore-
line. In the case of small islands, the coastal zone could
include the entire island. While the boundaries of the coastal
zone may or may not coincide with political or administrative
boundaries, they rarely coincide with those of areas from
which demands on the resources of the coastal area are
derived (Ehler, 1993).

"Coastal zones and small islands contain some of the world’s
most diverse and productive resources. They include extensive
areas of complex and specialized ecosystems, such as man-
groves, coral reefs, and seagrasses, which are highly sensitive
to human intervention. These ecosystems are the source of a
significant proportion of global food production. Moreover,
they support a variety of economic activities, including fish-
eries and aquaculture, tourism, recreation, and transportation.
In recent decades, many coastal areas have been heavily mod-
ified and intensively developed, which has significantly
increased their vulnerability to natural coastal dynamics and
the anticipated impacts of global climate change.
"	Text
"The global importance of coastal zones and small islands in
terms of both ecological and socioeconomic values is widely
recognized. Many international organizations; including IPCC,
have called for action to implement strategies toward better
planning and management of coastal areas and resources to
prevent them from being degraded and becoming progressive-
ly more vulnerable to the potential impacts of climate change
and associated sea-level rise. The World Coast Conference,
partly held under the auspices of IPCC, has supported the
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNCED, 1992a)
and Agenda 21, Chapter 17 (UNCED, 1992b), requiring action
on coastal zone management planning, among many other ini-
tiatives, by all signatories (WCC’93, 1993).

"The structure of this chapter is schematically depicted in
Figure 9-1. This figure also shows how this chapter relates to
other chapters and Working Group reports of this IPCC
Second Assessment Report. In Section 9.2, the functions and
values of coastal zones and small islands are discussed.
Special emphasis is put on the importance of maintaining the
proper functioning of coastal systems with regard to sustain-
able development and their resilience to climate change.
Section 9.3 then discusses the likely consequences of climate
change on sea-level rise, sea-surface temperatures, and tropi-
cal cyclones in the context of coastal zones and small islands.
On this basis, Section 9.4 addresses the effects of climate
change on biogeophysical systems, and Section 9.5 examines
the socioeconomic impacts. Section 9.6 considers response
strategies to climate change and the need to integrate them
with other coastal management activities. Finally, Section 9.7
identifies needs and opportunities for future research and
monitoring that would help nations to respond more appropri-
ately to the likely impacts of climate change on coastal zones
and small islands.

"In large measure, human social and economic well-being
depends directly or indirectly on the availability of environ-
mental goods and services provided by marine and coastal sys-
tems. Coastal zones and small islands are characterized by
highly diverse ecosystems, and a great number of functions are
performed over a relatively small area. This concentration of
functions, together with their spatial location, makes coastal
zones and small islands highly attractive areas for people to
live and work in. Coastal human populations in many countries
have been growing at double the national rate due to migration
to urban coastal centers; it is estimated that 50-70% of the
global human population lives in the coastal zone, although
there are great variations among countries. The existing rate of
socioeconomic development in coastal zones also is unprece-

"quality. They include regulation of erosion and sedimentation
patterns, regulation of the chemical composition of the
atmosphere and oceans, flood prevention, waste assimilation,
maintenance of migration and nursery habitats, and mainte-
nance of biological diversity. Many natural and seminatural
coastal systems thus play a fundamental part in the regulation
of essential biospheric processes that contribute to the mainte-
nance of a healthy environment and the long-term stability of
the biosphere, including the climate system. User and produc-
tion functions are essential in providing many living and non-
living resources that are utilized by human society. These func-
tions include the provision of space and a suitable substrate for
human habitation and a variety of socioeconomic activities.
Important socioeconomic activities in coastal zones and small
islands include tourism and recreation, exploitation of living
and nonliving resources (e.g., fisheries and aquaculture; agri-
culture; extraction of water, oil, and gas), industry and com-
merce, infrastructure development (e.g., harbors, ports,
bridges, roads, sea-defense works), and nature conservation.
Information functions relate to the part that nature plays in
meeting human intellectual and emotional needs. For example,
coastal systems can be a source for cultural inspiration, but
they also serve as a storehouse for genetic information. Also,
scientific understanding of coastal processes and evolution
depends on the geological and biological information that
coastal systems contain.

"Nonetheless, increasingly large areas of coasts and small
islands have been managed with the aim of maximizing the
financial “resource take” provided by the user and production
functions performed by coastal systems. However, when one
particular function is overexploited, this may not only result in
the depletion of the resources that this function provides; it can
also reduce the performance of other functions below their full
potential. For example, when mangroves are logged and
cleared in an unsustainable way, it can be at the expense of

"Nonetheless, some studies are available that have produced esti-
mates of the monetary value of coastal functions, using a vari-
ety of techniques. For example, recreation and amenity benefits
provided by the Broadlands coastal wetland in England are esti-
mated to be around $5 million per year (Bateman et al., 1995).
The storm buffering function of the Terrebonne coastal wet-
lands in Louisiana (United States) has been valued in terms of
storm damage avoided. If the wetlands continue to recede at
their present rate (3-4 m/yr), the present discounted value of
increased expected property damage lies between $2.1-3.1 mil-
lion (Constanza et al., 1989). The total monetary value of all
functions performed in the Ecuadorian Galépagos National
Park amounts to $138 million per year (De Groot, 1992a).

"studies confirm that coastal systems possess significant eco-
nomic value, in terms of both use and non-use outputs.
Mangrove forests, for example, have been shown to sustain
more than 70 direct human activities, ranging from fuelwood
collection to artisinal fisheries (Dixon, 1989). However, some
uses preclude others, so some caution is necessary when the
total economic value of such a system is estimated. This cau-
tion is also justified by the fact that many functions provide
nonmarket goods and services and therefore do not carry
appropriate market prices and value. Moreover, individuals
and communities may find that nature has a value of its own,
independent of human use or perception. They would there-
fore value nature purely because it exists and would feel a
loss if it was damaged or destroyed.

"In most coastal nations, a considerable part of gross national
product (GNP) is derived from activities that are directly or
indirectly connected with coastal zones. Therefore, maintain-
ing the proper functioning of marine and coastal systems is of
significant concern to a country’s economy. In the shorter
term, however, large financial benefits may be available at
the expense of longer-term sustainability. Many coastal prob-
lems that are currently being encountered worldwide can be
attributed to the unsustainable use and unrestricted develop-
ment of coastal areas and resources. These problems include
the accumulation of contaminants in coastal areas, erosion,
and the rapid decline of habitats and natural resources. Great
care must therefore be taken in planning to avoid overdevel-
opment and degrading or destroying the very environment
that attracted coastal development in the first place.

"Sea-level rise and possible changes in the frequency and/or
intensity of extreme events, such as temperature and precipi-
tation extremes, cyclones, and storm surges, constitute the
components of climate change that are of most concern to
coastal zones and small islands. Short-term extreme events are
superimposed on long-term changes in CO, concentrations,
climate, and sea level, and all aspects work in concert to bring
about environmental change at regional and local levels. In
order to understand fully their interactive effects on the coast,
it is paramount to know how the means, variability, and
extremes of the range of relevant climatic elements will
change at local and regional scales. At such scales—with pos-
sibly a few exceptions—the predictive capability of models is
currently very low, and knowledge about possible future
changes in variability and extremes is meager. This section
summarizes the main findings regarding sea-level and climate
change that pertain to coastal zones (see the IPCC Working
Group I volume for a full discussion).
"	Text
"One can state that sustainable development in coastal zones
and small islands is realized only when it enables the coastal
system to self-organize—that is, to perform all its potential
functions without adversely affecting other natural or human
systems. Climate change could pose an additional threat to the
full performance of these functions, compounding the pres-
sures that present-day development activities already place on
coastal zone capacities. Overexploitation of resources, pollu-
tion, sediment starvation, and urbanization may inhibit or
destroy the working of functions that are essential to the provi-
sion of goods and services that are difficult to value in mone-
tary terms, or in maintaining the resilience of coastal ecosys-
tems to external stresses, such as climate change. For instance,
one important regulation function of natural systems in coastal
zones and small islands is the provision of a buffering capaci-
ty, protecting the land against the dynamics of the sea. As cli-
mate changes and sea level rises, this function will become
even more important than it is today, preventing coastal areas
from being eroded and inundated as much as they would with-
out this natural protection. Nevertheless, although present-day
human activities often result in large financial payoffs in the
short term, they may also lead to environmental degradation.
Such degradation results in the loss of functions, may increase
coastal vulnerability to climate change, and has adverse eco-
nomic effects on tourism, fishing, and other aspects of the
coastal economy. In some cases, the long-term costs of these
environmental disruptions may be greater than the long-term
benefits of the human activity that caused them.

"In 1990, IPCC provided a best estimate and a range of uncer-
tainty of sea-level rise, based on a “business-as-usual” projec-
tion of greenhouse-gas emissions for the period 1990-2100. It
was estimated that sea level would, on average, rise by about
6 mm/yr, within a range of uncertainty of 3-10 mm/yr (Warrick
and Oerlemans, 1990). Subsequent to IPCC90, projections of
sea-level rise have been lower, largely as a result of downward
revisions in the rate of global warming, which drives sea-level
rise (see Section 9.3.2).
"	Text
"Present estimates of sea-level rise have been presented in
Chapter 7, Changes in Sea Level, of the IPCC Working Group
I volume. For a forcing scenario (1S92a) comparable to that
of the IPCC 1990 assessment, it is estimated that sea level
would, on average, rise by about 5 mm/yr, within a range of
uncertainty of 2-9 mm/yr (see Figure 9-3). An important
point to bear in mind is that the current best estimates repre-
sent a rate of sea-level rise that is about two to five times the
rate experienced over the last 100 years (i.e., 1.0-2.5 mm/yr).
The current projections of sea-level rise should therefore be
of major concern in the context of coastal zones and small
islands. Furthermore, model projections show that sea level
will continue to rise beyond the year 2100 due to lags in cli-
mate response, even with assumed stabilization of global
greenhouse-gas emissions (Wigley, 1995).
"	Text
"One cannot assume that changes in sea level at regional
and local levels will necessarily be the same as the global-
average change, for two broad reasons. First, vertical land
movements affect sea level. With respect to the coastal
environment, it is relative sea level that is most impor-
tant—that is, the level of the sea in relation to that of the
land. Regionally and locally, vertical land movements can
be quite large, even on the decadal time scale. For example,
parts of Scandinavia experience uplift (and thus a relative
sea-level decline) of about 1 m per century due to the con-
tinuing “glacial rebound” following the contraction of the
large continental ice sheets at the end of the last Ice Age
some 10,000 years ago (Aubrey and Emery, 1993). In con-
trast, the Mississippi delta is experiencing subsidence (a
relative sea-level rise) of about 1 m per century due to con-
solidation by sediment loading and the diminished supply
of additional sediments to the delta required for accretion
(Day et al., 1993; Boesch et al., 1994), Locally, tectonic
activity, groundwater pumping, and petroleum extraction
can cause large and sometimes abrupt changes in relative
sea level (Milliman et al., 1989; Han et al., 1995b).
Subsidence of urban areas due to groundwater withdrawal
has been a significant problem in many locations. In Japan,
for example, 2.1 million people live in protected areas
below high water due to this cause. Box 9-1 includes four
examples of observed sea-level change. Emery and Aubrey

"One of the certainties regarding global climate change is that
the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (the major
player among the greenhouse gases), now about 360 ppmv, has
increased by about 29% over the preindustrial concentration
and will continue to increase in the future, even if rather strin-
gent policies on CO, emissions were adopted. Although con-
troversial, there is some evidence that increased CO, would
lead to significant increases in net primary productivity
through enhanced photosynthesis (Melillo et al., 1993), which

IPCC90 (about 0.2°C per decade, as compared to 0.3°C per

estimate projection still falls within a very large range of uncer-
tainty. Thus, such projections are plausible scenarios of what

"Second, there are dynamic effects resulting from oceanic cir-
culation, wind and pressure patterns, and ocean-water densi-
ty that cause variations in the level of the sea surface with
respect to the geoid—that is, the surface that the ocean would
describe in the absence of currents, winds, and so forth. These
variations have been observed to be on the order of 1 m for
major current systems such as the Gulf Stream, Kuroshio, and
the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (Pugh, 1987; Levitus,
1982). Climate change may affect ocean circulation, which
can result in regional changes of this sea-surface “topogra-
phy.” Recent advances in ocean-atmosphere modeling offer
some idea of the possible magnitude of such changes (e.g.,
Mikolajewicz et al., 1990; Gregory, 1993; Murphy, 1992;
Church et al., 1991; Cubasch ef al., 1992). Model results
show ranges of regional sea-level change that are on the order
of two to three times the global-average change (see Box 8-2
in Chapter 8). However, it should be emphasized that confi-
dence in coupled ocean-atmosphere model predictions of
regional sea-level changes still must be considered low, as
reliable regional scenarios of this effect are not yet available
for impact analysis.

"Figure 9-4 shows tide-gauge measurements of sea-level
changes in Stockholm (Sweden), Fort Phrachula (Bangkok,
Thailand), Honolulu (Hawaii, United States), and
Nezugaseki (Japan). In a period of rising global sea levels,
these four places show different trends in sea-level change
due to their being situated in different geological settings.
This illustrates the importance of local conditions on rela-
tive sea level. In Stockholm, glacial rebound is causing the
land to rise out of the sea, resulting in a sea-level fall rela-
tive to the land of ~4 mm/yr. In Bangkok, human influence
is apparent: Although over the period 1940-1994 relative
sea-level rise averages 13.19 + 0.73 mm/yr, two separate
trends can be distinguished; the first, until about 1960,
averages ~3 mm/yr, and the second, from 1960 onward, is
~20 mm/yr. The latter trend reflects the increased effort in
groundwater pumping since 1960 (Emery and Aubrey,
1991). Nezugaseki shows the dramatic effects of an earth-
quake, which caused a 15-cm land submergence in 1964,
along a coast generally dominated by emergence (Emery
and Aubrey, 1991). The Honolulu record is believed to
reflect a stable site and it is the only one of the four exam-
ples that approximates the global trend.

"Although changes in sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) are pro-
jected to be less than those on land, they are not necessarily
less significant. As Edwards (1995) has pointed out, a 2°C
change in SST in the tropical and subtropical oceans is consid-
ered to be anomalous, but is on the order of temperature
changes associated with strong El Nifio/Southern Oscillation
(ENSO) events, In comparison, the projected change in mean
sea-surface temperature for these regions is on the order of
1-2°C by the year 2100. Thus, by 2100, SSTs that are now con-

"Despite the often repeated assertion that climate variability
could increase in a warmer world, there is little evidence from
climate models to support this notion (Gates et al., 1992).
However, Working Group I has identified at least one excep-
tion that has potentially large implications for coastal areas:
Various GCMs consistently predict a higher frequency of
convective precipitation in mid- to high-latitude regions of
the world. This anticipated change may imply more intense
local rainfall, with a decrease in the return period of extreme
rainfall events (e.g., Gordon et al., 1992). This could interact
with sea-level rise to further increase the likelihood of flood-
ing in low-lying coastal areas (Titus et al., 1987; Nicholls et
al., 1995).

"The mean surface air temperature increases more over
land than over oceans (by about a factor of two), and
at higher latitudes during winter. The climate of the
coastal zone tends to be moderated by ocean temper-
ature and will thus be strongly influenced by sea-sur-
face temperature changes. Northern Hemisphere
warming is greater than Southern Hemisphere warm-
ing because of the larger extent of land.

In general, global models show increases in precipita-
tion throughout the year in the high latitudes and dur-
ing the winter in mid-latitudes. Most models show
some increase in Asian monsoon rainfall.

At scales relevant to coastal zones and small islands,
predictions of changes in other climate elements, such
as windiness, storminess or radiation, cannot yet be
considered reliable.
"	List
"Without any change in variability, however, a change in mean
value still implies a change in the frequency of extreme events.
Because such events by definition are at the tails of the proba-
bility distribution, the change in return periods can be quite
large relative to the change in mean value. In the absence of
information about changes in variability, this simple concept
has been employed to create scenarios of changes in
extremes—for example, for temperature in Britain (Warrick
and Barrow, 1991), rainfall in Australia (Pittock et al., 1991),
and storm surges in the United States (Stakhiv et al., 1991). As
has been pointed out at the beginning of this section, in most
cases it is the combination of climate extremes—temperature,
precipitation, winds, sea levels—and how they are affected by
longer-term changes in climatic means that are especially
important for considering the future effects of global warming
on coastal zones and small islands. Yet little understanding of
the possible interaction of different aspects of climate change
in the coastal zone exists.

"Tropical cyclones (also known as hurricanes or typhoons,
depending on region) affect vast coastal areas in tropical and sub-
tropical countries. Tropical cyclones and associated storm surges
can cause enormous loss of life and have devastating impacts on
coastal ecosystems and morphology. It is therefore of critical
importance to know how the frequency, magnitude, and areal
‘occurrence of such storms will change in a warmer world, if at
all. Unfortunately, the evidence from theoretical and numerical
models and from observational data is, as yet, inconclusive.
While current GCMs provide some indication of possible tropi-
cal cyclone formation, identifying “tropical disturbances” (e.g.,
see Broccoli and Manabe, 1990; Haarsma et al., 1993), they can-
not explicitly model such storms at the present grid-scale resolu-
tion (Mitchell et al., 1990), However, recent work has been mov-
ing in this direction (e.g., Bengtsson et al., 1994). Alternatively,
theoretical storm models have been used to examine the maxi-
mum storm intensity in relation to SSTs (Emanuel, 1987) but can-
not easily be extended to address questions of regional changes in
tropical storm intensity or frequency under conditions of climate
change (Schlesinger, 1993; Lighthill et al., 1994),

"At present, there is no evidence of any systematic shift in storm
tracks. The tracks are governed by the location of cyclogenesis
and prevailing meteorological conditions; thus far, there is no
evidence of shift in the preferred locations of cyclogenesis.
Empirical studies have found correlations between ENSO and
the regional patterns of tropical cyclone activity (as well as the
Southeast Asian monsoon, Atlantic hurricanes, Pacific precipi-
tation patterns, and other phenomena) (Nicholls, 1984; Evans
and Allan, 1992; see also Chapter 3, Observed Climate
Variability and Change, of the IPCC Working Group I vol-
ume). Progress is being made on model simulations of the pre-
sent features of ENSO-like events (e.g., Philander et al., 1992),
which could lead to a predictive capability for the future.
Recent coupled-model simulations under enhanced CO, show
a tendency toward ENSO-like patterns in the Pacific, with
accompanying temperature and precipitation variability (see
Chapter 6, Climate Models—Projections of Future Climate, of
the IPCC Working Group I volume), but realistic simulations
of ENSO are not yet possible. The behavior of ENSO is criti-
cal in understanding the future coastal effects of both climate
change and sea-level rise in the Pacific region and elsewhere
(Pittock and Flather, 1993; Pittock, 1993). In short, it is not yet
possible to say whether either the intensity or frequency of
tropical cyclones (or ENSO) would increase or the areas of
occurrence would shift in a warmer world.

world and that certain coastal environments would be especial-
ly at risk. These included tidal deltas and low-lying coastal
plains, sandy beaches and barrier islands, coastal wetlands,
estuaries and lagoons, mangroves, and coral reefs. Small
islands became a major focus of concern because some of the

"Many of the early studies on the effects of climate change
emphasized sea-level rise and were based on a simple inun-
dation model that vertically shifted the land-sea boundary
landward by the amount of the projected global rise.
However, it has become increasingly clear from recent stud-
ies that the geomorphological and ecological responses to a
rising sea level will be complex and will also reflect a large
number of other factors, including other aspects of climate
change. No longer can effects be defined simply in terms of
inundation of the sea upon the land, nor by just shifting the
land-sea contour by an amount corresponding to the project-
ed vertical increase in global sea level. Biogeophysical
effects will vary greatly in different coastal zones around the
world because coastal landforms and ecosystems are dynam-
ic and both respond to and modify the variety of external and
internal processes that affect them. Effects will depend not
only on the local pattern of sea-level rise and climate change
(as shown in Section 9.3) but also on the nature of the local
coastal environment and on the human, ecological, and phys-
ical responsiveness of the particular coastal system being
considered (J.R. French et al., 1995).

"In spite of the increased research effort, there is still no gener-
ally accepted global typology of coastal types relating to the
potential effects of sea-level rise and climate change. There
have been some attempts based on the resistance of the coast to
environmental forces (e.g., Van der Weide, 1993), some based
on both natural and socioeconomic features and processes
(Pernetta and Milliman, 1995), and some through the develop-
ment of a coastal vulnerability index that captures the different
characteristics of a coastal region (e.g., Gornitz, 1991). The
development of such a typology is clearly an area for substan-
tial international research in the future. Moreover, the empha-
sis of recent studies on coastal types has been quite uneven. For
instance, there has been little research on the potential effects of
sea-level rise and climate change on high-latitude coasts, bold
coasts, rocky shores, coastal cliffs, coarse clastic coasts, gravel
barriers, coastal sand dunes, and seagrass beds. This lack of
emphasis, however, does not necessarily imply that anticipated
effects on these coastal types are less serious. Studies that show
a strong correlation between sea-level rise and erosion of, for
‘example, coastal cliffs, gravel barriers, and sand dunes include
Griggs and Trenhaile (1994), Carter and Orford (1993), and Van

"Deltas form where terrigenous sediment brought down to the
coast by rivers accumulates more rapidly than can be removed
by waves, tides, and currents. Although there is a wide spec-

ancient times, deltas have been of fundamental importance to
civilizations due-to the presence of highly productive agricul-
tural lands, fisheries, and human settlement. Many modern
delta regions, with their dense populations and intensive eco-
nomic activities, are now in crisis because of past management
practices such as dam, dyke, and canal construction and habi-
tat destruction, which have led to problems such as enhanced
subsidence and reduced accretion, salinity intrusion, water
quality deterioration, and decreased biological production

"Open coasts, primarily made up of unconsolidated sands and
gravels and exposed to wind and wave action, are common on
all inhabited continents and islands of all sizes. About 20% of
the world’s coast is sandy and backed by beach ridges, dunes,
or other sandy deposits. International studies reported by Bird
(1985, 1993b) indicate that over the last 100 years about 70%
of the world’s sandy shorelines have been retreating; about
20-30% have been stable and less than 10% advancing. He has
listed at least twenty possible reasons for the prevalence of ero-
sion and has indicated that sea-level rise is only one possibili-
ty. Although Stive et al. (1990), Leatherman (1991), and others
have recognized a causal relationship between erosion and sea-
level rise, many attempts to correlate accelerated coastal ero-
sion with global sea-level rise over the last 100 years have not
been convincing because of the difficulties in excluding other
factors, including human impacts. Analyses of erosional trends
on sandy shorelines over the past several decades indicate a
predominance of local rather than common explanations—sug-
gesting that, if sea-level rise has been a contributor, its contri-
bution may have been masked by other mechanisms.

"Second, morphostratigraphic studies, particularly of sandy bar-
riers, have been undertaken, although frequently these studies
predate the recent interest in attempting to predict future
coastal response to climate change and sea-level rise.
Nevertheless, sandy-barrier responses to rises in sea level in
the Holocene can be used as historical analogues. Although
transgressive sedimentary sequences, where coastal barriers
migrate landward as a result of shoreface erosion and
washover, are widespread in North America, Europe, and
Australia, other responses to sea-level rise include in situ
growth (the stationary barrier) and even seaward advance (the
regressive sequence). As with other approaches, field-based
evolutionary morphostratigraphic models do not yield a con-
sistent response to sea-level rise. Rate of sediment supply and
coastal configuration are just two of the other factors that
influence how sandy shorelines will respond. In addition to
field-based studies, some indication of the complex way that
sand barriers have responded to post-glacial sea-level rise has
been shown through computer-simulation techniques (Cowell
and-Thom, 1994; Roy et al., 1994).

"Two other approaches have been used to gauge the effect of
sea-level rise on sedimentary coasts. First, models have been
used to predict beach-profile changes that will result from a
rise in water level. Model studies have been reviewed by inter-
national expert committees such as the Scientific Committee
on Oceanic Research (SCOR, 1991), as well as by individuals
(e.g., Healy, 1991; Leatherman, 1991). The best-known model
is that of Bruun (1962), who formulated a two-dimensional
relationship between rising sea level and the rate of shoreline
recession based on the concept of profile equilibrium, which
has been the subject of much evaluation (e.g., Dubois, 1992).
SCOR (1991) has noted that testing and application of the
models for beach response to a long-term rise in sea level have
been hampered by significant lag times of beach changes—
amounting to months or years—and the importance of other
elements of the sediment budget that produce shoreline erosion
or accretion irrespective of any sea-level rise. Profile changes
assumed by the models have been reasonably well-verified by
laboratory and field studies, but the predictive equations are
found to yield poor results when the effects of profile lag times
and complete sediment budgets are not included in the analy-
sis. One solution to these uncertainties is to determine a range
of beach-recession scenarios rather than a single estimate—

deltas are subsiding under the weight of accumulating sedi-

that a rising sea level will have two major effects on low-lying
deltaic areas: First, it is likely to cause extensive submergence,
especially where there is little prospect of compensating sedi-

More serious is the accelerated effect of saline water intruding
into groundwater aquifers in deltaic regions and coastal plains.
In these areas, the effect of sea-level rise can be exacerbated by
the withdrawal of freshwater, which may result in either subsi-
dence and/or replacement by seawater. Subsidence and land-

tidal range, prism and currents, and sedimentation would also

tend to widen and deepen. This may enhance their role as sed-
iment sinks, causing greater erosion of the neighboring open
coast (Stive et al., 1990). However, Pethick (1993) has shown
that along the southeast coast of Britain, where relative sea-
level rise is already 4—5 mm/yr due to local subsidence, estu-
arine channels are becoming wider and shallower by local
redistribution of sediment as the intertidal profile shifts both
upward and shoreward. In some areas, these effects may be off-

reduced sediment discharge, subsidence, and rising sea level,
there have been few attempts to determine the relative vulner-

study of the Chinese coast, in which six variables (relief, land

and coastal defenses) have been used to evaluate risk classes of
eight vulnerable areas. Exceptions to the latter include the con-

destructive short-term events such as hurricanes, damaging
human activities, and declining environmental quality. In spite
of a more optimistic outlook in recent years, Wilkinson and

and continued growth, which would result in shoreline erosion,
redistribution of sediment, and shoreline accretion, respective-
ly. Each of these processes can be observed on many reef
islands today, as well as in the stratigraphic record, suggesting
that the factors identified above are significant determinants of
island stability. Moreover, as Spencer (1995) has pointed out,
coral-island responses to future sea-level rise will vary as a
result of constraints on the development of modern reefs and
the varying inherited topographies upon which future sea-level

by adaptations to unconsolidated, periodically inundated saline
coastal habitats. They fringe about 25% of shorelines in the

effects of sea-level rise on tropical mangrove ecosystems have
been primarily of historical nature (reviewed by Woodroffe,

These studies have shown that extensive mangrove ecosystems
became reestablished when sea level stabilized around 6,000

as narrow coastal fringes, shifting landward with the migrating

and often is the primary source of potable water on atolls.
Recent studies suggest that the first approximation of the
response of the freshwater lens to sea-level rise (the Ghyben-
Herzberg principle) is not appropriate on small coral islands.
The layered-aquifer model—which, among other things, con-
siders geological structure and distinguishes between
Pleistocene and Holocene stratigraphic units—is considered
more appropriate for assessing freshwater inventories on such
islands. If recharge and island width remain constant or expand,
freshwater lenses may actually increase in size with a rise in sea
level because of the larger volume of freshwater that can.be
stored in the less-permeable upper (Holocene) aquifer
(Buddemeier and Oberdorfer, 1990). On the other hand, if
recharge or island width are reduced, a diminution in both fresh-
water quantity and quality can be expected. In many places,
increasing demand and recharge contamination are likely to be
more serious issues than freshwater inventory per se.

"Historical studies of temperate salt marshes include those of
Allen (1991) and Reed (1990), whereas Pethick (1993) and
French (1993) have used current trends and numerical simula-
tion, respectively. Pethick (1993) has shown that salt marshes
in southeast England appear to be migrating inland along the
estuary but that the natural changes are interrupted by the pres-
ence of flood embankments. The result is that loss of the sea-
ward boundaries of these wetlands will continue without com-
pensating landward migration—a process known as coastal
squeeze in the United Kingdom. Wolff et al. (1993) have con-
cluded that salt marshes have the ability to respond quickly to
sea-level rise as long as sedimentation and internal biomass
production processes keep pace and as long as the entire marsh
can move to higher shore levels or further inland. Provided that
it is not constrained by infrastructure, protection works, or
other barriers, vertical accretion is likely to neutralize sea-level
rise as long as sediment supply is sufficient and horizontal ero-
sion is absent or can be compensated. If not, salt marshes will
progressively decline and ultimately disappear. Pethick (1992)
has also shown that salt marshes under stable sea level under-
go cyclical changes to their seaward boundaries; infrequent
high-magnitude storm events erode the edges, while interven-
ing lower-magnitude events allow depositional recovery. An
increase in the frequency of storm events as a response to sea-
level rise would result in the replacement of such cyclical
change by progressive erosion. The sensitivity of certain salt-
marsh species to waterlogging and soil-chemical changes also
could result in a change in species composition or the migra-
tion of vegetation zones (Reed, 1995).

resilient to rates of sea-level rise about twice those suggested
as upper limits by Ellison and Stoddart (1991) from their study

more likely to survive in macrotidal, sediment-rich environ-

redistribute sediment (Semeniuk, 1994; Woodroffe, 1995),
than in microtidal sediment-starved environments such as

tend to become compressed and suffer reductions in species
diversity. On the other hand, extensive mangroves in deltaic
settings with continuing large inputs of terrigenous sediment

Thus, different responses can be envisaged in different man-
grove settings. Additionally, certain species are likely to be
more robust in the face of sea-level rise than others (Ellison
and Stoddart, 1991; Aksornkaoe and Paphavasit, 1993).

"Coral reefs are estimated to cover about 600,000 km? of the
Earth’s surface (Smith, 1978). They are dominated by calcify-
ing organisms that are depositing about 0.6 to 0.9 Gt of calci-
um carbonate (CaCO ) globally each year (Kinsey and Hopley,
1991), Intuitively, one would think that coral reefs—by precip-
itating CaCO, and sequestering carbon—-would act as sinks for
CO,, but on the decade to century timescale this is not the case
(Smith and Buddemeier, 1992). The calcification process actu-
ally generates CO, (Ware et al., 1992), and over periods of
decades reefs may contribute about 0.02 to 0.08 Gt C/yr as CO,

Suharsono, 1990). Such results have been mirrored in studies in
the Galdpagos and eastern Panama, where little recovery has

"Coral reefs are particularly sensitive to increases in seawater
temperature (Brown, 1987) and increased irradiance (Brown et
al., 1994). They respond to the combined effect of irradiance
and temperature elevations by paling in color, or bleaching
(Brown and Ogden, 1993). Corals do not generally bleach in
response to rapid fluctuations in seawater temperature but
rather to departures in temperature above their seasonal maxi-
mum. If the temperature elevation involves a substantial
increase in seawater temperature (3-4°C) for an extended peri-
od (>6 months), considerable coral mortality can ensue (Brown
and Suharsono, 1990). If, however, the temperature increase is
only on the order of 1-2°C and for a limited period, bleached
corals may recover but show reduced growth and impaired
reproductive capabilities (Brown and Ogden, 1993).

Relatively little appears to have been published on the possible

the economic importance of seagrasses, and their ability to trap

slow water movement, and generally serve as natural coastal

"It is now becoming increasingly clear, as Woodroffe (1993,
1994) and Edwards (1995) have observed, that coastal wet-
lands (marshes and mangroves) can undergo a number of
responses to sea-level rise. Responses may be different in
muddy, tide-dominated systems than in more organic systems,
in areas of high or low tide range, and in areas of high or low
sediment and freshwater input. Thus, the balance between
accretion and submergence will be complex, and a range of
morphological responses is likely for different coastal types
and coastal settings. Although some marshes and mangroves
may be under threat from sea-level rise over the next century,
human impact has been the major threat up to the present and
may be far more important locally than climate change in the
long term (Bird, 1993a; WCC’93, 1994). In the case of man-
groves, afforestation programs may be one way to compensate
for natural or human-induced losses, although experiences in
Bangladesh have indicated the difficulties in such a program
(Saenger and Siddigi, 1993). There also is some evidence that
coastal wetlands may experience loss due to short-term
(decadal) acceleration in the rate of sea-level rise (Boesch et
al., 1994; Downs et al., 1994).

Buddemeier (1994) have shown that coral reefs have come
through episodes of severe climate change in the past and
have the necessary resilience to cope with current scenarios
of climate change. However, coral reefs near land masses and
near large population centers will come under greater human
pressure in the future and are likely to be damaged beyond

"In addition to marine systems such as coral reefs, coastal
zones also comprise the adjacent terrestrial environments.
Although scientists have long studied the interactions
between marine and terrestrial systems and have seen the
coastal zone as a discrete entity, it is poorly understood eco-
logically (Ray, 1991). Among all macroscopic organisms,
there are 43 marine phyla and 28 terrestrial phyla; 90% of all
known classes are marine (Reaka-Kudla, 1995). Ray (1991)
has estimated that 80% of marine phyla occur in the coastal
zone, which occupies only 8% of the Earth’s surface, and
argues that the marine portion of the coastal zone is the most
biologically diverse realm on the planet. For example, of the
13,200 species of marine fish, almost 80% are coastal.
Tropical coastal zones are particularly rich, with about
182,000 described species (Reaka-Kudla, 1995); they are
about twice as rich as temperate coasts.

"Coastal zones are sharply subdivided by gradients in geomor-
phic structure and habitat diversity; this enables them to per-
form many of the regulation functions and user and production
functions outlined in Section 9.2.1. Ray (1991) has identified a
nexus between physical processes and ecological pattern and
diversity; he suggests that if global warming accelerates during
the next few decades, the extent of coastal lagoons, marshes,
and so forth will be affected and that these changes will strong-
ly influence the fate of associated biota. In addition, intensive
habitat modification on land and deterioration of coastal areas
will clearly result in a decline of global biodiversity. Similarly,
the capacity of species and ecosystems such as mangroves to
shift their ranges and locations in response to climate change
will be hindered by human land-use practices that have frag-
mented existing habitats. The establishment of nature reserves
is seen as an option to arrest the decline of coastal biodiversity
(Ray and Gregg, 1991; De Groot, 1992b).

"Through the biogeophysical effects on coastal geomorphic and
ecological systems described in Sections 9.4.1 through 9.4.5,
climate change has the potential to significantly affect coastal
biological diversity. It could cause changes in the population
sizes and distributions of species, alter the species composition
and geographical extent of habitats and ecosystems, and
increase the rate of species extinction (Reid and Miller, 1989).
Coral reefs have the highest biodiversity of any marine ecosys-
tem, with enormous numbers of different species packed into
small areas (Norris, 1993). Despite the known and potential
value of reef communities and the threats to their health and
vigor, the total biodiversity of coral reefs is not known, nor is
the fraction of the diversity that is described versus undiscov-
ered. Reaka-Kudla (1995) has estimated that there are about

"Reef accretion rates—calculated from community calcification
rates, growth rates of calcifying organisms, and radiocarbon
dating of cores through reefs—range from less than 1 mm/yr to
a maximum slightly in excess of 10 mm/yr (Buddemeier and
Smith, 1988; Hopley and Kinsey, 1988; Kinsey, 1991). A rate
of 10 mm/yr is commonly taken as the consensus value for the
maximum sustained vertical reef accretion rate (Buddemeier
and Smith, 1988). The present best estimates for global sea-
level rise over the next century (see Section 9.3) are well with-
in the range of typical reef accretion rates. Even slowly accret-
ing reef flats should, on average, be able to keep up with this
rate of sea-level rise after a lag, provided that other factors such
as increased seawater temperatures and damaging anthro-
pogenic influences are not acting simultaneously (Edwards,
1995). Widespread warming of seawater, however, will clearly
limit the accretion rates of coral reefs—as exemplified by the
Panamanian reef, which before suffering 50% coral mortality
as a result of sea-surface warming during an ENSO event was
depositing about 10 tonnes CaCO,/ha/yr and now is eroding at
arate of approximately 2.5 tonnes CaCO,/yr, equivalent to ver-
tical erosion of 6 mm/yr (Eakin, 1995).

irrigation systems) can restrict the supply of water, sediment,
and nutrients to coastal systems. Sewage and siltation are

of the intertidal profiles (see Section 9.4)—is inhibited by flood
embankments and other human constructions. The result is that
erosion of the seaward boundaries of these wetlands will contin-
ue without a compensating landward migration, leading to loss
of wetland area. Deltaic processes also are being modified. In the
United States, for example, the Mississippi River delta was
roughly in a state of dynamic balance before the twentieth cen-

these problems.” Assessments are to “serve as preparatory
studies, identifying priority regions and priority sectors and to
provide a first reconnaissance and screening of possible mea-
sures” (IPCC CZMS, 1991). Three boundary conditions and
scenarios have been specified in the methodology: the impacts
on the natural coastal systems, the impacts on socioeconomic
developments, and the implications of possible response strate-
gies for adaptation. The methodology includes consideration of
the reference (or present) situation and a rise in sea level of
30cm to It m by the year 2100. These scenarios approximate the
low and high estimates of the 1990 IPCC Scientific Assessment.
It considers socioeconomic developments by extrapolating 30
years from the present situation. The Common Methodology
recommends considering a full range of adaptation options,
including at least the extreme options of complete retreat and
total protection. To simplify analysis, the method does not con-

change, nor does it assess the effects of progressive adaptation
at the local scale, such as the raising of dikes.

"Conventional impact evaluation techniques and indicators, such as GNP and population at loss, protection costs, and
cost-benefit analysis, reflect only one (largely Western) approach for assessing potential damages from climate-related
events. This has led to the development of alternative methodologies that seek to assess changes in culture, community,
and habitat. In a study of coastal vulnerability and resilience to sea-level rise and climate change, Fiji is considered
(Nunn et al., 1994a). The methodology (Yamada et al., 1995) computes a Sustainable Capacity Index based on the sum
of ratings of vulnerability and resilience for many categories of cultural, social, agricultural, and industrial impacts at the
local, regional, and national levels. Areas with higher concentrations of assets are judged to be more vulnerable, whereas
areas with diversity and flexibility in the system—whether natural or managerial—tend to be viewed as more resilient in
this analysis. The study has evaluated potential impacts to subsistence economies according to the view that communi-
ties in which people feed and clothe themselves with little cash exchange are more vulnerable but that subsistence
economies in which staples can be replaced with other crops tend to be more resilient. In addition, cultural sites have
been ranked according to the level of national interest in their preservation. The study concludes that subsistence
economies and cultural assets are more vulnerable in Fiji and that conventional analyses of relatively high-lying islands
such as Fiji would tend to underestimate the potential vulnerability of these areas, given that most people live in the low-
lying coastal plain and the majority of cash and subsistence economic activities take place in the low-lying areas.

"Many studies have found the use of a single global sce-
nario of sea-level rise (1 m by 2100) inappropriate to their
respective areas, often due to the lack of more detailed
data on coastal elevations; most studies have ignored the
spatial distribution of relative sea-level rise and other
coastal implications of climate change, largely due to a
lack of regional climate scenarios. Future vulnerability
assessment would be greatly improved by the availabili-
ty of regional scenarios for climate change and sea-level
rise, including reference, low, and high scenarios.
Although the Common Methodology has encouraged
researchers to take into account the biogeophysical response
of the coastal system to sea-level rise, lack of data and mod-
els for describing local coastal processes and responses have
hindered detailed, quantitative impact assessment. Many
case studies have carried out a siraple first-order assessment
""by horizontally shifting the coastline landward by an amount
corresponding with the sea-level rise scenario.

While vulnerability profiles have yielded some useful
relative guidance on potential impacts, the Common
Methodology has been less effective in assessing the
wide range of technical, institutional, economic, and
cultural elements present in different localities.

There has been concern that the methodology stresses a
protection-orientated response, rather than considering
a full range of adaptation options.

Market-evaluation assessment frameworks have proved
inappropriate in many subsistence economies and tradi-
tional land-tenure systems. More attention should be
paid to broader socioeconomic evaluation techniques,

important insights into potential impacts and possible respons-

bility assessments emphasize the severe nature of existing
coastal problems such as beach erosion, waterlogging, and pol-
lution (e.g., El-Raey et al., 1995; Han et al., 1995b). For many
small islands, population pressure and urbanization, coastal
pollution, and overexploitation of resources already are critical
problems. For deltas and estuaries, changes in sediment supply
and distribution are often already causing significant changes
in the coastal zone. This reinforces the message that climate
change will act on coastal systems that are already under stress.

"In addition to accelerated sea-level rise, there is widespread
concern about the coastal implications of other aspects of cli-
mate change such as changing rainfall and runoff in the catch-
ment area, as well as the effects of changes in storminess and
storm surges (e.g., Warrick et al., 1993; McLean and Mimura,
1993), One quantitative vulnerability assessment study exists;
it shows that in The Netherlands the costs of avoiding damage
related to an adverse 10% change in the direction and intensi-
ty of storms may be worse than those of a 60-cm rise in sea
level (Peerbolte et al., 1991). This storm-change scenario is
arbitrary, but shows that concern is justified and that there is a

"limiting vertical accretion rates and potential for wetland
migration often are poorly defined (Nicholls, 1995). The study
of the United States has considered wetland migration, esti-
mating that a 50-cm rise in sea level would erode or inundate
38% to 61% of existing coastal wetlands. Assuming that dikes
or bulkheads were not built to impede inland migration, new
wetland formation on formerly upland areas would reduce the
total loss to 17% to 43% (Titus et al., 1991). Therefore, wet-
land migration is not projected to compensate for losses, even
under the most ideal circumstances. Many studies, however,
have found that direct human reclamation of wetlands for a
range of purposes at present is a much bigger threat than sea-
level rise (Nicholis and Leatherman, 1995a).

protect tourist infrastructure because existing urban and tourist
infrastructure could be damaged and destroyed. The amount of
sand required to maintain a beach in the face of long-term sea-

the costs of beach nourishment could dominate basic response
costs if countries invest in such an adaptation option (Dennis et
al., 1995b; Nicholls and Leatherman, 1995a; Volonté and
Nicholls, 1995). There is also the question of the availability of
sufficient sand resources. The usual source is suitable-grade
nearshore deposits, if available. However, the implication of
the removal of such deposits must be carefully considered in

loss of land and other assets may stimulate macroeconomic
effects within national economies. Some assets may be relo-
cated and others may be adapted to reduce the damage impli-
cations of climate change. On the other hand, the damage-cost
estimates may represent underestimates because they neglect
some nonmarket asset values and factors such as the cost of
resettlement of coastal populations that cannot be easily pro-
tected. Finally, it has been assumed that the rise in sea level
will be a slow, gradual process, which may not be the case for
all regions. Scientific uncertainties are compounded by the
socioeconomic adaptation uncertainties referred to above and
by the fact that economic cost estimates are very sensitive to

"Fifteen case studies have provided estimates of undiscounted
capital value potentially at loss, assuming no protection.
Nearly half of the studies have concluded that capital value at
loss could exceed 50% of present GNP, illustrating the con-
centration of infrastructure and economic activity in the coastal
zones of many of the countries studied. To counter these
impacts, adaptation would be expected (see Section 9.6). Table
9-3 stresses the cost of total protection rather than other possi-
ble adaptation options, which may have lower costs. Assuming
that costs will accrue uniformly over 100 years, the annual pro-
tection costs—as a percentage of present GNP—are highest for
the Marshall Islands at 7% (Holthus er al., 1992) and St. Kitts-
Nevis at 2.7% (Cambers, 1994). This supports the conclusion
that some small islands have a high vulnerability to sea-level
tise. However, Kiribati has a similar setting to the Marshall
Islands, yet the estimates of protection costs are much smaller,
at 0.1% of present GNP (Woodroffe and McLean, 1992). This
reflects important differences in assumptions about the mean-
ing of total protection. In Kiribati, local engineers have select-
ed existing low-technology, low-cost gabions to protect the
atoll, whereas in the Marshall Islands large and expensive sea
walls have been utilized to determine the costs. This compari-
son shows one of the weaknesses of the Common
Methodology and the need to assess a wider range of response
options in future vulnerability assessment studies.

analysis are limited, and important assumptions are necessary
with regard to storm-surge probability and population distribu-
tion. Also, increases in wave height and wave run-up have not
been taken into account in these analyses, and neither have
socioeconomic changes such as population growth. Therefore,
the results of both studies must be considered as first-order

"Given accelerated sea-level rise, first-order estimates suggest that substantial investment would be required in some
developing countries in order to protect urban areas and maintain related activities such as beach tourism. Nine small
island states appear in the list of countries facing the highest coastal protection costs as a percentage of their GNP. The
global average percentage required annually for coastal protection is 0.037%; however, for many small islands it is sig-
nificantly higher—up to 34% for the Maldives (OECD, 1991), To explore the full range of potential responses, more
comprehensive assessment of the available adaptation options in these vulnerable settings is urgently required.

"The available case studies have shown that small islands—most particularly, coral atolls such as the Marshall Islands
(Holthus et al., 1992)—are heavily oriented toward coastal activities and hence are vulnerable to sea-level rise (e.g.,
Cambers, 1994; Fifita et al., 1994). At the same time, their relatively small economies may make the costs of adaptation
prohibitive. In global terms, the population of small islands is relatively small, but a number of distinct societies and cul-
tures are threatened with drastic changes in lifestyle and possibly forced abandonment from aricestral homelands if sea
level rises significantly (Roy and Connell, 1991).

"Many small island countries could lose a significant part of their land area with a sea-level rise of 50 cm to 1 m. The
Maldives, for example, have average elevations of | to 1.5 m above existing sea level (Pernetta, 1992). Although bio-
geophysical processes may counter land losses (see Section 9.4), the threat of submergence and erosion remains; this
could convert many small islands to sandbars and significantly reduce the usable dry land on the larger, more populated
islands. Saltwater intrusion and loss of the freshwater lens may be an equally binding constraint on human habitation in
some islands, particularly smaller atolls (Leatherman, 1994).

"Even the less-vulnerable small islands would suffer significant economic effects from the loss of beach tourism and
recreation areas because of sea-level rise and, possibly, more storms leading to increased beach and reef erosion. In
1988, among the Caribbean islands, income from tourism as a percentage of GNP was 69% for Antigua and Barbuda and
53% for the Bahamas; for a dozen other Caribbean islands, tourism revenues make up more than 10% of the GNP
(Hameed, 1993). The Indian Ocean islands of the Seychelles and the Maldives also have seen a steady growth in
tourism. In 1991, total receipts from tourism generated foreign exchange earnings of $94 million in the Maldives. This
represented some 74% of the country’s total foreign exchange earnings. Since 1985, tourism has been the single biggest
contributor to the GNP of the Maldives. Tourism to developing countries has increased significantly in recent years, and
small island developing states have experienced a particularly rapid increase. Tourist numbers to Mauritius, for example,
have increased from 1,800 visitors in 1968 to 180,000 in 1988 (UNEP, 1991).

further utility for countries and areas where none has yet been

Even in many areas with a completed vulnerability assess-

awakened awareness of the vulnerability of the world’s coastal
regions in general—and to low-lying coasts, tidal deltas, and

accommodate, and protect. The first involves strategic retreat
from or the prevention of future major developments in coastal
areas that may be impacted. The second includes adaptive
responses such as elevation of buildings, modification of
drainage systems, and land-use changes. Both strategies are
based on the premise that increases in land loss and coastal
flooding will be allowed to occur and that some coastal func-

strategies help to maintain the dynamic nature of coastal
ecosystems and thus allow them to adapt naturally. The third

"Presently, some 200 million people are estimated to
live below the “maximum” storm-surge level (the
once-per-1000-years storm-surge level). Based on this
population estimate, as well as on first-order esti-
mates of storm-surge probabilities and existing levels
of protection, 46 million people are estimated to expe-
rience flooding due to storm surge in an average year
under present conditions. Most of these people live in
the developing world.

The present number of people at risk will double if
sea level rises 50 cm (92 million people/yr) and
almost triple if it rises 1 m (118 million people/yr).
The average number of people who will experience
coastal flooding more than once per year will
increase considerably under both scenarios (80-90%
of the respective populations at risk). This estimate
underlines that many people will have to adapt to
sea-level rise by moving to higher ground, increasing
protection efforts or other adaptation options (see
Section 9.6).

Because of regional differences in storm-surge
regimes, the increase of flood risk due to sea-level
tise is greater than average for the Asian region
(especially the Indian Ocean coast), the south
Mediterranean coast, the African Atlantic and Indian
Ocean coasts, Caribbean coasts, and many of the
small islands.

All over the world, coastal wetlands are presently
being lost at an increasingly rapid rate, averaging
0.5-1.5% per year. These losses are closely connect-
ed with human activities such as shoreline protection,
blocking of sediment sources, and development activ-
ities such as land reclamation, aquaculture develop-
ment, and oil, gas, and water extraction.

Sea-level rise would increase the rate of net coastal
wetland loss, Losses of coastal wetlands of interna-
tional importance are expected to be greater than
average for the coasts of the United States, the
Mediterranean Sea, the African Atlantic coast, the
coast of East Asia, and the Australian and Papua New
Guinean coast.

Approximately 85% of the world’s rice production
takes place in South, Southeast, and East Asia.
About 10% of this production is located in areas that
are considered to be vulnerable to sea-level rise,
thereby endangering the food supply of more than
200 million people.

Less-favorable hydraulic conditions may cause lower
rice production yields if no adaptive measures are
taken, especially in the large deltas of Vietnam,
Bangladesh, and Myanmar.

"From Section 9.5, four major areas of concern regarding sea-level
rise have emerged: inundation and increased flooding of low-lying
islands, inundation and increased flooding of large parts of dense-
ly populated deltaic areas, loss of coastal wetlands, and erosion of
developed sandy coasts. Each of these areas may require different
options to reduce or prevent the prospective adverse impacts asso-
ciated with biogeophysical changes caused by climate change and
sea-level rise. In addition, strategies to reduce the vulnerability of
coastal zones and small islands to climate change and sea-level
rise should not be seen independently of the resolution of short-
term problems arising primarily from human activities. Effective
adaptation to climate change and sea-level rise therefore requires
a flexible coastal management strategy at all timescales, that
incorporates and integrates both short-term and long-term goals.

Cameroon, Gabon, Angola) have mostly. low-lying lagoonal, erosive coasts—and hence are likely to be threatened by
sea-level rise, particularly since most of the countries in this area have major, rapidly expanding cities on the coast
(Tobor and Ibe, 1990; Adam, 1995; Dennis et al., 1995b; G.T. French et al., 1995). Ibe (1990) has found that large-scale
protective engineering measures are impractical in the region because of the high costs to those countries. Instead, low-
cost, low-technology, but effective measures—such as permeable nonconcrete floating breakwaters; artificial raising of
beach elevations; installation of riprap; timber groins; and so forth—are considered to be more sensible. Ibe (1990) has
noted that “fortunately, outside the urbanized centers, the coasts are almost in pristine condition and largely uninhabited.
Where coasts are deemed highly vulnerable, total ban of new development is absolutely necessary.”

storm patterns (i.e., wind direction, storm frequency and intensity). Possible adaptation options, including investments in
infrastructure and soft measures such as beach and dune nourishment, have been evaluated and optimized in time for the
different sets of scenarios. If sea level were to rise by 60 cm over the next century, $3.5 billion would have to be spent
on raising dikes and other safety infrastructure, $500 million on preserving the dune areas, $900 million on adapting
flood-prone residential and industrial areas and harbors, and $800 million on adapting water-management facilities. An
unfavorable change in storm pattern alone would have the same magnitude of impacts. The occurrence of sea-level rise

options have not been fully evaluated but appear limited and
potentially very costly. Even without climate change and asso-

rapidly increasing vulnerability to natural coastal hazards due
to high rates of population growth, increased demands, contin-

"Heavily populated areas are primary candidates for structural
protection measures such as dikes, sea walls, breakwaters, and
beach groins. Because these are expensive options, the use of
economic evaluation principles—especially risk assessment and
benefit-cost analysis—can provide useful tools in deciding
whether to protect or retreat, as well as where such infrastructure
investments ought to be placed in order to maximize national or
regional social and economic welfare (Carter et al., 1994).

"Some of the more detailed recent studies of response strategies
to sea-level rise have been accomplished for coastal urban
areas. In all instances, the problems of sea-level rise are con-
sidered to be serious. Many examples can be found in Frassetto
(1991) and Nicholls and Leatherman (1995a), including
Venice, Hamburg, London, Osaka, St. Petersburg, Shanghai,
Hong Kong, Lagos, Alexandria, Recife, and Tianjin. However,
Devine (1992) has argued that the shantytown areas found in
many coastal cities may be particularly vulnerable to climate
change, and adaptation options are uncertain. Chapter 12 fur-
ther discusses impacts of and adaptation options to climate
change in human settlements, including coastal cities.
"	List
"Enlarged setbacks to allow for expected shoreline recession,
most notably in some states in Australia (Caton and Eliot, 1993),
would enable planned retreat to accommodate climate change
impacts. A variant on fixed setbacks is presumed mobility—
whereby coastal residents are allowed to live at the shore but
give up their right to protect the shore if it retreats in response to
climate change or other causes (Titus, 1991). To counter the
coastal squeeze of wetlands and maintain their habitat and flood-
buffering functions, managed retreat on estuarine shorelines is
increasingly favored in the United Kingdom (Burd, 1995). This
involves setting back the line of actively maintained defense to
a new line inland of the original and promoting the creation of
intertidal habitat on the land between the old and new defenses.
"	Text
"Adaptation can exploit the fact that coastal infrastructure is not
static. There is a turnover of many coastal facilities through
major rehabilitation, construction, and technological changes
in ports, harbors, and urbanized areas, averaging roughly
25-30 years. Therefore, there will be recurring opportunities to
adapt to sea-level rise, especially if the rate is relatively slow
and construction and maintenance plans can be taken into
account in land-use planning, management, and engineering
design criteria (Stakhiv et al., 1991; Yim, 1995). Moreover,
experience with allowances for accelerated sea-level rise is
limited but growing (e.g., Nicholls and Leatherman, 1995b).
The interaction of different aspects of climate change should
be considered. For instance, given the likelihood of both sea-
level rise and a decrease in the return period of intense rainfall

"To date, the assessment of possible response strategies has
focused mainly on protection. There is a need to better identi-
fy the full range of options within the adaptive response strate-
gies: protect, accommodate, and retreat. Identifying the most
appropriate options and their relative costs and implementing
these options while taking into account contemporary condi-
tions as well as future problems such as climate change and
sea-level rise will be a great challenge in both developing and
industrialized countries. The range of options will vary among
and within countries, and different socioeconomic sectors may
prefer competing adaptation options for the same areas.
Experience shows that intersectoral conflicts are a major bar-
rier to improved coastal management (WCC’93, 1994). In the
present context, they could also be a major barrier to adapta-
tion to climate change. An appropriate mechanism for coastal

"Kitajima et al. (1993) have undertaken a comprehensive analy-
sis of the range of likely structural measures that would be
required to respond to a 1-m sea-level rise at 1,100 Japanese
ports, harbors, and neighboring areas, as well as their estimated
costs. The cumulative undiscounted costs have been estimated at
$92 billion. Of that sum, about $63 billion is for raising port
facilities and $29 billion is for adjoining shore protection struc-
tures (e.g., breakwaters, jetties, embankments). This cost esti-
mate covers about 25% of Japan’s coastline; other residential
areas would also have to be protected, if that were the most cost-
effective option. Further costs would be incurred to maintain
existing standards of protection for populated areas as sea level
rises (Mimura et al., 1994). For a rise of 1 m, total costs would
exceed $150 million. Further, natural shores could be largely lost
from Japan’s coast. It should be noted that, on an average annu-
al basis, the costs constitute a small fraction of the GNP.

"In the early 1990s, design standards for new seawalls
in The Netherlands and eastern England were raised
66 cm and 25 cm, respectively, to allow for accelerat-
ed sea-level rise. This has been in response to the
IPCC90 best estimate for future sea-level rise; the dif-
ferent magnitudes reflect a 100-year and 50-year
planning horizon, respectively.

The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority has
included an additional 46 cm of height in the Deer
Istand sewage treatment plant. This is a safety factor
to maintain gravity-based flows under higher sea lev-
els without the additional costs of pumping.

In Hong Kong, the West Kowloon reclamation is
being built 80 cm above earlier design levels to allow
for sea-level rise and/or unanticipated subsidence
(Yim, 1995). In this case, costs have increased by less
than 1%; future reclamations are expected to be simi-
larly raised, and existing reclamations may be raised
as part of the redevelopment cycle.

resources, while taking into account traditional, cultural, and historical perspectives and conflicting interests and uses. It
is an iterative and evolutionary process for achieving sustainable development by developing and implementing a contin-

includes the following:

resources continue to grow with increasing population and
economic development, conflicts could become more com-
mon and apparent. ICZM should resolve these conflicts and
implement decisions on the mix of uses that best serve the
needs of society now and in the future. Also, ICZM is impor-
tant in the context of the increasingly expressed concern for
sustainable development. Sustainable use of any natural
resource can be achieved only by having in place a set of inte-
grated management tasks that are financed and carried out
continuously (WCC’93, 1994).
"	Text
"There is a persuasive case for taking action about climate
change now—to institute or expand ICZM and thus comply
with the precautionary approach. Although the time lag
between planning and investment in integrated (cross-sectoral)
management is longer than that for single-sector management,
the returns are significantly greater. A proactive approach to
ICZM, in order to enhance the resilience of natural coastal sys-
tems and reduce vulnerability, would be beneficial from both
an environmental and an economic perspective (Jansen et al.,
1995), In addition to reducing vulnerability and enhancing the
resilience of developed coastal regions, such initiatives also
can encompass the large lengths of shorelines that are present-
ly undeveloped but may be subject to significant pressures in
the coming decades. By acting now, future development may
be designed to be sustainable and to accommodate the poten-
tial impacts of climate change and sea-level rise.

"There is no single recipe for ICZM; rather it constitutes a port-
folio of sociocultural dimensions and structural, legal, finan-
cial, economic, and institutional measures. There are many
approaches as well as diverse institutional arrangements that
can be tailored to the particular culture and style of gover-
nance. Yet a number of essential prerequisites can be identified
(WCC’93, 1994). The first of these is the need for initial lead-
ership for the planning process. The initiative may consist of a
centrally led “top-down” approach, a community-based “bot-
tom-up” approach, or something in between. The second nec-
essary element of ICZM is the provision of institutional
arrangements. This may involve creating new institutions but
more commonly will involve improving horizontal and vertical
linkages between existing ones. Third, technical capacity (both
technological and human capacities) is necessary for compiling
inventories in the planning phase and during the implementa-
tion of the program, and for monitoring the changes. The final
necessary element of ICZM is management instruments. These
include tools ranging from directive to incentive-based, all
with the aim of encouraging stakeholders to comply with the
goals and objectives of the given ICZM program.

"For many countries, scarcity of (or lack of access to) appropri-
ate technology and trained personnel will impose limits on the
adaptation options realistically available. For example, the
design, implementation, and maintenance of “state-of-the-art”
civil works may be beyond the immediate reach of many
developing nations unless there is technical assistance to pro-
vide the required technology and human skills. This is high-
lighted in vulnerability assessments for a number of countries,
such as Tonga (Fifita et al., 1994), Bangladesh (Khan et al.,
1994), and Belize (Pernetta and Elder, 1993).

"increasingly have to turn to donor countries and international
agencies for assistance. In Kiribati, for instance, it has been
demonstrated that implementation of protection measures
especially will almost certainly require external assistance
(Abete, 1993). Lack of adequate financia! resources will also
circumscribe a country’s capacity to “purchase” appropriate
technology and human skills required for the implementation
of various options. Countries should therefore consider design-
ing efficient, least-cost response plans, based on some realistic
assessment of what their economies will be able to sustain
(WCC’93, 1994).
"	Text
"Although certain options may be technically and financially
possible in a given set of circumstances, they may, at the same
time, be culturally and socially disruptive. In some societies,
resettlement, for example, would lead to dislocation of social
and cultural groups and might even involve the loss of cultur-
al norms and values and the assimilation of new ones.
Additionally, an option involving planned retreat could mean
the loss of access to communally owned resources and land
entitlements, which might undermine the entire economic,
social, and cultural base of some communities. Other adaptive
measures, such as the construction of “hard” engineering struc-
tures, could cause the partial or total elimination of access to
traditional fishing, hunting, and culturally important sites.
"	Text
"The extent to which a given response strategy can be successful-
ly employed may well be influenced by political and legal con-
siderations (Freestone and Pethick, 1990). Retreat options, for
example, might prove infeasible given the policy and legal struc-
tures of the “receiving” area. Where international resettlement is
indicated, these issues can become even more complex—as
demonstrated by the plight of refugees worldwide. Further, some
options will be incompatible with existing systems of land tenure
and ownership and in some societies would necessitate a funda-
mental change in arrangements prior to implementation to avoid
violating certain rights, Failing this, governments could be called
upon to provide substantial compensation to communities for loss
of property and resource-use rights.
"	Text
"The implementation of any adaptation option—whether
Tetreat, accommodate, or protect—will necessitate certain
financial commitments from governments, although the level
of required funding may vary widely from one option to anoth-
er. In the case of planned retreat, substantial infrastructure
would have to be rebuilt and settlements relocated to less-
vulnerable areas, at high reinvestment costs. Adjustment strate-
gies might entail acceptance of less-than-ideal circumstances,
while simultaneously increasing the costs of reducing flood
risks. Protection strategies almost always involve “hard” engi-
neering structures, which are costly both to construct and to
maintain. In the Maldives, for example, the present costs of
shoreline protection are close to $13,000 per m; in Senegal,
Benin, Antigua, Egypt, Guyana, the Marshall Islands, St. Kitts-
Nevis, and Uruguay, maintenance of the existing shoreline
against a 1-m rise in sea level could require substantial funding
compared with the nation’s GNP (Nicholls, 1995). However, it
should be noted that national responses to climate change will
more likely comprise a variable combination of planned
retreat, accommodation, and protection; hence, lower-cost
responses probably are available in some areas (e.g., Turner et
al., 1995a; Volonté and Nicholls, 1995).

change will influence freshwater ecosystems directly

"There are considerable differences in estimated changes in
hydrological behavior both between scenarios and between
catchments, but it is possible to draw some general conclusions
about sensitivities:

"Freshwater ecosystems, including lakes and streams (covered
in this chapter) and noncoastal wetlands (see Chapter 6), are
scattered across the landscape and tightly linked to regional
hydrology. The effects of climate change on freshwater ecolo-
gy will interact strongly with other anthropogenic changes in
land use, waste disposal, and water extraction. Changes in lake
and stream ecosystems will occur in the context of existing cli-
mates and expected changes; effects will differ greatly from
place to place. General conclusions follow:
"	Text
"The hydrological system is potentially very sensitive to
changes in climate. Changes in precipitation affect the magni-
tude and timing of runoff and the frequency and intensity of
floods and droughts; changes in temperature result in changes
in evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and infiltration. The
resulting changes in surface wetness, reflectivity, and vegeta-
tion affect evapotranspiration and the formation of clouds, as
well as surface net radiation and precipitation. Meanwhile, the
hydrological system is being affected by other, more direct
human activities, such as deforestation, urbanization, and
water-resource exploitation.
"	Text
"We have a high level of confidence that an increase in
air temperature would increase potential evapotranspi-
ration, but the magnitude of increase depends also on
changes in net radiation, humidity, windspeed, precipi-
tation and its temporal distribution, and vegetation char-
acteristics. Actual evapotranspiration may increase or
decrease according to the availability of soil moisture.
The effect of a given change in precipitation and
evapotranspiration on river runoff and groundwater
recharge varies considerably between catchments,
depending on climatic regime and (at shorter time
scales) catchment physical characteristics. We have a
high level of confidence that, in general, the drier the
climate, the greater the sensitivity of hydrological
regimes to changes in climate.
"	List
"The effects of climate change on hydrological regimes are gen-
erally estimated by combining catchment-scale hydrological
models with climate change scenarios derived from general
circulation model (GCM) output. In addition to the uncertain-
ties associated with GCM simulations, there are three major
problems in estimating the hydrological effects of climate
change: (1) expressing scenarios at a scale appropriate for
hydrological modeling; (2) the considerable errors inherent in
climatic and hydrological data used to validate hydrological
models; and (3) converting climatic inputs into hydrological
responses. Methods have been developed to address most of
these problems, but estimates of the hydrological effects of cli-
mate change remain very uncertain. This uncertainty is largely
due to difficulties in defining credible scenarios for changes in
precipitation and assessing vegetation response to a changed
atmosphere at appropriate spatial scales.
"	Text
"Neither climatic nor hydrological change will be
equally distributed throughout the year; in some cases
it appears that the variability of river flow through the
year would increase if climate were to change, and the
frequency of both high and low flows would increase.
We have a medium level of confidence in this finding,
due to variations between catchments and scenarios.
We have a medium level of confidence that more
intense rainfall would tend to increase the occurrence
of floods, although the magnitude of this effect would
depend not only on the change in rainfall but also on
catchment physical and biologic characteristics. These
characteristics also may change due to human activity
that may or may not be in response to climate change.
An increase in the duration of dry spells would not
necessarily lead to an increase in the occurrence of
low river flows and groundwater levels. River flows
may be sustained by increased precipitation earlier in
the year. The effect of a change in the duration of dry
spells depends significantly on catchment physical
and biologic characteristics. We have a medium level
of confidence in these findings.

Hydrological regimes in many continental and moun-
tain areas are determined by winter snowfall and spring
snowmelt; if climate were to change and the proportion
of precipitation falling as snow decreased, we have a
high degree of confidence that in such regions there
would be a widespread shift from spring to winter
runoff. This effect may be modified by changes in the
seasonal distribution and amounts of precipitation.
Very little is known about possible changes in ground-
water recharge, which will depend on the balance
between changes in opportunities for recharge and the
amount of water available for recharge. Therefore, we
have a low level of confidence in any conclusions about
or projections of changes in groundwater recharge.
"	List
"Water quality will be affected by changes in water temperature,
CO, concentration, the processes by which water gets into the
stream network and aquifers, and the timing and volume of
streamflow. The relative importance of these influences varies
between catchments and chemical species, and the influences
interact to ameliorate or exaggerate the effects of change.
Dissolved oxygen concentrations would not change much if
higher water temperatures were associated with increased
streamflow, but if streamflow were to decline there would be a
large decrease in dissolved oxygen concentrations. In many
catchments, stream and groundwater quality is determined by
human influences—such as the application of agricultural
chemicals, urbanization, and the return of treated sewage. The
water quality of streams that already are polluted is likely to be
affected by changes in temperature and flow regimes, but
changes in land use and the input of pollutants may have a far
greater effect than changes in climate.

"greater ecological effects than climate changes asso-
ciated with a change in average conditions; increased
variability in hydrologic conditions with associated
flash floods and droughts will reduce the biological
diversity and productivity of stream ecosystems.

We have a high level of confidence that assemblages
of organisms will tend to move poleward with warm-
ing, with range constrictions and local and global
species extinctions occurring at the lower latitudes of
their distributions and range extensions and invasions
occurring poleward. For smaller, more hydrologically
isolated basins, dispersal will lag considerably behind
the warming in climate—resulting in near-term reduc-
tions in diversity.

We can say with a lower degree of confidence that
warming of larger and deeper temperate lakes may
increase their productivity, provided that nutrient
inputs are not greatly reduced; in some shallow, strat-
ified lakes, this increase in productivity would lead to
a greater likelihood of anoxic conditions in deep
water, with subsequent loss of cold-water fauna.

We have a medium level of confidence that changes in
vegetation, in rainfall, and in hydrological regimes
affect erosion on hillslopes and in river channels, sed-
imentation, and channel stability.

regimes, water levels, and, in the extreme, the absence
of water in streambeds and lake basins.

We have a high level of confidence that changes in
water temperature and thermal structure of freshwa-
ters directly affect the survival, reproduction, and
growth of organisms; productivity of ecosystems; per-
sistence and diversity of species; and regional distrib-
ution of biota.

We have a high level of confidence that changes in
runoff, groundwater inputs, and direct precipitation to
lakes and streams will alter the input of nutrients and
dissolved organic carbon, which in turn will alter pro-
ductivity and clarity. Changes in the duration of lake
and stream ice and snow on ice will change mixing
patterns, oxygen availability, and the survival and
reproductive success of certain organisms.

We have a medium level of confidence that increases
in terrestrial productivity will enhance the productiv-
ity of streams by increasing the input of organic detri-
tus and likely increasing the export of CO, from lakes
to the atmosphere.

We have a medium level of confidence that climate-
induced changes in temperature, ice and snow cover,
and biological production will be more intense at
higher latitudes—where temperature changes are
expected to be greatest—and at the lower-latitude
edges of the geographic ranges of many taxa—where
extinctions and extirpations will be the greatest, espe-
cially where isolation prevents the poleward dispersal
of organisms in rivers and streams.

We have a high level of confidence that water-level
declines will be most severe in lakes and streams in
dry evaporative drainages and in basins with small
catchments—where in many years evapotranspiration
losses already exceed precipitation and inputs from
groundwater plus overland flow.

We have a high level of confidence that the effects of an
increase in severe flood events may be more damaging
in drier climates where soils are more erodible and pre-
cipitation-runoff relationships are highly nonlinear.
Drought events may be more severe in humid areas that
have not experienced frequent droughts in the past.

linked. Any change in climate is reflected in changes in key
hydroclimatic elements of the hydrological cycle and vice
versa: Changes in precipitation affect the magnitude and tim-
ing of runoff and groundwater recharge, as well as the fre-
quency and intensity of floods and droughts; changes in tem-
perature result in changes in evapotranspiration, soil moisture,

wetness, reflectivity, and vegetation that affect evaporation and
the formation of clouds, as well as surface net radiation and—

"This chapter examines the sensitivities of hydrological and
freshwater systems to climate change. The chapter covers four
main issues: (1) the potential effects of global warming on
components of the hydrological cycle; (2) possible changes in
the frequency and magnitude of extreme high and low flows;
(3) implications for thermal, chemical, and morphological
changes; and (4) consequences for stream and lake ecosystems.
The consequences of changes in freshwater systems affecting
water resources, ecosystem management, agriculture, power
production, and navigation are examined in other chapters of
this report.

"The hydrological cycle is driven by solar energy and involves
water changing its form through the oceans, atmosphere, land
and vegetation, and ice and glaciers. After precipitation water
reaches the Earth’s surface, it either remains on the surface as
rain or snow; quickly evaporates; infiltrates into the soil, where
it is taken up by vegetation (and eventually transpired through
photosynthesis and respiration); moves along the surface or
through the soil toward rivers and streams; or percolates to
aquifers, recharging groundwater and subsequently draining
into rivers and oceans, perhaps after delays of years or cen-
turies. Some water is stored over the winter as snow and over
longer time scales as ice.
"	Text
"Freshwater ecosystems include lakes, streams, and wetlands
scattered across the landscape and are tightly linked to regional
hydrology. These surface freshwater systems constitute a set of
scarce resources for humans sensitive to climate change;
excluding ice, they constitute only 0.009% of the volume of
water on Earth (Goldman and Horne, 1983). Of these surface
freshwaters, 99% (by volume) are lakes and 1% are streams.
Groundwater is 66 times more abundant than surface freshwa-
ters but still represents only 0.6% of the volume of all surface
waters. Freshwater systems greatly influence the distribution of
populations and economic growth, add greatly to the biological
and ecological diversity of the landscape, and provide a variety
of goods and services. The effects of climate change on fresh-
water ecosystems will interact strongly with anthropogenic
changes in land use, waste disposal, and water extraction.
"	Text
"Although some of the principal linkages between climate and
the hydrological system are well understood, predicting the
effects of global warming is very uncertain. Current general
circulation models (GCMs) work at a spatial resolution that is
too coarse for hydrological purposes, producing weather aver-
aged over too large a geographic area and producing average
conditions rather than changes in ranges, frequencies, seasonal
distributions, and so forth. They do not yet include all of the
relevant feedbacks between the land surface and the atmos-
phere. There is considerable uncertainty in the translation of
climate changes into hydrological effects through hydrological
models and an inability to maintain consistency between GCM
and hydrological model water balances, particularly for evapo-
ration. Different models give different sensitivities to change,
and a model calibrated under current conditions may not be
appropriate under a changed climate. There still are major

"The partitioning of incoming precipitation between storage,
evaporation, infiltration, groundwater recharge, and runoff
varies widely between catchments, depending on climatic and
catchment characteristics. Vegetation cover has a major effect
on the water and energy balance, particularly through intercep-
tion and evaporation. There are many types of hydrological
regimes with different combinations of processes, but it helps
to distinguish among three major types: snow-dominated,
humid, and semi-arid/arid. In the first regime, a significant pro-
portion of precipitation falls as snow and is stored on the sur-
face until it melts during the spring. In a humid regime, rainfall
infiltrates into the soil and reaches the stream network by a
variety of routes over different time scales. In semi-arid and
arid environments, rainfall is short-lived and generally very
intense, and soils tend to be thin. A large proportion of rainfall .
therefore runs directly off the surface, only to infiltrate into
deeper soils downslope or along the river bed.

"Figure 10-1 attempts to summarize the relative magnitude of
the uncertainties. Given that a reasonably realistic hydrological
model is used, the greatest uncertainty in hydrological climate-

from GCMs—which do not include all of the relevant feed-
backs between the land surface and the atmosphere—and the
derivation of catchment-scale climate scenarios. Sections

the effect depends on the degree and extent of change, as well
as local climatic characteristics. It is increasingly clear that
hydrological variability can be interpreted in terms of large-
scale climatic anomalies—such as those associated with the El

relationships between hydrological anomalies in different parts

increases or decreases in river infiltration to ground-

Impacts of land use and land-use changes:
Anthropogenic activities that affect the land surface
include urbanization; agricultural activities such as
irrigation, drainage, land improvement, and the appli-

"Hydrological models have been used to a large extent to determine
the relative sensitivity of hydrological variables to climatic inputs.
These simulations have been useful in the search for amplification
effects—that is, whether small changes in one (climatic) variable
may cause substantial changes in another variable, thus aggravat-
ing water problems particularly in areas that are presently vulner-
able. Such a sensitivity analysis allows assessment of the impact
of the relative increase or change in temperature and precipitation
on changes in hydrological variables of interest (¢.g., runoff, evap-
transpiration, soil moisture, flood potential). Results of sensitivi-
ty analyses are useful in practical “what-if? considerations.
Sensitivity analyses also underscore uncertainty in the prediction
of future water resources. They may include inconsistencies by
ignoring other important climatic variables that may be affected
by climate change, such as net radiation, wind, and humidity.

MacCracken, 1991). Although GCMs are unanimous in their pro-
jections that a doubling of current atmospheric CO, concentra-

precipitation, they differ in their projections of changes in temper-
ature and precipitation at regional scales that are the same order of
magnitude as projected global changes. The direct use of GCM
output to drive hydrological models is considered inappropriate
due to the coarse resolution of the spatial grids used by current
GCMs (relative to the scale of river basins); the simplified GCM
representations of topography, land surface and cloud processes,
and energy transfer within the oceans; and the simplified coupling
of the atmosphere and the oceans. Until recent GCM transient

"Current approaches to hydrological modeling for climate-change
impact assessment include empirical models, water-balance mod-
els, conceptual rainfall-runoff models, and physically based, dis-
tributed models (Leavesley, 1994). Empirical models consider
Statistical relations between annual runoff and precipitation, tem-
perature, or potential or actual evapotranspiration for present-day
conditions (Revelie and Waggoner, 1983; Arnell, 1992; Duell,
1994). Runoff under changed climate conditions is obtained from
regression models by perturbing historical climate series. This
approach assumes that the functional form as well as the parame-
ters of a regression model remain valid for a changed climate.
Leavesley (1994) has questioned the validity of this approach,
and Arnell (1992) has shown that it should be used with extreme
caution because the estimated sensitivities to change are very
dependent on details of the model. Water-balance and conceptual
rainfall-runoff models simulate the movement of water from the
time it enters a catchment as precipitation to the time it leaves the
catchment as runoff, although rainfall-runoff models consider the
flow paths and residence times of water in finer detail (Leavesley,

"The development of a large-scale model of land-surface
hydrology may be started from an even larger-scale continuum
of atmospheric processes, which is how GCM researchers were
proceeding until recently. In this approach, it is necessary to
simplify the spatial distribution of variables of the land surface
to an extent that not only distorts their physical significance but
provides spatially imprecise inputs to the atmospheric models
at the land-atmosphere interface. This problem has been iden-
tified by GCM researchers in studies of the regional aspects of
changes in climatic variables. Another way to solve the prob-
lem is to develop a macroscale model, starting from mesoscale
analysis of hydrological processes, as practiced by hydrolo-
gists in simulations for water resources management purposes.
Although the call for such an approach is being heard more and
more frequently, a model. of this type is not yet available.

"calibrated water-balance or conceptual rainfall-runoff models are
not directly usable for assessing climate-change impacts because
the model parameter estimates are assumed to remain valid for
the changed climate. This point was illustrated by Gan and
Burges (1990), who found that the calibrated sizes of conceptual
moisture storages are not climate-invariant. The size of this prob-
lem can be checked, at least approximately, by comparing model
prediction errors based on parameters estimated from wet and dry
periods within historical records. Physically based models appear
to be a superior alternative because their parameters are estimat-
ed from field measurements or physically based analyses. These
models use physically based process equations to simulate the
spatial variability of runoff due to spatial variations in land char-
acteristics such as soil type and topography, as well as rainfall.
Although physically based models have the potential to become
a universally applicable tool, they come with the price of
increased model complexity, data requirements, and computing
costs. In practice, there is a paucity of measured field data and a
lack of methods for the collection of data at a scale appropriate
for such models, limiting their application to studies of small-
catchment hydrology (Grayson et al., 1992a, 1992b).

"Evaporation is a function of the demand for water and the supply
of water. It is driven by energy availability, particularly net radia-
tion. An increase in net radiation will increase the demand for
evaporation, but this effect will be complicated by changes in the
humidity of the air—affecting the ability of the air to accept more
water—and by changes in the rate of movement of air across the
evaporating surface. In addition, the humidity of air masses is
strongly linked to evaporation over land and water bodies, includ-
ing the oceans. With credible assumptions about increases in radi-
ation and reductions in humidity, a rise of about 2°C could cause
an increase in potential evaporation of up to 40% in a humid tem-
perate region (Arnell and Reynard, 1993), but less in a drier envi-
ronment where changes in humidity are not very important.
Higher temperatures will mean that the atmosphere can hold more
water—thus enhancing the effects of increased net radiation on
evapotranspiration in regions where air humidity currently impos-
es a constraint on the rate of evaporation (as in humid areas).

"Not much is known about evaporation in high mountain areas.
Although evaporation seems to be of secondary importance in
the water balances for these areas, it may play a considerable
role in controlling daily variations in melt rates (Lang, 1981).
With increasing altitude, vegetation activity decreases, soil
(with its capacity to store water) decreases, and the duration of
snow cover increases—together contributing to the general
decrease of evaporation with altitude. In a warmer climate,
evaporation potential is generally expected to increase, which
also is expected for high mountainous terrain.

"Mountain orography exerts a great influence on the atmospheric
circulation at all spatial scales, which affects the horizontal and
vertical distribution of precipitation. This is a point of utmost
importance. If the directions of atmospheric moisture advection
change (as a consequence of a change in the general route and
activity of cyclones), the spatial distribution of precipitation in
mountain regions could be strongly modified, compared with the
general and large-scale results of present GCM simulations.
High mountain areas exposed to strong windward and leeward
effects will be affected significantly by such changes.

"All climate models show increased soil moisture in high north-

models produce a drier surface in summer in northern mid-
latitudes and a reduction in summer precipitation over southern
Europe. Reductions over North America are less consistent, and
there is greater variation between models over northern Europe
and northern Asia. When aerosols are included, the patterns of
soil-moisture change in the northern winter are similar but
weaker, and summer drying over North America and southern
Europe is reduced (see Chapter 6, Climate Models—Projections
of Future Climate, of the Working Group I volume).

storage, runoff processes, and groundwater recharge. Land use,
river flow, and groundwater resources are affected. Improved
modeling of the hydrological cycle and of these land-surface

"Mountainous regions are particularly important in a hydrolog-
ical context. They are source areas of a significant part of the
water resources for many continental areas outside the tropics
because of orographically induced high precipitation. Water
stored as snow during the winter becomes runoff in the spring.
Higher global temperatures in winter would result in more pre-
cipitation falling as rain rather than as snow, reducing snow-
cover duration and causing the ascent of the snow line. These
changes would lead to increased winter runoff and decreased
spring and summer runoff, resulting in seasonal changes and
possible disruptions in supply in regions without reservoir-
based water management.

"The melting of snow and glaciers is sensitive to changes in air
temperature during the melt season, although temperature is
only a rough index of melt energy fluxes—which consist of net
radiation, sensible heat, and latent heat. Brun et al. (1992) used
a physically based snow model to investigate the sensitivity of
snow cover in the French Alps to increased incoming energy.
They found that at an elevation of 1,500 m above sea level,
snow cover can be considered “sensitive” during about half of
the days of its existence. This means that even a slight increase
in air temperature throughout the winter or a few individual
warm spells have important consequences in reducing the
snow cover. At 3,000 m above sea level, there is about a 6-
month period during which the sensitivity to increased energy
input is very weak; the sensitive days constitute about 30% of
the total snow-covered period, which essentially represents the
melting period. It also was shown that the entire area of the
French Alps can be considered to react homogeneously to
increases in incoming energy at elevations above 2,400 m
above sea level, but that below this elevation the southern part
of the Alps reacts more sensitively. This effect is related to lat-
itude effects of air temperature and solar radiation.

"The evaporative loss of water from vegetation, or transpiration,
is influenced by vegetative properties such as albedo, surface
roughness, root depth, and stomatal characteristics—and all of
these may change with climate. The timing of plant growth and
the species of vegetation in a catchment also might change.
Plant water use also is related to atmospheric CO, concentra-
tions, There are two main effects. First, there is experimental
evidence that some groups of plants use water more efficiently
when CO, concentrations are higher, leading to reduced tran-
spiration (Dooge, 1992; Drake, 1992). Kimball et al. (1993)
found that spring wheat grown at a CO, concentration of
550 ppm had an evaporation rate 11% lower than wheat grown
at 370 ppm. The modeling studies of Kuchment and Startseva
(1991) show that CO, enrichment can lead to a decrease in
evapotranspiration despite climate warming and that evapotran-
spiration responses to changes in climate variables and plant
factors can differ greatly from those that consider temperature
changes alone. Second, many plants grow more when CO, con-
centrations are higher, and the increased leaf area may compen-
sate for the increased leaf water-use efficiency. These experi-
mental effects may not be reproduced in the field—where plant
growth is subject to limitations in nutrients and moisture, as
well as competitive interactions—and there is some evidence
that plants acclimatize to increased CO, concentrations

be large enough to allow adjustments to water-resources plan-

and the amount of water available for recharge during the sea-
son. In northern Europe, it is uncertain whether increased win-
ter rainfall (as simulated by most GCMs) would make up for a
shorter recharge season caused by increased temperatures and
evaporation in spring and autumn. Jn semi-arid and arid areas,
where groundwater recharge occurs after flood events, a change
in the frequency of rainfall occurrence and the magnitude of
those events will alter the number of recharge events.

"The case studies in this chapter provide a clear indication that
dry areas are more sensitive than wet areas to climate variations.
Low-flow and dry climates will be more affected than high-
flow and humid regions. Warming of the atmosphere alone will
decrease streamflow far less than warming accompanied by
changes in precipitation. In the case studies presented in this
chapter, some areas show increasing annual and monthly flow
due to increased precipitation, while other regions show
decreased flow due to increased evaporation or decreased pre-
cipitation or both. High-latitude regions belong to the former
category, lower latitudes more to the latter. Depending on spe-
cific scenarios, model simulations may produce an increase or a
decrease in annual river flow for the same region, as well as
changes in the variability of river flow through the year.

"Regional changes in streamflow are illustrated by a study
examining the impact of global warming on the flow of 33 of
the world’s major rivers. Miller and Russell (1992) found that

an average of 25% in response to increased precipitation. The
largest decreases occurred at low latitudes, with a maximum of
-43% for the Indus, -31% for the Niger, and -11% for the Nile
due to the combined effects of increased evapotranspiration
and decreased precipitation. This study used the NASA/GISS
GCM and a 3-year model simulation. It found that the com-
puted runoff for a doubled CO, climate depends on the model’s
treatment of precipitation, evaporation, and soil moisture stor-
age (Miller and Russell, 1992), The authors also discuss the
great discrepancies between observed and simulated river flow
in some cases, due to oversimplified and unrealistic represen-
tations of the hydrological cycle in current GCM models.

"Changes in the magnitudes of snowmelt and rain-on-snow
floods will deserve particular attention in some regions. The
magnitudes of snowmelt floods are determined by the volume
of snow stored, the rate at which the snow melts, and the
amount of rain that falls during the melt period. Many studies
have simulated a reduction in snow cover after global warm-
ing, but higher precipitation totals still may lead to a greater
volume of snow being stored on the catchment. Floods caused
by snowmelt may therefore either increase or decrease. A
reduction in snow cover also may mean that more rain-gener-
ated floods occur during winter, leading to a shift in the sea-
sonal distribution of floods.

as are natural lakes to some degree. Climate-change impacts on
the hydrology of upstream river basins will affect regulated
lakes mostly in seasonal and annual regimes and average
turnover. Flow and temperature changes also may change the
internal stratification of lakes, with consequences to aquatic
ecosystems. An increase-in air temperature and/or windspeed

"Global warming can be expected to produce changes in the
frequency of intense rainfall in a catchment for two reasons:
(1) There may be a change in the paths and intensities of
depressions and storms, and (2) there probably will be an
increase in convective activity (Gordon et al., 1992; Whetton

to increase the intensity of tropical cyclones and to expand the
area over which they may develop. The IPCC Working Group
I Second Assessment concludes from the analysis of several
climate-model experiments that rainfall intensity is likely to
increase with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and
that there may be an increasing concentration of rainfall on
fewer rain days.

"Conceptual snow and runoff models have been used to simulate
discharge from mountain regions under changed climate condi-
tions (e.g., Kuchment et al., 1987, 1990; Lettenmaier and Gan,
1990; Bultot er al., 1992, 1994; Rango, 1992; Braun et al., 1994).
The necessary model parameter values have been evaluated
under present-day conditions, usually with the assumption that
these parameter values do not change under changed climatic
conditions. Most studies show a shift of snowmelt runoff to early
spring months at the expense of summer months. In heavily
glaciated basins, there is a negative feedback between snow cover
and discharge: The smaller the seasonal snow cover, the larger the
runoff from glaciers due to increased icemelt caused by reduced
albedo as soon as the snow cover disappears (see Roethlisberger
and Lang, 1987; Chen and Ohmura, 1990). This aspect generally
has not been dealt with in sensitivity studies. Another aspect is the
increased loss of glacial areas with increasing summer tempera-
tures. The additional contribution of meltwater to streamflow
experienced through decades of strong glacial shrinkage would
gradually turn into decreasing streamflow rates. All scenario
studies presently available are limited in predictive value because
they have distributed the positive temperature change more or
less evenly over the year, without taking account of the impor-
tance of short-time scale (weather) processes. Detailed discus-
sions of the limitations of GCMs to provide scenarios in alpine
regions, and the impact of climate change on these regions, are

low elevations, where the snow cover is built up and disappears

"There is evidence from climate models and hydrological
impact studies that flood frequencies are likely to increase with
global warming. The amount of increase is very uncertain and,
for a given change in climate, will vary considerably between
catchments. In some catchments, floods may become less fre-
quent. There are four main reasons for the large uncertainty:
(1) It is very difficult to define credible scenarios, at the catch-
ment scale, for changes in flood-producing precipitation; (2) it
is often difficult to model the transformation from rainfall (or
snowmelt) to flood in a catchment; (3) available climatic and
hydrological records often provide limited information about
flood events; and (4) at present, in many cases, it is difficult to
differentiate the effects of climatic change from those associat-

"The frequency and severity of droughts has received little

catchment vegetal cover and atmospheric moisture has been
neglected (Savenije and Hall, 1994). Many studies focus on
simple descriptive statistics of daily, monthly, seasonal, or
annual soil moisture and flow over the simulation period,
including minimum annual discharge (Mimikou and

current GCM simulates ENSO effects. The observed interan-
nual variability of rainfall in north and east Australia is strong-
ly influenced by ENSO. Several researchers have investigated
the impact of climate change on reservoir reliability using sto-

long-term sequences of synthetic weather data (e.g., Nathan et

"Stream ecology has acknowledged the close link between ter-
restrial catchments and aquatic systems since Hynes (1963,
1975). Progressive longitudinal changes in channel morpholo-
gy and in dominant sources of water and organic matter,
together with downgradient flow, produce predictable ecologi-
cal patterns along the continuum from small streams to large
rivers (Vannote et a/., 1980; Minshall et a/., 1983). Nutrient
and organic-matter input to streams is closely related to terres-
trial and wetland processes (Bormann et al., 1969; Likens,
1984; McDowell and Likens, 1988; Wetzel, 1990) and to the
flow path of water controlling its dissolved load. The chemistry
of water entering streams in Alaska, for example, is dependent
not only on the types of terrestrial vegetation through which
water flows but also their sequential order (Giblin er al., 1991).
Physical and chemical properties of lakes are linked strongly to
terrestrial processes via effects on stream discharge and chem-
istry. Recent studies of lake districts show the importance of
landscape influences on internal lake properties (Swanson et
al., 1988). In headwater lake districts, biotic diversity and eco-
logical functioning depend upon landscape position; higher
drainages receive proportionately more input from direct pre-
cipitation and differ markedly from those lower in the jand-
scape that receive larger inputs of water and materials from ter-
restrial sources (Kratz et al., 1991, 1996).

"Physical and biological characteristics of catchments—such as
geology, soils and microbes, vegetation, and dominant flow
paths of water—control the chemistry of surface water and
groundwater. If the water table is close to the surface, flow is
routed primarily through organically rich and biologically
active upper soil horizons; concentrations of most major ions
are lower and concentrations of dissolved organic material
higher than if water tables are deep and water moves through
lower mineral soil horizons and bedrock before entering lakes
or streams. Vegetation and soils, in conjunction with hydrolog-
ic flow paths, control the effects of nutrient inputs from atmos-
pheric deposition or fertilizer applications. In agricultural
catchments, the effects of fertilizer application on surface-
water nutrient concentrations are reduced substantially if water
moves through riparian areas where natural vegetation has
been preserved (Peterjohn and Correll, 1984). Climate
changes that alter hydrologic flow paths or vegetation and soil
characteristics will result in changes in groundwater and sur-
face-water chemistry. For streams, these chemical shifts may
be episodic or seasonal; for lakes with long residence times, the
shifts may be in average chemical characteristics.

Increases of 1-2°C in air temperatures could substantially increase the stability of stratification in permanently stratified

deep water in warm seasons maintains a density difference that prevents full circulation. Lake Tanganyika’s deep water
has been characterized as a “relict” hypolimnion that formed under a cooler climate within the past 1,000 years (Hecky
et al., 1994). Since then, warming has created a barrier to vertical circulation. Additional warming could strengthen this
barrier and reduce the mixing of deep, nutrient-rich hypolimnetic water and nutrient-depleted surface layers; that mixing
sustains one of the most productive freshwater fisheries in the world (Hecky et al., 1981).

the UK (Webb, 1992) and the north-central United States (Stefan

increases of 1.5° to 4.5°C, using a heat-balance model, produce

waters) temperatures by 1-7°C, and hypolimnetic (deep cooler
waters) temperatures change by -6 to +8°C depending on the
size and morphology of the lake (Stefan er al., 1993; DeStasio et

1 mg/L in upper layers and 1-2 mg/L in lower layers can be
expected, as can an increase in the area of the lake that is anox-
ic. This is because at warmer lake temperatures, bacterial activ-
ity increases in deep waters and surficial sediment, not from a
relocation of the thermocline and smaller hypolimnetic volume.
Smaller lakes (Figure 10-6) have similar responses to simula-
tions with a 2 x CO, climate (Stefan et al., 1993; Stefan and
Fang, 1994). In surface waters, dissolved oxygen remains above
7 mg/L and declines by not more than 2 mg/L. In deep hypolim-
netic waters, simulated concentrations are as much as 8 mg/L
lower in midsummer and never less than 2 mg/L lower.
Depletion would occur up to 2 months longer than under base-
line conditions owing to longer periods of stratification.
Declines in dissolved oxygen are projected to occur in produc-
tive (eutrophic) and nonproductive (oligotrophic) lakes but to be
more rapid and of longer duration in productive lakes. Simulated
declines in dissolved oxygen are more apparent in spring and fall
because stratification would be extended into these seasons.
Changes in water levels would interact with the mixing proper-

increased river flows would influence channel erosion, with
erosion potential increasing for higher flows. Not all sediment
generated on hillslopes reaches the river channel, but increased
hillslope and channel erosion should increase sediment loads.

scenarios. Analyses of climatic warming effects from earlier sce-
narios may overestimate effects, compared with new analyses
with more recent scenarios. Previous IPCC 2 x CO, scenarios
suggested globally averaged mean annual temperature increases
of 1.5° to 4.5°C (IPCC, 1992)—about twice the values from cur-
rent IPCC scenarios with ramped models and the effect of
atmospheric aerosols. Nonetheless, the climate warming effects
described in this section are reasonable in direction, if not in
magnitude. Current scenarios also suggest that warming will be
greater in fall/winter and at night during summer than at other
times. Regional differences in future climatic change will be
important, and GCM-based global scenarios still do not provide
adequate regional scenarios. Regional warming may be consid-

"Historical analogs provide useful information about possible
changes in sediment loads. Sediment loads on the River
Garonne (France) during a wet period in the 1840s were four
to five times higher than in drier periods (Probst, 1989). River
sediment loads in northern regions will be affected not only by
flow regime changes but also by temperature rise. If warming
raises temperatures above freezing for longer periods, snow
and icemelt and permafrost degradation would increase, releas-
ing more sediment into rivers (Woo and McCaan, 1994).
Changes in flow regime and sediment loads would change
river channel stability; specifics depend not only on changes in
inputs but also on the channel’s proximity to a change in
threshold. A channel at the boundary between braided and
meandering would be more sensitive to change than one with a
clearly defined, meandering channel. An upland channel might
be most sensitive to changes in the supply of sediments from
adjacent hillslopes, whereas a lowland channel would be more
sensitive to changes in sediment loads from upstream.

"Direct effects of climatic warming on the productivity, life his-
tory, and reproduction of organisms in streams and lakes will
result primarily from increases in average water temperatures
and growing season, increases in winter water temperatures
and a shorter winter period of cold water or freezing, and
increases in maximum summer water temperatures. Indirect
effects of warming on productivity and life history include
changes in hydrology, especially of extreme events (Section
10.6.2), and in vertical mixing (Section 10.5.4). In streams,
ecological effects should be strongest in humid regions where
streamflows are less variable and biological interactions con-
trol organism abundance (Poff and Ward, 1990). Warming
effects should be strong in small, mid-latitude streams where
large groundwater discharges currently maintain relatively low
maximum water temperatures in summer, as well as in mid-lat-
itude and high latitude streams that experience large increases
in annual degree days. Direct thermal effects on lake organisms
should be greatest at higher latitudes where the largest changes
in temperature are expected.

would be least in the tropics, moderate at mid-latitudes, and

warming because respiration increases more rapidly with tem-
perature than photosynthesis does, Even though the photosyn-
thetic rates of many algae increase with temperature—at least
up to about 25° to 30°C (Davison, 1991)—ecosystem primary
production may increase little because nutrient concentrations
and light availability often limit algal production, and these
factors also change with climate change. Respiration rates
increase with temperature at both the organism and ecosystem
levels. At average levels of light and biomass, ecosystem P:R
ratio in Arizona declines from 3.0 at 19°C to 1.6 at 30°C
(Busch and Fisher, 1981). In Ontario, Canada, the P:R ratio of
stream communities on stone surfaces declines from 4 at 4°C
to 0.5 at 28°C (Rempel and Carter, 1986). A drop in P:R ratio
tends to reduce the average mass of benthic organic matter
and/or the export of organic matter downstream (Carpenter et
al., 1992). Higher rates of microbial respiration with higher
temperatures suggest that food resources for invertebrates
feeding on seasonally available detritus from terrestrial vege-
tation might increase in the short term following its input to
streams. However, higher microbial respiration rates will
increase organic-matter decomposition rates and may shorten
the period over which detritus is available to invertebrates

for populations at the high- or low-latitudinal edges of their
ranges. Winter survival would be enhanced for young-of-year
white perch (Morone americana) at the northern edge of their

"Reduced streamflows produced by lower precipitation and/or
increased evapotranspiration would increase the probability of
intermittent flow in smaller streams. Drying of streambeds for
extended periods reduces ecosystem productivity because the
aquatic habitat is restricted, water quality is reduced (e.g.,
expanded hypoxia), and intense competition and predation
reduce total biomass (Fisher and Grimm, 1991; Stanley and

western United States have invertebrate communities dominated
by organisms with resistant life stages and short life cycles
(Boulton and Lake, 1992; Gray, 1981). Recovery of benthic
invertebrates with the resumption of flow can be slow. More than
4 months were required for recovery of macroinvertebrate bio-

Colorado River caused by dam operations upstream (Blinn et al.,

"Ice cover in lakes and streams is expected to decrease with cli-
matic warming (see Chapter 7). Reduced durations of ice cover
are expected under scenarios with 2 x CO, climates; at the low-
est latitudes where ice now occurs seasonally, ice is not expect-
ed to form at all in many winters (DeStasio et al., 1996).
Observed ice durations decreased markedly during a 20-year
period of warming in central North America (Schindler et al.,
1990). In the Antarctic Dry Valley, ice cover has thinned for
some of these permanently ice-covered lakes. Lake Hoare
thinned by 20 cm/yr over a 10-year period beginning in 1977;
ice cover is now 3.5 m thick (Wharton et al., 1992). Because
light attenuation by the ice is a major limiting factor, these cli-
mate-related changes are expected to cause shifts in the biota of
lakes with substantial periods of ice cover (Doran et al., 1994).

In the Laurentian Great Lakes, loss of winter ice cover results in
year-class failure of lake whitefish, because the eggs incubate
over the winter and increased turbulence and winter mixing
reduce their survival (Brown and Taylor, 1993). On Grand
Traverse Bay, Lake Michigan, the number of winters without ice
cover has increased in recent years (Assel and Robertson, 1995).
If this trend continues—as is expected with greenhouse warm-
ing-—the lake whitefish are expected to decline in abundance.

In shallow lakes and the backwaters of large rivers, a decrease
in ice-cover duration and especially the absence of ice cover
would reduce the winter anoxia common at mid- to high lati-
tudes, This could be countered somewhat by lower water lev-
els, which reduce water volumes under the ice and increase the
likelihood of winter kill. Winter kill of fish, owing to loss of
oxygen under the ice, is a common occurrence in North
America and northern Europe; this severe event greatly influ-
ences the fish assemblage structure (Tonn, 1990): Small, shal-

runoff response to precipitation is nonlinear (Dahm and Molles, 1992). Longer periods of drought and more-intense
storms may produce severe streambank and channel erosion because aridland riparian vegetation is sensitive to the avail-
ability of water, and unvegetated soils are highly erodible (Grimm and Fisher, 1992).

"Changes in long-term processes also are important. Catchment-derived fluxes of nitrogen to desert streams are higher in
floods that occur after several years of low precipitation (Grimm, 1992), presumably owing to accumulation of nitrate in
soils during droughts. Century-scale arroyo-cutting episodes alter drainage patterns, drain wetlands, and shape stream chan-

"The contribution of each controlling process to the system’s state depends on the temporal pattern of flooding rather than

tions characterize a substantial proportion of the year (Fisher and Grimm, 1991). In Sycamore Creek, annual runoff in
1970 was equivalent to 1988 but occurred as two flash floods compared to eight in 1988. Consequently, drought dynam-

residential and other shoreline developments. An extensive
study concludes that the cost of controlling water level on all
five Laurentian Great Lakes would be prohibitively expensive.
Costs associated with adaptation to 2 x CO, water-level scenar-
ios also are high. Changnon et al. (1989) estimate that increased
dredging of harbors for a rather small length of Lake Michigan
shoreline, including Chicago, would cost $138 to $312 million
if water levels dropped by 1.25 to 2.5 m. Measures such as low-
ering docks, extending water supply sources and stormwater
outfalls added another $132 to $228 million.

"Changes in lake water levels (Section 10.5.2; Figure 10-4)
have large effects on nearshore biotic assemblages. In Lake
Titicaca, South America, submerged macrophytes experience
significant mortality when water levels change more rapidly
than they can adapt (see Dejoux and Iltis, 1992). In Lake
Kinneret in the Middle East, changes in inshore ecosystems
occur with rapid water-level fluctuations, even though upper
and lower water levels are regulated; the lake is a major reser-
voir of Israel’s freshwater supply. A 4-m water-level decline in
Kinneret reduces the stony belt around the lake by 30-94%
(Gafny et al., 1992), and the littoral slope changes from steep
to slight (Gasith and Gafny, 1990). During low lake levels,
wave action affects more areas of soft sediment than at high
lake levels, resulting in short-term effects on water quality
(Gafny and Gasith, 1989, 1993). Emergent vegetation develops
in areas with gentle slope (Gasith and Gafny, 1990). The com-
munity of fish breeding in the littoral zone switches from dom-
inance by fish that spawn on stones to those that spawn on sand
(Gafny et al., 1992). This may affect year-class strength of the
primary planktivorous fish and eventually the entire food web.
A warmer and drier climate in the Middle East would exacer-
bate such changes in inshore aquatic communities.

"At the higher latitude boundaries of species’ distributions,
organisms should be able to migrate poleward with climate
warming, provided the new habitats are accessible through
connecting waters. In North America, a 4°C increase in air
temperatures is sufficient to move the simulated ranges of
smallmouth bass and yellow perch northward across Canada
by about 5° latitude, or about 500 km (Shuter and Post, 1990).
These simulations include the entire life cycles and seasonali-

changes such as reduced stream flow (Eaton and Scheller,

increase in streams and shallow, unstratified lakes and ponds
and cooler-water refuges are not available. In the southern
Great Plains of the United States, summer water temperatures
of 38-40°C already approach the lethal limits (less than 40°C)
for many native stream fish, most of which are minnows
(Matthews and Zimmerman, 1990). Fish aggregate in slightly
cooler shaded waters of pools and tributary streams (32-35°C);
this crowding induces various stresses, including overexploita-
tion of prey resources. These wide, slow-moving streams have
no high-altitude refuges; they flow to the south or east, making
escape poleward unlikely. If a 3-4°C warming occurs, many
endemic species could become extinct.

"Heterogeneous thermal habitats can provide thermal refuges.
In laboratory gradients, most freshwater fish spend two-thirds
of their time within a 4°C range and all of their time within a
10°C range around their preferred optima (Magnuson et al.,
1979; Magnuson and DeStasio, 1996). This ability allows them
to seek out survivable or optimum temperatures in lakes and
streams that are thermally heterogeneous. In summer, stream
fish can move to higher elevations (Rahel et al., 1996), to
teaches closer to groundwater sources (Meisner, 1990), or to
shaded cooler areas (Matthews and Zimmerman, 1990); in
thermally stratified lakes, fish can move downward to deeper,
cooler waters (Magnuson and DeStasio, 1996).

"In deep, thermally stratified temperate lakes, thermal habitat
generally increases with 2 x CO, scenarios of global warming,
not only for warm- and cool-water fish, but also for cold-water
fish (Magnuson et al., 1990; DeStasio et al., 1996; Magnuson
and DeStasio, 1996) (Figure 10-9). Similar increases are pro-
jected in smaller and larger lakes in Wisconsin for warm- and
cool-water fish, but results were equivocal among GCM sce-
narios for cold-water fish in the smaller lakes. Increases
occurred because the length of the growing season increased
and because fish could move to deeper, cooler waters when
surface waters exceeded preferred temperatures. Deep-water
thermal refuges for cold-water fish are maintained in model
projections over large latitudinal ranges (McLain et al., 1994),
assuming that deep-water oxygen is sufficient.

Rates of species invasion would increase poleward as condi-
tions warm (Mandrak, 1989). These invasions can hasten
changes associated with climate warming by increasing the
rate of decline of existing species (Lodge, 1993) and add to the
uncertainty (Magnuson, 1976) of predicting the effects of cli-

"Rates of climate warming are likely to exceed rates of genetic
adaptation for some local populations of aquatic invertebrates,
as well as the rate of natural dispersal of warm-tolerant popu-
lations that might be expected to replace them (see Box 10-4). .
Similar projections can be made for fish. Genetic variation in
critical and chronic thermal maxima has occurred in separated
populations of largemouth bass (Fields et al., 1987), but ther-
mal preference has not changed among populations
(Koppelman et ail., 1988). Crawshaw and O’Connor (1996)

fish and mammal thermoregulatory anatomy and processes—
that genetic shifts in thermal preferences of fish might be fast
under certain conditions.

"Some aquatic invertebrates show high genotypic vari-
ability with little differentiation among sites; others
vary greatly among sites but exhibit little genetic vari-
ability within a site. Hogg et al. (1995) tested the
hypothesis that populations with little genetic variabili-
ty would fare less well in a changing environment than
those with more genetic variability. The amphipod
Hyalella azteca disperses poorly but has high genetic
variation; a stonefly, Nemoura trispinosa, has flying
adults but low genetic variation. On one side of a split
southern Ontario stream, temperature was raised year-
round by 2.0-3.5°C for 3 years. Total invertebrate
fauna was reduced by this treatment, but neither 1.
azteca nor N. trispinosa declined, although they did
show life-history changes. Under warm conditions, the
amphipod bred two months earlier and the stonefly
emerged two weeks earlier at slightly smaller sizes.
The authors postulate that endemic populations with
poor dispersal abilities would suffer the long-term con-
sequences of environmental warming.

"The lack of suitable north-south migration routes (drainages)
may limit dispersal, as well as replacement of cold-water fauna
with warmer-water fauna. If dispersal rates of arriving warm-
water species are low in freshwaters with declining cold-water
taxa, the biomass and productivity of the community would be
reduced with climate warming, at least initially, because range
shifts may lag behind changes in thermal regimes (for stream
invertebrates, see Sweeney et al., 1992). This problem would
be most restrictive for taxa that are less vagil (e.g., aquatic
insects with fragile or short-lived adult stages) and for isolated
freshwater ecosystems such as closed-basin lakes and streams.
Isolation would be less severe for organisms that can be carried
by the wind, such as very small organisms (e.g., algae and
microbes) and those with small resting stages (e.g., cladocer-
ans and rotifers), or for organisms with flying adults such as
many aquatic insects. Fish dispersal (Magnuson ef al., 1989b;
Tonn et al., 1990) would be more restricted to water courses,
transport by humans, or even rare extreme events (Dennis and
Wolff, 1992) such as tornadoes.

"Lake sediments accumulate over time and can contain an inter-
pretable record of the history of the lake’s biota from the
remains of diatoms, chrysophytes, zooplankton and other
aquatic invertebrates, and, rarely, even fish. A variety of organ-
isms have been examined for use in inferring changes in cli-
mate; they explicitly indicate changes in lake biota in response
to climate change. Diatoms appear to be the most sensitive
indicators of past lake conditions; they are being used to exam-
ine the history of lakes in closed basins (Juggins et al., 1994)
and water levels (Gont et al., 1988). They have been used to
examine changes in the duration of ice cover (Smol, 1988). As
a consequence of habitat specificity related to temperature
(Douglas and Smol, 1995), they may be sensitive indicators of
increases in temperature, especially in the high Arctic. Diatom
communities respond to changes in salinity (Fritz et al., 1993)
that result from changes in precipitation or runoff. Diatoms
respond to a number of environmental conditions, and they are
sensitive to light and nutrient availability (Kilham er al., 1996).

"Climate changes that produce higher water temperatures and
lower flows and water levels will increase the negative effects
of wastewater and thermal effluents on freshwater ecosystems.
Because warmer temperatures make lakes and streams more
productive—in a sense, more eutrophic in their behavior—it
may be necessary to reduce alternate causes related to unwant-
ed or nuisance production. Among the options would be to fur-
ther decrease the loading of nutrients such as phosphorus and
nitrogen from sewage treatment plants or to reduce leakage
from diffuse agricultural and urban sources. Human adapta-
tions that reduce these effluents—such as recycling or land
application of wastewater effluents where appropriate—and
increased use of recirculating cooling systems with cooling
towers could help. Because the accumulation of many toxic
substances in the freshwater food web is greater at higher tem-
peratures, it also may be necessary to further reduce the release
of these contaminants or further constrain the ingestion of con-
taminated fish by humans.

about the direction as well as the magnitude of some climate
impacts when uncertainties about climate change at the region-
al level are taken into account.

"Although the energy, industry, and transportation sectors are of
great economic importance, the climate sensitivity of most
activities is low relative to that of agriculture and natural
ecosystems, while the capacity for autonomous adaptation is
high, as long as climate change takes place gradually. The life-
times of most assets are short compared to projected time
scales for climate change. Consumer goods, motor vehicles,
and heating and cooling systems will be replaced several times
over the next half century. Even medium-life assets such as
industrial plants, oil and gas pipelines, and conventional power
stations are likely to be completely replaced, though there will
be less opportunity for adaptation. Additional difficulties and
costs could arise with long-lived assets, including some renew-
able energy projects and residential buildings.

"Climate change will have direct impacts on economic activity
in the industry, energy, and transportation sectors; impacts on
markets for goods and services; and impacts on the natural
resources on which economic activity depends. Activities
directly sensitive to climate include construction, transporta-
tion, offshore oil and gas production, manufacturing dependent
on water, tourism and recreation, and industry that is located in
coastal zones and permafrost regions. Activities with markets
sensitive to climate include electricity and fossil fuel production
for space heating and air conditioning, construction activity
associated with coastal defenses, and transportation. Activities
dependent on climate-sensitive resources include agroindustries
(food/drink, forestry-related activity, and textiles), biomass pro-
duction, and other renewable energy production.

"high population densities, climate change could have a
significant effect on the production of biomass (i.e.,
living matter that can be burned to meet energy needs).
There is a high level of confidence that hydroelectric
production will be influenced by changes in precipita-
tion and water availability. There is low confidence
concerning whether these changes will be beneficial
or otherwise because much depends on the relation-
ship between seasonal patterns of precipitation and
electricity demand in specific regions.

It is certain that higher temperatures resulting from
climate change will reduce energy needs for space
heating and increase those for air conditioning. There
is a low level of confidence concerning the balance
between these changes. For example, one study of the
United States concluded that energy needs could fall
by 11% with a 1°C rise in temperature. Another con-
cluded that electricity demand would increase by
4-6% with a rise of 3.7°C.

There is a high level of confidence that sea-level rise
will increase the cost of protecting transportation infra-
structure and industrial plants located in coastal regions.
Coastal protection will provide a market opportunity for
the construction industry.

There is a high level of confidence that climate
change will increase the vulnerability of infrastruc-
tures located in permafrost regions.

There is a high level of confidence that skiing seasons
will shorten with consequent impacts on some local
economies. There is also a high level of confidence that
sea-level rise will affect tourism in beach resort areas.

"Further research would be assisted by the generation of climate
scenarios covering a fuller range of variables at the regional
level. There is a need to broaden the scope of work to cover a
wider range of activities (for example, agroindustry) and a
wider range of countries, especially developing countries.
Studies that begin to draw out the interdependence of econom-
ic activities in relation to climate would be particularly helpful.

"Research on climate impacts has focused largely on developed
rather than developing countries, even though the latter have
less diversified economies that may be more vulnerable to cli-
mate change. Within the developed countries, work has
focused on a small number of impacts, notably the possible
effects of climate change on energy demand. This may reflect
the availability of research tools as much as priority-setting.

Autonomous adaptation cannot be relied upon, and govern-

are dependent on single crops or on fishing and therefore are
economically vulnerable to climate change through impacts on
agroindustry. Diversifying economic activity could be an
important precautionary response that would facilitate success-

from the impact of past economic activity, the first three groups
will be affected by climate change independently of current
and future mitigation actions. This chapter is aimed at the
needs of these groups. The needs of policymakers who are
responsible for balancing mitigation and adaptation strategies
are addressed, especially in Chapter 6, The Social Costs of

"More difficulties could arise with long-lived assets such as cer-
tain residential buildings and infrastructure. Some assets (for
example, a dam or a tidal barrage) have a design life of more
than a century. Long-lived assets may need to function in a cli-
mate for which they were not designed. Infrastructure may be
modified during its lifetime, however. For example, roads, port
facilities, or coastal protection construction may be rebuilt peri-
odically while retaining the same location and basic function.
Rebuilding or upgrading offers substantial opportunities to
adapt to changing climate conditions. Even medium-life assets
such as power stations may be modified substantially during
their lifetime—for example, by changing the fuel inputs,
improving efficiency, or adding pollution control equipment.

the lifetimes of assets in the energy, industry, and transporta-
tion sectors are short compared to the timescales for change
projected using climate models. Table 11-1, based on Skea
(1995), shows that, over the 60-70 years during which CO,
concentrations in the atmosphere might double, many short-
lived assets such as consumer goods, motor vehicles, and
space heating/cooling systems will be replaced several times,
offering considerable opportunities for adaptation. Even medi-
um-life assets such as industrial plants, oil and gas pipelines,

"This chapter reviews literature addressing the potential impacts
of climate change on the energy, industry, and transportation
sectors and the associated capacity for adaptation. The chapter
begins by considering broad issues relating to impacts and
adaptation in the three sectors. It moves on to a more precise
definition of the sectors, identifying their economic importance
and the more important climate sensitivities. There follows a
general overview of the different types of studies that have
been conducted and the range of methodologies that have been
used. The largest part of the chapter is devoted to a detailed
review of this literature. For this purpose, activity is classified
according to three types of climate sensitivity: activities with
markets that are sensitive to climate, activities and processes
that may be directly affected by climate change, and activities
that are dependent on climate-sensitive resources.

"A fully consistent treatment of the industry, energy, and trans-

assessment of impacts/adaptation and mitigation. Such
approaches are now beginning to be developed (for example,
Dowlatabadi and Morgan, 1993; Cohan ef al., 1994), but few
studies take account of feedbacks within the energy sector. For
the most part this chapter, of necessity, ignores interactions
between impacts/adaptation and mitigation actions.

the processing of agricultural products into forms that make
them suitable for meeting final consumer demands. Food, tex-

forestry, and fishing, however, are not included. Most of the
service sector is not sensitive to climate change, and there are

"A good indicator of the capacity for climate adaptation is the
importance of the climate signal in relation to other pressures
for change in the sector concerned. How do the pressures of
climate change compare with those of changing demographics,
market conditions, technological innovation, or resource deple-
tion? Over periods of half a century or more, many sectors will
change beyond recognition, while others may disappear com-
pletely. New products, markets, and technologies will also
emerge. An industry coping with other, more significant
changes may be able to adapt easily to climate change.

"The “energy sector” is spread across a range of ISIC activities
and includes: coal, oil, and natural gas production; coke man-
ufacture, refined petroleum products, and nuclear fuel; and
electricity generation, electricity and gas transmission, and dis-
tribution. Biomass fuels and renewable energy are also cov-
ered. Transportation is a major component of the world econo-
my, accounting for 10-20% of gross domestic product (GDP)
in most countries. Transportation is growing rapidly; it now
accounts for approximately one-fifth of CO, emissions from
fossil fuel use (Lashof and Tirpak, 1990).

gies is not the focus of this chapter, mitigation is a key concern
in the energy sector. Energy plays a pivotal role in the assess-
ment of climate change since fossil fuel combustion is one of
the most important sources of greenhouse gas emissions. The
energy sector is therefore likely to be one of the main targets
for policies and measures aimed at mitigating climate change.
Climate change, however, will also modify patterns of energy
demand and industrial activity and, hence, greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions. As a result, the amount of mitigation
action required to reach any given target for either emissions

"The sensitivity of industry and energy to climate change is wide-
ly believed to be low in relation to that of natural ecosystems and
agriculture, while adaptability is high (National Academy of
Sciences, 1992; Nordhaus, 1993), Different branches of industry,
however, vary considerably in their climate sensitivity. Broadly
speaking, sectors that are high up the manufacturing chain or are
directly dependent on primary resources (agroindustries, renew-
able energy) display greater sensitivity than do sectors further
down the manufacturing chain—for example, engineering. The
interactions and interdependence of various activities and sys-

"Different regions of the world vary greatly in their capacity to
adapt. More vulnerable regions include those with less access
to new technology, those that rely heavily on single sources of
energy, and those dependent on single crops or on fishing. It
has been argued (National Academy of Sciences, 1992) that
poverty makes people more vulnerable to change and reduces
their flexibility to respond. Both individuals and institutions in
developing countries are likely to have less capacity to adapt to
a changed climate. If climate change takes place gradually and
if the potential impacts of climate change are allowed for in the
development process, then the prospects for successful adapta-
tion will be enhanced. Diversifying economic activity could be
an important precautionary response that would facilitate suc-
cessful adaptation to climate change.

"The magnitude of climate impacts is a func-
tion of both the severity of the impact and
the importance of the affected sector
(National Academy of Sciences, 1992).
Table 11-2 shows both the contribution of
industry to total economic output in differ-
ent regions of the world and the contribu-
tion of different sectors to industrial output
(UNIDO, 1993). Broadly speaking, devel-
oping countries are less reliant on industry
than are developed countries, but climate-
sensitive industrial sectors such as energy
and food make a relatively greater contri-
bution to economic output in developing
countries. The greater importance is reflect-
ed even more strongly in terms of employ-
ment (UNIDO, 1993). The number of peo-
ple working in the food industry in devel-
oping market economies rose from approx-
imately 10.5 million in 1970 to 17 million
in 1990. Between 1977 and 1989, the rate
of growth in developing countries was
5.3% per year as opposed to 2.0% per year
in industrialized countries (Table 11-3).

"The diverse range of activities covered in
this chapter is affected by a corresponding-
ly wide range of climate variables (Table
11-4). Temperature changes over daily and
seasonal cycles are of key importance, but
other relevant variables include precipita-
tion, humidity, ground moisture, insola-
tion, wind speed, storminess, and sea-level
rise. Ideally, impacts and adaptation should
be reviewed in the context of climate sce-
narios covering a wide range of variables
at the regional level. The uncertainties in
present computer simulations of regional
climate change, however, are too large to
yield a high level of confidence. This, cou-
pled with the sparse use of climate scenario
frameworks in most impacts and adapta-
tion work in the industry, energy, and trans-
portation sectors, means that much of this
chapter must be restricted to reviewing cli-
mate sensitivities. Recent climate scenar-
ios can be used as benchmarks against
which to judge reported sensitivities or the
results of impact studies based on different
climate assumptions. Many existing
impact studies are based on assumptions
about benchmark CO, doubling that have a

"Only the most sophisticated studies use internally consistent
scenarios for socioeconomic change as weil as climate scenar-
ios. The industry and energy sectors, however, will change sig-
nificantly over the next half century. The process of economic
development will result in changes in the scale, composition,
and location of industrial activity. Technological change,
changes in resource availability, and environmental constraints
likewise will affect activity patterns. The great uncertainties
attached to future patterns of activity are reflected in the range
of socioeconomic scenarios that have been developed to
describe, for example, future energy demand and supply
(IPCC, 1992; World Energy Council, 1993a). The failure to
take account of socioeconomic change is one of the greatest
weaknesses of the impacts/adaptation literature relating to
energy, industry, and transportation.
"	Text
"The studies vary greatly in their use of climate and socioeco-
nomic scenarios. Sensitivity studies make no use of scenarios
but simply identify the effect, or the degree of autonomous
adaptation, that a given climate stimulus would induce. Some
studies have used an historic “analog” of anticipated climate
change (Rosenberg and Crosson, 1991), while others (Smith
and Tirpak, 1989) have used the results of scenarios generated
by climate models. Many studies that use consistent climate
scenarios estimate the effects of climate change on existing
technology and patterns of economic activity. Such exercises
have a heuristic value but cannot be taken as a prediction of the
actual impacts of climate change because they do not take ade-
quate account of the impacts of technological and economic
changes unrelated to climate and the possibility of autonomous
adaptation over timescales of decades.
"	Text
"Globally averaged temperatures, which would, for
example, influence energy demand, are projected to
rise by 0.15-0.25°C per decade. Many impact stud-
ies, however, typically assume a 4.5°C increase by
the middle of next century and need to be reviewed
with more modest temperature increases in mind.
Regional temperature changes may be greater or less
than the mean. :

Water availability and agroindustry could be affected
by precipitation patterns. Precipitation is likely to
increase throughout the year at high northern latitudes.
In mid-latitudes, winters could be wetter, while sum-
mers could be drier. Precipitation during the Asian
monsoon season is likely to increase.

The frequency of extreme weather events has impli-
cations for vulnerable infrastructure in the energy,
industry, and transportation sectors. There is little
agreement on how storminess might change in a
warmer world. There is growing evidence, however,
that heavy rain events will become more frequent.
Sea-level rise could affect coastally located infra-
structure. The current estimate of average global sea-
level rise is 25-70 cm for the year 2100, which is
lower than the range presented by IPCC in 1990 and
lower than the range assumed in many impact studies.
Sea-level rise at the regional level could be as much
as twice or as little as half the global average.

"Economic activity directly sensitive to climate is found in the
construction, electricity, oil, gas, transportation, and water sec-

onshore production. In addition, some industrial activity is
located in zones that are sensitive to climate change. Oil refin-
ing and some types of power generation, for example, tend to
be located in coastal zones in order to facilitate the transport of
raw materials and products. Transportation is vulnerable
through the effects of sea-level rise on coastal infrastructure
and the more direct effect of weather on operations.
Constructions in the permafrost regions are especially vulnera-

"energy, transportation, and other sectors, such as agriculture
and human settlements. These interactions may transmit cli-
mate sensitivities through the economic system and are critical
to an understanding of the broader impacts of climate change.
Table 11-5 splits economic activity into four broad sectors—
energy, agroindustry, transport, and other sectors—which are
subdivided further into narrower bands of activity. It identifies
those classes of climate sensitivity to which each sector is sub-
ject and gives a broad indication of the degree of sensitivity.
The energy sector and agro-based industries show, in a qualita-
tive sense, the greatest sensitivity. Since energy is an input to
most other industrial activity, the impacts of climate change as
reflected in energy costs will cascade through the industrial
sector. Water (Chapter 14) is another important vector for
transmitting climate sensitivity through an economy.

tricity and gas sectors, are highly conscious of the link
between energy demand and climate because peak capacity
needs are determined for extreme weather conditions. In the
UK, for example, where natural gas is the dominant heating
fuel, annual send-out can vary by as much as +10% because of
variations in annual average temperature. In the UK, the cli-
mate-related variability of gas demand since the mid-1980s
has been much larger than it was over the period 1950-85

from established statistical relationships between weather and
energy demand or from projected climate-induced changes in
physical parameters such as degree days. The merits of the
two approaches are discussed in Chapter 12. Table 11-6

"The two uses of energy most sensitive to climate change are
space heating and air conditioning in residential and com-
mercial buildings and agricultural applications such as irriga-
tion pumping and crop drying. Supply companies will adapt
by changing the amount of new investment required to meet
peak demand on electricity and gas networks and the compo-
sition of investment that would most cost-effectively meet
changed temporal patterns of demand. Many studies that
assess the impact of climate change on building energy
demand have been conducted. The majority focus specifical-
ly on electricity markets. A smaller number of studies address
energy demand in the agricultural sector and impacts on ener-
gy supply investments. The impact of climate change on
energy demand will be perceptible but modest in relation to
the impact of factors such as changes in technology and pat-
terns of economic activity.

"of energy for heating in winter is balanced by an
increase due to cooling in summer. At Naha (26°N), the
overall energy load will be increased by 50 MJ/m? due
to a 1°C temperature rise. Rosenthal, Gruenspecht, and
Moran (1995) concluded that a 1°C global warming
would reduce total U.S. energy use associated with
space heating and air conditioning by 1 petajoule (PJ),
11% of demand, in the year 2010. Costs would be
reduced by $5.5 billion (1991$). A 2.5°C global warm-
ing would reduce total costs by $12.2 billion (1993$).
This estimate accounts for the latitudinal and seasonal
variations in warming but not for daily variations.
Peak Demand—In the UK, peak demand for heating
fuels will decline less than total annual demand, lead-
ing to a reduced demand load factor. This would be
due partly to a shorter heating season (UK Climate
Change Impacts Review Group, 1991). The seasonal
occurrence of the peak demand for electricity is an
important factor. If peak demand occurs in winter,
maximum demand is likely to fall, whereas if there is
a summer peak, maximum demand will rise. The pre-
cise effects are highly dependent on the climate zone
(Linder and Inglis, 1989). Climate change may cause
some areas to switch from a winter peaking to a sum-
mer peaking regime.
"	List
"Fossil Fuel Demand—Climate change will cause the
use of fossil fuels for space heating to decline. For
example, a temperature increase of 1.3-2.9°C in the
UK could reduce the demand for natural gas by
7-20% in 2050 compared with demand without the
effects of climate change (UK Climate Change
Impacts Review Group, 1991). In the MINK
(Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas) region of the
United States it has been suggested that fossil fuel
demand for space heating would decrease by 7-16%
as a result of a temperature increase of 0.8°C
(Darmstadter, 1991).

Electricity Demand—Whether electricity demand is
likely to rise or fall as a result of climate change
depends on the relative importance of space heating
or air conditioning (Linder et al., 1989). In areas with
a high summer load associated with cooling, climate
change will result in increased electricity demand.
Conversely, where there is a high winter load associ-
ated with space heating, demand is likely to fall. In
some temperate zones, where air conditioning is
growing in importance, it is not clear whether in the
long-term the increase in demand for cooling will
exceed the reduction in demand for heating (UK
Climate Change Impacts Review Group, 1991).
Total Energy Demand—According to a study refer-
ring to representative residential buildings conducted oy
the Japan Architecture Society (1992), temperature rise
will lead to a reduction in energy consumption in
Sapporo (43°N), whereas in Tokyo (36°N) the reduction

"Changes in energy demand in agriculture will largely be driven
by changes in the level of food production on existing land,
especially in developing countries. Changes in energy inputs to
fertilizers would be an important indirect impact. Climate
change, however, would have some direct impacts on energy
needs. The MINK study (Darmstadter, 1991) included some
approximate estimates of the impacts of a 0.6—-0.9°C tempera-
ture rise on energy needs for irrigation pumping and crop dry-
ing. Energy demand for pumping would rise by around 25%,
while demand for crop drying would decline by around 10%.
Irrigation pumping demand is likely to be more sensitive to
changes in temperature than to changes in precipitation
(Wolock et al., 1992). Taking into account the proportion of
agricultural energy demand associated with pumping and dry-
ing, Darmstadter concluded that energy demand in agriculture
in the MINK region would rise by less than 3% as a result of
climate change. This conclusion appears not to have been
based on any specific assumptions about climate-induced
changes in cropping patterns.

approximately the current best estimate for the year 2100—and
$11--33 billion for a 100 cm rise. Dikes would not be used on
barrier islands because of their narrowness and aesthetic con-

of transportation infrastructure and infrastructure needs are of
great potential importance. Transportation requirements are
closely linked to patterns of human settlement and have been
addressed in this context in several infrastructure-based assess-
ments (e.g., Walker et al., 1989). Changes in the nature and
location of agricultural production, in the rates of population
growth in different regions, in the volumes and types of fossil
fuels used, and in tourism and recreational travel can have pro-
found effects on the performance of existing transportation
facilities and on requirements to construct new ones. Although
it is widely acknowledged that climate change could produce
significant redistributions of population and economic activi-
ties, particularly agriculture, detailed geographic predictions of
these phenomena are lacking (Johnson, 1991; Jansen et al.,
1991). Such regional predictions are a prerequisite for quantita-
tive assessment of the impacts of regional redistribution on
transportation.

Existing assessments of transportation impacts have recog-
nized the potential significance of changes in geographical pat-
terns of economic activity on the transportation network. Black
(1990) notes that even gradual, long-term global warming
could cause a major disruption of the movement of goods and
people in North America. Irwin and Johnson (1988) suggest
that there would probably be a northward spreading of agricul-
tural, forestry, and mining activities, resulting in increased pop-
ulation and intensified settlement patterns in Canada’s mid-
north and even in Arctic areas. Marine, road, rail, and air links
would have to be expanded accordingly. While this would
entail substantial extra capital and operating costs, it would
also be an economic opportunity.

While increasing temperatures may open up regions to
increased development in northern climates, sea-level rise may
also force massive migrations from settlements on river deltas
and other low-lying areas. Jansen, Kuik,. and Spiegel (1991)
point out that a possible 26% land loss in Bangladesh would
displace 27% of the population and that a 21% land loss in

of the time it takes a vehicle to warm up (Murrell, 1980). The
impact on overall fuel economy of a few degrees’ increase in

cent. Vehicle emissions are also affected by temperature, espe-
cially evaporative emissions of hydrocarbons (U.S. EPA, 1989).

is likely to be on inland and coastal water transportation. A
longer season for Arctic shipping is likely, with a greater num-

Inland waterways, however, may suffer loss of depth for greater
periods of seasonal drought, reducing their usefulness for com-
mercial shipping (Black, 1990). A survey of the potential
impacts on Canadian shipping suggested net benefits to Arctic
and ocean shipping due to deeper drafts in ports and longer nav-
igational seasons, but mixed results for lake and river shipping
due to the opposing effects of a longer shipping season but
lower drafts (Irwin and Johnson, 1988). In Siberia, many rivers
are used as solid roads during winter. Warmer winters would
require a shift to water transport or the construction of more all-
weather roads. Other climate impacts could arise from changes
in snowfall or melting of the permafrost (IBI Group, 1990).

Increased rainfall in winter, which may occur in mid-latitudes,

impacts of frost on construction activity. In areas such as
Siberia, however, warming could cause permafrost shrinkage
and lead to structural damage. If wind speeds were to increase,
there would be a need to pay greater attention to wind protec-

provide a basis for examining future climate impacts on site

"Transportation infrastructure could be lost to inundation in
coastal areas when sea levels rise and shorelines recede,
although port infrastructure may be rebuilt sufficiently often to
avoid such threats. Many airports are located at low levels. The
impacts of sea-level rise have been rigorously examined in a
few studies. In a detailed assessment of impacts at six sites on
the eastern and Gulf coasts of the United States, Daniels et al.
(1992) found that impacts varied greatly from city to city. For
example, under a low sea-level rise scenario, 40% of the trans-
portation, communications, and utilities infrastructure of
Galveston, Texas, would be below mean sea level by 2050, and
half by 2100. Under the moderate and high sea-level rise sce-
narios, approximately half would be below sea level by 2050
and all by 2100 (Daniels et al., 1992, Table 4.7). A similar
study of the Daytona Beach, Florida, area concluded that only
about 10% of the transportation infrastructure was subject to
inundation (Daniels et al., 1992, Table 4.19). The impacts of
sea-level rise on transportation infrastructure in low-lying
countries such as Bangladesh and Egypt would be massive

river-based power plants toward coastal siting (Smith and Tirpak,

are reducing the dependence of fossil fuel-fired power generation
systems on the availability of cooling water (UK Climate Change

"The global aluminum industry is exceptionally energy intensive
and, in 1990, utilized an estimated 280 terawatt-hours (TWh) of
electricity (Young, 1992) to convert alumina into 16.3 million
metric tons of primary aluminum metal (Plunkert and Sehnke,
1993). Production of aluminum metal is distributed among 41
countries, many of which lack bauxite ore but possess abundant
energy resources. The United States is unusual in that only
12.4% of its energy for aluminum production comes from
hydroelectricity (Aluminum Association, 1991), whereas most
of the other major producers—such as Brazil, Canada, and
Ghana—tely almost exclusively on hydroelectricity (Plunkert
and Sehnke, 1993). In the six years since 1988, Russian exports
have expanded six-fold and now account for 10% of world pro-

development programs and the industrial base of many devel-
oping countries. Brazil, for example, now ranks fourth in the
world in terms of hydroelectricity production after Canada, the
United States, and the former Soviet republics. Developing
countries would be particularly hard hit by a reduction in hydro-

with an annual revenue loss of $36.55 million (Canadian dol-

domestic agriculture, changes in world commodity prices, and
the relative strength of the country as a net food importer or
exporter. The benefits to producers will be larger than the loss-

scenario associated with a regional temperature rise of 1-2°C
and a 10% increase in rainfall (Asian Development Bank,
1994). Yield loss could rise to 25-40% due to the effects of
temperature on the viscosity of resin when the tree is tapped. In
Indonesia, the Philippines, coastal South Asia, and Indochina,
warming for a CO, doubling could be in the range 0.5-3.0°C
(CSIRO, 1992a). Adaptation to climate change could involve
preparing for new developments outside the 10°N latitude
zones. Plantations could be protected from high winds and
colder winds by planting dense buffer trees to act as wind-

Asia, which might become drier. All of these measures could
push up the cost of natural rubber and encourage substitution

Biomass is estimated to account for 12-15% of global primary
energy consumption (World Energy Council, 1993b; Hall et
al., 1993). After oil, coal, and natural gas, biomass is the
world’s most important source of energy. Trees are the most
important source (64%) of biomass fuels in both urban and
rural areas. The remainder consists of animal dung and crop
residues used in the countryside. A total of 88.5% of wood bio-
mass is used as firewood and the rest as charcoal (Smith et al.,
1993). Biomass is the most important source of energy in
developing countries, where it accounts for 38% of consump-
tion (Hall et al., 1993). In some of the least industrialized coun-
tries, where there is limited access to electricity grids, 90% of
energy needs is met by biomass. Financial constraints may also
force people to use biomass in cities (see Chapters 12 and 22).
Biomass in the domestic sector is used primarily for cooking,
although it is also used for space heating in regions with cold
winters—for example, Nepal and northern China. Biofuels are
transported to cities by draft animals and lorries, sometimes
over long distances. In the Sahelian countries of Africa, biofu-
el trade is a well-organized sector with impressive turnovers
(Sow, 1990). Biogas generated by anaerobic fermentation is
used mainly in the Asian countryside. According to Dutt and
Ravindranath (1993), more than four million family house gen-
erators have been installed in China and one million in India.
The numbers are growing rapidly.

with some large-scale renewable energy projects, transporta-

necessary to anticipate climate change by assessing how
demand for facilities may be affected by climate in the long-
term and how climate might influence technical aspects of
design. The development of climate guidelines is necessary for
the construction and location of coastal structures such as sea-
walls, harbors, jetties, piers, and causeways that have long

be indirect, as well as direct. Direct effects of sea-level rise

indirectly through effects on other sectors (for example,
changes in water supply, agricultural productivity, and human
migration). We have high confidence in the importance of
these indirect effects because they depend on well-known
mechanisms of social interaction rather than data specific to
the climate of the future.

"Climate change will occur against a background of other non-
climate environmental factors and socioeconomic factors that
could either exacerbate or mitigate the effects of climate
change. These other factors may, in many cases, dominate cli-
mate change. As compared with the 1990 or 1992 IPCC assess-
ments of impacts, this discussion emphasizes the multiple and
interactive pathways by which climate change exacerbates or
mitigates the effects of other events that nations may find
important. These interactions could occur in unexpected ways,
with small changes having disproportionately large outcomes.
The major conclusions follow.

"Health risks are potentially very large, especially in the
informal settlements on the fringes of megacities of the devel-
oping world, but the probabilities are difficult to estimate.
Current patterns of urbanization, extended into the next centu-
ry, suggest that the most vulnerable human populations may
become even more vulnerable. Economic and environmental
refugees may introduce a number of exotic diseases into tem-
perate-zone human settlements. Increased climate variability
and associated extreme events can add new breéding sites and
new bursts of activity for vector-borne diseases. This finding
relies on the best thinking of the community of epidemiolo-
gists, but our confidence in the finding varies with the particu-
lar disease and location and because necessary supporting
environmental data are adequate in some cases and extremely
sketchy in others (see also Chapter 18).

"A significant potential for noncoastal flooding (river
basin and local urban flooding) is expected if precipita-
tion intensity increases as a result of climate change.
The IPCC Working Group I volume (Chapter 6, Climate
Models—Projections of Future Climate) states that precipitation
intensity may increase and that several models now project
increases in higher-rainfall events. If intensity increases, the
tisk of flooding to settlement infrastructure could be very
widely distributed across the planet, not just in coastal zones.
One particular problem in providing estimates of damage is
specifying the extent of future human intrusion into disaster-
prone areas. We have low confidence in this finding because
the consensus of climate modelers concerning the effects of
climate change on intense rainfall events does not extend to
regions and localities and because the degree of adaptation is
likely to be important.
"	Text
"Thresholds beyond which impacts escalate quickly are
unique to individual local situations and tend to depend
on the degree of adaptive response. For example, the
impact of sea-level rise on coastal communities critically
depends on the degree to which human lives and assets can be
protected, insured, or shifted to new locations that are
unthreatened. As discussed in 1990 and 1992, the human set-
tlements most vulnerable to climate change are likely to be in
locations already stressed by high rates of population growth,
urbanization, and environmental degradation. However, in
addition to islands, coastal communities, and communities
dependent on marginal rain-fed agriculture or commercial
fishing discussed in the previous reports, vulnerable settle~
ments include large primary coastal cities and especially
squatter settlements located in flood plains and on steep hill-
sides. We have medium confidence in this result. The con-
sensus is strong concerning the principle, but the data sup-
porting it apply mainly to analogous circumstances.

"The 1990 and 1992 IPCC assessments dealt only with the
direct effects of climate on human settlements, primarily infra-
structure issues. The more subtle effects of human-settlement
metabolism may be more important in some instances.
Moreover, consideration of the indirect effects of climate
change shifts the focus of attention from a narrow and neces-
sarily speculative concern over future impacts on infrastructure
to the more general pressing problems of economic and social
development. Included in development could be an adaptation
policy that includes a variety of adaptive mechanisms.

"A major difficulty in determining the impact of climate change
on human habitat is the fact that many other factors, largely
independent of climate change, are also important. In many
cases, these other factors are far more important than climate
change in terms of the risk they pose for human settlements.
These non-climate factors will also increase the vulnerability
of some regions to climate change. The most important of these
factors include population growth, urbanization and industrial-
ization, technology choices, and government policies. Other
social factors, such as cultural clashes and warfare, also play a
role. Vulnerability of settlements has to be judged on the basis
of the susceptibility of the settlement’s resources to damage via
climate change, conditioned by the resilience of the resources
and the technical, institutional, economic, and cultural capabil-
ities of the settlement to cope with or manage the change

"settlements but also the relationships between human settle-
ments and these other, more directly affected, sectors. Finally,
this chapter discusses adaptive responses to climate change—
both those. that may be taken autonomously by human settle-
ments in response to climate change and other stresses and
those that may be undertaken as a matter of deliberate adaptive
policy by governments. Some readers will be disappointed that
the chapter contains very few quantitative estimates of impact.
This is by design. The very variety of human settlements and
complexity of their environmental circumstances assure that
almost any impact estimates will be local in scope and that both
the absolute and relative importance of the various effects will
be different in almost every circumstance. Except for sea-level
rise, where some international estimates exist, the few estimates
in the literature of the impact of climate change on human-set-
tlement infrastructure and inhabitants are local and regional in
scope. No study has yet attempted the difficult aggregation of
climate and non-climate effects required for a proper analysis.
Thus, the quantitative estimates provided in the chapter should
be regarded as illustrative and anecdotal in nature.

"A potentially important way in which climate change could
affect human beings is through its effects on human settlements.
Settlements, especially cities, have a central role in civilization
as the primary generators of human wealth and the engines of
social interaction and change. Whether explicitly acknowledged
or not, environmentally appropriate economic and social devel-
opment in settlements is a major goal of national environmen-
tal policy throughout the world. According to the United
Nations Centre for Human Settlements, a human settlement can
be judged on four criteria: (1) the quality of life it offers to its
inhabitants; (2) the scale of nonrenewable resource use (includ-
ing reuse); (3) the scale and nature of the use of renewable
resources and the implications. of the settlement’s demands for
sustaining production levels of these resources; and (4) the scale
and nature of nonreusable wastes generated by production and
consumption activities, the means by which these are disposed
of, and the extent to which wastes affect human health, natural
systems, and amenity values (Habitat, 1992a). Climate change
could affect the sustainability of human settlements either by
directly affecting the quality of life in settlements (e.g., by
changing the probability of floods or the effects of air-pollution
episodes), by modifying the effects of the settlements on their
surrounding environments (e.g., by changing the demand for
water or changing the assimilation capacity of wetlands), or by
changing the economic underpinnings of the settlement (e.g., by
changing the productivity of croplands, forests, or fisheries on
which the settlement depends).

"Since 1950, the number of people living in cities has tripled,
increasing by more than 1.25 billion (World Commission on
Environment and Development, 1987). By 1980, nearly one in
three persons was an urban dweller, and one in ten lived in a
city with a million or more inhabitants (a “million city”). By
1990, an estimated 42.65% of the world’s people were urban
residents. It has been estimated that by 2025 60% of the
world’s people will be living in towns and cities. In many
countries, the fastest-growing areas are in coastal regions and
estuaries, many of which are vulnerable to extreme events and
sea-level rise (Marco and Cayuela, 1992). Already, two-thirds
of the world population lives within 60 km of the coast; this is
expected to rise to 75% by the year 2010 (WCC’93, 1994). The
developed world has heavily concentrated its people in coastal
areas (Friedman, 1984; Handmer, 1989; Marco, 1992;
Boissonade and Davy, 1993; Lester, 1993; Skinner et al., 1993;

"The population of the world is estimated at about 5.3 billion.
At its peak in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the average annu-
al rate. of increase in the world’s population was close to 2%.
Projections suggest that this rate of increase will fall to less
_ than 1% by the second decade of the 21st century. However,
the rate of abatement in the growth rate is expected to vary
sharply from region to region. For example, whereas the
world’s population as a whole is expected to grow at 1.3% per
year on average between 2000 and 2025, population is expect-
ed to grow at 2.1% in low-income countries but at only 0.2%
in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) countries (World Bank, 1991). Further,
the differences in birth rates between rural and urban areas
have widened, according to the United Nations World Fertility
Survey (1986). Regions already struggling to cope with
exploding populations can be expected to be exceptionally vul-
nerable to climate change.

"In the 1980s, many developing countries not only failed to keep
pace with the industrial countries but saw their incomes fall.
The living standards of millions in Latin America are now lower
than in the early 1970s; in most of sub-Saharan Africa, living
standards have fallen to levels last seen in the 1960s. According
to some estimates, the percentage of the world’s population liv-
ing in absolute poverty decreased, at least up to the middle of
the 1980s, but the absolute number of poor has increased
(United Nations, 1989; Gilbert, 1992). It was estimated that in
1985 1.115 billion people lived in poverty in the developing
world. That is approximately one-third of the total population of
the developing world. Of these, 630 million were extremely
poor (World Bank, 1990). Nearly half of the developing world’s
poor, and nearly half of those in extreme poverty, live in South
Asia, followed in order by sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East
and North Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, and East Asia
(World Bank, 1990). What is particularly relevant for environ-
mental management purposes is that poverty has “urbanized”:

"growing by an average of 3.6% per year compared to only 0.8%
in the industrialized countries, which are believed to have
essentially completed their urbanization process and in some
cases are de-urbanizing. The uncontrolled expansion of towns
and cities in the developing countries has led to overwhelmed
transport, communications, water-supply, sanitation, and energy
systems. Urban sprawl preempts other land uses near these
towns and cities. Between 1980 and 2000, urban areas in devel-
oping countries are expected to grow from about 8 million
hectares to more than 17 million hectares. The development
policy in most developing countries after World War II favored
modernization biased toward the urban-industrial sector, espe-
cially manufacturing targeted to satisfy domestic demand. In
Latin America, for example, “import-substitution industrializa-
tion” registered an unprecedented success between 1950 and
1970; the regional gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an
annual average rate of 5%. However, rural public investment
was neglected, and the rural labor force was economically mar-
ginalized. Excess rural labor migrated to urban unemployment
and informal activities (PNUMA/MOPU/AECI, 1989, Part III).
Some analyses emphasize the attraction of cities (“pull factor”)
in the rural exodus, while others point out the aggravation of
high rural population growth and the expelling process in rural
areas (“push factor”). The latter definitely played a fundamen-
tal role in migration. In the last decades, rural life conditions
have experienced continuous deterioration in relative and
absolute terms, and large sectors of peasants have been exclud-
ed from the modernization process (Armstrong and McGee,
1985, Chapters 4 and 5), leaving them more vulnerable to cli-
mate variability. Growing scales of urban metabolism (urban
demands for natural resources and the increase in the inflow and
outflow of materials, products, energy, water, people, and
wastes) add to pressures on the environment and could exacer-
bate the effects of climate change. Particularly salient has been
the rapid growth of motorized transportation in urban areas.

circumstances (Habitat, 1992b). In addition, it restricts the abil-

may be more environmentally appropriate. In some cases,
poverty restricts access to education and information about bet-

drains, culverts, bridges, dikes, and dams. Based on historical
data, these are built to withstand 25-year, 50-year, 100-year, or
400-year floods. If rainfall intensity increases with climate
change (Pittock, 1994), these structures either would have to be
built to a higher standard or a greater probability of damage
accepted. A structure strong enough to withstand a 25-year
flood in the future might have to be strong enough to withstand
a flood now considered to be a 100-year event. Today’s struc-
tures would have a higher risk of failure. Lowering this risk
would require investments that compete for very limited dis-

"The rights and conditions under which land is held (land-tenure

about this, and land-tenure systems can result in mismatches
between population and productive land. Some traditional land-

For example, in some West African land-tenure systems, tenure
goes with the crop, not the land. This system encouraged the
growing of perennial crops, such as trees. Subsequent conver-

waste is land disposal, either sanitary landfill or simply dis-
posing of the waste on unused land, Leakage and runoff from
landfills and wastes released to surface waters adversely affect
the quality of ground and surface waters. In some cases, an
incinerator is used to reduce the volume of the organic compo-
nent (Habitat, 1992a). To reduce the burden on landfills,
resource recovery by one of several strategies can be pursued
and may be more likely in less-wealthy settlements (Habitat,
1992a). However, if settlements are poor, less-safe technolo-
gies may be used for disposal. If climate changes, the assim-
ilative capacity of airsheds may be reduced because of
increased prevalence of stagnant-air episodes, while sea-level
rise and potential flooding could restrict the availability of land
for safe disposal of solid waste. At the same time, demand for
disposal areas continues to rise.

"The choices that people make concerning which technology is
used to provide a given service may have a dramatic impact on
the degree to which a given change in climate will affect
human settlements. For example, periodic additions of mecha-
nization in North American agriculture during the last century
(e.g, tractors, self-propelled harvesters, center-pivot irrigation)
have significantly reduced the number of people engaged in
agriculture and the accompanying requirements for their eco-
nomic and social support services. As a consequence, there are
now fewer settlements dependent on agriculture or likely to be
directly affected by drought, flood, or other weather incidents.
Previous choices of technology may also considerably restrict
the options available for adaptation. For example, the ordinary
operating life of commercial buildings in the United States is
about 80 to 90 years (Pierce, 1994), whereas the life of water-
supply systems is around 50 years (Internal Revenue Service,
1994), It follows that climate changes occurring in the first half
of the 21st century would affect energy and water-supply sys-
tems that will mostly look like today’s. The viability of entire
transportation systems—for example, the bias that exists
toward automobiles in many human settlements throughout the
world—is influenced strongly by past technological choices
and spatial patterns of settlement that grew up around these
choices. This, in turn, has significantly influenced the long-
term livability and viability of these settlements.

limit settlement) can reduce adverse interactions between devel-
opment and climate. However, governments may lack the gover-
nance capacity or will to adequately regulate land uses and
respond to hazards (Beatley, 1994) or may face sometimes-irrec-
oncilable duties to make settlements both affordable and safe. This
quandary manifests itself in floodplains in the conflict over mak-
ing flood insurance affordable and available without, at the same
time, encouraging settlement in areas that have to be defended at
great cost (Armell, 1983; Henri, 1991; Murray, 1991; Denlea,
1994), In addition, government infrastructure investments and
other actions can themselves create unfavorable environmental
outcomes. In Mexico, Australia, and India, for example, govern-
ment investment in irrigation has sometimes resulted in high soil
salinity and difficulties for the farm communities (Liverman,
1992; Leichenko and Westcoat, 1993). Water-management pro-
jects established to cope with frequent drought or flooding have
also created poorly assimilated refugee populations. For example,
the creation of Lake Kariba, between Zambia and Zaire, has mar-
ginalized the Tonga people (Magadza, 1991). Numerous other
examples are cited by Gleick (1992). Many of the adverse envi-
ronmental consequences of urban slums occur because residents
lack clear legal tenure and because of the lack of land-use controls.

one-third of the population in many developing-world cities lives

"Space conditioning of buildings is one of the most climate-sen-
sitive uses of energy—especially the use of electricity for resi-
dential and commercial air conditioning, and electricity plus
other fuels for space heating. Although usually smaller in total
magnitude of energy demand, the use of electricity and fuels
for irrigation pumping and the use of fuels for drying of agri-
cultural crops also can be significant weather-sensitive
demands in some regions (Scott et al., 1993; Darmstadter,
1993). Climate change has negligible direct effect on vehicle
performance, but transportation activities are sensitive to
immediate impacts from weather and may be indirectly sensi-
tive to gradual shifts in human activities as they respond to cli-
mate change and to greenhouse and environmental strategies.
For example, if warming should accelerate urbanization ten-
dencies caused by adverse effects on the rural resource base,
additional urban congestion could reduce vehicle performance
in cities. This performance decline provides incentives for
transportation modal shifts (to public transit, for example).

"Changes in population, wealth and activities of the population,
energy prices, cost and characteristics of technologies used,
and daily and seasonal operational patterns for these technolo-
gies help drive urban energy demand. For example, discrete
zoning of residential and commercial areas may cause higher
levels of transportation use (Matsuoka ef al., 1992). D.W.
Jones (1991) found that urbanization was an important deter-
minant of energy demand, though less important than per capi-
ta income and industrialization. Mechanization of food deliv-
ery and journey to work are major factors. Because the effects
of climate change appear to be small in comparison with poten-
tial changes caused by these other factors, adjustments can be
made to accommodate climate change at small to moderate
cost (Linder and Inglis, 1989). A special consideration in con-
sidering the effects of urbanization on energy use is the urban
“heat island” effect, in which the replacement of vegetative
ground cover in urban settlements with structures, streets, and
similar surfaces causes outdoor temperatures within these set-
tlements to be several degrees higher than they otherwise
would be (Boodhoo, 1991). Energy consumed for air condi-
tioning may increase heat-island effects (Hanaki, 1993), Heat-
island effects and actions to reduce them are further discussed
in Chapter 22 in the context of the extra energy that must be
expended in buildings to counteract heat-island effects.

large relative decreases in their very small heating loads of
50% or more, virtually eliminating the requirement to heat.

rapid growth in residential energy use in developing and newly
industrialized countries to an increase in the number of house-
holds and electrification. Market penetration of air condition-
ers is still low in most countries, but once they become afford-
able their proliferation can be very rapid, particularly in hot cli-

Thailand, Taiwan, and Brazil, which also have humid climates
(Schipper and Meyers, 1992). In Taiwan, air-conditioner mar-

market penetration of air conditioning in Japan is close to 60%.
Similar findings are reported by Sathaye and Tyler (1991) and

"Although cooking usually is a more important end use than
heating, woodfuels are particularly important in developing
countries because of their (typically) low cost and the simplic-

Among the largest potential impacts of climate change on the
developing world are the threats in many areas to fuelwood and
charcoal, which are principal sources of energy in most sub-
Saharan African nations and many other developing countries.
For example, cities and towns place large demands on adjacent
and distant forests. Bamako, the capital of Mali, is supplied by
a zone with a 100-km radius (Simmons, 1989), but most of the
612 tons per day arriving in Delhi, India comes from 700 km
away in Madya Pradesh (Hardoy et al., 1992), and charcoal
from northern Thailand is exported to Bangladesh (Tolba et al.,

is known to be scarce around Kinshasa in Zaire, Brazzaville in
the Congo, Nairobi in Kenya, Niamey in Niger, Ouagadougo in
Burkina Faso, and in much of Nepal (Williams, 1990). More
than 90% of the energy in some African countries depends on
biomass (fuelwood). Even if climate does not change, the
combination of population growth and a declining resource in
some cases will bring cost pressure to change the fuels for

some forms of long-term adaptation, notably the modification
of building design and space-heating or air-conditioning sys-

net balance of energy demand depends largely on the balance
between cooling and heating in the residential and commercial
sectors (Linder et al., 1987; Scott et al., 1993; Rosenthal,
Gruenspecht, and Mann, 1995). In the commercial sector, air
conditioning accounts for a greater proportion of final energy
demand, partly because of internal heat gains from lighting,
office equipment, and occupants. Generally, in cool areas with
limited air conditioning, space-heating fuel use and electricity
demand for heating (and, sometimes, total electricity demand)
would likely decline (Stokoe et al., 1987; Singh, 1988; Mundy,
1990; Aittoniemi, 1991a, 1991b; UK Climate Change Impacts
Review Group, 1991; Scott et al., 1993), Where cooling is
already more important than heating or may become more
important, the increase in cooling demand will be greater than
the decrease in heating demand (Loveland and Brown, 1990).

chemical time bomb is defined as a time-delayed, nonlinear
response of soils, sediments, and groundwaters to stored pollu-

Land-use modifications driven by changes in water availabili-

"Climate change does not directly lead to air, water, or soil-col-
umn pollution. However, if changes in climate significantly
alter local and regional weather patterns, underlying trends in
pollution damage may change nonlinearly. This issue received
only brief attention in the 1990 and 1992 assessments. Global
monitoring of urban air quality in cities indicates that nearly
900 million people are exposed to unhealthy levels of sulfur
dioxide (SO,) and more than 1 billion are exposed to excessive
levels of particulates (Schteingart, 1988). While cities such as
Manchester, London, Tokyo, and Frankfurt have seen great
improvements in air quality (especially SO), other cities in the
low latitudes have increased SO, levels. Moreover, photo-
chemical smog produced by the reaction of sunlight with ozone
and photochemical oxidants, such as peroxyacetal nitrate
(PAN) from nitrogen oxides (NO,) and hydrocarbon emissions,
is particularly prevalent in cities in semi-arid regions, such as
Los Angeles, Tehran, and Mexico City. In British cities, NO, is
probably of more concern now than sulfur oxides (SO,).
Warming can exacerbate the formation of smog. Global warm-
ing appears likely to aggravate tropospheric ozone and other

now-mandatory pollution-monitoring and emission-control equipment.

Checking vehicular exhaust emissions became mandatory in late 1989. From 1991 onward, the regulation was
changed to compulsory verification every six months for heavy-use vehicles and yearly for all other vehicles.
The use of each car was banned one day of the week, according to the numbers on the license plate, to reduce
the circulation of vehicles by approximately 500,000 cars, on average, during working days.

In 1991, unleaded gasoline and catalytic converters became obligatory in all new cars. However, the lower lev-
els of lead increased the amount of unburned oil residues—which, in turn, increased the ozone formed in the air
of the city during daylight hours (Bravo et al., 1991).

The two thermoelectric plants in the basin increased their consumption of natural gas as a substitute for oil.

increase fourfold by the year 2070 (Gordon et al., 1992; Smith,
1993; Whetton et al., 1993; Bates ef al., 1994); that is, the 100-
year flood would become the 25-year flood. If so, design and
safety standards would have to be revised for culverts, drains,
bridges, dikes, and dams. Moreover, existing infrastructure
would be more vulnerable to failure (Minnery and Smith,
1994). Lake levels in many regions in the world are known to
fluctuate under current climate conditions, in some cases
changing more rapidly than settlements can adapt to easily
(Dejoux and Iltis, 1992) or influencing water quality (Gafny

of varying precipitation and runoff and because of variations in
human withdrawal of water for a variety of purposes. Climate

these physical assets has come because of rising per capita
wealth (Stavely, 1991; Central Statistical Office, 1994). These
assets are often housed in lightly constructed residential prop-

accounted for 65% of ail insured losses (IRC, 1995). Use of
modern construction materials (e.g., aluminum sheeting used
for roofing) and aesthetic design features without sufficient
understanding of their appropriate use has compounded the
damages of extreme events. Modern buildings are difficult to
repair if structural pillars are damaged (Jakobi, 1993), and
exterior and contents damages also can add up to severe losses
(FEMA, 1992). Although the amount or proportion of national
physical assets exposed to climate hazards is not readily avail-
able, it is known that in the United States about $2 trillion in
insured property value lies within 30 km of coasts exposed to
Atlantic hurricanes (IRC, 1995); in the Netherlands $186 bil-

$807 billion (WCC, 1993, 1994), and in Australia, $25 billion

change on human health. More recent thought reveals several
additional causes for concern (see Chapter 18 for details). This
section describes the specific role of human settlements. Climate-
related changes in human settlements may affect several elements
that are critical to human heaith. Kalkstein (1993) and Kalkstein
and Smoyer (1993) suggest that the major potential pathways are
heat stress directly causing premature mortality (particularly in
nonacclimated, unprotected populations in hotter developing
countries); outbreaks of infectious diseases whose ranges change
because of changes in human migration patterns and spread by
contact or close proximity between infected and noninfected indi-
viduals; and effects of infectious diseases whose agents, vectors,
hosts, ecological niches, or predators on vectors are affected by
climate, or compounded by changes in land use, eutrophication of
waters, and other anthropogenic environmental insults, such as
acid rain or pesticides. The infectious diseases include several seri-
ous tropical diseases. In addition, if water supplies are disrupted as
a result of more frequent droughts and floods, the full range of
nontropical waterborne diseases such as cholera, typhoid, diar-
theal, and helminth diseases (hookworm, roundworm, etc.) spread
by unsafe drinking water may come into play more frequently.

Chagas can be spread directly by blood transfusions. A greater
number of heat waves could increase the risk of excess mortality.
Increased heat stress in summer is likely to increase heat-related
deaths and illnesses (Kalkstein and Smoyer, 1993). Deaths due to

increase in blooms worldwide is thought to be a direct conse-
quence of human activities on a local or regional scale that
could be reinforced by the existence of environmental condi-

severe typhoons and that deaths have been declining in all cat-

occurred because increasingly effective countermeasures have
been taken during the last 40 years, including more robust
infrastructure design standards. These countermeasures appear
to be more effective with respect to the mid-class Grade III

The most vulnerable areas are those under the influence of sub-

temperatures because evapotranspiration would be enhanced,
reducing soil moisture. Agricultural settlements in regions such

1992b). The list includes both actions autonomously taken by
humans and deliberate, planned, climate-adjustment actions
nurtured by policy. Where data are available, the section also
discusses the costs of adaptation. However, not enough focused
research has been done on adaptation to permit full compar-
isons between adaptation and mitigation of climate change or
even to fully characterize the costs of adaptation. Although
regional and local governments may have limited powers or
boundaries that do not correspond to natural physical systems
affected by climate change, a holistic approach needs to be
taken to planning human settlements. Each settlement must
fulfill multiple objectives, of which adaptation to climate will
be only one (and in many cases, not even a very important
one). Examples of this holistic approach may be found in
Douglas (1983) or White (1994). Sector-by-sector adaptations
are discussed in Sections 12.5.1 through 12.5.6.

"One of the potentially destructive effects from a variety of
social and economic perspectives is forced internal or interna-
tional population movement—both low-key, long-term
migrants responding to relative economic opportunity by mov-
ing between regions and from rural areas to cities, and “eco-
logical refugees” responding to specific natural disasters.
Economic migration can be reduced if economic opportunity
and services of civilization can be delivered to the regions of
origin and thus prevent the population movement (Calva
Tellez, 1992; Rello, 1993). This reduction can be accomplished
in part by immigration/emigration policies if regional (espe-
cially rural) and national economic development are undertak-
en at the same time. Controlling the degree of urbanization
appears to be doubtful as a solution (Shukla and Parikh, 1992).
Decentralizing government administration to secondary cities
reduces to some degree the impact of population movements
on primary cities because the “pull” effect of government
employment is distributed among several locations. Economic
dislocation programs, such as disaster assistance, can offset
some of the more serious negative consequences of climate
change and reduce the number of ecological refugees.
Effective land-use regulation can help direct population shifts
away from vulnerable locations such as floodplains, steep hill-
sides, and low-lying coastlines.

"A number of specific actions can be taken to offset the effects
of climate change in the energy sector. Increased building-
shell efficiency and changes to building design that reduce air-
conditioning load show promise (Scott et al., 1994), Though
effective, however, some strategies may have other costs
(Loveland and Brown, 1990). Air conditioning may offset some
of the more deleterious effects of heat waves, although because
acclimatization is reduced, this is not necessarily so
(McMichael, 1993). Reducing the size of space-heating capaci-
ty in response to warmer climate would be a logical adaptive
response in more temperate and polar countries and may free up
investment funds for other purposes, even within the energy
sector. Community design to reduce heat islands (through judi-
cious use of vegetation and light-colored surfaces) (Akbari et
al., 1992), reducing motor transportation, and taking advantage
of solar resources also should be included in the package of pos-
sibilities. Many of these actions, such as urban tree planting and
urban mass transit, are typically justified as mitigation options
to reduce fossil-fuel use in the urban buildings sector (see
Chapter 22) or to reduce the adverse energy-use, congestion,
and health consequences of transportation networks that are
based on automobiles and motorized two-wheelers (see Chapter
21). Full environmental and health costing of fossil fuels, which

these same mitigative responses also have adaptive value in that
they reduce the impact of warming on urban discomfort caused
by heat-island effects.

"Some of these actions have unexpected social costs if not
planned appropriately. For example, urban trees can be aes-
thetically attractive while reducing air-pollution and heat-
island effects, altering local meteorological conditions, and
providing shelter from wind (NCPI, 1992), However, they also
can accelerate desiccation of clay soils (Freeman, 1992)—
leading to subsidence—and contribute windthrow to property
damage during high-wind events (Stavely, 1991; Shearn,
1994). See Chapter 17 for further details.

"Reducing industrial pollution is a desirable activity under
current climate because it can not only reduce acute health-
threatening conditions like heat waves but also can reduce
other pollution-related problems, such as the buildup of heavy
metals in the environment, loss of aquatic biodiversity, and loss
of forested areas. Reductions in the burning of fossil fuels not
only have an impact in solving all of the foregoing problems
but have mitigative effects on global warming itself. Reducing
automotive traffic in sensitive airsheds has a similar effect, as
does substitution of more benign fuel types (e.g., natural gas
for coal and the use of unleaded gasoline).

Such control is difficult to maintain in poor cities that lack

"As described in the 1992 assessment with respect to the coastal
zone in particular, available adaptive responses to flooding fall
broadly into three categories: retreat, accommodation, and pro-
tection. There are various environmental, economic, social, cul-
tural, legal, institutional, and technological implications for each
of these options. Retreat could lead to a loss of property, poten-
tially costly resettlement of populations, and, in some notable
cases, refugee problems. Accommodation could result in declin-
ing property values and in costs for modifying infrastructure.
Protection may require significant investment, can have envi-
ronmental costs to shorelines, and may be ineffective if the fre-
quency or magnitude of extreme events increases. Generally
speaking, building codes and other design and construction stan-
dards offer one of the most effective ways to limit the effects of
extreme events such as tropical cyclones and flooding. As the
climate changes, the standards need to be periodically revisited

"Until recently, traditional styles of clothing, buildings, and cul-
tural features such as hours of work varied considerably around
the world, mirroring the outdoor environment and each
tegion’s unique sociocultural and technical response to it
(Shove, 1994). Unique cultural response has been overtaken by
standardization in hours of work, clothing, and heating and
cooling technology, including standardized definitions of
human comfort and “ideal” indoor environments (Fanger,
1970; King, 1990; Baker, 1993). Localized culture- and situa-
tion-specific responses, such as reintroducing the “siesta” or
varying the strategy between the prestige commercial sector
(hotels, banks, and offices) and the residential sector, offer the
opportunity to have a less energy-intensive response to global
warming. Locally specific strategies will reflect the distribu-
tion of wealth and status, slowing if not reversing the trend to
globalized lifestyle and standardized indoor environment.

"The reuse of treated sewage requires advanced sewage-treat-
ment technology in addition to the more-conventional sec-
ondary treatment. There are many options in the advanced
treatment category. Depending on the proposed quality of
treated water, its cost and consumption of energy and resources
vary. Some of the advanced treatments consume much more
energy than the conventional sewage treatment processes.
Energy-intensive processes often tend to be adopted in the
developed countries so that the quality of treated water obtains
acceptance from the public. Savings in energy consumption are
important and should be taken into account in such cases. On
the other hand, inexpensive and less energy-intensive methods
are normally chosen in the developing countries. Such a choice
is desirable from the view point of the global environment, but
high priority should also be given to avoiding hygienic risk
either by using a high grade of treatment or by limiting the uses
of the treated sewage.

"Although increasing human activity and urbanization are likeli-
er to have more important impacts on sewage management than
will climate change, the impact of climate change or the neces-
sity of reduction in GHGs may influence sewage-management
policy in the direction of water recycling and reducing energy
use. Water demand will increase in many urban areas, whereas
severe reduction in available potable-water resources because
of climate change is predicted in some areas. By necessity,
reuse of treated sewage will increase to cope with relative short-
age of urban water resources. Limited reuse of sewage has been
applied in areas that are subject to dry climate (South Africa,
Israel, California, etc.) or in areas with very high density of
urban activity (e.g., Japan). These examples show that reuse of
treated sewage for flush toilets, industrial use, agricultural use,
or even part of the raw water destined for potable water supply
is technologically possible. For some uses, waterborne toxins
not addressed by conventional treatment can be a concern.

for landslide mapping and landslide risk assessment. The work
of the Geotechnical Control Office in Hong Kong (Brand,

good examples of such schemes. However, many of the poorer

"Though the extent of adaptive capacity varies among nations
and localities, human beings have developed multiple adaptive
responses over the centuries to cope with high fire-danger
regimes. Major adaptive responses include both fire prevention
and fire control and suppression; use of fireproof and fire-retar-
dant materials such as concrete and steel, rather than wood in
buildings; development of extensive firefighting networks in
settled areas (including personnel and mechanical firefighting
equipment such as fire trucks, fire-hydrant systems, and sprin-
kler systems in buildings); fire-control systems in rural areas,
such as controlled burns to limit fuel, fire breaks, aerial fire
retardant delivery, and rural fire departments and “smoke
jumpers”; and short-term activity controls during high fire-
danger weather, such as prohibitions on open burning, com-
mercial activities such as logging, and recreation activities
such as hiking, hunting, or use of off-road vehicles. If frequen-
cy or intensity of fire danger warrant, another potential adap-
tive response involves improved spatial planning of communi-
ties and some longer-term land-use controls. These provide
better isolation of fires and could limit damage to human set-
tlements. If global climate change makes high fire danger a
more common or dangerous occurrence in places such as west-
ern North America and southeastern Australia, more frequent
and intense application of these principles may reduce vulner-
abilities to fire. In locations where fire danger is lessened,
relaxation of some controls may be possible and desirable.

health and relief services’ emergency response to specific dis-
ease outbreaks, for example. Improved air-pollution control is
desirable from a number of perspectives under current climate

"Present Situation

Generally speaking, consistent, useful estimates
of infrastructure types and values, especially in
flood zones, do not really exist. Databases on
regional capital stock are necessary to calculate
infrastructure at risk from extreme events.
Information is also required on capital turnover
rates to determine “natural” replacement rates.

Better-founded information is needed to support
estimates of the effects of climate on national
energy demand, particularly the balance between
heating and cooling in temperate-zone countries,
which is currently a matter of some controversy.

"Potential changes in hydrologic balance because of climate
change will have an impact on the availability of water
resources and eventually on water balance and water supply.
However, more significant and acute imbalance between water
demand and the water resource is expected in many regions
because of the increase both in population and in per capita
water demand. Water-shortage problems exist and are becom-
ing increasingly serious even under present circumstances
(Laburn, 1993). Severe imbalances are foreseen, especially in
developing countries where water demand is increasing rapid-
ly and the institutional system and water supply facilities are
still insufficient. Future management must take into account
such socioeconomic-driven increases in water demand and the
potential decrease in available water resources. Solutions to
such imbalances include minimizing net water use and devel-
oping new water resources, including limited wastewater
reuse. Prevention of water pollution is necessary to maintain a
water quality satisfactory enough for potable water supply. See
Chapter 14 for additional details on water-management
options. The Nordic Freshwater Initiative proposed two key
principles for future sustainable development and water use in
developing countries (Jgnch-Clausen, 1993). The first princi-
ple is management at the lowest appropriate levels. Centralized
and top-down approaches to water-resource development and
management are often insufficient for efficient local manage-
ment, although the centralized mechanism is good to ensure
national economic and social interests. The second principle is
to consider water as an economic good. Numerous opportuni-
ties exist for improved management of water infrastructure,
pricing policies, and demand-side management of supply
(Frederick and Gleick, 1989). The cost includes direct cost,
opportunity cost, and environmental cost. Charging for water
use induces conservation and protection of water resources and
develops the consciousness of water management.

Cost estimates are needed for nearly every infra-

of the costs of coastal defense and some studies
on energy demand, little has been done on the
costs associated with the effects of climate
change on human settlements. There are only

infrastructure development, and the costs of

Data are needed on technology dynamics.
Beyond general principles, we know very little
about which variables govern the development
and adoption of new technologies. Yet this may
have a profound impact on the future shape of
human settlements.

We have better data and theories on population fer-

much more difficult to forecast quantitatively.
Analysis of the future location of economic activ-

current business decisions to whole industries,

"	Title
"To evaluate the direct and indirect effects of climate on yield at
the farm, regional, or higher levels requires integrated models
that consider system interactions. Issues of scale add uncer-
tainty, and higher-order models have not generally taken into
account the climatic effects on soils and pests. Despite these
limitations, climate change studies show:
"	Text
"Major conclusions of the assessment cover four areas: (1) The
direct and indirect effects of changes in climate and atmospheric
constituents on crop yield, soils, agricultural pests, and livestock;
(2) estimates of yield and production changes for specific locali-
ties, countries, and the world, based on studies that integrate mul-
tiple direct and indirect effects; (3) the conditions that determine
vulnerability and areas and populations that are relatively more
vulnerable to adverse changes; and (4) adaptation potential.
"	Text
"The results of a large number of experiments to
resolve the effect of elevated CO, concentrations on
crops have confirmed a beneficial effect. The mean
value yield response of C; crops (most crops except
maize, sugar cane, millet, and sorghum) to doubled
CO, is +30%. Measured response ranges from -10%
to +80%. Only gradually is the basis for these differ-
ences being resolved. Factors known to affect the
response include the availability of plant nutrients, the
crop species, temperature, precipitation, and other
environmental factors. Differences in experimental

"Crop yields and productivity changes will vary con-
siderably across regions. Thus, the pattern of agricul-
tural production is likely to change in a number of
regions (High Confidence).

Global agricultural production can be maintained rel-
ative to base production under climate change as
expressed by general circulation models (GCMs)
under doubled CO, equilibrium climate scenarios
(Medium Confidence).

Based on global agricultural studies using doubled
CO, equilibrium GCM scenarios, lower-latitude and
lower-income countries have been shown to be more
negatively affected. Again, crop model simulation
results vary widely, e.g., +20% changes in yield, for
specific countries and sites across studies and GCM
scenarios (Medium Confidence).
"	List
"Substantial research progress has been made on the impacts of
climate change on agriculture since the 1990 IPCC assessment,
with new studies for different sites and countries covering
many areas of the world. New studies also have been con-
ducted that integrate site, country, and regional impacts to pro-
vide information about how global agricultural production and
consumption may be affected. On the whole, these studies sup-
port the evidence presented in the first IPCC assessment that
global agricultural production can be maintained relative to
baseline production in the face of climate changes likely to
occur over the next century (i.e., in the range of 1 to 4.5°C) but
that regional effects will vary widely. Major uncertainties
result from the lack of reliable geographic resolution in future
climate predictions, difficulties in integrating and scaling-up
basic physiologic responses and relationships, and difficulty in
estimating farm sector response and adaptation to changing cli-
mate as it varies across the world. Thus, while there will be
winners and losers stemming from climate impacts on agricul-
tural production, it is not possible to distinguish reliably and
precisely those areas that will benefit and those that will lose.

"technique also are responsible for variations in the
measured response (High Confidence).

Changes in soils, e.g., loss of soil organic matter,
leaching of soil nutrients, and salinization and ero-
sion, are a likely consequence of climate change for
some soils in some climatic zones. Cropping practices
such as crop rotation, conservation tillage, and
improved nutrient management are, technically, quite
effective in combating or reversing deleterious effects
(High Confidence).

Livestock production will be affected by changes in
grain prices, changes in the prevalence and distribution
of livestock pests, and changes in grazing and pasture
productivity. Analyses indicate that intensively man-
aged livestock systems have more potential for adapta-
tion than crop systems. In contrast, adaptation may be
more problematic in pastoral systems where production
is very sensitive to climate change, technology changes
introduce new risks, and the rate of technology adop-
tion is slow (see Chapter 2) (Medium Confidence).
The risk of losses due to weeds, insects, and diseases
is likely to increase (Low Confidence).

"Vulnerability to climate change depends on physical
and biological response but also on socioeconomic
characteristics. Low-income populations depending
on isolated agricultural systems, particularly dryland
systems in semi-arid and arid regions, are particularly
vulnerable to hunger and severe hardship. Many of
these at-risk populations are found in Sub-Saharan
Africa, South and Southeast Asia, as well as some

depends on the affordability of adaptive measures,

genetic diversity for crop breeding, and topography.

likely to discourage effective adaptation and are a
source of current land degradation and resource mis-

"Experiments concerning crop performance at elevated CO,
concentrations in general show a positive but variable increase
in productivity for annual crops (Kimball, 1983; Strain and
Cure, 1985; Cure and Acock, 1986; Allen et al., 1990; Kimball
et al., 1990; Lawlor and Mitchell, 1991; Bazzaz and Fajer,

al., 1993; Mooney and Koch, 1994; Rogers et al., 1994).
Annual C, plants exhibit an increased production averaging
about 30% at doubled (700 ppm) CO, concentrations; both bio-
mass and seed production show an increase in almost all exper-
iments under controlled conditions (Cure and Acock, 1986;
Rogers and Dahlmann, 1993). Although the mean value
response (+30% for C; crops) has been confirmed, variations
in responsiveness between plant species and ecosystems persist
(from -10% to +80%), and only gradually is the basis for these
differences being resolved. Fewer experiments have been con-
ducted with perennial crops—woody species in particular—but
evidence suggests that the growth response would be less than
for annual crops; the measured response for C, crops is much
smaller than that for C; crops.

"The main climate variables important for crop plants, as for
other plants, are temperature, solar radiation, water, and
atmospheric CO, concentration. Important differences in
temperature sensitivity and response to CO, exist among C3,
C,, and CAM plants (Chapter A). While the basic physio-
logical response of crop plants are no different than other
plants of similar types, crop plants have been selected for
particular traits and grow under more highly controlled con-
ditions than plants growing in forests (managed and unman-
aged) or other ecosystems. Most crop plants are C;, the
principal C, exceptions are maize, millet, sorghum, and
sugar cane. Crop traits are selected and bred into different
varieties to produce high yields for different climate and
resource conditions. Most crop plants are grown as annuals
(e.g., grains, potatoes, and most vegetable and fiber crops)
with the crop species, variety, and planting time chosen by
the farmer at the start of each growing season. Tree fruits,
coffee, tea, cocoa, bananas, grapes, many forage and pasture
crops, and other small fruits are the principal perennials.
_Nutrients and water which may be limited under natural
conditions are more likely to be (or can be) augmented via
fertilization, irrigation, and management of crop residue.
Competition with other plants is controlled. The primary
focus of crop production is the efficient production of har-
vestable yield, usually of only one component of the plant
(e.g., seed, fruit, root, leaf).

"Climate change will affect agriculture through effects on
crops (Section 13.2); soils (Section 13.3); insects, weeds,
and diseases (Section 13.4); and livestock (Section 13.5).
Climatic conditions interact with agriculture through numer-
ous and diverse mechanisms. Mechanisms, effects, and
responses include, for example, eutrophication and acidifica-
tion of soils, the survival and distribution of pest popula-
tions, the effects of CO, concentration on tissue- and organ-
specific photosynthate allocation, crop breeding aims, ani-
mal shelter requirements, and the location of production
(Brunnert and Dammgen, 1994). Variation of agricultural
and climatic conditions across the world leads to different
local and regional impacts (Section 13.6). High levels of
uncertainty necessitate assessment of vulnerability to the
adverse effects of potential climate change (Section 13.7).
The effects of climate change on local, national, and region-
al economies and food supplies depend on future economic
and agricultural conditions and on the international trans-
mission of supply shocks through international trade
(Section 13.8). Historically, agriculture has proved to be
highly adaptive to changing conditions, but uncertainty
remains with regard to adaptation to potential climate change
(Section 13.9). Emission-control efforts also will likely
affect agriculture (Chapter 23), as will competition for land
and water resources from other sectors affected by climate
change (Chapter 25).

"Variations in the growth enhancement among crops and differ-
ent varieties of the same crop and over years are high, and inter-
actions with nutrient and water availability are complex (e.g.,
Goudriaan and De Ruiter, 1983; Chaudhuri et al., 1986;
Mitchell et al., 1993). The extent and occurrence of physiolog-
ical adaptations of the photosynthetic apparatus, particularly of
perennial plants, to long-term exposure to high CO, concentra-
tions—which is more directly relevant to long-term climate
change—are still unresolved (Cure and Acock, 1986; Bazzaz
and Fajer, 1992; Wolfe and Erickson, 1993). Plants with nitro-
gen-fixing symbionts (e.g., peas, beans, alfalfa), under favor-
able environmental conditions for both symbiont and plant, tend
to benefit more from enhanced CO, supplies than do other
plants (Cure et al., 1988). The content of nonstructural carbo-
hydrates generally increases under high CO), while the concen-
trations of mineral nutrients and proteins are reduced (Mooney
and Koch, 1994; Rogers et al., 1994; Koerner and Miglietta, in
press). Root/shoot ratios often increase under elevated CO, lev-
els favoring root crops and also contribute to soil organic mat-
ter build-up (Mauney ef al., 1992; Mitchell et al., 1993). Crop
plants, like other plants, show increased water use efficiency
under elevated CO, levels, but water consumption on a ground-
area basis vs. a leaf-area basis is much less affected. Water use
on a ground-area basis can actually increase if leaf area
(canopy) increases. The range of water-use efficiencies among
varieties for major crops is wide (e.g., Cure and Acock, 1986;
Kimball et al., 1993; Sombroek and Gommes, 1993), providing
the opportunity to breed or select for improved efficiency. At
higher CO, levels, plant growth damage done by air pollutants
like nitrogen oxide (NO,), sulfur dioxide (SO,), and ozone (O3)
is reduced because of partial stomatal closing and other physio-
logical changes (Van de Geijn et ai., 1993).

vantages (Krupa and Kickert, 1989). Year-to-year variations in
response also occur because of varying weather conditions that
more or less favor CO, response of crops. The most widely
used experimental system is the open-top chamber. Free-air
CO, enrichment (FACE) experiments are more expensive but
attempt to create conditions close to those likely to be experi-
enced in an open field. Initial results from these experiments
confirm the basic positive response of crops to elevated CO),
but studies have been conducted only for a few crops (Mauney
et al., 1992). In addition, even the FACE experimental set-up
creates a modified area (Kimball et al., 1993; Vugts, 1993)
analogous to a single irrigated field within a dry environment.

"crops a nighttime temperature of 10 to 20°C is optimal. C, and
CAM crops require a minimum temperature of 10 to 15°C for
growth and are relatively sensitive to frost. The minimum tem-
perature for C, crops ranges from 5 to 10°C; C, crops exhibit
variable frost sensitivity. Cumulative temperature above mini-
mum growing temperature is an important determinant of crop
phenological development. For annual crops, warmer tempera-
tures speed development, shortening the period of growth and
lowering yield if shortened growth period is not fully compen-
sated by more rapid development at the higher temperature
Ellis et al., 1990). The amount of light received during the
reproductive stage may determine whether yields fall (Acock
and Acock, 1993).

"Temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, wind, and pre-
cipitation vary not only over the season and year but on a daily
basis. The effects of variability can be both positive and nega-
tive depending on the crop and the nature of the variability.
Cool-season vegetable crops (e.g., spinach, cauliflower, broc-
coli) perform best when nights are cool; their quality deterio-
rates under warmer temperatures. Apples, pears, cherries, and
many other tree fruits require winter chilling periods for buds
to set but can suffer near-total loss of the fruit crop if late frosts
damage the blossoms. Alternate thawing and freezing of the
ground can cause the loss of perennial forage crops such as
alfalfa. Extreme climatic events (e.g., storms with high winds,
flooding, heavy rains, hail, hard late or early frosts) can be
responsible for severe or total crop loss.

"Climate affects most major soil processes and is a major factor
in soil formation; the potential effects of changing climate and
higher atmospheric CO, on soils are highly interactive and
complex (Bouwman, 1990; Buol et al., 1990). Many of the
world’s soils are potentially vulnerable to soil degradation
(e.g., loss of soil organic matter, leaching of soil nutrients,
salinization, and erosion) as a likely consequence of climate
change (see Chapter 4).

"Climatic and other factors strongly interact to affect crop yields. Models have provided an important means for integrat-
ing many different factors that affect crop yield over the season (Rotter, 1993). Scaling up results from detailed under-
standing of leaf and plant response to climate and other environmental stresses to estimate yield changes for whole farms
and regions, however, can present many difficulties (e.g., Woodward, 1993).

"Higher-level, integrated models typically accommodate only first-order effects and reflect more complicated processes
with technical coefficients. Mechanistic crop growth models take into account (mostly) local limitations in resource
availability (e.g., water, nutrients) but not other considerations that depend on social and economic response, such as soil
preparation and field operations, management of pests, and irrigation.

"Incorporation of the multiple effects of CO, in models has generally been incomplete. Some do not include any CO,
effects and thus may overestimate negative consequences of CO,-induced changes in climate. Other models consider
only a crude yield effect. More detailed models consider CO, effects on water use efficiency (e.g., Wang et al., 1992;
Leuning et al., 1993). With few exceptions, most models fail to consider CO, interactions with temperature and effects

on reproductive growth (Wang and Gifford, 1995).

"Farther integration of models of crop yield, phenology, and water use with geographic-scale agroclimatic models of crop
distribution and economic response has also occurred (e.g., Kaiser et al., 1993; Kenny et al., 1993; Rétter and van Diepen,
1994). Simplified representations of crop response have been used with climate and soil data that are available on a global
basis (Leemans and Solomon, 1993). More aggregated statistical models have been used to estimate the combined physical
and socioeconomic response of the farm sector (Mendelsohn ef al., 1994; Darwin et al., 1995).

changed climate conditions (see Easterling et al., 1992; Rosenzweig and Iglesias, 1994); in cases of severe stress, relia-

isons of wheat models have shown that even though basic responses were correctly represented, the quantitative outcome
between models varied greatly. Validation of models has been an important goal (Olesen and Grevsen, 1993; Semenov et

land degradation (Brinkman and Sombroek, 1993; Rasmussen

(1993) found that, in most cases, changes in soils by direct
human action, whether intentional or unintended, are likely to

increased intensity of rainfall, which may result in increased

90% of per capita food supplies worldwide, 80 are C; plants

"Climate change will affect the distribution and degree of infes-
tation of insect pests through both direct effects on the life
cycle of insects and indirectly through climatic effects on
hosts, predators, competitors, and insect pathogens. There is
some evidence that the risk of crop loss will increase due to
poleward expansion of insect ranges. Insect populations faced
with modified and unstable habitats created under annual
arable agricultural systems generally must diapause (enter a
state of dormancy), migrate, otherwise adapt genetically, or
die. Insect species characterized by high reproduction rates are
generally favored (Southwood and Comins, 1976). Human

1990), might interfere with herbicide activity. CO, enrichment
also increases the growth of rhizomes and tubers in C, plants
(Oechel and Strain, 1985), which could reduce the effective-
ness of chemical and mechanical control of deep-rooting,
perennial C, weeds. On the other hand, increased temperatures
and increased metabolic activity tend to increase uptake,
translocation, and effectiveness of many herbicides. Natural
and biological control of weeds and other pests depends on the
synchrony between the growth, development, and reproduc-
tion of biocontrol agents and their targets. Such synchrony
may be disrupted if climate changes rapidly, particularly if cli-
matic extremes occur more frequently. Global warming could
facilitate overwintering of insect populations and favor earlier
poleward migrations in the spring, which could increase the
effectiveness of biological control of weeds in some cases.
Conversely, such enhanced over-winterings would accelerate
the spread of viruses by migrating vectors like aphids.

"Insect life cycle processes affected by climate and weather
include lifespan duration, fecundity, diapause, dispersal, mor-

lowing effects of temperature on insects: limiting geographical
ranges; over-wintering; population growth rates; number of
generations per annum; length of growing season; crop-pest
synchronization; interspecific interactions; dispersal and
migration; and availability of host plants and refugia. The
effects of climate and weather on insect life cycles have been
documented for a wide variety of insect pests of agriculture,
rangelands, and forests (Dobzhansky, 1965; Fye and McAda,

outbreaks following extreme weather events (on the order of
hours to weeks). Freezing temperatures are a major factor in
mortality, but Drosophila sp. insects that survive relatively
colder temperatures have been found to be more fecund than
cohorts that were not exposed to the low temperatures

Sutherst (1990, 1991), and Sutherst et al. (1995). They demon-
strate that impacts could be severe in many different environ-

Principal concern is with species that can increase their popu-
lation size by undergoing an extra generation each year in
warmer climates or expand their geographical distributions.
For example, Porter et al. (1991) found that in Europe O. nubi-
Jalis would shift 1220 km northward if temperature increased
by 3° to 6°C by 2025-2070. For a 3°C temperature increase in
Japan, Mochida (1991) predicted expanded ranges for tobacco
cut worm (Spodoptera litura), southern green stink bug

lima-bean pod borer (Etiella zinckenella), common green stink
bug (Nezera antennata), soybean stem gall (Asphondylia sp.),

conditions affect the survival, growth, and spread of pathogens,

important plant diseases. Among these, mild winters have been
associated with more rapid and stronger outbreaks of powdery
mildew (Erysiphe grammis), brown leaf rust of barley
(Puccinia hordei), and strip rust of cereals (Puccinia stri-
iformis) (Meier, 1985). Mild winters combined with very warm
weather conditions provide optimal growth conditions for cer-
cosporea leaf spot disease (Cercosporea beticola), powdery
mildew (Erysiphe betae), and rhizomania disease (Rizomania)

stronger outbreaks of late potato blight (Phytophthora infes-

because plant resistance is increased. Summer dryness, partic-

summer precipitation, particularly heavy storms, would

been devoted to studying agricultural effects on countries of
the Middle East. The available studies for sub-Saharan Africa
suggest that critical thresholds are related to precipitation and
the length of the growing season, although warmer tempera-
tures and increased radiation may benefit highland areas.
National and local assessments providing a detailed under-
standing of crop-specific responses and regional impacts are
still lacking.

"Recent studies (Ominde and Juma, 1991; Ottichilo et al., 1991;
Downing, 1992; Schulze et al., 1993; Sivakumar, 1993;
Magadza, 1994) indicate that most of Africa will be sensitive
to climate change, although some regions may benefit from
warmer and wetter conditions (Table 13-4). Downing (1992),
in analyses for Kenya, Zimbabwe, and Senegal, evaluated the
sensitivity to incremental climatic variations suggested by
GCM scenarios for the region. Nationally, he estimated that
potential food production in Kenya would increase, particularly
if rainfall increases, but that the impacts would vary regionally;
sub-humid and semi-arid provinces supporting socioeco-
nomically vulnerable groups would be negatively affected
even with increases in national food production potential.

"Variation of agriculture systems, climates, resources, and
economic characteristics across and within countries may be
more important in determining the effects of climate change
than differences in climate scenarios themselves. Agricultural
policy is an important consideration in most regions.
Agricultural policies have had many and changing goals.
Climate change is generally not among top policy priorities
for agricultural policymakers, but climate change could affect
the cost and likelihood of achieving other policy priorities—
such as food adequacy and reduction of chronic hunger,
improving export competitiveness, assuring regional and

warming would be beneficial, with increasing yield due to
diversification of cropping systems. However, they estimated
that by 2050, when they expect an average warming for China

increases in precipitation, thus leading to a greater likelihood of
yield loss due to water stress for some rice-growing areas, even
as the area suitable for rice increases.

"For China, warming would likely cause a general northward
movement of agroclimatic regions, with certain exceptions in the
south where the moisture deficit may increase even more than in
the north. The general possibility of increased summer dryness in
the continental mid-latitudes suggests the following six areas as
most likely to be negatively affected by climate change (Lin Erda,
1994): the area around the Great Wall lying southeast of the tran-
sition belt between crop agriculture and animal husbandry; the
Huang-Hai Plains where dryland crops like wheat, cotton, corn,
and fruit trees are grown; the area north of Huai River including
Eastern Shandong that lies along the south edge of the south tem-
perate zone; the central and southern areas of Yunnan Plateau;
middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River; and the Loess
Plateau. In general, these areas would be at heightened risk of
drought and would suffer potential increases in soil erosion. The
Yunnan Plateau, with generally abundant rainfall, is subject to
alternating droughts and waterlogging; production is sensitive to
changes that would increase the variability of climate.

"Studies of New Zealand agriculture considered the main
effects of climate change on New Zealand’s important pas-
toral agriculture to be: (1) a poleward spread of subtropical
pastures, (2) a resultant decrease in the area of temperate pas-
ture, (3) higher yields, (4) altered seasonality of production,
(5) spread of growth to higher elevations, and (6) decreased
growth in the eastern areas of the North Island due to drier
and warmer conditions (Ministry for the Environment, 1990;
Salinger and Hicks, 1990; Martin et al., 1991). Models to pre-
dict effects on forage production systems are currently being
developed and validated. Initial modeling simulations of the
effects of doubled-CO, climates on pasture yield including
the beneficial effects of CO, varied from +10 to +77% (Korte
et al., 1991; Butler et al., 1991; Martin et al., 1991). The
higher figures, however, likely overestimated the beneficial
effects of CO, (Campbell, 1994). More recent work

gains of up to 15%.

"Studies for Japan (Table 13-6) indicate that the positive effects
of CO, on rice yields would generally more than offset nega-

to yield gains; in the southwest, particularly in Kyushu, the rice
yield effects were, on balance, estimated to be negative for sev-
eral climate scenarios (Seino, 1993a, 1993b). Horie (1987)
found generally negative effects on rice yield in Hokkaido
under the GISS climate scenario when rice variety was not
changed but found increased yields if longer maturing varieties
were adopted. Horie (1991), under the Oregon State University
(OSU) climate scenario, found that rice yields would fall in
most areas of the country but that changes in rice variety and
other management changes could recover most losses except in
the southwest, where the projected increase in temperature of
4.0-4.5°C exceeded the temperature tolerances of japonica rice
varieties. Additional considerations for Japanese agriculture
are possible changes in flowering and maturation of fruit trees,
with potential northward shifts in cultivated areas and changed
distribution of insect pests (Seino, 1993a).

spiration (PET) (Le Houerou, 1994; Rowntree, 1990), finding
that under higher temperatures the crop growing season would
be extended for grain crops, assuming an increase in the num-
ber of frost-free days. For southern Europe, the extension of
the growing season would likely be insufficient to avoid high
summer temperatures by planting earlier. Thus, reduced grain
filling period and lower yields are likely. Other studies have
explored how the climatically limited range for crops, includ-
ing maize, wheat, cauliflower, and grapes, would change under
various GCMs and other climate scenarios (Carter et al.,
1991a, 1991b; Parry er al., 1992; Kenny ef al., 1993; Kenny
and Harrison, 1993; Wolf, 1993a, 1993b). In general, these
studies found a northward shift of crop-growing zones with
potential for grain maize to be grown as far north as the UK
and central Finland. Increased demand for irrigation and/or
increased areas likely to suffer from water deficits, particular-
ly in southern Europe, also were found.

agricultural commodity prices could more than offset farm

approach to directly estimate the impact of climate change on
agricultural revenue and asset values. This approach more fully

relatively low. These areas are important for world food pro-

Mediterranean area of Europe, and large areas of Australia are

change reduced moisture availability or increased the demand

water inundation and salt water intrusion are not unique to small
island nations. However, these problems take on greater impor-
tance where coastal area is a high proportion of the total area of

the area available for retreat from sea-level rise is limited. Local
sources of food are especially important for these countries

"Latin America and countries that now make up the area that
was formerly the USSR are similar in terms of per capita GNP.
While data are unavailable with regard to economic perfor-

suggests that the region suffered a decline in per capita GNP
over the past decade, as has Latin America. The two regions
are also similar in that average population density and popu-
lation per hectare of cropland are moderate to low. Estimates
of potential additional cropland for the world suggest that
these two areas could be the source of substantial additional
cropland (Crosson, 1995). Thus, expansion of land area or
relocation to adapt to climate change is a possible response,
partly mitigating vulnerability. The prevalence of childhood
malnutrition, infant mortality, and low median age at death are
somewhat higher in Latin America than in the area of the for-
mer USSR (World Bank, 1993). While both regions are pri-
marily humid, substantial agricultural areas are arid or semi-
arid and drought-prone. The notable difference between the
two regions is that Latin America is generally already tropical
or subtropical, and even though GCMs predict less warming
in the tropics, further warming may be deleterious. In contrast,
agriculture in large areas of the former USSR is limited by
cool temperatures and so may benefit from warming. Arid

Others are less optimistic, citing limits on further land expan-

"Thus, food supply growth could slow by 40-50% from recent
decades while maintaining per capita food production levels.
Income growth likely will cause demand to grow more rapidly
than population and will change the composition of demand,
most likely away from food grains and toward meat, fruits, and
vegetables. The shift to meat is likely to increase the demand for
grain for livestock feed. Increased demand generated by
increased income growth would allow more and higher-quality
food to be consumed per capita (Mitchell and Ingco, 1995), but
this depends on how food consumption is distributed. Beyond

"Irrigation has contributed significantly to increased production
in the past..Currently, 17% of global cropland is irrigated, but
this 17% of land accounts for more than one-third of total
world food production. An estimated additional 137 million
hectares have the potential to be irrigated, compared with the
253 million hectares currently irrigated (World Bank, 1990),
but the cost of doing so may be prohibitive. Current water sys-
tems in many developing countries achieve low efficiencies of
water distribution, and average crop yields are well below
potential (Yudelman, 1993; Crosson, 1995; Rosegrant and
Agcaoili, 1995), There are environmental and health-related
effects of irrigation such as soil salinization and the spread of
water-borne diseases that may limit further expansion (Brown
and Thomas, 1990; Dregne and Chou, 1990; Jensen et al.,
1990; Crosson, 1995). Major factors contributing to these irri-

"Some estimates suggest that there is much potentially available
land (Buringh and Dudal, 1987), but the cost of bringing it under
production may be high, with attendant adverse environmental
impacts limiting expansion (Crosson, 1995). Intensification of
production on existing cropland may worsen land degradation
and put additional pressure on water and soil resources. Firm
data on the extent and severity of land degradation and its impact
on production potential for most of the world are not available
(El-Swaify et al., 1982; Dregne, 1988; Nelson, 1988; Lal and
Okigbo, 1990), but a recent overview (Oldeman et al., 1990),
though still qualitative in economic terms, confirms significant
degradation and loss of arable land, especially in Africa (see
Chapter 4). Studies disagree on the extent to which intensifica-
tion affects land degradation (Crosson and Stout, 1983; Brown
and Thomas, 1990; Tiffen et al., 1993), Competition for agricul-
tural resources for other uses may also affect the supply and
price of land for agriculture. Carbon sequestration, biomass
energy production, forest product production, the potential
development of new non-food agricultural products, and
removal of agricultural land from production for other environ-
mental objectives will affect the amount of land available for
food production (see Chapters 23, 24, and 25).

under climate change scenarios ranging from 2.5 to 5.2°C. The
study further found that the population at risk of hunger
(defined as a measure of food energy availability, which
depends on income and food price levels, relative to nutrition-
al requirements) could increase despite adaptation. The study
involved agricultural scientists in 18 countries using compara-
ble crop growth models for wheat, rice, maize, and soybean
(IBSNAT, 1989) and consistent climate change scenarios
(Rosenzweig and Iglesias, 1994). Estimated yield changes
were the basis for supply changes in the Basic Linked System

"The impact of climate change on human populations in terms

how and whether currently poor areas develop over the next 20

nerable countries remains uncertain. Policy failures, wars, and
political and civil unrest are identified causes, but correcting
these problems has proved difficult (e.g., van Dijk, 1992;
Anand and Ravallion, 1993). Lagging agricultural develop-

cy distortions in many developing countries, conflicting with
the industrial sector and limiting the ability of the broader

"Table 13-14 also illustrates how trade and adaptation capabili-
ty can interact. Developing countries’ production levels fell
more under adaptation level 1 (small changes in planting dates,
changes in cultivars, and additional irrigation water for areas
already irrigated) than with no adaptation because their esti-
mated capability to adapt was less than in developed countries.
Thus, cereal production in developing countries fell further as
trade shifted toward developed-country exports at the expense
of developing country production. At adaptation level 2 (sub-
stantial changes in planting dates, changes in crop, and exten-
sion of irrigation systems), this situation was reversed.

"Historically, farming systems have adapted to changing
economic conditions, technology, and resource availabili-
ties and have kept pace with a growing population
(Rosenberg, 1982; CAST, 1992). Evidence exists that agri-
cultural innovation responds to economic incentives such
as factor prices and can relocate geographically (Hyami
and Ruttan, 1985; CAST, 1992). A number of studies indi-
cate that adaptation and adjustment will be important to
limit losses or to take advantage of improving climatic con-
ditions (e.g., National Academy of Sciences, 1991;
Rosenberg, 1992; Rosenberg and Crosson, 1991; CAST,

"Despite the successful historical record, questions arise with
regard to whether the rate of change of climate and required
adaptation would add significantly to the disruption likely
due to future changes in economic conditions, technology
and resource availabilities (Gommes, 1993; Harvey, 1993;
Kane and Reilly, 1993; Smit, 1993; Norse, 1994; Pittock,
1994; Reilly, 1994). If climate change is gradual, it may be a
small factor that goes unnoticed by most farmers as they
adjust to other more profound changes in agriculture stem-
ming from new technology, increasing demand for food, and
other environmental concerns such as pesticide use, water
quality, and land preservation, However, some researchers
see climate change as a significant addition to future stress-
es, where adapting to yet another stress such as climate
change may be beyond the capability of the system. Part of
the divergence in views may be due to different interpreta-
tions of adaptation, which include the prevention of loss, tol-
erating loss, or relocating to avoid loss (Smit, 1993).
Moreover, while the technological potential to adapt may
exist, the socioeconomic capability to adapt likely differs for
different types of agricultural systems (Reilly and Hohmann,
1993).

"irrigation is costly and subject to the availability of
water supplies. Climate change will affect future
water supplies (see Chapter 10). There is wide scope
for enhancing irrigation efficiency through adoption
of drip irrigation systems and other water-conserving
technologies (FAO, 1989, 1990), but successful adop-
tion will require substantial changes in how irrigation
systems are managed and how water resources are
priced. Because inadequate water systems are respon-
sible for current problems of land degradation, and
because competition for water is likely to increase,
there likely will be a need for changes in the manage-
ment and pricing of water regardless of whether and
how climate changes (Vaux, 1990, 1991; World Bank,
1994), Tillage method and incorporation of crop
residues are other means of increasing the useful
water supply for cropping.

Other Inputs and Management Adjustments—
Added nitrogen and other fertilizers would likely be
necessary to take full advantage of the CO, effect.
Where high levels of nitrogen are applied, nitrogen
not used by the crop may be leached into the ground-
water, run off into surface water, or be released from
the soil as nitrous oxide. Additional nitrogen in
ground and surface water has been linked to health
effects in humans and affects aquatic ecosystems.
Studies also have considered a wider range of adjust-
ments in tillage, grain drying, and other field opera-
tions (Kaiser et al., 1993; Smit, 1993).
Tillage—Minimum and reduced tillage technologies,
in combination with planting of cover crops and green
manure crops, offer substantial possibilities to reverse
existing soil organic matter, soil erosion, and nutrient
loss, and to combat potential further losses due to cli-
mate change (Rasmussen and Collins, 1991; Logan,
1991; Edwards et al., 1992; Langdale et al., 1992;
Peterson et al., 1993; Brinkman and Sombroek, 1993;
see also Chapter 23). Reduced and minimum tillage
techniques have spread widely in some countries but
are more limited in other regions. There is consider-
able current interest in transferring these techniques to
other regions (Cameron and Oram, 1994).

Improved Short-Term Climate Prediction—
Linking agricultural management to seasonal climate
predictions (currently largely based on ENSO), where
such predictions can be made with reliability, can
allow management to adapt incrementally to climate
change. Management/climate predictor links are an
important and growing part of agricultural extension
in both developed and developing countries (McKeon
et al., 1990, 1993; Nichols and Wong, 1990).
"	List
"Seasonal Changes and Sowing Dates—For frost-
limited growing areas (i.e., temperate and cold areas),
warming could extend the season, allowing planting
of longer maturity annual varieties that achieve high-
er yields (e.g., Le Houerou, 1994; Rowntree, 1990).
For short-season crops such as wheat, rice, barley,
oats, and many vegetable crops, extension of the
growing season may allow more crops per year, fall
planting, or, where warming leads to regular summer
highs above critical thresholds, a split season with a
short summer fallow. For subtropical and tropical
areas where growing season is limited by precipita-
tion or where the cropping already occurs throughout
the year, the ability to extend the growing season may
be more limited and depends on how precipitation
patterns change. A study for Thailand found yield
losses in the warmer season partially offset by gains
in the cooler season (Parry et al., 1992).

Different Crop Variety or Species—For most major
crops, varieties exist with a wide range of maturities
and climatic tolerances. For example, Matthews et al.
(1994) identified wide genetic variability among rice
varieties as a reasonably easy response to spikelet
sterility in rice that occurred in simulations for South
and Southeast Asia. Studies in Australia showed that
responses to climate change are strongly cultivar-
dependent (Wang et al., 1992). Longer-season culti-
vars were shown to provide a steadier yield under
more variable conditions (Connor and Wang, 1993).
In general, such changes may lead to higher yields or
may only partly offset losses in yields or profitability.
Crop diversification in Canada (Cohen et al., 1992)
and in China (Hulme e¢ al., 1992) has been identified
as an adaptive response.

New Crop Varieties—The genetic base is broad for
most crops but limited for some (e.g., kiwi fruit), A
study by Easterling et al. (1993) explored how hypo-
thetical new varieties would respond to climate
change (also reported in McKenney et al., 1992).
Heat, drought, and pest resistance; salt tolerance; and
general improvements in crop yield and quality would
be beneficial (Smit, 1993). Genetic engineering and
gene mapping offer the potential for introducing a
wider range of traits. Difficulty in assuring that traits
are efficaciously expressed in the full plant, consumer
concerns, profitability, and regulatory hurdles have
slowed the introduction of genetically engineered
varieties compared with early estimates (Reilly, 1989;
Caswell et al., 1994).

studies, irrigated agriculture in general is less nega-

"One measure of the potential for adaptation is to consider the
historical record on past speeds of adoption of new technolo-
gies (Table 13-16). Adoption of new or different technologies
depends on many factors: economic incentives, varying resource
and climatic conditions, the existence of other technologies (e.g.,
transportation systems and markets), the availability of informa-
tion, and the remaining economic life of equipment and struc-
tures (e.g., dams and water supply systems).
"	List
"Specific technologies only can provide a successful adaptive
response if they are adopted in appropriate situations. A variety
of issues has been considered, including land-use planning,
watershed management, disaster vulnerability assessment, port
and rail adequacy, trade policy, and the various programs coun-
tries use to encourage or control production, limit food prices,
and.manage resource inputs to agriculture (CAST, 1992; OTA,
1993; Smit, 1993; Reilly et al., 1994; Singh, 1994). For exam-
ple, studies suggest that current agricultural institutions and
policies in the United States may discourage farm management
adaptation strategies, such as altering crop mix, by supporting
prices of crops not well-suited to a changing climate, providing
disaster payments when crops fail, or prohibiting imports
through import quotas (Lewandrowski and Brazee, 1993).

"Baethgen (1994) found that a better selection of wheat variety
combined with an improved fertilizer regime could double
yields achieved at a site in Uruguay to 6 T/ha under the cur-
rent climate with current management practices. Under the
UKMO climate scenario, yields fell to 5 T/ha—still well
above 2.5-3.0 T/ha currently achieved by farmers in the area.
On the other hand, Singh (1994) concludes that the normal
need to plan for storms and extreme weather events in Pacific
island nations creates significant resiliency. Whether tech-
nologies meet the self-described needs of peasant farmers is
critical in their adaptation (Caceres, 1993), Other studies doc-
ument how individuals cope with environmental disasters,
identifying how strongly political, economic, and ethnic fac-
tors interact to facilitate or prevent coping in cases ranging
from the Dust Bow! disaster in the United States to floods in
Bangladesh to famines in the Sudan, Ethiopia, and
Mozambique (McGregor, 1994), These considerations indi-

potential adaptations that fit changing conditions (COSEPUP,
1992). Important strategies for improving the ability of agri-
culture to respond to diverse demands and pressures, drawn
from past efforts to transfer technology and provide assistance

Strategies that are effective in dealing with current

Agricultural research centers and experiment stations
can examine the “robustness” of present farming sys-
tems (i.e., their resilience to extremes of heat, cold,
frost, water shortage, pest damage, and other factors)
and test the robustness of new farming strategies as
they are developed to meet changes in climate, tech-

Interactive communication that brings research results
to farmers—and farmers’ problems, perspectives, and
successes to researchers—is an essential part of the
agricultural research system.

Agricultural research provides a foundation for adap-

relative to projected climate change. Preservation and
effective use of this genetic material would provide the
basis for new variety development. Continually chang-
ing climate is likely to increase the value of networks
of experiment stations that can share genetic material
and research results.

"There are reasons for water resources managers, especially in
developing nations, to be concerned by the results of climate-
change scenarios, which show that the freshwater resources in
many regions of the world are likely to be significantly affect-
ed. In particular, current arid and semi-arid areas of the world
could experience large decreases in runoff—hence posing a
great challenge to water resources management. Global-
change-induced perturbations may follow widespread periodic
and chronic shortfalls in those same areas caused by population
growth, urbanization, agricultural expansion, and industrial

"Water management is a continuously adaptive enterprise,
responding to changes in demands, hydrological information,
technologies, the structure of the economy, and society’s per-
spectives on the economy and the environment. This adapta-
tion employs four broad interrelated approaches: new invest-
ments for capacity expansion; operation of existing systems for
optimal use (instream and offstream); maintenance and reha-
bilitation of systems; and modifications in processes and
demands (e.g., conservation, pricing, and institutions). These
water management practices, which are intended to serve the
present range of climate variability (which in itself is consider-
able), may also serve to ameliorate the range of perturbations
such as droughts that are expected to accompany climate
change. However, adaptations come at some social, economic,
and environmental costs.

"Water availability is an essential component of welfare and
productivity. Much of the world’s agriculture, hydroelectric
power production, municipal and industrial water needs, water
pollution control, and inland navigation is dependent on the
natural endowment of surface and groundwater resources.
Changes in the natural system availability would result in
impacts that generally are greatest in regions that are already
under stress, including currently arid and semi-arid areas, as
well as areas where there is considerable competition among
users. The purpose of water resources management is to ame-
liorate the effects of extremes in climate variability and pro-
vide a reliable source of water for multiple societal purposes.
This evaluation of climate-change impacts focuses on the
expected range of changes in the hydrological resources base
and the sensitivity of the water supply and water demand com-
ponents of the water management systems to climate change.
It also makes an assessment of the viability of adaptive water
management measures in responding to these impacts.

"Hence, predicting where water resources problems due to cli-
mate change will occur can only be realized on a subconti-
nental scale at this time. However, water management deci-
sions are made on the localized, watershed scale. Therefore,
despite increases in the number of impact assessments and
improvements in the new class of transient GCMs, there is lit-
tle that can be added to the conclusions of the first two IPCC
reports on the subject, other than to note the regions and coun-
tries most likely to be vulnerable through a combination of
increased demands and reductions in available supplies.
However, one important addition is the limited but growing
analyses of water systems in the developing world. These lim-
ited studies seem to suggest that developing countries are
highly vulnerable to climate change because many are located
in arid and semi-arid regions and most existing water
resources systems in these countries are characterized as iso-
lated reservoir systems. Also, there is more evidence that
flooding is likely to become a larger problem in many tem-
perate regions, requiring adaptations not only to droughts and
chronic water shortages but also to floods and associated dam-

Water demand for irrigated agriculture is very sensi-

The current generation of transient GCMs, though much
improved, does not offer the degree of watershed-specif-

"There are many different types of water supply systems in
operation in the world. The simplest “system” extracts water
from a local stream or village borehole; this is characteristic for
most of the developing world and rural areas in many devel-
oped countries. Such supply systems, with no storage, are
potentially very sensitive to climate change. The next system
level consists of a single managed source—which may be a
river, reservoir, or aquifer—coupled with a distribution net-
work to provide water to users and possibly also to treat wastes
and return effluents to the river. The sensitivity of such a sys-
tem to climate change will depend on its characteristics—for
example, on the storage-to-runoff ratio and on the seasonal dis-
tribution of water supply and demand. The most sophisticated
systems are integrated networks, comprising several sources
and possibly involving the transfer of water over large dis-
tances. Such systems usually are found only in developed
countries; their sensitivity to climate change will depend on
system structure and the degree of utilization.

"Water resources are an important aspect of the world’s social,
economic, and ecological systems. Agriculture, hydroelectric
power production, municipal and industrial water demands,
water pollution control, and inland navigation are all dependent
on the natural endowment of surface and groundwater resources.
Civilizations have flourished and fallen as a consequence of
regional climatic changes, and many “hydraulic civilizations”
were formed around the need to control river flow. This endow-
ment is not evenly distributed spatially or temporally. With the
imbalance of water supply and demand, many nations are in
water-scarce situations and face water crises at a local level.
From 1940 to 1987, global water withdrawals increased 210%,
while the world’s population increased by 117% (Gleick, 1993;
Shiklomanov, 1993). A global water resources assessment for
the year 2025 (Strzepek et al., 1995) suggests that for the United
Nations median population forecast of 8.5 billion (a 55%
increase over 1990) and a globally balanced economic growth
path, global water use may increase by 70%.

in 2025 under population and economic growth makes assess-

Changes in hydrological processes are discussed in Chapter 10.
This chapter examines the impact on water supply and use and
evaluates possible water management response strategies.
Water resources management is the interaction of technology,
economics, and institutions for the purpose of balancing water
supply with water demand and coping with hazards associated
with hydrological extremes. The goal of this chapter is to pro-
vide an understanding of the sensitivity of the components of
water resources systems to potential climate change. Because
the water management process occurs at local and regional lev-

tinental impacts of climate change; however, it will glean from
available literature the sensitivities of various water systems to
increases and decreases in river runoff and examine changes in
water demands due to changes in regional climate. Because
changes in water use will affect many sectors of society and the
economy, other chapters in this volume are referenced, such as
those addressing wetlands, coastal zones and small islands,
energy supply, transportation, human settlements, agriculture
and forestry, fisheries, health problems, and financial services.

"Obviously, changes in river runoff will affect the yields of both
direct river abstractions and reservoir-based supply systems,
and changes in groundwater recharge will affect groundwater
yield. Changes in water quality will affect the amount of suit-

two potential effects. First, there is a risk of saline intrusion
into coastal aquifers, contaminating the water supply. This is a
major potential threat—particularly to small, low-lying
islands, whose main source of water frequently is a shallow
lens of freshwater lying just a few meters above sea level (see
Chapter 9). Second, a rise in sea level would mean that saltwa-
ter could penetrate further upstream into an estuary, perhaps
threatening low-lying freshwater intake works. The effects of
these changes in the amount of water available on water uses—
and hence on system risk and reliability--will be influenced by
changes in demands.

entities also may wish to explicitly or implicitly reconsider the
level of service delivered. Institutional adaptation—consisting
of changes in organizations, laws, regulations, and tax codes—
may be the most effective means for aligning water demands
with available supplies (Frederick, 1993; Rogers and Lydon,
1994; World Bank, 1994). This situation is a reality for man-
aged water systems but less so for unmanaged systems (€.g.,
wetlands) dependent entirely on river flow, groundwater level,
or precipitation. Water managers in developing countries are
facing population growth-driven increases in water demands,
and these demands are met primarily by increasing the water
supply via capital-intensive investments to develop infrastruc-
ture. With planning and construction times of 20 to 30 years or
more for major water projects, the question asked by many
water resources managers in developing countries (Riebsame

new water resource infrastructure.

"Climate change is likely to have an impact on both the supply
of and demands for water. This section focuses on the supply
of water, looking at the river catchment scale, the global and
regional context, and water quality; Section 14.3 considers
impacts on demands. Most climate-change impact studies
have taken the form of sensitivity analyses by feeding climate-
change scenarios into hydrological models. The outputs of
these studies tend to be expressed in terms of changes in the
reliable yield of the systems, changes in the volume of water
that can be supplied, or changes in the risk of system failure.
Virtually all of the studies have simulated what would happen
in the absence of adaptation to change. In practice, however,
water management authorities will adapt using existing or
new management options—as shown to be feasible in the
Great Lakes region by Chao et al. (1994) and Hobbs et al.
(1995)—although such adaptation may incur added costs and
involve tradeoffs that result in reductions in service for some
water users. Only a few studies (Riebsame er al., 1995;
Strzepek et al., 1995) have considered factors other than cli-
mate change that might affect water resources over the next
few decades, such as population growth, economic develop-

"Studies that have considered possible changes in water supply
in specific areas fall into three groups. The first group of stud-
ies infers changes in potential supply directly from modeled
changes in annual and monthly water balance. Problems in
maintaining summer supplies from direct river abstractions
may be inferred, for example, if summer river flows are pro-
jected to decline (Amell and Reynard, 1993). The second
group of research has considered the sensitivity of hypothetical
supply systems—usually single reservoirs—to changes in
inputs. The third group of studies has largely been conducted
since IPCC’s 1992 Supplementary Report and consists of
investigations into specific water-supply systems. Some have
looked at individual reservoirs or groundwater resource sys-
tems; others have examined entire integrated water-supply sys-
tems, including real system operating rules. Table 14-2 lists
these studies; several are summarized below.

"This assumption may no longer be valid in some regions of the
world because of possible alterations in stochastic properties of
hydrological time series. Differences in the output of GCMs
coupled with the variety of hydrological transfer models make it
difficult to offer a reliable region-specific assessment of future
water availability. It is doubtful whether the current technique of
conducting “worst-case” analyses—wherein the most extreme
scenario of a given GCM is used to develop hydrological
responses—is useful for a critical appraisal of regional sensitiv-
ities to climate change. If anything, this type of analysis skews
the evaluation and deflects the search for pragmatic responses.
Progress in hydrological sensitivity analyses in developed
nations is accompanied by large information gaps for developing
countries that are most often affected by aridity and desertifica-
tion. Although numerous new water resources impact studies
have been conducted, few are from Africa, Asia, South America,
or developing countries in general.

Waterstone and Duckstein, 1995; Shiklomanov et al., 1995),
largely undertaken in the United States, have used scenarios
based on the three most recent transient GCM simulations
(GFDL-tr, UKMO-tr, and MPI-tr) to investigate possible
impacts on integrated, multipurpose water resources systems.
All of these studies note the difficulties in forecasting mean-
ingful impacts under the wide range of uncertainties inherent in
the analysis; in many cases, the GCM simulations did not
reproduce current catchment climate very well. However, a
general conclusion from the studies is that even with the large
variability in future climate represented by the three transient
GCM experiments, most of the systems investigated possess
the robustness and resilience to withstand those changes, and
adequate institutional capacity exists to adapt to changes in
growth, demands, and climate. This conclusion is in contrast to
that of many other studies—some summarized above—that

Gleick (1993), and Kirshen and Fennessey (1995) all examine
the effects of arbitrary changes in precipitation and temperature
inputs to investigate the sensitivity of their modeled water
resources systems to changes in inputs. A 20% reduction in
rainfall in the Acheloos basin in Greece, for example, would
increase the risk of system failure (inability to provide target
supplies) from less than 1% to 38% (Mimikou et al., 1991);
similarly, with a 20% reduction in rainfall, the New York City
reservoir system in the upper Delaware valley would be in a
“state of crisis” between 27% and 42% of the time, depending
on temperature increases (Wolock et al., 1993). Nash and

that water resources systems could be very vulnerable to change
in climatic inputs and that a small change in inputs could lead
to large changes in system performance, but that there is con-

gated in a number of small islands and has been found to be
potentially significant (see Chapter 9). Studies in Britain, how-
ever, have found that although there are many coastal aquifers
potentially at risk, a rise in sea level would have little effect on
intrusion and yields (Clark et al., 1992). Saline intrusion along
estuaries generally has been found to pose limited threats to
freshwater intakes because the change in the position of the salt
front is small relative to the intertidal range (Wolock ef al.,
1993; Dearnaley and Waller, 1993).

"This section has introduced some of the studies into water
resource availability that have been undertaken in the last five
years, There are several points to draw in conclusion. First,
there are considerable uncertainties in estimating impacts, due
partly to uncertainties in‘climate-change scenarios and partly to
difficulties in estimating the effects of adaptations—both
autonomous and climate-induced—over the next few decades.
Second, there is evidence that isolated, single-source systems
are more sensitive to change than integrated, multipurpose sys-
tems, which are considerably more robust. Much of the world’s
water, however, is managed through single-source, single-pur-
pose systems. Third, there is a suggestion that, in countries
with well-managed, integrated water resources, the additional
pressures introduced by climate change could be met, with
some costs, by techniques already in place to cope with chang-
ing demands and management objectives. There is little infor-
mation, however, about the economic and societal costs of this
adaptation. Waterstone et al. (1995), for example, conclude
that institutional adaptation—changes in water laws, organiza-
tions, prices, fees, water marketing, and reservoir operating cri-
teria—could serve to ameliorate the combined effects of
increasing population and warming in the semi-arid Rio
Grande basin in the southwestern United States, and Hobbs et
al. (1995) believe that conventional management practices for
coping with fluctuating lake levels would be capable of miti-
gating the effects of climate change on the Great Lakes. Fourth,
and perhaps most important, some studies (Riebsame er al.,
1995; Strzepek et al., 1995) show that water resources in
developing countries often are small-scale, isolated, and under
considerable stress and may have a difficult time adapting to
climate change effectively. Although the latter studies cover a

gests a 500 m3 per person per year threshold. On the other hand,
Rogers (1992) considers such thresholds not useful in develop-

460 m3, respectively—are doing quite well in managing, recy-

"Water availability, food production, population and economic
growth, and climate change are linked in a complex way.
Conflicts among interests are inherent in regional water man-

Four objectives important for sustainable water planning may
be identified: economic efficiency, environmental quality,
equity considerations, and reliability. Transformation in the
structure and characteristics of water supply and demand due
to climatic and nonclimatic factors may add new aspects to
existing social and political problems. Socioeconomic factors
greatly influence the ability to solve these problems in the
absence of necessary institutions, capital, and technology.

"The results show that in all countries with high population-
growth rates, future per capita water availability will decrease
independent of the assumed climate scenario. Large discrepan-

means of various atmospheric models. This example clearly
demonstrates how difficult it would be to initiate water resources
adaptation actions based on currently available methods of cli-
mate predictions. It can be expected that in many regions of the
world, nonclimatic factors will dictate what measures must be
undertaken to secure sustainable water supply (Frederick, 1994;
Rogers and Lydon, 1994). Predicted climate changes, however,
could redistribute water supplies, adding a new, highly uncertain
component to the challenge of managing water resources.

"Section 14.2 considered changes in the ability of water
resources systems to supply water; this section looks at the
demand side. It is useful to distinguish between offstream
demands—specifically domestic, industrial, and agricultural
demands—and instream demands, such as power generation,
navigation, recreation, and ecosystems protection. Increases in
water demand are driven by population and economic growth.
Demand management has two dimensions: the first long-term,
the second in response to short-term shortages. In the long
term, one can reduce offstream water demands substantially
through technological, economic, legal and administrative, and
educational measures. In the short term, demand during tem-
porary supply shortages can be managed through demand
reduction measures (such as rationing) and public education.

"Potable water has to be of the highest quality, whereas industry
and, to a lesser extent, agriculture can use lower-quality water.
Irrigation increasingly employs recycled “dirty” water, raising
concern about salinity and public acceptance of wastewater
use. Many water management problems around the world
today, in fact, relate to the quality of surface water and ground-
water. Climate change might exacerbate some of these prob-
lems by complicating an already expensive, evolving manage-

form of pollution, ranging from the discharge of untreated
sewage into watercourses to the discharge of treated sewage
effluent, the leaching of agricultural chemicals, and chemical
and thermal pollution from industry. There is a considerable
range of experience in dealing with water quality. In some
countries, the focus is on preventing poor water quality; in oth-

In order to avoid future conflicts over water use among ripari-

possibility is to form international water agencies or commis-

monitoring, and apportionment of water resources and due
account for possible changes caused by climatic trends. Joint
planning is essential for basin-scale water resources develop-

arbitrate on regional water issues and be supported by national
legal frameworks to back the regional arbitration accordingly. To
be able to fulfill this task, international water agencies in devel-

global-scale processes and, in some cases, external funding for

the developing world, complicating the water resource situa-

An increase in per capita demand of 21% is projected between

increase due to global warming—largely due to an increase in
garden water use. Other studies have found a similar percentage

known about the impact of climate change on domestic water

temperature will reduce the efficiency of cooling systems

water temperatures, particularly during extreme warm periods.
Several French nuclear power stations were forced to close
down or operate well below design capacity during the drought
of 1991. A reduction in water availability might lead to an
increase in the use of closed-cycle cooling systems as simulat-

cause significant impacts on long-term or annual total produc-

"At present, more than 65% of global water withdrawals is for
agricultural use; much of this is evaporated and consequently
lost to catchment runoff. Irrigation increased significantly until
the 1970s, when the rate of expansion fell sharply; since 1980,
the annual rate of expansion has been less than 1%—less than
the rate of population increase (Postel, 1992). Rapid expansion
in the future is unlikely as the cost of developing new schemes
increases and investments in irrigation decline. Agricultural
irrigation practices are inefficient in many areas of the world.
Changes in irrigation technology (such as the use of drop irri-
gation) often can compensate for anticipated increases in food
demands. The effects of climate change on agricultural policy
and irrigation requirements are discussed in Chapter 13. It is
important to emphasize that the effects of climate change on
agricultural demands for water, particularly for irrigation, will
depend significantly on changes in agricultural potential,
prices of agricultural produce, and water costs.

"Both rainfed and irrigated crops will require more water in a
warmer world, and this water may not be available through
increased precipitation. Allen et al. (1991) simulate changes in
irrigation demand in the Great Plains region of the United
States, showing that the demand for water to irrigate alfalfa
would increase, due largely to increases in the length of the crop
growing season and crop-water requirements during summer.
Another U.S. study—based on a Thornthwaite water-balance
model (McCabe and Wolock, 1992)—indicates that, for a broad
range of increases in temperature and precipitation, annual irri-
gation demand increases, even with a 20% increase in precipi-
tation. In a study in Lesotho, Amell and Piper (1995) simulate
an increase in irrigation demands of 7% with a 10% decline in
runoff and an increase of more than 20% with a 2°C increase in
temperature. They also examine the performance of a hypothet-
ical reservoir supplying irrigation water and find major changes
in the reliability of supply. Studies in the UK lead to the con-
clusion that an increase in temperature of 1.1°C by 2050 may
result in an increase in spray irrigation demands of 28%, over
and above a projected 75% increase to meet growing demands
(Herrington, 1995). Similar calculations in Poland result in a
12% increase in irrigation demands with a 1°C temperature
increase and a 1.8% change in water requirements with a 1%
precipitation change during the vegetation season. Irrigation
demand seems to be more sensitive to changes in temperature
than to changes in precipitation. Model results indicate that
increased stomatal resistance to transpiration counteracts the
effects of temperature increases on irrigation demand.

reservoir for recreation (Frederick, 1993), and a change in
_ water quality might also affect the recreational use of the water.
There are established procedures for estimating the economic
benefits of access to recreation, but the sensitivity of recre-

volume, water quality, and so forth—is not well known; the
effects of possible changes therefore are difficult to quantify.

implications of changes for sport fishing and aquaculture.
Hanemann and Dumas (1993) simulate the effects of one glob-
al warming scenario on Chinook salmon runs in the
Sacramento River, California, and find a reduction in the

"The final instream use to be considered in this section is
ecosystem protection. Instream ecosystems demand a certain
minimum quantity of water (which may vary throughout the
year), and water managers in many countries increasingly are
balancing these demands with those of more traditional water
users. Several techniques are being developed to estimate
instream demands (Stalnaker, 1993); these techniques can be
used in principle to estimate the effects on these demands of
changes in water availability. However, this has not yet been
done, largely because the instream demand models are very
uncertain. In principle, it might be possible to maintain certain
aquatic ecosystems by managing river flow regimes to mini-
mize changes, but this is perhaps not desirable in an ecological
sense because it would create a system that would not be sus-
tainable without human intervention. The general issue of man-
aging the impacts of climate change on natural ecosystems is
discussed in Chapter 10 and elsewhere.

"Riebsame et al. (1995) examine hydropower generation in four
developing-country basins. In the Zambezi basin, the possible
reduction of hydropower at Lake Kariba could be replaced by
the construction of a new plant at Batoka Gorge, but for a sig-
nificant cost. Hanemann and McCann (1993) examine the eco-
nomic cost of changes in hydropower potential in northern
California. Under a scenario based on the GFDL equilibrium
GCM, annual hydropower production would decrease by
3.8%; production would be 48% higher in January but as much
as 20% lower during the peak-load summer months. Water
would have to be released during the spring to leave room for
flood control. As a result of the reduced hydropower genera-
tion, production of power by natural gas would have to
increase by 11% to meet the same demands, leading to a $145
million (1993 prices) increase in annual system costs (12.5%).
In some cases, the expected shift in the runoff hydrograph,
combined with changes in the distribution of irrigation water
demands, may lead to reduced energy generation.

"Changes in flow regimes and lake levels can be expected to
affect navigation potential, but there have been very few stud-
ies on this topic. The sensitivity of river navigation to extreme
conditions was well illustrated on the Mississippi River during
the drought of 1988, when river traffic was severely restricted
(with consequent effects on the agricultural sector due to diffi-
culties in transporting the grain harvest). High river flows also
restrict navigation by increasing energy costs and flooding
riverside facilities. Navigation on the river Rhein, for example,
is constrained by periods of both high and low flows, and con-
siderable sums are spent on dredging and maintaining chan-
nels; a change in sediment load could have major implications
for these activities. An increase in temperature, however,
would increase the duration of the navigation season on rivers
affected by seasonal ice cover. Studies in the Great Lakes
(Chao et al., 1994) suggest that a longer shipping season due to
a reduction in ice cover would just compensate for lost draft
due to lower levels; shipping companies would be able to
adjust their operating season in the Great Lakes because many
of the raw materials transported are stockpiled.

related services. Because different uses have different priorities
and risk tolerances, the balance points among them after climate
change could be quite different from the present (e.g.,
hydropower and instream uses may be lost disproportionately
compared to water supply). No enterprise is risk-free: Society
decides on the level of risk-bearing through the acceptance of
certain levels of risk and reliability, as expressed by cost-effec-

additional increment of risk typically rises rapidly as reliability
approaches 100%. Hence, water managers usually deal with

"Different strategies apply to different circumstances.
Watersheds that have little or no control over natural flows and
are largely dependent on precipitation must implement a differ-
ent set of water management strategies than river basins with a
high degree of control in the form of reservoirs, canals, levees,

- and so forth. Similarly, rapidly urbanizing areas will require dif-
ferent responses than agricultural regions. There is no standard
prescribed approach. However, a rational management strategy
undertaken to deal with the reasonably foreseeable needs of a
region in the absence of climate change, according to the prin-
ciples espoused in Agenda 21, also will serve to offset many of
the possible adverse consequences of climate change.
"	List
"Engineering design is largely concerned with performance and
reliability. Once a particular plan is selected, engineers ensure
that each of the separate components functions as planned and
that, collectively, the water management system performs reli-
ably. This was true in Roman times (Frontinus, 98 AD) as well
as in contemporary times. Water resources systems are
designed to perform reliably over most but not all of the range
of anticipated hydrological variability. That reliability criterion
is determined through a combination of risk, costs, benefits,
environmental impacts, and societal preference. Hence, if cli-
mate change alters the frequency, duration, and intensity of
droughts and floods, new reliability criteria will evolve over
time to adjust for the perceived changes in both availability and
use—as will the corresponding types of adaptive behavior.
"	Text
"The nature of contemporary water resources management is
such that countless numbers of principal factors, economic cri-
teria, and design standards are incorporated simply because
of the complexity of integrated water management (e.g.,
hydropower, ecosystem support, water supply) and objectives
(e.g., reliability, costs, safety). Some factors that are routinely
assessed inherently represent design thresholds such as the min-
imum instream flow required for maintaining an aquatic
ecosystem or the “probable maximum flood” that is used for
most dam-safety risk analyses. The accepted level of water sup-
ply reliability of a system is a threshold as well, determined
essentially by public preference, economics, and engineering
analysis. Planning, by its nature, has inherent risks and develops
alternative plans that are packages of complementary actions,
project regulations, and management measures that reduce risks
"	Text
"It also is useful to think of hydrological or watershed response
sensitivity to change measured in terms of physical effects. A
complementary notion is the susceptibility of various water-
use sectors (e.g., hydropower, irrigation, recreation) to incre-
mental changes of outputs (e.g., kilowatt-hours, revenues, vis-
itors). Finally, the vulnerability to failure of a water manage-
ment system itself—consisting of pipes, pumping stations,
reservoirs, and delivery rates—also must be appraised in terms
of reliability targets measured as changes in quality, quantity,
and probability. To that end, water resources planners, hydrol-
ogists, and design engineers have developed a set of practices
that explicitly address a range of hydrological, economic, and
engineering risk and uncertainty factors and implicitly encom-
pass some notion of sensitivities and thresholds. Fiering (1982)
and Hashimoto et al. (1982a, 1982b) developed the concepts of
robustness (sensitivity of design parameters and economic
costs to variability); reliability (a measure of how often a sys-
tem is likely to fail); resiliency (how quickly a system recovers
from failure); vulnerability (the severity of the consequences of
failure); and brittleness (the capacity of “optimal” solutions to
accommodate an uncertain future). Many if not most of these
concepts are analyzed as part of contemporary hydrological
and water resources management decisions (Kundzewicz and
Somlyody, 1993; Kaczmarek et al., 1995). Riebsame et al.
(1995) analyze the sensitivities and adaptabilities of five inter-
national river basins in the context of the criteria discussed
above. The results are presented in Table 14-4.

demands are likely to compete with the irrigated agricultural
sector—which uses about 88% of all water withdrawn in
Africa, 86% of all water withdrawn in Asia, and 87% of all
water withdrawn in the arid Middle East and North Africa
(World Bank, 1994). New sources of supply will have to be

"Although the potential impact of global warming on the occur-
rence of flood disasters has been alluded to frequently in pop-
ular accounts of global warming, there have been very few
studies addressing the issue explicitly. This is largely because
it is difficult to define credible scenarios for changes in flood-
producing climatic events (Beran and Arnell, 1995). Chapter
10 outlines the potential effects of global warming on riverine
floods, and Chapter 9 reviews the effects of a rise in sea level
and changes in storms on coastal flooding. This section con-
siders the implications of changes in flood occurrence for flood
risk and management. There are four major implications: a
change in flood loss, a change in flood risk and the standard of
service currently provided by flood management and protec-
tion schemes, a change in the cost of protecting against floods,
and impacts on public and private financial institutions.
"	Text
"The reality is that increasing water demands will intensify
competition for scarce water and further concentrate water use
in urban centers. During the next 30 years, these real and com-
plex needs will preoccupy water managers. Water management
planning will address these needs, which precede the climate-
change signal and thereby serve as a de facto adaptation mech-
anism. Climate change, in its many manifestations, is likely to
be a perturbation on what are already difficult and complicated
water management problems. Existing drainage systems,
water-control structures, and conveyance and distribution sys-
tems typically are designed on the basis of design floods or
droughts of different return periods and/or annual exceedance
probabilities, which are derived from past failures and associ-
ated perceived degrees of tolerable risk and economic costs.
Because there is a significant turnover in water management
infrastructure, with considerable maintenance and major reha-
bilitation occurring in most countries about every 30 years, it
can be expected that the operating capacity of such structures
can be made to conform to evolving changes in climate.
Analytical tools are available to provide the necessary degree
of confidence in the design and operation of such systems in a
reliable manner.
"	Text
"This is not to suggest that we can become complacent in our
response to climate change. The challenges and barriers to imple-
menting the water management principles of Agenda 21 are dif-
ficult enough to overcome. The water situation in the Middle East
and North Africa is precarious and projected to deteriorate as a
consequence of population growth and unplanned development.
In sub-Saharan Africa (World Bank, 1994), the water situation is
expected to worsen due to desert encroachment and drying up of
water sources as a result of increased deforestation. Droughts,
desertification, and water shortages are a permanent feature of
daily life in those countries. The list of nations with water supply
problems will expand with the accelerated pace of urbanization.
By the year 2030, urban populations will be twice the size of rural
populations. By 2000, there will be 21 cities in the world with
more than 10 million inhabitants, 17 of which will be in devel-
oping countries. It is expected that the population without safe
drinking water will increase from 1 billion people in 1990 to 2.4
billion by 2030, assuming a “business-as-usual” scenario.
Similarly, population without adequate sanitation will grow from
1,7 billion to 3.2 billion by the year 2030 (World Bank, 1992).
Addressing these issues would make it easier to cope with the
impacts of climate change when and if they become significant
(PCC, 1992; Goklany, 1992).

"‘ihere 1s a growing tendency to devise management systems that
complement supply development with demand management.
Nonstructural management measures are increasingly relied on
to provide needed robustness without decreasing the overall reli-
ability of a system. Hence, flood-control levees in the United
States are now designed to provide varying levels of protection,
whereas in the past there was a fixed level of flood protection
based on a calculation of the “standard project flood.” Today, a
levee can be designed to offer protection against a flood with a
2% chance of occurrence (a 50-year return period) in conjunc-
tion with a well-organized flood warning and evacuation plan.
For example, all 360 U.S. Corps of Engineers reservoirs have
both drought contingency plans and flood warning and dam-
safety evacuation plans. However, it is important to remember
that the combination of numerous design factors, operating
tules, reservoir storage allocation decisions, flood forecasting
and evacuation planning, and drought contingency planning pro-
vides a considerable degree of robustness, resiliency, and flexi-
bility to contend with uncertainty and surprises. Coupled with
demand management and institutional and regulatory changes
that are needed to cope with anticipated changes in population
and demands, water management systems of this scale, if prop-
erly managed, offer a well-balanced strategy for dealing with
risk and uncertainty, including many of the impacts of climate
change. The purpose is to reduce, if not minimize, the adverse
social, economic, and environmental consequences of changes
in water resources regardless of the agent of change (Stakhiv,
1994), although the costs of adaptation to climate change could
be substantial. Most important is the reality that water resources
management is an inherently continuous adaptive endeavor at
many different levels and spatial scales.

"It might be easier, however, to detect a change in the stan-
dard of service provided by existing flood management
schemes. Flood protection works and flood plain land-use
plans usually are based on either a risk analysis to determine
the most cost-effective level of protection (balancing costs
against benefits) or on some legislative or institutional
guideline for standard of service. Urban-flood-protection
works, for example, typically provide protection against
floods with a return period of up to 100 years. A change in
flood frequency characteristics can have a very significant
effect on flood risk and hence standards of service: A small
change in flood magnitudes can have a very large effect on
the risk of a particular critical value being exceeded. Beran
and Arnel] (1995) have shown that, assuming statistical
properties similar to those of British rivers, a 10% increase
in the mean—with no change in the year-to-year variability
of ftoods—would result in a current 10-year flood occurring
on average once every 7 years.

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
"	Title
"The fundamental question on which this chapter focuses
involves forest resource availability and resource consumption:
Will the resources from future forests be adequate to meet
future needs? Although all forest amenities are of interest, this
chapter concentrates primarily upon those for which data are
most available, reliable, and measurable: wood and wood prod-
ucts. All of the conclusions depend upon uncertain climate
mode] simulations (resource availability), uncertainty in adap-
tive changes in forest product use, and uncertain regional
human population growth scenarios (resource consumption).
Assuming all of these variables change as projected by their
respective scenarios, the following forest resource responses
are likely (note that none of the conclusions summarized below
were considered in the 1990-1992 IPCC Assessments):
"	Text
"Tropical land use will be much more important than
change in climate and atmospheric chemistry in
affecting forest product availability there, at least until
the middle of the next century (High Confidence).
Growing stock in the tropics is projected to decline by
about half from anthropogenic deforestation, while
consumption is predicted to expand because of a
threefold increase of population. The projected stand-
ing stock decline appears even after calculation of
concomitant changes in climate and atmospheric
chemistry, which could increase both productivity and
the areas where tropical forests can potentially grow.
Under these circumstances, tropical forests of densely
populated countries in Africa and Asia would be most
vulnerable to loss (High Confidence). These areas
contain rapidly expanding human populations and
concomitant increasing needs for forest products,
especially but not entirely for fuelwood. Fuelwood
consumption is expected to increase throughout the
55-year study period (High Confidence).
Temperate-zone wood requirements are likely to con-
tinue being met for at least the next century (Medium
Confidence). This conclusion is based on assumed cli-
mate and land use changes that leave temperate forest
covering about as much land by the year 2050 as today.
Also, current harvests from plantations and wildland
forests are expected to increase only marginally.
Additionally, annual growth increments are assumed to
remain constant through 2050. Finally, an increasing
proportion of requirements for wood is expected to be
met by imports from outside the temperate zone.
Future wood availability in boreal regions is uncertain
at best, based on current data, scenarios, and models
(High Confidence). Future production is expected to
"	List
"be controlled by increases in climate-induced irregu-
lar and large-scale mortality events, which cannot be
simulated or predicted with current models. These
could generate considerable surplus wood from sal-
vage fellings, but would severely decrease standing
stocks over the long term. In addition, current and
future harvests in boreal forests are expected to be
largely determined by needs outside the zone. The
models underlying future projections contain no con-
sideration of these forest economic or trade processes
or their implications, a particularly critical omission
in boreal regions. Therefore, the available information
does not support realistic analysis of future boreal for-
est product demand.

Total global wood consumption will exceed the avail-
ability expected by the year 2050 (Medium Confidence).
Analysis of increasing human populations, with the
assumption of constant per capita wood use, suggests
that the annual need for timber will exceed the current
2% annual growth increment before the year 2050.
Although we assume that the annual increment will
remain constant, it could increase slightly from warming
and enhanced atmospheric CO, concentrations, or it
could decrease greatly from growth declines and mortal-
ity brought on by climate change.

Future temperate and possibly tropical zone require-
ments for boreal forest products may result in serious
shortfalls of boreal industrial roundwood during the
21st century based on the analysis of temperate and
tropical zone forest standing stocks and requirements
(High Confidence).

The livelihood of indigenous tropical peoples will be
adversely affected if climate and land-use change
induce forest losses (High Confidence). These peoples
depend on a large diversity of forest products that are
expected to undergo declines in biodiversity and forest
regeneration due to climate change and may be subject
to forest degradation apart from land conversion.
Options for adapting to and ameliorating potential
global timber supply shortages in the future include
the following actions: In the tropics, the greatest
progress may be achieved by reducing social pressures
driving land conversion (e.g., by increasing crop and
livestock productivity on current agricultural lands)
and by development of large tree plantations (High
Confidence). In temperate areas, use of modern
forestry practices to reduce harvest impacts on ecosys-
tems, combined with substitution of nontimber prod-
ucts for forest products, could reduce climate impacts

"growth (High Confidence), and (2) uniform reporting
and assembly of national forest inventory data sets

needed especially to (a) simulate transient (lagged)
responses of forests to rapid climate change, (b) inte-
grate relationships among climate changes, ecological
responses, and economic forces and responses, and

the most useful focus may be on adapting to potential
climate-induced large-scale disturbances, such as by
rapid reforestation of disturbed areas with warmth-
adapted seed provenances (Medium Confidence).

in above- and belowground biomass stocks of forests. This

"The term “availability” of roundwood is used throughout this
report, rather than the economically significant term “supply.”
Roundwood availability (as distinguished from supply or pro-
duction) depends on the amount of growing stock and on annu-
al growth increments. These are determined by climate, soils,
management, and forested area. Only a fraction of growing
stocks is normally considered as commercial forest, and only a
fraction of commercial forest is available for harvest (supply).
Even if harvested wood equalled growing stock—say, by appli-
cation of advanced technologies—wood products can only be
harvested up to the amount of available growing stock. Hence,
growing stock is a more conservative estimator of the funda-
mental limit to harvests than is some smaller quantity, such as
sustainable harvest level (see Section 15.5.2).

mate, will the availability from future forests be adequate to
meet future needs under predicted future climates? The analy-
sis avoids the more complex issues of economic responses to
changes in potential growing stocks (as expected in decreas-
ing prices because of enhanced harvests from use of new tech-
nologies, increasing prices from decreasing supplies, and
changing prices from product substitution resulting from
increasing prices). It concentrates instead on estimating the
quantity of growing stock to which economics must be applied
and the size of the population needing forest products.

"In contrast to variables controlling growing stocks, harvests
from forests will depend on the technology available to harvest
and market roundwood, and demand for the resulting wood
products (and hence, price of the products), as well as the
amount of growing stock itself. Demand for wood products
(“need” and “consumption” are noneconomic terms used in
this report in place of “demand”) and related amenities will
change with shifts in size and geographic distribution of popu-
lation, with technological and financial prosperity of end users,
with price of the products, with availability of alternative prod-
ucts, and so on. Assessment of these variables is beyond the
scope of the current chapter, although they could be profitably
examined in the next IPCC assessment report. Here, we
assume that per capita consumption remains constant and that
population size increases as in the IS92A population projection
(IPCC, 1992). In developed countries (e.g., Australia), per
capita consumption actually declined during the last decade
(FAO, 1992) and could do so in other countries in the future.

"This chapter examines the changes induced in human-valued
properties and products of forests (primarily wood and wood
products) by potential shifts in vigor, productivity, and geo-
graphic distribution of tree species populations and of forest
ecosystems. These shifts are expected to arise from global
changes in climate and atmospheric chemistry. In addition, this
chapter examines the roles of other forces—particularly of land
use, which may modify or mask effects of changing climate
and atmospheric chemistry. The changing commodities and
amenities derived from forests are a tertiary response to the ini-
tial forcing caused by increased atmospheric concentrations of
greenhouse gases. As such, the commodities cannot be esti-
mated reliably until accurate forecasts are made of the inter-
mediate processes and outcomes (climate, atmospheric chem-
istry, and resulting forest density and growth patterns). On the
other hand, we can and do assess the socioeconomic responses
to quantitative estimates of changing climate, land use, and for-
est ecosystem responses that are expected to arise from current
practices and processes and from potential future ones.

wood products between 1986 and 1988 were estimated at $68
billion, of which $10 billion was earned by developing countries
(Sharma et al., 1992), Many developing (tropical) countries rely
heavily on their forest resources for obtaining capital. For exam-

"The assessment recommended that impact analysis focus upon
transitional climate and forest responses that may be with us
for several decades, rather than on a single future long-term
“equilibrium” climate. Finally, it recommended that “in the
face of great uncertainties about rates and magnitudes of cli-
matic changes, forest responses to potential climate change,
and socioeconomic repercussions of climate-induced forest
changes, it is prudent to prepare for severe undesirable impacts
to ensure that viable and flexible options are implemented to
maintain sustainable forest ecosystems.” The results of our
report are consonant with these two fundamental recommenda-

developed to go a step further in documenting the level of pre-

less quantifiable but relevant estimators of timber availability

"Globally, forests in 1990 covered one-fourth to one-third of the
earth’s land surface (34 million km?, FAO, 1993a; 41 million
km?, Dixon et al., 1994; see Chapter 1 for a detailed descrip-
tion). Although the great majority of these forests can be con-
sidered as managed to some degree, only about 4% of forests
consist of intensively managed plantations (1.35 million km2,
Kanowski et al., 1990; 1.12 million km?, Dixon, et al., 1994).
WRI (1994) cites a doubling of forest plantations during the
decade from 1980 to 1990, with three-fourths of all plantations
being in Asia. The plantations may produce a disproportionate
amount of forest products. About 30% of industrial timber pro-
duction (industrial roundwood, i.e., non-fuelwood raw logs) in
Latin America, for example, may have originated on plantations
(McGaughey and Gregerson, 1982). Brown et al. (Chapter 24)
point out that about 11% of the world’s forests undergo active
management; this includes 20% of mid-latitude and 17% of
high-latitude forests but only about 4% of low-latitude forests.

There is no indication that a stable climate will appear in the foreseeable future. Indeed, the global change prob-
lem to be assessed involves rapidly changing climate, not stable climate, during the next 50 to 100 years. The
static models do not simulate impacts of rapid climate change on slowly responding forests, and current efforts
aimed at parameterizations of the process will beg the question.

Static models do not simulate tree mortality. In a warmer and potentially drier world, the geography of forest
ecosystems is expected to shift, as it has many times during climate changes of the past (e.g., Huntley and Webb,
1989). This may be detected initially as negative or positive changes in seedling survival, growth and productivity
of established trees, and eventually by forest decline as the environmental variables exceed species tolerances.
Such forest decline is likely to be amplified by increases in tree mortality events (dieback), disease and insect out-
breaks, fire, and damage associated with extremes in weather, none of which are simulated by the static models.
Static models assume that trees instantaneously occupy new, climatically suitable areas. However, current pro-
jections of climate change appear to be too rapid to allow population geography to adjust: If the Holocene tree
species migration rate of 0.2-0.4 km/yr (Davis, 1976, 1983; Huntley and Webb, 1989, suggest 0.1 to 1 km/yr
based on examination of extant paleoecological data) records maximum tree migration rates, trees may be
unable to attain the 4-6 km/yr rate of climate change expected (Solomon et al., 1984). As a result, large areas of
low productivity or degraded forest (forest lacking a full complement of growing stock and tree species, con-
sisting instead of slowly growing and dying trees made ecologically inappropriate by climate change) could be
present for centuries.

Static models assume that new forested areas instantaneously grow to maturity and can be harvested. Thirty to
50 years or more of relatively stable climate are required to reach a harvestable condition of most species once
the tree is established. Therefore, most of the new areas capable of supporting forests may consist of young,
immature trees. Establishment of these trees under the expected regeneration-unfriendly conditions is potential-
ly an even more serious problem.

Static models do not account for differences in short- and long-term forest productivity. However, a forest in
decline in the short run (50-70 years) will increase the available wood supply. If there are large areas of dead or
dying trees, much of this wood probably will be harvested or salvaged. In the long run (>75 years), however,
roundwood availability could decrease because of the immaturity of new species populations.

Static models assume that the soil conditions will be suitable for new tree invasions. However, in boreal
regions, permafrost and excess surface water dominate many landscapes, prohibiting uptake of nitrates. Recent
glaciation at high latitudes has endowed large areas with thin soils or bare rock. In many tropical areas, prior
intensive agriculture has so depleted the soil of phosphorus that tree growth is exceedingly slow. These soil fea-
tures could form major barriers to immigration and growth even at the slow rates projected by models, making
it unlikely that the forest tree populations will be able to migrate at their measured rate of 0.2-0.4 kmn/yr or
reach maturity at their natural rate of 20 to 50 years.

"IMAGE has been used to project the implications of these pop-

"The areas of tropical, temperate, and boreal forests estimated

initially estimates that 37% more land is in forests than does
IMAGE. The differences appear to arise from a much larger

seems likely that BIOME results are less accurate in temper-

greatest difference in 1990 zonal composition between

density of agricultural land use is found, followed by boreal

land use at that time, it is the land use projections that must be

large increase in temperate forest area in BIOME simulations

"Differences in projected boreal forest area are also great. The
BIOME losses of 20-50% (Table 15-1) become increases of
10% in boreal forest land (Table 15-2) by IMAGE. BIOME
assumes that 50% of the area in which climate permits agricul-

biomes on the remaining land. IMAGE assumes that declining
agricultural demand will allow regrowth of climatically appro-
priate forests on abandoned farmland but that forests will not be
redistributed on undisturbed lands regardless of new climate
conditions. This has the effect of eliminating instant forest
migration/maturation on lands undisturbed by intensive land
use—which are the vast majority of lands in boreal regions,
much less in temperate regions, and the minority of lands in
many tropical regions. This assumption should be more correct
than the assumption of instantaneous migration during the sim-
ulated 60 year period (see Box 15-1). Few tree populations in
the past 10,000 years have required less than a century to
migrate latitudinally across even one of the 55 km pixels simu-

be degraded by illicit and selective fellings. Also, forest growth
may decline and mortality may increase from increasingly inap-
propriate climate (Solomon and Leemans, 1990; see also
Chapter 1). This growth loss also was not included in the cal-
culations that produced Table 15-3. Solomon (1986) used a
transient forest response model to calculate an approximate
10% decrease in annual biomass increment at 21 locations in
temperate and boreal forests of eastern North America at the
time of CO, doubling. There were 50% decreases in simulated
temperate forests, while boreal sites had increases of several-
fold where forests replaced open shrublands.

would drive fuelwood prices beyond the reach of all but the richest

"Current annual global need is approximately 1% of potential
global growing stocks (derived from values for product avail-

parable to values for individual regions calculated by others
(e.g., Kauppi et al., 1992; Dixon et al., 1994; Nilsson and
Schopfhauser, 1995). Need is projected to reach nearly 3% of
global productive standing stocks by the year 2050 (6.12 x 10°
m3), as need almost doubles and global growing stock declines
by one-fourth or one-fifth. In tropical regions, where as much
as 90% of forest production is consumed as fuelwood (FAO,
1993a), need for fuelwood reaches nearly 5% (34.1 x 108 m3)
of growing stocks by 2050.

"The projected annual need for industrial roundwood and fuel-
wood/charcoal is well within annual increments projected for
growing stocks in boreal and temperate countries. In tropical
countries, however, a wood product availability shortfall of
some 2% of total standing stocks occurs by 2050; that is, 2%
more wood is needed than is being grown each year. If fossil
fuels are substituted with fuels from biomass, the shortfall is
likely to be more severe, The need for forest products will not
necessarily coincide with demand for forested land for agricul-
ture. For example, trees felled for agriculture in Table 15-3 will
not all be used to meet the need for forest products in Table 15-
4. Hence, the need estimated here is a minimal value and is
probably a significant underestimate of growing stock losses to
consumption of both roundwood and agricultural land.
"	Text
"In summary, the availability of forest products in the year 2050,
as limited by climate and land use, appears to be adequate to
meet projected needs in temperate and boreal regions but not in
tropical regions. There, calculated consumption appears to
define a serious shortfall of future availability. This conclusion
is based on an obvious increase in demand, especially for fuel-
wood, Also, an increasing population may convert forests to
farms to provide food and may be forced to rely on industrial
roundwood for export income. The fuelwood forest resources
are primarily of benefit to less-developed tropical countries, and
their loss may well be important for populations in the most
crowded countries. The developed countries of temperate and
boreal regions may not be significantly affected by losses of the
roundwood supplies they purchase from the tropics because
these can be obtained from regions of low population density
(and, hence, of low fuelwood consumption). Additionally, the
developed countries are able to substitute other products for the
wood products in current use. For example, timber in residen-
tial and commercial buildings currently is being replaced by
styrofoam blocks filled with reinforced concrete and by steel
structures in some parts of the United States and Europe.

"The IPCC (1992) Response Strategies Working Group has esti-

ure considerably higher than the estimates generated by the
IMAGE model and used in estimating growing stock volume
in Section 15.2.3. The cropland in Africa alone is projected to
increase from 163 Mha in 1990 to 347 Mha by 2025

"Domestic animals are an important factor, reducing forest
regeneration by browsing on seedlings and by trampling
seedlings and compacting soils. Livestock, including cattle,
sheep, and goats, are increasing in Africa and Latin America. In
India, for example, the density of domestic livestock is 6 ani-
mals/ha of forest (405 million animals in 1982 on 64 Mha). In
Africa there is 1 animal/ha of forest (see Figure 15-6 and FAO,
1993b), The total livestock population globally is expected to
increase by a factor of three by 2050 (Zuidema et al., 1994).
Thus, the total livestock population in Africa would be 1.69 bil-
lion by 2050, grazing on declining forests and pasture land.

"The increasing human activity in tropical forests will affect
more than just the current standing stocks, Tree felling and
wood extraction in the tropics commonly destroy one-tenth to
one-third of the advance regeneration and growth in remaining

due to expanding agriculture, need for wood by human popula-
tion, and livestock grazing pressure will seriously affect forest
regeneration, particularly in tropical Asia and Africa. Soil mois-
ture deficits projected for Africa and part of Brazil (IPCC, 1992)
will severely hamper forest succession. Increased frequency of

"tropical forest product availability during the next century.
They suggest that the availability of forest products could
decline by about one-half from land-use pressures, even
though changes in climate and atmospheric chemistry during
this period appear likely to increase the area where tropical
forests can potentially grow. The analyses in Section 15.2 con-
trast the potential decline in forest volume with the more than
three-fold increase in need for forest products, especially, for
fuelwood, to support local subsistence. The scenario indicates
that by the year 2050, tropical regions could be subject to seri-
ous deficiencies—up to 2% of standing stocks—between annu-
al availability and need. The discussion in Sections 15.3.1
through 15.3.3 evaluates those conclusions.

"Two primary forces are currently involved in tropical forest
change and are likely to continue in importance in the future.
First, human population growth in developing countries, which
are primarily tropical countries, is 2 to 3% annually, and popu-
lation is expected to reach 8.7 billion by the middle of the next
century (UNFPA, 1992). If tropical regions undergo economic
prosperity during the twenty-first century, the need for forest
trees and products could increase drastically to generate urban
structures and jobs for increasing urban populations. On the
other hand, if prosperity falters and large numbers of destitute
people seek subsistence unavailable in cities and urban areas,
forests and wood supplies are likely to undergo considerable
degradation as humans migrate into forests. No matter what
future changes in climate and uses of tropical forests occur,
effects of the rapidly growing and dense populations in tropi-
cal regions will amplify those changes.

"Second, the rate of deforestation is very rapid and likely to con-
tinue so. It was 15.4 Mha annually (of 1,756 Mha, or 0.8%) for
the period 1981-90—higher than in the previous decade (FAO,
1993b). Degradation of remaining forests (such as change from
closed to open forests) due to grazing, fires, excessive logging,
and fuelwood gathering leads to loss of plant diversity and
standing biomass (i.e., forest degradation; Brown et al., 1991;
Flint and Richards, 1991). For example, in Africa, much of the
change in closed forest cover of 1.5 Mha from 1981 to 1990 was
directly attributable to local population growth (FAO 1993b):
34% was from conversion of forests to short fallow agriculture,
which reflects the needs of rural populations; 25% was change
of closed forests to open forest or forest degradation resulting in
loss of tree canopy due to human pressure; 19% was change
from forests to fragmented forest interspersed with agrarian
land uses, which represents gradual deforestation because these
fragments are eventually converted to agriculture; and 16% was
change of forest area to other forest cover.

poses (e.g., food, fodder, oil seeds, gum, nuts, rattan, bam-
boo, and raw material for a range of industrial products, as
well as locally used products like baskets, mats, tools, leaf

"Note that estimated need for fuelwood in the tropical countries
increases by about 2.5 times to 2050, but in Africa it increas-
es by 3.3 times (Table 15-6). Yet fuelwood availability in
Africa, like the rest of the tropics, is expected to decline by
about half during the same time period (Table 15-3). Hence,
the projected deficit of need over availability of tropical fuel-
wood may be most critical in tropical Africa. In addition,
export of industrial roundwood, which might be used to offset
fuelwood deficits, is already very low (Table 15-6), with 89%
of African forest harvest being devoted to fuelwood (FAO,
1993a). Examination of tropical forest area changes projected
in Table 15-2 and population changes used in the IMAGE pro-
jections (Alcamo et al., 1994) indicates that the fuelwood
need problem will increase in severity, as the current 0.84 ha

"In summary, the shortfall of wood during the 21st century, pro-
jected for tropical areas in Section 15.2.4, appears to underes-
timate the potential problem. Tropical countries will face seri-
ous shortages in forest products required for subsistence (fuel-
wood, wood and fibers for construction, fruits and nuts for
food). However, wise land-use policy may mitigate some of the
forest losses.

"In India and Brazil, the choice of short-rotation forestry will
only meet the need for industrial wood and fuelwood (and
charcoal), not for sawn logs for structural uses. Thus, forest
plantations (largely softwood) are no substitute for logging in
forests for hardwoods. Climate change can worsen the situa-
tion by affecting forest regeneration due to warming and
decreased availability of soil moisture. There is a possibility
that a large area could be planted to hardwoods and long-rota-
tion plantations such as teak.

"Notably, the area under dense forest (>40% tree crown cover) increases in each assessment, suggesting an increase in carbon
stocks sequestered by Indian forests. Responsible factors include the Forest Conservation Act of 1980, which bans all con-
version of tropical forest land to non-forest uses, and the world’s largest afforestation program (FAO, 1993b). This exempli-
fies the adaptation potential of tropical countries to declines in forest areas and demonstrates the limitations of projections of
future forest area based on population growth rates, such as those from IMAGE (used to construct Tables 15-2 and 15-3).

"The scenarios discussed in Sections 15.2.3 and 15.2.4 suggest
that temperate forests could cover about as much land by 2050
as they do today, and that current consumption (3.1% of stand-
ing stock, based on Tables 15-3 and 15-4) may increase only
slightly by 2050 (3.8% of standing stock). With a 3-3.5% annu-
al growth increment in temperate zone trees (FAO, 1992), and
with an increasing proportion of need being met by imports from
outside the temperate zone (FAO, 1993a), the scenario analysis
in Section 15.2 indicates that temperate-zone forests are likely to
continue meeting the need for forest products on a sustainable

"The scenario analysis above defined no significant climate or
land-use related declines in future forest availability. Forest
survey measurements are consonant with this analysis.
Considering that carbon storage from net ecosystem produc-

early 1970s and the late 1980s and is further increasing, the
wood resource is seen as plentiful for the foreseeable future, if
no unexpected catastrophic events occur (Kauppi et al., 1992).
The remarkable net ecosystem production (NEP) increment in
the last two decades may relate less to intrinsic productivity of
forests than to increased forest area generated as European
agriculture decreased while imports of less-expensive foreign
lumber increased (more than one-third of global industrial
roundwood imports in 1990; approximately 10% less than
Japan imported, and six times the imports by North America;
FAO, 1993a). If so, change in land-use policy or in costs of
imported roundwood would have a great impact on European

partly by increases of imports. A great portion of these may
come from other temperate forested countries, such as
Canada, New Zealand, and Chile, but also from plantations in

only the temperate deciduous forests are considered, the forest-

(Zuidema, 1994). In contrast, temperate forest area projected by
BIOME under four different climate scenarios increases
between 25 and 52% by the time the climate resulting from a
doubled CO, concentration occurs (Table 15-1). If either the
BIOME projections for all temperate forests or the IMAGE pro-

"In the developed countries of the temperate zone there is a high
and growing need for assets that support a high quality of life.
This has produced a change from the wood production point of
view to a multiple-use perspective (FAO, 1993c). These needs
are not considered in the scenario analysis of Section 15.2 but
will generate considerable change in wood availability (much
of it being removed from accessibility) and need. The non-
wood functions (soil protection, recreation, biodiversity, and
cultural uses) and goods and services (fruits, honey, water sup-
ply, and so on) are of very high importance. Table 15-9 gives
an overview of the importance of main forest functions in some
temperate regions.

"Table 15-9 shows that in Europe and the United States, other
functions than wood production have high importance in rele-
vant areas. For most of the developed temperate-zone coun-
tries, it is the explicit policy to emphasize non-wood functions
of their forests, especially functions of water protection and
recreation (FAO, 1993c). The economic evaluation of these
benefits is much more complex than that of wood production
because, for most of these values drawn from the forests, sup-
ply and demand generally are not regulated by market mecha-
nisms, There are only a few non-timber products that have a
direct economic importance for individual countries—for
example, cork in Portugal and Spain, chestnuts in Italy, or
Christmas trees in Denmark—but they have immediate effects
on local people and communities.

"One of the most important anthropogenic effects on forest
product availability in temperate zones in the past has been
intensive land use. Nevertheless, until now in Europe, stable
food demand, substantial producer subsidies, and high produc-
tivity increases have generated enormous surpluses of agricul-
tural products. As a consequence, the use of arable land
decreased substantially in these regions. The situation is simi-
lar in the United States and Japan. In the European Community
(EC) up to 44 Mha could go out of agriculture without sub-
stantial decreases in productivity (Eisenkramer, 1987,
Delorme, 1987). Therefore, in western Europe the common
agricultural policy of the EC will be a more important driving
force for future changes in land use than climate-induced
ecosystem changes (Kitamura and Parry, 1993). This phenom-
enon is abstracted in IMAGE model projections (Table 15-2)
and is responsible for the simulated increase in temperate for-
est area in Europe (Zuidema et al., 1994).

supply takes the economic conditions into account and is lower
than the AAC (580-630 x 106 m3/yr; ibid). Comparison of
these values, or of the approximately 100 x 10° m3 of growing
stock in boreal forests (90 x 109 m3 tabulated in Table 15-3), to
the annual harvests of 750 x 106 m3, indicates that long-term
sustainable biological availability substantially exceeds the
prospective need for wood in the boreal zone.

"More than any others, the boreal forests are subject to periodic
damage from large-scale disturbances such as fire, long-term
drought, windstorm, and insect infestations. Even chronic and
uniform climate warming is likely to cause increasing frequen-
cies of irregular, large-scale, and widespread catastrophic distur-
bance events in which large areas of forest are destroyed in a sin-
gle growth season. Recovery from these events may take cen-
turies (Payette et al., 1989), and the resulting availability of for-
est products as sanitation and salvage fellings will thus be very
irregular. Therefore, the shortcomings of the static vegetation
models described in Box 15-1 are very relevant to boreal forests.
"	Text
"The scenario analysis of Section 15.2 presents a dichotomy in
expectations for wood availability in the boreal zone. The cli-
mate-only scenarios (Table 15-1) assumed that agriculture
occupies 50% of the land permitted by its climatic potential,
boreal forest displaces nonforested tundra, and temperate veg-
etation replaces much of the current lower-latitude range of
boreal forests. This scenario suggests that boreal forest areas
will shrink between 20 and 50%, depending on the climate
change scenario used, by the time a doubling of GHGs occurs
sometime in the next century. The scenario driven primarily by
land use (Table 15-2) included agricultural land area that was
linked to a declining population and demand for food, and
allowed little climate-induced change in forest geography,
except in the few areas that shifted out of agricultural produc-
tion. That scenario suggested that boreal forests would increase
in area by 10 or 11% by the year 2050.

"Chapter 1 and Section 15.2 both discuss expected changes in
climate and responses by natural forest ecosystems. In a
warmer and drier boreal zone, it is likely that geographic
boundaries of boreal forest ecosystems will shift (Emanuel et
al., 1985a, 1985b; Solomon, 1992; Smith and Shugart, 1993).
While the forest ecosystems adapt to climate changes, ecosys-
tems will be in disequilibrium as existing species are replaced
by new species more adapted to the environment. Soil condi-
tions that lack the requirements of invading species in many
areas will exacerbate this condition. The area of forest affected
will greatly depend on the magnitude and rate of the climate
change. A likely result of any future climate change is that dur-
ing the next 50 years the wood availability in the boreal zone
will increase. However, it should be pointed out that forest
management and protection may have to be intensified sub-
stantially during this period, which will be costly (Nilsson and
Pitt, 1991; Apps et al., 1993).

"In the long run (>50 years), effects of climate change on wood
availability could be significant as the availability of wood
from existing species runs out and new species are insuffi-

terms of the sustainable use of forests (i.e., of need, discussed
in Section 15.5.3), the scenario estimates of availability until
2050 and those that would result from quantification of climate
change effects both suggest an excess of availability over need.
However, it is also important to emphasize that a significant
portion of harvested supply in the future could evolve from
irregular, widespread, and catastrophic mortality events that
cannot be simulated or predicted by current modeling methods.

"In the short term, timber supplies from all zones can be readi-
ly assured in intensively managed forests. The use of forest
plantations to mitigate increasing atmospheric CO, and to gen-
erate fuels from biomass is a subject of Chapter 24.
Unfortunately, past intensive management, especially fire sup-
pression and tree selection at species and intra-specific levels,
has created forests that now may be more vulnerable to fire,
pests, and pathogens (Schowalter and Filip, 1993), although
others dispute that conclusion. Given the current degree of
uncertainty over future climates and the subsequent response
of forest ecosystems, adaptation strategies (those enacted to
minimize forest damage from changing environment) entail
greater degrees of risk than do mitigation measures (those
enacted to reduce the rate or magnitude of the environmental
changes). Emerging principles of risk assessment and manage-
ment should guide the choice and implementation of “no-
regrets,” “proactive,” and “reactive” options for adaptation
(Gucinski and McKelvey, 1992).

"In summary, the conclusions from scenario analysis about bore-
al timber availability and need that begin Section 15.5 appear to
be very unrealistic. First, timber availability may be more
strongly affected by environmental changes in boreal regions
than in other zones: increased mortality and slowed forest suc-
cession from rapidly warming climate and large-scale distur-
bances; and enhanced growth from warmer growing season
temperatures and increased atmospheric CO,. These variables
are not simulated by the models that produced the scenarios in
Section 15.2. Second, boreal forest timber need is controlled by
trade in forest products outside the zone. Hence, economic con-
siderations drive need and its subsequent implementation—that
is, harvest of timber. The models underlying the scenarios in
Section 15.2 contain no consideration of forest economic or
trade processes or implications, and therefore are not capable of
realistic analysis of boreal forest product need in the future. The
economics of wood consumption and the analysis of temperate
and tropical zone timber needs, discussed in Sections 15.3 and
15.4, suggest that serious shortfalls of boreal industrial round-
wood could occur during the twenty-first century. This would
result if future temperate and tropical zone consumption of
boreal softwoods expands beyond available wood capacities.

"New research products needed to conduct an accurate assess-
ment of socioeconomic impacts of forest responses to climate
change have become obvious from the foregoing analysis. The
assessments are, and will be, based on quantitative scenarios of
changing availability of and need for forest products and ameni-
ties. Validity of scenarios is critical if they are to function as
descriptions of the implications of current knowledge for future
conditions. In all regions, scenarios were inadequate because
the effects of increasing CO, and forest dieback could not be
quantified. In tropical regions, the scenarios were deemed inad-
equate because they probably underestimated the regional and
local importance of land use on timber availability. In temper-
ate regions, the scenarios were incapable of quantifying the
buffering effects on timber needs, offered by shifting technolo-
gy aimed at product substitution and on availability by intense
mechanical management of forests. In boreal regions, the sce-
narios excluded transient responses of timber availability to
environmental change and extraregional responses of timber
needs by economic processes, which replace local forest prod-
uct demand there. All regions probably will undergo changes
that could not be expected only from the variables considered in
this assessment. Thus, research required for an adequate assess-

"warming (see Chapter 1), and land clearance for tropi-
cal agriculture. Extensive sanitary felling can produce
large volumes of timber, reducing revenue per unit of
wood and reducing incentives for intensive manage-
ment, while disrupting future timber availability.
Changing Harvesting Method—Harvesting and
even site preparation may be quite dependent on cold
winters in northern regions where forests occur on
predominantly swamp lands that can only be accessed
when frozen (Pollard, 1987). Use of ecosystem pro-
tection approaches (e.g., Franklin, 1989; Clark and
Stankey, 1991) can be particularly useful in light of
multiple-use needs in temperate and boreal regions
and the need for mixes of species and ages in all zones
to prepare for several different outcomes of environ-
mental change.

Shortening Rotations—Reduction of rotation age is
a simple tactic for reducing exposure of maturing tim-
ber stocks to deteriorating conditions, as well as
increasing opportunities for modifying the genetic
makeup of the forest. Gains may be offset by dimin-
ished timber quality, a lower mean annual increment,
and impacts on other values such as certain game
species and aesthetic qualities. Short-rotation planta-
tions in tropical regions are an important option in
meeting local fuelwood needs, coincidentally reliev-
ing pressure to harvest more pristine forests.
Increased Thinning—The stimulation of tree vigor
following stand thinning has special application under
increasing moisture deficits. The modification of for-
est microclimate by thinning offers considerable
potential for the management of pests (Amman, 1989;
Filip et al.. 1992: Paine and Baker. 1993).

that could provide regional estimates of the climatic change
implied by increasing GHG concentrations. The existing cli-
mate models are not able to generate reliable estimates on
regional temperature, precipitation, and hydrology. Yet much
of the forest response that is relevant to socioeconomic assess-
ment varies significantly from one locale or region to another.
In addition, in order to assess the quantitative implications of
ecophysiological processes under chronic climatic change, cli-

"The analyses generated for this assessment repeatedly demon-
strated the absolute necessity for development of models
describing transient responses of forests to rapid environmen-
tal change. Indeed, as Box 15-1 indicates, the problem to be
assessed involves impacts of rapidly changing climate during
the next century, not stable climate, and involves variously
lagged forest response variables, not responses in lock-step
with climate change. We lack models of vegetation response to
climate that incorporate the real drivers of future vegetation
dynamics: Transient processes involving differential rates of
mortality, establishment, and growth; climate control of forest
establishment and succession; absence and slow introduction
of seeds of trees from provenances, varieties, and species
appropriate for the available climate; and so on. For this “tran-
sient” assessment, the static model estimates of forest growth
over the next 50 to 75 years are woefully inadequate.

"	Title
"Any effects of climate change on fisheries will occur in a sec-
tor that already is characterized on a global scale by full uti-
lization, massive overcapacities of usage, and sharp conflicts
between fleets and among competing uses of aquatic ecosys-
tems. Climate-change impacts are likely to exacerbate existing
stresses on fish stocks, notably overfishing, diminishing wet-
lands and nursery areas, pollution, and UV-B radiation. The
effectiveness of actions to reduce the decline of fisheries
depends on our capacity to distinguish among these stresses
and other causes of change. This capacity is insufficient and,
although the effects of environmental variability are increas-
ingly recognized, the contribution of climate change to such
variability is not yet clear.
"	Text
"Globally, under-the IPCC scenarios, saltwater fish-
eries production is hypothesized to be about the same,
or significantly higher if management deficiencies are
corrected. Also, globally, freshwater fisheries and
aquaculture at mid- to higher latitudes could benefit
from climate change. These conclusions are depen-
dent on the assumption that natural climate variabili-
ty and the structure and strength of wind fields and
ocean currents will remain about the same. If either
changes, there would be significant impacts on the
distribution of major fish stocks, though not on glob-
al production (Medium Confidence).

Even without major change in atmospheric and
oceanic circulation, local shifts in centers of produc-
tion and mixes of species in marine and fresh waters

"While overfishing has a greater effect on fish stocks today than
does climate change, progress is being made on the overfishing
problem. Overfishing results from an institutional failure to

- adjust harvesting ability to finite and varying fish yields.
Conventional management paradigms, practices, and institu-
tions—inherited from the period when fish stocks were plenti-
ful—are not appropriate for the new situation of generally full
exploitation, especially of important fish stocks. Although the
Law of the Sea represents an important step in the proper direc-
tion, only a few countries have adopted the institutional
arrangements needed to regulate the access of fishing fleets to
critical areas. The United Nations (UN) Conference on Highly
Migrating and Straddling Stocks and the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) Code of Conduct for responsible fisheries
are likely to accelerate the adoption and effective implementa-
tion of regulatory mechanisms. Should climate change develop
according to IPCC scenarios, it may become even more impor-
tant than overfishing over the 50- to 100-year period covered
by this 1995 climate assessment.

"are expected as ecosystems are displaced geographi-
cally and changed internally. The relocation of popu-
lations will depend on properties being present in the
changing environments to shelter all stages of the life
cycle of a species (High Confidence).

While the complex biological relationships among
fisheries and other aquatic biota and physiological
responses to environmental change are not well under-
stood, positive effects such as longer growing seasons,
lower natural winter mortality, and faster growth rates
in higher latitudes may be offset by negative factors
such as a changing climate that alters established repro-
ductive patterns, migration routes, and ecosystem rela-
tionships (High Confidence). Changes in abundance
are likely to be more pronounced near major ecosystem
boundaries. The rate of climate change may prove a
major determinant of the abundance and distribution of
new populations. Rapid change due to physical forcing
will usually favor production of smaller, low-priced,
opportunistic species that discharge large numbers of
eggs over long periods (High Confidence). However,
there are no compelling data to suggest a confluence of
climate-change impacts that would affect global pro-
duction in either direction, particularly because rele-
vant fish population processes take place at regional or
smaller scales for which general circulation models
(GCMs) are insufficiently reliable.

Regionally, freshwater gains or losses will depend on
changes in the amount and timing of precipitation, on
temperatures, and on species tolerances. For example,
increased rainfall during a shorter period in winter still
could lead to reduced levels in summer in river flows,
lakes, wetlands, and thus in freshwater fisheries (see
Chapter 10). Marine stocks that reproduce in freshwa-
ter (e.g., salmon) or require reduced estuarine salinities
will be similarly affected (High Confidence).

Where ecosystem dominances are changing, econom-
ic values can be expected to fall until long-term sta-
bility (i.e., at about present amounts of variability) is
reached (Medium Confidence). National fisheries will
suffer if institutional mechanisms are not in place that
enable fishing interests to move within and across
national boundaries (High Confidence). Subsistence
and other small-scale fishermen, lacking mobility and
alternatives, often are most dependent on specific
fisheries and will suffer disproportionately from
changes (Medium Confidence).

Because natural variability is so great relative to glob-
al change, and the time horizon on capital replacement

"Adaptation options providing large benefits irrespec-
tive of climate change follow (Medium Confidence):

Design and implement national and international
fishery-management institutions that recognize
shifting species ranges, accessibility, and abun-
dances and that balance species conservation with
local needs for economic efficiency and stability
Support innovation by research on management
systems and aquatic ecosystems

Expand aquaculture to increase and stabilize
seafood supplies, help stabilize employment, and
carefully augment wild stocks

In coastal areas, integrate the management of fish-
eries with other uses of coastal zones

Monitor health problems (e.g., red tides, ciguatera,
cholera) that could increase under climate change
and harm fish stocks and consumers.

"(e.g., ships and plants) is so short, impacts on fisheries
can be easily overstated, and there will likely be rela-
tively small economic and food supply consequences
so long as no major fish stocks collapse (Medium
Confidence).

An impact ranking can be constructed. The following
items will be most sensitive to environmental vari-
ables and are listed in descending order of sensitivity
(Medium Confidence):

Freshwater fisheries in small rivers and lakes, in
regions with larger temperature and precipita-
tion change

Fisheries within Exclusive Economic Zones
(EEZs), particularly where access-regulation
mechanisms artificially reduce the mobility of
fishing groups and fleets and their capacity to
adjust to fluctuations in stock distribution and
abundance

Fisheries in large rivers and lakes

Fisheries in estuaries, particularly where there are
species without migration or spawn dispersal
paths or in estuaries impacted by sea-level rise or
decreased river flow

"Competition occurs at all levels: countries fishing the same

"World fisheries are characterized by a general state of full or
overexploitation of wild stocks and excess harvesting and pro-
cessing capacities. Some small pelagics, some very-deepwater
fish, and some oceanic tunas and Antarctic krill are among sev-
eral exceptions. Globally, fishing costs are about 20% greater
than revenues, with much of the deficit provided by national
subsidies (FAO, 1992a). The World Bank (1992) and FAO
(1992b) estimate total economic rent and subsidy losses at $79
billion annually, and the situation is likely to worsen.
"	Text
"Access to high-seas, highly migratory, and straddling (EEZ/high
seas) stocks remains mostly open and free, although participants
in some fisheries voluntarily limit catches. Without manage-
ment, fishing cannot be adequately adjusted to average stock
abundances, let alone to fluctuations. The 1995 UN Conference
on Highly Migrating and Straddling Stocks and the FAO Code
of Conduct for responsible fisheries are likely to accelerate the
adoption and effective implementation of regulatory mecha-
nisms. With effective management, depleted fisheries could
yield another 20 million tons annually (Weber, 1994).
"	Text
"With the advent of EEZs in the mid-1970s, foreign fleets
received allocations of stocks that exceeded domestic capaci-
ties. Domestic capacity then rapidly increased, often via joint-
venture (JV) partnerships with foreign companies. Upon
reaching full domestic exploitation through direct replacement
and domestic-controlled charters, most JVs were phased out.
JVs have not disappeared, however, and foreign fishing con-
tinues in some developing regions. Less desirable species and
areas or certain species taken by specialized fleets working
both international waters and EEZs are most of what remain
available to foreign licensed fleets.

"The productivity of freshwaters and sea margins has become
stressed by human density and societal actions to benefit non-
fisheries sectors. For example, freshwater diversions for agri-
cultural use have resulted in water-level and salinity changes,
leading to ecological disasters in the Aral, Azov, and Black
seas, and San Francisco Bay (Caddy, 1993; Mee, 1992;
Rozengurt, 1992). The artificial opening of the sand barrier at
the mouth of the Cote d’Ivoire River to clear floating weeds
allowed seawater to enter the lower part of the river and has
changed species dominances (Bard et al., 1991; Albaret and
Ecoutin, 1991).

"With few exceptions, governments have not recognized the cus-
tomary use-rights of traditional fishing communities. Growing
demands for fish, water, and space; encroachment by large-
scale fishing and aquaculture operations; population concentra-
tions; urban expansion; pollution; and tourism already have
harmed small-scale fishing communities in shallow marine
waters, lakes, and rivers. These fishers have limited occupa-
tional or geographic mobility. With climate change, global and
regional problems of disparity between catching power and the
abundance of fish stocks will worsen—particularly the interac-
tion between large mobile fleets and localized fishing commu-
nities. Aquaculture will develop in new areas, sometimes assist-
ing, sometimes disrupting existing artisanal fishers.
"	Text
"This situation is rooted in the ocean’s finite production capac-
ity and in the deficiencies (including concepts and enforce-
ment) of current institutions for adjusting fishing capacities to
stock productivity. Present systems were developed when
underutilized stocks were available and freely accessible to
large-scale fishing operations. Most have not been adjusted to
the situation of resource scarcity. Adoption of the UN
Convention on Law of the Sea and Exclusive Economic Zones,
generally out to 200 miles, has led most countries to control
foreign fleets and is a critical step toward improved institu-
tions. However, few countries have taken steps to improve
domestic management, even though 90% of production comes
from EEZs (Sherman and Gold, 1990; FAO, 1993).

"Marine fishing generates about 1% of the global econonty, but
coastal and island regions are far more dependent on fishing.
About 200 million people worldwide depend on fishing and
related industries for livelihood (Weber, 1994). Marine fish
account for 16% of animal protein (5.6% of total) consump-
tion, but developing countries are more dependent on this pro-
tein source (Weber, 1993, 1994). Marine catches peaked in
1989 at 85 million tons; freshwater catches were 6.4 million
tons, about 7% of the total (FAO, 1993). The potential sustain-
able yield of marine food fish may be about 100 million tons
(Russell and Yonge, 1975); the limit may have been reached.
Some 40% of total world production enters international trade
(FAO, 1992a), with the top fishing nations being China, Japan,
Peru, Chile, Russia, and the United States (FAO, 1993).

"The quantity of landings is declining (Garcia and Newton,
1994) in 13 of the 15 major marine areas. Only Indian Ocean
fisheries continue to increase. Further, there is a deterioration
in quality caused by declines in the sizes of highly valued
species and a move to bulk landings of lower-value species
(Regier and Baskerville, 1986). Thirty percent of global fish-
ery catches are discarded because they are too small, they are
prohibited from being landed, or no profitable market exists
(Alverson, 1994). This practice of discarding by-catch is more
common in industrial fisheries than artisanal ones. Most
important stocks are fully or overexploited (Sissenwine and
Rosenberg, 1993). In most regions, there is little or no surplus
biomass to buffer climate-induced fluctuations in stock abun-
dance relative to current demand. Reduced numbers of year
classes also increase stock variability and risk of collapse.

"Scientists are unable, in most instances, to quantify efficiently
each of the man-made and natural stresses on fish stocks. This
major constraint on integrated management of water bodies is
exemplified by the U.S. fishery for yellowtail flounder on
Georges Bank at the southern edge of the species range. The
species does not do well when the waters are warm. If there is
warming and efforts to rebuild the stock in U.S. waters suffer,
it will be difficult to differentiate climate change from fishing
as the primary cause (Anthony, 1993).
"	Text
"National and international trends appear to lead to more ratio-
nal means of management and improved institutions. Among
the more advanced concepts is that of Individual Transferable
Quotas (ITQs)—in which a science-based catch quota is set
and enforced, and fishers can buy and sell percentages of the
quota. ITQ systems are being implemented in many areas.
Most major fisheries in New Zealand, Canada, Chile, and
Iceland; several in Australia; and two in the United States are
under ITQ arrangements, with others under discussion
(Sissenwine and Rosenberg, 1993).

"populations that once thrived and provided food for the region
have collapsed with the decline in local primary production
that depended on the strong surges of flood waters and their
pulses of nutrients (Sharp, 1994). Where the Sahelian drought
is causing increased salinity in the lower parts of Senegalese
rivers, a dam erected near the mouth of the Senegal to stop the
rising salinity and ease severe problems to local agriculture
prevents fish migration (Binet et al., 1995). Hydroelectric
dams in the Dneiper River basin have suppressed spring flows,
increased salinities, and left local marshes unflooded at the
time of peak fish migration, decreasing fish landings by a fac-
tor of five (Mann, 1992).

"Climate change will add to stresses now affecting large lakes and their fisheries. Lake Victoria has reached ecological
devastation. Surrounded by urban and agricultural development, it suffers from high nutrient loading, causing eutrophica-
tion. Deforestation and erosion are putting sediments into the waters; papyrus swamps are declining with overharvesting;
and snails are increasing in abundance. Landing beaches and piers are useless as water continues to recede from the
shore. Exposed sand is being harvested, leading to the destruction of spawning grounds and fish refugia. Additionally,
introduction of Nile perch contributed to the upset of the productive natural ecosystem and the socioeconomic balance of
the region, as summarized below (Barel et al., 1985; Ssetongo and Welcomme, 1985; Acers, 1988; Ogutu-Ohwayo,
1990a, 1990b; Bruton, 1990; Achieng, 1990; Kaufman, 1992):

"The former multispecies fishery has been reduced to three species, due largely to predation by Nile perch and
overfishing. Two hundred species have become extinct.
The decline of perch prey forebodes the collapse of that fishery.

_ Subsistence fishers are unable to capitalize to compete in the new fishery. Surviving fishers have adapted by
using large-mesh nets to catch perch.’
The local population prefers the native species, as reflected in the low value of perch.
Perch cannot be sun-dried and must be smoked, requiring extensive use of firewood and leading to deforestation
of some islands.
The most important freshwater fishes in East Africa have vanished from the marketplace.
"	List
"Problems are markedly more acute in smaller water bodies and
fragile coral reefs, especially in areas of high human density.
In these areas, habitat degradation often is more important than
overfishing. As stresses intensify, impacts that for a long time
were limited to freshwaters and littoral areas are now observed
in closed and semi-enclosed seas (FAO, 1989b; Caddy, 1993).
Some semi-enclosed seas, such as the Mediterranean, Black,
Aegean, and Northern Adriatic, are already eutrophic. The
diversity of uses in these areas also has introduced “one of the
most pervasive and damaging anthropogenic impacts on the
world’s ecosystem” in the form of nonindigenous species
(Mills et al., 1994). Many of these organisms already have
extensive invasion histories, are easily transportable, are high-
ly fecund, and tolerate a wide range of environmental condi-
tions. Their damaging effects on indigenous populations may
only be enhanced by ecosystem fluctuations accompanying
climate change.

"Advancements are unevenly distributed across regions, farming
systems, and communities. Growth is about 5% annually. The
marine component is growing rapidly, but freshwater is still

"The total Soviet catch was unaffected by these depressed stocks. Fuel was inexpensive, and the fishing fleet moved to

duction and efficiency of fish farming (Fischetti, 1991).
However, fishers and resource managers are very concerned
about accidental or intentional release of altered and intro-
duced species that might harm natural stocks and gene pools.
Around Scandinavia, escapees and nonindigenous reproduc-

wild stocks (Ackefors et al., 1991). Introduction of pathogenic
organisms and antibiotic resistant pathogens is also of concern.

"The first indications of reaction by fish species to climate
change probably will be among those populations living at the
extremes of their temperature tolerance ranges (Holmes, 1990)
or residing in streams with high rates of heat transfer from the
air. In freshwater, population migration may be limited by
watershed constraints (Regier and Holmes, 1991; Shuter and
Post, 1990). In large drainage systems, the flexibility for
migratory shifts to compatible temperatures will be greater in
north-south flowing systems (Meisner, 1990).

"GCM results can be used to make some global inferences, but
caution must be used in forecasting fisheries impacts until sci-

water and nutrient flows, water level, biogeochemistry, sedi-

UV-B radiation. Changes in amounts, structures, and timing
will affect ecosystem components, including habitats, entire
food webs, and species interactions. Chapters 8, 9, and 10

"Large-scale systems specialize in a few high-value species
(e.g., shrimp and salmon) and are developing wherever prof-
itable, Small-scale systems (e.g., for freshwater finfish and
shellfish) are restricted to regions where aquaculture and/or
settled agriculture have existed for centuries (essentially in
eastern and southern Asia and in Europe). This distribution
reflects social and institutional factors (notably land and water
property regimes) that change very slowly. The need for
improved management is great. In Taiwan, for example, inad-
equate control of expansion of shrimp farming resulted in mass
mortalities of stocks and the collapse of production in 1987-89

"Luka et al. (1991) considered causes of depression of Barents Sea fish stocks and options for recovery. In the late 1970s,
total catches reached 4.5 million tons. Then, due to a decreasing abundance of cod, catches dropped, especially sharply
in the early 1980s. In the second half of the 1980s, after the fishery on capelin ended, the total catches were about
300,000 tons. The main cause was overfishing, but the unfavorable climatic regime (cooling in 1977-1982) led to poor
year classes of all main species. Fishing was very heavy in the 1970s and the first half of the 1980s, despite a declining
biomass (Kovtsova et al., 1991; Zilanov et al., 1991). By the second half of the 1980s, herring, capelin, and polar cod—
the main food for cod and haddock—were very scarce. This led to slow growth, starvation, and increased mortality.
Moreover, predation of cod and haddock on juveniles of deepwater redfish, plaice, and wolffish increased greatly, reduc-
ing some strong year classes before they entered the fishery (Kovtsova et al., 1991).

"Fish cannot regulate their internal temperatures; they try to maintain preferred temperatures through behavior. They seek
habitat close to the optimum temperature for growth, foraging success, and protection (Magnuson et al., 1979). Unless a
water body has such temperatures for substantial space and time—with other factors also sufficient for well-being—a
particular species will not likely thrive (Christie and Regier, 1988). Species have different preferred temperatures, with
similarities between species within families. In the figure below (from Lin, 1994), with optimal food and other factors,
two salmonid species prefer cold water at or below 25 °C; two percid species prefer cool waters; and two centrarchid
species prefer warm waters and tend to “hibernate” in winter when water temperatures fall below 8°C.

"Warming should produce a longer growing season for species
that have not attained their maximum temperature limits
(Shuter and Meisner, 1992), but warming also may lead to
reduced productivity in species at or near their maximum lim-
its (Mathews and Zimmerman, 1990). Greater fish production
should occur in high-latitude lakes and reservoirs (Schlesinger
and McCombie, 1983). Tropical lakes have longer growing
seasons and shorter generational times and usually produce
higher fish yields than temperate lakes because fish mature at
earlier ages. Mean annual air temperature is the most important
factor in predicting lake fish production across Iatitudes
(Schlesinger and Regier, 1982), but changing rainfall patterns
and flood regimes may have profound effects on river fish
(Meisner and Shuter, 1992; McDowall, 1992). In rivers, low
oxygen at low flows can severely limit fish production.

"About 70% of global fish resources depend on near-shore or estu-
arine habitats at some point in their life cycle (Chambers, 1991;
IPCC, 1990). The growing rate of human occupation—with asso-
ciated pollution—and the high property values of littoral areas,
especially in Western countries, will severely constrain the inland
displacement of wetlands and other habitats as sea leve! rises.
Fish production will suffer when wetlands and other habitats that
serve as nurseries are lost (Costa et al., 1994). Chapter 9 discuss-

"Changes in species dominance may occur. Each population has
adapted to specific temporal and spatial features. For example,
in New Zealand, native species occur throughout the nation,
whereas introduced species seem to be temperature-limited in
their distribution—suggesting that indigenous species may be
more resilient than exotics in a warming climate (New
Zealand, 1990). Species invasions and removals occur fre-
quently, even without human causes, but climate and habitat
change should accelerate them. Indigenous species will be sub-
ject to greater pressures from shifts in ecosystem structures and
introductions of opportunistic exotics (Lodge, 1993).

"The linkage between climate and marine fisheries is complex
and poorly understood. Physical changes influence recruitment
and abundance, the center of distribution and range, and avail-
ability by concentrating stocks in fishable locations. There are
sO many interacting variables (such as currents, upwelling,
cloudiness, nutrient flows, salinity, temperature, and solar irra-
diance) that predictions of changes in primary production are
not clear (Bernal, 1991; Mann and Lazier, 1991; see also the
Working Group I volume). However, understanding is grow-
ing. For instance, in the Pacific, the intensity of the Aleutian
low clearly affects primary production (Venrick et al., 1987;
Beamish and Bouillon, 1993) and ecosystem production
(Polovina et al., 1994).

"Alterations in seasonal climate patterns should change the pop-
ulation distributions in larger lakes. In a study using fish bioen-
ergetics models, certain Great Lakes fisheries were found to
have potentially greater yields, whereas others were predicted
to collapse (Hill and Magnuson, 1990). White perch—a species
of low value—might be among those with increased range and
improved recruitment because of a longer growing season and
shorter, milder winters (Johnson and Evans, 1990). Yields in
southern Lake Michigan and central Lake Erie are projected to
remain about the same for lake trout and lake whitefish but
increase for walleye. Thermal habitats are expected to increase
except for cold-water species in Lake Erie, where the deep
water could become anoxic in summer (Magnuson et al., 1990).
Large lake fish production could increase about 6% with a 1°C
rise in average annual air temperature (Meisner ef al., 1987).

"Positive factors associated with greater warming and precipita-
tion at higher latitudes include faster growth and maturation
rates, lower winter mortality rates due to cold or anoxia, and
expanded habitats with ice retreat. Offsetting negative factors
include increased summer anoxia, increased demands for food
to support higher metabolism, possible negative changes in
lake thermal structures, and reduced thermal habitat for cold-
water species. Individual effects are difficult to integrate.
However, warm-water lakes generally have higher productivi-
ty than cold-water lakes, and existing warm-water lakes will be
in areas with the least change in temperature. It is reasonable to
expect higher overall productivity from freshwater systems.
Most warming should occur during fall, winter, and nighttime
during the summer, improving the survival of fish that are less
tolerant of cold and having little effect on many species near
their upper lethal temperature. Streams may be no more likely
to reach high lethal temperatures. Lastly, fishery managers
heavily manipulate freshwater fisheries in much of the world.
If species mixes continue to be changed to support angler and

damages may dampen and benefits may heighten.

"If sea-level rise is too rapid, natural succession of coastal
ecosystems cannot occur, harming many species. With a half-
meter rise by 2100—and with protection of all developed
areas—more than 10,360 km? of wetlands could be lost in the
contiguous United States (Park et al., 1989). In the near term,
fish production could rise as marshes fragment, flood, die, and
decompose, improving fisheries habitat in some cases as the
protective land edge increases. More nutrients would become
available from leaching of soils and flooded peat. The south-
eastern United States, where land subsidence compounds sea-
level rise, may be in this phase of temporary improvement now
(Zimmerman et al., 1991), Eventually, detritus-based food
webs would lose the protective habitat and nourishment, as
well as wildlife nesting sites and refuge (Kennedy, 1990). In
the longer term, by 2050 the overall impact on fisheries will
probably be negative. The brown shrimp catch in the U.S, Gulf
Coast could fall 25% with a 25-cm rise in sea level (Park,
1991). A 34-cm rise could cause the loss of 40% of the exten-
sive Puget Sound tidal flats—an important habitat for shellfish
and waterfowl (Park et al., 1993). In certain areas, already
nutrient-rich waters may become eutrophic (Caddy, 1993).
Rising sea level may particularly affect coastal ponds as flood-
ing septic systems increase nutrient loading, an important load-
ing mechanism (Valiela and Costa, 1988).

"The main species harvested from the Caspian are sturgeon, roach, bream, sander, sazan, herring, and kilkas (Anon.,

low-water years, with reduction of sea area and volume and higher salinities. Roach, bream, sander, and juveniles of all
other species declined as their prey decreased in response to the water changes. At the same time, river fish (sheatfish,

surface and subsurface waters will increase, improving their
nutrient contents but perhaps delaying the phytoplankton

whereas wind acceleration along the Mauritania coast favored
settlement of a new sardine population (Binet, 1988a), possibly
illustrating a dome-shaped environment-resource relationship

"A general poleward extension of habitats and range of species

fished up to the North Sea. During the 1970s, new fisheries
developed off the Sahara and Mauritania, with small amounts

ecological processes related to tradewind acceleration (Binet,

changes in the larval advection/retention rates in and out of
favorable areas and may explain changes in abundance and dis-

"Warmer water and changes in circulation would substantially

to temperature-dependent physiological and ecological rates
and behavioral thresholds (Lin and Regier, 1995). While the

large expanses of the near-shore environment (c.f, Pauly et al., 1987, 1989; Yafiez, 1991).

Recent changes in the distribution and abundance of west African pelagic stocks correlate with upwelling sys-

tem modifications (Binet and Marchal, 1992, 1993; Binet and Servain, 1993; Cury and Roy, 1991):

—  Ashortened food web resulted in more phytoplankton and fewer zooplankton, benefiting phytoplankton-
feeders.

— New concentrations of Sardinia pilchardus appeared off Mauritania and Senegal; pilchard catches declined
off northern Morocco.

—  Sardinella aurita strongly expanded in the Ivory Coast.

Similar stock changes are documented from Namibia and South Africa (Crawford et al., 1991; Payne et al.,

1987), Argentina and Brazil (Bakun and Parrish, 1990, 1991), California (Parrish and McCall, 1978), Peru/Chile

(Pauly and Tsukayama, 1987; Sharp and McLain, 1993), and the subarctic Pacific (Beamish and Bouillon, 1993).

changes in their environment. Some even have fully diversified
local population responses that would seem unlikely. Shad along
the eastern United States spawn many batches of smaller eggs in
their warmer southern range and, in the less variable north, pro-
duce larger eggs that they carry up rivers and spawn in single

number of larger and older fish in the population (Bagenal,
1970). Although some species can rebuild quickly (Beamish,
1993), most large species will have difficulty taking advantage
of a favorable environmental episode that may come only once
in several years. Overfishing also may reduce the genetic
resilience of the population, with similar consequences. Climate
changes may magnify the effects of overfishing at a time of an
inherent instability in world fisheries (Stokes et al., 1993).

changes. Fish have developed many patterns of behavior to
deal with climate variability and migrating predators and prey.
Some environments call for tightly constrained windows with-
in which reproduction can succeed. Others require constant or
prolonged spawning to cope with even finer-grained, less-cer-
tain opportunities. Because many fish early-life stages occur in
shallow layers and estuaries where various climate components
are important (Kawasaki, 1985), there is potential for signifi-

"There may be a synergistic effect between climate change and
overfishing. With overfishing, the age composition of a stock
becomes increasingly unbalanced: Fewer year classes and
mature individuals are available, and fewer reproductive
opportunities occur. Overfishing eliminates species character-
ized by low fecundity, slow growth, and late sexual maturation,
while favoring species with opposite strategies, usually of less
economic value. It introduces new trophic pathways, possibly
produces empty ecological niches, and creates new competi-
tive relationships. For example, there has been a change in fish
sizes and species dominance in the Gulf of Biscay since 1800
(Quéro and Emmonet, 1993). Georges Bank also has been the
scene of a “biomass flip,” with skates and dogfish replacing
cod, haddock, and flounder (Rothschild, 1991).

"Hydrodynamic structures are largely determined by wind
fields, currents and fronts, temperature, salinity, and geograph-
ic topography. As new hydrographic structures stabilize, new .
populations may take advantage of the physical features.
Colonization is determined by ecological constraints affecting
reproduction (Sinclair, 1988). For species dependent on geo-
graphical features, there is less flexibility. For example, herring
spawning in certain areas disappeared with the collapse of spe-
cific herring populations in the 1970s but reappeared in the
same locations as the herring recovered (Daan et al., 1990).
Dislocations of and changes in density stratifications may

"Most Peruvian anchovy concentrations moved into
inshore waters after 1972: The percentage of catches
made within 10 miles rose from 42% before 1970 to
91% after 1972 (Valdivia, 1978) as the areal extent of
the upwelled water dwindled.

The route by which sockeye salmon return to the
Fraser River determines, in part, their availability to
Canada and U.S. fisheries. In warm years—and espe-
cially in strong El Nifio years (see Box 16-6)—80% of
returning sockeye may use a cooler, northern route that
favors Canadian fishing interests, compared to as little
as 10% in some cold years (Miller and Fluharty, 1992).
High salinity near the coast due to droughts can
reduce the area of low-salinity waters, increasing the
availability of some species to small-scale fisheries—
for example, Sardinella aurita in the northern Gulf of
Guinea, especially the Ghanaian canoe fishery (Binet,
1982), and Sardina pilchardus off northern Morocco
(Belvéze and Erzini, 1983).

Development of the Northeast Atlantic bluefin tuna
fishery from 1920 to 1967, with a peak in the 1950s,

North Atlantic until the late 1940s and subsequent

shifting fish distributions—comparable to what happens now
within natural climate variability. New fishing sites often have
poor or nonexistent provisions for freshwater supply, sanita-

less sanitary than is needed, and cholera or other diseases may
occur. Where there are no cold storage facilities, fishers may
have to resort to either salting or smoking as alternative means
for preservation. Such change can, in turn, lead to local defor-
estation, increased soil erosion, or loss of mangroves and
associated fish nursery habitat. Long-distance migrations of
small-scale fishers can be constrained by newly established
national frontiers or by confrontation between local fishers

"Environmental processes, fisheries management, and population dynamics closely interact. The 1972 El Nifio, coupled
with anchovy overexploitation and resultant recruitment failure, led to a severe crisis in the following years. Although not
the direct cause of the collapse (Sharp and McLain, 1993), the El Nifio, nested within a much broader set of environmen-
tal changes, concentrated the anchovies—enabling the fishery to operate on the entire population, which previously was
scattered over a broader area with some portions protected from continuous exploitation (Csirke, 1980). The anchovy
collapse was an economic disaster for Peru. The production center for the Humboldt Current shifted southward, from
north-central Peru to the Peru/Chile border, with sardines colonizing the coastlines from Ecuador to central Chile.

"There also are less familiar El Nifio impacts. Some can last for several years. For example, El Nifio Southern Oscillation
(ENSO) processes, combined with other natural variability, led to increased prices of salmon from 1980-1984, due to
displacenient of salmon migratory routes and complex ecological changes from warm-water intrusions along the Pacific
coast of North America. Pacific gray whales moved far north of their usual locations, indicating that their habitat had
moved northward and shoreward for the first time in decades (Sharp, 1994). The 1982-1983 El Nijfio led to increased
stocks and catches of scallops and oceanic tunas and billfishes in Chile and Peru. The annual migration of whiting along
the west coast of the United States and Canada is correlated with water temperature, especially with strong El Nifio con-
ditions. In warm years, more stock is available to Canadian fishers (Dorn and Methot, 1990). Temperate Sardinops popu-
lations in the Gulf of California are much less available during El Nifios, whereas tropical thread herring are much more
available (Lluch-Belda et al., 1986).

regions will require mord seaworthy vessels or other changes

"The ways in which societies have responded to past changes in
the fisheries that support important components of their region-
al economies are instructive in guiding society toward devel-
oping better ways of adapting to the regional impacts of envi-
ronmental change (Glantz, 1992). As an example, the industry
collapses of the Chilean/Peruvian anchovy, the California sar-
dine, and the Alaskan king crab led to varied socioeconomic
responses. While the less industrially capitalized Chileans
responded to perturbations in the anchovy catch with regula-
tions and an adaptive restructuring of the industry to the more
offshore jack mackerel (Trachurus murphyi) and secondarily
the sardine (Sardinops sagax), the Peruvians continued peak
extraction until the anchovy catch collapsed and only slowly
shifted to alternative fisheries, with serious economic impacts
(Caviedes and Fik, 1992). The California sardine bonanza, har-
vested at increasing levels for half a century, similarly col-
lapsed—with perhaps even greater socioeconomic impacts on
the region. When the industry collapsed in the 1960s, most of
the fleet converted to less labor-intensive fisheries or was sold
for pennies on the dollar; fishing and cannery crews, unneeded
in the remaining fisheries, moved north to Alaskan waters,
fished only seasonally, or left the industry; and much of the
infrastructure was moved to South America, along with the
expertise of many fishing captains and cannery operators
(Ueber and MacCall, 1992). The 1981 collapse of the Alaskan
king crab industry also resulted in economic disaster for the
heavily overcapitalized industry, which was faced with fore-
closure or diversification. The fleets that survived broadly
expanded their fishing grounds, shifted to replacement species
(other king crabs and Tanner crabs), or traded their former low-
volume/high-value fishery for more high-volume/lower-value
fisheries (e.g., pollock) (Wooster, 1992).

"The magnitude of effects depends on the importance
of fisheries in an economy. Although all sectors may
benefit from positive effects, the economies of tradi-
tional fishing groups and developing countries may be
disproportionately impacted by negative effects. With
little diversification, their means are limited and they
are more vulnerable, particularly in developing coun-
tries bounded by major upwelling regions (e.g.,
Mauritania, Namibia, Peru, Somalia) (Troadec,
1989a).

Small-scale fisheries, even in industrialized countries,
maintain several characteristics of premercantile soci-
eties, such as autonomy, self-sufficiency, exploitation
of local natural resources, self-limitation of demand,
geographic mobility (to offset the law of diminishing
returns), solidarity within family, and the original
value systems. Industrialized, market societies are
characterized by autonomy of individuals, profession-
al specialization, mobility of production factors, .
development of new activities through technological
innovations, and accumulation of profit. Because the
economy of these organizations is different, it is diffi-
cult to compare their capacity to cope with variability
and uncertainty; however, the former’s frequent lack
of means (poverty) is a major and new handicap.
When climate change shifts the distribution of a fish
stock within an EEZ, or between EEZs, or causes a
stock to simply change in abundance within its previ-
ous distribution, the resulting mismatch between fish
availability and fishing capacity will require greater
management flexibility, both nationally and interna-
tionally. Because natural variability is so great relative
to global change, and the time horizon on capital
replacement (ships and plants) is so short, in most sit-
uations, there will likely be relatively small economic
or food-supply consequences.

There are three major institutional deficiencies: the
allocation of access rights to fisheries and among
competing uses of aquatic resources; regional fish-
eries bodies whose mandate and organization have
not adjusted to the new requirements of shared and
straddling stocks management; and international
institutions whose development is lagging behind
the globalization of the economy and uses of the
ecosphere (Troadec, 1994).

Nearshore warming could result in increased production in

availability of nearly optimum air and water temperatures

warmer water, the economic incentive to develop cultivation of
temperate and subtropical species could develop. A decrease in
ice cover could substantially relax the geographic limits for
commercial operations for species such as salmonids, oysters,

world. This is a primary means for the introduction of new
cholera strains. Clams, mussels, and oysters can be carriers of

as food or export earnings are most sensitive. Examples of

"Most fish species are sensitive to the expected climate-
change effects. The individuals, or centers of production, can
shift rapidly if suitable habitat and paths exist. Fish species
are cold-blooded; life processes, such as growth, are faster
when warmer (within limits). Many species have narrow eco-
logical niches, but there are many species to fill niches. In a
varying environment, species mixes will change. Examples
of sensitivities are:

"There is no significant difference in the impacts of climate
change on recreational species as opposed to commercial or
subsistence species. Many species are pursued by multiple user
groups. However, increased storminess or changes in weather
patterns will affect the desirability and effort involved in recre-
ational fishing more than other types of fishing. Changes might
include shorter ice-fishing seasons and longer seasons for high-
er-latitude fisheries. On New Zealand’s west coast, expected
decreases in westerly winds, higher temperatures, and sea-level
rise may lead to a decline in the distribution and abundance of
toheroa, a popular shellfish species sought by aboriginal and
recreational fishermen (New Zealand, 1990).

"Arise in sea level will adversely affect infrastructure that sup-
ports fisheries. In less-industrialized areas—where artisanal
fishers land catches in numerous remote fishing villages and
transport them, often by foot, to commercial centers and tourist
motels for sale—a significant rise in sea level will drown much
of the existing network of roads and footpaths used by many
poor coastal people who financially and nutritionally depend
on their daily catch. Sea-level rise also will impact industrial-
ized countries, as implied in the Caspian Sea example (see Box
16-4). Reduction in fresh water supplies due to sea-level rise
and increased evaporation—where not offset by increased pre-
cipitation—could have significant impacts on fish processing,
which uses large amounts of potable water (Smit, 1993).
"	Text
"Modern industrial fisheries require complex support, includ-
ing electronic positioning, weather advisories, transportation,
cold storage, ports, processing, markets, electricity, potable
water, search and rescue, and provisioning. Any redistribu-
tion or increased variability of fishery resources, or of aqua-
culture production, adds strain on this sector. Natural vari-
ability is so great that the provision of these services is gen-
erally quite flexible. However, when long-term redistribu-
tions occur, economic efficiencies change as the distance
between fish and home ports changes. Over time, ports near-
er to new fishing areas will gain an advantage. Home ports
will change, families will move, and there will be winners
and losers. In some cases, the retail market may respond to
long-term redistributions, if the predominant species change
and the new species require different processing and market-
ing approaches. Rapid loss of shelf space in markets and
absence from restaurant menu listings occurs when species
are unavailable. It is difficult to regain these markets, further
exacerbating variability in revenues.

"The faster the rate of climate change, the more difficult will be
adjustments in human systems. Surprises and divergences from
the predicted scenarios are to be expected and must be antici-
pated by resource and community managers. Preparation for
the unexpected is important (New Zealand, 1990). In general,
technological innovations are developed faster than are those
of a biological or societal nature. Cultural attitudes, which are
critical for the adoption of institutional innovations, have the
greatest inertia.
"	Text
"Storms are also of major significance for the fisheries industry.
Increased storminess can damage fishery and aquaculture
infrastructure and lead to increased costs for the strengthening
of facilities. In some cases, increased storminess can lead to
longer fishing seasons if ice is broken up or cannot form.
Storms are a major threat to the safety of fishers. Increases in
intensity or frequency could lead to additional losses in the
occupation, which is already among the most dangerous; the
fatality rate of commercial fishing is seven times the U.S.
industry average (Hart and Perrini, 1984).
"	Text
"Changes in storm frequency and intensity could have subtle
and easily missed impacts in the coastal zone. For example, in
regions of small tidal range, such as the Gulf of Mexico, there
are wetlands found above the high-tide line that get inundated
by storms and weather fronts or distant oceanic events
(Swenson and Chuang, 1983). These high super-tidal wetlands
are important in supporting marine species. In some interior
areas, near and distant storms are the dominant flooding
mechanisms and affect the production of shrimp (Childers et
al., 1990).
"	Text
"Major storms such as cyclones have major consequences for
ecosystems. They cause mixing of ocean waters and internal
upwelling over the edges of shelf seas, moving nutrients and
organisms into the photic zone—which then helps local
food-web production and can be likened to terrestrial plow-
ing (Sharp, 1994). Such mixing, though, can disturb the
stratification of water masses and their biological compo-
nents, on which many species depend as part of their repro-
ductive strategies. Storms also can be disruptive to reefs,
mangroves, and shoreline habitats and to egg masses laid on
substrate. Storm paths are also important. Path changes can
affect the density of plankton forage on which young fish
depend, thus modifying the recruitment success of pelagic
stocks (Lasker, 1981).
"	Text
"There is a danger that if climate-change alterations are slow,
inexorable, and generally irreversible, impacts resulting from
climate change will not be recognized in time. Alternatively,
abrupt shifts in climate-influenced factors may be too limiting
for species acclimation or management adjustment. Some fish-
eries involve high capital investment, and others are very
important to whole coastal communities. To minimize eco-
nomic and social disruption, the possibility of permanent long-
term changes in the regional availability of traditional fish
stocks must be anticipated and new management philosophies
developed. Local fishery managers also need to anticipate and
take advantage of short-lived benefits (Sharp, 1991). As in any
stock management planning, managers must recognize the
need for flexible approaches and for greater foresight when
establishing policies.

"Management systems developed when resources were not
under intense fishing or environmental threat have become ill-
adapted to resource scarcity. In traditional systems, resource
access was regulated through the social structure of rural com-
munities. These systems lose their effectiveness as population
pressure and resource uses intensify. They are being supple-
mented by central legislation, with attendant lag times in
addressing problems. These formal regulatory systems have
also tended to become ineffective as the need for harvest
rationing increases. As resources approach their production
limits, administrators and producers have maintained the status
quo even at the cost of greater economic inefficiency and over-
fishing. To function most effectively, economic systems need
proper institutions (e.g., a market for pricing harvest rights), a
property or ownership/stewardship regime for the functioning
of that market, and an institutional context to administer the
proper functioning of any allocation system based on such
rights and markets.

which reduces risk due to climate uncertainty. There also is
risk-sharing within family businesses, extended families, and
communities, which compensates for temporary setbacks in a
particular fishery or enterprise. These may be formal or infor-
mal, involving cooperatives or financial institutions, based on
a sense of mutual support. The vulnerability of communities
to varying stocks, intense fishing pressure, and inappropriate
government policies is graphically apparent with the current
Canadian moratorium on northern cod, whose stock abun-
dance and distribution may be partly related to water temper-
ature and salinity (Smit, 1993; Mann and Drinkwater, 1994).
The policy lesson here is that government fisheries managers
should not lock fishing interests into narrow full-time activity
within a single fishery. Flexibility in fishing, plus seasonal
shifts to other sectors, will be a valuable approach to mini-
mizing climate-change impacts, as long as fishing capacity is
consistent with the resource base.

"In cases of species collapse and obvious ecosystem
disequilibrium, restock with ecologically sound
species and strains as habitat changes. Great care is
needed to avoid long-term ecological damage.
Consider, cautiously, the use of hatcheries to enhance
natural recruitment when climate causes stocks to fall
below the ecosystem carrying capacity for a given
species. Such enhancement might increase stock pro-
ductivity (per unit area), reduce recruitment variability
(e.g., Héral et al., 1989), and enable the colonization
or recolonization of new areas (¢.g., Peterman, 1991).
Conversely, injudicious use may alter or impoverish
the biodiversity and genetic pool of resources and pos-
sibly transmit parasites and diseases (Barg, 1992).
Research on identifying warm-water species with
wide temperature tolerances also could be useful.

"Warming will mean generally longer growing seasons
and increased rates of biological processes—and
often of production.

Warming will require greater attention to possible
oxygen depletion.

In some areas, the species grown may have to shift to
those more tolerant of warmer and perhaps less-oxy-
genated waters.

Coastal culture facilities may need to consider the
impacts of sea-level rise on facilities and the freeing
of contaminants from nearby waste sites.

Competing wild fisheries production (and indeed,
agriculture) may not vary much at the world level, but
there could be significant regional changes in quanti-
ty and species mix.

Precipitation, freshwater flows, and lake levels will
likely change. Strong regional variations are likely.
Warming waters could introduce disease organisms or
exotic or undesired species before compensating
mechanisms or intervention strategies have become
established.

Less ice cover and thinner ice will generally mean
less ice damage to facilities and a longer season for
production and maintenance.

Covering culture tanks, or keeping them indoors
under controlled light, may be needed more often to
protect larvae from solar UV-B.

Several of the above and other factors, such as com-
peting demand for coastal areas, may. argue for tech-
nological intensification in ponds and noncoastal

Modify and strengthen fisheries management policies

Preserve and restore wetlands, estuaries, floodplains,

Cooperate more closely with forestry, water, and other

all sectors affecting fisheries (e.g., water resources,
coastal management) needs to be examined to ensure

Be alert to possible increased health problems caused
by biotoxins and the release of pollutants from a rising
sea level; industry and seafood-safety agencies should
take the lead. Take measures to prevent the introduc-
tion of undesirable organisms as climate changes.
Tailor institutional innovations to ecological, techni-

different regulatory arrangements. There is no stan-

Adapt to fish redistribution with faster vessels,

Construct and maintain appropriate infrastructure for
storm forecasting, signaling systems, and safe refuges
for dealing with possible rising sea level and
increased storminess.

Take advantage of reduced need for ice strengthening
of vessels and infrastructures in a warmer climate,
except perhaps for areas with increased icebergs.
Foster interdisciplinary research, with scientists meet-

to ensure the proper interpretation of results and the

events and sea-level rise are material to both storm and flood
damage. The climatological literature does not supply suffi-

centers or “combined events,” like windstorms associated with
heavy rain and storm surges. This could critically alter the pat-
tern of insurance claims. Further, the industry is vulnerable to

and this is still obscure. Meteorological records are too short to

"There are several reasons for the escalation in the cost of
severe weather. Developed countries have become wealthier.
Many more people now live in coastal areas with costly infra-
structures. Personal goods and business processes are general-
ly more vulnerable to water damage. The built environment
also contributes through inappropriate or incorrect design and
construction. The insurance industry has compounded matters
by extending the basis of coverage. It is a common perception
in the insurance industry that there is a trend toward an
increased frequency and severity of extreme climate events.
The meteorological literature fails to substantiate this in the
context of long-term change, though there may have been a
shift within the limits of natural variability.
"	Text
"Within financial services, the property insurance industry is
most likely to be directly affected by climate change, since it
is already vulnerable to variability in extreme weather events.
The cost of weather-related disasters to insurers has risen
rapidly since 1960. For example, the annual insured cost of
major windstorms worldwide increased progressively from
$0.5 billion in the 1960s to more than $11 billion (constant
1990 dollars) in the early 1990s. This trend has led to restric-
tions in coverage or steep price increases. Where insurance is
unavailable or unaffordable, there are consequences for other
economic activities, as well as for consumers and government.
New enterprises may not start without insurance. Banks may
be exposed to losses where financial transactions are backed

by property.
"	Text
"Through its experience, the insurance sector can help authori-
ties to improve the response to property damage from extreme
events. Control of land use, particularly in floodplains and
coastal zones, is essential to prevent values at risk increasing.
Information about hazards can be mapped and appropriate
physical protections put in place. Necessary improvements to
construction design and processes can be identified and incor-
porated into new building and, if possible, also retrofitted.
Many countries now accept that it is not appropriate to account
for insurance against extreme events on an annual basis, since
funds need to be accumulated over a long period to meet infre-
quent but severe losses. Where it is not possible to provide pri-
vate insurance, the industry can still assist with disaster-recov-
ery services. This generally will prove to be a very efficient
method compared to other ad hoc approaches.

"The implications of climate change for financial services out-
side property insurance cannot be stated with any confidence.
Few institutions, if any, were aware of the potential implica-
tions when this assessment began. Yet changes in human health
may affect the life insurance and pension industries. Banking
may be vulnerable to repercussions from property damage.
Returns on long-term investments and capital projects may be
affected by mitigation measures that alter the economics of
whole industries—for example, shifting from carbon fuels to
renewable resources. The economies of selected regions, such
as coastal zones and islands, may be disadvantaged. Climate
change might affect client behavior, or even alter the available
portfolio of clients through the changing economics of differ-
ent industries. Outsiders will be keen to know how the finan-
cial sector deploys its funds in the light of climate change.
There is a need for increased recognition by the financial sec-
tor that climate change is an issue that could affect its future at
the national and international level. This could require institu-
tional change.

"This section deals with external factors that affect the whole
sector. The financial services sector falls into two broad clus-
ters—insurance and banking, which will be described in
Sections 17.3 and 17.7, respectively. It has evolved into a high-
ly complex system that recycles “money” among other parts of
the economy, including final consumption and capital invest-
ment. Governments participate to a varying degree through
public debt issues and other investments, and the process oper-
ates on timescales from days to decades. The definition used
here excludes foreign aid. Clearly, many countries have signif-
icant noncash economies; the discussion excludes those activ-
ities. Many of the costs of extreme events recorded by the
financial sector reflect impacts in other sectors. Although this
is in a sense “double-counting,” the financial sector transmits
these effects to other sectors and may indeed amplify them if it
is unable to fulfill other services through lack of capital.

"Many economies have been plagued by enormous surges in
property values, followed by stagnation or even collapse. This
makes it difficult to assess assets and liabilities. A second factor
that complicates the valuation of property is the generally high
rate of inflation between 1960 and 1990, A further difficulty is
fluctuating exchange rates in economies with unstable curren-
cies. Such instabilities have led to high interest rates and peri-
ods of rapid investment gains. These have diverted attention to
“cash flow” strategies (Swiss Re, 1991) and also have created
the possibility of insolvency through poor investments (Denlea,
1994), Another area of pressure on financial services is the need
to fund environmental claims—seen at its most energetic in the
United States, where the Superfund legislation has created huge
liabilities for the property-casualty industry (Nutter, 1994). The
banking industry also is threatened by “lender liability” as a
consequence of repossessing or taking control of polluted land
or a polluting operation (Vaughan, 1994).

"adopting “just in time” techniques. As society becomes more
dependent on electricity, any supply disruptions from extreme
events become potentially more catastrophic. Economic devel-
opment has been rapid, bringing with it wealth but also pollu-
tion. In many cases, development has occurred in vulnerable
locations (see Chapter 12). With the progression from primary
to tertiary activities, the impact of climate change on many
areas is likely to be indirect and thus more difficult to judge,
particularly because social change also has been rapid.
Population has burgeoned in many countries, and standards of
behavior have altered regarding fundamental issues like the
family, crime, and work (Kennedy, 1993). Consumerism and
environmentalism have developed strongly as education has
spread. Much financial services activity is “driven” by the pri-
vate automobile, financing its purchase and use. Therefore,
mitigating climate change by altering auto use would affect
financial services. On the other hand, current trends in auto use
cannot continue without putting enormous stress on society
(Northcott, 1991). The answer may be to exploit telecommuni-
cations as a substitute, but this is not certain.

"Property insurance is used to varying extents by different nations. Often, consumers are reluctant to purchase sufficient
coverage. Lack of capital, culture, and consumer attitude to risk play their parts. In other cases, insurers are unwilling t

Sections 17.3 through 17.6 consider property insurance and

Natural catastrophe—A 1982 French law attached natural catastrophe to all property policies at a centrally determined
set of surcharges on the basic premium. Claims are made only if the authorities declare a disaster. In 1990, the scheme

damage and the issue of uninsured property owners (Florin, 1990).

"The basic function of insurance is to transfer financial risk from
an individual to a group; what is a disaster to the individual can
often be managed by larger numbers. Typically, the individual
proposes his risk to the underwriter, often with the assistance of
an intermediary or broker. In some cases, the risk must be eval-
uated in great detail, and the insurer may stipulate certain
actions (risk management) to reduce the likelihood and scope of
potential loss. Finally, the insurer offers specific terms in a pol-
icy. The most important terms of the contract involve the price,
or premium; any exclusions of events or property not covered
by the contract; and limitations on the amount to be paid in a
claim. Contracts of insurance are usually renewable. Usually
the contract lasts for twelve months and is renegotiated with a

"view to changes in circumstances, particularly claims experi-
ence. Following acceptance of the risk, the insurer must then
decide whether to share it with reinsurers. The reinsurer may
further spread the risk by “retrocession” to other reinsurers, but
this has become less common. The other key activity is settling
claims. After a loss, the policyholder reports it to his insurer,
who will decide how much investigation is necessary. A loss
adjuster is often retained for this purpose. Claims recovery
often provides the occasion to implement risk-improvement
measures. Policies have become more comprehensive over
time, culminating in “all risks” coverage, where the policy stip-
ulates what is excluded. Other significant changes have been to
allow for inflation in property values by indexation, and to set
aside the effect of depreciation by using replacement values.
Finally, policies often allow for economic costs such as alterna-
tive accommodation if a claim results in temporary relocation.

1994). In fact, more and more disturbances can be associated
with the El Nifio Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon.
Alternatively, where data on extremes is lacking, similar condi-

"Natural hazards are dangerous because of the likelihood of an
accumulation of loss through damage to many individual prop-
erties (Nierhaus, 1986). Underwriters seek to estimate the max-
imum probable loss. In fact, any level of loss must have a finite
chance of being exceeded; Tiedemann (1991) points out that
under certain conditions, a 90% probability of being free from
an event for 100 years implies that the event occurs once in
1,000 years. Four methods of a risk assessment are described
by Friedman (1984): conventional pricing, two-tier pricing,
stage-damage, and simulation.

"There now are many applications of Friedman’s techniques:
storm surge (Stakhiv and Vallianos, 1993), flood (Smith,
1991), and European storms (Schraft et al., 1993). The insurer
can study the potential effect of historic events on today’s
exposure, model hypothetical events, assess the expected cost
of natural hazards for a portfolio, and estimate the probability
of exceeding some loss level. The financial effects of
deductibles or reinsurance can be measured (Boissonade and
Dong, 1993). An Applied Insurance Research study of hurri-
canes gave $53 billion for a class 5 hurricane hitting Miami
and $52 billion for a class 4 hitting New York (IRC, 1995). The
expected severity of the hazard often is codified by zoning ter-
ritory to control the amount of risk in any event (Nierhaus,
1986). The CRESTA (Catastrophe Risk Evaluating and
Standardized Target Accumulations) system for earthquakes
was invented by reinsurers (Foreman, 1989). A multi-peril
approach for Australia uses 52 zones for cyclone, thunder-
storm, wildfire, and earthquake (Flitcroft, 1989).

"industry generated premiums of $700 billion. The United States
accounts for 44% of the total, the European Union (EU) 29%
and Japan 12%, leaving the rest of the world with 15% (Swiss
Re, 1994b). These sums meet all claims: liability, accidental
damage, fire, and natural hazards, as well as administration
costs. Figures on capital are not readily available, but a com-
mercial insurer would generally maintain capital at 40-50% of
premiums, giving an equivalent of $280 to $350 billion. This
capital provides a reserve to meet all unexpected costs, not just
those from extreme weather events, and it is usually subject to
a legal minimum requirement (e.g., 17% of premium in the
EU). It is reinforced by reinsurers’ capacity, but again the capi-
tal is required for various classes of claims. The scale of the
commercial non-life reinsurance industry is hard to estimate.
Based on estimates by Foreman (1989) for the United States,
the net premium volume is probably about $100 billion, with
capital reserves about the same size. Two-thirds of the capital is
required to fund non-property business (Laderman, 1993), leav-
ing approximately $35 billion for natural catastrophes.

"Conventional pricing is experience-based but with a short
“memory,” giving a dubious allowance for disasters. Two-tier
pricing has a first element based on experience, but also a sec-
ond element specifically for disasters, set notionally. For stage-
damage, the property at hazard is characterized by its key
dimensions and vulnerability to different levels of event.
Detailed knowledge of the local terrain is then used to model
the likely impact on the property of a specific event. In simu-
lation, the portfolio of property is treated at an aggregate level,
and the likely damage is assessed by evaluating the damage
over a large number of extreme events intended to be typical of
the long-run distribution of severity and frequency. This
approach overcomes two problems: first, that there are not
many catastrophe events in practice, and second, that historic
damage reflects very different portfolios (Clark, 1986). The
third and fourth methods require considerable data.
Topography can affect the damage potential by more than
100% (Georgiou, 1989). Other difficulties are that it may not
be practical to keep a schedule of property; losses.to produc-
tion may be caused by events elsewhere; and one “event” may
strike several “target” locations (Meek and Tattersall, 1989).

"World population is increasingly concentrated in urban areas,
coastal regions, and river valleys (Marco and Cayuela, 1992).
The concentration of property in such areas exposes insurers to
potentially large losses from extreme events. Already, two-
thirds of the world population live within 60 km of the coast;
this is expected to rise to 75% by 2010 (IPCC, 1994). The total
amount of property assets is not well recorded. Hohmeyer and
Gartner (1992) updated a 1971 estimate to give $22 trillion,
but, allowing for economic growth, this must be at least $50
trillion by now, In 1988, insured property values were $2 tril-
lion on the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of the United States (IRC,
1995). Most of the insured cost of storms relates to domestic
property. This is explained by the sector’s greater size and the
greater likelihood that industry and government will self-insure
their risks from weather. Prosperity has resulted in an increas-
ing stock of personal property, often vulnerable to water, salt,
and smoke damage. Parallel changes have occurred in com-
mercial/industrial properties. Changes in organization and
practice, and the increased significance of services like
tourism, make interruption to business from extreme events
more important. See Chapters 11 and 12 for more detail.

ing the transfer of “profits” to capital reserves (ABI, 1993). In
recent years, media attention has highlighted insurance issues
(Winters, 1993). Insurers therefore have been forced to settle
claims with a minimum of investigation. Independent research
shows that many claims are now either exaggerated or totally
false (Shearn, 1994).

"Lengthy base periods and a stable climate are essential to
assess return periods (Knox, 1993; Tol, 1993). Reilly (1984)
suggests that using 30 years’ data could underestimate the true
tisk by 50%. Marco (1992) notes that current data may not be
adequate to assess 100-year flood levels, yet the latter is the
design level used for the U.S. Flood Program (with a second,
500-year level). Return periods often are reevaluated in the
light of new extremes (Wilkinson and Law, 1990; Tooley,
1992; Anderson and Black, 1993). Attempts to develop long
climate time series can be beset by inhomogeneities in the
underlying data (von Storch et al., 1993a). The impact of what
may be termed “combined events” is important for the indus-
try. Windstorm damage will be greatly increased if there is
associated heavy rain or a storm surge (Englefield et al., 1990;
Davis and Dolan, 1993). The need for appropriate information
has led some insurers to seek solutions through in-house
research (Munich Re, 1990, 1993).

"Windstorm: Maximum gust and storm duration are both impor-
tant (Schraft et al., 1993), as are gustiness (Muir-Wood, 1993)
and the location of the storm track in relation to population cen-
ters (Swiss Re, 1994a). A critical determinant of losses is the non-
linear relationship of windspeed to damage (Munich Re, 1993;
Schraft et al., 1993). Figure 17-1 shows this for the October 1987
storm that devastated southeast England (Dlugolecki, 1992).
Because there is a limit to the damage that can be suffered, the
full response curve is sigmoid. Hurricanes produce much higher
damage because they are more intense and often accompanied by
storm surges, and standards of building control may be poor.
“Rainy” storms are more costly than “dry” storms (Bryant, 1991).
This may mean an increased storm cost in the future because the
atmosphere will generally be more water-laden (see Chapter 6,
Climate Models—Projections of Future Climate, in the IPCC
Working Group I volume). Bryant (1991) also reports the possi-
bility that cyclones can trigger earthquakes.

"The length of model run is generally too short for statistical
analysis of extreme events. Longer model runs are becom-

For analysis of extreme events, model output may be
required at the daily timescale. Validation of variables
(e.g., daily temperature) generally demonstrates inad-

scaling methods offer opportunities to overcome this

"Just as climate varies regionally, we must expect any trends
toward changes, or variability, in climate also to vary regionally
(Jones and Briffa, 1992). One of the best-studied areas is North
Atlantic storms. A study of the literature indicates some of the
problems in attempting to determine whether trends are present.
Lamb (1991) and Diaz et al. (1992) compiled long series of storm
and wind records, respectively, but inhomogeneities in data col-
lection are obvious or have been detected (Isemer, 1992). In the
absence of reliable long-term records of windspeeds, one
approach is to use a proxy variable with a long homogeneous
record—for example, trends in the geostrophic wind calculated
from mean sea-level pressure data (Palutikof et al., 1992;
Schmidt and von Storch, 1993; von Storch et al., 1993b). These
authors failed to find any trend that could not be explained by
data inhomogeneities. A related insurance study suggests no trend
in UK storminess over 60 years (Christofides et al., 1992), but
other studies show a correlation between winter storms and tem-
perature (Doberitz, 1991; Dlugolecki, 1992) or a tendency to °
deeper depressions in the Atlantic in this century (Schinke, 1992).
Again, it has been suggested that this is due to inhomogeneities
in compiling weather maps (Schmidt and von Storch, 1993).

indirectly from the disruption caused (business interruption) as

able to water, salt, or smoke damage, and often stocks of goods
are minimal, so production quickly ceases (Berz, 1988;

"Reinsurers have noted a fourfold increase in disasters since the
1960s (Berz and Conrad, 1993). This is not due merely to bet-
ter recording, because the major disasters—which account for
90% of the losses and would always be recorded—have
increased just as quickly (Swiss Re, 1994a). Much of the rise
is due to socioeconomic factors, but many insurers feel that the
frequency of extreme events also has increased (Mercantile
and General Re, 1992; Berz and Conrad, 1993), At present, the
cost of insured catastrophes amounts to about 2.5% of global
non-life insurance premiums (Jakobi, 1994), but in Australia it
reaches 12%, without allowing for associated administration
(Brigstock and Minty, 1993). The UK used to be considered
relatively hazard-free. Since 1987, the cost of a single day’s
storm has twice exceeded £1 billion. Subsidence losses
exceeded £500 million in 1990 and 1991, from a base of under
£100 million in previous years (DIugolecki et al., 1995).

"Table 17-2 shows insurers had at least one “billion dollar” storm
event every year from 1987 to 1993. With such an unexpectedly
high frequency, some local insurance companies collapsed, and
the international reinsurance market went into shock. These cat-
astrophe losses were one of the reasons for the crisis at Lloyd’s,
where capacity for all types of insurance fell from £11.4 billion
to £8.9 billion between 1991 and 1993 (Tillinghast, 1994).
Following the initial reduction in reinsurance availability, there
has been recovery as new capital takes advantage of the conse-
quent rise in premium rates, often in offshore tax havens
(Hindle, 1993). However, this only has happened by trebling the
insurer’s retention and increasing the reinsurance charge by a
factor of four or five (Laderman, 1993). Reinsurance contracts

_how have far more restrictive conditions (Powers and Hearn,
1993; Jakobi, 1994). Some hazard-prone regions such as the
Caribbean and Pacific now find insurance very expensive or
even impossible to obtain (Murray, 1993).

insurers now are considering a more fundamental approach—
involving better ways of creating the funds required for irreg-

"On 12 September 1988, Hurricane Gilbert struck Jamaica with winds of 220 kph but no real storm surge. Total losses
were about $1 billion, equivalent to about one-third of the annual gross national product (GNP). More than 40% of the
housing stock was destroyed, with heavy losses in agriculture, industry, and public services (Siegel and Witham, 1991).
Indirect losses were estimated to be up to twice the direct damage, owing to lost production and reduced tourism. The
recovery process was hampered by lack of records (Siegel and Witham, 1991), damage to public infrastructure
(Alexander, 1993), and scarcity of many goods. Clement (1990) noted that the damage was exacerbated by poor con-

tract terms, and risk-management requirements (Murray, 1993; Saunders, 1993; Nesbeth, 1994), but only when
Hurricane Hugo emphasized the loss potential. Jamaica, like the entire Hurricane Belt, had been fortunate for many

Clearly, each country will have its own “critical event.” At one
time it was thought that two hurricane “hits” of $7 billion in
one season would be critical to the insurance industry (AIRAC,
1986). However, the industry coped with Hurricane Andrew
($16 billion insured damage, $30 billion in total), although
seven companies became insolvent and forty-four sought to
reduce their exposure afterward (Insurance Services Office,
1994), Exercises to assess the impact of a major earthquake on
the U.S. insurance industry provide some feel for the impact of
a major hurricane. Doherty (1993) felt that a $50 billion event
would seriously weaken the U.S. insurance industry with its
capital base of about $160 billion and leave property owners
less well-protected financially. A second study found that the
system should be able to cope with an event up to $100 billion
because of the immense size of the American economy (GDP
in 1990 was $5.5 trillion) (Cochrane, 1993). This study
assumed that new capital would enter ‘the industry. It neglected
the problems of regional blight and nonavailability of insur-
ance, which would certainly follow. Potentially, as insurers liq-
uidate investments to raise cash, there would be some impact
on financial markets, despite reconstruction (Hofmann, 1990).

"Insurers have traditionally shared major exposures to loss with
reinsurers. The solvency of the reinsurer is critical (Porro,
1984). Reinsurers now assess whether a given territory will be
able to “pay back” its losses within, say, 10 years and carefully
control their exposure (Crowley, 1991). Clearly therefore,
insurers can only insure great natural perils if they are them-
selves financially strong, they charge an economic rate to reflect
the underlying risk and the partial availability of reinsurance,
and they underwrite the risks by acquiring sufficient informa-
tion and adapting the contract terms to fit the degree of hazard.

"Suppose an insurer covers a portfolio of one million domestic buildings (with contents) valued in total at $100 billion. At
an average rate of $0.3%, this gives an annual total premium of $300 million. The rating allows for a catastrophe every
10 years at a claims cost of $100 million, or $10 million per year. The insurer holds free reserves equal to 40% of the
premium, equivalent to $120 million. Clearly, the fund can cope with the average catastrophe cost of $10 million per
year, but it would be virtually wiped out in the year of the disaster. This is why reinsurance is necessary.

be significant disadvantages. Few countries can bear the cost of
disaster alone (Mead, 1993). Many losses (e.g., tourism in East
Africa; Nanjira, 1991) would not be eligible. Funds may be
diverted from more desirable policies. It may encourage haz-

"Theoretical studies of risk transfer have identified several con-

Buhlman, 1986; Peele, 1988; Henri, 1991). These include:
inadequate spread of risk, undue influence on the event by the
policyholder, insufficient knowledge of the likely loss distrib-
ution, inability to define when a loss has occurred and quanti-
fy it, and, finally, premiums that are not affordable. The most
common areas of nonparticipation are flood damage and dam-
age to growing crops. A change in perception of the risk can
lead to withdrawal of participation—for example, following
storms in Fiji, Jamaica, and Florida (Clement, 1990; Anderson,

"In 1987, the typical excess-of-loss reinsurance protection was equivalent to 30% of the premium at risk (Laderman,
1993). In the above example, we assume that $90 million of the risk was transferred [remember, the risk is actually the
value of the property at risk (i.e., $100 billion)]. For this the insurer would pay a reinsurance premium somewhat higher
than the annualized catastrophe cost, say $12 million. In the year of a catastrophe, he would now suffer $10 million cata-
strophe (= $100-90 million), which his resources can accommodate. Clearly, if catastrophes become more frequent, the
reinsurer suffers most. However, if catastrophes become larger, the insurer suffers because he faces all the incremental
claims above the reinsurer’s cutoff point. In fact by 1993, the insurer would have raised his protection to $200 million,
but with a deductible of $30 million. At the same time, the reinsurer would have increased his charge to perhaps $75

million (Laderman, 1993)!

of the insurance industry. However, insurers and reinsurers
play a leading role in mapping hazards, promoting better
design codes, and improving the quality of implementation
through trade bodies like the Insurance Institute for Property
Loss Reduction (IIPLR) in the United States. At the micro-
level, insurers inspect many buildings, making insurance
dependent on adopting the inspector’s recommendations for
tisk mitigation. Loss control is generally efficient, with help
lines, recommended tradesmen, the use of loss adjusters in
emergency panels, instructions through the media, and special-
ist recovery agencies. However, with the whclesale reduction
of staffing in the financial sector, future response may be less
effective. It is important that insurers reflect varying degrees of
protection in their premium levels, to encourage risk manage-

"Risk management is “a discipline for living with the possibili-

embraces physical and monetary techniques; we deal with the
latter under other headings. Traditionally it has been site-spe-
cific, but now there are national and international initiatives
[e.g., International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction
(DNDR)]. Because development has grown very rapidly, there
often is no realization of the hazard potential. Also, insurance
is not required by the ultimate property owner until later and is
often just part of a financial deal. Effective risk management
comprises understanding the hazard and eliminating it, if pos-
sible; if not, it plans how to modify the impact of an event or
the property likely to be at hazard and how to mitigate the loss
after the event (Foster, 1984). It involves such techniques as
hazard mapping, improved design, simulations, and a full dis-
aster plan including the warning system, emergency response,
and recovery (Stone, 1992). Land-use control and information
are also essential (Berz, 1994), The issue of coastal defense is

risk analysis in hand, often prompted by UN initiatives such
as IDNDR. Probably the only viable way is to rely on each
country to carry out the work for its own hazards but to use
common standards—and with central funding for less-devel-
oped nations, possibly using the IDNDR as a body to coordi-
nate databases, not just for commercial needs but for the pub-
lic good (McCulloch and Etkin, 1995). The basic climate data

Government and its various departments:

- To resist new development in high risk areas

- To protect existing developments in high risk areas

- To plan how insurance can help society cope with

International bodies (e.g., United Nations): Many

issues now are transnational (e.g., pollution, competi-

considered fully in Chapter 11. Extreme conditions can be
very disruptive, causing damage and delay, often compound-
ed by human error in these conditions. There has not been a
major published study in this respect. Damage to infrastruc-
ture is generally not insured. Damage and particularly injury
caused to other users is often insured. Hail damage to vehicles
was a particular concern in the Munich hailstorm of 1984
(Munich Re, 1984). However, compensation for delays is not

"The general principle of insurance is to “‘share the risk.” Henri
(1993) points out that using a rate that does not reflect the
degree of hazard wiil result in economically inefficient behav-
ior (adverse selection). Below-average risks will be reluctant to
insure, while insurers will shy away from the increasingly
heavy pool of risks. A rate varying to reflect the individual
exposure to hazard encourages risk management but can result
in standard insurance becoming too expensive for some. It is
desirable for insurance to be a prerequisite of property purchase/
ownership; otherwise damage may not be repaired, leading to
a downward spiral of decay. It is easier to achieve tradeoffs
with a multi-peril policy (Anderson, 1976), and it has practical
benefits in claim handling.

"Retrofunding is sometimes used commercially, similar to a
banker’s line of credit (Jakobi, 1994), but generally it is a gov-
ernment tool, taking the form of relief payments. These pay-
ments often do not provide sufficient or efficient assistance
(Anderson, 1991; Kunreuther, 1984). The alternative of pre-
funding (insurance) is therefore coming to the fore. It is impor-
tant that natural-hazard insurance be treated as a long-term
business rather than being accounted and taxed annually. The
premiums must provide sufficient surplus to give a reserve for
disasters through the troughs of the underwriting cycle.
Catastrophe reserves should be accumulated over years, to
reduce reliance upon reinsurance arrangements or sharehold-
ers’ funds and to allow the accumulation of investment gains
(Porro, 1984). The build-up of such reserve funds often is
exempt from taxation (ABI, 1993; Candel, 1993). Insurers will
still require reinsurance to cope with “super-catastrophes” or
“multiple hits.”

"Adaptation: Given that there are many other imponderables
such as drugs or crime-related influences on human well-
being, it is unlikely that meaningful adjustments to mortality
tables can be made. However, investment strategy can be

periodically to recognize the current views on the impact of cli-
mate change (Porro, 1984).
"	Text
"Likely Impacts: The impact of climate change is likely to come
in two ways. The first is through changes in morbidity or mor-
tality. Such changes are associated with extremes of heat and
cold. Potentially, shifts in mean conditions could lead to the
introduction of new pests and diseases or, occasionally, the elim-
ination of old ones (Epstein and Sharp, 1994). There have been
many weather-related deaths in developing countries but, in gen-
eral, without any significant involvement of life insurers.
Indirect effects might include food and water shortages (see
Chapter 18). The second major impact is in the potential impact
on investments. Long-term decisions really need to include cli-
mate change as a factor, but this is definitely not happening yet.
This will be discussed more fully in Section 17.7.3.

"The other major industry is “banking,” which also covers a
wide range of activities. Liquid assets (e.g., savings and prof-
its) are invested, either short term to finance debt (e.g., over-
drafts) or long-term to finance assets (e.g., mortgages) and pro-
vide pensions. This requires banks to provide treasury and
investment-management services. Some investments are spec-
ulative, with an uncertain return, but often loans are provided
in return for fixed interest. This requires similar skills to insur-
ance underwriting, in order to assess the riskiness of the ven-
ture or the likelihood of repayment. Loans often are secured on
assets such as property (which is itself insured against damage)
in order to provide some guarantee of repayment. The majori-
ty of loans are short-term (less than five years). Finally, the sec-
tor may act to organize the raising of capital for a project or to

"By contrast with general insurance, these industries are long-
term, highly actuarial in nature, and often linked with savings
plans. The contracts are underwritten less rigorously than many
general policies, are unusually nonrenewable, and last for
many years, until terminated by death of the insured.
Investment of the premiums is a major activity, with the
emphasis on security over many years. A range of instruments
is used, from government bonds to corporate stock, real estate,
and fine art. The industry generated $770 billion in premiums
in 1992 and is highly influenced by changes in government
policy on social insurance and fiscal matters (Swiss Re,
1994b). As with general business, about 85% of the market lies
in the United States, EU, and Japan. Although the volume of
business is comparable to general insurance, the investible
funds are much greater ($3,075 billion in 1989, as against $832
billion for non-life business).
"	Text
"Liability insurance: Liability insurance has become a rather
difficult sector, with the over-use of tort law and increasing
emphasis on strict liability combined with environmental
degradation claims (Winters, 1993; Nutter, 1994). In dealing
with impacts of weather, it is often difficult to prove negligence
or to identify a currently pursuable person or organization.
There has been some litigation in this field—for example, con-
trol of tree-root invasion into neighboring buildings (Institution
of Structural Engineers, 1994); control of undergrowth follow-
ing bush fires in Australia costing over $100 million
(Alexander, 1993); limitation of beach erosion, which is often
initiated by human action (Bryant, 1991); and even the accura-
cy of weather forecasts and flood control (Kusler, 1985). At a
strategic level, there has even been discussion of national lia-
bility for climate change (Stone, 1992; Leggett, 1994), but this
does not seem likely to become a commercially insurable risk.
An interesting case cited by Changnon and Changnon (1990)
involved liability for overselling drought policies, resulting in
underwriting losses of $8 million.

"Crop insurance: Agriculture is a key sector in many nations,
though often it is not a part of the market economy. In most
countries, insurers do not offer coverage for growing crops
because of the. possibility of catastrophic loss and the difficul-
ties of loss control and evaluation. However, schemes do exist.
Durham (1994) describes the use of crop insurance in the
United States, where a multi-peril-crop insurance policy is
sponsored by the federal government, with varying participa-
tion by private insurers. Hueth and Furtan (1994) coordinated
a detailed investigation of such schemes in the United States,
Canada, and other developed economies. They came to the
conclusion that crop insurance was not the best way to address
farmers’ yield uncertainty because of moral hazard (the temp-
tation not to mitigate losses because they will be met by insur-
ance) and adverse selection (the tendency for farmers with
worse-than-average risks to insure, knowing that they will
make a “profit,” while the better risks will not insure). The sit-
uation is further complicated by the relatively liberal granting
of disaster relief in times of hardship, which discourages the
prudent farmer from buying insurance at all. Sugar-crop insur-
ance in Mauritius has been compulsory since 1946 and is gov-
ernment-administered. The scheme was discussed for Tanzania
but not adopted (Putty, 1984). Similar schemes exist elsewhere
(e.g., Costa Rica), with support from the banking sector
(Gallardo, 1984). Climate change is expected to have signifi-
cant impacts on agriculture (see Chapter 13), so it may be
expected that interest in this area will increase.

"In relation to this topic, banks fall into three types: internation-
al banks (i.e., economically involved all over the world);
regional banks; and specialist banks, including building soci-
eties, “thrifts,” and similar institutions. There has been much
talk of product integration between banks and insurers (still for-
bidden in some countries). However, the cultural differences in
treating claims versus bad debts, for example, make this unlike-
ly for the mass consumer market. At corporate level, “risk” and
“finance” are almost interchangeable (Seebauer, 1992).

"It will be important to ensure that insurance coverage is avail-
able throughout the lifetime of loans. This will mean more
stringent lending conditions. Environmentally integrated
assessment, with regard to the direct impact on assets and the

Closer cooperation with insurers, to the extent of partnership or
even ownership, is a possibility. Alternatively, it may require
government intervention to ensure that alternative protection is
available (Britton, 1989; Kunreuther, 1993).

"Investment activities can be affected indirectly by climate
change through the actions of other sectors. In particular, miti-

have a strong effect on the transport and energy sectors. This
may alter the economics of specific technologies and entire
nations or regions, with implications for rates of return on invest-
ment. Without coherent early guidance, changes in policy may
result in suboptimal investment decisions. A more subtle effect
on banking may stem from the changing mix of consumption
and business activities brought about by climate change
(Vaughan, 1994). This will surely affect the requirements for
financial services, but no study has been made of this yet.

"It can be argued that for the world banking system there is no
critical threshold of climate change because banks would coop-
erate to reestablish a new basis, as happened after the Third-
World debt crisis. The huge scale of global financial flows
would outweigh the likely cost of even a series of catastrophes
(Dlugolecki and Klein, 1994). At the national level, the bank-
ing system could be reestablished with external assistance, but
of course this would result in a permanent weakening of the
local economy though adjustments in the exchange rate and
interest rates. As with insurance, the scale of event will vary
from one country to another. For Jamaica, Hurricane Gilbert
was extreme enough to cause lasting financial damage
(Commonwealth Secretariat, 1991), Cochrane (1993) reports
that the U.S. banking system has withstood two shocks of
around $300 billion due to rapid changes in oil prices. He con-
cludes that the effect of $100 billion natural catastrophe (in this
case, earthquake) could be absorbed. While this might be true

"Banking will be affected indirectly as its customers find their
operations, consumption, and/or financial circumstances
affected by climate change. Specifically, the banking industry
and any investment activity could be affected if property
insurers withdraw coverage from property that was the subject
for some long-term financial transaction. This already has
happened in some small island states, and any coastal site
must be challengable (Leggett, 1993a; Dlugolecki et al.,
1995). Indeed, the burden of uninsured catastrophe losses
could cause loan defaults (Vaughan, 1994). Sectors that may
be adversely affected, such as tourism and agriculture in cer-
tain regions, may find it difficult to raise finance if uninsured
losses are perceived to be a real threat to viability. Moreover,
a fall in property values precipitated by a loss of confidence in
the local economy could itself trigger a “credit famine,”
because property is often used as security for loans (Medioli,
1989; Bender, 1991; Thompson, 1995).

"It should be evident that some activities or projects are more
likely to be affected by climate change than others. Therefore,
this should be taken into account when appraising any invest-
ment. In particular, assets with long life spans situated in coastal
zones or river basins may be sensitive, and there may be certain
stages of construction that are more vulnerable (Anderson,
1991; Bender, 1991). The classic banking solutions to increased
risk are similar to those of property insurers: restricted involve-
ment (with consequent difficulties for economic activity) and
higher prices, including an environmental risk premium—often
not easy to achieve in a competitive environment. More radical
approaches are necessary for a fundamental issue like climate
change, and enlightened bankers are already exploring such
avenues in the light of sustainable development initiatives
(Vaughan, 1994). This will initially require a substantial effort
to understand the problems and may generate new services to
assist those clients most affected, once they have been identified
through improved screening. A suitable starting place for such
studies will be comprehensive national and international assess-
ments of climate change impact, which allow an integrated

governments to give an early indication of how they might

event is very low, consumers act as if it will never happen,
even if the probable maximum loss is very high. It will there-

mandatory policies for risk-prone locations, backed by appro-

"Adaptation: The role of financial markets is to reallocate risk

sures. Key hazards are drought, flood, and storm, which often
are not insured. Key vulnerable areas are developing countries
(Stone, 1992), small island states and coastal zones (IPCC,
1990), cities (Cohen, 1991), and agriculture (IPCC, 1990). The
public infrastructure is vital to recovery, but it is often exposed
to natural hazards and may require retrofitting for robustness
(Kreimer and Munasinghe, 1991; Minnery and Smith, 1995).

"With better information, it will be possible to assess the
risk exposure of individual entities and the nation as a
whole. This will serve as a basis for discussion about which
risks can be borne by the private sector. Where the risk is
too hazardous for private insurance companies, there still
are many advantages in involving the private insurance sec-
tor in planning for disaster mitigation. Their practical
knowledge of marketing a financial product, tariff struc-
tures, access to international resources, damage recovery,
avoidance of duplicate administration, and fraud control
would prove invaluable (Leggett, 1993b; Vellinga and Tol,
1994). Similarly, because of the large-scale financial impli-
cations of adaptation or mitigation strategies, it will be
important to consider whether and how the financial sector
can contribute.

"It is anticipated that most of the impacts would be adverse.
Some would occur via relatively direct pathways (e.g., deaths
from heat waves and from extreme weather events); others
would occur via indirect pathways (e.g., changes in the range
of vector-borne diseases), Some impacts would be deferred in
time and would occur on a larger scale than most other envi-
ronmental health impacts with which we are familiar. If long-
term climate change ensues, indirect impacts probably would
predominate.
"	Text
"Populations with different levels of natural, technical, and
social resources would differ in their vulnerability to climate-
induced health impacts. Such vulnerability, due to crowding,
food insecurity, local environmental degradation, and per-
turbed ecosystems, already exists in many communities in
developing countries. Hence, because of both the geography
of climate change and these variations in population vulnera-
bility, climate change would impinge differently on different
populations.
"	Text
"The sustained health of human populations requires the contin-
ued integrity of Earth’s natural systems. The disturbance, by
climate change, of physical systems (e.g., weather patterns,
sea-level, water supplies) and of ecosystems (e.g., agroecosys-
tems, disease-vector habitats) would therefore pose risks to
human health. The scale of the anticipated health impacts is
that of whole communities or populations (i.e., it is a public
health, not a personal health, issue). These health impacts
would occur in various ways, via pathways of varying direct-
ness and complexity, including disturbance of natural and man-
aged ecosystems. With some exceptions, relatively little
research has yet been done that enables quantitative description
of these probable health impacts.

"An increased frequency or severity of heat waves
would cause an increase in (predominantly cardiores-
piratory) mortality and illness (High Confidence).
Studies in selected urban populations in North
America, North Africa, and East Asia indicate that the
number of heat-related deaths would increase several-
fold in response to two general circulation model
(GCM)-modeled climate change scenarios for 2050.
In very large cities, this would represent several thou-
sand extra deaths annually. Although this heat-related
increase in deaths would be partially offset by fewer
cold-related deaths, there are insufficient data to
quantify this tradeoff; further, this balance would vary
by location and according to adaptive responses
(Medium Confidence).

"If extreme weather events (droughts, floods, storms,
etc.) were to occur more often, increases in rates of
death, injury, infectious diseases, and psychological
disorders would result (High Confidence).

Net climate change-related increases in the geograph-
ic distribution (altitude and latitude) of the vector
organisms of infectious diseases (e.g., malarial mos-
quitoes, schistosome-spreading snails) and changes in
the life-cycle dynamics of both vector and infective
parasites would, in aggregate, increase the potential
transmission of many vector-borne diseases (High
Confidence). Malaria, of which there are currently
around 350 million new cases per year (including two
million deaths), provides a central example.
Simulations with first-generation mathematical mod-
els (based on standard climate-change scenarios and
incorporating information about the basic dynamics
of climatic influences on malaria transmission) pre-
dict an increase in malaria incidence in Indonesia by
2070 and—with a highly aggregated model—an
increase from around 45% to around 60% in the pro-
portion of the world population living within the
potential malaria transmission zone by the latter half
of the next century. Although this predicted increase
in potential transmission encroaches mostly into tem-
perate regions, actual climate-related increases in
malaria incidence (estimated by one model to be of
the order of 50-80 million additional cases annually,
relative to an assumed global background total of 500
million by 2100) would occur primarily in tropical,
subtropical, and less well protected temperate-zone
populations currently at the margins of endemically
infected areas. Some localized decreases may also
occur (Medium Confidence).

Increases in non-vector-borne infectious diseases
such as cholera, salmonellosis, and other food- and
water-related infections also could occur, particularly
in tropical and subtropical regions, because of climat-
ic impacts on water distribution, temperature, and
microorganism proliferation (Medium confidence).
The effects of climate change on agricultural, animal,
and fisheries productivity, while still uncertain, could
increase the prevalence of malnutrition and hunger
and their long-term health impairments, especially in
children. This would most probably occur regionally,
with some regions likely to experience gains, and oth-
ers losses, in food production (Medium Confidence).
There would also be many health impacts of the phys-

"In conclusion, the impacts of global climate change, particu-
larly if sustained in the longer term, could include a multitude
of serious—but thus far underrecognized—impacts on human
health. Human population health is an outcome that integrates
many other inputs, and it depends substantially on the stabili-
ty and productivity of many of Earth’s natural systems.
Therefore, human health is likely to be predominantly
adversely affected by climate change and its effects upon
those systems.

"There is immediate need for improved and internationalized
monitoring of health-risk indicators in relation to climate
change. Existing global monitoring activities should encom-
pass health-related environmental and bioindicator-species
measurements and, where appropriate, direct measures of
human population health status. To assist the evolution of pub-
lic understanding and social policy, the health sciences must
develop improved methods, including integrated predictive
models, to better assess how climate change (and other global
environmental changes) would influence human health.

"Adaptive options to minimize health impacts include improved
and extended medical care services; environmental manage-
ment; disaster preparedness; protective technology (housing,
air conditioning, water purification, vaccination, etc.); public
education directed at personal behaviors; and appropriate pro-
fessional and research training. It also will be important to
assess in advance any risks to health from proposed technolog-
ical adaptations (e.g., exposures that could result from using
certain alternative energy sources and replacement chemicals
for chlorofluorocarbons; effects of pesticide use on resistance
of vector organisms and their predator populations).

natural resources (especially fresh water) (Medium
Confidence).

Because fossil-fuel combustion produces both carbon
dioxide and various primary air pollutants, the climate
change process would be associated with increased
levels of urban air pollution. Not only is air pollution
itself an important health hazard, but hotter tempera-
tures, in urban environments, would enhance both the
formation of secondary pollutants (e.g., ozone) and
the health impact of certain air pollutants. There
would be increases in the frequency of allergic disor-
ders and of cardiorespiratory disorders and deaths
caused by various air pollutants (e.g., ozone and par-
ticulates) (High Confidence).

A potentially important category of health impact
would result from the deterioration in social and eco-
nomic circumstances that might arise from adverse
impacts of climate change on patterns of employment,
wealth distribution, and population mobility and set-
tlement. Conflicts might arise over dwindling envi-
ronmental resources (Medium Confidence).
Stratospheric ozone is being depleted concurrently
with greenhouse gas accumulation in the troposphere.
Although there are some shared and interactive atmos-
pheric processes between disturbances of the stratos-
phere and troposphere, both they and their health
impacts arise via quite distinct pathways. A sustained
10-15% depletion of stratospheric ozone over several
decades would cause increased exposure to ultraviolet
radiation and an estimated 15-20% increase in the
incidence of skin cancer in fait-skinned populations
(High Confidence). Lesions of the eye (e.g., cataracts)
also may increase in frequency, as might vulnerability
to some infectious diseases via adverse effects on
immune function (Medium Confidence).

various effects upon the health of human populations (WHO,

involved, the scale of these climate-related changes would, in
general, apply to whole populations or communities, rather

of localized exposure to environmental contaminants, nor via
locally determined influences on the spread of infectious dis-

future lung cancer rates can be predicted as a function of a

anticipated future profile of exposure (e.g., smoking habits in
the year 2020), yet this is the nature of the present exercise:
Potential health impacts are being assessed in relation to
future scenarios of climate change. There are inevitable, mul-

"Forecasting health impacts requires knowledge of, first, the
sensitivity of change in population health status in response to
climate change and, second, of any associated thresholds.
“Sensitivity” refers to the rate of change in health outcome per
unit change in climate (however defined), whereas “threshold”
refers to a sudden change in slope or curvature in that dose-
response graph (e.g., a certain amount of climate change may
be tolerated before an impact on some particular health out-
come occurs).

"Some health impacts can be forecast by relatively simple
extrapolation from empirical epidemiological dose-response
data. For example, models to predict the mortality impacts of
an increase in heatwaves can be based on existing empirical
data. However, predicting the health impact of climate-induced
shifts in ecological relationships and habitat boundaries (e.g.,
malarial mosquitoes, agricultural crops) poses a more complex
challenge. Equally complex is the task of predicting the vari-
ous indirect health impacts of such things as sea-level rise or of
civil disruption and enforced migration because of deteriorat-
ing environments and dwindling resources.

"Although it is tempting to compile a list of discrete health
impacts, it is important that the systemic quality of the impact
of climate change be understood. There would be many cross-
links, including interactions of climate change with other,
coexisting environmental changes. Further, the attempts of
society to mitigate the health effects of climate change may
actually exacerbate some of them. For example, increased use
of fertilizers to compensate for a decline in local agricultural
production can increase algal blooms and hence the risk of
cholera or shellfish poisoning; or the relocation of populations
from drought-stricken areas might introduce them to unfamil-
iar pathogens (or introduce their unfamiliar pathogens).
"	Text
"Some aspects of climate change and its first-level impacts (on
sea level, coastal ecosystems, forests, agriculture, fisheries,
etc.), as projected by IPCC Working Group I, would lie outside
the range of recorded human health experience. Hence, the
forecasting of human health impacts must rely principally upon
teference to historical analogy (where available) and reason-
able extrapolation, judgment, and the use of integrated mathe-
matical models (Niessen and Rotmans, 1993; McMichael and
Martens, 1995). Most of the health impact modeling to date has
been at a highly aggregated global or regional level, with no
capacity to make finer-grained predictions. Ongoing develop-
ments in modeling techniques include the incorporation of
complex nonlinear relationships and feedback processes, deal-
ing with uncertainty, and richer use of local detail (Alcamo et
al., 1994a, 1994b).
"	Text
"A further difficulty arises with regional predictions. Not only is
the ability to predict regional differences in climate change still
limited, but human populations differ greatly in their environ-
mental circumstances, social resources, and preexisting health
status. They therefore differ in their vulnerability to climate-
induced stresses. Although there is generally insufficient infor-
mation available to make differentiated assessments of health
impacts in different populations, the balance of the assessments
published to date is that, because of the geography of the
impacts of climate change (particularly in relation to infectious
disease transmission and food production) and of population
vulnerability, many of the anticipated adverse health impacts
would be greater in the world’s less-developed regions.
Nevertheless, in developed countries, demographic trends
including population aging and increasing levels of disability,
chronic illness, and coastal retirement may increase the vul-
nerability of populations.
"	Text
"The impact of thermal stress depends on physiological
tolerance thresholds being exceeded (see Section
18.2.1). For example, most studies of heat-related mor-
tality show that increased mortality occurs only after a
critical temperature has been exceeded for a certain
duration. This critical temperature varies geographical-
ly, reflecting socioeconomic differences, physiological
acclimatization, and cultural-technical adaptation.
Infectious disease pathogens and insect pests are nor-
mally constrained by bioclimatic thresholds. That is,
there is a range of climatic conditions with upper and
lower thresholds within which a population of organ-
isms is viable (Dobson and Carper, 1993). These
thresholds account for seasonal and longer-term fluc-
tuations in the distribution and abundance of most
organisms. The uncoupling, by climate change, of
previously stable ecological relationships between
species would reveal other thresholds as population
imbalances pass critical points.

Changes in the distribution of organisms (e.g., mos-
quitoes) that spread vector-borne diseases (e.g.,
malaria) would occur if climate change causes their
geographic range to shift. This shift would reflect the
critical thresholds of temperature, precipitation, and
humidity (i.e., the bioclimatograph) for vector matu-
ration and persistence. For example, the range of
Plasmodium vivax malaria is limited because the par-
asite cannot develop inside its mosquito host at tem-
peratures below 14-16°C (Gilles, 1993). Further,
blood-feeding arthropods feed and reproduce only
above certain temperatures and need less time to com-
plete their life cycle as temperatures increase above
that threshold (Curto de Casas and Carcavallo, 1984;
Burgos et al., 1994). Threshold effects also apply to
the life cycle of the infecting parasite.

Some animal and plant populations would be unable
to migrate or adapt behaviorally to climate change, in
part because of constraints imposed by non-climate

the determination of health status, and many of these would

shaped relationship) between daily outdoor temperature and
daily death rate: Mortality is lowest within an intermediate com-
fortable temperature range. The graph is not symmetrical; the
death rate increases much more steeply with rising temperatures,
above this comfort zone, than it does with falling temperatures
below that zone (Longstreth, 1989; Kalkstein, 1993; Kunst er al.,
1993; Touloumi et al., 1994). Relatedly, death rates in temperate
countries appear to be affected across a wider band of decreas-
ing, cold, temperatures than that for increasing, hot, temperatures
(Kilbourne, 1992; Kunst et al., 1993). Because death rates in
temperate and subtropical zones are higher in winter than in
summer (Kilbourne, 1992), it is a reasonable expectation that
milder winters in such countries would entail a reduction in cold-
related deaths and illnesses. However, since summer-related
deaths appear to be more related to temperature extremes than
are winter-related deaths, this reduction may not fully offset the
heat-related increases. Further, this balance of gains and losses
would vary among geographic regions and different populations.
The issue of balance is examined further later in this section.

living in poverty, including segments of many urban popula-
tions in developing countries, are particularly vulnerable to
heat stress. Poor housing, the urban heat island effect, and lack
of air conditioning are among the primary causes (Kilbourne,
1989), Complete acclimatization may take up to several years
(Babeyev, 1986), rendering immigrants (e.g., rural-to-urban)
vulnerable to weather extremes for a considerable time.
Ongoing rapid increases in urbanization (see Chapter 12) will
increase the number of vulnerable persons.

"The question in relation to the abovementioned notion of “mor-
tality displacement” is: Would some of those who die during
heat waves have succumbed soon afterward from preexisting
frailty or disease (Kalkstein, 1993; U.S. EPA, in press)?
Various time-series analyses indicate a “deficit” in daily deaths
for up to a month after heat waves (e.g., Figure 18-2), and U.S.-
based research suggests that 20-40% of the deaths occurring
during heat waves would have occurred within the next few
weeks (Kalkstein, 1993). A related uncertainty is whether, as
the frequency of heat waves increases, the mortality excess
remains constant or whether, as some research suggests, suc-
cessive heat waves entail a progressive lessening of the associ-
ated mortality peak.

"The effect of extreme heat on mortality is exacerbated by low
wind, high humidity, and intense solar radiation (Kilbourne,
1992). Indeed, these meteorological elements can be treated
synoptically, to evaluate the net impact of weather on human
health. For example, recent studies in the United States have
described “oppressive” air masses (analogous to the meteorol-
ogist’s “stagnating” air masses), which represent synoptic
meteorological situations that exceed physiological tolerance
levels. This approach recognizes that humans principally
respond to the umbrella of air that surrounds them rather than
to individual meteorological elements (Kalkstein, 1993). It also
should be noted that concurrent hot weather and air pollution
have interactive impacts on health (Katsouyanni et al., 1993;
see also Section 18.3.5).

"Global warming is predicted to increase the frequency of very
hot days (see Chapter 6, Climate Models—Projections of Future
Climate, of the IPCC Working Group I volume). The frequen-
cy of such days in temperate climates (e.g., USA, UK,
Australia) would approximately double for an increase of
2-3°C in the average summer temperature (e.g., CDC, 1989;
Climate Change Impacts Review Group UK, 1991). Extensive
research has shown that heat waves cause excess deaths
(Weihe, 1986; Kilbourne, 1992). Recent analyses of concurrent
meteorological and mortality data in cities in the United States,
Canada, the Netherlands, China, and the Middle East provide
confirmatory evidence that overall death rates rise during heat
waves (Kalkstein and Smoyer, 1993; Kunst et al., 1993), par-
ticularly when the temperature rises above the local popula-
tion’s threshold value. Therefore, it can be predicted confi-
dently that climate change would, via increased exposure to
heat waves, cause additional heat-related deaths and illnesses
(Kalkstein, 1993; Haines et al., 1993).

"Healthy persons have efficient heat regulatory mechanisms that
cope with increases in temperature up to a particular threshold.
The body can increase radiant, convective, and evaporative heat
loss by vasodilation (enlargement of blood vessels in the skin)
and perspiration (Horowitz and Samueloff, 1987; Diamond,
1991). Further, some acclimatization to persistent oppressive
weather conditions can occur within several days (Kilbourne,
1992). Nevertheless, the risk of death increases substantially
when thermal stress persists for several consecutive days
(Kalkstein and Smoyer, 1993). The elderly and very young are
disproportionately affected because of their limited physiologi-
cal capacity to adapt. Although some individuals die from heat
exhaustion or heatstroke, the deaths associated with very hot
weather are predominantly associated with preexisting cardio-
vascular and respiratory disorders, as well as accidents (Larsen,
1990a, 1990b). Although there is less evidence on nonfatal ill-
ness episodes, it is a reasonable general assumption that thermal
stress also increases rates of morbidity.

of the numbers of additional deaths attributable to heat during
a typical summer in a future warmer world were thus obtained.
Two sets of predicted mortality increases were made: one

Such events increase deaths, injuries, infectious diseases, stress-

"Consider the population of Atlanta, for example. Presently,
Atlanta experiences an average of 78 heat-related deaths each
summer. Under the climate projections of the Geophysical Fluid
Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) 1989 (transient) climate-change
model, and assuming no change in population size or age pro-
file, this number would increase to 191 in the year 2020 and to
293 in the year 2050. If population acclimatization occurs, the
annual total would increase less, to 96 and 147 in those two
years. Under the UKTR (transient) model run, the correspond-
ing four projections of heat-related mortality are 20-40% high-
er than for the GFDL model run: 247 and 436 deaths (unaccli-
matized, 2020 and 2050) and 124 and 218 deaths (acclimatized,
2020 and 2050). These and other results for selected North
American cities, Shanghai, and Cairo indicate that the annual
number of heat-related deaths would, very approximately, dou-
ble by 2020 and would increase several-fold by 2050. Thus, in
very large cities with populations displaying this type of sensi-
tivity to heat stress, climate change would cause several thou-
sand extra heat-related deaths annually.

"As mentioned earlier, the seasonal death rates in developed
countries are highest in winter (Kilbourne, 1992; Tan, 1994). In
temperate-zone countries, death rates increase particularly dur-
ing periods of severe winter weather. However, no single study
has yet been published that allows a direct comparison of the
anticipated winter gains and summer losses that would accom-
pany global warming. A substantial proportion of winter-related
deaths are from cardiovascular disease (Kunst et al., 1993;
Langford and Bentham, 1995). It is likely that this increased
risk of cardiovascular disease reflects an increased cold-induced
tendency for blood to clot (Keatinge et al., 1989), perhaps exac-
erbated by the fibrinogen-enhancing effect of winter respirato-
ry infections (Woodhouse et al., 1994), The relative importance
of respiratory infections and cardiovascular diseases to antici-
pated reductions in mortality, and how these would vary geo-
graphically, remains uncertain. One recent British study has
forecast that approximately 9,000 fewer winter-related deaths
(estimated to represent a reduction of 2-3%) would occur annu-
ally by the year 2050 in England and Wales, under typical cli-
mate-change scenarios that entail 2-2.5°C wintertime increases
(Langford and Bentham, 1995). Just over half the avoided deaths
would be from ischaemic heart. disease and stroke, with chronic
bronchitis and pneumonia each contributing 5—10%. Other
researchers have concluded that a significant portion of the over-
all winter-related mortality is due to respiratory infections such as

humidity (Gill, 1920a, 1920b; Sutherst, 1983). Although anophe-

First, a major effect of extreme climatic events on human health
has been malnutrition and starvation due to severe drought and
its consequences (Escudero, 1985). This, in turn, causes
increased susceptibility to infection (Tomkins, 1986). Second,
there is evidence that environmental degradation, unequal
access to resources, and population growth may be potent fac-
tors in provoking conflict (Homer-Dixon ef al., 1993). By
affecting water and food supply, climate change could increase
the possibility of violent conflicts in a number of regions.

"Flash flooding is a leading cause of weather-related mortality in
the United States (French and Holt, 1989). Damage to homes and
displacement of residents may facilitate the spread of infectious
diseases because of crowded living conditions. Flooding can con-

Flooding also increases runoff from agricultural lands and urban
stormwater systems (Thurman et al., 1991, 1992). Water
resources thus are contaminated by toxic chemical wastes, agri-
cultural chemicals, and pathogens (e.g., Cryptosporidium).
Hazardous exposure may arise from contaminated drinking water

such diseases would increase (geographically or from seasonal

control these diseases also will change. New or improved vac-

It is therefore projected that climate change and altered weath-
er patterns would affect the range (both latitude and altitude),
intensity, and seasonality of many vector-borne and other
infectious diseases. In general, increased warmth and moisture
would enhance transmission of these diseases. However, any
such climate-related redistribution of disease may also entail—
perhaps in conjunction with other environmental stresses—
some localized reductions in rates of infection.

"The sustained (or endemic) transmission of VBDs requires
favorable climatic-environmental conditions for the vector, the
parasite, and, if applicable, the intermediate host species. For
vectors with long life spans (e.g., tsetse flies, bugs, ticks), vec-
tor abundance is a major determinant of disease distribution;
arthropods that transmit VBDs generally thrive in warmth and
moisture. For vectors with short life spans (e.g., mosquitoes,
sandflies, blackflies), the temperature-sensitive extrinsic matu-
ration period of the parasite is of critical importance. The geo-
graphic distributions of many of the parasites, both unicellular
(protozoa) and multicellular (e.g., flukes and worms), correlate
closely with temperature (Gillet, 1974; Shope, 1991). The geo-
graphic distributions of vector-borne viral infections, such as
dengue and yellow fever, are affected by temperature and sur-
face water distribution. For many VBDs, such as plague and
hantavirus, rodents act as intermediate infected hosts or as
hosts for the arthropod vector (Wenzel, 1994); rodent activity
would also tend to increase in a warmer world (Shope, 1991).

change would increase the potential transmission of malaria in

2070. Because of the limited technical information, it is not easy to appraise these particular forecasts.

"A more complex integrated global model has been developed by Martens et al. (1994). This model takes account of how
climate change would affect the mosquito population directly—i.e., mosquito development, feeding frequency, and
longevity—and the incubation period of the parasite inside the mosquito (see Figure 18-3). As a highly aggregated
model, it does not take account of local environmental-ecological factors, and it therefore cannot be regarded as a source
of precise projections. The model’s output refers to geographic changes in potential transmission (i.e., the range within
which both the mosquito and parasite could survive with sufficient abundance for sustained transmission of malaria).
This is not, therefore, a projection of actual disease incidence, and it must be interpreted in relation to local control mea-
sures, health services, parasite reservoir, and mosquito densities. Further, until such models have been validated against
historical data sets, their predictions must be viewed cautiously.

"This particular model predicts widespread increases in the potential habitat range and the “vectorial capacity” of the
mosquito, and therefore potential malaria transmission, in response to climate change. For example, using GCM predic-

population is estimated to increase twofold in tropical regions and substantially more than tenfold in temperate climates
(Martens et al., 1995a). Overall, there is an increase from around 45% to around 60% of the world population living
within the potential malaria transmission zone by the latter half of the next century. However, most of the developed
countries have effective control and surveillance measures that should preclude reintroduction of endemic malaria. In
the already endemic areas, especially in the subtropics, malaria may increase (although in some hot climates, further
temperature increases may shorten the life span of mosquitoes, and local malaria transmission would then decrease). In
particular, in adjoining areas of lower endemicity or unstable malaria, the occurrence of infection is far more sensitive

able prediction that, in eastern Africa, a relatively small
increase in winter temperature could extend the mosquito habi-
tat and thus enable falciparum malaria to reach beyond the
usual altitude limit of around 2,500 m to the large, malaria-
free, urban highland populations, e.g., Nairobi in Kenya and
Harare in Zimbabwe. Indeed, the monitoring of such popula-
tions around the world, currently just beyond the boundaries of
stable endemic malaria, could provide early evidence of cli-
mate-related shifts in malaria distribution (Haines et al., 1993).

it would bring together vertebrate animals of different species

Warming (and rising sea levels) would displace some human

areas where zoonotic infectious agents are being transmitted in
silent wildlife cycles. Migratory humans would thus be at risk of
infection with enzootic (i.e., locally prevalent animal-infecting)
agents. Climate-induced changes in ecology also could force
the rapid evolution of infectious agents, with newly emergent
strains of altered virulence or pathogenicity. Additionally,
changes in climate means and variability can disrupt predator/
prey ratios, thus loosening natural controls on pests and
pathogens.

"Many vector-borne infective agents are viruses. The human-
infecting arboviruses (i.e., arthropod-borne viruses) generally
have a mosquito vector. Arboviral infections span a wide clin-
ical spectrum, from those that cause mild feverish illness or
subclinical infections to those causing severe and often fatal
encephalitis (brain inflammation) or hemorrhagic fever. Under
favorable environmental conditions, an arboviral disease can
become epidemic (population-wide), from a local endemic
base or by its introduction to a previously unaffected area. The
distribution and abundance of vectors are influenced by vari-
ous physical factors (temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind)
and biological factors (vegetation, host species, predators, par-
asites, and human interventions) (WHO, 1990). Temperature
also affects the rapidity of the virus’ life cycle—e.g., the extrin-
sic incubation period for the mosquito-hosted stage of the yel-
low fever virus varies from several weeks to 8-10 days,
depending on temperature.

Dengue is transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, as is
urban yellow fever. In parts of Asia, dengue also is transmitted
by Ae. albopictus, which now is colonizing North and South
America. Research in Mexico has shown that an increase of
3-4°C in average temperature doubles the rate of transmission
of the dengue virus (Koopman et al., 1991), Although there is
no clear evidence of regional climatic influence, annual epi-
demics of dengue have returned to Central America over the
past decade (as they did about twenty years ago in Asia), and,
in Mexico, dengue has recently spread to previously unaffect-

mosquitoes, once limited to 1,000 meters altitude by tempera-
ture in Colombia, have been recently reported above 2,200
meters, The habitat of the mosquito is restricted to areas with a
mean midwinter temperature of more than 10°C. Epidemic
transmission of dengue is seldom sustained at temperatures
below 20°C (Halstead, 1990).

"There is thus a clear need for enhanced research and monitor-
ing activities. This need reflects the assessment that the poten-
tial health impacts of climate change, particularly if sustained
in the longer term and if generally adverse, could be a serious
consequence of the ongoing anthropogenic changes in the
composition of Earth’s atmosphere.

"role in reducing a range of health impacts, including some
vector-borne and other communicable diseases, and the
effects of extreme events. One example is extension of vacci-
nation coverage, although no suitable vaccines exist for some
of the diseases most sensitive to climate change (e.g., dengue
and schistosomiasis) or for many of the newly emerging
infections.
"	Text
"Finally, if health impacts of climate change are probable and
serious, then the only effective long-term basis for mitigation
lies in primary prevention at the societal level. This would
require acceptance of the Precautionary Principle as the foun-
dation of policy response. This, in turn, would suggest some
fundamental, and therefore difficult, reorientations of social,
economic, and political priorities. Meanwhile, care must be
taken that alternative technologies do not introduce new
health hazards.
"	Text
"In view of limitations to the forecasting of health impacts at
this stage of our knowledge, an important and practical form of
adaptation would be to improve large-scale monitoring and
surveillance systems, especially for vulnerable populations and
areas. Recently initiated efforts to observe and monitor aspects
of the Earth’s environment and ecosystems in relation to cli-
mate change now should incorporate health-related monitoring
(Haines et al., 1993). Advances in climate forecasting and in
the regional integration of ecological and health monitoring
(including local vulnerability factors) will facilitate develop-
ment of early-warning systems.

toring health (including the use of sensitive species as

bioindicators), and the opportunity to detect and/or
examine previously unsuspected or undocumented

Some specific research needs include:

— Comparison of impacts of heat waves in urban
and rural populations, to clarify the relative
importance of thermal stress and air pollutants

— Examination of the interplay between climatic
impacts on forests and other terrestrial ecosystems

"Forecasting the health impacts of global climate change
entails unavoidable uncertainty and complexity, Human popu-
lations vary greatly in their vulnerability to climate changes
and in their resources for protection and mitigation. Likewise,
the responses of infectious disease vectors to changes in cli-
mate depend greatly on other concomitant environmental
stresses and the adequacy of control measures and health care
systems. Meanwhile, population health status continues to be
influenced by a rich mix of cultural and socioeconomic fac-
tors. Hence, assessing the health impact of climate change
requires a systems-based modeling approach that integrates
information about climatic factors, other environmental
stresses, ecological processes, and social-economic-political
inputs and responses.

"Development and validation of integrated mathemat-
ical models for the prediction of health impacts.
Such models must draw on multiple scientific disci-
plines and should take maximal account of regional
and local influences on the effects being modeled
and on their interaction with other environmental
stresses.

Identification and analysis of current or recent set-
tings in which the health impacts of local or regional
climate changes (occurring for whatever reason) can
be studied. The apparent recent changeable patterns of
infectious diseases around the world may afford good
opportunities for clarifying and quantifying the influ-
ences of climatic factors.

al, regional, and local monitoring activities. This

"	List
"Alongside the need for improved health impact assessment
capability is a precautionary need to develop global, region-
al, and local monitoring systems for the early detection of
climate-induced changes in human health. There have,
indeed, been various recent events that, plausibly, might be
early signals of such change. The increased heat-related
deaths in India in 1995; the changes in geographic range of
some vector-borne diseases; the coastal spread of cholera:
Could these be early indications of shifts in population
health risk in response to aspects of climate change? Of
course, it is not possible to attribute particular, isolated
events to a change in climate or weather pattern; other plau-
sible explanations exist for each of them, and a number of
different factors may combine to produce each event.
However, it is important that we begin to assess patterns of
change in the various indices of human health that will pro-
vide early insight and will assist further the development of
predictive modeling.

"	Title
"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
"	Title
"In the energy supply sector, we conclude with a high degree of
confidence that GHG emissions reductions can be achieved
through technology options in the following areas (which have
been ordered according to type of measure rather than priority):
"	Text
"This review focuses on energy supply options that can sharply
reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions while providing needed
energy services. By the year 2100, the world’s commercial ener-
gy system will be replaced at least twice, which offers opportuni-
ties to change the present energy system in step with the normal
timing of the corresponding investments, using emerging tech-
nologies in environmentally sound. ways. Therefore, this assess-
ment focuses on the performance of these emerging technologies.
"	Text
"In addition to climate change concerns, there are several con-
cers of an immediate nature that could be addressed by the
energy supply options discussed here (except carbon sequester-
ing); for example, modern renewable sources of energy are often
beneficial for local and regional environmental problems (e.g.,
urban air pollution, indoor air pollution, and acid rain) and for
some technologies (especially biomass), rural income and
employment ‘generation, and land restoration and preservation.
These energy supply options can be pursued to varying degrees
"	Text
"Since the preparation of the IPCC 1990 Assessment Report,
there have been some significant advances in the understanding
of modern technology and technological innovations relating to
energy systems that can reduce GHG emissions. Examples of
such technologies are found, inter alia, in gas turbine technolo-
gy; coal and biomass gasification technology; production of
transportation fuels from biomass; wind energy utilization;
electricity generation with photovoltaic and solar thermal elec-
tric technologies; approaches to handling intermittent genera-
tion of electricity; fuel cells for transportation and power gener-
ation; nuclear energy; carbon dioxide (CO,) sequestering; and
hydrogen as a major new energy carrier, produced first from
natural gas and later from biomass, coal, and electrolysis.
"	Text
"More efficient conversion of fossil fuels: New tech-
nology offers considerably increased conversion effi-
ciencies. For example, the efficiency of power pro-
duction can be increased from the present world aver-
age of about 30% to more than 60% in the longer
term. Also, the use of combined heat and power pro-
duction replacing separate production of power and
heat—whether for process heat or space heating—
offers a significant rise in fuel conversion efficiency.
Switching to low-carbon fossil fuels and suppressing
emissions: Switching from coal to oil or natural gas, and
from oil to natural gas, can reduce emissions. Natural gas
has the lowest CO, emissions per unit of energy of ail
fossil fuels at ~14 kg/GJ, compared to oil with ~20 kg/GJ
and coal with ~25 kg/GJ. The lower carbon-containing
fuels can, in general, be converted with higher efficien-
cy than coal. Large resources of natural gas exist in many
areas. New, low capital cost, highly efficient, combined-
cycle technology has reduced electricity costs consider-
ably in many areas. Natural gas could potentially replace
oil in the transportation sector. Approaches exist to
reduce emissions of methane from natural gas pipelines
and emissions of methane and/or CO, from oil and gas
wells and coal mines.
"	List
"Decarbonization of flue gases and fuels, and CO,
storage: The removal and storage of CO, from fossil
fuel power-station stack gases is feasible, but reduces
the conversion efficiency and significantly increases
the production cost of electricity. Another approach to
decarbonization uses fossil fuel feedstocks to make
hydrogen-rich fuels. Both approaches generate a
byproduct stream of CO, that could be stored, for
example, in depleted natural gas fields. The future
availability of conversion technologies such as fuel
cells that can efficiently use hydrogen would increase
the relative attractiveness of the latter approach. For
some longer-term CO, storage options, the costs and
environmental effects and their efficacy remain large-
ly unknown.

Increasing the use of nuclear energy: Nuclear ener-
gy could replace baseload fossil fuel electricity gen-
eration in many parts of the world, if generally
acceptable responses can be found to concerns such
as reactor safety, radioactive-waste transport and dis-
posal, and proliferation.

Increasing the use of renewable sources of energy:
Solar, biomass, wind, hydro, and geothermal technolo-
gies already are widely used. In 1990, renewable
sources of energy contributed about 20% of the world’s
primary energy consumption, most of it fuelwood and
hydropower. Technological advances offer new oppor-
tunities and declining costs for energy from these
sources. In the longer term, renewable sources of ener-
gy could meet a major part of the world’s demand for
energy. Power systems can easily accommodate limited
fractions of intermittent generation, and with the addi-
tion of fast-responding backup and storage units, also
higher fractions. Where biomass is sustainably regrown
and used to displace fossil fuels in energy production,
net CO, emissions are avoided, as the CO, released in
energy conversion is again fixed in biomass through
photosynthesis. If the development of biomass energy
can be carried out in ways that effectively address con-
cems about other environmental issues and competition
with other land uses, biomass could make major contri-
butions in both electricity and fuels markets.

"A wide range of modular renewable and other emission-reducing

"To assess the potential impact of combinations of individual mea-
sures at the energy system level, in contrast to the level of indi-

ply system (LESS) are described. The LESS constructions are

"	Text
"Higher energy efficiency is underscored for achieving
deep reductions in CO, emissions, for increasing the
flexibility of supply-side combinations, and for reduc-
ing overall energy system costs.

Interregional trade in energy grows in the LESS con-
structions compared to today’s levels, expanding sus-
tainable development options for Africa, Latin
America, and the Middle East during the next century.
"	List
"Market penetration and continued acceptability of different tech-
nologies ultimately depend on their relative cost, performance
(including environmental performance), institutional arrange-
ments, and regulations and policies. Because costs vary by loca-
tion and application, the wide variety of circumstances creates
initial opportunities for new technologies to enter the market.
Deeper understanding of the opportunities for emissions reduc-
tions would require more detailed analysis of promising clusters
of options, taking into account local conditions. :
"	Text
"Deep reductions of CO, emissions from energy sup-
ply systems are technically possible within 50 to 100
years, using alternative strategies.

Many combinations of the options identified in this
assessment could reduce global CO, emissions from
fossil fuels from about 6 Gt C in 1990 to about 4 Gt C
per year by 2050, and to about 2 Gt C-per year by
2100. Cumulative CO, emissions, from 1990 to 2100,
would range from about 450 to about 470 Gt C in the
alternative LESS constructions.
"	List
"The literature provides strong support for the feasibility of
achieving the performance and cost characteristics assumed for
energy technologies in the LESS constructions, within the next
1 or 2 decades, although it is impossible to be certain until the
research and development is complete and the technologies
have been tested in the market. Moreover, these performance
and cost characteristics cannot be achieved without a strong and
sustained investment in R&D. Many of the technologies being
developed would need initial support to enter the market, and to
reach sufficient volume to lower costs to become competitive.
"	Text
"Some technology options—for example, combined-cycle power
generation—would penetrate the current marketplace. To realize
other options, governments would have to take integrated
action—by improving market efficiency (e.g., by eliminating
permanent subsidies for energy), by finding new ways to inter-
nalize extemal costs, by accelerating RD&D on low- and zero-
CO, emitting technologies, and by providing temporary incen-
tives for early market development for these technologies as they
approach commercial readiness. It is concluded with high confi-
dence that the availability, cost, and penetration of technology
options will strongly depend on such government action.
"	Text
"Costs for energy services in each LESS variant relative to costs
for conventional energy depend on relative future energy
prices, which are uncertain within a wide range, and on the per-
formance and cost characteristics assumed for alternative tech-
nologies. However, within the wide range of future energy
prices, one or more of the variants would plausibly be capable
of providing the demanded energy services at estimated costs
that are approximately the same as estimated future costs for
current conventional energy. It is not possible to identify a
least-cost future energy system for the longer term, as the rela-
tive costs of options depend on resource constraints and tech-
nological opportunities that are imperfectly known, and on
actions by governments and the private sector.
"	Text
"Because of the large number of options, there is flexibility as
to how the energy supply system could evolve, and paths of
energy system development could be influenced by considera-
tions other than climate change, including political, environ-
mental (especially indoor and urban air pollution, acidification,
and need for land restoration), and socioeconomic circum-
stances. Actual strategies for achieving deep reductions might
combine elements from alternative LESS constructions.
Moreover, there may well be other plausible technological
paths that could lead to comparable reductions in emissions.
More work is required to provide a comprehensive under-
standing of the prospects for and implications of alternative
global energy supply systems that would lead to deep reduc-
tions in CO, emissions.
"	Text
"The following assumptions were made: World population grows
from 5.3 billion in 1990 to 9.5 billion by 2050 and 10.5 billion by
2100. GDP grows 7-fold by 2050 (S-fold and 14-fold in industri-
alized and developing countries, respectively) and 24-fold by
2100 (13-fold and 69-fold in industrialized and developing coun-
tries, respectively), relative to 1990. Because of emphasis on
energy efficiency, primary energy rises much more slowly than
GDP. The energy supply constructions were made to meet ener-
gy demand in (i) projections developed for the IPCC’s First
Assessment Report (1990) in a low energy demand variant,
where global primary commercial energy use approximately dou-
bles, with no net change for industrialized countries but a 4.4-fold
increase for developing countries from 1990 to 2100; and (ii) a
higher energy demand variant, based on the IPCC IS92a scenario
where energy demand quadruples from 1990 to 2100. The ener-
gy demand levels of the LESS constructions are consistent with
the energy demand mitigation chapters in this volume.

development programs in various countries, in which
state-of-the-art, higher-efficiency, combined-cycle, gas-fired
stations and coal-fired units operating with supercritical steam
cycles have been installed. Such considerations also have led
to other major development programs—such as Pressurized

"Large-scale fossil fuel-fired power plants generate power in a
steam turbine, a gas turbine, or a combination of the two as a
combined cycle. The global average efficiency of fossil-fueled
power generation is about 30%, and about 35% in the
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) countries (based on higher heating values, HHV). At
a current efficiency of 40%, an increase of 1 percentage point
in the efficiency of power generation results in a 2.5% reduc-
tion of CO, emissions. Figure 19-1 shows the impact of
changes in technology and fuels on emissions (Mills ef al.,
1991), The figure shows that changes in technology can
reduce specific emissions by half and changes in fuel by
another half, yielding emissions about one-quarter of initial
levels.
"	Text
"The world energy supply system is huge, and many of the
installations have economic lifetimes measured in decades.
Annual worldwide investments are on the order of $150 bil-
lion. This means that changes will take considerable time to
implement. However, within a period of 50-100 years, the
entire energy supply system will be replaced at least twice.
New investments to replace an old plant or to expand capac-
ity are opportunities to adopt technologies that are. more
environmentally desirable at low incremental cost.
Significant reductions in GHG emissions will not be
achieved by a few scattered improvements. New technology
must become characteristic for all new investments in order
to reduce net carbon emissions significantly. The technolo-
gies discussed in this chapter are relevant worldwide and
may be introduced more quickly in countries with rapid eco-
nomic growth than in other countries.

that can reduce net GHG emissions. However, it does not
attempt a comprehensive analysis of all options available
for energy system development. There are many ways to
reduce emissions. Some are cost-effective now; others will
become cost-effective within the next decades; and some
options may never be cost-effective, even with massive gov-
ernment support for RD&D and market introduction.
Market penetration of different energy sources ultimately
depends on the relative costs of fossil and alternative ener-
gy forms, as well as other attributes such as abundance,
accessibility, institutional arrangements, and, regulations
and policies that address climate change and other issues.
Because costs vary by location and application, the wide
variety of circumstances creates initial opportunities for
new technologies to enter the market. Deeper understanding
of the opportunities for emissions reductions would require
more detailed analysis of options, taking into account local
conditions. Box 19-1 provides the conventions used
throughout this chapter.

this consumes about 10% of the power produced. On the other

CO, (or carbon black). The latter could be stored; the former piped

suited for such configurations. Potential markets are CHP in resi-

cost of the high-temperature fuel-cell systems. The environmen-
tal performance of these systems probably is not much better
than the performance of conventional power generation with
additional cleaning technologies. Therefore, fuel-cell plants for
large-scale power production will have severe competition from
advanced IGCC and natural gas, combined-cycle power plants.

pollutant emissions. Almost all fuel cells currently developed for
commercialization use pure hydrogen as the fuel. Generally this
implies that a primary fuel—for example, coal, natural gas, or bio-
mass—first has to be converted to a hydrogen-rich gas. Fuel-cell
systems offer the possibility of small-scale as well as large-scale
electricity production at a conversion efficiency from hydrogen
ranging from 40-70% (LHYV) and more than 80% in cogeneration
(de Beer and Nieuwlaar, 1991). Different types of fuel cells are
currently being investigated: the alkaline fuel cell (AFC), phos-
phoric acid fuel cell (PAFC), molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC),
solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), and solid polymer electrolyte fuel
cell (SPEFC) (for an overview, see de Beer and Nieuwlaar, 1991).

ing subsequent cleaning of the gas can contribute significantly
to the increased efficiency of IGCC systems. This does not hold
for systems in which CO, is captured because they are based on
shift conversion of the gas CO content to CO,, and this cannot
be done at such high temperatures. Much technical effort is
being applied in this area. Examples include the development of
high-temperature dust-removal systems such as ceramic filters;
dry desulfurization systems, such as zinc oxide-based adsor-
bents; and solid-based ammonia and alkali metal-removal sys-

"The employment of CHP is closely linked with the availability
or development of district heating (DH) and/or cooling net-
works and building heat and/or cooling distribution systems, as
well as industrial heat loads. DH networks are energy trans-
mission systems suited for the distribution of heat and/or cool-

ties (Kalkum ef al., 1993; Rogner, 1993). Modern water-based

"Fossil fuels, industrial wastes, and waste heat from processes
are used widely in process industries to generate power and
heat. The pulp and paper industry is the largest user of biomass
energy through combustion of waste liquors and other wood
waste. CHP has been utilized in other industries, but to much
lesser extent. Now the situation is changing because of regu-
latory changes (like the Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act
in the United States) and the good economy of cogeneration.
Industrial heat demand often has some special characteristics,
such as large and fast load variations, intermittent need for heat
and power (mechanical work), and extractions of heat (as
steam) at different temperature and pressure levels. Otherwise,
CHP technology is very similar to that in DH except for the use
of special process and waste-heat boilers, where corrosion may
limit the attainable pressure and temperature levels (Saviharju,
1995), Compared with DH plants, the temperature levels of the
extracted heat are higher, which results in much lower power
yields (lower power-to-heat ratio). These may be enhanced
considerably, however, through the use of combined-cycle

because of coal’s high content of ash, sulfur, and other pollu-
tants——direct coal use is a major source of local and regional
air pollution. A substantial reduction in emissions, including
CO,, can be achieved by using coal in more efficient appli-
ances or by converting coal into a synthetic fuel (or electricity

"There are many options for suppressing emissions from the oil
and natural gas industries, including capturing and using or
recompressing residuals and purged gas, improving gas leak-
age-detection methods, applying pneumatic devices to control
or eliminate venting, repairing or replacing pipelines, and
using automatic shutoff valves (U.S. EPA, 1993a). Some of
these measures are capital-intensive and could be difficult to
carry out in some regions, due to specific geographical as well
as economic conditions. Flaring is preferable to venting from
a GHG point of view because a molecule of CH, leads to a
much larger radiative forcing in the atmosphere than a mole-
cule of CO.

"Coal conversion to cleaner fuels—for example, town gas—
essentially eliminates sulfur and particulate emissions at the
point of end-use. Such upstream conversion of coal, however,
is capital-intensive, incurs conversion losses, and requires grid
distribution systems. Because of capital limitations, the direct
use of coal will remain important in many countries for
decades (Sun and Li, 1992). Transferring efficient residential
and industrial coal appliances to developing countries is as
important as transferring coal-cleaning equipment, power gen-
eration plants, and other central conversion plants and equip-

"CH, emissions from coal mining depend on several factors, but
emissions from underground mines are one order of magnitude
higher than from surface mines (Smith and Sloss, 1992). Only
emissions from underground mines can be reduced before (pre-

(gob-well recovery, from the highly fractured area of coal and
tock that is created by caving in of the mine after mining has
been completed) the mining of the coal (U.S. EPA, 1993a).
Whereas premining and postmining degasification has been
widely applied in many countries, it is not suitable for every
coal deposit. The economic feasibility of CH, recovery from
ventilation air has not yet been demonstrated, although tech-
nology is available. In optimal conditions, the combination of
these three options—“integrated recovery”—can achieve an
emissions reduction of up to 80-90% (Blok and de Jager, 1993,

"An estimated average of 0.5% or more of natural-gas production
is emitted into the atmosphere from upstream oil and gas opera-
tions (U.S. EPA, 1990b). In some areas, emissions are assumed
to be as high as 15%, of which 6% is emitted from natural-gas
use. Such high levels of emissions probably will decrease with-
in 20 to 50 years (Picard et al, 1992). Also, many oil production
facilities either produce very small amounts of gas in association
with oil (after satisfying on-site fuel requirements) or are too far
from gas-collecting systems for feasible conservation or reinjec-
tion of the gas. Therefore, gas usually is vented or flared if it is
uncollected. Options for disposing of or utilizing waste gas at oil
production facilities include small-scale on-site power genera-
tion, cogeneration, and transport fuel production. These options
could reduce emissions by 50-99% (Picard and Sarkar, 1993).
The largest reductions of gas venting and flaring from oil and
associated gas facilities would result from making these activi-
ties economically attractive.

"Exploitation of such fields requires removal of CO, to meet

Ordinarily the CO, is emitted to the atmosphere. In the case of
the Sleipner Vest field (9.5% CO,) in Norway, however, the
CO, removed will be injected into an aquifer at 1,000 m below
the main Sleipner platform. Approximately 1 Mt/yr CO, (~0.25
Mt/yr of carbon) will be removed from a 100-bar natural gas
stream, which is costly but uses well-known technology. The
decision to store the CO, was stimulated by the introduction of
a carbon tax of about $180/t C in Norway (Kaarstad, 1992).

"Natural gas is flared to prevent natural gas explosions in the
air, to ensure continuous flow, and to keep production smooth
in the downstream facilities. Options to reduce the volumes
flared in continuous gas flows include using nitrogen as a
purge gas and recovery of low-pressure gas. Gas flaring
caused by faults in processing could be reduced by improving
maintenance. Improving system reliability and storage capac-
ity may reduce emissions of excess gas flared when demand is
low. These options vary according to the location and charac-
teristics of the oil industry.

"If deep CO, emission reductions are desired, it would be nec-
essary to extend the effort beyond power generation. This is
problematic, however, because most fuels used directly are
consumed in small-scale conversion systems in which decar-
bonization is not practical. This problem might be solved by
converting the fossil fuel to a low-carbon, hydrogen-rich fuel
or to a carbon-free fuel (essentially hydrogen) and CO, in a
centralized facility, followed by removal of the CO, and distri-
bution of the low-carbon or carbon-free fuel to the consumer
(Marchetti, 1989; Blok et al., 1995; Williams, 1996).

"The capture of CO, from the flue gases of fossil fuel-fired
power plants and its subsequent use or disposal is being active-
ly investigated in a number of countries (Blok et al., 1992;
Riemer, 1993; U.S. DOE, 1993; Herzog and Drake, 1993;
Aresta et al., 1993; Kondo et al., 1995). Interest in the capture
of CO, from power plant flue gases started before it was seen
as a GHG mitigation option. The driving force was the desire
for an inexpensive, readily available source of CO, to use in
enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Three such plants were built in
the United States to provide CO, for EOR using natural gas as
a primary fuel. Another plant, still in operation, uses coal as a
source of CO, for the production of soda ash. All of these
plants have applied well-established technology to capture the
CO, from the flue gases.

"The CO, content in natural gas fields or oil wells varies, which
significantly affects life-cycle CO, emissions. Depending on
the ratio of CH, to other gases, the extraction and use of natur-
al gas leads to CO, emissions of less than 14 kg C/GJ of nat-
ural gas (HHV) if the CO, content of the natural gas field is
less than about 1%. Most fields exploited presently are in this
range (Schroder and Schneich, 1986)—for example, the
Groningen field in The Netherlands, which contains 0.89%
CO, (Blok et al., 1989). However, there are also natural gas
fields with a much higher CO, content. For example, the
Krahnberg field in Germany contains 53.4% CO, and the

twice as much carbon can be stored as CO, in depleted reser-

"Due to the increased costs of the hydrogen fuel compared to

decarbonization processes are inherently expensive. For the
recovery of CO, by steam reforming of natural gas, they cal-
culate costs ranging from $210 to $460/t C recovered
(Kagoja et al., 1993). It has been suggested that hydrogen has
a greater value than the feedstock from which it is produced
because it allows the use of more efficient conversion tech-
nologies. The costs of decarbonizing fuels therefore must be
assessed at the systems level. For example, the production of
hydrogen from natural gas or coal and its use in a fuel-cell
vehicle typically would lead to lower primary energy con-
sumption than if gasoline derived from crude oil were used in
a comparable vehicle (see Section 19.2.6.4). At present, the
least costly way to produce hydrogen often involves the use
of natural gas as the feedstock; in the process, a stream of
pure CO, is produced as a byproduct. If this CO, could be
captured and stored in a nearby exhausted natural-gas field,
the costs of avoiding the CO, emissions are estimated to be

"The technology to capture CO, is available, but to have an
impact on GHG emissions, credible and environmentally
acceptable utilization, storage, and/or disposal options are
required. Because of the small potential for utilization (Aresta
et al., 1993; Herzog and Drake, 1993), several possibilities for
underground storage or ocean disposal of CO, are being inves-
tigated. An overview of storage options is presented in Table
19-3, together with an indication of their potential capacities
based on low estimates in the literature. Enhanced oil recovery
(EOR) using CO, as a miscible flooding agent has a high
potential. The CO, is partly stored during the recovery of the
oil. At present oil price levels, however, the application of CO,
in EOR is not profitable unless there is access to CO, from a
cheap source, such as a natural underground source. Examples
can be found in the United States, where CO, from natural
sources is transported hundreds of kilometers by pipeline for
EOR use. For a typical case, total pipeline transportation cost
of CO, is about $8/t C for a 250-km, 750-mm pipeline for 5.5
Mt C of CO, per year (Skovholt, 1993). EOR using CO, from
power plants might reduce the annual anthropogenic CO,
emissions by about 1% (Taber, 1993).

"One frequently suggested scheme for decarbonization of fuels
is the development of an IGCC power plant with CO, removal.
In this scheme, the gasifier off-gas is converted with steam to
CO, and hydrogen (via H,O + CO—> CO, + H,) and then sep-
arated to make a fuel gas stream that is essentially hydrogen.
Due to its high partial pressure, the CO, can be recovered by
using a physical solvent for which regeneration requires only a
release of pressure. After separation, the hydrogen-rich fuel is
burned in a combined cycle to generate electricity. The CO,
emission factor of the fuel would be smaller than 4 kgC/GJ,
compared with 24 kgC/GJ for coal. Starting from an original
IGCC plant with a coal-to-electricity efficiency of about 44%
(LHV), this efficiency might decrease to about 37%, with the
CO, emissions reduced from approximately 200 gC/kWh to
less than 25 gC/kWh. Due to the recovery, the costs of electric-
ity production might increase by 30-40%. The removal costs
would then be less than $80/t C avoided (Hendriks et al, 1993;
Hendriks, 1994). These penalties might be reduced substantial-
ly if the gasification of coal and the recovery of CO, were inte-
grated with the use of fuel cells to generate electricity. Such a
configuration could result in a higher conversion efficiency
(42-47%, LHV) (Jansen et al., 1992).

"The deep ocean is the largest potential repository for CO,. The
oceans contain about 38,000 Gt C and will eventually absorb,
after equilibration, perhaps 85% of the CO, that is released to
the atmosphere from energy conversion processes (Houghton
et al., 1990). CO, could be transferred directly to the oceans,
ideally at a depth of perhaps 3,000 m—from where it would
take at least several hundred years before it partly escaped to
the atmosphere. Concern over potential environmental
impacts, the practical limitations on pipeline depth, and the
assurance of adequate retention time suggest that injection at
1,000 m at carefully selected sites could be a realistic option.
Costs are probably marginally higher than for subterranean dis-
posal (U.S. DOE, 1993), but—as with most options—the cost
of transporting CO, to the disposal site often dominates.

"Another option is storage in saline aquifers (i.e., permeable beds,
mostly sandstone), which can be found at different depths all over
the world. First estimates of their storage capacity range from
about 90 to about 2,500 Gt C, due to different assumptions about
the volume of aquifers, the percentage of the reservoir to be filled,
the density of CO, under reservoir conditions, and the area suit-
able for CO, storage (Riemer, 1993; Hendriks et al., 1993).
Depending on the availability of compressed CO,—for example,
from an IGCC plant with CO, removal—and other local circum-
stances, the costs of underground storage onshore might vary from
about $7 to $30/t C, transportation costs excluded (Hendriks,

This income could allow developing-country farmers to mod-

Low sulfur content gives biomass a processing cost advantage
compared with coal. In addition, if the biomass gasifier is
designed to exploit the much higher reactivity of biomass com-
pared to coal, unit capital costs can be reduced. For both coal
and biomass, the initial step involves gasification to produce a
synthesis gas (mainly CO and H,). Coal is gasified in oxygen
to produce the desired synthesis gas. The high gasification tem-
peratures needed are achieved by direct heating—that is, by
burning some of the coal in place. To take advantage of
economies of scale for the oxygen plant, the coal conversion
facilities would be large. Because of its much higher reactivi-
ty, biomass can be gasified at much lower temperatures—a
property that makes it possible to avoid the use of costly oxy-
gen-blown gasifiers and instead to gasify the biomass in steam
using indirectly heated gasifiers in smaller facilities.

"The technology related to grid-connected wind turbines has
become commercially available and mature. The most suc-
cessful commercial wind turbines have installed capacities of
up to 600 kW. A new generation of machines in the 1 MW
size range and above is now being investigated. At the end of
1993, the global installed capacity of high-efficiency wind
turbines was 3,100 MW, of which approximately 1,700 MW
is in the Americas and 1,200 MW in Europe. While many dif-
ferent designs are in use, the “stock average” technology con-
sists of three-bladed, horizontal-axis machines operating at
near-fixed rotation speed. In 1993, the global new installation
of wind energy was on the order of 550 MW; the annual man-
ufacturing capacity was over 1,000 MW. This capacity could
increase rapidly due to the decentralized structure of produc-
tion in the wind power industry. Technical availability (the
capability to operate when the wind is higher than the start-
ing wind speed of the machine) is now typically 95-99%.
Small-scale applications of wind energy such as water pump-
ing, battery charging, and stand-alone electricity supply sys-
tems also are being developed (Cavallo et al., 1993; WEC,

"Advanced biofuels: Advanced biofuels derived from low-cost
woody biomass could offer higher energy yields at lower cost
and with lower environmental impacts than most traditional
biofuels (IEA, 1994b), The advanced biofuel that has received
the most attention is ethanol derived from wood via enzymatic
hydrolysis (Wyman ef al., 1993). For a woody feedstock yield
of 15 dry t/ha/yr—which is generally believed to be achievable
in large-scale production—the ethanol yield could be more
than twice that from grain (Table 19-4). If the U.S. Department
of Energy’s year-2000 goals for performance and cost are met,
energy balances would be favorable; life-cycle emissions of
CO, for ethanol production and use in ICEVs (in gC/km)
would be only about 2% of those from such vehicles operated
on reformulated gasoline (Wyman et al., 1993). Furthermore,
ethanol will be competitive with gasoline if oil prices are
greater than about $25/bbI (Wyman et al., 1993). For compar-
ison, French studies indicate that ethanol from grain will not be
competitive until oil prices reach $40-45/bbi (Torck et al.,
1988), The major shortcoming of the technology is that it may
not lead to air-quality improvements beyond what can be
achieved with reformulated gasoline. However, low emissions,
along with a two to three-fold gain in fuel economy, might be
practically achievable using either fuel with a so-called hybrid
car that has an electric drive train, an electric generator driven
by a small internal-combustion engine that would provide
baseload power, and a small battery or other device for provid-
ing peak power (Ross, 1994; Colombo and Farinelli, 1994).

"Intermittent wind power on a large grid can contribute an esti-
mated 15-20% of annual electricity production without spe-
cial arrangements (see also Section 19.2.6.1). In large utility
systems with a small fraction of wind power, savings in fuels
and emissions are approximately proportional to the average
wind energy input. Employing the so-called loss-of-load-
expectation method, the capacity value is typically found to be
close to that of a conventional thermal plant with the same
energy output at low levels of wind power penetration (supply
fraction) and to decline with increasing penetration (van Wijk,
1990; Tande and Hansen, 1991; Grubb and Meyer, 1993).
Energy storage facilities probably will be integrated into the
utility system, which would allow efficient utilization of wind
energy at high penetrations. The wind energy and the storage
facility together may supply “firm” power actually substitut-
ing for baseload power (Cavallo, 1995; Cavallo and Keck,

"The societal cost of research, development, and commercializa-

from being commercially attractive in large-scale applications.
How fast costs come down in the future depends on the level of
the societal commitment to develop the technology. Williams
and Terzian (1993) conclude that it would be worthwhile to
accelerate rapidly the pace of development via intensification of
the R&D effort and market incentives because the public-sector
costs involved are expected to be small compared with the direct
societal benefits, measured as the present value of reduced future
consumer expenditures on electricity. Williams and Terzian
(1993) estimate the public-sector subsidy to develop 400 GW, of
installed PV capacity worldwide by 2020 to be $1 billion/yr for
more R&D in the early years, plus a present value of $3.3 billion
for future market incentives. These estimates are similar to those
made by the World Energy Council in estimating what would be
required to commercialize PV technologies: a market stimula-
tion incentive of $2.5-4.0 billion, plus another $5 billion for
R&D (WEC, 1994). These costs are very small compared with
the costs of commercializing fossil and nuclear technologies,
largely because of the small scale of the technology.

large unit sizes. Many of the smaller-scale technologies will be
sited not in central-station plants but at or near customers’

Electricity produced from such “distributed power systems” is
worth more to the utility than central-station power whenever

"5 Since this SUTIL modeling exercise was carried out, present and
projected fuel prices and technology costs have changed signifi-

tion costs of $525/kW and $625/kW for conventional and advanced
natural gas combined cycle plants, respectively, combined cycle
plants are being installed at present in the U.S. at costs as low as
$400/kW. As a sensitivity analysis, the SUTIL model was run again
with assumed coal and natural gas prices of $1.3/GJ and $3.2/GJ,
respectively [equal to national average prices projected for electric
utilities in the U.S. in the year 2010 by the U.S. Department of

[an estimated long-run marginal cost for producing 5 EJ/yr of plan-
tation biomass in the U.S. using biomass production technology
projected for the year 2020 (Graham et al., 1995)], together with
the original SUTIL technology cost assumptions. Although overall
generation cost levels are lower with these new fuel price assump-
tions, the relative costs of alternative investment portfolios differ
only modestly from those shown in Figure 19-4. For example, the
average generation cost for the updated version of case 9 is 8%

renewable equipment, the load-leveling capabilities of hydroelectric facilities, and the dispatching of natural gas, coal, and biomass thermal elec-

out the year. The assumed insolation values are for northern California. For the given demand profile, alternative electricity supply portfolios
having the same degree of system reliability were constructed. Each portfolio involves specified levels of penetration by intermittent renewable
electric and hydroelectric sources, and the model determines the least costly mix of thermal-electric equipment and fuels that would meet the
remaining load, assuming alternative levels of technology for the thermal generating equipment and specified 30-year levelized life-cycle fuel
prices. For all advanced fossil and renewable energy technologies highlighted in these constructions, it was assumed that R&D is successful in
meeting performance and cost goals for the period near 2010. Thirty-year levelized coal, natural gas, and biomass prices were assumed to be
$2.0/GJ, $4.4/GJ, and $2.4/GJ, respectively. Assumptions about capital and operations and maintenance costs, and about performance character-

transmission. Ohmic losses amount to about 4% of the energy
transmitted per 1,000 km, while losses associated with DC/AC
conversion amount to about 0.6-0.8% per station. Typically,
DC transmission increases the cost of electricity about 7% for
a 1,000-km line. The low losses and relatively low costs of
long-distance DC transmission make it feasible to transport
solar power across multiple time zones and to exploit good

"Hydrogen can be produced from any fossil fuel or from biomass
via thermochemical conversion and from any electricity source
via electrolysis. Conversion to hydrogen and sequestration of
separated CO, makes it possible to use fossil fuels with modest
life-cycle CO, emissions (see Sections 19.2.3.2 and 19.2.3.3).
Emissions from the production of hydrogen from biomass
grown on a sustainable basis would be especially low and neg-
ative if the separated CO, were sequestered. For the foreseeable
future, thermochemically derived hydrogen will be much less
costly than electrolytic hydrogen, even taking into account the
costs of sequestering the separated CO, (see Figure 19-5).

"As is the case for any synthetic fuel, hydrogen generally will
cost more to produce than conventional hydrocarbon fuels.
Natural gas-derived hydrogen (the least-costly option for at
least the next couple of decades) delivered to consumers is
likely to be much more costly than gasoline, on a dollar per GJ
basis—50% higher for energy prices expected for the United
States in 2010 (see Figure 19-5). However, this cost penalty
does not imply that hydrogen would not be competitive. The
choice of energy carrier, its price, and its source are of little
concern to the consumer. The consumer cares about the quali-
ty and cost of the energy services provided (Scott, 1993). Just
as electricity is competitive as an energy carrier—even though
it is much more expensive than coal, oil, or natural gas—high-
cost hydrogen could be competitive if the market were to place
a high value on hydrogen. It would be difficult for hydrogen to

"Although costs for technologies that are not yet commercially
available cannot be known precisely, it is plausible—on the
basis of what is presently known about the prospective costs of
advanced renewable and fossil fuel electric-generating tech-
nologies—that in the early decades of the next century, utility
planners will be able to assemble alternative electric power
systems (involving substantial contributions from renewable
energy sources) that generate very low CO, emissions. These
judgments are based on the assumption that various promising
renewable-energy technologies will be targeted for R&D and
commercialization programs. At the same time, of course,
advances will continue to be made in fossil fuel technologies.
In many cases, it will be difficult to provide electricity at lower
direct cost than with fossil fuels (for example, because both
coal and biomass will be able to exploit the same basic
advances in gas turbine and fuel-cell conversion technologies).

"Since it was first introduced, electricity has accounted for a
growing share of the energy carriers used in the energy econo-
my—a trend that is expected to continue. For the longer term,
hydrogen is another high-quality energy carrier that society
might adopt for large-scale applications. Both electricity and
hydrogen offer good prospects for simultaneously dealing with
the challenges facing the energy system in the 21st century—
local, regional, and global environmental challenges, as well as
security of energy supply (Marchetti, 1989; Rogner and
Britton, 1991; Leydon and Glocker, 1992). Both are clean, ver-
satile, and easy to use and can be derived from a wide range of
primary energy sources. Because of their very different char-
acteristics, hydrogen and electricity would have complemen-
tary roles in the energy economy. Hydrogen can be stored in
any quantity, but electricity cannot (though this could change if
high-temperature superconductivity could be successfully
developed). Electricity can transmit energy without moving
material; hydrogen cannot. Hydrogen can be a chemical or
material feedstock; electricity cannot. Electricity can process,
transmit, and store information; hydrogen cannot.

"All configurations involving advanced technology
(cases 3-10) are less costly than the base case (case 1),
which involves conventional fossil fuel technologies.
There is little variation in cost among the advanced tech-
nology options, although there are no less costly options
than the advanced fossil fuel options (cases 3 and 4).
The fraction of electrical energy provided by inter-
mittents can rise up to about 30%, without the use of
new electrical storage technology, before costs start
rising significantly.

At high levels of penetration of intermittent renew-
ables, baseload thermal power becomes less impor-
tant and load-following and peaking power become
more important.

The advanced fossil fuel options offer relatively mod-
est reductions in CO, emissions.

The option offering the greatest reduction in CO,
emissions [case 9, involving biomass for baseload
power and a 30% contribution from intermittent
renewables and for which emissions are only 4% of
those for the least costly case (case 4)] has an average
generation cost that is only 7% higher than for the
least costly case.

Applications, with a Comparison to Gasoline Derived from Crude Oil—This figure and Figures 19-6 and 19-7 present alternative measures of cost
and life-cycle CO, emissions characteristics for systems that provide H, derived from natural gas (via steam reforming), coal and biomass (via
thermochemical gasification), and electrolytic sources, with comparisons to gasoline (Williams, 1996). Costs were calculated assuming a 10% dis-
count rate, and fuel taxes were excluded, The assumed crude oil, natural gas, and coal prices are, respectively, the world oil price, the U.S. average
wellhead price, and the average U.S. electric utility price projected for 2010 by U.S. DOE (EIA, 1995). The consumer gasoline price is for refor-
mulated gasoline, which is estimated to be 16% higher than the price of ordinary gasoline derived from crude at the assumed price of $22/barrel-
Plantation biomass prices that are comparable to or lower than the assumed price could be realized in large-scale applications in Brazil today and
in the U.S. by 2020 if yield and cost goals for 2020 are realized as a result of successful R&D (see Section 19.2.5.2.1). The assumed electricity
costs are for a 600 MW advanced passively safe nuclear plant having an installed cost of $1680/kW (EPRI, 1993); for post-2000 wind technology
with an installed cost of $780/kW (Ogden and Nitsch, 1993); and for photovoltaic (pv) systems in areas with high insolation and installed costs of
$550-1125 per kW—targets that plausibly could be met using advanced thin-film pv technologies in the long term (Ogden and Nitsch, 1993).
Thermochemical production of H, generates a byproduct stream of pure CO,, which can either be released to the atmosphere or compressed and
piped to a site where it might be sequestered. The first bar for natural gas, coal, and biomass is the cost when this CO, is vented; the second and
third bars are for when the separated CO, is sequestered, assuming low and high estimates of the sequestering cost (Hendriks, 1994), In the natural
gas cases, it is assumed that the H, plant is located near a natural gas field and that the separated CO, is sequestered in depleted gas wells. For the
coal and biomass cases, it is assumed that the separated CO, is sequestered in saline aquifers located 250 km from the plant. The numbers at the
tops of the bars are the life-cycle CO, emissions in kg C per GJ of delivered fuel, relative to life-cycle emissions for gasoline. :

H, would increase only modestly, if the CO, separated at the H,
production plant were isolated from the atmosphere and the extra
cost of sequestering this CO, were charged to the consumer.

7 Moreover, because the cost of fuel represents such a small fraction of
the total cost of owning and operating a fuel-cell car, the total life-
cycle cost for a fuel-cell car operated on electrolytic hydrogen would
be less than 7% more than for a gasoline internal combustion engine
car, even though the cost of electrolytic hydrogen per km for a PEM

only commercial technologies. The prospective performance

"Emphasis in the LESS constructions is on the long term
(2025-2100), the prospects for achieving deep reductions in
CO, emissions from the energy sector with alternative supply
mixes, and prospective costs. The need for a long-term focus is
stressed in the Working Group I evaluations. Accordingly,
emphasis was given to new or improved energy supply tech-
nologies that offer the potential for achieving deep reductions
in emissions. By the year 2100, the global commercial energy
system will have been replaced two to three times—providing
many opportunities to change system performance through the
use of various new technologies at the time of investment, both
for capacity expansion and for replacement.

"To help clarify the options, alternative versions of the LESS
were constructed with features that make each option marked-
ly different from the others, and some important features dis-
tinguishing the alternatives are highlighted. In the bottom-up
constructions, focused attention is given to five LESS variants.
Four variants involve a high degree of emphasis on the effi-
cient use of energy. Two of these—which were analyzed in the
greatest detail, thus taken to be the reference cases—are a bio-
mass-intensive (BI) variant and a nuclear-intensive (NI) vari-
ant. Also, a natural gas-intensive (NGI) variant and a coal-
intensive (CI) variant were constructed to explore the extent to
which deep reductions in emissions could be achieved using
more fossil fuels. A fifth high-demand (HD) variant explores
the implication of much greater energy demand growth.

"A class of technologies that could make a hydrogen economy
feasible is represented by the fuel cell, which converts fuel
directly into electricity without first burning it. The hydrogen
fuel cell offers the potential for major contributions in trans-
portation (Williams, 1993; Mark et al., 1994) and in distributed
combined heat and power applications (A.D. Little, 1995;
Dunnison and Wilson, 1994). The hydrogen fuel cell offers
high thermodynamic performance, zero local air-pollution
emissions, low maintenance requirements, and quiet operation.
In mass production, automobiles powered by the proton
exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell would have much lower
costs and much longer ranges between refuelings than battery-
powered electric cars (Kircher et al., 1994; Ogden et al., 1994).
Powered by either compressed hydrogen or methanol (a hydro-
gen carrier that would be “reformed” onboard the vehicle into
a suitable hydrogen-rich gaseous fuel), PEM fuel-cell cars
would require much less fuel and emit much less local pollu-
tion than hybrid -internal-combustion engine/battery-powered
cars, while offering comparable or greater range and compara-

using the SUTIL model with considerations of regionally vary-

photovoltaic, and solar thermal-electric technologies) and
advanced biomass electric-generating technologies (biomass-
integrated gasifier/gas turbine technologies through 2025 and
biomass-integrated gasifier/fuel-cell technologies for 2050 and

fueled with natural gas-derived hydrogen also are stressed. The

"Key to the economics of the BI variant are assumptions about
relative fuel prices. The results of the SUTIL modeling exer-
cise shown in Figure 19-4 are for electric utility fossil fuel
prices projected by the U.S. Department of Energy (U.S.
DOE) for the United States in the period near 2010-(Kelly and
Weinberg, 1993). Since that modeling exercise was carried
out, the coal price projected by U.S. DOE for U.S. electric
utilities in 2010 has fallen from $2.0/GJ to $1.3/GJ. This
reduction in coal price implies a 15% reduction in the busbar
cost for the advanced coal power-generation technology to
which the advanced biomass power-generation technology
was compared in Figure 19-4. Such a sharp drop in coal prices
makes it much more difficult for biomass to compete.
However, more detailed estimates of future plantation biomass
costs have been made since the modeling exercise illustrated
in Figure 19-4 was carried out (Graham ef al., 1995; Turnure
et al., 1995), indicating that biomass prices of $1.5-1.8/GJ
could be expected in the U.S. for plantation production levels

"The central result of this analysis—that deep reductions in
emissions from the power sector are achievable with the BI
variant—would not be qualitatively changed by making a sig-
-hificant change in an individual component of the power sup-
ply. Consider, for example, the hydropower contribution. By
2050, hydropower generation increases 2.2-fold relative to
1990 and then remains constant. Although this is only 50-80%
of the estimated economically exploitable potential (Moreira
and Poole, 1993), large hydropower projects are increasingly
being challenged on social and environmental grounds.
Cutting the hydro increment by half between 1990 and 2050
might be compensated by a 14% increase in the contribution
from intermittent renewables by 2050 without fundamentally
changing the basic structure of the BI variant and with no
increase in global emissions. If the cut in the increment were
compensated instead by natural gas power generation, global
gas supply requirements in 2050 would go up only 7%, and
global emissions would increase only 0.12 Gt C/yr (if the gas
were not decarbonized) or 0.03 Gt C/yr (if it were).

recent modeling exercise carried out by the Energy Modeling

be lower still, as projected in some private forecasts
(DRI/McGraw-Hill, 1995), and if biomass conversion tech-
nologies turn out to be less efficient and more capital-inten-

"Because the power sector is largely decarbonized in the next
century under the BI variant (with CO, emissions amounting to
only 0.06 Gt C/yr in 2100), it is assumed that the energy con-
tributions from fossil fuels are identical for the NI and BI vari-
ants. Thus, the NI variant represents an alternative way to
achieve the LESS reference case level of CO, emissions reduc-
tion from the power sector. It involves a major expansion of
nuclear power along with a lesser (but still substantial) contri-
bution from renewable electric sources than with the BI vari-
ant. The projections for nuclear electric capacity and genera-
tion worldwide in the long term would be technically feasible
but would require the removal of policy barriers such as mora-
toria on construction, political decisions to abandon nuclear

"It is assumed for all the LESS constructions that low-temperature

Although hydrogen is the preferred fuel for fuel-cell vehicles,
it is assumed for the LESS constructions that in the early

methanol (see Figure 19-12), an easy-to-use liquid fuel that
poses fewer challenges to the infrastructure than hydrogen.
For applications to fuel-cell vehicles, the costs per kilometer of
driving to the consumer for methanol derived from natural gas
and biomass would be comparable to the costs for hydrogen
derived from these fuels (Williams et al., 1995a, 1995b)—and
thus to the cost of gasoline derived from crude oil in this peri-

"At the back end of the fuel cycle, the management of spent fuel
would require interim storage capacities and the implementa-

Nuclear power plants currently generate about 5 tons of spent
fuel per TWh of electricity. With the development of advanced
reactors, this quantity will decrease. The NI variant would lead
to some 6.3 million tons of accumulated spent fuel by 2100
with current technologies. Efficiency improvements in nuclear
fuel utilization—for example, higher burn-up—and. deploy-
ment of advanced fission reactors are likely to reduce the
amount of spent fuel. Because the deployment of breeder reac-
tors is assumed for the NI variant, most spent fuel would be
reprocessed, and the volume of high-level waste created would
be on the order of 1 m3/GW,/yr. The accumulated volumes to
be disposed of would be some 200,000 m3 by 2100.

"The World Energy Council projects (WEC, 1994) in its Current Policies Scenario for global energy that tradi-
tional (noncommercial) biomass energy use increases from 42 EJ in 1990 to 59 EJ in 2020 and that modern
(commercial) biomass energy increases from 5 to 11 EJ. For the WEC Ecologically Driven Scenario (EDS),
however, these totals for 2020 are 47 EJ and 25 EJ, respectively [compared to a total biomass energy use rate
(all commercial) of 74 EJ/yr in 2025 for the BI variant of the LESS); the projected 5.5%/yr growth rate for
modern biomass energy use, 1990-2020, is regarded as a plausible but ambitious growth schedule, considering
all of the new technologies involved and the institutional hurdles that must be overcome.

Dessus et al. (1992) project total world biomass use as 135 EJ in 2020, of which 51% and 17%, respectively,
are accounted for by commercial and noncommercial wood recovered from forests, 20% by biomass waste
resources, and 12% by biomass crops grown on plantations. Dessus et al. (1992) apparently focus their expan-
sion on biomass from forests because this large potential resource might be the most easily exploited potential
biomass supply.

The U.S, Environmental Protection Agency advances a scenario for a greenhouse-constrained world (Rapidly
Changing World with Stabilizing Policies) in which the role of commercial biomass energy increases to 136 EJ
by 2025 and to 215 EJ by 2050 (Lashof and Tirpak, 1990).

In their Renewables-Intensive Global Energy Scenario (RIGES), Johansson et al. (1993a) project the biomass
contribution (all commercial) to be 145 EJ by 2025 and 206 EJ by 2050; plantations account for 55-62% of the
total, while forests account for only 5—7%. In the RIGES, the use of modernized biomass was projected to
grow rapidly (10%/yr, 1990-2025) because of the multiple benefits it offers.

In its 1994 long-term global energy scenario exercise, the Shell International Petroleum Company developed a
“Sustained Growth” scenario in which it projects that by 2050—as in the BI variant of the LESS—more than
half of total world primary energy comes from renewable energy sources. (The projected overall level of
renewable energy development is twice the level in the BI variant of the LESS, however, because the overall
projected level of energy demand is about twice as high at that time.) In this scenario, the overall contribution
from biomass in 2050 is about 15% higher than in the BI variant of the LESS, although about 30% of total bio-
mass in the Shell scenario is for noncommercial uses (Kassler, 1994),

of these resources are used up by the year 2100. In this case,
global natural gas production increases to a level 2.3 times the
1990 level by the year 2050 before global production declines
at a constant exponential rate.

"The separated CO, might be sequestered in saline aquifers or
in depleted oil and gas fields (Williams, 1996). Because the
cost of the coal or biomass contributes such a small amount to
the overall cost of making hydrogen (see Figure 19-5) or
methanol (Williams et al., 1995a, 1995b), it would not change
the overall economics very much to ship the coal or biomass to
a depleted natural gas field site for processing.
"	Text
"Annual CO, emissions would fall to 2 Gt C/yr by the year 2100
(see Figure 19-9), and cumulative emissions between 1990 and
2100 would be 476 Gt C (see Figure 19-10)—only slightly
more than in the reference cases, Cumulative requirements
from 1990 to 2100 for sequestering the CO, recovered in
hydrogen production would be nearly three times as large as in
the reference cases (44 Gt C vs. 17 Gt C), but this is small com-
pared with the sequestering capacity of natural gas fields that
would be theoretically available by 2100 via natural gas extrac-
tion (see Section 19.2.3).
"	Text
"This variant offers considerably greater potential for reducing
dependence on biomass than is feasible for the NGI variant (see
Figure 19-11) because of the specification that CO, recovered at
hydrogen and methanol conversion facilities be sequestered for
biomass as well as coal feedstocks. Costs would be slightly
higher because of the added complications of sequestering CO,
recovered at coal and biomass fuel-processing facilities, but
costs for demanded energy services could plausibly still qualify
as being approximately the same as estimated future costs for
current conventional energy (see Figure 19-6).
"	Text
"Another strategy for achieving deep reductions involves using
coal and biomass for methanol and hydrogen production, along
with sequestration of the CO, separated out at the synthetic
fuel production facilities. This strategy is pursued in a way that
emphasizes the use of coal relative to biomass, subject to the
constraint that the overall level of annual CO, emissions is the
same as for the NGI variant. It is assumed that for this coal-
intensive (CI) variant, all characteristics of the variant other
than for methanol and hydrogen production are identical to
those for the BI variant (for example, reference-case assump-
tions about remaining natural gas resources).
"	Text
"Remaining recoverable natural gas resources are sub-
stantially higher than in the reference cases.

All of the natural gas in excess of that for the refer-
ences cases is used to make methanol and hydrogen.
These displace methanol and hydrogen that would
otherwise be produced from plantation biomass in the
BI variant to the extent that this is feasible at the high-
er production levels of natural gas.

Hydrogen production for this extra natural gas is car-
ried out near depleted natural gas fields, so the stream
of CO, recovered at the hydrogen production facility
can be sequestered there (see Figure 19-5).

The energy demand levels and structures are the same
as for the BI variant.

Except for the shift from biomass to natural gas for
the production of methanol and hydrogen, the energy
supply mix is the same as for the BI variant.

"If agricultural production can be modernized and intensified in
environmentally acceptable ways, however, large increases in
cropland probably will not be needed for food production (e.g.,
Waggoner, 1994; Smil, 1994). Indeed, low-cost bioenergy could
attract industry to rural areas to provide the income growth
needed to modernize agriculture (see Section 19.2.5.2).
Preliminary analyses indicate good prospects in Brazil for
large-scale development of bioenergy plantations without seri-
ous competition from food production (Carpentieri et al., 1993).
Even in densely populated India, it has been suggested that
some 60-70 million hectares of degraded lands might be good
for energy plantations. In India, the potential conflict with food
production is not expected to be great. Between 1970 and 1990,
food production per capita increased while the total land area
under cultivation stayed about the same, despite a 60% growth
in population. Also, there are good prospects for substantial fur-
ther gains in food crop yields (Ravindranath and Hail, 1994).
Moreover, a preliminary country-by-country analysis exploring
the potential for biomass energy production in the context of
future food requirements in the developing world projects that
there could reasonably be considerable amounts of land com-
mitted to biomass energy production in Africa, Asia, and Latin
America without posing major conflicts with food production in
the period to the year 2025 (Larson et ai., 1995), Further inves-
tigations of these issues are needed, however.

ed by hydrogen derived by thermochemical means from natur-
al gas, biomass, and coal (see Figure 19-12), with sequestering
of the CO, recovered at the fuel-conversion plants. By 2050
and beyond, the HD variant uses as much primary biomass
energy as in the BI variant and as much natural gas as in the
NGI variant. The extent of sequestration is dictated by a
requirement that annual CO, emissions not exceed those for
the NGI variant (see Figure 19-9).
"	Text
"Two important lessons are highlighted by this variant. First, the
production of hydrogen-rich fuels for fuel-cell applications
allows coal to have a significant role as an energy source in a
GHG-constrained world. Second, in this strategy, coal and bio-
mass play complementary roles. Having some biomass in the
energy system allows greater use of coal because for biomass
grown on a sustainable basis with sequestration of the CO, sep-
arated at the conversion facilities, net life-cycle CO, emissions
are negative (see Figure 19-5).

"Coal use increases 5-fold between 1990 and 2100 (see Figure
19-8); annual sequestration requirements increase from 0 in
2025 to 2.0 Gt C/yr in 2050 and 11.6 Gt C/yr in 2100.
Cumulative sequestration requirements from 1990 to 2100
amount to 321 Gt C. In principle, sequestering might be
accomplished entirely in natural gas fields until the year 2100
(Williams, 1995a). However, additional secure storage capaci-
ty would be needed to continue sequestering CO, at high rates
and to maintain low emissions levels with continued intensive
use of coal well beyond the year 2100.

"To test the robustness of the bottom-up energy supply analysis
indicating that deep reductions in CO, emissions could be
realized by 2100, a top-down global energy modeling analysis
also was carried out for the Working Group (Edmonds er al.,

some of the key energy technologies used in the construction

explores the potential for achieving deep reductions in emis-

trends in the period beyond 2025. Overall demand for fuels
used directly and for electricity are equal to those for the refer-

intermittent renewables. In principle, all of the incremental

"Two of the options (cases 5 and 6) are characterized by about
the same level of CO, emissions as the LESS reference case in
2100 [compare Figure 19-15 (top) with Figure 19-9], even
though their primary energy-use levels at that time are very dif-

develop renewable technologies at a rapid rate because the
benefits are distant and not easily captured by individual firms;
they also will not invest in large volumes of commercially
available technologies to the extent justified by the external

"It is important to have a government energy R&D strategy that

the smali scale and modularity of these technologies and the
fact that they are generally clean and safe (Williams, 1995b).
As a result, it should be feasible, even with limited resources
for R&D, to support a diversified portfolio of options. It has

"Regarding specific industry emissions, energy-intensive indus-
tries such as chemicals, cement, and steel have shown substan-
tial improvements in energy efficiency during the past 20 years,
albeit unevenly in different countries. The switch to less carbon-
intensive fuels also has continued, so that CO, decreases have
occurred in some industries during this period. The wood and
paper industries in industrialized countries have reduced fossil
fuel carbon emissions dramatically by using waste biomass in
efficient cogeneration systems. In newly industtializing
economies, efficiency gains have been slower because of a lack
of economic resources and access to newer technologies. Some
industrial processes are beginning to approach thermodynamic
energy-efficiency limits; future gains will have to come from
materials substitution, process changes, energy supply shifts,
and alternative resource and industrial strategies.

Industrial sources contribute to greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions in two major ways—fossil fuel
combustion for energy and process-related emissions.
The industrial sector is responsible for more than one-
third of global carbon dioxide (CO,) emissions
through energy use. Based on current energy-use pat-
terns, global energy use is expected to rise 75% by the
year 2025, with an increasing portion of growth
expected to occur in developing countries.

Several technologies, processes, and new product

design concepts exist that could substantially reduce

GHG emissions:

~- For industrialized countries, reducing the materi-
al content of products, improving energy effi-
ciency, and using fuels with a lower carbon con-
tent are essential to lower CO, emissions from
the industrial sector.

- For the reindustrializing, transitional countries of
eastern and central Europe, as well as the world’s
developing countries, seizing the opportunity to
shift to more advanced technologies will place
these countries on a much lower GHG develop-
ment trajectory.

Technology transfer from industrial to industrializing

countries and the establishment of innovative capaci-

ty building in developing countries are expected to
generate lower GHG emissions.

"Industries often have high energy-consumption levels, with
large amounts of waste heat being released to bodies of water
or the atmosphere. Heat cascading can be incorporated into a
new or existing factory if careful attention is paid to the tem-
peratures of its various industrial processes. Waste-heat recov-
ery, which usually is aimed at rationalizing specific industrial
processes, can be more effective at the level of coordinated
manufacturing and energy industrial complexes. Further
improvements could involve integrating energy-use issues into
urban infrastructure from the initial stages of city planning
with the development of support systems such as thermal-man-
agement technologies, regulations, and social mechanisms.
"	Text
"The manufacturing sector uses materials and chemicals to gen-
erate production and consumption goods, which ultimately are
discarded or recycled. Recycling can involve restoring the
material to its original use or “cascading” the material by suc-
cessively downgradihg its use into applications requiring lower
quality. Materials cascading is well-established in the paper
industry, for example, and is effective when recycling products
back into the same ones is too energy-intensive or difficult.
Generating materials from scrap tends to produce fewer GHGs
and is less expensive than the use of primary raw materials, but
there may not always be markets for downgraded materials.
Emphasis also is needed on technological innovation to
upgrade the quality of recycled products.

"Implementation problems to improve energy and material effi-
ciency in industry may involve information and training
aspects, financial and economic conditions, or legal and insti-
tutional issues. In the case of industrialized countries, effi-
ciency improvements become more difficult when world
energy prices are low. Imposition of ecotaxes to stimulate effi-
ciency in industry is a complex issue because taxes that are not
levied on a global scale may provoke industry relocation,
which may in turn have adverse effects on emissions efficien-
cy. Systems of internationally traded emission permits and
opportunities for joint implementation are other alternatives
that require careful consideration, given their economic and
political implications.
"	Text
"In developing countries, raising efficiency levels involves
complex factors such as the higher capital and foreign-
exchange requirements usually associated with more-efficient
processes. Moreover, the scale of operations, the scarcity of
management resources, and the age composition of equipment
creates additional difficulties that are not easily overcome from
a purely energy-oriented point of view. Although technology
transfer programs could potentially assist in the early adoption
of efficient equipment, there is no reason to be more optimistic
about their success in the case of energy technology than in the
case of other technologies. In all countries, the tendency to
look exclusively at short-term financial and economic factors
to determine efficiency improvement potential overlooks insti-
tutional and organizational issues that are equally important in
realizing those potentials. This is particularly true of improve-
ments in materials efficiency, where institutional arrangements
for collecting and recycling materials are crucial for a proper
functioning of markets.

goods and services can be met without adversely altering the

"The major contribution of greenhouse gases by the industrial sec-
tor is from carbon dioxide (CO,) released by the burning of fossil
fuels for energy. In addition, the industrial sector is responsible for
significant releases of process-related greenhouse gases, including
CO,, methane (CH,), nitrous oxide (N,O), and other industrial
gases, of which the most prominent are halocarbons and hydro-
halocarbons. Sulfur oxide emissions associated with energy use
and from the smelting of sulfide ores appear to be responsible for
some cooling as well as for regional environmental damage.

"The energy sector as a whole is thought to contribute about
57% of global warming (IPCC, 1990). Energy use in the indus-
trial sector varies vastly among different countries. An exami-
nation of data sets that attempt to disaggregate the energy use
of particular economies reveals that the structure of economies
and the availability of particular energy sources play major
roles in the contribution of greenhouse gases by the industrial
sector. A summary of energy-related CO, releases for the
industrial sectors of the 15 largest CO,-emitting countries is
presented in Table 20-1 (di Primio, 1993).

"Worldwide future trends of industrial energy have been project-
ed by inputting data from the Energy Modeling Forum report
(EMF, 1994) into the Asian Pacific Integrated Model (AIM)
(Morita et al., 1994; Matsuoka et al., 1994). These projections
indicate that worldwide industrial energy use could rise from
about 107 EJ/yr in 1990 to 140 and 190 EJ/yr in 2025 and 2100,
respectively, if emissions are stabilized. These figures would
increase to yearly consumption of 242 EJ in 2025 and 500 EJ in
2100 if based on an accelerated-technology scenario (EMF,
1994), where it is assumed that 400 EJ/yr of low-cost biomass
becomes available in 2020; 20% of this resource is available at
$1.40/EJ and the remaining 80% at $2.40/EJ.

nologies and industrial processes that can be adopted by industri-
al societies—which now produce the majority of greenhouse

where emissions are increasing as efforts are made to improve the
standard of living and material well-being of citizens. Technology
transfer from industrial countries to industrializing nations and the
establishment of innovative capacity-building in developing coun-
tries in accordance with the principles of Agenda 21 (UN

"Technological mitigation options for greenhouse gases are increas-
ingly being sought so that societies can continue meeting human
needs without jeopardizing the global climate system. This effort
must be part of a comprehensive reexamination of industrial activ-
ity to address a full range of environmental and economic issues in
the context of industrial ecology (i.e., meeting development goals
within local and global sustainability capacities). Industrial ecolo-
gy approaches attempt to emulate natural systems by utilizing
waste from one industrial process as feedstock for another; effi-
ciently utilizing “waste heat”; designing industrial processes to
minimize energy and materials use; and replacing hazardous sub-
stances with more environmentally benign substitutes. Several
recent works describe the industrial ecology approach and cite
examples of recent attempts to implement it (Socolow et al., 1994;
Ayres and Simonis, 1994; Allenby and Richards, 1994).

"Because countries differ significantly in their methods for
recording and maintaining energy and economic data, precise
comparisons are not always possible. The industrial use of
energy for manufacturing, mining, construction, and feed-
stocks in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) countries has fluctuated around 40 EJ
since 1970 and typically is only 25-30% of total energy use.
Developing countries are estimated to have raised their indus-
trial energy use to 30 EJ by 1988 (35-45% of total energy); the
transitional Eastern and Central European economies peaked at
around 28 EJ of industrial energy in 1988, but experienced esti-
mated declines of as much as 12% in the next 3 years. The
industrial fraction of energy use by the Soviet Union was
approximately 40% and that of China 60% in 1988 (Schipper
and Meyers, 1992). In part, this variation reflects not only dif-
ferences in energy intensity but also the more-rapid growth of
the industrial sectors of developing countries, the restructuring
of OECD economies from manufacturing to service, improved
energy efficiency in manufacturing, and the transfer of some
energy-intensive industries to developing countries. Within
this context, attention should be paid to the potential danger of
transferring greenhouse gas-intensive, ecologically damaging
processes and production of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) to
transitional and developing countries.

some cases—such as the production of cement, lime, and
iron—the release of greenhouse gases is intrinsic to the product,
so the only option for GHG reductions is material substitution.

"Schipper and Myers (1992) examined the energy/economic
value ratio for a variety of industrial sectors for the United
States, Japan, and six European countries. All major industrial
sectors recorded gains in measured energy efficiency between
1971 and 1988. For this group of eight nations, energy intensi-
ty for chemicals declined by 37%, pulp and paper by 27%,
building materials by 32%, ferrous metals by 27%, and nonfer-
rous metals by 26%. Surprisingly, less energy-intensive sectors
also declined by an average of 37% during the same period.
Ferrous metals and pulp and paper require the greatest energy
per value added, followed by nonferrous metals, building mate-
tials, and chemicals. The major source of these gains was iden-
tified as a combination of 1) better housekeeping practices in
operation and maintenance, 2) higher cost investments in
process equipment, and 3) replacement of older, less efficient
technology with new production processes. In some subsectors
such as chemicals, there is also some shift to less energy-inten-
sive products. An excellent case study of how multimillion dol-
lar energy efficiency gains have been achieved in the American
chemical industry has been given by Nelson (1994).

"For transitional economies, the rate of economic activity is
likely to be more fluctuating than for OECD countries. In the
short run, a further decrease in aggregate industrial energy
demand can be expected because of the ongoing, dramatic
restructuring of the industrial sector—which may affect the
energy-inefficient heavy industries in particular. Although
some Eastern European countries already are recovering from
earlier transition difficulties, this is not yet the case for the for-
mer Soviet Union, where further declines are expected
(Schipper and Martinot, 1993). At least for the period 1990 to
1995, a sharp drop in GHG emissions is fairly certain.
Nevertheless, in the long run, these economies may expand
again at a high rate, compensating for their earlier performance
lapses. By that time, the relatively strong role of heavy indus-
try will not continue under conditions of a market economy,
and the development of the sectoral pattern will be toward
reduced GHG emissions. Given excessively high current ener-

"Whereas many studies analyze industrial energy demand
developments in OECD countries, the historical evidence
regarding transitional economies is much scarcer. Data avail-
ability and compatibility problems abound. In transitional
economies, industry has been very dominant, accounting for
approximately half of total energy use. Through the late 1980s,
energy demand grew at a rate of about 2% annually, with rela-
tively little progress in energy efficiency or structural change.
In the 5 years after it reached a peak in 1988, industrial energy
demand dropped sharply from central planning levels,
although less so than industrial output. CO, is estimated to
have dropped by a little more than 25% in the former Eastern
bloc between 1988 and 1993 (Brown et al., 1995). Thus, man-
ufacturing energy demand and related GHG emissions have
been much more directly coupled to aggregate industrial
growth and decline (volume effects) and much less affected by
structural and efficiency effects than has been the case in
OECD industrialized nations. The trend for transitional
economies with respect to GHG emissions had been strongly
upward until 1989; at that time, a clear break occurred, and the
trend has been sharply downward to the present.

"Industrial energy use in developing countries is dominated by
China, India, and Brazil. Until 1980, China followed national
policies focusing on heavy industry; since 1980, however, the
emphasis has shifted toward lighter industries. Industrial
growth has been very high—14% annually. At the same time,
aggregate manufacturing energy intensity declined consider-
ably—30% between 1980 and 1988 (Huang, 1993). However,
structural change accounted for only a small part of this reduc-
tion; most of the change was caused by efficiency improve-
ments in all industrial sectors. Industrial growth in India has
been slower in the same period but still impressive, at roughly
7% annually. India’s energy efficiency increased by about
25%. A larger part of this improvement probably was account-
ed for by structural changes than was the case in China. The
picture for Brazil is altogether different because the growth in
export-oriented, energy-intensive industries was very high.
From 1973 to 1988, industrial production increased by 65%
while energy intensity increased by 25%, leading to a doubling
of total energy use. Structural changes between and within
industrial sectors were the dominating force, more than com-
pensating for efficiency improvements in individual sectors
(Keller, 1991). However, part of this growth has been based on
hydroelectric developments and, because of the effects of shifts
to biomass alcohol fuel, the additions to GHG emissions are
less than energy demand growth.

Improvements have occurred in cokemaking, continuous cast-

same levels of greenhouse gases even when they have
achieved the same average levels of affluence. An examina-

economic development paths they have followed in getting to
their present economic and industrial stage of development
can provide useful insights into which policies and strategies
may be most effective for producing lower-GHG industrial
societies. Figure 20-1 illustrates fossil fuel development
paths over the past 30 years for the United States, the 15
nations that now comprise the European Union (less East
Germany), Japan, China, India, and the former Soviet Union
(Moomaw and Tullis, 1995). These countries accounted for
just over 80% of global CO, emissions in 1990. Both total
and industrial-sector CO, emissions are correlated with
national GDP, which is expressed as purchasing power parity
in 1985 U.S, dollars (Summers and Heston, 1991, 1994). The
industrial-sector carbon dioxide data consist of industrial-
sector emissions plus refinery emissions and the industrial
electricity fraction of each nation’s electric power-sector
emissions (OECD, 1994). It is clear that different nations
have followed very different fossil-fuel trajectories to arrive
at their present economic status (Moomaw and Tullis, 1994).
The decline in CQ, in the former Soviet Union is tied to the
decrease in industrial output. Whereas total and industrial-
sector CO, emissions continue to rise for expanding industri-
alizing economies like those of China and India, they have
nearly leveled off or decreased for industrial nations. | It is
important to note that the industrial-sector and total CO,
emission levels of most OECD countries are below their his-
toric peaks even though their economies and populations
have continued to expand.

the adoption of electric-arc furnaces and the efficient evolu-

Problems from contamination by impurities may limit this

advantage of using more plastics in transportation and in

intensive. Recycling polymers is advantageous from an
energy perspective but is difficult because their low den-

the waste stream make them difficult to reprocess.
Moreover, innovation in plastics is important and makes
standardization difficult. Some standardization on a
smaller number of resins or other policy options might

United States, chemicals accounted for 60.3 Mt or 19.6% of
industrial-energy CO, in 1985, right behind the primary-
metals sector. This sector also accounted for most of the
39.4 Mt of nonfossil-fuel carbon released by the industrial
sector (Marland and Pippin, 1990). Since the oil shocks of
the 1970s, the chemical industry has redesigned processes,
significantly reducing energy use and lowering the produc-

chemical industry reports a decrease of 47% in energy per
ton of product from 1976 to 1988 though little change dur-

"CO, is emitted during cement production in two ways.
Approximately 0.75 t of CO, is produced per ton of cement
from combustion of fossil fuels to operate the rotary kiln. The
second source is calcination, in which calcium carbonate
(CaCO;) from limestone, chalk, or other calcium-rich materi-
als is heated in kilns to form lime (CaO) by driving off CO).
This process produces about 0.5 t of CO, per ton of cement.
Thus, combining these two sources, for every ton of cement
produced, 1.25 t of CO, is released into the atmosphere—of
which 60% comes from energy inputs and 40% from calcina-
tion (Griffin, 1987). Worldwide, cement production accounted
for approximately 162 Mt of C emissions in 1991, or about
2.6% of total global carbon from oxidation of fossil fuels. The
United States annually produces about 9.3 Mt C from cement
production, or 6% of global cement-production carbon
(CDIAC, 1993).

CO,, they can provide long-term sequestration of carbon in
durable products. The major fossil-fuel inputs for paper produc-

comply with clean-air and water requirements in several coun-
tries, the paper industry developed efficient cogeneration sys-

burning liquors, bark, and other wood waste. The U.S. paper

Japan improved the energy efficiency of its pulp and paper

when dry, it releases 19,424 kJ/kg (comparable to lignite)

"Cascaded energy use involves fully harnessing the heat pro-
duced by fossil-fuel combustion, from its initial 1,800°C down
to near-ambient temperatures, with a thermal “down flow” of
heat analogous to the downward flow of water in a cascade. If
a water flow were to be used to generate electricity, for exam-
ple, a dam would first be built on a mountain; then a succession
of power-generation plants would be set at strategic points
down the river to use up heads of water. Once the river water
had flowed to sea level, it would have become useless for elec-
tricity generation. The heads of water at each generation plant
are analogous to temperature gradients in thermal energy; sea
level corresponds to ambient temperature. As in the case of river
water reaching sea level, heat that has cooled to ambient tem-
perature no longer is usable. Currently, even in the industrial
sector, there are extremely few cases of heat being used in mul-
tiple stages (cascaded) akin to hydroelectric power generation.

heat from electric power-producing gas turbines to boost the
lower-temperature heat from municipal waste incineration to

(Lindemann, 1992; NEDO, 1993). Industrial centers based on

"When goods are made of materials whose manufacture con-
sumes considerable amounts of energy, the recycling and reuse
of those goods can save not only energy but GHGs released to
the atmosphere. However, recycling usually involves complex
tradeoffs. For example, a car with an aluminum frame is lighter
than a car with a steel frame—and thus consumes less energy
for the same transportation service—but its own energy con-
tent is higher because the energy content of aluminum is high-
er than that of steel. Using returnable glass bottles instead of
plastic bottles for mineral water (i.e., artifacts with a much
longer lifetime—the average returnable glass bottle being used
18 times, for example, in Europe) reduces the amount of ener-
gy embodied in the materials needed for the same service but
increases the energy embodied in collecting, transporting, and
washing the bottles. Moreover, lengthening the lifetimes of
durable goods may hinder the diffusion of new generations of
goods or techniques that emit less CO,. Assessing the emis-
sions benefits of such actions, therefore, requires careful life-
cycle analysis.

mated to be 30% at the world level, which also is the rate esti-
mated for the present recycling of glass bottles in OECD coun-
tries (IIASA, 1993). Reliable rates for plastics are difficult to
arrive at, though they seem to be increasing. Recycling data for
developing countries are scarce. In some developing countries,
such as India, recycling is significant—a great proportion
being carried out by the “informal sector” (Konishi, 1995).

"The use of plants as a source of chemical feedstock also can
reduce CO, emissions. Many large wood-products companies
already produce chemicals in association with their primary
timber or paper production. In India, a major effort to develop
a “phytochemical” feedstock base has been underway at the
National Environmental Engineering Research Institute. The
production of chemicals such as acetone, butandiol, butanol,
and isopropanol utilizing water hyacinth, grass, and industrial
waste as feedstocks has been demonstrated to be technically
feasible. The same institution also has been working to devel-
op processes to improve the production of CH,, as well as
microbial conversion of CH, to methanol (Motwani et al.,
1993; Juwarkar et al., 1994; Sharma et al., 1994).

"Differences in recycling rates among countries yield a first
approach to the existing potential. In Japan, for example, rates
for paper and glass bottles were expected to reach 55% by
1994 and rates for steel and aluminum cans to reach 60% in
1995. In Europe, voluntary agreements between administra-
tions and business organizations have been signed to reach
recycle rates of 60 to 70% for packaging materials and about
75% of the material content of automobiles before the end of
the century. All of these figures are well above world averages.
Public measures to improve recycling of materials also must
strike the right balance among collection, sorting, and reusing
activities. This balance is rather unstable at present and has led
in extreme cases to a collapse of secondary-materials markets,
thus frustrating further developments.

"A number of possibilities for reducing industrial greenhouse
gases arise from the management of materials rather than of
energy. Dematerialization (decreasing the amount of a mater-
ial or substituting lighter-weight material for it) can play a
major role in lowering GHG emissions (Grubler et al., 1993;
Herman et al., 1989). Energy-related CO, also can be reduced
in manufacturing by substituting less energy-intensive materi-
als for more energy-intensive materials. Materials that release
significant quantities of process GHGs during production can
be replaced with materials that release fewer process GHGs
(e.g., replacing aluminum with plastic lowers carbon and fluo-
rocarbon emissions). Developing fundamentally new process-
es that use intrinsically less energy or are dependent on com-
pletely different feedstocks such as dry process for paper mak-
ing, also can lower CO, releases.

have a relatively short lifetime—on the order of a decade or, at
the most, 20 years. Hence, there is plenty of opportunity to
introduce low-GHG-emitting technology into the manufactur-
ing process as part of normal capital-stock turnover.
Unfortunately, under present circumstances, there are no com-
pelling incentives for companies to choose a lower-GHG-emis-

processes or products. Hence, there is a need for additional
policy instruments and incentives, some of which are described

"Even when efficiency improvements and greenhouse gas
reductions are feasible from a technical perspective, there
remain a number of barriers that still may prevent the realiza-

the opportunities that are available. Second, there may be cap-
ital constraints such as unfavorable pricing of energy or recy-
cled materials. Third, institutional and legal measures may be
necessary where financial and economic incentives remain
weak and markets for efficient equipment are just emerging. In
some cases, additional research may be needed to develop
appropriate energy-efficient technologies, material-efficient
applications, or nonpolluting manufacturing processes. Table

"Because future global industrial growth will take place largely
in the developing and transitional economies, the early transfer
of advanced energy-conservation technology may be crucial to
curb worldwide GHG emissions. Developing countries might
even jump from an early stage of industrial -development to an
advanced stage in one step. Such leapfrogging makes sense
only if the new technology is economically superior to the old
technology over its life cycle and if capital is available to pur-
chase it. This may be the case only for isolated, large-scale,
turn-key projects that usually are associated with multination-
al corporations or multinational lending agencies. The applica-
bility of the concept across the spectrum of efficiency options
needs careful scrutiny. In many cases, judicious adaptations
may be called for, particularly to enable the manufacturing of
major components by local industries.

greenhouse effect results from a huge number of interrelated
decisions made by economic actors (e.g., business firms and

icy tools. However, although some assessments have been car-
ried out on the effect of a carbon tax on energy efficiency in
different sectors, little work has been done on the effect of such
a tax on recycling or material substitutions. We must therefore
admit that we do not know the efficiency of economic instru-

"Implementation problems for energy-efficiency improvements
in developing and transitional economies are more severe than
those in industrial countries. In addition to problem areas
already indicated, key problems in both developing and transi-

foreign exchange, and industrial energy prices and tariffs that
often are below those of the world market. Because energy-
saving investments often are characterized by capital and for-
eign-exchange intensity rather than by labor and resource
intensity, their cost-effectiveness tends to be less in those coun-
tries than in the industrialized countries. Moreover, develop-
ing and transitional economies, in general, are characterized by
lower overall productivity, including energy productivity. One
should not attempt to solve energy-efficiency problems in iso-
lation from other efficiency problems. Problems related to vin-
tage equipment, scarcity of management skills, small-scale

devote more attention to research, development, and demonstra-

"As another example, an ongoing regulatory process within the
European Community is aimed at drastically reducing the vol-

wastes. Waste “processing” may be recycling and/or incinera-
tion with heat recovery and/or power generation—the former
being preferred, although it is not clear that clean incineration
is always worse for the environment than recycling. For indus-
try, the cost of producing wastes will therefore rise, leading to
“material-efficiency” improvements (including internal recy-

"Regulations banning dangerous dissipative uses have been
implemented in many OECD countries, particularly for heavy

pressure on recyclability, mostly driven by solid-waste con-
cerns. This trend is illustrated by recent French and German
initiatives concerning packaging wastes. The producers of
packaging materials have been made responsible, through vol-

"Internalizing environmental costs in energy prices and tariffs
through ecotaxes is particularly problematic for the industrial
sector because of the consequences for national competitive-
ness on international markets. Taxes that are not levied on a
global scale may provoke industry relocation, which may
adversely affect emissions efficiency as well as international
competitiveness. Most countries are hesitant to embark on pol-
icy ventures that might endanger their international market
position and their attractiveness as industrial locations.
Although tax exemptions for specific industries are possible,
policymakers are wary about the administrative feasibility and
costs of such exemptions. On the other hand, little empirical
evidence points to any actual dangers of industrial relocation
resulting from ecotax burdens. Because only new investment is
affected, the impact of taxation may not be immediately appar-
ent, although the impact may be more pronounced in the future
because industries are becoming more international.

"Opportunities for efficiency improvement through system
integration are substantial in densely populated areas of the
industrial world, where sources of waste heat and materials
and demands for low-temperature heat and waste materials
as inputs often are located close together. Such opportuni-
ties, however, pose additional implementation barriers
because the organizational and regulatory complexities of
system-integration projects are particularly demanding. A
positive attitude from local-authorities and utility planners
and an innovative approach in regional planning have proved
essential in the few cases in which this approach has been
successfully followed.

"Seeing is believing. Often, the amount of uncertainty associ-
ated with a new technology being applied to a new situation
with untested goals and techniques is too great to convince
managers to invest in it—even if theory indicates not only
that the investment will be safe but also that it will return div-
idends throughout its lifetime. However, if those same man-
agers see the technology successfully applied to a test bed
under conditions’ that resemble their company’s situation,
they might be more convinced that it would work for them,
Such demonstrations can be offered by government agencies,
trade groups, developers of the technology, utilities, corpora-

"Broad voluntary agreements have been fashioned between
industry and government to curb energy demand. Such vol-
untary agreements free governments from the regulatory bur-
den of setting up complicated and inefficient systems of
industrial-equipment efficiency standards and operating
norms, and enable industries to choose strategies and tech-
nologies that are most efficient from the point of view of
industry-specific conditions and opportunities. However, the
effectiveness of such arrangements clearly depends on the
financial conditions facing the industry. When profit posi-
tions become less favorable, through internal or external cir-
- cumstances, the incentive to honor voluntary agreements is
likely to suffer.

"A final approach to reducing GHG emissions from the indus-
trial sector is the development and imposition of standards.
This strategy already has been used in such applications as
automotive emissions and the energy efficiency of buildings.
Such standards can be written by industry groups and incor-
porated into regulations or legislation. Such standards ensure
that feasible goals are set, that the technology to achieve
those goals is available or under development, that a level
playing field is provided for all participants, that the infor-
mation needed to comply with the standards is disseminated,
and that monitoring and enforcement mechanisms are in
place. One of the advantages of such an approach is its flex-
ibility; the standards and the technologies they prescribe can
change over time in response to technical advances, eco-
nomic conditions, and the perception of social and political
needs.

"The worldwide industrial sector contributes a large percentage
of GHGs to the atmosphere. The bulk of this is CO, associat-
ed with energy use, but significant quantities of process
GHGs—including CO,, CH,, N,O, CFCs, and other halo- and
hydrohalocarbons—also are released. OECD industrial
economies contribute the bulk of fossil fuel CO, emissions,
but these have remained relatively constant over the past 2
decades. Transitional-economies emissions have declined
sharply since 1988 with the contraction of economic output,
while developing-economies emissions have grown as their
industrial sectors have expanded. A number of opportunities
have been identified in the most energy- and GHG-intensive
industrial subsectors for more efficient use of energy and
materials. Creating industrial ecosystems that make maximal
use of recycled secondary materials as feedstocks and take
advantage of cascaded lower-temperature heat can lead to sub-
stantial reductions in greenhouse gas releases. The use of
low-carbon fuels, renewable energy technologies, less energy-
intensive materials, and dematerialization can lead to lower
GHG emissions in all economies. Shifting industrial practices
to reduce GHG emissions (and other environmental pollu-
tants) can occur as part of the regular replacement of capital
stock, but information and a variety of economic incentives
and other policies are likely to be needed to assure that
replacement technologies and processes are chosen that lower
GHG releases.

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
"	Title
"Policies with a wide variety of social, economic, and environ-
mental objectives—especially those of reducing traffic conges-
tion, accidents, noise, and local air pollution—also can reduce
greenhouse gas emissions from transport. Conversely, green-
house gas mitigation strategies are likely to be more acceptable
"	Text
"Greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced in all transport
modes through changes in vehicle energy intensity or energy
source, stimulated by research and development as well as by
changes in current patterns of intervention in the markets for
vehicles and fuels:
"	Text
"In many circumstances, strategies may not be implemented if
they might reduce the benefits provided by transport systems to
individuals and firms. Greenhouse gas mitigation strategies will
have to address this issue and find ways to meet or change the
needs and desires currently met by energy-intensive transport.
Preferences in travel behavior are driven by social and cultural
factors, as well as by cost-effectiveness in meeting needs.
"	Text
"The use of motor vehicles might be reduced by changing land-
use patterns and lifestyles to reduce the need for goods trans-
port and travel; restrictions on the use of motor vehicles; and
fiscal or other measures to discourage motor vehicle use and to
encourage the use of nonmotorized transport. No confidence
can be placed in estimates for the ultimate potential mitigation
through these measures. A few city authorities have used pack-
ages of such measures to control traffic and have reduced ener-
gy use by 20 to 40%.
"	Text
"Travel-mode switching from car to bus or rail can reduce pri-
mary energy use by 30 to 70%, while switching container
freight traffic from road to rail can reduce primary energy use
by 30%. The percentage of greenhouse gas emission reduction
is more than this value if railways are powered with electricity
from nonfossil sources. Confidence in the potential for mitiga-
tion through mode switching is low because human behavior
and choice play a central role, and these factors are poorly
understood.
"	Text
"Experts may not agree on the best approach among these
options and sometimes give conflicting advice. Nevertheless,
there is an emerging consensus that attempts to move traffic to
less energy-intensive modes depend on using well-integrated
strategies designed specifically for local situations. Measures
to encourage nonmotorized transport and public transport tend
to work only when combined with measures to reduce the dis-
tances people need to travel and discourage energy-intensive
vehicle use. Several cities in Latin America, Southeast Asia,
and Europe have succeeded in stemming the growth in car use
by such combined strategies.
"	Text
"Transport activity increases with rising economic activity, dis-
posable income, access to motorized transport, and falling real
vehicle and fuel costs. Societies are becoming increasingly
dependent on the car for routine travel, aircraft for long dis-
tance travel, and the truck for freight transport. Transport activ-
ity, the development of urban and other infrastructure,
lifestyles, and patterns of industrial production are all closely
interrelated. As well as being linked to economic development,
the transport sector imposes burdens on society, including the
effects of traffic congestion, accidents, air pollution, and noise.
Climate change is currently a relatively minor factor in deci-
sionmaking and policy in the sector, although this could
change in the future.
"	Text
"Improved vehicle energy efficiency might reduce
greenhouse gas emissions per unit of transport activi-
ty by 20 to 50% in 2025 relative to 1990 without
changes in vehicle performance and size.

If users were prepared to accept changes in vehicle
size and performance, transport energy intensity could
be reduced by 60 to 80% in 2025.

With energy-intensity reductions, the use of alterna-
tive energy sources could, in theory, almost eliminate
greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector
after 2025. A complete transition to zero greenhouse
gas emission surface transport is conceivable but
would depend on eliminating emissions throughout
the vehicle and fuel-supply chain.
"	List
"The transport sector—including passenger travel and freight
movements by road, rail, air, and water—was responsible for
about 25% of 1990 world primary energy use and 22% of CO,
emissions from fossil-fuel use. It is one of the most rapidly grow-
ing sectors. Energy use in 1990 was estimated to be 61-65 EJ.
Without new measures, this might grow to 90-140 EJ in 2025.
Confidence in this range, and in the outlook for relative contri-
butions of different countries, is low, and future transport ener-
gy use will be influenced by government policy. Nevertheless,
industrialized countries are expected to continue to contribute
the majority of transport-related greenhouse gas emissions
until 2025. After 2025, the majority of transport-related emis-
sions may be from countries that are currently developing
rapidly or that have economies in transition.

"emissions from the sector. Policymakers can address these
issues by developing mechanisms and institutions to inform and
educate transport stakeholders and involve them in the design
and implementation of mitigation strategies.
"	Text
"When considering transport-sector mitigation options in engi-
neering, economic, or planning terms, it is important to recog-
nize that there are simplifying assumptions in these three frame-
works, so each gives an incomplete picture. None incorporates
an accurate understanding of human behavior and choice,
although these are essential determinants of greenhouse gas
"	Text
"Appropriate mixes of policies will vary between cities and
countries. In small towns with relatively simple infrastruc-
ture, provision for nonmotorized transport and alternatives to
transport may be particularly important. Cities with rapidly
developing infrastructure have an opportunity to manage
transport-system development, ensuring the viability of non-
motorized and public transport modes. In countries and cities
with highly developed infrastructure and technical capability,
changes in the transport system are likely to be slower but
may hold more potential to influence vehicle technology and
energy sources.
"	Text
"There are several factors that lead to inertia in the development
of transport systems: Technologies and fuels now in the labo-
ratory can require several decades for commercialization;
transport infrastructure is developed slowly and has an influ-
ence that can last for centuries; stakeholders may be reluctant
to change their practices; and transport user behavior and
choice also may develop slowly in response to a changing
environment. Once transport systems are developed to service
the car, truck, and airplane, it is very difficult to reverse the
shift away from nonmotorized and public transport. Some
immediate actions can be taken to facilitate future mitigation
strategies; for example, new infrastructure can be designed to
allow for nonmotorized transport. Greenhouse gas mitigation
strategies could take some years, even decades, to deliver
results and will have to be implemented Jong before anticipat-
ed greenhouse gas reduction needs.

"In 1990, about 23 countries’ transport sectors are thought to have
consumed more than 0.42 EJ in final energy, excluding marine
bunkers. Figure 21-1 shows transport-fuel sales, excluding
marine bunkers, in the 20 of these countries for which detailed
data are available (IEA, 1993c, 1993d). In these countriés, road
traffic uses roughly 80% of total transport final energy consump-
tion, air traffic 13%, rail 4.4%, and inland water transport 2.6%.

"At least until 2025, CO, is likely to remain the main green-
house gas produced by the transport sector, and emissions will
depend mainly on energy use in the sector. Several scenarios of
transport energy use to 2025 have been developed; some are
shown in Figure 21-2. All of these projections are produced
based on some set of assumptions regarding the continuation of
historical relationships between transport fuel consumption
"	Text
"Many analysts have criticized the use of historical relationships
between the economy and energy use to produce projections.
Although car ownership is growing very rapidly in Europe and
Asia, Griibler and Nakicenovic (1991) suggest that it may sat-
urate at lower per capita levels than in North America. In this
case, global car energy use may not be much higher in 2010
than it was in 1985, assuming that fuel economy continues to
improve at historical rates.
"	Text
"International comparisons reveal a strong correlation between
transport energy use and GDP. (The data plotted in Figure 21-3
indicate a GDP elasticity of 0.89, with R2 = 0.93.) Nevertheless, at
a given level of GDP, energy use can vary by a factor of two. The
growth of transport with income and time is faster for middle-
income countries than for very-low-income countries (Button,
1992). Button developed a model for‘car ownership that has been
used by Orfeuil (1993) to indicate that, by 2020—assuming cur-
rent GDP growth trends continue—developing countries will have
a third of the world’s car fleet, compared with 14% today.

"The radiative-forcing effect of non-CO, emissions from air-
craft engines is very uncertain. In particular, the impact of NO,
emitted at altitudes where subsonic aircraft fly could be more
important than equivalent NO, emissions at the Earth’s surface.
The effect of aircraft NO, is uncertain: It could be of similar
magnitude or smaller than the effect of CO, from aircraft (see
Chapter 2.2, Other Trace Gases and Atmospheric Chemistry, in
the IPCC Working Group I volume). Aircraft also emit carbon
monoxide, water vapor, soot and other particles, sulfur gases,
and other trace constituents, which have the potential to cause
radiative forcing, but the impact of these emissions has not yet
been properly assessed.

"While CO, is the main greenhouse gas emitted by the transport
. sector, emissions of non-CO, greenhouse gases add to the
radiative forcing of vehicle emissions. In addition to nitrous
oxide (N,O), methane (CH,), and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs),
vehicles emit large quantities of carbon monoxide, volatile
organic compounds (VOCs), and nitrogen oxides (NO,) for
which global warming potentials (GWPs) are not currently
available (see IPCC Working Group I volume, 1995), N,O con-
tributes about 10% to the radiative forcing of tailpipe emis-
sions of gasoline cars equipped with three-way catalytic con-
verters (based on CEC, 1992; Prigent et al., 1991), Greenhouse
gas emissions during car manufacture and disposal add a fur-
ther 10 to 15% relative to tailpipe CO,, while releases of CFCs
(used mainly in air conditioning) add between 10 and 50%.

First, the variation among countries in distance traveled per day

(1) people travel to satisfy a certain number of access needs (for
work, services, etc.) that do not vary significantly as the trans-
port system changes, and (2) people operate with a time budget
and will spend roughly the same amount of time traveling dur-

All of these variables may be influenced by geographical,
social, economic, and other factors.

"There are competing influences on energy intensity. High-
income countries in North America and Scandinavia have effi-
cient technology but use it partly to provide a higher standard
of transport services; vehicles of most types, including buses
and trains, tend to be larger, heavier, and more comfortable.
Low-income countries, such as China and India, tend to have
less-efficient technology—but occupancies are relatively high,
leading to low energy intensity. Indeed, average two-wheeler
occupancy in Delhi, at 1.6 (Bose and Mackenzie, 1993;
UNESCAP, 1991), is higher than car-occupancy levels in many
industrialized countries, which can be as low as 1.2. Countries
between these two extremes where transport activity is cur-
rently increasing rapidly (including southern and eastern
European countries, Korea, and Japan) tend to have efficient
technology that is used for lower standards of transport service,
resulting in quite low energy intensities.

crude oil, and oil products make up 60 to 70% of goods move-

Analyses differ partly in the assumptions made but also in the
type of potential being considered. It is helpful to distinguish
among the technical potential (the reduction in greenhouse gas
emissions that would result from application of the best avail-

depends on a complex interaction among technology, the econ-

range required for road vehicles, they are currently inefficient
and expensive and have poor load-following characteristics.
By 2025, improved materials and precision engineering could

the engine to match the load on the drivetrain. These are dis-

medium- and upper-income countries. This technology reduces
emissions of carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons, and
NO, from gasoline cars by approximately 60 to 90% relative to
a car with a carburetor and no catalytic converter. NO emis-
sions are raised approximately fivefold but depend strongly on
the age of the catalyst and driving pattern (Ybema and Okken,
1993). The overall effect on radiative forcing of adding a cat-

year during the 1990s and 2.5% per year from 2000 to 2010.
With traffic expected to grow at 5.5% per year in the 1990s and
5% per year from 2000 to 2010, total fuel consumption could be
about 65% higher in 2010 than in 1990. Beyond 2010, fuel-
intensity improvements would have to come from the introduc-

lightweight heat exchangers to provide charge cooling and recu-

NO, emissions from aircraft engines are more complex, and
there may be some tradeoff between NO, emissions and engine
efficiency. During the past decade, manufacturers have devel-

For the latter, the potential and time scale for achieving the
anticipated 30 to 40% reduction are open to question. Research
also is underway—primarily aimed at a second generation of

Because fuel constitutes 20 to 30% of shipping costs, opera-

of new car sales, but a further expansion of the program was mothballed because of the drop in the price of oil. In the
first phase of the program, the government provided up to 75% subsidies for ethanol-producer investments and assured a
6% return on the investments. At this stage, however, car manufacturers were unwilling to produce ethanol-only vehi-

guaranteed to be no more than 65% that of gasoline. The car industry was encouraged by the government’s commitment
and started producing ethanol vehicles. Despite initially poor redesign of engines, the consumer take-up was massive.

or hydrogen as energy carriers (MacKenzie, 1994; Sperling et

make final energy use independent of the primary source of

"The New Zealand government launched a compressed natural gas (CNG) program in 1979, aiming for 150,000 post-
assembly vehicle conversions to CNG by the end of 1985. The main motivations for the program were to enhance New
Zealand’s energy security and improve its balance of payments. Incentives were provided in the form of grants and loans
for vehicle conversion and filling-station development. The cost of car conversion at the time was about NZ$1,500
(US$750 in 1984 prices); the government provided NZ$150. Initial take-up was poor, but it was improved in late 1980
by an increase in the grant to NZ$200 and increased subsidies to fueling stations, along with tax benefits to consumers.

"The vehicle conversion rate fell from 2,400/month in 1984 to 150/month by 1987. By 1993, CNG sales fell to 42% of
their peak level in 1985, contributing only 2% of road-transport fuel. In addition to the withdrawal of government subsi-
dies to CNG, a number of factors may have contributed to this demise. One is the increase in CNG prices from less than
half to about two-thirds of the gasoline price, at a time when oil markets have been quite stable. Another possible factor
is a negative public perception of CNG resulting from a number of faulty installations in the early 1980s, a cylinder
explosion in 1989, the poor performance of dual-fuel vehicles that were not optimized to operate on CNG, and the real-
ization that carrying CNG cylinders substantially reduces luggage space. A third possible factor is a lack of industry
enthusiasm for marketing the fuel, bearing in mind that most of the retail outlets are oil-company-owned filling stations.

and trolleybuses, as well as in electric trains. Urban bus and
light-rail routes involve low speeds and frequent stops. In these

avoidance of energy use when stationary, and the absence of
emissions at the point of use.

"Emissions can be eliminated at the point of vehicle operation
by the use of some form of electric drive. Power can then be
supplied by oxidation of hydrogen in a fuel cell, from an elec-

part-load, no fuel consumption when stationary, and the poten-

"Some recent studies in California (Bunch e¢ al., 1993) indicate
that, in choosing between conventional and alternative vehi-

extra cost and shorter range of battery-powered and other alter-
native-fuel vehicles. Other studies in California (Sperling,
1995) have found that consumer preferences can be modified
and that a substantial proportion of drivers might purchase
electric vehicles to use for local trips and commuting, keeping
their gasoline vehicles for other trips.

"Currently available SPFCs cost well over $1,000 per kW of
output, although some analysts predict future costs as low as
$20 per kW (Sperling, 1995). For comparison, gasoline
engines cost $20 to 40 per kW. A fuel-cell vehicle probably
would use the fuel cell to provide a constant power output, with
a battery to store power for peak-load requirements. Costs per
kilowatt for such systems would be lower than those for a fuel
cell sized for peak loads. Nevertheless, given the technical and
cost improvements required, fuel cells are unlikely to be in
widespread use for cars before 2025. They will face institu-
tional and other challenges similar to those confronting alter-
native fuels in general. However, if the various barriers to their
use can be overcome, fuel-cell cars could be the predominant
mode of motorized travel by 2050.

"Electric-car technology has been intensively developed in sev-
eral countries in recent years, mainly as a result of legislation
in California. Batteries have so far provided the best combina-
tion of energy and power density, along with low cost for on-
vehicle electricity storage. Battery-powered cars, buses, and
light vans are in use, but they have high costs and poor perfor-
mance compared with gasoline vehicles, and most types of bat-
tery would need replacing several times in the life of a vehicle.
The future evolution of this technology and of the market for
electric vehicles is very uncertain, depending on factors such as
the extent of cost reductions that can be achieved in batteries,
electric motors, and control systems; the extent to which bat-
tery-recharging rates, energy densities, and power densities can
be improved; and market factors, including consumer prefer-

"Many hybrid concepts have been suggested and demonstrat-
ed, combining the advantages of electric drives and internal-
combustion engines. One approach involves using a low-
powered fuel-burning engine to run a generator that provides a
constant supply of electric power (see, e.g., Lovins et al.,
1993). This is either used directly to power electric motors or
fed to a peaking storage device, which might be a battery or
flywheel. A major theoretical advantage of such a system is
that the engine can operate under its optimum speed and load,
and braking energy can, in principle, be recovered and stored.
In principle, energy savings in urban driving could amount to
40 to 60%. However, with current technology, energy savings
are likely to be very small because efficiency is constrained by
energy losses in the electric generator, storage device, and
motor; matching the engine and electrical storage device to real
on-road power requirements is difficult; and existing batteries
are unable to recharge at the rates required to store a useful por-
tion of energy from the engine and from braking. Flywheels
may be more appropriate for this purpose, and the concept is
under development. Hybrid technology is not likely to achieve
substantial market share in the short term without government
intervention, in view of the high overall cost of an electric
motor, control system, and battery or other storage device. It
might be feasible to produce hybrid vehicles on a competitive
commercial basis some time between 2005 and 2025.

example of a technology-forcing intervention is the California
Air Resources Board’s strategy for encouraging the develop-

strategy of announcing a timetable for gradually tightening
standards or increasing fiscal incentives, aimed at reducing
greenhouse gas emissions, will encourage industry both to

"An alternative to the high-speed train is “maglev”: trains that
are levitated on a magnetic field rather than having wheels in
direct contact with tracks. The only existing maglev systems in
use are small-scale local shuttle or transit systems. Maglev
trains may have some energy-efficiency advantage compared
with wheeled trains at a given speed, but analyses differ on this
(Schafer et al., 1992), Rolling resistance (25% of energy use in
a normal high-speed train) is avoided, but energy is required to
power the magnets. The main advantage of maglev trains is
that they can operate at higher speeds than wheeled trains; the
Transrapid line to be built from Hamburg to Berlin will oper-
ate at up to 450 km/h. This means that they can compete with
air travel over longer distances than existing high-speed
trains—potentially as far as 1,500 km. Maglev trains have the
disadvantage compared with high-speed trains that, unless pro-
vided with auxiliary wheels, they cannot use existing stretches

"A UK study in the 1970s found that the degree of hilliness and
perceived safety were the main determinants of the share of
trips by bicycle in a number of towns (Rowell and Fergusson,
1991, quoting Waldman, 1977). While it is hard to modify
hills, safety and security are important keys to maintaining and
promoting levels of cycling and walking. Safety for cyclists
can be improved by providing physically separated cycle lanes
on and off roads and by giving cyclists priority over motorized
traffic at junctions. Security against cycle theft can be
improved by providing appropriate parking facilities. Safety
for pedestrians can be improved by providing and maintaining
footpaths, providing lighting at night, and ensuring safe means
of crossing roads. For rickshaws and carts, similar facilities are
effective—in particular separated lanes on roads so they do not
have to compete for and disrupt traffic.

"Engineers often emphasize the operational efficiency
of transport systems and usually offer solutions based
on technology or the design of infrastructure.
Economists usually emphasize economic efficiency,
aiming to maximize the benefits minus the costs of
the transport system. Their solutions tend to focus on
improving the functioning of the market.

Other social scientists, such as sociologists, political
scientists, anthropologists, and development planners,
are less likely than engineers or economists to use for-
malized concepts of optimization. Their solutions are
likely to focus on institutions, community involve-
ment, and consultation.

Physical planners (architects, city planners, and trans-
port planners) tend to view transport issues as part of
a wider picture of urban development. Their solutions
tend to relate to the spatial organization and design of

"Encouraging public-transport use and nonmotorized modes.
Travel by bus, train, foot, or bicycle usually involves lower
greenhouse gas emissions per km than travel by car (see Section
21.2.5) and also can reduce wider social and environmental
damage. People’s willingness to use low-energy-intensity trans-
port modes depends partly on the quality of travel by those
modes. Planners can influence this by providing infrastructure,
such as pedestrian and cycle paths, bus lanes, and railways.
Public-transport use can be increased by providing better infor-
mation about services, reducing fares, and improving the quali-
ty of the service. Flexible services, such as shared taxis and
“dial-a-ride” minibuses, can play a role. Improvements in pub-
lic transport rarely have proved to be an effective means of
stemming the rise in private-transport use unless combined with
measures to limit the attraction of car travel, such as access and
parking constraints. Experience in Hannover, Zurich, and other
cities indicates that such combined approaches can be success-
ful (Brég, 1993; Goodwin, 1985, Ott, 1993). Lessons learned in
these cities may have particular relevance for cities in Central
and Eastern Europe (Suchorzewski, 1993).

"In the short term, the greatest potential for urban planning to
affect transport energy use is in rapidly developing cities where
the car is still a minority transport mode. In such cities, infra-

decline in use of less energy-intensive modes. Provision for

pleased with the results (Ott, 1993), The best schemes have
resulted in increased safety, a more pleasant street environment,
and improved retail trade (Hass-Klau, 1990, 1993). Poorly
designed schemes can make emissions worse (for example, speed
bumps that are too far apart encourage acceleration and deceler-
ation), but in general these policies are seen as reinforcing the
attractiveness of public transport and deterring traffic growth.
The effectiveness of a strategy may hinge on consultation with
the local community on its preferred approaches. Flexibility also
can be an essential component: Counterproductive effects cannot
always be anticipated, and it is important to monitor the results of
measures to identify necessary changes.

"Urban structure affects the distance people travel to meet their
needs. Travel patterns may be influenced by many factors,
including the size of settlements, proximity to other settle-
ments, location of workplaces, provision of local facilities, and
car ownership. Changes to settlement planning and regulation
have been proposed as means of reducing car use and encour-
aging public transport and nonmotorized travel (Newman and
Kenworthy, 1989). However, the link between settlement pat-
terns and energy use for transport is controversial, and analysts
have produced conflicting recommendations (Banister, 1992).
While there does appear to be an inverse correlation between
urban density and transport energy use (Armstrong, 1993),
experts disagree on the desirability and effectiveness of densi-
fying existing dispersed populations to reduce energy use. The
trend toward lower urban density may result from people pur-
chasing homes in locations with lower land prices where they
have an improved quality of life. Attempts to reverse this trend
may depend on addressing the welfare implications directly
through measures to improve the physical and social environ-
ment in high-density areas. Policies that directly discourage the
use of energy-intensive transport modes are likely to be more
effective in reducing energy use.

"In theory, the most economically efficient way of reducing car fuel consumption is through fiscal measures (which are
discussed in Section 21.4.5). Higher fuel taxes tend to lead drivers to economize through driving more carefully, reducing
the distance they drive, and choosing more energy-efficient vehicles. However, fuel taxes are difficult to impose in some
countries. Consumers often have inadequate information about the cars they are buying and may not respond optimally to
the price change. More complex price-based measures, such as taxes (or subsidies) linked to vehicle fuel economy, may
be more effective in the long term, because they give consumers a direct incentive at the time of purchase to choose an
energy-efficient vehicle.
"	Text
"An alternative or complement to taxation is to use regulations to require car manufacturers to sell more energy-efficient
cars, There are advantages and disadvantages to this approach. Standards avoid the large transfer payments that might be
required with a tax approach, given the low price elasticity of transport-fuel demand. On the other hand, improving fuel
economy can lead to reduced driving costs and increased travel (the “rebound effect”), so that, while energy use and
greenhouse gas emissions may be reduced overall, other environmental and social impacts of transport may be increased.
Vehicle standards are sometimes criticized because they provide industry with insufficient flexibility to find the best tech-
nical solutions to complex problems. In the U.S. Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (CAFE) program, this problem is
partly addressed by allowing manufacturers freedom to determine the fuel economy of individual models, provided that
the average fuel economy of their total sales of cars meets the standard. Companies that do not meet the required average
fuel economy have to pay fines. Meanwhile, very-high-consuming cars are subject to a “gas guzzler tax,” which is effec-
tive in limiting the fuel economy of cars sold (DeCicco and Gordon, 1995). A “sipper rebate” for very-low-consuming
cars has been discussed, though never enacted. Manufacturers of alternative-fuel vehicles can claim credits against their
corporate-fuel-economy average, allowing them to produce cars with higher fuel intensity.

"A 10% increase in fuel prices results in a 1 to 6%
short-term reduction in demand, according to most
studies (Dahl and Sterner, 1991; Fowkes et al., 1993a;
Tanja et al., 1992), although the effect of price
increases is not symmetrical with the effect of price
decreases (Dargay, 1993). In the long term, fuel-price
increases encourage the use of more energy-efficient
vehicles, and a 10% increase in gasoline prices can
lead to a 5 to 16% reduction in demand. The response
to fuel price falls as incomes rise, all else being equal
(Goodwin, 1992; Greening et al., 1994). Where sev-
eral fuels compete and can be used in the same vehi-
cles, small relative price changes can have a large
effect on fuel choice (Greene, 1989; IEA, 1993a).

A 10% increase in car price leads to a 1 to 5% reduc-

there is a complex interaction between the price of
fuel, the prices of new and second-hand cars of dif-

LPG, CNG, and alcohols. Taxes are usually higher on gasoline
than on diesel, a cross-subsidy from car users to truck opera-

The implications for CO, emissions are not clear: Diesel cars
on average have lower CO, emissions per km than gasoline
cars, but since the fuel is cheap, their owners will tend to drive
their cars farther than do gasoline car owners. On the other
hand, if gasoline taxes are higher than they otherwise would

are opportunities to learn and can be dealt with, provided suf-

therefore, is to plan responsiveness into the decisionmaking
process by continuing data collection and analysis to monitor
the effects of measures and to allow decisionmakers to make

"Evaluation of options would ideally involve a cost-benefit
analysis, taking account of all of the social benefits and costs of
each measure. While social accounting might become a viable
and valuable tool at some time in the future, such techniques are
not currently available, and some analysts doubt whether they
ever will be—or should be—developed. In the absence of a sin-

use of multidisciplinary teams to identify costs and benefits of
the various measures and to provide a qualitative evaluation.

"Greenhouse gas emission reduction in the transport sector,
more than in any other sector, depends on obtaining coopera-
tion among the various stakeholders or interest groups who are
able to take action or who might be affected by policies.
Almost all members of society and all organizations have some
involvement in the transport system. There are numerous over-
laps between transport policy and other areas of government
policy. Inevitably, there will be some clashes of interest, but
there also will be areas of agreement. Where government
departments and other institutions, organizations, and interest
groups can agree on economic, environmental, and social aims,
there will be more scope for a coordinated approach to trans-
port policy. Coordination among regions is also important.

"Consulting stakeholders. In addition to the importance of
stakeholder consultation to obtain information about their
needs and activities, measures in the transport sector are more
likely to be effective if the people who will be influenced by
the outcome are involved in the decision-making process. It is
important for stakeholders to be given access to information in
the development of transport policy and to be allowed to com-
ment on and possibly correct it as the understanding of the sys-
tem is developed. In many countries, some form of public con-
sultation is a statutory requirement in the planning process.
Consultation can be one of the most valuable steps in deci-
sionmaking more generally, as it may generate new ideas, can
help to select the most satisfactory outcomes, and can help to
give the eventual users of the system a sense of ownership.

"Because there has been considerable experience with these

even after many years of improved energy efficiency, improve-

Commercial buildings contributed an additional 10%

Industrial (primarily OECD) countries produced 63%
of global CO, emissions in 1990; 19% came from the
former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and 18%
from the developing world.

Overall growth in emissions of CO, from buildings was
slightly over 1% per year from 1973 to 1990. Almost all
of this growth took place in the developing world and in
the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.

"The potential for the greatest growth in CO, emissions—in
both percentage and absolute terms—is in the developing
world, where per capita energy consumption in human settle-
ments is very low. Even in the industrialized countries, how-
ever, if policies to minimize such emissions are not enacted
and rigorously carried out, the already high levels of CO, emis-
sions can increase. The most significant factors influencing the
growth of GHG emissions in human settlements are likely to
be efficiency of energy use, carbon intensity of fuels used
directly in human settlements or to produce electricity, popula-
tion growth, the nature of development in the developing
world, the nature and rate of global economic growth, and
implementation of policies that are directed toward fulfilling
national commitments to reducing GHG emissions.

"Many cost-effective technologies are available to reduce ener-
gy consumption and hence CO, emissions. Some examples
include more efficient space-conditioning systems; improved
insulation and reduced air leakage in windows, walls, and
roofs—leading to reduced heat losses; and more efficient light-
ing and appliances (refrigerators, water heaters, cook stoves,
etc.). In addition, measures to counter trends toward higher
ambient temperatures in urban areas through increased vegeta-
tion and greater reflectivity of roofing and siding materials can
yield significant reductions in space-cooling energy require-
ments in warm climates. Finally, technologies for capturing
methane gases and converting them to useful purposes exist
and are cost-effective in many applications. Other technolo-
gies that can reduce or prevent the formation of methane (e.g.,
in landfills) are also increasingly available.

options for reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases
(GHGs) in human settlements. The largest portion of GHG
emissions in human settlements is in the form of carbon diox-
ide (CO,) from energy use in buildings (including emissions
from power plants that produce electricity for buildings),
amounting to about 1.7 billion tons of carbon. The other three
major sources of GHG emissions are methane from urban solid
waste (equivalent to 135-275 million tons of carbon in the
form of CO,), methane from domestic and industrial waste-
water (200-275 million tons of carbon equivalent), and a vari-
ety of GHGs produced through the combustion of biomass in
cookstoves throughout the developing world (estimated to be
100 million tons of carbon equivalent). This chapter does not

"Aggressive energy-efficiency scenarios for buildings show
reductions in overall energy demand growth of 0.5 to 1.0% per
year. Over 35 years (1990 to 2025), a 2% annual growth rate
leads to a doubling of energy use; 1.5% per year leads to a 68%
increase; and 1% per year leads to a 42% increase. Thus, ener-
gy efficiency alone could contribute about half of the reduc-
tions needed to maintain 1990 levels of CO, emissions. Such
energy efficiency scenarios, however, will require strong and
significant policy measures, well beyond what has been adopt-

order to convert this into tons of carbon equivalent, the GWP is
multiplied by the ratio of the atomic weight of carbon to the mole-
cular weight of CO,. Thus, to convert tons of methane to tons of
atmospheric carbon equivalent, we multiply tons of methane by
24.5 x 12/44 = 6.7.

commercial sector of the industrial countries and for both the
residential and commercial sectors of the FSU/EE and the devel-
oping countries is less well known. Space heating dominates
energy use in both the residential and commercial sectors of the
FSU/EE, with an estimated share of around 75% (Cooper and
Schipper, 1991). In the developing countries, space heating
accounts for only about 20% of total CO, emissions, with virtu-
ally all of that originating in China (Liu, 1993). Emissions asso-

"Regardless of the method of harvest, burning of biofuels (and bio-
mass in general) results in net emissions of methane (CH,), carbon
monoxide (CO), nitrous oxide (N,O), and nitrogen oxides (NO,) in
additicn to CO,. Of these, methane (CH,) is the most significant
because of its larger global warming potential (GWP)—which is
24.5 times that of CO,—and the large volume of emission com-
pared to the other gases.? The data of Hall (1991) on global biofu-
els combustion indicate that methane emissions from this source in
1988 amounted to approximately 14 million tons. The GWP is
about 100 million tons of carbon-equivalent, which compares to
global CO, emissions from human settlements of approximately
1.7 billion tons carbon (C) (for a 100-year time horizon).

depends greatly on income growth and distribution, household
size, and the cost of housing and home appliances. The real cost
of most appliances has declined over time, which means that
households outside the industrialized countries can acquire them
at lower income levels than was the case for industrial-country
households in the past. Levels of energy-using activity do not
expand linearly with income because saturation of major ener-

Lastly, retrofits—such as the addition of insulation, and storm

reduced electricity use by 28% relative to the average model
produced in 1989 (Turiel et al., 1991). Advanced compressors,
evacuated panel insulation, and other features have the poten-
tial to produce commercial and cost-effective refrigerators that
consume half as much electricity per unit volume as those that
meet the 1993 standard. Such a refrigerator would consume
20% as much electricity as a typical 1972 U.S. model. Recent

"Although the modern sector of developing countries shares
many of these opportunities, there is an important difference:
The energy consumption in developing countries is much lower
but generally has higher rates of growth, because of population
increase as well as the increase in energy services per capita.
Thus, opportunities are more significant in new buildings and
equipment than in retrofits. There also are opportunities unique
to developing countries. The overall potential for CO, emis-
sions reduction through energy-efficiency improvement and
fuel switching is illustrated in Table 22-1 for India. Emissions
reductions of 40 Mt (35%) from 1987-88 emission levels are
projected. By the year 2010, with a 1.46-fold increase in pop-
ulation and a doubling of the per capita demand for energy ser-

"The commercial sector is especially diverse, even within a sin-

fuels used, operating hours, functions served within buildings,
amenity levels, and climates. Larger commercial buildings dif-
fer from residential buildings because they tend to have more
complex space-conditioning systems (often with mechanical
ventilation systems to maintain indoor air quality) and are usu-
ally internal-load dominated—meaning that space-conditioning
demands arise largely from activities within the building (e.g.,
people, lighting, and equipment) rather than from exterior con-
ditions. In industrialized countries, commercial buildings tend
to be relatively large (e.g., in the United States, 80% of the
commercial floor area is in buildings larger than 1,000 m2) and
designed for high amenity levels in terms of thermal and light-

with fewer amenities—though the trend is toward the styles of
industrialized countries. Commercial building types include
offices, hotels, retail stores, schools, health-care facilities, food-

"A lamp ballast is needed to provide a suitable starting voltage,
thereafter limiting current flow during operation of fluorescent
(and mercury-vapor) lamps. Ordinary magnetic ballasts dissi-
pate about 20% of the total power entering a fixture (Geller and
Miller, 1988). In some developing countries, poor-quality bal-
lasts may dissipate as much as 30% (Turiel et al., 1990). More
efficient electromagnetic ballasts (also known as core/coil bal-
lasts) make use of better materials to reduce ballast losses to
about 10%. Solid-state electronic ballasts cut ballast losses even
further and also increase lamp efficacy (lumens of light output
per watt of power input) because of high-frequency operation.
Such ballasts increase the efficiency of the ballast/lamp system
by approximately 20 to 25% relative to that of a system with an
ordinary ballast (Verderber, 1988).

The combination of reduced reflectivity (called “albedo”) and

a lack of information about the amount of organic material
actually disposed of in landfills or open dumps by different

of organic wastes that decompose anaerobically, and the extent
to which these wastes will ultimately decompose (Bingemer

"Many buildings are rented, causing a separation
between those purchasing energy-using equipment
and those paying to operate the equipment.
Individuals pursue several goals when making energy-
related decisions (such as minimizing capital outlays),
but very few pursue the goal of minimizing life-cycle
or societal costs (see Komor and Wiggins, 1988).

In new construction, where the greatest and most cost-
effective savings are available, the builder does not
have to face paying energy bills and often works to
minimize initial cost.

Energy costs are relatively low (e.g., about 1% of
salary costs in a typical office in industrialized coun-

focus their attention elsewhere.

"Options for reducing the source of methane emissions include
recycling paper products, composting, and incineration (U.S.
EPA, 1993d). Paper products make up a significant part of
solid waste in industrialized countries (e.g., 40% in the United
States) and a growing proportion in some urban centers of
developing countries (typically 5 to 20%) (U.S. AID, 1988;
Volger, 1984). A variety of recycling processes, differing in
technical complexity, can turn this waste into material indis-
tinguishable from virgin products. Composting—an aerobic
process for treating moist organic wastes that generates little or
no methane—is most applicable in developing countries,
where this type of waste makes up a larger fraction of the total;
the residue has fertilizer value. As land-disposal costs rise,
incineration (often combined with combustion-energy recov-
ery) has become more cost-effective, especially in lower mois-
ture landfills found in industrialized countries.

"With available technologies and practices, methane emissions
may be reduced either by recovering and using the gas or by’
reducing the source of methane (U.S. EPA, 1993d). The former
approach is most suitable for existing solid-waste disposal
sites, which often emit methane (often called landfill gas) for
10 to 30 years or more (RIVM, 1993). Frequently, more than
50% of the generated methane can be recovered (Bhide et al.,
1990). In many cases, the recovered methane can be used for
heating or electricity generation, which is already common in
many countries. Although more expensive, landfill gas also
can be purified and injected into a natural-gas pipeline or dis-
tribution system; there are several such projects in the United
States. In Brazil, purified landfill gas has been used as a fuel to
power a fleet of garbage trucks and taxicabs. High-rate anaer-
obic processes for the treatment of liquid effluents with high
organic content (sewage, food-processing wastes, etc.) can
help reduce uncontrolled methane emissions and are particu-
larly suited to the warmer climates of most developing coun-

"Financial incentives to increase energy efficiency—including
grants and low-interest loans for building retrofits, rebates for

For example, 84% of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)
budget devoted exclusively to buildings energy conservation
(including research and development) is in the form of grants
for retrofits to existing buildings; these grants totaled $230
million in 1991 (U.S. Congress, OTA, 1992a). Similarly,
electric and gas utilities are spending an increasing fraction of
their demand-side budgets on rebates and direct-payment

"Energy taxes can raise a tremendous amount of rev-
enue, often at relatively low administrative costs. For
example, a 0.1 cent (1 mill) per kWh tax on electrici-
ty used in buildings in the United States would raise
about $1.7 billion annually (EIA, 1993).

There is only moderate agreement on the effects of
price changes on energy consumption or behavior.
Estimates of the price elasticity of energy demand
(defined as the percent change in energy consumption
resulting from a 1% change in price) range from -0.3
to -1.0 for the buildings sector (Energy Modeling
Forum, 1981).

Taxes may have undesired distributional effects. For
example, in the United States, low-income households
spend a larger fraction of their income on energy ser-
vices than do higher income households. Therefore, an
energy tax would be regressive (USDOC, 1993),
Energy taxes also can be an instrument of income
redistribution. Many countries tax gasoline and use a
part of the revenues for social expenditures, such as
universal health care and education. For example, a
small tax on urban electricity consumption in Argentina
is used to finance the expansion of rural electrification.

expensive for a utility to install energy-efficient lights in
offices than to build a new power plant to meet the demand of
less-efficient lights. The service provided is the same, but the
overall cost to provide it may be lower. IRP is the process of
evaluating demand and supply options together to determine
how to meet energy-service needs at the lowest cost.

put increasing pressure on utilities to better plan their future

"Often, many groups are responsible for different aspects of
waste management. Any one weakness in the chain of respon-
sibility can cause failures in the overall waste-management
system. Furthermore, different groups generally are responsi-
ble for energy generation, fertilizer supply, and waste manage-

the data in Table 22-3 and shows the annual growth rates of ener-

"In many developing countries, projects with higher initial costs
that are otherwise profitable are not undertaken because of lack
of capital for investment (often resulting from uncertain finan-
cial institutions that make capital difficult to attract), Also, as
noted, many developing countries have highly subsidized ener-
gy prices that make methane recovery not cost-effective.
Financing of methane recovery (such as that carried out in China
under the auspices of the Global Environment Facility) can help
solve these problems, as can the deregulation of energy prices.

"Average energy growth in buildings between 1973
and 1990 worldwide was 2.5% per year, compared
with an average increase in energy use in all sectors of
2.7% per year during the same period.

Average annual increase in CO, emissions was 1.2%
per year. Thus, the carbon emissions increased an
average of 1.3% less per year than buildings energy
use between 1973 and 1990, indicating an improve-
ment in carbon intensity (carbon emissions per unit of
buildings energy use).

"The scenarios discussed below focus on GHG emissions from
energy consumption in buildings because buildings represent
75% of the emissions treated in this chapter. It is likely, how-
ever, that two of the other three sources of GHG emissions
from human settlements—methane from landfills and waste-
water—could be controlled as much as CO, emissions result-
ing from energy use in buildings. The third source, PICs from
burning of biomass in cookstoves, is likely to be largely elim-

replaced by modern fuel forms.

Many policies work in combination with others.
Mutually reinforcing regulatory, information, incen-

Finally, policy experimentation should be encouraged
on a small scale. The process of experimenting, eval-

"In the OECD, there was almost no increase in carbon
emissions from buildings energy use between 1973 and
1990 (0.2 % per year); however, the annual growth of
carbon emissions from energy consumption went from
-0.6% (1973 to 1983) to +1.3% (1983 to 1990).

In the FSU/EE, energy use in buildings increased relative-
ly steadily from 1973 to 1990; however, the rate of growth
in carbon emissions from energy used in buildings
declined from 4.0% per year (1973 to 1983) to 1.9% per
year (1983 to 1990). After 1990, energy use in the region
declined because of the economic disintegration experi-
enced as an aftermath of the breakup of the Soviet Union.
The average increase in energy use in buildings in
developing countries from 1973 to 1990 was 5.8%;
the annual increase in carbon emissions was 4.4%.
Overall, residential buildings use about twice as much
energy and are responsible for about twice the carbon
emissions as commercial buildings. However, annual
energy use in commercial buildings has grown over
35% faster between 1973 and 1990, and their annual
carbon emissions have grown 60% faster.

ing the past 2 decades), with considerable emphasis on energy
efficiency in these reference cases and most of the energy growth
in the developing world, aggressive policies to increase energy

"The WEC case shows almost the entire energy growth during
the period occurring in the developing world. The IPCC and
GEEI cases have about 70% of energy growth happening in the
developing world. In spite of this concentration of growth, ener-
gy per capita in the developing world in all of the reference
cases remains a small fraction of that in the industrialized coun-
tries. For example, in IPCC reference cases IS92a and IS92b,
energy per capita in developing countries grows from 10% of
that of industrialized countries in 1990 to 17.5% in 2025.

"On the one hand, this close agreement among the different groups
on an expected reference case for energy in the year 2025 is sur-
prising because of the tremendous number of unknowns about
future energy demand. As noted in Section 24.3, a large number of
factors influence energy demand growth. The average annual
growth in energy demand since 1973 has been about 2.4% per year
(with energy in buildings growing at 2.1% per year during the peri-
od). Thus, the similarity among the scenarios reveals that the best
guess about the future is that it will be much like the past. In this
case, it appears that analysts implicitly assume that the next three
decades will be much like the two decades since the oil embargo.

to promote energy efficiency could be responsible for about
30% to 60% of the effort needed to achieve zero growth in car-

energy growth by 0.6% per year from the reference case. The
other is an extremely high-efficiency case with a “rate of reduc-
tion in energy intensity far in excess of anything achieved his-
torically” and a “very low increase in energy demand in the
developing countries.” In this second case, energy growth dimin-
ishes an additional 0.6% per year, resulting in an increase in
energy demand of 0.9% per year. In this case, the energy con-

Environmental Protection Agency produced policy scenarios
that are useful in a general way in indicating global energy-
efficiency opportunities for 2025 and beyond (U.S. EPA,
1990). The Rapidly Changing World scenarios most nearly
approximate the WEC and GEEI cases considered above.
Policies promoting energy efficiency reduce the annual growth
rate of energy by 0.5% per year, from 1.95 to 1.43% annually,
from the present to 2025. In the other major pair of reference
and policy cases analyzed by EPA, the Slowly Changing World
scenarios, energy demand was reduced by 0.41% per year, but
from a much lower growth rate of 1.07% per year.

(IPCC, 1995). Carbon emissions vary much more than energy

can be used. In reviewing a large number of global scenarios for
the year 2100, the IPCC (1995) notes that energy intensity varies
by less than a factor of 3. More specifically, the different scenar-
ios calculate (or assume) an energy intensity index varying from
about 0.2 to 0.55 for 2100, whereas the index is 1.0 today (the
index is a measure of energy use per unit gross world product).

"Goldemberg et al. (1987a, 1987b, 1988) describe end-use ori-

in which per capita energy use can decline by substantial
amounts. They also provide energy strategies for developing
countries that increase per capita energy use to meet needed
energy services and avoid inefficient energy uses. While the
authors carry their analysis only to 2020, their ideas apply well
to a longer term view in which major transformations in all
energy-using stock will take place.

"This review of long-term scenarios suggests that one might
expect energy use in 2100 to be about two to three times that
of 2025 if the world economy grows at a modest rate (e.g., 2%)
during the period and population growth declines to about
0.4% per year. Lower economic and population growth could
significantly lower the energy projection, and higher growth
rates would increase it. We believe that this review of energy
scenarios applies well to energy in buildings as well. Most
long-term scenarios for energy show buildings using 30 to 35%
of total energy, both at present and in the long term.

"Thus, in this very aggregate view, if gross world product grows
to about 4.5 times 2025 levels by 2100 (as assumed in IPCC
1S92a and b), then global energy use by 2100 might be expected
to grow by a factor of about two to three times that of 2025.
Higher and lower growth rates of gross world product per capita
and of population would increase or decrease energy growth in
this period accordingly. The most extreme of the six IPCC cases
has gross world product per capita growing somewhat more than
twice and less than half the size of the base case in 2100; popula-
tion projections also show significant variations by 2100.

"	Title
"The primary sources of N,O are mineral fertilizers, legume
cropping, and animal waste. Some N,O also is emitted from
biomass burning. N,O emissions from agriculture could be
reduced by 9-26% by improving agricultural management
with available techniques.
"	Text
"Biofuel production on 10~15% of the land area currently in
agricultural use or in agricultural set-asides could substitute for
300-1,300 Mt of fossil fuel C per year. Recovery and conver-
sion of crop residues could substitute for an additional
100-200 Mt fossil fuel C per year. However, the possible off-
sets by increased N,O emissions need to be considered.
"	Text
"Energy use by agriculture relative to farm production has
decreased greatly since the 1970s. Fossil fuel use by agricul-
ture in industrialized countries, although constituting only
3-4% of overall consumption, can be further reduced by, for
example, minimum tillage, irrigation scheduling, solar drying
of crops, and improved fertilizer management.
"	Text
"Ranges in estimates of potential mitigation reflect uncertainty in
the effectiveness of recommended management options and in
the degree of future implementation globally. Comprehensive
model-based analyses and improved global databases on soils,
land use, and trace gas fluxes are needed to reduce the uncer-
tainty in these estimates.
"	Text
"Agriculture accounts for one-fifth of the annual increase in
anthropogenic greenhouse warming. Most of this is due to
methane (CH,) and nitrous oxide (N,O); agriculture produces
about 50 and 70%, respectively, of their anthropogenic emis-
sions. This chapter on mitigation options confirms earlier IPCC
estimates and quantifies potential contributions by agriculture
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. ~
"	Text
"Farmers will not voluntarily adopt greenhouse gas (GHG) mit-
igation techniques unless they improve profitability. Some
techniques, such as no-till agriculture or strategic fertilizer
placement and timing, already are being adopted for reasons
other than concern for climate change. Proposed options for
reducing GHG emissions are consistent with maintaining or
increasing agricultural productivity.
"	Text
"Between 400 and 800 Mt C/yr could be sequestered worldwide
in agricultural soils by implementation of appropriate manage-
ment practices to increase productivity—including increased
input of crop residues, reduced tillage, and restoration of
wasteland soils. However, soil carbon (C) sequestration has a
finite capacity over a period of 50-100 years, as new equilibri-
um levels of soil organic matter are established.
"	Text
"Significant decreases in CH, emissions from agriculture can be
achieved through improved nutrition of ruminant animals and
better management of paddy rice fields. Additional CH,
decreases are possible by altered treatment and management of
animal wastes and by reduction of biomass burning. These
combined practices could reduce CH, emissions from agricul-
ture by 15-56%.

importance of N,O emissions from heavily fertilized soils was
further emphasized, but the quantities involved still remained
highly uncertain.

"Global food production needs and farmer/society acceptability
considerations suggest that mitigation technologies should
meet the following general guidelines: (1) agricultural produc-
tion levels will be maintained or enhanced in parts of the world
where food production and population demand are in delicate
balance; (2) additional benefits will accrue to the farmer (e.g.,
reduced labor, reduced or more efficient use of inputs); (3)
agricultural products will be accepted by local consumers.

"Agriculture contributes significantly to anthropogenic emis-
sions of carbon dioxide (CO), methane (CH,), and nitrous
oxide (N,O). Based on IPCC data (IPCC, 1994) and additional
estimates described below, agriculture accounts for about one-
fifth of the annual increase in radiative forcing (Figure 23-1).
Land-use changes related to agriculture especially in the trop-
ics, including biomass burning and soil degradation, are also
major contributors.

"Since then, the availability of new regional and global data-
bases (FAO, 1990a, 1990b, 1990c; Eswaran et al., 1993;
Sombroek et al., 1993), additional site-specific measurements,
and the utilization of more thoroughly tested simulation mod-
els (Raich et al., 1991; Ojima et al., 1993c; Parton et al., 1993;
Potter et al., 1993) have improved the possibilities for quan-
tification. However, information concerning greenhouse gas
(GHG) fluxes from agricultural systems is still limited.

"Options to mitigate CO, emissions from agriculture and land-
use changes include the reduction of emissions from present
sources and the creation and strengthening of carbon sinks.
Increasing the role of agricultural land as a sink for CO,
includes C storage in managed soils and C sequestration after
reversion of surplus farm lands to natural ecosystems (Follett,
1993). Biofuel production on agricultural lands has a consider-
able potential for mitigation of CO, emissions by providing C
offsets to use of fossil fuel.

"The IPCC First Assessment Report (IPCC, 1990a, 1990b) con-
cluded that land-use changes are the most important source of
anthropogenic CO, after fossil fuel combustion. Improving the
productivity of existing farmland was proposed to mitigate
these emissions. Regarding the other two trace gases, it was
suggested that CH, from rice fields could be reduced by
20-40% and CH, from ruminant animals by 25-75%.
Improving Nitrogen (N) fertilizer efficiency and minimizing N
surpluses were cited as important approaches for reducing agri-
cultural N,O emissions, but no quantitative assessment was
made at that time.

"In temperate regions there is little development of new agri-
cultural lands, and in regions with food surpluses (e.g., United
States, Canada, Western Europe) the agricultural land base is
being reduced. A similar situation may occur in the longer term
for countries in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union
(FSU) as per area productivity increases. Thus, the reversion of
marginal agricultural land to forest (including shelterbelts and
plantations), grassland, and wetlands represents a potential for
C sequestration.

"Upon release from agricultural production, C sequestration
would continue only until soils reached a new equilibrium
value, most of which would be realized over a 50-100 year
period. An exception is the case of reversion to wetlands,
where the buildup of organic soils provides a more sustained C
sink. About 8 Mha of organic soil-wetlands are currently under
cultivation in the temperate zone. As of 1980, these soils were
estimated to provide a net C source of ~5 Mt/yr, but represent
a potential sink of ~55 Mt C/yr in their native state, with sus-
tained rates of C accumulation of 20-225 g C/m?yr
(Amentano and Menges, 1986).

"Conservation Reserve Program, started in 1985, is scheduled to
begin expiring in 1996, and 75% of the land is expected to
return to agriculture by 2005 unless the program is extended.
The EU agricultural set-aside programs are for 1-5 years and
can include annual cropping for non-food production (e.g.,
oilseed for fuel), although separate programs exist for tree
planting. Because C stocks are likely to be depleted again when
lands are returned to cultivation, short duration set-asides have
little or no effect on C sequestration. If soils are left unculti-
vated and allowed to revert to native vegetation, C contents in
upper soil horizons could eventually reach levels comparable
to their precultivation condition. Considering the ~640 Mha of
cropland with real or potential surpluses (United States,
Canada, FSU, Europe, Australia, and Argentina) and assuming
recovery of the soil C originally lost due to cultivation
(25-30% per Davidson and Ackerman, 1993), a permanent set-
aside of 15% of the land area might sequester 1.5-3 Gt C.

"An estimate based on the distribution of cultivated soils across
major soil groups, their associated C contents, and average loss
rates due to cultivation yields a current global stock in cultivat-
ed lands of 167 Gt C and a historical loss from these soils of 55
Gt C (Table 23-3), Comparable estimates have been obtained by
Houghton and coworkers (Houghton et al., 1983; Houghton and
Skole, 1990) from a more detailed analysis of historical land-
use data. They estimated global losses of soil C since 1860 to be
30 Gt C (15% of the total 170 Gt C lost from vegetation and
soils), or 41 Gt C since the beginning of settled agriculture
(Houghton and Skole, 1990). These land use-based estimates do
not include C loss from drainage of wetland soils, which could
account for the higher value calculated in Table 23-3.

"These global estimates of C loss from cultivated soils provide
a reference level for the C sequestration that might be achieved
through improved management. Increasing C levels in artifi-
cially drained wetland soils (e.g., Histosols) is unlikely except
in cases where they are reverted to wetlands. Therefore, the
potential to increase C levels in cultivated systems is largely
restricted to upland soils. Assuming a recovery of one-half to
two-thirds of historic C losses as a reasonable upper limit, the
global potential for C sequestration in cultivated soils over the
next 50-100 years would be on the order of 20-30 Gt. This
would require increased production and major improvements
in management on much of the world’s cultivated areas, par-
ticularly in less-developed regions. Under current conditions, it

"The decrease in soil C with permanent cultivation is of the
same order as that for temperate regions, often 20-50% or
more, although C losses typically are more rapid in the tropics.
It is estimated that arable land and pasture use in the tropics
currently contributes a net C flux of 90-230 Mt C annually
(Lal and Logan, in press). Decreases in soil C are a result of
lower organic matter inputs relative to native systems,
enhanced decomposition rates, and/or erosion. Management to
increase soil C levels is a high priority for improving the pro-
ductivity and sustainability of tropical agricultural systems
(Swift and Sanchez, 1984). Opportunities to increase soil C
levels include improved management of presently cultivated
land and the restoration of degraded lands. The latter will
include conversion to nonagricultural uses such as forest or
biofuel production, but some areas may be suitable for agricul-
tural production as well.

availability is the main determinant of productivity, and the use
of reduced tillage and mulching to increase available water and

C sink (Oldeman et al., 1990). In the tropical and subtropical
regions of China, about 48 Mha is classified as “wasteland,”
of which 80% is considered suitable for forestry and 8% and
6% could be restored as cropland and pasture, respectively
(Zhao, pers. comm.). Based on field experiments, net C
increases in soils reclaimed for agriculture are on the order of
2.4 kg C/m? over a 10-year period, which represents a net C
sink of 92 Mt C. Higher increases could be obtained for the
larger area suitable for reforestation. In India, more than 100
Mha are classified as degraded and greatly depleted in soil C.
Experiments have shown that salt- and alkali-affected soils
have a relatively high potential for C sequestration if suitable
tree and grass species and water management measures are
used (Gupta and Rao, 1994). These authors estimated that a
restoration of 35 Mha of wasteland area in India could
sequester up to 2 Gt C.

"Most temperate agricultural soils have been cultivated for
decades to centuries, and most probably have attained a C
content close to equilibrium value. Very little land in the tem-
perate zone is currently being converted to agriculture. For
industrialized agriculture (ie., United States, EU), soil C
probably is increasing slightly due to increased productivity
and hence greater crop residue inputs, improved residue man-
agement, and reduced tillage. In less industrialized agricul-
ture (e.g., FSU) and in areas that have been brought into cul-
tivation more recently, soil C probably is decreasing slightly.
As a first approximation, it is reasonable to assume that tem-
perate agricultural soils are not a large source or sink of C
under current practices (Cole et al., 1993; Sauerbeck, 1993),
However, soil organic C in permanently cropped fields can be
increased through a number of management practices, includ-
ing greater returns of organic materials to soil, decreased
periods of fallow, use of perennial and winter cover crops,
recycling of organic wastes, reduced tillage, erosion control,
and agroforestry.

"In sub-humid and humid zones, CO, mitigation potentials are
higher. With greater water availability, the physical condition
and fertility of soils become more important as production con-
straints. The inherent physical conditions of these soils are gen-
erally good but can be degraded with intensive tillage. Reduced
tillage, mulch farming, alley cropping, and other agroforestry
practices can contribute to maintenance of soil structure and
reduction of erosion and can provide increased organic matter
inputs and reduced decomposition rates (by reducing soil tem-
peratures and soil disturbance). In wetland soils, especially
paddy fields, low aeration slows decomposition and leads to
high C contents, especially in continuously wet soils. When
soils dry up during part of the cropping cycle, C contents will
decrease unless green manures or large amounts of crop
residues (e.g., wheat) are produced in the dry season. The
widespread burning of rice straw reduces organic C inputs to
the soil. Higher C stocks in wetland soils generally increase
CH, emissions, although better water management can help
control CH, emissions.

However, several studies have shown genuine increases in
SOC as a result of reduced tillage (e.g., Dick et al., 1986;

increased use of cover crops, increased adoption of reduced

remain within 5% of the current area; that there would be a
major reduction in summer/fallow in the Chernozemic soil

increased fertilizer use, improved residue management with
reduced tillage, and better erosion control. Over a 50-year peri-

"The fixation of atmospheric N into synthetic fertilizer requires
about 1.2 kg of fossil C equivalents for each kg of fixed N.
Therefore, the present global consumption of about 80 Mt fertil-

not increase much further, it is predicted to double in developing
countries by the year 2025 (IPCC, 1992; Sauerbeck, 1994a).
Accordingly, the energy required for manufacturing N fertilizers
will increase to about 150 Mt fossil C annually. In Southeast
Asia, for example, a 30% increase in the use of fossil fuel is con-
sidered necessary by the year 2000, if food production is to fol-

(Enquete Commission, 1995). As an example, Haas et al.
(1995a, 1995b) calculated that organic farm systems in
Germany emit only 39% of the overall fossil C required by
conventional farms. This is due mainly to the replacement of
mineral N fertilizers by legume cropping, balanced animal
stocking rates, and a much lower consumption of feed concen-
trates (Koepf et al., 1988; Enquete Commission, 1995). Even
energy inputs per ton of harvested crop were lower by 20-60%

replace fossil fuels. These vary widely, however, in terms of
the feasibility of collecting and transporting residues, as well
as the extent to which crop residues can be removed from
fields without adversely affecting soil C levels and site pro-
ductivity. In general, it is estimated that only 50% of the
residues can be removed without affecting future soil produc-

energy purposes (Sampson ef al., 1993). Hall et al. (1993)
estimate that for the world’s major crops (wheat, rice, corn,
barley, and sugarcane), a 25% residue recovery rate would
amount to an annual C amount of 357 Mt. Much of this would
be used for heating and cooking, without substituting for coal

used are of limited value in reducing CO, emissions, due to the
low net energy produced and the relatively high fossil fuel
inputs required (Marland and Turhollow, 1991; Flaig and
Mohr, 1994). Providing one energy equivalent as rapeseed oil
requires about 0.5-0.6 equivalents as fossil fuel, and if
bioethanol is produced from grains or root crops, the net ener-
gy gain may be as low as 13-20% (Leible and Wintzer, 1993;
Graef et al., 1994). However, when using sugarcane, the cane
waste provides most of the production energy, resulting in a
ratio of ethanol energy to the input of fossil fuel of about 5.2
(Goldemberg et al., 1993). Similarly, palm oil obtained in mills
driven by residue fuel at yields of 4-5 t/ha can compete with
diesel costs at an energy output versus fossil energy input ratio
of 9:5 (Wood and Conley, 1991). The burning of whole-plant
biomass as an alternative to fossil fuel results in the most sig-
nificant CO, mitigation (Leible and Wintzer, 1993; Reinhardt,

stocks and those possible under improved management, con-
sidering that most of the increase in C would occur within a 50-
to 100-year time frame. An exception is C accumulation in
wetlands, where C increases can be sustained for much longer
periods. Reductions in fossil C consumption by agriculture and
the production of biofuels are mitigation options that can, in

"Large amounts of C could be sequestered in soils (23-44 Gt
over a 50-year period) through improved management of agri-
cultural land, permanent set-asides, and restoration of degrad-
ed lands. Increasing soil C levels has additional benefits in
terms of improving the productivity and sustainability of agri-
cultural production systems. There are potential costs associat-
ed with promoting C storage, including fossil fuel require-
ments (e.g., fertilizers), lost production (e.g., set-aside pro-
grams), and additional labor and financial requirements (e.g.,
land restoration), which may constrain the potential for
increasing C storage. Direct fossil fuel use by agriculture is a
relatively minor portion of society’s total consumption; there-
fore, even high reductions in use within agriculture have a
modest mitigation potential.

"Sections 23.3.1.1 and 23.3.1.2 provide a new assessment of
agricultural sources and sinks of CH, and sources of N,O.
Appraisal of mitigation potential in agricultural systems is
based on these estimates and the management technology
available. The sources of CH, considered important include
ruminant animals, rice production, animal waste, and biomass
burning, while agricultural land use impacts the aerobic soil
sink for atmospheric CH,. The direct and indirect production of
N,O in fertilized systems are considered to be the major agri-
cultural source of NO. Other sources—such as biomass burn-
ing, enhanced production of N,O after burning, and increased
N,O production after forest clearing for agriculture—are
smaller and are given less rigorous attention. Animal feeding
operations are considered minor N,O sources that are not yet
adequately characterized.

"Significant emissions of CH, also occur from animal waste,
varying with waste type and management practice (Safley et
al., 1992; U.S. EPA, 1993). In general, manures from animals
having a high-quality diet have higher potential to generate
CH, than manures from animals having a low-quality diet.
Actual CH, emission values depend on the amount of manure
produced, its potential to generate CH,, manure handling prac-

"Estimated potentials for adoption of these practices and associ-
ated CH, reductions are shown in Table 23-6. The greatest
opportunity for reducing CH, emissions from ruminants is
through feed supplementation of cattle and buffalo in Africa,
Asia, and Latin America (Leng, 1991; Lin et al., 1994).
Supplementation of the diets of native cattle/buffalo in India
has been shown to decrease CH, emissions per liter of milk
produced by a factor of three and per ton of live weight gain by
a factor of six (Leng, 1991).

"U.S. EPA, 1992). For beef cattle, pharmaceuticals being devel-
oped that promote protein gain at the expense of fat could
reduce CH, emissions by as much as 20% (CAST, 1992).
Longer-term opportunities include the production of twins to
reduce the need for breeding animals and biotechnological
approaches to modify rumen fermentation (CAST, 1992; U.S.
EPA, 1992). Overall, the combination of these mitigation
options could decrease CH, emissions from ruminant animals
by approximately 30% (Table 23-6). However, increasing food
quality may result in increased N,O emissions and increased
energy use, thereby decreasing the effect of the estimated
decreases in CH, emissions (Ward et al., 1993).

"A variety of feed additives (e.g., antibiotics,
ionophore antibiotics and steroids) increase growth
rate and increase the feed efficiency of beef cattle,
resulting in 5—15% less methane per unit of product
(U.S. EPA, 1992).

Somatotropin (bST) to increase milk production,
recently approved in the United States and in several
other countries, is projected to reduce methane by 9%
if adopted for all dairy cows in the United States
(Johnson et al., 1991).

Treatment of cereal straws with ammonia is a much-
researched method and increases digestibility and
intake, but increases in methane per kg of straw have
been found (Birkelo et al., 1986).

"The relatively constant CH, emissions as percent of diet for
most of the world’s livestock has important implications for
mitigation strategy. Strategies targeting increased available
energy per unit of feedstuff will decrease intake required per
unit of product (meat, milk, etc.). Improved feeding and animal
management is the only strategy, to date, that has consistently
reduced methane emissions. Almost all improved livestock
management practices reduce methane per unit of product, and
while increased diet energy availability is usually central to the
improved practice, a whole array of interrelated inputs are
required (protein, minerals, vitamins, improved genetics,
reproductive efficiency, animal health, predator control, etc.).
The trend worldwide is toward these improved technologies,
limited mostly by the market price of animal products.

"Global CH, emissions from livestock manure were an estimat-
ed 20-30 Mt/yr (Safley et al., 1992). More recently, the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency estimated this source to con-
tribute 10-18 Mt/yr (Gibbs and Woodbury, 1993); a value of 14
Mt CH,/yr is used here. Manure management systems that
store manure under anaerobic conditions contribute about 60%
of CH, of this source because CH, is produced during anaero-
bic decomposition of organic materials in manure (U.S. EPA,
1994). Methane lost from anaerobic digestion constitutes a
wasted energy source that can be recovered by using manure
management and treatment practices adapted for CH, collec-
tion (Hogan, 1993). With current technology, CH, emissions
can be reduced by 25 to 80%. Hogan (1993) identified CH,

mate is that 40% of the CH, from these regions could
be mitigated using this approach.

to utilize anaerobic decomposition of organic materi-

strongly affected by the composition and texture of soil and its
content of inorganic electron acceptors (Neue, 1992), The peri-

Range of estimates.
About 50% of total rice area and 60% of total rice grain produced is under irrigation (Neue, 1992). Methane production is
higher in continually flooded systems and with greater biomass production (Sass et al., 1991). Sass et al. (1992) showed tha
draining the field at specific times decreased CH, production by 88% without decreasing rice yield. The effect will probabl:
not be better than 50% when used in the field. The ability to control flooding and drainage will be available to no more thai
30% of the total production.

Lindau et al. (1993) showed that CH, emissions can be decreased by adding sodium sulfate (by 28-35%) or coated calcium carbide
(by 36%) with urea compared to urea alone, and by using ammonium sulfate (20%) in place of urea. With all these approaches,
CHy production could be decreased by about 20%, We assume that this potential can be utilized for all rice production.

Further mitigation potentials are likely to exist in optimizing rice cultivars and other management practices (Neue, 1992;
Sass et al., 1992; Lin et al., 1994; Sass, 1994). In controlled experiments, a decrease of about 20% was demonstrated for
some of these approaches. An estimated 10% reduction can be achieved from global rice production. Composting rice
straw before field application also decreases CH, from rice fields (Yagi and Minami, 1990).

Drying the soil surface during the cropping season may increase N,O emissions. The net effect of both gases needs to be
evaluated before the practice can be recommended.

"The burning of biomass results in the emission of CH, because of
incomplete combustion. Emission factors for CH, (i.e., the frac-
tion relative to emitted CO.) vary greatly (0.1% to 2.5%) depend-
ing on whether the fire is hot, flaming, or smoldering combustion
(Levine et al., 1993). In response to declining agricultural yields
and increasing population pressures, farmers in many regions
convert forests to cropping land, and many of their techniques
involve burning. For example, shifting cultivation requires that
forests be cut, and logging debris and unwanted vegetation
burned; the land is then farmed for several years, then left fallow
to rejuvenate. Savanna and rangeland biomass is often burned to
improve livestock forage. Agricultural residues are also burned in
the field to return nutrients to the soil or reduce shrubs on rota-
tional fallow lands. Such agriculture-related burning may account
for 50% of the biomass bumed annually. In addition, about 50%
of the worldwide crop residues are bummed in small-scale cooking

"Revised emission estimates: Minami (1993) proposed the

world rice paddy fields. A review of CH, studies in China, India,
Japan, Thailand, the Philippines, and the United States (Sass,
1994) tightened the range of projected CH, emissions from rice
fields. In his calculations, Sass combined the data for total area of
tice paddies with the flux estimates published in various chapters
of Minami et al. (1994) to produce Table 23-7. For China and
India, the annual CH, flux estimates were specified by Wang et
al, (1994) and Parashar et al. (1994), respectively. In the other
cases, the figures are based on the minimum and maximum
reported emission averages. The rice areas in the countries shown
in Sass’ estimate represent 63% of the total world rice paddy area
and result in a total annual CH, emission of 16 to 34 Mt.
Extrapolating these data to the world, Sass estimates total CH,
emissions from rice fields to range between 25.4 and 54 Mt/yr,
with 50 Mt/yr as a best-guess global emission value. This value
is near the IPCC (1992) best estimate of 60 Mt CH,/yr, but the
range indicates that the actual rate may be lower. Wang et al.
(1994) estimated the annual CH, emissions from rice in China to
range between 13 and 17 Mt/yr. Lin et al. (1994) estimated a
slightly lower value from rice in China of <12 Mt CH,/yr.

"By better matching N supply to crop demand and more close-
ly integrating animal waste and crop-residue management with
crop production, N,O emissions could be decreased by about
0.38 Mt N,O-N. Further improvements in farm technology,
such as use of controlled-release fertilizers, nitrification
inhibitors, timing, and water management, should lead to
improvements in N use efficiency and further limit NO pro-
duction by an estimated 0.30 Mt N,O-N. A total potential
reduction of global N,O emissions from agricultural soils is
thus 0.7 (0.34 to 1.0) Mt N,O-N/yr.

"From Table 23-10 the amount of N,O-N that is amenable to
management is estimated. In these calculations, it is assumed
that two-thirds of the N,O from N applied as manure or syn-
thetic fertilizer is directly emitted from agricultural systems.
The remaining one-third is emitted indirectly as a result of
runoff, nitrate leaching, and transfer of N to other sections of
the ecosystem through NH, and NO, emissions. Only the direct
emissions are readily amenable to control by on-farm manage-
ment, but management options that decrease the amount of
external N needed to produce a crop also will decrease indirect
N,O production. It was also assumed that N,O produced direct-
ly from biological N fixation cannot be managed. These esti-
mates were based upon estimated fertilizer use and animal N
production in FAO (1990b); thus, they represent estimates for
that year and are not future projections.

save 20% of N applied in North America, Europe, and FSU

Peoples et al., 1995).

» Tightening N cycles may decrease the need for 20% of the
N that is used currently in North America, Europe, and
FSU, thus saving 20% of fertilizer and reducing N,O from
manure by the same amount where applicable (Buresh et

"A significant fraction of the N,O evolved from agricultural
systems could be avoided if some combination of agricultur-
al management practices listed in Table 23-10 were adopted
worldwide. These practices are recommended mainly to
improve synthetic fertilizer and manure N use efficiency.
The underlying concept in limiting NO emissions is that if
fertilizer N (all N applied to improve crop growth) is utilized
better by the crop, the amount of N needed to meet the grow-
ing demand for food will be less; therefore, less N,O will be
produced and less N will leak from the system (Isermann,
1994b; Sauerbeck, 1994a, 1994b). Some of these practices,
such as use of nitrification inhibitors, have been shown to
have a direct effect on decreasing N,O emissions in field
studies (Aulakh eg al., 1984; Minami et al., 1990; Bronson et
al., 1992), Ryden (1981) and McTaggart et al. (1994) have
shown that timing of application of different types of syn-
thetic fertilizer with seasonal water distribution can limit
N,O production.

utilization of fertilizer N. This could decrease N,O emissions

in enhanced emissions of N,O from soil (Anderson et al., 1988;
Anderson and Poth, 1989). Bouwman (1993) and Bouwman et

volatilized as NH, and that 1%, 0.1 Mt/yr, of the remaining N is

"Uncertainties in our present assessment stem from two main

for improving our assessment of mitigation options. One
source is the inherent unpredictability of future conditions that

forces. These conditions include such things as future trends in
fossil fuel usage and the degree to which various mitigation
strategies will be implemented—decisions that hinge on fac-
tors such as economic conditions, environmental awareness,
and political will. The most effective way of dealing with these
uncertainties is by developing analytical tools that can incor-

"No-till agriculture that increases C storage in the soil
is one example of a GHG-mitigating practice that
meets the criteria for successful, unforced adaption.
No-till practices are used increasingly in the United
States in the production of corn, soybeans, and wheat.
No-till accounted for about 10-14% of the total
acreage of these crops in 1992, double what it had
been 5 years earlier.

Nutrient management practices that result in lower N
application rates should reduce emission of N,O. Soil
testing, fertilizer placement, timing, class of fertilizer,
and inhibitors are practices that supply nutrients in
better accordance with plant physiologic demands.
These practices are more likely to be economically
feasible on crops that have high N demands (e.g.,
corm, cotton, and wheat). Because these practices
already are being adopted to some extent, only mini-
mal institutional programs may be needed to signifi-
cantly increase their level of use.

Reducing the number of days that rice fields are
flooded will require large land and water resource
investments to provide supplemental storage to
change time of flooding. Economic feasibility will be
dependent on many unique characteristics of the pro-
ject site. Such cost estimates will need to address
financing and repayment of any structural develop-
ments and how such developments change hydrology
of water systems and impact other users, in addition to
adoption costs incurred by individual producers. As
there are no obvious on-farm benefits, and there are
adoption costs for this practice, institutional interven-
tion to provide economic incentives or a mandate
requiring the practices will likely be needed.

n the need for compiling and analyzing baseline information:

Carbon Sequestration in Agricultural Systems—
The assessment of potentials to increase C stocks in
agricultural systems could be improved by using a
structured, model-based analysis with global cover-
age. Suitable models for such a task currently exist and
have been used for regional-level analyses (see
Section 23.2.2.3). The elements that are lacking are:
(1) spatial databases linking climate, soils, and land
use and management, which are needed as model
inputs; and (2) reliable experimental data to calibrate
and/or verify model predictions. A compilation of agri-
cultural land-use information to develop a classifica-
tion and mapping of agroecological/management
zones for the world is sorely needed. Existing long-
term agricultural experiments can provide information
to evaluate model predictions for different manage-
ment systems, and soil and climate conditions. Efforts
are underway to establish networks of long-term
experiment sites and data (Paul et al., 1995, Powlson
et al., 1995), but they are still at an early stage.
Bioenergy Production from Agricultural Lands—
Research needed to improve assessments of CO, mit-
igation potential through increased use of biofuels
includes better technical knowledge of biofuel pro-
duction and energy conversion efficiencies, as well as
information on socioeconomic factors affecting the
utilization of biofuels. These needs include: (1)
improved information on the actual C feedstock value
of forest, agroforestry, and agricultural management
systems; (2) better data on energy inputs for the pro-
duction of wooden goods and tree-derived chemicals
and their substitutes; (3) better data on land availabil-
ity, including cultural, social, and political factors that
may preclude some lands from use for C offset pro-
jects; and (4) better data, including economic analy-
ses, for the use and efficiency of biofuels, particular-
ly where that usage is conducted outside markets.

CH, and N,O Emissions from Agricultural

Systems—Research needed to improve assessments

of CH, and N,O mitigation options includes improved

synthesis and coordination of existing information
and additional field measurements:

— Available field emission/consumption data need to
be carefully assimilated so that comparisons of data

sets that were collected over an insufficient period
of time, used inadequate methodology, or are from
nonrepresentative systems should be omitted.

"Three categories of promising forestry practices that promote
sustainable management of forests and at the same time con-
serve and sequester carbon (C) are considered in this chapter:
(1) management for conservation of existing C pools in forests
by slowing deforestation, changing harvesting regimes, and
protecting forests from other anthropogenic disturbances; (2)
management for expanding C storage by increasing the area
and/or C density in native forests, plantations, and agroforestry
and/or in wood products; and (3) management for substitution
by increasing the transfer of forest biomass C into products
such as biofuels and long-lived wood products that can be used
instead of fossil-fuel based products. Since the 1992 assess-
ment, significant new information has been developed that
improves estimates of the quantities of C that can be conserved
or sequestered—and the associated implementation costs of
forest sector mitigation strategies—and better identifies limits
to the amount of lands available for such mitigation strategies.
"	Text
"The most effective long-term (>50 years) ways in
which to use forests to mitigate the increase in atmos-
pheric CO, are to substitute fuelwood for fossil fuels
and for energy-expensive materials. However, over
the next 50 years or so, substantial opportunities exist
to conserve and increase the C store in living trees and
wood products (High Confidence).

Under baseline conditions (today’s climate and no change
in the estimated available lands over the period of inter-
est), the cumulative amount of C that could potentially be
conserved and sequestered over the period 1995-2050 by
slowing deforestation (138 Mha) and promoting natural
forest regeneration (217 Mha) in the tropics, combined
with the implementation of a global forestation program.
(345 Mha of plantations and agroforestry), would be
about 60 to 87 Gt—equivalent to 12-15% of the project-
ed (IPCC 1992a scenario) cumulative fossil fuel C emis-
sions over the same period (Medium Confidence).

The annual C gain from the above program would
reach about 2.2 Gt/yr by 2050, or about four times the
value of 0.5 Gt C/yr estimated in the 1992 assessment.
The gradual increase over time occurs because of the
time it takes for programs to be implemented and the
relatively slow rate at which C accumulates in forest
systems (Medium Confidence).

Uncertainty associated with the C conservation and
sequestration estimates is caused mainly by high
uncertainty in estimating land availability for foresta-
tion and regeneration programs and the rate at which
tropical deforestation can actually be reduced; esti-
mates of the net amount of C per unit area conserved
"	List
"or sequestered under a particular management scheme
are more certain (High Confidence).

The tropics have the potential to conserve and
sequester the largest quantity of C—45-72 Gt—more
than half of which would be due to promoting natural
forest regeneration and slowing deforestation. Tropical
America has the largest potential for C conservation
and sequestration (46% of the tropical total), followed
by tropical Asia (34%) and tropical Africa (20%). The
temperate and boreal zones could sequester about 13 Gt
and 2.4 Gt, respectively—mainly in the United States,
temperate Asia, the former Soviet Union (FSU), China,
and New Zealand (Medium Confidence).

The cumulative cost—excluding land costs and other
transaction costs—to conserve and sequester the above
amounts of C range from US$247 billion to $302 billion at
a unit cost of about $2-8/t C. These unit costs are consid-
erably lower than those in the 1992 assessment, which
ranged from $8/t C in tropical latitudes to $28 in non-U.S.
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) countries. Transaction costs may significantly
increase these estimated costs (Low Confidence).

Costs per unit of C sequestered or conserved general-
ly increase from low- to high-latitude nations (High
Confidence) and from slowing deforestation and pro-
moting regeneration to establishing plantations (Low
Confidence). The latter trend may not hold if trans-
action costs of slowing deforestation are excessive.
These cost estimates, although benefitting from improved
data and methodology since the first assessment, general-
ly represent only the cost of direct forest practices. These
costs could be several times higher if land and opportuni-
ty costs and/or the costs of establishing infrastructure,
protective fencing, training programs, and tree nurseries
were included; on the other hand, costs could be offset by
revenues from timber and non-timber products. No com-
plete cost estimates are available (Medium Confidence).
Under conditions of climate and land-use change as pro-
jected by the IMAGE 2.0 model (“conventional wis-
dom” scenario, akin to the IPCC 1992a scenario), the
carbon conservation and sequestration potential may be
somewhat less than estimated under baseline conditions
because less land may be available in the tropics, unless
land was secured for mitigation measures or sustainable
agriculture/agroforestry systems were widely adopted,
and sequestration by new forests in temperate and bore-
al regions may be offset by transient decline and the loss
of carbon from existing forests in response to climate

"Forests cover about 4.1 Gha of the Earth (Dixon et al.,
1994a, with revisions based on Kolchugina and Vinson,
1995). Modst of the forests are in the low latitudes (43%),
followed by the high latitudes (32%) and mid-latitudes
(25%). Forest plantations are currently estimated to occupy
about 0.1 Gha of land. Although the technology for manag-
ing forests is well developed, today only about 11% of the
world’s forests are managed for goods and services (World
Resources Institute, 1990; Winjum et a/., 1992a), The
extent of management, however, varies by region: About
20% of the mid-latitude forests, 17% of the high-latitude
forests, and less than 4% of the low-latitude forests are man-
aged. In addition, large areas of land technically suitable for
forests are degraded or are otherwise underproducing
because of human misuse (Winjum et al., 1992a). Even

"The key parameters in any assessment of mitigation strategies
are the amount of C per unit area of land that can be conserved
or sequestered in vegetation and soil under given site conditions
and a given management option; the time period over which this
C can be conserved or sequestered; the amount of suitable and
available land; the mitigation costs; and the different lifetimes
of the end wood products. Literature data and discussions on
these factors are presented in this chapter, although large uncer-
tainties exist in some data (Houghton ef al., 1993; Iverson et al.,
1993; Trexler and Haugen, 1995), Estimates of the mitigation
potential and costs of the various options are generated from lit-
-erature sources. Because no studies to date have addressed the
mitigation potential of forests under a changed climate and
atmosphere, the mitigation potential could be assessed only
under a baseline condition, with no effects of climate change or
increased atmospheric CO,. More briefly, the effects of a
changed climate, atmospheric composition, demographics, and
land use on the mitigation potential are considered based on
interpretation of trends from a global integrated assessment
model (Alcamo, 1994). A discussion of new research directions

"Forest ecosystems merit consideration in biogenic mitigation
strategies because they can be both sources and sinks of CO),
the most abundant greenhouse gas (GHG). Currently the
world’s forests are estimated to be a net C source, primarily
because of deforestation and forest degradation in the tropics.
Temperate and boreal forests are a C sink because many are
recovering from past natural and human disturbances, and they
are actively managed (Dixon et al., 1994a). However, there is
the potential to lessen projected C emissions by protecting and
conserving the C pools in existing forests; to create C sinks by
expanding C storage capacities, by increasing the area and/or
C density of native forests, plantations, and agroforests, and by
increasing the total pool of wood products; and to substitute
fossil fuels with fuelwood from sustainably managed forests,
short-lived wood products with long-lived wood products, and
energy-expensive materials with wood (Grainger, 1988; Dixon
et al., 1991; IPCC, 1992; Winjum et al., 1992a, 1992b; Nilsson
and Schopfhauser, 1995; Trexler and Haugen, 1995). This
chapter reviews the potential magnitude of forest-based CO,
stabilization options based on various assessments in recent
years; the costs to implement such programs; and the effects of
a changed climate, atmospheric composition, and. human
demographics on the potential amount of C conserved and
sequestered, The chapter also suggests how to devise improved
assessments to formulate practical strategies.

poorly known, such as the C pool in woody detritus and slash

in the estimated total C pool. Most of the C pool in vegeta-

most of the soil C pool is located in high-latitude forests
(52%). Country-level analyses demonstrate that forests
already play an important role in the C budget of some coun-

"The status and areas of forests change, even in the absence of
human interference. However, humans influence the pace and
extent of change as forests are subjected to controlled and
uncontrolled uses (overharvesting and degradation); large-
scale occurrence of wildfire; fire control; pest and disease out-
breaks; and conversion to non-forest use, particularly agricul-
ture and pastures. At the same time, some areas of harvested
and degraded forests or agricultural and pasture lands are aban-
doned and revert naturally or are converted to forests or plan-
tations. In high latitudes, the area of forests is undergoing lit-
tle change (Kolchugina and Vinson, 1995). In mid-latitudes,
there is a net gain of about 0.7 Mha/yr of forests, mostly in
Europe and China (Dixon et al., 1994a). Furthermore, many of
the forests in high and mid-latitudes have been harvested (clear
cut or selective cut) in the far to near past and are now gener-
ally in a stage of regeneration and regrowth (Apps and Kurz,
1991; Birdsey, 1992; Heath et al., 1993; Kauppi et ail., 1992,

"Low-latitude forests are experiencing high rates of loss—
currently estimated to be about 15.4 Mha/yr during 1980-90,
but with large uncertainties (FAO, 1993). Much of the defor-
ested area is converted to new agricultural or pasture lands,
which often replace degraded agricultural lands that may or
may not be capable of supporting tree cover (Brown, 1993;
Dale et al., 1993). However, in a few tropical countries,
deforestation has decreased during the last decade [e.g.,
India (Ravindranath and Hall, 1994; see also Section
24,3.1.1), Brazil (Skole and Tucker, 1993), and Thailand
(Dixon et al., 1994a)]. In addition to deforestation, large
areas of forests are harvested and degraded. For example,
about 5.9 Mha/yr of low-latitude forests were logged during
1986-90, and most logging occurred in mature forests (83%)
rather than secondary forests (FAO, 1993). These harvested
forests can regenerate and accumulate C if they are protect-
ed or are relatively inaccessible to human populations, but
many of them become degraded (e.g., Lanly, 1982; Brown et
al., 1993b, 1994). Forest degradation, resulting in a loss of
biomass C, occurs through damage to residual trees and soil
from poor logging practices, log poaching, fuelwood collec-
tion, overgrazing, and anthropogenic fire (Goldammer, 1990,
1993; Brown ef al., 1991, 1993b; FAO, 1993; Flint and
Richards, 1994). Similar anthropogenic disturbances most
likely have occurred and are still occurring in other forest
regions of the world. This means that few forested areas in
the world are presently undisturbed by humans; this fact has
implications for their present role in the global C cycle and
future C sequestration potentials (Lugo and Brown, 1986,
1992; Brown et al., 1992; Wood, 1993).

forests—where estimated C fluxes are based, for the most part,
on data from periodic national inventories (i.e., field measure-
ments)—the estimated C flux for low-latitude forests is based
on a model that tracks only forests that are cleared or harvest-
ed with regrowth. In the model, C accumulates in regrowing
forests for up to 50-100 years. Furthermore, the model
assumes that all other forests not reportedly affected by
humans during the period of mode! simulation (about
1850-1990) are in C steady state (Houghton et al., 1987).
Recent work questions this steady-state assumption and
implies that the net tropical C flux could be higher or lower
than that reported here, depending upon the relative contribu-
tion of forest lands that are still gaining C through recovery
from past human disturbances or are losing C through contin-
ued human use (Brown et al., 1992; Lugo and Brown, 1992).
"	Text
"Some countries that signed the Framework Convention on Climate Change have made detailed calculations of the
amounts of C currently being sequestered by their forests, taking into account the historic rates of forest planting and har-
vesting, and the dynamics of forest growth and the flow of C to litter and forest product pools (see Table 24-2 for a sam-
pling). In Britain, New Zealand, and India, C is being sequestered as a result of recent forestation programs—whereas in
Finland, C is being sequestered by natural regeneration and regrowth of forests because the annual growth is greater than
the annual harvest. In Canada, carbon sequestration is occurring as a result of recovery from previous fires. In 17 West
European countries, forestry offsets from 1-2% (The Netherlands, Britain, Germany) to about 90% (Sweden) of fossil
fuel emissions (Burschel et al., 1993; Kauppi and Tomppo, 1993).

"Mid- and high-latitude forests are currently estimated to be a
net C sink of about 0.7 + 0.2 Gt/yr because forests at these lat-
itudes are, on average, composed of relatively young classes
with higher rates of net production as they recover from past
disturbances such as abandonment of agricultural land, har-
vesting, and wildfires; a larger proportion of these forests are
actively managed (i.e., established, tended, and protected); and
some areas may be responding to increased levels of atmos-
pheric CO, and nitrogen (N) (fertilization effect) (Apps and
Kurz, 1991; Birdsey, 1992; Kauppi et al., 1992, 1995; Xu,
1992; Heath et al., 1993; Kolchugina and Vinson, 1993, 1995;
Kurz and Apps, 1993; Turner et al., 1995a). Because sec-
ondary forests in the mid-and high latitudes are rebuilding C
pools, there is a finite potential over which this C sequestration
can occur. For example, the current C sink in European forests
may disappear within 50 to 100 years (Kauppi et al., 1992),
although others suggest that it may take forests as long as sev-
eral centuries to millennia to reach a C steady state in all com-
ponents (Lugo and Brown, 1986).

"also occur in tropical moist and dry forests; these also are
largely of anthropogenic origin (Goldammer, 1990). Factors
contributing to increased wildfires in tropical moist forests are
the drying of organic materials (fuel) on the forest floor of
degraded forests (increased exposure to solar radiation) and
changes in the microclimate of forest remnants surrounded by
deforested areas (Fearnside, 1990; Kaufman and Uhl, 1990).
Significant areas of temperate and boreal forest also are burned
by wildfires of natural or anthropogenic origin or prescribed
(controlled) fires (Levine, 1991; Auclair and Carter, 1993;
Dixon and Krankina, 1993).

"Many boreal forests grow on peat or organic soils that contain
very large amounts of C. Undisturbed anaerobic, northern
peatlands are sinks for CO, and sources of CH, (Matthews and
Fung, 1987; see Chapter 6). Drainage of these soils to improve
forest productivity virtually stops CH, emissions but initiates
rapid CO, loss by aerobic decomposition. Draining peat soils
for forest establishment can produce a C loss from these soils
that exceeds C stored in the forest if 20-30 cm of peat decom-
pose as a result of the drainage (Cannell et al., 1993). There
also are vast areas of forested peatlands in the tropics; how
they will be affected by drainage is largely unknown (see
Chapter 6).

"In addition to managing forest vegetation to conserve or
sequester C, there also is an opportunity to manage forest soils
for the same purposes (Johnson, 1992; Lugo and Brown, 1993;
Dixon et al., 1994a). Regional and national programs to con-
serve soil, including organic matter, have been implemented
worldwide (Dixon et al., 1994a). Management practices to
maintain, restore, and enlarge forest soil C pools include (after
Johnson, 1992) enhancement of soil fertility; concentration of
agriculture and reduction of slash-and-burn practices; preser-
vation of wetlands; minimization of site disturbance during
harvest operations to retain organic matter; forestation of
degraded and nondegraded sites; and any practice that reduces
soil aeration, heating, and drying. Several long-term experi-
ments demonstrate that C can accrete in the soil at rates of 0.5
to 2.0 thha/yr (Dixon et al., 1994a).

"The destruction of forest biomass by burning releases, in addi-
tion to CO,, GHGs that are byproducts of incomplete com-
bustion—namely, methane (CH,), carbon monoxide (CO),
nitrous oxide (N,O), and nitrogen oxide (NO,), among others.
Whereas complex accounting models and forest inventories
are needed to estimate the losses and gains of C over different
timescales, the emissions of these other gases from biomass
burning are instantaneous, absolute transfers from the bios-
phere to the atmosphere (Crutzen et al., 1979; Crutzen and
Andreae, 1990). Globally, biomass burning contributes about
10% of total annual CH, emission, 10-20% of total annual
N,0O emission, and about half of the CO emission—and so has
a significant effect on atmospheric chemistry, especially on
tropospheric ozone levels (Houghton et ai., 1992). Biomass
burning also transfers a fraction (up to 10%) of the C to an
inert form (charcoal) with a turnover time that is practically
infinite.

"Substitution of the net C flux for forests reported here (Table
24-1) into the global C budget (Schimel et al., 1995) results in
an imbalance of 1.2 + 1.0 Gt/yr. Because the primary data for
C budgets for temperate and boreal countries originate from
national forest inventories, any increased growth of forests
due to CO, and N fertilization and climatic effects is already
included in the net flux estimates. In other words, the report-
ed C sink for mid- to high-latitude forests (Table 24-1)
includes all these factors already because the data, for the
most part, come from repeated forest inventories. In contrast,
the tropical forest C flux is based on a model and not on
repeated forest inventories. Furthermore, the model does not
include effects of CO, and N fertilization and climate. This
leads to the conclusion that a large part of the imbalance in the
global C budget must be due to a C sink in tropical latitudes,
which also has been suggested by others (Lugo and Brown,
1992; Taylor and Lloyd, 1992; Schimel et al., 1995). This
could be due to a combination of stimulated regrowth from
CO, and N fertilization and climate, as well as more extensive
forest regrowth. It is clear that to resolve this issue, repeated
national forest inventories, with permanent plots, are needed
in tropical latitudes.

"The global average net C flux and uncertainty term from the
world’s forests reported here of -0.9 + 0.5 Gt/yr (a net C
source; Table 24-1) is less than that reported in Schimel et al.
(1995) of -1,1 + 1.1 Gt/yr. The main reason for this difference
-is in the interpretation and use of results from the literature. A
major difference exists between the respective estimates used
for the C flux of boreal forests, particularly for the FSU. In this
chapter (Table 24-1), the studies of Kolchugina and Vinson
(1993, 1995) were used, which include a complete forest-sec-
tor C budget and use more current data; Schimel et al. (1995)
relied more on the work by Melillo et al. (1988) and Krankina
and Dixon (1994), These two latter studies were not used in
arriving at the estimate in Table 24-1 for the mean C flux for
boreal forests because the Melillo et al. (1988) results were for
an earlier period (prior to 1980) and the Krankina and Dixon
(1994) study did not consider all components of the C budget.
The main source of difference in the uncertainty term is the
error assigned to the tropical net flux: We report an uncertain-
ty term around the tropical flux of + 0.4 Gt/yr based on
Houghton (1995), whereas Schimel et al. (1995) report a term
of + 1.0 Gt/yr based on an assumption that the uncertainty was
greater than 50% for reasons given above. However, as dis-
cussed above, none of these uncertainty terms may reflect the
true precision of the estimates.

"Although reducing deforestation in the tropics may appear to be
a difficult task, there are countries where this is happening (e.g.,
Brazil, India, Thailand). An example of note is India, where net
deforestation has been reduced significantly. Despite its high
population density and growth rate, India has succeeded in sta-
bilizing the area under forest during the last decade at about 64
Mha, about 19% of its land area (Ravindranath and Hall, 1994).
This stabilization does not mean deforestation of native forests
has ceased but rather that loss of native forests is balanced by
establishment of plantations (see Chapter 15). This has been
achieved by strong forest conservation legislation, a large
forestation program, and community awareness.

"The goal of conservation management is mainly to conserve
existing C pools in forests as much as possible through options
such as controlling deforestation, protecting forests in reserves,
changing harvesting regimes, and controlling other anthro-
pogenic disturbances such as fire and pest outbreaks. The goal
of storage management is to expand the storage of C in forest
ecosystems by increasing the area and/or C density of natural
and plantation forests and increasing storage in durable wood
products. Substitution management aims at increasing the trans-
fer of forest biomass C into products (e.g., construction materi-
als and biofuels) that can replace fossil-fuel-based energy and
products, cement-based products, and other building materials.

"Past international efforts to curb deforestation, such as the
Tropical Forestry Action Plan, have met with limited success
(Trexler and Haugen, 1995). Major factors are the absence of
comprehensive agricultural policies that meet the needs of
resource-poor farmers and the growing global demand for
food, fiber, and fuel for the increasing human population
(Brown, 1993; Grainger, 1993). Deforestation has been
viewed as largely a forestry and conservation problem, and
tackling the symptoms rather than the root causes is an incom-
plete strategy. Global action to mitigate emissions of C by con-
serving C pools may lead to more interest and success in con-
trolling deforestation and making agriculture more sustainable.

"Reducing tropical deforestation and forest degradation rates
would require action to reduce the pressures for land and com-

deforestation and degradation is caused by the expansion and
degradation of arable and grazing lands and subsistence and
commodity demand for wood products—which in turn are a
response to the underlying pressures of population growth,
socioeconomic development, and political forces. Thus, pro-
grams to reduce deforestation must be accompanied by mea-
sures that increase agricultural productivity and sustainability,
as well as initiatives to slow the rate of population growth
(Grainger, 1990; Waggoner, 1994; see also Chapters 13, 15,

"It should be emphasized at the outset that the objective of the
practices presented here—that is, to foster C conservation and
sequestration in forests—is but one of a variety of objectives
for forest management that needs to be balanced with other
objectives. However, most forest-sector actions that promote
C conservation and sequestration make good social, economic,
and ecological sense even in the absence of climate-change
considerations. Other objectives for managing forests include
sustainable development, industrial wood and fuel production,
traditional forest uses, protection of natural resources (e.g.,
biodiversity, water, and soil), recreation, rehabilitation of dam-
aged lands, and the like; C conservation and sequestration
resulting from managing for these objectives will be an added
benefit. For example, although the primary reasons for the
establishment of plantations on non-forested land have been
economic development, provision of new wood resources (e.g.,
Portugal, Swaziland), replacement of diminishing or less-pro-
ductive natural forests (e.g., Australia, Brazil, Malaysia),
import substitution (e.g., United Kingdom, Zimbabwe), gener-
ation of export income (e.g., Chile, New Zealand), or rehabili-
tation projects (Evans, 1990; Kanowski and Savill, 1992;

when they are established on highly degraded lands and are
subject to no further management (Lugo et al,. 1993; Parrotta,

Tropical Timber Agreement (agreed to in January 1994). It
also is likely that a trend toward management for sustainable
timber production in all of the world’s forests will occur in the
future. Using forests for sustainable timber production—
including extending rotation cycles, reducing waste, imple-
menting soil conservation practices, and using wood in a more
C-efficient way—ensures that a large fraction of forest C is
conserved. Paper recycling is another strategy with the poten-
tial to reduce harvest levels and promote greater C conserva-
tion (Turner et al., 1995b).

"Storage management means increasing the amount of C stored
in vegetation (living, above and belowground biomass), soil
(litter, dead wood, mineral soil, and peat where important), and
durable wood products. Increasing the C pool in vegetation and
soil can be accomplished by protecting secondary forests and
other degraded forests whose biomass and soil C densities are
less than their maximum value and allowing them to sequester
C by natural or artificial regeneration and soil enrichment.
Other approaches are to establish plantations on non-forested
lands; promote natural or assisted regeneration in secondary
forests, followed by protection; or increase tree cover on agri-
cultural or pasture lands (agroforestry) for environmental pro-
tection and local needs. The C pool in durable wood products
can be increased by expanding demand for wood products at a
faster rate than the decay of wood and by extending the lifetime
of wood products. These measures include timber treatment and
the production of long-lasting particle boards (Elliott, 1985).

"Substitution management, which has the greatest mitigation
potential in the long term (>50 years) (Marland and Marland,
1992; Swisher, 1995), views forests as renewable resources. It
focuses on the rate of C sequestration or the transfer of biomass
C into products that substitute for or lessen the use of fossil fuels,
rather than on increasing the C pool itself (Grainger, 1990;
Mixon et al., 1994). This approach involves extending the use
of forests for wood products and fuels obtained either by estab-
lishing new forests or plantations or by increasing the growth of
existing forests through silvicultural treatments (Table 24-3).
However, a consideration of growth rates and initial standing
stocks of biomass C is critical in determining which existing
forests should be used for this purpose (Marland and Marland,
1992). For example, it is better not to convert forests with a
large initial standing biomass C and slow growth rates (e.g., old-
growth forests) to managed stands because it may take a very
long time (up to centuries) until the net C sequestered retums to
its initial value (Harmon et al., 1990; Marland and Marland,
1992)—or never, if they are harvested on a rotational basis
(Dewar, 1991; Vitousek, 1991; Dewar and Cannell, 1992;
Cannell, 1995). In contrast, forests with high growth rates and
low-to-medium initial biomass C standing stocks are amenable
for conversion to managed forests, with considerable quantities
of C sequestered if the harvested wood is directly used (Marland
and Marland, 1992). When presented with cleared or disturbed
forest lands, any forest management practice that increases the C
pools and cycles the C by harvesting wood for substitution of
energy-intensive products or fossil fuels will remove CO, from
the atmosphere on a continuing basis.

"The potential land area available for the implementation of for-
est management options for C conservation and sequestration
is a function of the technical suitability of the land to grow
trees and the actual availability as constrained by socioeco-
nomic factors. Determining the technical suitability of land is
conceptually less difficult, being based generally on the
region’s climatic and edaphic characteristics. However, mov-
ing from what is suitable to what is actually available is more
difficult because of institutional, economic, demographic, and
cultural factors—all of which influence present and future
land-use decisions (Trexler and Haugen, 1995).
"	Text
"When forests are used to produce sawtimber, plywood, or other
industrial wood products, C can be sequestered for long peri-
ods. The length of time depends on how the timber is treated
and used. The production of wood products often requires
much less energy than does production of alternative products
like steel, aluminum, and concrete, and there can be a large
energy return on investment in wood products. For example,
the substitution of composite solid-wood products with load-
bearing capacities for steel and concrete can save large
amounts of fossil fuels. However, an analysis of the full life
cycles of wood products is required to appreciate the impact on
net C storage and net C emissions. Over long time periods, the
displacement of fossil fuels either directly or through produc-
tion of low-energy-intensive wood products is likely to be
more effective in reducing C emissions than physical storage
of C in forests or forest products. For example, substitution of
wood grown in plantations for coal in the generation of elec- -
tricity can avoid C emissions by an amount up to four times the
amount of C sequestered in the plantation, depending upon the
time period over which coal resources are expected to last

of land available for reforestation and natural and assisted regen-

be sequestered in the entire high-latitude zone over a 50-year
period. In Russia alone, Krankina and Dixon (1994) estimate a
potential sequestration of 4.5 Gt C over a 50-year period by
replacing hardwood stands with conifers, increasing the produc-

cally suitable lands. Furthermore, they estimate that exercising

grams (345 Mha for plantations and agroforestry, 138 Mha for

estimate current and projected future deforestation rates, the
potential reduction in deforestation based on feasible imple-

able for natural or assisted forest regeneration (native forests)
followed by protection, as well as likely rates of implementa-

only 20% of the business-as-usual scenario—equivalent to
about 138 Mha—and a further 217 Mha of land will be avail-

in tropical forests; there is considerable debate about how much
biomass C tropical forests contain (Brown and Lugo, 1992). The
net amount of C per unit area that can be sequestered in a glob-

"The cooperative venture between Innoprise Corporation Sdn Bhd (ICSB), the largest logging concession holder
in the state of Sabah, Malaysia, and the Forest Absorbing Carbon Dioxide Emissions (FACE) Foundation pro-
motes the planting of trees to absorb CO, from the atmosphere and offset emissions from power stations. The
objective is to rehabilitate 25,000 ha of degraded logged forests by enrichment planting with dipterocarps—
long-lived local tree species valued for their timber—and by reclaiming degraded areas using indigenous fast-
growing pioneer trees. Forest fruit trees also are being interplanted to improve the forest’s value for wildlife.
Over a 60-year rotation, the rehabilitated forest is expected to sequester at least 200 t C/ha more than degraded
logged forest; thus, a total of 5 Mt C will be sequestered. Results achieved so far are very encouraging, with
survival rates around 87% and growth rates of 1.2 cm dbh per year (P. Moura Costa, pers. comm.). The long-
term nature of the project (25 years) will allow the maintenance and silvicultural treatments required to sustain
the growth rates to be achieved.

For the Reduced-Impact Logging Project, New England Power (NEP) provided funds to ICSB to train person-
nel and implement a set of harvesting guidelines in 1,400 ha of ICSB concessions. In return, NEP can claim the
C retained due to these efforts as a C offset. The project aims to reduce by half the damage to residual trees and
soil during timber harvesting. Thus, less woody debris will be produced, decompose, and release CO,, meaning
more C will be retained on-site in living trees (Putz and Pinard, 1993). Conventional selective logging in the
concession provides the base for comparison. Controlling logging damage is expected to result in the retention
of 25-45 t C/ha after 2 years, and a total of 35-63 kt C are expected to be sequestered, at a cost of $8—-14/t C. .

"Subsequent to the IPCC report (1992), several studies have
been done that better determine the cost of expanding C pools

focused on deriving cost estimates of mitigation options for
individual countries. The costs generally include initial or
establishment costs per ton of C but do not include opportunity
costs or maintenance, monitoring, and evaluation costs. The
methods for obtaining cost figures include literature surveys,
government sources, personal questionnaires, and some field
data. At the same time, researchers have refined the methodol-
ogy for estimating the amount of C sequestered by a particular
mitigation option and better identified the individual compo-

"Earlier studies had reported point estimates for cost of C seques-
tration. Moulton and Richards (1990), however, developed a cost
function to reflect the rise in costs associated with large-scale tree
planting rather than a simple point estimate, and refined the tree
plantation establishment cost estimates by differentiating costs
associated with location and site considerations. Based on their
data, Cline (1992) estimates costs as rising from $12/t C for the
first 100 Mt of C sequestered to $41/ C for sequestering between
700 and 800 Mt/yr. Adams ef al. (1993) report somewhat higher
costs than Moulton and Richards (1990) (Table 24-8). The
Moulton and Richards (1990) analysis has been expanded by
adding the potential effects of forestation on altered timber sup-
ply, stumpage prices, harvest levels, and ultimately C sequestra-
tion (Turner et al., 1995b). The latter approach couples a forest
economics model, a forest inventory model, and a forest C model
to make a 50-year projection of the forest sector of the U.S. econ-
omy. Coupling of models permits analysis of more-complex mit-
igation options such as increased paper recycling, alternative har-
vesting schemes, and tree planting on agricultural land. One
drawback of these models is that they ignore new uses of wood—
such as for power or heat generation—that would minimize the
impact on traditional timber markets.

efits derived from timber and non-timber forest products. The
commercial value of these products will vary with the site and
location of a project—particularly in tropical countries, where
non-timber forest products provide sustenance to the local
dwellers. Additional indirect benefits (nature conservation,
recreation, etc.) will add to a project’s value. Appropriate dis-

"Winjum and Lewis (1993) demonstrate the significance of
including the opportunity cost of the forest stock. Using the
value of growing stock and revenues (i.e., negative costs), they
show that without including growing stock costs, the median
values (negative costs) of storing C are -$48/t C for temperate
and -$32/t C for tropical plantations. With the growing stock
costs included, the median values of storing C increase to -$22
and -$24/t C, respectively. Inclusion of the opportunity cost of
land and of forest stock therefore may increase the cost in
developed countries two to threefold, but the increase may be
smaller in developing countries where degraded lands are
available.

"The distribution of benefits plays an important role in assuring the
success of either large forestation programs or individual projects.
Adams et al. (1993) illustrate that a U.S. forestation program to
sequester C on agricultural land will bestow higher benefits to agri-
cultural producers and landowners from higher commodity prices,
but the decline in timber prices will reduce timbet-sale profits for
private forest owners. If the distribution of benefits is to be equi-
table, the government will have to compensate private commercial
tree planting to prevent farmers from displacing present tree plan-
tations. For example, Saxena (1989) has shown that the losers in a
rural forestry development program in India will be the local forest
officers, whereas both the rural rich and the poor will gain to vary-
ing degrees from non-timber benefits and timber sales.

"The studies summarized in Table 24-8 ignore another poten-
tially large C benefit—that is, the possibility of substituting
wood from sustainable plantations for fossil fuels (see Section
24.3.3; Hall et al., 1991; Sampson et al., 1993; see also
Chapter 19). The extent to which wood products can displace
fossil fuel depends on the products and applications for which
wood is substituted. Fossil fuel savings may be considerable
when wood is substituted for energy-intensive aluminum, steel,
or concrete in construction (Burschel et al., 1993). When har-
vesting wood to directly displace fossil fuels, the critical ele-
ments become the rate of tree productivity and the efficiency
with which wood can be harvested and substituted for fossil
fuels (Marland and Marland, 1992; see also Section 24.3.3).

"Monetary timber benefits alone often can more than offset the
project costs (Winjum and Lewis, 1993). The cost offset varies
depending on inclusion of indirect benefits, such as forest stock
value. Other estimates of the benefit of C sequestration for devel-
oping countries (Ravindranath and Somashekar, 1995; Roslan
and Woon, 1995; Wangwacharakul and Bowonwiwat, 1995; Xu,
1995) confirm that product revenue from many plantation and
agroforestry projects could completely offset costs. Schroeder
(1992) points out that agroforestry projects could be implement-
ed for C sequestration across many ecological zones and prac-
tices at a positive present value of net benefit ranging from $54/ha
to $6,000/ha, assuming that product prices remain unchanged in
the future. The above estimates suggest that it would be possible
to achieve C sequestration at a net benefit or negative cost.

"The unit cost estimates reported in Table 24-8 include the cost
to initiate a forest sector project—such as planting stock costs,
planting labor, and supervision—but do not include the oppor-
tunity cost of land and growing stock, annual maintenance
costs, and monitoring and evaluation costs. Of these, the latter
two are generally a small fraction of the initial cost. The
opportunity cost of land and growing stock, however, could
significantly increase the unit cost estimates. Land rental costs
are estimated at $148/ha by Moulton and Richards (1990) for
the United States; a land purchase price is estimated between
$400 and $1,000/ha by Sedjo and Solomon (1989). Land
prices are likely to be lower in developing countries. For
example, in Thailand, the present value of the opportunity cost
of land is estimated to be between $44 and $89/ha
(Wangwacharakul and Bowonwiwat, 1995). For degraded
lands that are suitable for reforestation, which are widespread
across many countries, the land price may be close to zero.

diversity and soil productivity (Swanson and Franklin, 1992),
but their C storage benefits have not been well characterized.
Reduction of logging damage to residual trees can also reduce

"Using the mean unit costs for individual options by latitudinal
region (from data in Tables 24-7 and 24-8), the cumulative cost
(undiscounted) of conserving and sequestering the quantity of C

tation only) ranges from $247 billion to $302 billion, at an aver-
age unit cost ranging from $4.6 to $3.7/t C, respectively (Table
24-9). Average unit cost decreases as more C is conserved by
slowing deforestation and forest regeneration because these are
the lowest-cost options. For the forestation program alone, the
unit cost would be $6.4/t C, and the total cost would decrease to
$253 billion. The estimated unit cost in Table 24-9 for the
forestation program is higher than that reported by Nilsson

"Silvicultural practices (thinning, fertilization, improved har-

Increased growth per se does not increase‘mean C storage and,
indeed, may decrease C storage over a given area if the growth
increase is associated with a shift to a younger age-class distri-
bution (Turner et al., 1995b). Many silvicultural practices are
designed to improve some aspect of the wood and/or tree form
and may do little to increase C sequestration, but the longer-
term, indirect effects may have significant C implications. For
example, management techniques that allow greater portions
of the forest to be harvested and converted to long-lived wood
products may sequester a greater mass of C in the long term in
both the forest itself and in the forest product stock.

"The IPCC report (1992) estimates that the forestation costs
(undiscounted) for offsetting between 5 and 26% of the 5.5 Gt
C being released annually from fossil fuel combustion would
range from $2.4 billion/year to $12 billion/year if accomplished
over a 10-year planting period, with declining costs for longer
planting periods. Dixon et al. (1991) report that the marginal
initial cost to sequester global C increases gradually to $10/ C
for a storage level of 70 Gt C, which was about 90% of the iden-
tified storage potential. Beyond 70 Gt C, the marginal cost
increases rapidly. The corresponding total cost to store 70 Gt C
amounts to $230 billion. Country-specific marginal cost esti-

low Jatitudes, human factors such as changing demographics,
increased demand for agricultural land, economic growth,

have the potential to lead to high rates of land-use change—are

may be underestimated by severalfold if additional costs such as
establishing infrastructure, protective fencing, education and
training, and tree nurseries were included. On the other hand, if
timber and other products generate revenue, then the capital
investment for the second and subsequent rotations will be
derived from the revenue from the previous rotation, and the
incremental capital investment will be a fraction of the cost.
Discounting future costs also significantly reduces the total and

"The effects of future climate change on the redistribution of
global forest biomes are uncertain; consequently, there are
large differences in projected changes in forest area for a 2 x
CO, climate (see Chapters 1 and 15). Furthermore, most mod-
els project instantaneous change in potential vegetation distri-
butions only. The development of the IMAGE 2.0 model—
which is one of the first efforts to link submodels of the terres-
trial system, atmosphere-ocean system, and energy-industry
system with geographical specificity—attempts to overcome
some of the problems in projecting changes in distribution of
vegetation (Alcamo, 1994), Output from the “conventional
wisdom” scenario of this model (akin to the IPCC 1992a sce-
nario with respect to projected fossil fuel use; for other aspects
of the model, see Alcamo, 1994, and Chapter 25) has been used
to address the possible impacts of changed land-cover patterns
on C conservation and sequestration potentials. Model output
has been used to provide an estimate of likely changes in land
suitability (i.e., potential vegetation based on the ability to
grow trees, determined by climatic and edaphic factors) and
land availability (a reduction in land suitability based on the
need for land to grow crops, provide fuels, and so forth for the
increasing human population) (see also Chapter 15). The area
of land suitable for forest-sector practices for mitigation could
increase globally, with the larger gains occurring in high and
low latitudes mainly because of warmer temperatures and an
extended growing season (Table 24-10; see also Chapter 1).
However, the potential increase in suitable lands is based on
climatic factors alone and does not consider whether soils will
be suitable for forest establishment. This is potentially prob-
lematic in the high latitudes, where the boreal forests are pro-
jected to migrate into the tundra; tundra soils have characteris-
tics that can retard forest establishment.

"of forest dieback and other disturbances could have major
impacts on the C balance of forests (Smith and Shugart, 1993;
see also Chapter 1). Gains in C sequestration from forestation
programs at mid and high latitudes could be offset in the tran-
sient period by the release of C from unmanaged forests, result-
ing from the processes of migration and regeneration being
slower than dieback and other disturbances. However, dieback
problems in plantation forests are likely to be relatively less
important because these will be managed forests with relative-

King, 1993; Table 24-10). However, in the tropical zone, a con-
sideration of the human element and its impact on forests could
change this risk perspective. Almost all of the increase in suit-
able lands in the high and mid-latitudes has the potential to
become available (Table 24-10). In contrast, gains in land suit-
ability in low latitudes might be unrealized because of the need
for their use for agriculture, and so forth; potentially, half of the
present available lands could be lost (Table 24-10). Based on the
change in land availability alone, the amount of C that can poten-
tially be sequestered in mid and high latitudes would likely
change little, with possible slight gains. The potentially large
decrease in land availability in low latitudes could significantly
reduce the amount of C conserved or sequestered in this region.

"Results from the IMAGE 2.0 model—which incorporates the
effects of CO, fertilization, temperature, and moisture on plant
growth and soil processes—are used as examples of how these
factors may affect C conservation and sequestration rates
(Klein Goldewijk et al., 1994; also see Chapter 25 for more
details on IMAGE 2.0). A discussion of the effects of these
factors on ecosystems also is presented in Chapters 1 and A.
The values in Table 24-11 are derived from the IMAGE 2.0
model to indicate how much the net C flux from forest ecosys-
tems (or net ecosystem production) could change (percent
change from baseline conditions) by 2050; it is assumed that
plantations would respond in the same manner. The percent
changes in this table do not include regions where land-cover
change occurred; they include only those that affect the cycling
of C in regions that were forested in 1970 and still forested in
2050 (referred to as stable forested regions). Differences
between simulations are governed by interactions among land
cover, the biosphere, climate, and CO, concentrations.

less important in the future, mainly due to loss of available

effect on the net C uptake rates of forests and thus rates of C
sequestration due mostly to greater stimulation by increased

"Comprehensive evaluation of possible opportunities for mitiga-

of a complex set of interlocking issues that together determine
feasibility and implementability. Chapters 19 through 24
describe opportunities and challenges for GHG mitigation in six
sectors of natural and socioeconomic systems, providing an
encompassing summary of possible options. An important addi-
tional perspective comes from consideration of issues and
opportunities that cut across the options presented for the indi-
vidual sectors. These cross-cutting issues include whether ener-
gy end-use mitigation options can realistically reduce demands
to levels that can be met by alternate supply systems at low
emissions, whether the many competing pressures for the use
of land can be reconciled, and whether nontraditional “geo-
engineering” offers any plausible options that may be employed
to intentionally counterbalance anthropogenic climatic forcings
and change. This chapter summarizes the limited information
that is available for addressing these questions.

"A wide range of future mitigation options and strategies
involving various uses of land areas has been suggested. The
primary issue in evaluating these options is whether the world
can continue to support an increasing population with its grow-
ing needs for food and fiber and, at the same time, expand the
amount of land used for production of biomass for energy.
Analyses of land-use trends and patterns make clear that sub-
stantial land can be made available for biomass energy
resources only if high rates of improvement in agricultural pro-
ductivity continue throughout the world. Alternatively, moder-
ate increases in agricultural productivity, reduced population
growth rates, and reduced emphasis on meat consumption in
the future could provide an adequate global food supply with
reduced requirements for agricultural land. Even making opti-
mistic assumptions, however, there will be regional disloca-
tions and imbalances as demand for food, limitations in agri-
cultural productivity, and increasing populations come into
conflict. Important stresses on land availability for agriculture,
biomass plantations, and other land uses will emerge if popu-
lation growth continues unabated, high-meat dietary prefer-
ences remain stable or increase, the rate of increase in agricul-
tural productivity slows or stops, land degradation continues,
or the development and penetration of new technologies can-
not be extended to developing countries.

"A review of conceptual approaches for counterbalancing
anthropogenic climate change through geoengineering indicates
that many options entail important adverse environmental con-

carbon-based fuels. Proposed concepts for geoengineering that
have been examined include, for example, the deployment of
solar radiation reflectors in space and the injection of sulfate
aerosols into the atmosphere to mimic the cooling influence of
volcanic eruptions. Most of these approaches are likely to be
expensive to sustain and/or to have serious, but poorly under-
stood, side effects, making them unattractive as possible miti-
gation options. Projections of the chemical and climatic effects
of implementing such approaches are, for most options, at least
as uncertain as those for future development of technologies

"Comprehensive assessment of different combinations of miti-
gation options can only be carried out in an integrated manner,
considering both the direct and coupled implications of various
choices—including, for example, the resulting changes in the
fluxes of all greenhouse gases at local, regional, and global
scales. The development and testing of capabilities for quanti-
tative analysis, including integrated assessment modeling, are
still in early stages of development. As a consequence, there is,
at present, no single “right approach” to integrating an analysis
across the various issues and disciplines. Models and related
analyses, for example, must make tradeoffs between the level
of sectoral detail they can include and the level of complexity
and data requirements that can be realistically handled. Further,
Integrated Assessment Models ([AMs) are only as good as the
underlying socioeconomic assumptions and the necessary
information on sectoral impacts, adaptation, and mitigation
strategies. Across these issues information is lacking in many
regions, particularly in developing countries. Over the next few
years, the development of adequate databases and the
improvement of analysis and assessment capabilities are essen-

"Mitigation options are measures, methodologies, and technolo-

number of individual sectors, including energy supply, industry,
transportation, human settlements, agriculture, and forestry.
Such a compilation of information on specific measures to abate

igation options. In itself, however, it does not address the
important need to analyze the overall, cross-sectoral potential
for reduction of emissions within a country or region, the ways
in which specific mitigation options interact with other options
and with national or regional goals, and the implications of dif-

"What important cross-sectoral issues arise in efforts
to reduce GHG emissions from the energy sector?

The energy sector is likely to be the major focus of
GHG emissions mitigation in most countries. While
an evaluation of options in individual sectors indi-
cates that there are many opportunities to reduce fos-
sil-fuel carbon emissions substantially below those in
1990 for particular activities or processes, it is not
possible to determine how much total emissions can
be reduced without combining these individual
options into a comprehensive strategy or scenario. In
the aggregate, how much can energy demand be
reduced? What supply-side options can be relied upon
to meet these energy demands? Which combinations
of demand management options and alternative ener-
gy supply systems have the greatest ‘potential for
reducing emissions and meeting other national/
regional goals? Section 25.2 describes the major chal-
lenges and approaches to analyzing mitigation options
in the energy sector.

What specific constraints on land use and availabil-
ity may limit mitigation options focusing on land
management?

A wide range of future mitigation options and strate-
gies have been suggested that involve various uses of
land. The main issue is whether the world can contin-
ue to support an increasing population, with its grow-
ing needs for food and fiber, and, at the same time,
expand the amount of land used for production of bio-
mass for energy—while preserving environmental
resources for other purposes, such as the maintenance
of ecosystems, conservation of biodiversity, regenera-
tion and storage of freshwater, assimilation of wastes,
and so forth. Section 25.3 summarizes the issues and
problems confronting efforts to assess land-use
options and scenarios, including the lack of reliable
global information on current and projected patterns
of land cover and land use.

What ideas for large-scale “cross-sectoral” options
exist for attempting to deliberately counterbalance
potential human-induced climate change?

Suggested approaches to counterbalance anthro-
pogenic climate change through geoengineering
include, for example, the deployment of solar radia-
tion reflectors in space and the injection of sulfate
aerosols into the atmosphere to mimic the cooling
influence of volcanic eruptions. Section 25.4 reviews
what is known about these concepts, pointing out that
based on current information, they appear to be very
costly, very uncertain, and/or have significant side
effects relative to measures to reduce GHG emissions.

Can we assess the overall effectiveness of mitigation
options and strategies?

Comparison and assessment of different sets of miti-
gation options is best carried out in an integrated
manner, considering fluxes of all GHGs at local,
regional, and global scales. Such an assessment also
should include the effects of economic activities and
trade and potential climate-change feedbacks. Section
25.5 provides an overview of the issues that need to
be considered as part of such a comprehensive assess-
ment and includes a brief discussion of integrated
models that are currently being developed.

backdrop of a “no-policy,” baseline scenario. Such disaggre-
gated descriptive frameworks have been used for energy miti-
gation scenario analysis at national and regional levels
(Lazarus et al., 1995). The question thus emerges whether the
range of technology options discussed in the énergy end-use
chapters of the present report can be used to construct energy
demand scenarios in different sectors and regions that can then
be aggregated to global levels. Such an analysis has not been
attempted here, for the following reasons:
"	Text
"The first step in such an assessment is to establish the scope and
overall goal(s) of the mitigation strategy. Considerations include
whether the strategy is to meet particular emission reduction tar-
gets; assess specific technologies or policies; or identify mea-
sures that best integrate with key national and subnational objec-
tives, such as increasing economic growth and self-reliance,
reducing unemployment and social inequalities, or promoting
rural development. Decisionmakers also must determine if they
wish to target carbon dioxide (CO,) only or several GHGs;
which of the candidate options can be feasibly implemented by
the country’s institutional structure; and whether the options
being considered will be available and cost-effective in their
country within the timeframe under consideration.

"Consistency of assumptions: The end-use chapters
in this report review a diverse set of studies on the
mitigation potentials of various technologies and poli-
cies. These studies often are based on limited data
from specific countries or regions and use widely
varying social and economic growth assumptions
{including gross domestic product (GDP), population
growth, prices, productivity, exchange rates, technol-
ogy diffusion, and market regimes]. Aggregating
them or extrapolating their projections to other
regions could produce misleading results.

Accounting for corollary benefits, potential side
effects, and offsetting trends: Sectoral mitigation
strategies operate in a complex societal fabric where
they may influence, or be influenced by, other social
and environmental constraints and, in many cases,
even other mitigation policies. Cleaner and more effi-
cient vehicles, for example, will reduce local pollu-
tion and have beneficial impacts on human health;
many demand-side management measures may also
lower consumer expenditures on energy services.
Such corollary benefits would make these options
more attractive than from a purely GHG mitigation
"	List
"Options for reducing energy-related emissions, therefore, fall
under two broad categories: those that reduce GHG emissions
while providing energy services at projected levels of demand
and those. aimed at reducing energy demand itself in key end-use
sectors. Previous chapters of this report investigate many aspects
of these measures in great detail: Chapters 20 through 22 exam-
ine options to reduce energy use and process-related GHG emis-
sions in the industrial, transportation, and residential/commer-
cial sectors, respectively, and Chapter 19 discusses technologies
to enhance fossil fuel conversion efficiencies and describes Low
Emissions Supply Systems (LESS) to meet future energy
demands. Chapter 28 and its companion appendix contain a
detailed inventory of more than one hundred GHG mitigation
technologies for the energy supply and end-use sectors, provid-
ing information on key parameters such as performance and
environmental characteristics, capital and operating costs, and
infrastructure requirements. Also, while specific mitigation pol-
icy measures and implementation challenges are discussed in the
individual sectoral mitigation chapters, a more generic assess-
ment of decisionmaking under uncertainty, mitigation costs, and
macroeconomic measures can be found in Chapters 2,
Decisionmaking Framework to Address Climate Change,
Chapter 9, A Review of Mitigation Cost Studies, and Chapter 11,
An Assessment of Economic Policy Instruments to Combat the
Enhanced Greenhouse Effect, of the Working Group III volume.

"standpoint. On the other hand, mitigation options also
may have potential side effects. For example, heat
cascading systems that result in better waste-energy
utilization might require establishing industries and
human-settlements in close proximity and therefore
might stress local water resources and possibly aggra-
vate concerns about air, noise, and water pollution. In
addition, the emissions reduction potential of many
mitigation options can be offset by societal and
behavioral trends. Improved household and car effi-
ciency measures, for example, may have some of their
mitigation potential offset by decreasing household
size and car occupancy. This is because while less
energy may be consumed on a per house or per car
basis, more houses and cars will be required for a
given number of people. A technology-based aggre-
gation of mitigation potentials is unlikely to incorpo-
rate many of these interactions, which may play
important roles in determining the feasibility, compet-
itiveness, and achievable mitigation potential of vari-
ous options in a given setting.
"	Text
"First, the end-use demand mitigation chapters indicate that the
range of future sectoral demands is very wide indeed. In the
transportation sector, for example, if small, energy-efficient
cars become fashionable and desirable and if urban traffic con-
gestion and other concerns drive policy leading to greater use
of mass transit, then it might be possible to achieve energy
demands for transport consistent with SA90 through mitigation
options that benefit society even in the absence of climate
change. The same, however, cannot be said in a world in which
incomes rise, personal vehicles proliferate, car occupancies
decline, fossil fuels remain inexpensive, and additional trans-
portation networks are built to meet the growing numbers of
vehicles. Similarly, end-use demands for residential and com-
mercial buildings consistent with the SA90 accelerated policy
case are conceivable if three conditions are met: (1) energy
prices rise over time sufficiently to influence consumer behav-
ior; (2) governments enact strong policies to promote energy
efficiency; and (3) research and development of energy-effi-
cient devices is supported and continues to yield viable new
products. A number of reference energy scenarios with such
variations have been constructed (Alcamo et al., 1995).
"	Text
"Second, unconstrained energy demands are likely to limit the
suite of energy supply options that realistically would be avail-
able to meet these demands at low emissions. This would lower
the flexibility and may increase the vulnerability of the energy
supply system. For example, the LESS projections include a
“high-demand” variant based on demands similar to those in
the median “nonintervention” IS92a scenario (Edmonds et al.,
1994). Conceivably, low-emissions supply systems still could
be developed that meet 1S92a demands for the year 2100 at
annual emissions approximately half of the 1990 levels and
one-fifth of the IS92a emissions projections for 2100.
However, such low-emissions ‘supply systems would need to
rely on a substantial increase in coal production (e.g., coal pro-
duction for LESS “high-demand” constructions for the year
2100 in Chapter 19 is almost five times the 1990 levels) and
require extensive CO, sequestering in aquifers and natural gas
fields—a situation that may not be sustainable as gas fields
become filled to capacity. Besides, other energy sources,
including biomass, are likely to be pushed close to the limits of
their realizable potential to meet high demands. A more flexi-
ble and possibly lower-cost energy future is likely to be one
where energy supply and end-use mitigation options are used
in conjunction to achieve low emissions.
"	Text
"Future demands depend not only on a number of demograph-
ic and socioeconomic factors but also on the extent to which
successful reductions can be achieved from the implementa-
tion of energy conservation and other demand-side manage-
ment schemes. Many energy supply projections already
assume substantial reductions in demand from baseline trends
as a result of these end-use mitigation measures. The demand
projections for the LESS constructions, for example, are
based on a high economic growth, accelerated policy variant
(ie., including GHG mitigation policies) of the SA90 scenar-
ios developed by the IPCC in 1990 (Bernthal, 1990). The
long-term energy demands in this scenario are significantly
less than those projected by IS92a, the median in the “nonin-
tervention” (i.e., assuming no explicit GHG mitigation poli-
cies) scenario-set developed by the IPCC in 1992 (Leggett et
al., 1992). The SA90 scenarios did not consider the range of
technological and societal options considered in the end-use
chapters of the present report. The question thus emerges: Are
the SA90 accelerated policy demands assumed in the con-
struction of the LESS scenarios consistent with reductions
achievable in various end-use sectors? If so, can these
demand reductions be achieved through mitigation measures
that have a net benefit to society, even in the absence of cli-
mate change, or are they likely to be realized only at signifi-
cant cost to society?

fact, targets almost 550 Mha of land for energy cultivation by
the year 2100, This raises a number of concerns, including
whether biomass plantations would conflict with land needed
to meet regional food requirements for increasing populations,
whether biomass cultivation on degraded lands would really
be achievable at productivity levels assumed in the LESS con-

be needed that in turn might stress local water resources. As
Section 25.3 shows, these concerns further complicate the
gamut of issues concerning planning for current and future
uses of land and land cover.
"	Text
"Land use and its changes are heterogeneous, both spatially and
temporally. The global significance of land use arises as a
result of the cumulative effects of local and regional changes in
land cover. These changes are not necessarily land-cover con-
versions. An altered management could change the properties
of land cover (e.g., enhance plant growth through fertilization)
without changing the overall structure or vegetation category
(Turner et al., 1990). The consequences of such modifications
seldom appear in regional and global environmental assess-
ments but are important in altering emissions from land use
(Leemans and Zuidema, 1995). Coarse land-cover patterns
have been used most often to analyze historic and current land-
cover change. These assessments are strongly limited by the
quality of the available land-cover data. Nonetheless, some
insights have emerged.
"	Text
"Many mitigation options depend upon changes in land man-
agement, increasing carbon sequestration potential, and the
use of renewable energy such as biomass (e.g., Chapters 19,
22, and 24). Many mitigation policies in the transportation
sector also require changes in land-use patterns to reduce the
need for goods, transport and travel. All of these mitigation
options involve land, land use, and land cover. In the present
context, “land” refers to the Earth’s surface, including the soil
and its geology and hydrology; the biosphere; and the lowest
layer of the atmosphere. “Land cover” includes only the
upper-soil layers and vegetation, while “land use” refers to the
explicit purpose for which humans exploit land and its vege-
tative cover and consists of a series of activities that alter eco-
logical and physical properties of land (Turner et al., 1993). A
clear distinction between land use and cover is important for
assessing land-related mitigation options because the avail-
ability of land, water, and related commodities is limited, and
different land uses compete with each other.
"	Text
"Research into many aspects of global change requires reliable, geo-referenced information on global land cover for a well-
defined time period (Townshend, 1992). Several classification schemes have been developed to describe land-cover pat-
terns. Schemes have been based on structural (e.g., trees vs. shrubs), physiognomic (e.g., deciduous vs. evergreen), floristic
(e.g., oak-hickory forest), or bioclimatic (e.g., boreal forest) classes, or mixtures thereof. Imprecise terminology, such as
“woodlands,” is often used to label classes. Many classification schemes also include indices that are not directly related to
land cover but to other environmental variables, such as climate (e.g., tropical rainforest). Such deficiencies are not prob-
lematic when a unique classification is applied throughout an analysis, but many global data sets are mixtures from differ-
ent sources, using similar terminology but largely different criteria (Leemans er al., 1995). One of the few globally com-
prehensive classifications is the hierarchical UNESCO classification (1973). This hybrid classification (physiognomic and
structural characteristics at higher levels, species composition at lower levels) was specially developed for the description
of natural vegetation at a climax stage; this is probably one of the reasons that it has never resulted in a global assessment
of land cover. Despite their problems, UNESCO vegetation maps have been produced for several regions (e.g., White,
1983). Since the development of the UNESCO classification, no such generally accepted scheme for land cover has been
developed, although several approaches are emerging, mainly based on technologies involving remote-sensing (Running ef
al., 1994). These approaches have led already to more comprehensive regional estimates of deforestation patterns (e.g.,
Skole and Tucker, 1993) and land-cover classifications (Defries and Townshend, 1994). Several international organiza-
tions, including UNEP and FAO, have recently formulated requirements for adequate land-use and land-cover classifica-
tions (Miicher et al., 1993; UNEP/GEMS, 1993, 1994) and concluded that the implementation of such schemes should be
prioritized in order to assure consistent land-use evaluations (Fresco et al., 1994).

"In spite of these shortcomings, many of these estimates are cited

hence conclusions. Thus, global assessments always must be
concerned with inconsistencies, limitations, and errors in these
data sets. When used with care, these data sets can be used to

"present is likely that of FAO (1991), which gives 1450 Mha.
Unfortunately, however, all of these estimates are only gross
approximations. There are no accurate figures for many coun-
tries; much of the information is based on averages or ill-
defined categories; and the global compilations are generated
from a multitude of sources (Buringh and Dudal, 1987; Defries
and Townshend, 1994; Leemans et al., 1995). One of the major
limitations is that spatial patterns are often not well-depicted.
Linkages between land-cover and other geo-referenced data-
bases—such as climate, topography, and soils—could assist in
removing some of the inconsistencies of the existing land-cover
databases (Loveland et al., 1991; Running et al., 1994).
Improvements in these linkages are a critical constraint in the
use of land-cover data in mitigation assessments.

"Several data sets of global land cover have been compiled. Most
of these data banks are based on simple land-cover classifica-
tion schemes, generally having between five and fifty classes
worldwide (see Box 25-1). Despite their relative simplicity, sig-
nificant differences exist among the different global land-cover
databases. Figure 25-1 presents an aggregation of the different
land-cover classes in each database into broad, but comparable,
classes. These databases are derived from statistical sources,
national maps, and/or other sources, such as climate atlases.
This has led to the large variation in total extent of each class
(Figure 25-1). The most apparent difference between these data-
bases is for cultivated lands, for which estimates range from 0
to 55 x 106 km2. Databases without cultivated land have focused
primarily on natural (or potential) vegetation prior to human
activities (e.g., Prentice et al., 1992; Neilson et al., 1992), while
the largest values for this class (e.g., Solomon et al., 1993) stem
from evaluations of land that could potentially be used for cul-

sectors focus on moving toward a more sustainable use of

the ecosystems involved. Many of these options could well
have other positive side effects, including pollution reduction,
slowing the rate of land degradation, and biodiversity conser-

fossil fuel use illustrates the potential for competing demands
for land. The suggested quantities of biomass can theoretically
be provided by ecosystems globally—for example, through
biomass plantations that can be established on many types of
lands (Hall and Overend, 1987). However, minimizing costs

mass close to urban areas; it is in such places where the great-

"Food security has long been a major concern, and several analy-
ses have been conducted to evaluate whether the future food sup-
ply will be adequate to feed the growing population (e.g., FAO,
1993; Bongaarts, 1994; Dyson, 1994; Kendall and Pimentel,
1994; Smil, 1994; Waggoner, 1994). Many of these studies sug-
gest that the land could provide food for the increasing popula-
tion if current trends in agricultural productivity driven by
improved management, use of high-yielding varieties, and
changed cropping systems can be sustained. Other studies, how-
ever, suggest that increasing land degradation, limited water sup-
ply, and dependence on energy-intensive fertilizers, combined
with a growing population, have already started to lead to a
decline in per capita food production and land availability (e.g.,
Kendall and Pimentel, 1994), Continued downward trends
would render the global food supply much less secure than
appears from many analyses (Kendall and Pimentel, 1994).
"	Text
"The results of the above analyses are particularly sensitive to
assumptions about dietary preferences. Different consumption
patterns can lead to very different gross requirements. The
amount of food consumed per capita differs significantly by
country and region. Diets consisting mainly of grains and veg-
etables (e.g., China; Table 25-2) require different quantities
and types of agricultural land compared to diets containing
more meat and dairy products (e.g., United States, Table 25-2).
A meat-based diet for the entire world population would clear-
ly exceed current agricultural capabilities (Waggoner, 1994). A
conceptually simple means to provide food for the increasing
population would be to alter dietary habits. Although a slight
shift from red meat toward poultry is occurring in the devel-
oped world (thereby reducing total feed grain requirements),
red meat consumption is increasing in many other parts of the
world (World Resources Institute, 1992). Bringing about
dietary changes may be difficult to implement.

"Approximately 11% of the land surface has been converted to
cropland, and roughly 25% is occupied by pasture (FAO,
1991); 6% is legally protected in conservation areas and
reserves (Morris, 1995). About half of the remaining forests
and woodlands are managed secondary forests or plantations.
In addition to the readily apparent changes in land cover, much
of the land has been degraded or is at risk of degradation,
including topsoil loss, nutrient depletion, acidification, and
compaction. Recent estimates are 750 Mha for light degrada-
tion, 910 Mha for moderate degradation, and 310 Mha for
severe degradation (World Resources Institute, 1992;
Oldeman, 1993). Damaged and degraded lands can generally
be rehabilitated to a productive state, but not always restored to
their desired use (Barrow, 1991; Brown and Lugo, 1994), All
of these transformations have had a large impact on natural
processes, biodiversity, and the resilience of ecosystems, and

When suboptimal water and nutrient availability (mainly nitro-

biomass ranges from 60-90% of the theoretical potential yield

petition for resources (including light); weeds; diseases; pests;
and local air, water, and soil pollution. Proper land manage-

"Biomass production competes with land required for food pro-

productive lands, whereas biomass crops can probably be
grown on less-productive lands as well (Hal! and Overend,

would lead (at least initially) to lower yields. It is often argued
that biomass plantations can assist in the rehabilitation or
improvement of degraded agricultural land and that these lands
could be used in a profitable and sustainable manner (e.g.,
Bongaarts, 1994; Hall et ai., 1994). Although this is probably
true for regions with lightly and moderately degraded soils
(about 16.5 x 106 km2), plantations are unlikely to be useful in
regions with severely degraded soils (about 3.1 x 10° km2),

biological productivity) are to be restored (Barrow, 1991;

"Whereas most emphasis in biomass energy has been directed
toward terrestrial systems, proposed alternative sources include
micro-algae, marine algae, and halophytes, which grow rapidly
in saline lands. Micro-algae are single-celled, fast-growing
plants that grow well over a wide range of environmental con-
ditions. In regions with inexpensive flatlands, shallow ponds
can be constructed where these algae can reproduce (Wyman,
1994), but this technique is currently quite expensive. Because
their productivity is usually high, the potential use of marine
algae for the conversion of solar energy is large (Orr and
Sarmiento, 1992), but their natural extent is limited to regions
of high nutrients (i.e., areas of upwelling). Currently, cultivation
of marine algae is commercially viable only for specific pur-
poses (pharmaceutical, chemical, and food products), because it
is too expensive for large-scale biomass production (Bird,
1987). Saline lands in coastal zones and arid regions could pro-
duce biomass using halophytes (Glenn et al., 1993). Although
halophytes could assist in slowing or rehabilitating degraded

"There are four fundamental approaches to geoengineering that
have been suggested to limit the perturbing effects and
impacts of GHG emissions: (1) accelerating the removal of
greenhouse gases from the atmosphere; (2) altering the Earth’s
radiation balance to compensate for the effects of the increase
in concentrations of GHGs; (3) moderating the climatic
response to increasing GHGs by counteracting the positive
feedback processes in the atmosphere-ocean-land surface sys-
tem; and (4) counteracting the harmful effects of the changes
that do occur.

"Proposed approaches for accelerating the natural removal
processes for CO, include enhancing the storage of carbon by
the terrestrial biosphere and enhancing the pumping of carbon
to the deep ocean by the oceanic biosphere. In these schemes,
solar energy and photosynthesis would be used to power a
removal process facilitated by human intervention. The advan-
tages and disadvantages of possible approaches involving the
enhancement of terrestrial carbon storage (e.g., in forests or
soils), and the potential for deriving biomass fuels through
these efforts, are covered in Chapters 23 and 24; approaches
focusing on enhancing ocean removal are addressed here.

"Direct removal of GHGs from the atmosphere is generally
impractical—the concentrations being so dilute that it would
be comparatively more practical, although still quite costly, to
remove GHGs from the emissions stream at their sources. As
an example of the impracticality of such direct efforts,
Viggiano et al. (1995) analyzed a proposal to remove chloro-
fluorocarbons (CFCs) already released to the atmosphere
using negative-ion chemistry techniques and found that the
energy requirements brought the cost of the proposal well
above the costs of approaches such as limiting the uses and
emissions of CFCs.

"Because of the chemical buffering of the atmospheric CO,
concentration by the ocean, reduction of the atmospheric con-
centration would require extensive fertilization of the ocean to
promote biological carbon uptake. Studies indicate that iron
fertilization of the Southern Ocean would lead to only modest
additional oceanic uptake of carbon. A recent iron-fertilization
experiment on an 8 x 8 km oceanic plot sought to enhance bio-
logical carbon uptake but concluded that, although growth
was initially enhanced, the net effect was negligible due to
losses in the food chain (Martin et al., 1994). However, pre-

economic, and cultural driving forces of land use with physical
and ecological (including agricultural) options for land use and
land cover (Turner et al., 1993; Meyer and Turner, 1994). For
example, large-scale development of biomass plantations
could limit degradation of dry lands (e.g., by desertification)
and enhance C sequestration, but also could have negative
impacts on biodiversity in other regions as a result of increased
deforestation or restrictions on the types of afforestation that
are feasible (Ramakrishnan et al., 1994). Unfortunately, such
an integrated approach is only in the early stages of develop-

"Climate change induced by GHG emissions is an accidental
result of human activities. The question, therefore, arises as
to whether there are practical, large-scale, deliberate actions
that might be taken to counterbalance these inadvertent
changes. Such actions, sometimes referred to as “geoengi-
neering” the climate, differ from traditional mitigative
actions—which attempt to reduce the causes of the perturbing
influences—in that the geoengineering approaches allow the
emissions but seek to negate or reverse their influence or
effects. While some geoengineering options have been sug-
gested, in general they would require significant efforts rela-
tive to implementing alternative energy technologies or to
moderating and avoiding the actions causing the greenhouse

"The oceans cover more than twice as much area as the land, are
uninhabited by humans, and contain much more carbon than
the terrestrial biosphere (~40,000 vs. ~2,200 Gt C, respective-
ly)—making the potential for enhancing oceanic storage seem-
ingly significant. In the oceans, the biosphere acts to slowly
pump carbon into the deep ocean, while the net effect of the
oceanic circulation is to bring carbon back to the surface to be
released into the atmosphere. In preindustrial (but postglacial)
times, these biological and circulation fluxes were avparently
in quite close balance, keeping the atmospheric concentration
nearly constant. With human activities releasing about 7 Gt C
per year to the atmosphere, the net flux to the deep ocean is
estimated to have increased by about 2 Gt C per year (primar-
ily by increased downward transport of carbon). Enhancing
this circulation-based removal process to accommodate a
greater fraction of fossil-fuel carbon emissions would reduce
the atmospheric burden, but such changes would be very diffi-
cult to achieve (although the natural downward flux will rise
slowly as the CO, concentration increases).

injection of sulfate aerosols into the troposphere can lead to a
counterbalancing effect to GHGs (National Academy of

"Reducing solar radiation reaching the top of the atmosphere
is conceptually possible by putting mirrors either in Sun-
synchronous or near-Earth orbits. The first approach would
involve placing a 2,000 km-diameter solar radiation deflector
at the first Sun-Earth Lagrange point (1.5 million km from
Earth), as suggested by Early (1989). Although this would
require significant initial efforts—possibly including a con-
struction base on the Moon—it would be relatively easy to sus-
tain, would have few inadvertent consequences, and could be
incrementally controlled or removed in the event of unexpect-
ed side effects. The National Academy of Sciences (1992)
explored a near-Earth option involving orbiting mirrors. They
estimated that counterbalancing the effects of a 50% increase
in the CO, concentration would require placing about 55,000
mirrors, each measuring 10 x 10 km, into orbit; such objects—
in addition to being difficult to control—would eclipse the Sun,

"Several approaches have been suggested to counterbalance the
additional trapping of infrared radiation of GHGs by reducing
the available solar energy. A number of analyses (e.g., Manabe
and Wetherald, 1980; Hansen and Lacis, 1990) have suggested
an approximate equivalence in the influence of changes in
radiative forcing by infrared and solar radiation; however,
more-recent simulations that include the effects of the oceans
show that the equivalence is less than perfect in terms of the
latitudinal and seasonal patterns of the climatic response
(Hansen et al., 1994). Nonetheless, at least some of the solar-
reduction schemes could be latitudinally and perhaps seasonal-
ly tailored to achieve essential equivalence, so that the result-
ing radiative change would be nearly equal and opposite.
Comparisons described below generally assume the need for a
reduction in solar radiation of 1%, which would roughly coun-
terbalance a 50% increase in CO, concentration. Note, howev-
er, that to be effective over time, the intensity of the counter-
balancing effort would have to increase continuously to match
the increasing GHG effect, requiring a continually increasing,
and major, societal commitment.

"Within the atmosphere, several concepts have been suggested
for reducing solar radiation by the requisite amount; each
approach has its advantages and disadvantages (National
Academy of Sciences, 1992; Flannery et al., 1995). About a
trillion reftective balloons—each several meters in diameter
and floating in the upper stratosphere—would neither create
partial eclipses nor significantly affect stratospheric chemistry
but likely would be hard to design and hard to keep near the
equator. The multitude of injected aluminum particles from
rocket exhaust and the burn-up of reentering spacecraft may
already be having a very minor influence of this type; see
Brady et al. (1994) and TRW (1994) for an evaluation of their
effects on the ozone layer. Continuous injection of sulfate
aerosols into the stratosphere could be carried out to create the
equivalent of a very large volcanic eruption. While this could
be achieved at low cost using large artillery pieces for injection
(see National Academy of Sciences, 1992), volcanic aerosols
have tended to deplete stratospheric ozone. The aerosols would
also whiten the skies because they scatter radiation forward
more effectively than they reflect it. Injection of sufficient
amounts of sooty aerosols into the stratosphere would cause
warming in the stratosphere while cooling the troposphere—
much like a suggested “nuclear winter” (Turco et al., 1983;
Pittock et al., 1989). Due to the infrared effects resulting from
stratospheric warming, the amount of soot injected would need
to be quite significant. In this case, the sky would dim rather
than whiten. Even though direct effects on ozone chemistry
might be avoided because pure soot particles can be made
unreactive to stratospheric ozone, the increased temperatures
in the stratosphere might tend to decrease ozone concentra-
tions. Other inadvertent environmental consequences of such
measures remain poorly researched.

the ocean with a substance as reflective as new snow; such a

the surface climate.

greenhouse warming also have been suggested. For example,
the predicted sea-level rise could be reduced by coating the
polar ice caps to reduce melting or by pumping sea-water up

however, such projects would create enormous energy
demands. Alternatively, it might be possible (e.g., by manipu-

increase snowfall onto East Antarctica; in fact, such a snow
build-up may happen naturally (see Chapter 7, Changes in Sea

simulations of global biogeochemical and physical processes

"If undertaken as a complement to reducing or slowing an unex-

activities might be required only for a few decades. However,
if undertaken as an alternative to actions to limit increasing
emissions of greenhouse gases, geoengineering options would
have to continue for many centuries—becoming a new, formi-
dable, and quite possibly very costly societal responsibility.
Assumption of this responsibility would need to be considered
very carefully because suddenly halting such actions, even
unintentionally, would, at least for most approaches, cause a
rapid climatic readjustment toward the higher temperature state
projected as a consequence of the inadvertent activities (i.e.,
the Earth would face the “climatic shock” of sudden green-
house warming). Such a situation might well lead to more
detrimental impacts than the slower warming projected if geo-
engineering options were not undertaken.

"Possible approaches have not been carefully considered, but
might include reducing the rate of evaporation of water (e.g., by
coating or covering water surfaces) to reduce the intensity of

enhancing the intensity of the oceanic thermohaline circulation
(which would cool low latitudes and might promote increased.
heat loss in high latitudes); or altering atmospheric chemistry
(e.g., by reducing tropospheric ozone to reduce its positive
greenhouse effect). These proposed ideas have not been studied
in even a preliminary way; however, each of these concepts like-
ly has important side effects (e.g., altering precipitation patterns)
that are as significant as the inadvertent perturbation to be avoid-
ed. Moreover, the positive feedbacks that they are intended to
counteract have been poorly quantified; therefore, it is not yet
possible to assess the effectiveness of these approaches.

tific uncertainties, the UN Convention on the Prohibition of
Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental
Modification Techniques, which entered into force 5 October
1978, may introduce complications if some countries may be
negatively impacted while others benefit. Geoengineering,
therefore, should be considered a viable response option only
if imminent and especially rapid or threatening inadvertent
change be found as a result of projected greenhouse warming
(e.g., if collapse of the polar ice caps and concomitant sea-level
rise are imminent). For this reason, exploring the advantages
and shortcomings of the range of approaches and alternatives
is a useful precaution but is not justified at the expense of the-

"Many of these assessments also focus only on CO,, neglecting

because—through well-established linkages with other biolog-

gases such as CH, (e.g., Dacey ef al., 1994), Furthermore,
competing land uses often are neglected or poorly evaluated.
Determination of the effectiveness of mitigation options and

aspects of land use are guaranteed, and in which important
physical and biogeochemical processes, linkages, and feed-

"IAMs can be used to evaluate the implications of extensive
biomass plantations on land use and availability. This section
discusses simulation results using two very different IAMs as
examples: IMAGE 2.0 (Alcamo ef al., 1994) and MiniCAM
2.0 (Edmonds et al., 1995). The basic structures of the models
are described in Boxes 25-2 and 25-3, respectively. IMAGE
2.0 is a targets-based IAM with considerable regional and sec-
toral detail of potential physical impacts. These impacts, how-
ever, are not given economic values. Also, the model does not
include explicit representations of uncertainty. It does, howev-
er, account for land use and changes in land cover through
physical and biogeochemical feedbacks, such as changes in
albedo, terrestrial carbon storage, and enhanced plant growth.
MiniCAM 2.0, on the other hand, is designed to balance the
costs and benefits of climate-change policies. In this model,
constraints on human activities are explicitly represented and
costed out. However, the model has a more aggregated repre-
sentation of climate-change impacts.

"The IMAGE 2.0 baseline scenario uses the population and
economic growth assumptions from the IPCC IS92a scenario
(Leggett et al., 1992); other scenario input variables come
from a variety of sources (Alcamo et al., 1994). As part of this
baseline, it is assumed that biomass is used for the generation
of 208 EJ energy worldwide in 2100 (and 74 EJ in 2050),
thereby reducing the dependence on fossil fuels. The basic
assumption for this baseline is that most of this biomass would
be taken from readily available sources, such as agricultural
and forestry residues, municipal waste, and so forth. A second
scenario assumes that only 60% of this demand is readily
available, while the remaining 40% has to come from specific
biomass crops. .This “biomass crop scenario” results globally
in an increased demand for agricultural land. A third scenario
assumes that no modern biomass is used and that an equiva-
lent amount of the energy demand would be satisfied by oil
instead. This “no biomass scenario” does not alter land-cover
patterns. The three scenarios differ in their regional and glob-
al patterns of fluxes, sources, and sinks of greenhouse gases
(Table 25-3).

"Such integration can be successful only if the relevant proper-
ties and dimensions of each domain (e.g., geosphere, biosphere,
anthroposphere) are addressed. For example, early carbon-cycle
models aggregated all land covers into a few classes character-
ized by globally averaged parameters (e.g., Goudriaan and
Ketner, 1984). Although such an approach is straightforward to
implement, it does not allow assessment of local and regional
consequences of global change (see Chapter 24) and is therefore
unsuitable for evaluation of the efficacy of mitigation options.
In current assessment models, continental-scale regions are
assumed to be homogeneous. Thus, these models are not capa-
ble of representing the wealth of socioeconomic components
and market forces that cause and react to change at the commu-
nity, state, and national level. Similar arguments can be devel-
oped for all other domains. To address the heterogeneous
response of biogeochemical processes, a georeferenced
approach has to be adopted. More-recent models have taken
such an approach (e.g., Melillo et al., 1993; Klein Goldewijk et
al., 1994), The integrated models required to evaluate mitiga-
tion options and strategies should be robust and convey confi-

simultaneously considering regional to global characteristics.

"IMAGE 2.0 (Integrated Model to Assess the Greenhouse Effect) is a multidisciplinary, integrated model of climate change.
The model is designed to provide support for comprehensive evaluations of national and international policies concerning
the build-up of GHGs. The model consists of three fully linked components: Energy Industry System (EIS), Terrestrial
Environment System (TES), and Atmosphere Ocean System (AOS). EIS divides the world into 13 regions and computes
emissions in each as a function of energy consumption and industrial production. The EIS-models are designed to investi-
gate the effectiveness of different fuel mixes and improved energy efficiencies. TES defines the role of the terrestrial bios-
phere using vegetation-climate-soil interactions and determining the impacts of land-use change. The dynamic simulation of
land-use and land-cover change is an important component of TES. These changes are simulated on a 0.5-degree global
grid. Each grid cell is characterized by its climate, topography, soil, and land cover. Changes in natural vegetation are simu-
lated with the BIOME model (Prentice et al., 1992). Potential productivity for eight major crops is computed using the
“agro-ecological zone” approach developed by UN-FAO (Brinkman, 1987; Leemans and Solomon, 1993). This approach
provides the potential distribution and productivity of crops and natural vegetation over the grid. For each region, the
demand for land-based commodities (crops, livestock, biomass, lumber, and fuelwood) is calculated. The per capita con-
sumption is derived from an assumed elasticity between consumption and per capita income. Population, dietary prefer-
ences, and socioeconomic factors control changes in demand. Agricultural data for the period 1970-1990 from FAO were
used to parameterize the demand functions and to calibrate the geo-referenced area of cultivated land from Olson et al.
(1985) with observed regional productivities. TES then reconciles the demand for land with its potential through a set of
heuristic rules that reflect key driving factors, including proximity to infrastructure, population, and productivity of land.
This relatively simple model results in rich patterns of land use and cover change for each region. These changed patterns
are used to calculate the GHG emissions and local responses of ecosystems with respect to the terrestrial carbon cycle. TES
allows evaluation of the impact of environmental changes on ecosystems and agriculture and the effectiveness of mitigation
policies. Such evaluation can be achieved comprehensively because of the systemic linkages with other components of
IMAGE 2. TES is linked with EIS through the demand for fuelwood and biomass. TES and AOS are indirectly linked
through changes in soil moisture and albedo, mediated by land-cover change. All emissions are combined in AOS to deter-
mine atmospheric concentrations of GHGs, while accounting for atmospheric chemistry and oceanic carbon uptake.

emissions of CH, and other GHGs. The realized climate

"resulting from the technologies described in the LESS con-
structions in Chapter 19. The principal finding of the analysis
was that with biomass productivities as high as that considered
in LESS, negative impacts from the competition for land use
are minimal. That is, increases in emissions from land-use
change are likely to be less than 10%, and per capita consump-
tion of crops and livestock also are likely to be within 10% of
their reference values. The results, however, are sensitive to
several assumptions, such as the productivity of biomass ener-
gy plants, the rate of technological progress in agriculture, and
the rates of population and income growth.

"‘The boundary between the managed and less-managed systems is determined by the expected profitability of managed
lands in general. Within ALM, global markets are established for each of the major traded commodities—crops, live-
stock, and forest products—and a world price is established that clears international markets. Biomass for energy use is
determined interactively with the ERB. Because biomass is used as an energy resource, its demand and price are deter-
mined in the ERB while its supply is determined in the ALM. Changes in land allocations determine net trace-gas fluxes
from the terrestrial biosphere, while the ERB determines energy-related emissions, Other emissions, such as those from
cement manufacture and from CFCs and their substitutes, are handled exogenously.

"MiniCAM 2.0 is an integrated assessment model with four major components: Human Activities, Atmospheric
Composition, Climate and Sea Level, and Ecological Systems. The model considers energy and land-use change both
explicitly and interactively. The energy system model is the Edmonds-Reilly-Barns (ERB) model (Edmonds and Reilly,
1985), while the agriculture land-use model (ALM) was developed explicitly for MiniCAM 2.0, ALM partitions land
into managed and less-managed systems. The managed lands are used intensively for human settlement and infrastruc-
ture and extensively for growing crops, raising livestock, managed forests, or biomass cultivation for energy use. Less-
managed lands are partitioned into ecological categories. The allocation of lands to human settlement and infrastructure
is determined by population and income, and this use of land takes precedence in the model over all other uses of man-
aged land. Extensive land uses are determined by expected profitability—which in turn depends on plant productivities,
product prices, technology, fertilization, atmospheric CO, concentrations, climate, population, income, taxes, tariffs, and

subsidies. Less-managed lands include those that are “parked” (i.e., excluded from use for managed activities) and those
that are potentially available for managed uses.

"The discussion in this chapter is, at best, a roadmap of the types
of cross-sectoral issues and tradeoffs decisionmakers will need
to consider in evaluating the various mitigation options. While
the analysis has focused on energy and land use—which are two
key arteries cutting across the various sectors—issues relating
to society’s demands for water and how water resources would
be affected by different mitigation strategies have not yet been
addressed in the same level of detail. Further, many cross-cut-
ting impacts of mitigation policies also would be transmitted
through trade and market forces. An analysis of these, however,
falls beyond the mandate of this Working Group.
"	Text
"Anumber of cross-sectoral linkages become evident only when
an integrated analysis of climate and socioeconomic systems is
used to complement sectoral analyses. The field of integrated
assessment modeling is still under development, with various
models being used to investigate different plausible ways to
integrate across various disciplines. At present there is no sin-
gle “right” approach to integrated assessment modeling, and
models often have to make tradeoffs between the level of sec-
toral detail they can include and the level of complexity and
data requirements that can be handled realistically. Further,
Integrated Assessment Models are only as good as the under-
lying socioeconomic assumptions and information on sectoral
impacts, adaptation, and mitigation strategies. As discussed
throughout this report, there are key gaps in the understanding
of the climate system, how climate change would impact the
various sectors, and the feasibility and possible ancillary
impacts of various adaptation and mitigation options. Across
these issues, information from developing countries is particu-
larly lacking.

"The exposure unit (i.e., the impacted object) to be assessed
determines, to a large degree, the type of researchers who will
conduct the assessment, the methods to be employed, and the
data required. Studies can focus on a single sector or activity
(e.g., agriculture, forestry, energy production, or water
resources), several sectors in parallel but separately, or several
sectors interactively.

"It is important to be precise about the specific objectives of a
study, as these will affect the conduct of the investigation. For
example, an assessment of the hydrological impacts of future
climatic change in a river catchment would have quite differ-
ent requirements for data and expertise if the goal is to estimate
the capacity for power generation than if it is to predict
changes in agricultural income as a result of changes in the
availability of water for irrigation.
"	List
"The availability of data is probably the major limitation in most
impact and adaptation assessment studies. The collection of
new data is an important element of some studies, particularly
for monitoring purposes regarding expected climate changes,
but most rely on existing sources. Thus, before embarking on
a detailed assessment, it is important to identify the main fea-
tures of the data requirements—namely, the variables for
which data are needed, the time period, spatial coverage and
resolution of the required data, the sources and format of the
data and their quantity and quality, and the data availability,
cost, and delivery time.
"	Text
"These Guidelines, which are a further development of those
previously published (Carter et al., 1992), provide a means for
assessing the impacts of potential climate change and of eval-
uating appropriate adaptations. They reflect current knowl-
edge and will be updated as improved methodologies are
developed. They do not aim to prescribe a single preferred
method, but provide an analytical outline composed of a num-
ber of steps. A range of methods is idéntified at each step.
Where possible, the merits and drawbacks of different meth-
ods are briefly discussed, with some suggestions on their
selection and use.
"	Text
"The selection of a time horizon for study is also influenced
by the goals of the assessment. For example, in studies of
industrial impacts the planning horizons may be 5-10
years, while investigations of tree growth may require a
100-year perspective. However, as the time horizon
increases, the ability to accurately project future trends
declines rapidly. Most climate projections and scenarios
rely on general circulation models (GCMs), which are sub-
ject to uncertainties. Projections of socioeconomic factors
such as population, economic development, and technolog-
ical change need to be made for periods exceeding 15-20
years.

tial patterns of climate change and their impacts and to devel-

"A variety of analytical methods can be adopted ranging from
qualitative descriptive studies, through more diagnostic and
semi-quantitative assessments, to quantitative and prognostic
analyses. Any single impact assessment may contain elements
of one or more of these types. Four general methods can be
identified: experimentation, impact projections, empirical ana-
log studies, and expert judgment.

"Integrated systems models represent an attempt to combine
elements of the modeling approaches described above into a
comprehensive model of a given regionally or sectorally
bounded system. Two main approaches to integration can be
identified: the aggregate cost-benefit approach, which is more
economically oriented, and the regionalized process-based
approach, which focuses more on biophysical effects.
"	Text
"Biophysical models may be used to evaluate the physical inter-
actions between climate and an exposure unit. There are two
main types: Empirical-statistical models and process-based
models, Empirical-statistical models are based on the statisti-
cal relationships between climate and the exposure unit.
Process-based models make use of established physical laws
and theories to express the dynamics of the interactions
between climate and an exposure unit.
"	Text
"Observations of the interactions of climate and society.in a
region can be of value in anticipating future impacts. The most
common method employed involves the transfer of informa-
tion from a different time or place to an area of interest to serve
as an analogy. Four types of analogy can be identified:
Historical event analogies, historical trend analogies, regional
analogies of present climate, and regional analogies of future
climate.
"	Text
"In the physical sciences, a standard method of testing hypothe-
ses or of evaluating processes of cause and effect is through
direct experimentation. In the context of climate impact and
adaptation assessment, however, experimentation has only a lim-
ited application. Clearly it is not possible physically to simulate
large-scale systems such as the global climate. Only where the
scale of impact is manageable, the exposure unit measurable,
and the environment controllable can experiments be usefully
conducted (e.g., gas enrichment experiments with plants).
"	Text
"One of the major goals of climate impact assessment, especial-
ly concerning aspects of future climatic change, is the predic-
tion of future impacts. A main focus of much recent work has —
been on impact projections, using an array of mathematical
models to extrapolate into the future. First-order effects of cli-
mate are usually assessed using biophysical models, and sec-
ond- and higher order effects using a range of biophysical, eco-
nomic, and qualitative models. Finally, attempts also have
been made at comprehensive assessments using integrated sys-
tems models.

the nonenvironmental factors that influence the exposure unit.
The factors may be geographical (e.g., land use), technological
(e.g., pollution control), managerial (e.g., forest rotation), leg-
islative (e.g., air quality standards), economic (e.g., commodi-
ty prices), social (e.g., population), or political (e.g., land
tenure). All of these are liable to change in the future, so it is
important that baseline conditions of the most relevant factors
are noted.

"The time horizon selected depends primarily on the goals of
the assessment. However, there are obvious limits on the
ability to project into the future. Climate projections, since
they are a key element of climate impact studies, define one
possible outer limit on impact projections. GCM estimates
seldom extend beyond about 100 years, due to the uncertain-
ties attached to such long-term projections and to constraints
on computational resources. This fixes an outer horizon at
about 2100. In many economic assessments, on the other
hand, projections may not be reliable for more than a few
years ahead.

"It is important to ensure that future climate, environment, and
socioeconomic projections are mutually consistent over space
and time. It is important to be clear about (i) the relative tim-
ing of increases in greenhouse gas concentrations and climate
change, and (ii) the relative timing of a 2 x CO, compared to
a 2x CO, “equivalent” atmosphere.! With regard to the for-
mer, there is a lag time of several decades in the response of
the climate system to increases in greenhouse gas concentra-
tions. With regard to the latter, a 2 x CO, “equivalent” atmos-
phere occurs earlier than a 2 x CO, atmosphere because gases
such as CH,, N,O, and tropospheric 03 also contribute to
radiative forcing.

"The testing of predictive models is, arguably, the most critical
stage of an impact assessment. Most studies rely almost exclu-
sively on the use of models to estimate future impacts. Thus, it
is crucial for the credibility of the research that model perfor-
mance is tested rigorously. Standard procedures should be used
to evaluate models, but these may need to be modified to
accommodate climate change. Two main procedures are recom-
mended: validation and sensitivity analysis. Validation involves
the comparison of model predictions with real world observa-
tions to test model performance. Sensitivity analysis evaluates
the effects on model performance of altering its structure or
parameter values, or the values of its input variables.

"A simple method of specifying a future climate is to adjust the
baseline climate in a systematic, though essentially arbitrary,
manner. Adjustments might include, for example, changes in
mean annual temperature of +1, 2, 3°C, etc., or changes in annu-

many climate impact assessments based on doubled-CO,

mechanisms to be examined and socioeconomic adjustments to
be considered.

"Temporal analogs are of two types: those based on past instru-
mental observations (usually within the last century) and those
based on proxy data, using paleoclimatic indicators such as plant
or animal remains and sedimentary deposits (from the more dis-
tant past geological records). The main problem with this tech-
nique concerns the physical mechanism and boundary conditions
that would almost certainly be different between a warmer cli-
mate in the past and a future greenhouse gas-induced warming.

"In order to conduct experiments to assess the impacts of cli-
mate change, it is first necessary to obtain a quantitative repre-
sentation of the changes in climate themselves. No method yet
exists of providing confident predictions of future climate.
Instead, it is customary to specify a number of plausible future
climates. These are referred to as “climatic scenarios,” and
they are selected to provide climatic data that are spatially
compatible, mutually consistent, freely available or easily
derivable, and suitable as inputs to impact models.

poses. These vary in their time horizon from several years

all projected impacts are measured. It is highly probable that
future changes in other environmental factors will occur even
in the absence of climate change, which may be of importance
for an exposure unit. Examples, as appropriate, include
changes in land use, changes in groundwater level, and
changes in air, water, and soil pollution. Most factors are relat-

socioeconomic factors. Greenhouse gas concentrations may
also change, but these would usually be linked: to climate

with GCMs—-specifically, simulations of the response of climate
to a transient forcing. These simulations offer several advantages
over equilibrium-response experiments. First, the specifications
of the atmospheric perturbation are more realistic, involving a
continuous (transient) change over time in greenhouse gas con-
centrations. Second, the representation of the oceans is more real-
istic, the most recent simulations coupling atmospheric models to
dynamic ocean models. Finally, transient simulations provide
information on the rate as well as the magnitude of climate

assessments are greenhouse gas concentrations and sea-level rise.
Future changes in these are still under discussion, but the estimates
reported by the IPCC may serve as a useful basis for constructing
scenarios (IPCC, 1990). Other factors that are directly affected by
climate (such as river flows, runoff, erosion) would probably
require full impact assessments of their own, although some might
be incorporated as “automatic adjustments” in projections.

"GCMs produce estimates of climatic variables for a regular net-
work of grid points across the globe. Results from about 20
GCMs have been reported to date (e.g., see IPCC, 1990, 1992).
However, these estimates are highly uncertain because of some
important weaknesses of GCMs. These include poor model rep-
resentation of cloud processes; a coarse spatial resolution (at best
employing grid cells of some 250-km horizontal dimension);
generalized topography, disregarding some locally important
features; and a simplified representation of land-atmosphere and
ocean-atmosphere interactions. As a result, GCMs are currently
unable to reproduce accurately even the seasonal pattern of pre-
sent-day climate at a regional scale. Thus, GCM outputs repre-
sent, at best, broad-scale sets of possible future climatic condi-

challenges often must be addressed in conducting

comprehensive mitigation options assessments:

— Gaining access to sources of information about

— Extracting useful data or information from the

"Typically, a mitigation assessment process will follow a series
of steps, each of which produces information for decisionmak-
ers at different levels. The manner in which these steps are per-
formed will reflect each country’s resources, objectives, and
decisionmaking process. Generally, these steps can be charac-
terized as follows:

"Baseline development: Baselines, or “business-as-
usual” scenarios, describe the growth in emissions
expected as a result of economic growth, population
growth, and other factors, assuming that no explicit
mitigation policies are adopted.

Identification and characterization of alternative
technologies and policies: This may include ranking
options with respect to costs, energy consumption, car-
bon sequestered, and ancillary impacts, among others.
"	List
"How should assessment objectives be prioritized
and who should be involved? Mitigation options
should be measured not only on the basis of their
effectiveness in reducing GHGs but also on the basis
of their contribution to other national objectives, such
as sustainable development, rural development, or
local environmental protection. Multiple stakeholders
will be affected by these choices, so involving them in
the process can be important.

What are the questions being answered by the
analysis? Effective decisionmaking requires the
proper information; thus, mitigation analysis must
focus on the proper questions. These questions will be
defined broadly by national objectives but will vary
depending on the decisionmaking level.

Which organizations will have institutional
responsibility for the analysis? Institutional capabil-
ities are needed to gather data, select options to ana-
lyze, apply the necessary analytical methods, and
communicate results, Key tasks involved in assigning
the appropriate institutions to the assessment include
identifying the available institutional resources,
matching institutions to the research questions to be
asked, coordinating among institutions, linking the
analysis to the decisionmaking process, and designing
feedback on the process to possible stakeholders.
Which organizations will have responsibility for
implementing results? Although the focus of this
chapter is on methods for analysis of mitigation
options, implementation issues cannot be completely
separated in the discussion. Four factors to consider in
the selection of options include the adequacy of
implementation capabilities, institutional support for
implementation, coordination of implementation, and
evaluation and accountability.
"	List
"Cross-sectoral level: At the cross-sectoral level,
alternative sectoral and cross-sectoral (e.g., recycling)
mitigation options are compared to determine their
impact on an economy and other national interests or
goals. Typically this involves compiling information
on sectoral activities that produce GHGs, such as
energy production, or sequester those emissions, such
as forestry activities. This information is integrated
with national goals and priorities, and resources and
responsibilities are allocated to produce a comprehen-
sive, workable plan. The types of methods used to
assess and compare options at this level include
macroeconomic models, decision-analysis tools, cost-
ing methods, and forecasting tools.

Sectoral level: The sectoral level involves analysis to
compare the impacts of individual programs or large-
scale projects within a specific sector principally for
the purpose of prioritizing options and determining
sectoral resource requirements. For example, the emis-
sion reduction potential and cost per ton of carbon
dioxide (CO,) reduced might be compared for options
such as energy-efficiency standards, building codes,
and rebates on high-efficiency appliances. As in the
cross-sectoral level, costing and forecasting tools are
important, although they focus on more detailed pro-
gram and project information. In addition, integrated
analytical tools are becoming available for certain sec-
tors such as energy and forestry that can compare rel-
atively disparate options on a more common basis.
Program level: Program-level analysis compares the
costs and impacts of individual projects or bundles of
projects for the purpose of developing mitigation pro-
grams. A program might consist of a series of projects
to introduce improved forestry-management practices
into a region. As in cross-sectoral and sectoral analysis,
project costing and forecasting tools are important.
Technology costing and performance, market research,
and monitoring and evaluation tools also are important.
Project level: At the project level, the purpose of
analysis is typically to identify and characterize spe-
cific project options in terms of their financial costs,
technical performance, environmental characteristics,
and so forth. Identifying options may involve litera-
ture reviews, case studies, and expert judgment.
Characterizing options often relies extensively on
engineering estimates, performance assessments, and

on a

"27.5. Key Methodological Issues
"	Title
"The choice and use of most analytical methods involve a num-
ber of methodological issues that decisionmakers and analysts
should be aware of when considering a mitigation options
assessment. Some of these issues are unique to certain meth-
ods, while others cut across many methods. This section out-
lines nine key methodological issues that span a number of
methods:
"	Text
"Development of alternative scenarios: Alternative
scenarios include future projections of emissions
[usually based on the global warming potential
(GWP) of all GHGs] and costs, assuming that mitiga-
tion actions are taken.

Estimation of incremental costs and benefits of
options: Incremental costs and benefits are the differ-
ence between the baseline and alternative scenarios.
Assessment of the impacts of alternative GHG mit-
igation scenarios: Impacts to consider could include
macroeconomic, social, and environmental costs and
benefits, and equity.

Sensitivity analysis: The sensitivity of results to
uncertainties in data or alternative assumptions is
often assessed to ensure that the results are reliable
and credible.
"	List
"1) Top-down versus bottom-up analysis: Significant
controversy has existed between top-down and bot-
tom-up approaches to estimating the costs of mitiga-
tion options. Each approach estimates mitigation costs
differently, often with significantly different results.
The top-down approach generally looks at macroeco-
nomic impacts of alternative mitigation scenarios on
income, consumption, or gross domestic product
(GDP), A key assumption in the top-down approach is
that economies are in equilibrium and that mitigating
GHGs, therefore, generally entails some net cost to an
economy. This assumption is often questioned by bot-
tom-up analysts. Top-down models also have had
problems accounting for different rates of technologi-
cal change. The bottom-up approach looks at the
microeconomic costs of and changes in demand due to
individual mitigation options. It generally assumes
that there are inefficiencies in the marketplace that
allow for cost-effective mitigation options. Bottom-up
models have had problems accounting for consumer
behavior and administrative costs. In general, the top-
down approach yields higher cost estimates for GHG
mitigation than the bottom-up approach. Both
approaches can serve important purposes, however,
and improvements in both approaches are leading to
more balanced results (Borero et al., 1991; Krause et
al., 1993; UNEP, 1992). See IPCC Working Group III
volume, Chapter 8, Estimating Costs of Mitigating
Greenhouse Gases, Section 8.3.3., for a more thorough
description of this issue.

Matching method to objective: Choosing the appro-
priate method for the analytical task depends on
matching methods to objectives. For example, one
objective for an expanding economy may be mini-
mizing the impacts of GHG mitigation on the indus-
trial sector. Sectoral impacts may be more appropri-
ately measured using a macroeconomic analysis of
options rather than an engineering cost approach.
Alternatively, if an objective is to identify all tech-
nologies or policies that are cost-effective, a combi-
nation of engineering and cost-effectiveness methods
may provide the best approach.

Specifying the baseline and alternative scenarios:
Scenarios are used to portray future GHG emissions
and economic activity without mitigation options in
place (baseline or business-as-usual scenarios) or with
policies in place (mitigation scenarios). Several issues
in developing scenarios include the degree to which all
sources and sinks are covered; the reasonableness of
assumptions on economic growth, technology change,
and market imperfections; the consistency of assump-
tions across analytical steps; and the capacity to incor-
porate feedbacks. Clearly defined scenarios are impor-
tant for providing decisionmakers with useful guid-
ance on the allocation of national resources. Scenarios
also can play a significant role in the allocation of
international funding for climate mitigation projects—
for example, through the Global Environment Facility
and through joint implementation projects.
Accounting for uncertainty: Most analyses are
affected by uncertainty due to poor data quality,
dynamic economies, economies with little historical
market data, and so forth. Taking this uncertainty
into account in estimating costs and impacts may be
more practical than trying to achieve complete accu-
racy. This can be done by using “range” rather than
“point” estimates, using expert judgment where
good quantitative data are lacking, use of sensitivity
analyses, and so on. Using these approaches will not
eliminate uncertainty but will allow decisionmakers
to attach greater confidence to those options and
policies that yield favorable results (Stokey and
Zeckhauser, 1978). :

Defining a common measure for comparing
options: A comprehensive and internally consistent
assessment requires a common measure or “metric”
for option comparison where different types of costs
are involved or relevant impacts extend beyond the
direct GHG reductions.

Accounting for time in the analysis of costs and
benefits: The flows of costs and benefits from differ-
ent mitigation options over time are often discounted
to their present values so that they can be compared in
consistent, present-value terms. The choice of dis-
count rates has important implications but can be dif-
ficult to make in practice. Selection of a discount rate
may depend on how displaced private uses are esti-
mated, how imperfections in capital markets are

"	Text
"Table 27-1 illustrates the relationship between analytical meth-
ods and the different decisionmaking levels at which they are
used. As shown, the same types of methods often are used at
various decisionmaking levels (although the way methods are
applied may be different at different levels). This section pro-
vides an overview of key analytical methods, including a brief
description of the types of information the methods provide:
"	Text
"Macroeconomic analysis: Macroeconomic analysis
often is used to describe the current structure of an
economy, to predict future economy-wide conditions
and their impact on GHG emissions, and to analyze
changes in these conditions that could arise from tak-
ing actions to mitigate GHG emissions (Borero et al.,
1991, Cline, 1992).

Decision analysis: Decision-analysis methods pro-
vide a structure for integrating sectoral and cross-sec-
toral GHG mitigation objectives with other national
priorities. Basic decision analysis involves identifying
potential options, measuring the potential impacts of
"	List
"those options (i.e., valuing the outcomes of various
policy scenarios), and, based on this information,
selecting the best options.

Costing analysis: Mitigation costing methods esti-
mate and compare costs and benefits of mitigation
options to identify the set of actions that maximizes
economic, social, and environmental benefits or min-
imizes the analogous costs of reducing GHGs. Four
basic costing methods for ranking mitigation options
are cost-benefit, cost-effectiveness, financial, and cost
or supply curve analysis. More advanced methods
include simulation and optimization models (Beaver
and Huntington, 1991; Borero er al., 1991; Cline,
1992; NAS, 1991; Stokey and Zeckhauser, 1978;
UNEP, 1992, 1993). See the IPCC Working Group III
volume for a detailed discussion of costing issues.
Forecasting: The acceptability of a mitigation strate-
gy, program, or project is determined by calculating
the difference between “what would happen anyway”
and “what would happen if mitigation measures were
undertaken.” The definition and development of
these scenarios play a significant role in mitigation
assessment. Forecasting is used here as a general
term applied to methods used in developing time-
dependent scenarios, such as econometric, time-series
analysis, and end-use forecasting models.

Integrated planning: Integrated planning approaches
provide a structure for complex regional or sectoral
assessments of multiple mitigation options. These meth-
ods tvnicallv are process or decision analvtic-hased and

accounted for, and, perhaps most importantly, to what
extent a country is willing to forgo current consump-
tion and investment in favor of future environmental
protection. Higher discount rates generally favor cur-
rent consumption, while lower discount rates general-
ly favor future environmental protection. Sensitivity
analyses with different discount rates often are
employed to estimate their different impacts (Stokey
and Zeckhauser, 1978).

Accounting for externalities and ancillary impacts:
Virtually every mitigation option will produce some
positive or negative externality and/or ancillary
impact. Whether quantifiable or not, these impacts
represent real costs or benefits and should be factored
into the assessment process.

Data requirements: A comprehensive mitigation
assessment can require detailed information on liter-
ally hundreds of options. Few industrialized countries
have access to all the data that would be required, but
data availability is an even more serious constraint on
developing countries. The cost of data collection is an
important factor to weigh in developing a mitigation
assessment.

Understanding the limits of models: Quantitative
models, from simple spreadsheet costing models to
sophisticated macroeconomic models, can be very
useful for managing complex analytical tasks.
However, the accuracy of the results from these mod-
els depends on the quality of data, the choice of
assumptions, the appropriateness of the model to the
analytical task, and so forth. All of these require good
judgment and skill on the part of the analyst. The sim-
ple conclusion is that models are not a substitute for
good analysis.

"The technical report accompanying this chapter iden-
tifies more than 40 often-used methods for analyzing
mitigation options. Many more exist that can address
specific issues or adapt to different levels of analyti-
cal capability. The technical report also provides
countries with approaches for organizing a mitigation
options assessment, from identifying national goals to
estimating the costs of specific technology options.
As with specific analytical methods, assessment
processes can take many different forms, depending
on the country’s needs and conditions.

"Analytical, technical, and institutional resources are
available from many multilateral and bilateral orga-
nizations to assist developing countries and countries
with economies in transition in assessing mitigation
options and strategies. Other economic development
assistance programs that support investment deci-
sions in energy production and end-use efficiency,
forestry management, transportation, and agriculture
also may demonstrate ancillary GHG emission miti-
gation benefits.

Mitigation analyses have been and are being applied
in developed, developing, and transitional-economy
countries. These experiences demonstrate that appro-
priate mitigation assessment methods can be applied
to meet the individual needs and conditions of all
countries.

"The availability of mitigation methods and assis-
tance enables all countries to develop strategies
and evaluate programs and projects that support
national economic, social, and institutional devel-
opment goals and can slow the rate of growth in
GHG emissions. The process of conducting a mit-
igation options assessment presents challenges to
all countries. Projects identified in assessments
may be difficult to implement because of a variety
of economic, social, and institutional barriers in all
countries.

Development and application of mitigation assess-
ment methods in all sectors and at all levels is an
ongoing effort that will result in further improvements
in the tools and the capabilities of countries to assess
mitigation options. The IPCC, in coordination with
other multilateral institutions, could accelerate the
dissemination of selected information on assessment
methods through seminars, workshops, and educa-
tional materials.

"can be designed to produce both quantitative and quali-
tative results. A variety of quantitative methods can be
used to support integrated planning. Integrated planning
methods include integrated resource planning (IRP),
used increasingly in the power sector; integrated trans-
portation planning (ITP); and integrated forestry and
agriculture planning (IEC, 1994; Sathaye et al., 1994),
(For more information on integrated planning in
forestry and agriculture, see Chapter 25.)

Market research: Market research is an important
analytical method in program design. Market research
gathers information from prospective consumers of a
particular product or service through focus groups,
survey techniques, product testing, and so forth.
Monitoring and evaluation: Mitigation programs
and projects should be monitored and evaluated for
their actual costs and impacts. The methods used
often are the same used to assess a program or project
in the first place, such as cost-effectiveness analysis
and surveys. The key difference is the need to estab-
lish a monitoring and evaluation system during pro-
gram or project design. This information can help
determine whether initial objectives or targets are
being achieved, how the program or project can be
redesigned to improve results, and how future pro-
jects should be designed.

Options identification: Many different mitigation
options are available, as this report demonstrates. The
analyst needs to identify those options that are most
likely to suit the needs and conditions of his or her
country. Typically, options are screened against a
series of criteria such as technological maturity, com-
mercial availability, and technical performance.
Information on potentially suitable options can come
from case studies, literature reviews, general opportu-
nity studies, and the judgment of specialized experts.
Options characterization: Once data have been
obtained on specific mitigation options, a system is
needed for characterizing options to ensure that the
data obtained can provide usable information. A vari-
ety of methods are available to analysts, including
cost curve analysis, estimates of tons of GHG avoid-
ed, and engineering assessments.

"The United Nations Environment Programme
(UNEP) and the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) provide support to about twenty-
nine developing countries to coordinate climate coun-
try studies that include mitigation options assess-
ments, Additional countries are expected to be added.
The assessments developed through these studies will
provide models of different mitigation strategies,
including least-cost mitigation strategies, that other
countries will be able to follow.

The UK, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United
States together will have supported more than seventy-
five climate country studies in developing countries
and countries with economies in transition. (The total
number of countries involved is somewhat fewer due to
overlap.) Many of these studies are developing mitiga-
tion strategies as one component. It is also noteworthy
that a number of the studies place significant emphasis
on developing local institutional and analytical capabil-
ities to assess and implement mitigation options.

The pilot phase of the Global Environment Facility
allocated about $250 million for more than thirty
global-warming mitigation projects. These funds
were leveraged with additional World Bank and bilat-
eral assistance funds. These projects will soon begin
to yield a wealth of information and practical experi-

"The rationale for the inventory is straightforward. As the glob-
al climate change debate shifts toward studying the need for
action, it is increasingly important for energy and environmen-
tal planners to have access to technical and economic informa-
tion on the options that are available to reduce emissions and
mitigate climate change. This information should be current,
consistent, reliable, and widely available. In some countries,
very good technology data and sophisticated analytical tools
already exist. Often, however, information available from
national or regional studies cannot be directly compared or
adapted to new conditions because it has been collected in dif-
ferent formats or is based on different assumptions. Some
countries, particularly developing and newly industrializing
countries, lack sufficient resources to explore the benefits of
these technologies on their own. In these cases, planners may
rely on data of uncertain provenance, which can lead to unbal-
anced assessments of technology options, questionable data
quality, and, ultimately, poorly informed investments. The
need for wide access to a standardized data set drove the
assembly of this inventory.

"Carbon dioxide is emitted in large quantities by human activi-
ties, mostly as a result of combustion of fossil fuels and vege-
tation. Many techniques have been demonstrated to limit emis-
sions of carbon dioxide from fuel-burning activities by improv-
ing the efficiency with which stored energy is converted to use-
ful energy. The inventory characterizes many such approaches
that have higher energy supply efficiencies than conventional
systems. These approaches cover direct energy production in
the industrial sector, as well as electricity generation, transmis-
sion, and distribution. Some of the technologies described are
particularly suitable for the kinds of fuel resources, energy
demands, and infrastructure found in developing countries.
Appropriate technologies for developing countries, such as
efficient cook stoves, are included in the inventory.
Additionally, energy supply technologies that can replace fuel-
burning technologies and essentially eliminate the direct pro-
duction of carbon dioxide are described. Emphasis is placed on
renewable energy supplies (biomass, solar, hydro, and wind
energy). However, because some industrializing countries are
considering nuclear energy as an option to meet electricity
demand without adding to carbon dioxide emissions, several
advanced nuclear energy options are included.

"Pressurized fluidized-bed combustion (PFBC) is an advanced
technology for burning coal that offers high thermal efficiency
and low environmental emissions. The system operates at pres-
sures of 6-16 atmospheres and typically utilizes smaller combus-
tion chambers than a conventional furnace because of its more
efficient steam production. Due to its high thermal efficiency,
PFBC can reduce the quantity of carbon dioxide emitted per unit
of energy produced. Therefore, it is a potentially useful technolo-
gy for mitigating emissions generated in the production of elec-
tricity. The inventory identifies the anticipated size of commercial
PFBC units (200-400 MW.,), their application (electric power
generation), and the fuels that can be used. Performance mea-
sures of the technology are provided in terms of the operating
thermal efficiency of current demonstration plants (33-42%) and
of projected second-generation plants (45-50%).

"The capital cost of current demonstration plants ($1900-
$3200/kW) is compared with the expected costs of a mature,

costs range between 2.0 and 2.5¢/kWh. Fuel costs can range
anywhere between 2.2 and 34¢/kWh, depending on the type of
fuel chosen. The environmental performance of PFBC is very
good; it generates relatively small quantities of solid waste,
which can be safely landfilled or sold as a byproduct, and it pro-
duces low emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Most
importantly for global climate change, emissions of carbon diox-

"Compact fluorescent lights are slightly bigger and heavier than
incandescent bulbs. Thus, they may not be a suitable replace-
ment in every application. Performance suffers in tight fix-
tures, and under-lit spaces may result if thermal effects are not
considered in system planning. Preheat lamps have a 1- to 2-
second delay before lighting, although rapid-start systems are
becoming available.

"The Environmentally Compatible Energy Strategies (ECS)
Project at the International Institute for Applied Systems
Analysis in Laxenburg, Austria, has developed a comprehen-
sive inventory of technological options for mitigating and
adapting to possible global warming (Schafer et al., 1992). The
supporting data base, CO2DB, contains detailed descriptions
of the technical, economic, and environmental performance of
approximately four hundred technologies. Efficiency improve-
ments, conservation, enhanced use of low-carbon fuels, car-
bon-free sources of energy, afforestation, and enhancement of
carbon sinks are included.

"At the Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH in Germany, the
IKARUS Project has been involved in the development of
computer models and a database for comparing strategies for
reducing the energy-related emissions of greenhouse gases,
particularly carbon dioxide (Katscher, 1993). The technology
database in the IKARUS system contains basic technical, eco-
nomic, and environmental data on individual technologies that
can be used to construct technology chains and feed to sector-
specific simulation models. The goal is to be able to assess mit-
igation possibilities for the German energy system in 1989,
2005, and 2020.

"An interagency joint project on databases and methodologies
for comparative assessment of different energy sources for
electricity generation (DECADES) has been established by the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in collaboration
with several other international organizations, with the objec-
tive of enhancing capabilities for incorporating health and
environmental issues in the comparative assessment of differ-
ent electricity generation chains and strategies (IAEA, 1995).
The DECADES project includes a technology inventory that
characterizes energy chains for electricity generation from fuel
extraction to waste management, as well as an information sys-
tem that provides user-oriented access to electronic databases.

"The International Energy Agency (IEA) has two related activi-
ties. The IEA established the Centre for the Analysis and
Dissemination of Demonstrated Energy Technologies (CAD-
DET), an Implementing Agreement that offers an international
network to exchange information on demonstrations of energy-
saving end-use technologies for all energy consumers (IEA,
1991). CADDET maintains The CADDET Register, a comput-
erized database providing information on international energy
demonstration projects. Also, the IEA has implemented the
Energy Technology Systems Analysis Programme (ETSAP),
an Implementing Agreement that also distributes technology
information to IEA member countries (IEA, 1992).

"Recovering gas from landfills reduces methane emissions and
allows the energy value of the recovered methane to be used
profitably. The recovery technologies are relatively straightfor-
ward: Gas wells are drilled into an area of disposed waste, and
collection systems are installed. These systems typically recov-
er 50-85% of the gas generated. The recovered gas is about
50% methane, a medium-Btu fuel. It typically requires some
processing to remove particulate matter, water, and corrosive
compounds. The costs of the technology depend on the costs
for recovery systems, labor, and utilization systems. Landfill
gas recovery provides additional benefits in the form of
reduced explosion hazard and protection of local air and water
quality. The best opportunities are for large waste-disposal
sites that have a nearby demand for medium-quality fuel.

"Compact fluorescent lights are three to.four times more energy
efficient than incandescent bulbs and last ten times as long.
They can therefore reduce the amount of electricity required to
deliver a given amount of lighting. The reduction in carbon
dioxide emissions will depend on the fuel used to generate the
electricity. Compact fluorescent units are available with screw-
in adaptors for use in incandescent lamp fixtures or as dedicat-
ed fixtures. Compact fluorescents also are available as inte-
grated lamp/ballast/adapter units; however, since the ballasts
typically outlive the lamps, integration of ballast and lamp
results in the ballast being discarded before the end of its use-
ful life. Lower wattage twin tubes cost about $5 per lamp. The
more luminous quad tubes cost about $9 per lamp. Integrated
units cost about $15-25 per lamp. Utility rebates in the range
of $4-15 per lamp typically are available in the U.S.
