Limitation and adaptation strategies must
be considered as an integrated package and
should complement each other to minimize
net costs. Strategies that limit greenhouse gas
emissions also make it easier to adapt to cli-
mate change.

The potentially serious consequences of cli-
mate change on the global environment give
sufficient reasons to begin by adopting re-
sponse strategies that can be justified imme-
diately even in the face of significant uncer-
tainties.

A well-informed population is essential to
promote awareness of the issues and provide
guidance on positive practices. The social,
economic, and cultural diversity of nations
will require tailored approaches.

"1) Climate change is a global issue; effective re-
sponses would require a global effort that may
have a considerable impact on humankind and
individual societies.

2) Industrialized countries and developing coun-
tries have a common responsibility in dealing
with problems arising from climate change.

3) Industrialized countries have specific respon-
siblities on two levels:

(a) a major part of emissions affecting the
atmosphere at present originates in indus-
trialized countries where the scope for
change is greatest. Industrialized countries
should adopt domestic measures to limit
climate change by adapting their own
economies in line with future agreements
to limit emissions;

(b) to cooperate with developing countries in
international action, without standing in
the way of the latter’s development, by
contributing additional financial __re-
sources, by appropriate transfer of tech-
nology, by engaging in close cooperation
concerning scientific observation, by
analysis and research, and finally by
means of technical cooperation geared to
forestalling and managing environmental
problems.

4) Emissions from developing countries are
growing and may need to grow in order to
meet their development requirements and
thus, over time, are likely to represent an in-
creasingly significant percentage of global
emissions. Developing countries have the re-
sponsibility, within the limits feasible, to take
measures to suitably adapt their economies.

concern for environmental protection as the
necessary basis for continuing economic
growth. Continuing economic development

the projections of greenhouse gas emissions, indi-

"One of the RSWG’s first tasks was to prepare some
initial scenarios of possible future greenhouse gas
emissions for the use of the three IPCC Working
Groups. An experts’ group was formed that looked
at four hypothetical future patterns of greenhouse
gas emissions and their effect on the atmosphere.
The cumulative effect of these emissions was calcu-
lated using the concept of equivalent CO, concen-
trations (¢.g., the contributions of all greenhouse
gases to radiative forcing are converted into their
equivalent in terms of CO, concentrations). Global
economic growth rates were taken from World
Bank projections, and population estimates were
taken from United Nations (UN) studies, and as-
sumed equal for all scenarios.

growth occurs in a manner that, globally, conserves
the environment for future generations. However,
there is no single, quick-fix technological option for

A general advantage of market based economic
instruments is that they encourage limitations or
reductions in emissions by those who can achieve
them at least cost. They also provide an ongoing
incentive for industry and individual consumers to
apply the most efficient limitation/reduction mea-
sures through, for example, more efficient and
cleaner technologies. Such incentives may be lack-

Economic instruments, through their encourage-
ment of flexible selection of abatement measures,
frequently offer the possibility of achieving envi-
ronmental improvements at lower cost than regula-
tory mechanisms. Unlike many regulations, they
tend to encourage innovation and the development
of improved technologies and practices for reducing
emissions. Economic mechanisms also have the po-
tential to provide the signals necessary for more
environmentally sensitive operation of markets. It
is unlikely, however, that economic instruments
will be applicable to all circumstances.

Three factors are considered as potential barriers
to the operation of markets and/or the achievement
of environmental objectives through market mecha-
nisms. These are: information problems, which can
often cause markets to produce less effective or un-
favorable environmental outcomes; existing mea-
sures and institutions, which can encourage indi-
viduals to behave in environmentally damaging
ways; and balancing competing objectives (social,
environmental, and economic). An initial response
strategy may therefore be to address information
problems directly and to review existing measures
that may be barriers. For example, prior to possible
adoption of a system of emission charges, countries
should examine existing subsidies and tax incentives
on energy and other relevant greenhouse gas pro-
ducing sectors.

* A system of tradeable emissions permits: An
emission permit system is based on the concept
that the economic costs of attaining a given
environmental goal can be minimized by allow-
ing for the trading of cmissions rights. Once an
overall limit on emissions has been set, emis-
sions entitlements amounting to that limit
could be provided to emitting sources and free
trading of such entitlements allowed. This
would reduce the costs of meeting a given emis-
sion target because: (a) as in trade, comparative
advantages between trading entities would be
maximized; and (b) economic incentives would
be created for the development of improved
greenhouse gas limitation technologies, sink
enhancement, and resource use efficiency (en-
ergy conservation), Concerns with this ap-
proach include the limited experience with this
instrument, the potential scope and size of trad-
ing markets, and the need for the development
of an administrative structure not currently in

+ A system of emission charges: Emission charges
are levied on specified emissions depending on
their level of contribution to climate change.
Such changes may provide a means of encour-
aging emitters to limit or reduce emissions and
provide an incentive for diverse parties to im-
plement efficient means of limiting or reducing
emissions. Another advantage of charges is that
they generate revenue that could provide a
funding base for further pollution abatement,
research, and administration, or allow other
taxes to be lowered. Concerns with this ap-
proach include the difficulty of deciding on the
basis and size of the tax, and the lack of cer-
tainty that the tax will achieve the agreed emis-
sion reduction target.

the World Bank, a number of regional banks,
other multilateral organizations, and bilateral

grammes. Bilateral donors could further inte-

The coordinators’ report has as its primary
objective the compilation of elements that
might be included in a future framework Con-

of the issues that are likely to arise in the
context of developing those elements.

There is a general view that while existing legal
instruments and institutions with a bearing on
climate should be fully utilized and further
strengthened, they are insufficient alone to
meet the challenge. A very broad international
consensus has therefore emerged in the IPCC,
confirmed notably at the 44th United Nations
General Assembly, on the need for a frame-
work Convention on Climate Change. Such a
Convention should generally follow the for-
mat of the Vienna Convention for the Protec-

minimum, general principles and obligations.
It should further be framed in such a way as to
gain the adherence of the largest possible num-
ber and most suitably balanced spread of
countries while permitting timely action to be
taken; it should contain provision for separate
annexes/protocols to deal with specific obliga-

The latter of these Working Groups, the Re-

first meeting in Washington in January 1989 under
the chairmanship of Dr. Frederick M. Bernthal of
the United States. RSWG Vice-Chairs were also
named from Canada, China, Malta, the Nether-

RSWG established a Steering Committee and four
Subgroups to carry out a work plan for formulating
response strategies (see Figure 1.1). The RSWG
Steering Committee was given responsibility for co-
ordinating the Working Group’s activities in gen-
eral and for specifically addressing two cross-
cutting tasks: (1) the development of greenhouse gas
emissions scenarios; and (2) the development of a
strategy for considering implementation mecha-
nisms. The four RSWG Subgroups were tasked
with developing a range of climate change response
strategies in the areas of: (1) Energy and Industry;
(2) Agriculture and Forestry; (3) Coastal Zone
Management; and (4) Resource Use and Manage-
ment. It was agreed that the first two subgroups
would consider measures for limiting net green-
house gas emissions from the energy, industry, ag-
riculture, and forestry sectors, and that the latter
two subgroups would deal with measures for adapt-
ing to the impacts of climate change on coastal re-

impact of these emissions on atmospheric concen-

total. The impacts range from rapid increases in
atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases
throughout the next century in one scenario to de-
clines in the rate of growth in atmospheric concen-
trations eventually leading to stabilization by early
next century in another scenario. Significant policy
changes would be required to achieve the latter sce-

Montreal Protocol is strengthened to include a full

policies yield reduction in emissions of greenhouse
gases from enteric fermentation in domestic ani-
mals, from rice paddies, and from fertilizer. As a
result, emissions of CO,, N,O, and CH, grow
slowly through the middle of the next century, then
start to decline. Emissions of CO and NO, decline
sharply along with emissions of CFCs. These emis-

"In summary, ‘the 2030 High Emissions and 2060
Low Emissions scenarios may be viewed as two
different paths that global greenhouse gas emis-
sions could follow over the next several decades.
The latter case assumes sizeable improvements in
energy efficiency, which may only be possible with
government action, The Control Policies and Ac-
celerated Policies scenarios require deliberate ac-
tions by governments (¢.g., phasing out of CFCs,
increasing fossil energy prices or using other mea-
sures to ensure penetration by renewables). In gen-
eral, these scenarios do not achieve the goals of
the Toronto Conference “The Changing Atmo-
sphere—1988,” which is a 20 percent reduction in
CO, emissions by early in the next century. This
goal is achieved in the Alternative Accelerated Pol-
icy scenario submitted by the Netherlands. The
economic implications of all of the scenarios have
not been analyzed.

An expert group developed these three scenarios
and a draft report and presented them to the RSWG
in May 1989. Later, at the general [PCC meeting in
June 1989 in Nairobi, the group decided to add a
fourth scenario that would lead to stabilization of
greenhouse gas concentrations at CO, equivalent
levels well below the CO, doubling level. In addi-
tion, Working Group I requested some changes in
the initial three scenarios and the expert group de-
cided to provide an alternative fourth scenario that
was quite similar to the newly adopted fourth sce-
nario, but which featured lower estimates of carbon

very different possible futures. RSWG has con-
structed these scenarios through a process of identi-

sources of emissions, identifying the key factors
that are likely to influence future emissions from
these sources, making different sets of assumptions
about how these factors may change in the future,
and then estimating the impact of these combined
changes on emissions. The resulting scenarios mect
the needs of Working Group I by providing emis-
sions estimates that behave according to specifica-
tions, consistent with a world that is evolving in a

To account for the wide range of impacts on
greenhouse warming from the different greenhouse
gases the expert group used the concept of equiva-
lent CO, concentration to define the scenarios.
Equivalent CO, concentration, or the concentra-
tion equivalent to a specified atmospheric concen-
tration of CO,, is defined as the concentration of
CO, that, by itself, would produce the increase
in direct radiative forcing produced by all of the
greenhouse gases. Equivalent CO, concentration
is derived by first estimating the increase, over
pre-industrial levels, in direct radiative forcing from
all of the greenhouse gases and then calculating
the concentration of CO, that would produce the
same increase, assuming atmospheric concentra-
tions of all other grcenhouse gases stayed at pre-
industrial levels.

Estimates of current emissions of CO, from fossil
fuel combustion and cement production are from
Marland et al. (1988), and emissions of CO, from
tropical deforestation are from Houghton (1988).
For 1985, these sources estimate emissions of 5.2

bustion, 0.1 Pg C from cement manufacturing, and

"A great deal of uncertainty surrounds the estimates
of many of the greenhouse gas emissions. This un-

or inconsistent measurements of emissions, as well
as a lack of information on activities that cause emis-

the amount of biomass burned as a result of the
clearing. The level of uncertainty varies consider-
ably by gas and by emission source. Emissions of
CO, from the combustion of fossil fuels are esti-
mated within an error of plus or minus 10 percent
(Marland and Rotty, 1984), while high and low
estimates of emissions of NO from fertilizer (in-
cluding leaching) can vary by a factor of 4 (Bolle et

The use of the assumptions for the different emis-
sion scenarios is straightforward. The Carbon-
intensive energy supply assumptions are used to
construct the 2030 High Emissions scenarios. The
Gas-intensive assumptions are used for the 2060
Low Emissions scenarios. The Non-Fossil-inten-

The Gas-intensive assumptions are similar to the
Carbon-intensive assumptions except that increased
use of natural gas is encouraged in order to meet a
number of environmental goals, including reducing
CO, emissions. Carbon fees of 20 to 25 percent of
delivered prices help reduce demand for oil and coal
and help provide price subsidies for natural gas of
up to 15 percent. Research and development help
accelerate reductions in gas exploration and produc-

tion costs on the order of 0.5 percent annually.

hydrohalocarbons (including CFCs). The first of
the assumptions, labeled Protocol/Low Compli-

further control emissions of CFCs. They include no
strengthening of the Montreal Protocol and only 85
percent participation by developing countries. The
second set of assumptions, labeled Protocol/Full
Compliance, still represents a pessimistic view, in
that there is no strengthening of the Montreal Pro-
tocol, but all countries participate and there is 100
percent compliance to the existing terms. The third
set of assumptions (Phase Out) represents an opti-
mistic view of efforts to strengthen the Montreal
Protocol; these assumptions include a complete
phase-out of CFCs by the year 2000 and limits on
emissions of carbon tetrachloride and methyl-
chloroform, as well as 100 percent participation in

earlier, two alternative detailed scenarios provide

bined to create an Average Scenario for each
requested emission profile. An additional scenario
provides an alternative view of how stabilization of
greenhouse gas concentrations can be achieved.

Both the ASF and IMAGE were used to estimate
changes in atmospheric concentrations of the green-
house gases in order to confirm that they met the
specifications of the four emission scenarios. The
results of the ASF and IMAGE were within 5 per-
cent, with variations due primarily to the use of
different approaches to estimate atmospheric con-
centrations of the greenhouse gases and a different
conceptual approach to the modeling of land-use
changes. Figure 2.2 displays CO, concentrations
and equivalent CO, concentrations estimated by the
Atmospheric Stabilization Framework for the four

Two separate sets of assumptions are made con-
cerning future emissions from these activities. The
first set, labeled Current Factors, assumes that
emissions coefficients from agricultural activities re-
main constant over time. As examples, the percent
of N applied as fertilizer that evolves as N,O would
remain constant in the future, and CH, emissions
from a single hectare of land cultivated for rice pro-
duction would also remain constant. The second set
of assumptions (Declining Factors) has the emission
coefficients declining 0.5 percent annually as a re-
sult of efforts to control emissions, for example, by
changing types of fertilizer and methods of applica-
tion, by altering rice cultivation practices and rice
cultivars, and by adopting meat and dairy produc-
tion techniques such as methane-inhibiting iono-
phores. Examples of Current Factor coefficients,
used in the 2030 High Emissions and 2060 Low
Emissions scenarios, are shown in Table 2.7. De-

growth, primary energy supply increases from a
1985 level of 290 EJ to 660 EJ in 2025 (an annual
growth rate of 2.1 percent) and reaches 1680 EJ in
2100 (an annual growth rate of 1.3 percent). Oil and

Coal becomes the dominant fuel; its share of pri-

period. By 2100, half of all coal mined is used in
synthetic fuel production. With lower economic

different CO, pathways be shown by estimating
and graphing three parameters for each scenario:
GNP, Energy/GNP, CO,/Energy. These values
for all nine scenarios are presented in Figures 2.9,
2.10, and 2.11; Figure 2.9 shows global GNP, Fig-
ure 2.10, energy/GNP, and Figure 2.11, CO,/unit
energy. Although the scenarios are believed to be
technically feasible, the economic implications of
these changes should be explored in the national
analyses being performed by participating countries
in RSWG. Also, it should be noted that the assumed
levels of long run economic growth may not repre-
sent accurate measures of human welfare, especially
in the developed countries.

one of the most powerful determinants of the rate of
greenhouse gas emissions, it is by no means the only
determinant. Other important factors can poten-
tially offset the association between higher eco~
nomic growth and higher rates of greenhouse gas
emissions. For example, a higher rate of economic
growth makes it possible for capital stocks (c.g.,
power plants, factories, housing) to be refurbished
or replaced more quickly, and makes the accelerated
penetration of advanced technologics possible. Sim-
ilarly, under slow economic growth an increase in
deforestation may be more likely because of a lack
of other economic opportunities. The alternative
scenarios were constructed with these factors in
mind.

"unfold. At every step in the development of sce-

construct emission scenarios that would result in
similar equivalent CO, concentrations assuming ei-
ther high or low rates of economic growth, a high
percentage of CO, emissions, or a high percentage
of emissions of other greenhouse gases, that energy
intensity reductions (due to technological change)
increase end-use energy efficiency, that non-fossil
energy supplies (e.g., renewable or nuclear) are sub-
stituted for fossil fuels, and that lifestyle changes
alter the composition of final demand. Alternative
scenarios could have been constructed with greater
emphasis on the role of such factors as the amounts
and modes of travel, the size of buildings, and the
composition of industrial and agricultural output,
for example.

"The expert group responded only to the criteria
established by Working Group I and RSWG to
construct the reference scenarios. Other studies
have suggested alternatives. Conclusions reached
by the Bellagio Workshop (Jaeger, 1988) suggested
that an ecological goal of a 0.1 degree C temperature
increase per decade might be desirable. The Brunt-
land Commission emphasized the need for sustain-
able development and mentioned the desirability of
a 50 percent reduction in primary energy consump-
tion in industrialized countries by 2030, and the
Toronto Conference, “The Changing Atmo-
sphere—1988,” suggested additional short-term
emission reduction goals. The expert group did not
attempt to analyze these alternatives. It should be
noted that for the Accelerated Policies scenarios,
primary energy use in industrialized countries stays
relatively flat through 2025, as do global CO, emis-
sions from the commercial energy sector. In the
future it may be desirable to compare the results of
these global analyscs with results from studies using

"The expert group recognized that emissions and
concentrations in the future are not only a function
of factors such as economic growth and technologi-
cal change, but also of when measures to reduce
emissions are adopted. To explore this issue, a pre-
liminary sensitivity analysis was undertaken using
IMAGE. In this analysis stable atmospheric con-
centrations equivalent to a doubling of CO, by the
year 2090 were used as a target. The simulations
utilized the emissions estimates from the 2030 High
Emissions (Average) scenario, but modified the
emissions at different points in time (2000, 2010,
2020, and 2030) in order to achieve the goal of
keeping greenhouse gas concentrations from dou-
bling. In all cases, CO, emissions have to decline in
order to achieve stable concentrations at the
2xCO),-equivalent level in 2090, but Figures 2.12
and 2.13 clearly show that emissions would have to
be curtailed sharply if the emissions reduction mea-
sures are delayed until a later date. For example, if
emissions reduction measures are begun in 2000, a
gradual 17 percent reduction in CO, emissions
(from 2000 levels) is sufficient to meet the targeted
concentrations. If measures are not implemented
until 2020, however, the model calculates that a
reduction of 60 percent (from 2020 levels) is neces-
sary to achieve the targets.

for national, regional and international responses to
the possibility of climate change from greenhouse
gas emissions produced by energy production, con-

sider greenhouse gases (GHGs), primarily carbon
dioxide (CO,), methane (CH,), and nitrous oxide
(N,O) and “define technology and policy options
to attempt to reduce emissions of these gases to a
level consistent with, or below, emission scenarios
defined by the Steering Group (of RSWG).” It was
to concentrate on options which could be ade-
quately assessed within eighteen months and also
consider those that may require a longer time frame.

sidering the social, economic and environmental

* First, the nature of the problem varies signifi-
cantly depending on each country’s economic
structure, the situation of its energy sector, and
its stage of development. The national case
studies showed that economic growth and re-
ductions from the reference case in the growth
of greenhouse gases can co-exist and that poli-
cies and technologies can make a substantial
contribution to limiting GHGs.

+ Second, there is no single quick-fix technologi-
cal option; improving efficiency on both the
demand and supply side should be a priority;
technological solutions must be cost effective;
non-economic barriers to diffusion of attractive
technologies were a fruitful area for further
analysis; and technological research and devel-
opment was a prime arca for international co-
operation. Overall, there was a consistent
emphasis on energy efficiency and conserva-

of different gases varies considerably depending on

from coal mines and oil and gas facilities. In 1985,
approximately 5.3 billion tonnes of CO, as carbon
(BTC) were released from fossil fuel combustion,
and 50-95 million tonnes (MT) of CH, were re-
leased due to fossil fuel production and consump-
tion. Another source of greenhouse gas emissions is
solid waste landfill, which produces CH,. Addi-

produces CH, and when not based on sustainable

"Substantial technical potential exists for fuel substi-
tution through the use of fuels derived from natural
gas and of ethanol or other fuels derived from bio-
mass. Substantial technical potential also exists for
electric or hydrogen- fueled vehicles, which could
also reduce emissions with appropriate primary en-
ergy sources. Presently, the economic and market
potentials of most of these options are very low
because petroleum fuels are relatively cheap, alter-
native non-CO,-producing fuels are relatively
costly, and some alternative vehicular technologies
have performance drawbacks. The technical poten-
tial for vehicle efficiency improvements is very high
despite the substantial improvements already made.
Economic and market potentials are constrained by
replacement rates of vehicles, consumer demand
and preference for larger, more powerful and
better-equipped cars, and higher incremental costs.
Improved driver behavior, vehicle maintenance,
traffic management, and promotion of public trans-
portation could also reduce CO, emissions.

"The technical potential for energy efficiency gains in
the residential and commercial sectors is also sub-
stantial. Space conditioning energy requirements in
new homes could be roughly half of the current
average for new homes. The technical potential for
retrofits could average 25 percent. Reductions of
energy use in existing commercial buildings by at
least 50 percent may be technically feasible, and new
commercial buildings could be up to 75 percent
more efficient than existing commercial buildings.
However, market potential is lower and depends on
the replacement rate. The realization of significant
gains in this scctor requires the involvement of gov-
ernment, the many concerned institutions, and ulti-
mately the individual residential or commercial
consumers. This sector therefore requires special
efforts in order to achieve desired levels of market
penetration of energy efficient technologies. For
these technologies to achieve their market potential,

The technical potential for greater efficiency in gen-

substitution could achieve CO, reduction in CO,
emissions from electrical generation in the range of
30 percent (from oil to natural gas) to 100 percent
(from fossil fuel to non-fossil fuel). The electricity
sector has a potential to substantially increase its
efficiency where cogeneration of electricity and heat
or combined cycle power generation can be applied.
The economic potential for greater fuel efficiency is
considerably lower and for substitution from coal
or oil to natural gas or non-fossil fuel is critically
dependent on the relative prices and availability of
the fuels in question. In evaluating switching be-
tween fossil fuels it is necessary to account for any
potential increases in methane emissions from pro-
duction and transmission of the fuels in calculating
the net benefit of such strategies. Overall, efficiency
of the electricity system can be improved through
the use of least cost utility planning. The goal of
least cost utility planning is to meet energy-service
requirements through the least cost combination of
supply additions and demand management.

An area of high priority is to assess the fea-
sibility of different targets and strategies for
limiting climate change and their costs, bene-
fits and effectiveness, Such assessments should
take a full fuel cycle approach and consider
trade-offs among all greenhouse gases. Sec-
ondary effects should also be considered.

There is an urgent need to improve the data
available from the developing and East Euro-
pean countries and for additional studies in the
future, through the participation of a larger
number of countries in the EJS.

No single analytical tool or model is sufficient
to analyze the many issues discussed in this
report. A broad set of tools ranging from mac-
roeconomic models, technology assessment
tools, and policy models of specific sectors—
e.g., the transportation, utilities, and resi-

There is an important need to collaborate on

national and global energy-related emission

itoring and evaluating energy-related green-

as accounting for greenhouse gas emissions
from bunkers, non-energy fuel use and energy

The amount of carbon presently stored in forests
is equivalent to about the amount in the atmo-

a global average between 100 and 200 tonnes of

Deforestation contributes between 0.4 and 2.8
billion tonnes of carbon (BTC), and biomass burn-
ing (forests, savanna, and shrub-fallow) between 20
and 80 million tonnes (MT) methane per year. The
scientists who addressed the IPCC Tropical Forest
Workshop, Sao Paulo, Brazil, January 1990 were
reasonably certain that in 1980 emissions were be-
tween 1.0 and 2.0 billion tonnes of carbon (BTC),
and in 1989 emissions were between 2.0 and

cultivars, efficient use of fertilizers, and other
management practices could lead to a 10-30
percent reduction in methane emissions from
flooded rice cultivation, although substantial
research is necessary to develop and demon-

Forestry policies can be identified which could
contribute to a global warming response strategy.
In this context, reducing current deforestation and
forest degradation should be a first priority. It is
also vital to make a contribution to the reduction of
the man-made increase in the greenhouse effect by
making greater use of wood. The partial replace-

the emission of additional CO,. Wood in competi-

whose production requires many times more en-

area necded to balance deforestation (according to

10 million ha per year. Such an area could store up

Afforestation costs are highly dependent on the
specific area, the tree species and local wages. A
rough global estimate ranges from U.S. $200 to
$2,000 per hectare, Detailed studies are needed to
obtain more reliable figures; costs and carbon diox-
ide reduction figures obtainable by afforestation
should also be compared with other measures possi-
ble in industrialized countries—for example, en-
ergy sector counter-measures. However, this in no
way limits the usefulness of conservation measures.
The amount of afforestation required to balance
total anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions—
7-8 billion tonnes—would be about 1 billion ha,
or an area the size of Europe from the Atlantic
to the Urals. Afforestation on such scale is imprac-
ticable, so that forestry measures can play only a
minor but significant contributory role in reduc-
ing the buildup of greenhouse gases. It might be
realistic to achieve a 10~15 percent reduction
of such emissions. This role is small in comparison
to the potential emissions of CO, implicd by a
continuing (and even increasing) global reliance on
fossil fuels.

carbon dioxide. Extension of rotation periods may
be possible in managed forests. An alternative
would be to grow trees for shorter rotations than at

carbon could be stored in the end product. Mate-

carbon cycle because it returns carbon to the atmo-

occurrence of wildfires has increased dramatically

maintain healthy fisheries and water supplies, and
prevent soil erosion, dam siltation, and flash flood-

the health of tropical forests. Deforestation may be
responsible for one-quarter to one-fifth of global
anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, one to
four-tenths of all (natural and anthropogenic) meth-

of nitrous oxides, ozone, carbon monoxide, and
other gases implicated in global warming. Region-

cover can cause drying of the microclimate, leading
to an increase in natural fires that prevent natural

in 1990 are subject to debate. One recent, but un-

1989 the rate of clearing of closed tropical moist

land conversion for agriculture and pasture; wood
removals for fuelwood and inappropriate timber
utilization; and public and private development
projects (e.g., logging, mining, roads and dams—

and land use conflicts are associated with natural

Tropical forests and plantations supply about 10
percent of the world’s demand for timber and pulp.
Logging for timber occurs mainly in closed forests
of the humid tropics. By the early 1980s about 13.25
percent of humid tropical forests had been logged.
Commercially valuable species account for less than
10 percent by volume of tropical forests, so logging
in the tropics is mostly selective over extensive
areas. Only 2-10 commercially valuable trees are
removed per hectare, but as many as 30-70 percent
of the remaining trees are left damaged. If forests are
allowed to regenerate, the net flux of carbon from
selective logging may be near zero. Destructive log-
ging practices, however, may damage forest pro-
ductivity and slow regeneration. If logged areas are
subsequently colonized and used as croplands, as
happens in many African and Asian countries, the
net effect is a loss of carbon from the land. Logging
is expected to increase with growing timber demand
in the future.

A wide variety of afforestation options could be
pursued on a global basis. For example, three sce-
narios of replanting evaluated by Grainger (1989b)
include planting 6 million ha/ycar over 10 years, 8
million ha/year over 20 years, or 10 million ha/year
over 30 years to offset 5 percent, 13 percent, or 26
percent of the 5.5 BTC currently released from
burning fossil fuels annually (Table 4.6). The esti-
mated costs total $2.4, $3.0 or $4.0 billion per year,
respectively (Table 4.7). Options trading-off time
and money to reach specific planting targets are
presented in ‘Table 4.7. The shorter the time-frame
to reach a given level of planting and carbon uptake,
the higher the annual cost of planting. The 13 per-
cent reduction scenario achieved over 20 years
would lead to an additional annual harvest of 2.6
billion cubic meters, which would allow global for-
est production to meet the anticipated demand for
wood in 2030 (Grainger, 1989b).

SAO PAULO WORKSHOP SESSIONS

a)

Increase Support for Tropical Forestry Action
Plan (TEAP).

TFAP offers the framework within which na-
tional plans for heightened forest management
can be developed. Priorities within the TFAP
could be reviewed by member countries and
FAO to consider how they can be strength-
ened to address climate change concerns.
Meeting resource needs for TFAP should be a
priority,

International Tropical Timber Organization

(TTO),

Consideration should be given to strengthen-

ing the role of ITTO to develop international

guidelines to encourage:

* sustainable forest management techniques,
including national legislation requiring man-
agement of forest for sustained wood pro-
duction;

* an assessment of incentives for sustainable
forest management including the feasibility

of labeling.

Development Assistance Organizations and

Development Banks.

The development banks—IMF, FAO,

UNEP—and other multilateral or bilateral in-

ternational organizations could help tropical

forest countries achieve conservation and sus-
tainable development of forests by:

* requiring analyses of climate change impli-
cations, potential greenhouse gas emissions,
and forestry response programmes in their
review of project proposals;

* expanding greatly aid and investment flows
to forestry;

change. Potential institutional initiatives
could include:

+ adding forestry and climate research and de-
velopment programmes to the CGIAR sys-
tem (Consultative Group on International
Agricultural Research), at least one on each
major tropical continent, to conduct and
disseminate research results and beneficial
field practice guidelines to foresters re-

"Agriculture contributes to the emissions of green-
house gases through the following practices:
flooded rice cultivation, nitrogen fertilizer use, ru-

conversion, and biomass burning. The appendix to
this section illustrates the level of emissions and
agricultural activities on a country by country basis.
Globally, rice cultivation, ruminant animals, and
biomass burning are estimated to contribute ap-
proximately 15, 9, and 8 percent respectively, of
total methane production; methane, in turn, ac-
counts for about 20 percent of current greenhouse

the current global source of nitrous oxide, nitrous
oxide representing 5 percent of current greenhouse

contribute between 10 and 30 percent of current
greenhouse gases, contributing to increases in emis-
sions of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxides,

sources are expected to increase substantially over
the next several decades due to population and eco-

Fertilizer-derived emissions of nitrous oxide
potentially can be reduced (although to what

Trace gas emissions from biomass burning,

management of water systems, cultivar develop-

of methane are perhaps best characterized and esti-
mated. They are dominated by rice and livestock
production, with a potentially large, but uncertain
percentage from biomass burning. Methane contri-
butions from burning are estimated at 20-80 million
tonnes per year, or 5-13 percent of the total meth-
ane emissions, There is less certainty regarding the
emission of carbon dioxide from agriculture, and
the relative contribution of each of the major
sources; land-use conversion, biomass burning,

are in the area of nitrous oxide emissions, although
initial estimates are of 5-15 percent of the global

Diet modification for intensively managed ani-

emissions vary under different dicts. Increasing
the intake of animals and modifying the compo-
sition of their diet can reduce emissions per unit
of product. Other feed inputs such as whole
cotton seeds or polyunsaturated fats also appear
to have promising impacts on methane emis-
sions levels. Modifying feeding practices could
potentially reduce methane emissions by large
amounts in certain circumstances, However,
size and location of animal populations for
which this is a promising alternative must be
identified.

Reduction of protozoa. Recent studies indicate
that reduced protozoa in ruminant digestive
systems results in lower methane emissions and
may enhance animal productivity. Further
promising avenues consist of improvements in
reproductive efficiency, which lead to smaller
brood herd requirements and microbiological
approaches to improved digestion processes.
Again, these technologies and practices must be
further developed, demonstrated, and assessed
in terms of costs, reductions, and other poten-
tial benefits. Also, techniques for field level
measurements of methane from livestock need

"tainty in the soil-carbon relationships involved in
tillage practices and residue management. In tem-
perate and boreal agricultural systems, soil carbon
can usually be increased or decreased by about 20
percent from the existing continuous arable state
when large amounts of organic matter are not
added; thus these agricultural soils are not a signifi-
cant carbon sink. Furthermore, cutbacks in nitro-
gen inputs from any source may reduce biomass
accumulation and annual carbon sequestration. Use
of crop rotation with organic matter amendments
can increase or maintain soil equilibrium levels of
organic carbon. However, in temperate and boreal
agricultural systems the effect is very small relative
to that which takes place in the conversion to grass-
land or forest ecosystems. An estimated 25 percent
of the global soil carbon is contained in boreal forest
soils, and significant amounts of this carbon will be
lost if the lands overlying these soils are converted
to agricultural usc. In addition, drainage of peat
bogs and boreal muskegs would release more ni-
trous oxides and carbon dioxide as water tables
drop, while maintaining high water tables in these
systems would relcase more methane.

conditions exist in most landfill sites and in most

landfill sites, the following assumptions have been
used; Specific waste generation in developed coun-

developing countries it is approximately 0.5 kg per
capita and day, Methane generation in developed
countries is estimated to be 86 kg methane per met-

kg per tonne of waste. Disposal of domestic and
commercial waste on landfill sites takes place
mainly in urban centers. In rural areas, particularly
in developing countries, waste disposal does not
take place on large centralized landfills with anaer-

therefore may affect the economic basis of some
countries, especially developing countries. Ef-
forts to prevent deforestation and to promote
afforestation will have multiple impacts that in
many cases may enhance the abilities of indige-
nous agricultural communities to feed them-
selves and to earn a living from local surplus.
Flexibility should be provided to governments
to develop least-cost implementation strategies,
and countries should pursue those options that
increase productivity, make economic sense,
and are beneficial for other reasons.
Agriculture and forestry sources of greenhouse
gas emissions consist of very large numbers of
small sources, and/or of diffuse sources from
large land areas, and as such represent a major
challenge.

To meet this challenge it is desirable to consider
a range of measures in the context of a compre-
hensive response strategy. Currently available
options in the sectors are likely to be only par-
tially effective unless coupled with action to
reduce emissions from the energy and industry
sector.

Controls on existing sources of pollution which
may affect agricultural and forestry lands are an
important component in reducing emissions
and protecting sinks. Measures to prevent land
degradation, hydrological problems and loss of
biodiversity, and to improve productivity will
generally complement efforts in this sector.
Furthermore, analysis is needed about the costs
and benefits of individual policy measures.
There is an urgent need to improve all relevant
data, especially on deforestation rates and on
the socio-economic factors that lead to the use
of deleterious practices in agriculture and for-
estry. In order to achieve the full potential of
identified measures, research is needed into the
routes by which new technologies can be intro-
duced while preserving and enhancing social
and economic development.

In the past, the agriculture and forestry sector
has proved efficient at introducing new meth-
ods of production, not always with beneficial
environmental consequences. The pace of tech-

DEFORESTATION OF ALL TROPICAL FORESTS, 1980-2050;
Two BASE CASE PROJECTIONS OF INCREASING CARBON

EMISSIONS AND TWO POLICY OPTION CASES FOR
DECREASING CARBON EMISSIONS
"	Title
" 

Policy Option Cases (Grainger, 1989a): Decreased forestation and cmisstons are expected to result from increases in agricultural productivity that
relieve pressure to clear new land. Increases in productivity are adjusted for changes in per capita consumption for a net gain, In the high case, net
agricultural productivity per ha rises by 0.5%, 0.0% and 0.5% per year for Africa, Asia-Pacific and Jatin America respectively; and by 1.0%, 0.0%
and 1.0% per year respectively, in low case scenatio. Biomass estimates are the same in both cases, based on “volume over bark” estimates FAO
(1981) and procedures of Brown and Lugo (984).

Base Cases (Houghton, 1990b): Increased deforestation ts forecast, The low base case assumes low forest biomass estimates (roughly) comparable to
Grainger’s biomass assumptions) and linear increases in the rate of deforestation. The high base case assumes high forest biomass and population
based deforestation rates. The biomass estimates arc outlined in Houghton et al., 1985.

"These low and high base case projections repre-

emissions possible in models of linear, exponential,
and population based deforestation rates, run with
both high and low forest biomass estimates. The
low base case uses linear deforestation rates re-
ported by FAO/UNEP (1981) for the years 1975~
85, coupled with low forest biomass estimates. The
high base case uses rates of deforestation that are a
function of rates of population growth, coupled

directly comparable with the EIS data. ‘They are,
however, basically interchangeable with the esti-

"Thus, projected fluxes drop to zero only when
the forests of an entire region are gone. In fact,
some countries will eliminate their forests be-
fore others, and fluxes there will drop to zero
before all forests in the region are gone. If the
projections were carried out country-by-
country, the estimates of flux, for countries as
well as regions, would probably be lower.

All estimates of flux are based on extrapola-
tions or functions of FAO/UNEP data that
are now more than tcn years old. It is, there-
fore, interesting to compare these projections
with estimates of flux from Myers’ new rates
of deforestation. Such a comparison can be
done for closed forests only, but if Myers’
recent estimates are correct, all the projections
are low.

Some nations are particularly vulnerable. Eight to
ten million people live within one meter of high tide
in each of the unprotected river deltas of Ban-
gladesh, Egypt, and Vietnam. Half a million people
live in archipelagoes and coral atoll nations that lie
almost entirely within three meters of sea level, such
as the Maldives, the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu,
Kiribati, and Tokelau. Other archipelagoes and is-
land nations in the Pacific, Indian Ocean, and Ca-

lands, which would cause severe economic and so-

"The responses required to protect human life and
property fall broadly into three categories: retreat,
accommodation, and protection. Retreat involves
no effort to protect the land from the sea. The
coastal zone is abandoned and ecosystems shift
landward. This choice can be motivated by exces-
sive economic or environmental impacts of protec-
tion. In the extreme case, an entire area may be
abandoned. Accommodation implies that people
continue to use the land at risk but do not attempt to
prevent the land from being flooded. This option
includes erecting emergency flood shelters, elevat-
ing buildings on piles, converting agriculture to fish
farming, or growing flood- or salt-tolerant crops.

Protective structures should be designed—as
much as possible—to avoid adverse environmental
impacts. Artificial reefs can create new habitats for
marine species, and dams can mitigate saltwater in-
trusion, though sometimes at the cost of adverse
environmental impacts elsewhere. Soft solutions
such as beach nourishment retain natural shore-

"Two-thirds of the world’s fish catch, and many
marine species, depend on coastal wetlands for their
survival. Without human interference, (the retreat
option), ccosystems could migrate landward as
sea level rises, and thus could remain largely in-
tact, although the total area of wetlands would de-
cline. Under the protection option, a much larger
proportion of these ecosystems would be lost,
especially if hard structures block their landward
migration.

The appropriate mechanism for implementation
depends on the particular response. Assuming that
land for settlement is available, retreat can be imple-
mented through anticipatory land-use regulations,
building codes, or economic incentives. Accom-
modation may evolve without governmental action,
but could be assisted by strengthening flood prepa-
ration and flood insurance programmes. Protection
can be implemented by the authorities currently
responsible for water resources and coastal protec-
tion.

economic impacts of climate change. In the retreat
option, coastal landowners and communities would
suffer from loss of property, resettlement costs, and

for modifying infrastructure. Under the protection

costs of the necessary structures. The structures

meter, about 360,000 kilometers of coastal defenses
would be required at a total cost of U.S.$500 billion
by the year 2100. (This sum only reflects the mar-
ginal or added costs and is not discounted.) This
value docs not include costs necessary to meet pres-
ent coastal defense needs. The estimate does not
include the value of the unprotected dry land or
ecosystems that would be lost, nor does it consider
the costs of responding to saltwater intrusion or the
impacts of increased storm frequency. Therefore
the overall cost will be considerably higher. Al-

costs, other nations—including many small island

"Improving scientific and public understanding of
the problem is also a critical component of any
response strategy. The highest prioritics for basic
research are better projections of changes in the rate
of sea level rise, precipitation, and the frequency
and intensity of storms. Equally important, but
more often overlooked, is the need for applied re-
search to determine which options are warranted,
given current information. Finally, the available in-
formation on coastal land elevation is poor. Maps
for most nations only show contours of five meters
or greater, making it difficult to determine the areas
and resources vulnerable to impacts of a one-meter
rise in sea level. Except for a few countries, there are
no reliable data from which to determine how many
people and how much development are at risk.

plans. These plans should deal with both sea
level rise and other impacts of global climate
change. They should ensure that risks to pop-
ulations are minimized, while recognizing the
need to protect and maintain important
coastal ecosystems.

Coastal areas at risk should be identified.
National efforts should be undertaken to (a)
identify functions and resources at risk from a
one-meter rise in sea level and (b) assess the
implications of adaptive response measures on
them. Improved mapping will be vital for
completing this task.

Nations should ensure that coastal develop-

Research on the impacts of global climate
change on sea level rise should be strength-
ened. International and national climate re-
search programmes need to be directed at
understanding and predicting changes in sea
level, extreme events, precipitation, and
other impacts of global climate change on
coastal areas.

A global ocean-observing network should be
developed and implemented. Member na-
tions are strongly encouraged to support the
efforts of the IOC, WMO, and UNEP to
establish a coordinated international ocean-
observing network that will allow for accu-
rate assessments and continuous monitoring
of changes in the world’s oceans and coastal
areas, particularly sea level change.

Data and information on sea level change
and adaptive options should be made widely
available. An international mechanism
should be identified with the participation of
the parties concerned for collecting and ex-
changing data and information on climate
change and its impact on sea level and the
coastal zone, and on various adaptive op-
tions. Sharing this information with develop-~
ing countries is critically important for
preparation of coastal manavement plans.

In general, the effects on shallow coastal ecosys-
tems are strongly determined by local conditions. A
good understanding of the physical and biological
processes and topography is required to forecast
local impacts. But if the accumulation of sediments
cannot keep pace with rising waters, or if inland
expansion of wetlands and intertidal areas is not
possible!° (because of infrastructure or a steeply

The estuarine response to rising sea level is likely
to be characterized by a slow but continually adjust-
ing environment. With a change in estuarine vegeta~
tion there could be an adjustment in the animal
species living in and around the wetlands. Climate
change may also provoke shifts in the hydrological
regimes of coastal rivers and lead to increased dis-

increased turbidity. These changes, together with a
rise in sea level, could modify the shape and location
of banks and channels, If no protective structures
are built, wetlands can migrate inland; however, a

The lifestyles of many people a are tied directly to
the coast and its predominant local features. The
coast also features strongly in the mythology of
many cultures. Numerous places of particular cul-
tural significance are situated on the coast, and
many people in developed and developing nations
view the sea, coasts, reefs, and beaches as central to
their lives.

Social and cultural implications of adaptive op-
tions are likely to vary considerably from country
to country and from site to site. Options that are
socially and culturally beneficial in some situations
may be less desirable in others. It is particularly
important that the affected communities are con-
sulted and participate in the decisions to adopt par-
ticular options. This is probably one of the best
means available to identify the social and cultural
implications for particular cases.

This value reflects only the marginal or added
costs of protecting against the effects of a one meter
rise in water level by the year 2100. It does not
include any costs associated with basic coastal pro-
tection already in place or necessary to meet present
coastal defense needs. The estimate does not include
the value of the unprotected dry land or ecosystems
that would be lost, nor does it consider the costs of
responding to saltwater intrusion nor the impacts of
increased storm frequency.2?

Although the potential economic developments in
the next few decades are difficult to predict, an
approximation of basic implementation costs is pos-
sible. Although any such calculations are only
rough approximations, they provide a useful first
estimate and a guide for future data-collection ef-
forts. Table 5.5 illustrates estimates based on a sea
level rise scenario of one meter in 100 years, for 181

economics heavily dependent on tourism (e.g.,
Caribbean Islands) this may have scrious adverse

any response strategy. Options may be restricted

The greatest implications of retreat may lie in
being denied access to the original coast. A well-
planned retreat that provides for access to alterna-
tive resources could minimize some of these im-
pacts.3! An associated issue is that of the social
implications for the host people at the place of re-
location. There exists a potential for conflict, and
existing social services may be heavily taxed in the
host area if relocation is not well-planned and man-
aged. People may choose not to abandon even vul-
nerable coastal areas in anticipation of climate
change impacts, if there is strong population pres-
sure in adjacent areas.

fish stocks. If protective options involve non-local
labor, there may be social and cultural friction
which could lead to community disruption. Op-

prior to a meeting of the Agriculture, Forestry, and
Other Human Activities Subgroup (AFOS) to as-
sure broad participation from that Subgroup be-
cause of the potential overlaps on food and forests.
As this report was produced in parallel with the
IPCC Science and Impacts Working Groups’ first
report, rather than the more logical series approach,
special efforts were made to obtain these groups’
interim findings. Accordingly, the workshop also
heard reports from Working Groups I and II on
their efforts, particularly by participants in those
Groups concerned with agriculture and food secu-
rity. This First Report is a synthesis of all of the
above efforts.

"The First Report of the Resource Use and Man-
agement Subgroup (RUMS) focuses on that subset
of natural resources which are of common interest
to most nations, i.e., food, water, land, and biolog-
ical resources. The topics, which were selected at
the RUMS initial meetings, were: agriculture, ani-
mal husbandry, fisheries, desertification and sali-
nization, forestry, land use, unmanaged ecosystems
(including biological diversity), and water re-
sources, Various nations produced papers address-
ing one or more of these topics. Based upon these
contributions, theme papers addressing water re-
sources, biological diversity and food security were
commissioned from individuals associated with the
American Association for the Advancement of Sci-
ence’s Water Resources and Climate Change Panel,
United Nations Environment Programme, and the
Food and Agricultural Organization, respectively.
In addition, the several papers on each of the above-
mentioned topics were consolidated.

In many instances, the impacts of human-

perturbation on the larger effects resulting from
increasing populations and other socio-economic

The impacts of, and responses to, human-
induced climate changes on resource use and man-
agement must be considered against a backdrop of
(a) population growth, which increases the pres-
sures and demands on all resources, (b) technologi-
cal change, which may alleviate some pressures
while creating others, (c) the hoped-for advance-
ments in economic progress that could, on the one
hand, increase the per capita demand for some re-
sources but, on the other hand, allow for greater
support for resource conservation and environmen-

tal protection, and (d) natural climatic variability.

"+ Society and living things have a built-in ability
to adapt to some degree of climate change be-
cause climate is inherently variable at all time
scales. Through the ages they have developed
the capability, and a suite of responses, to
adapt—in many instances, successfully—to ex-
treme events (e.g., floods, droughts).

« As noted in the Scientific Assessment, human
activities will alter the climate; however, eco-
nomic and technological progress will also
make it easier to cope with climatic variability
and extreme events through earlier warning
systems, better infrastructure, and greater fi-
nancial resources.

* Several climatic zones span the globe, and re-
source use and management is an ongoing chal-
lenge in each of these zones. Therefore, one
area could draw upon experiences and practices
in those zones that most closely approximate

Temperature increase attributable to atmospheric
composition change is expected to be larger at
higher latitudes, particularly in the Northern
Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, there
may be impacts on agriculture in areas already suf-
fering from environmental problems, e.g., soil deg-
radation. For small island states, sea level rise will
expose vulnerabilities. While some semiarid areas
may be vulnerable, some in the north may, in fact,
benefit, e.g., due to increases in agricultural pro-
ductivity. Morcover, some sectors are more able to

In agriculture, and to some extent in forestry, the

rate at which technology is introduced is, on the
whole, likely to accelerate with the advent of bio-
technology and genetic engineering. The efficiency
with which many countries have adopted new tech-
nology in these sectors, albeit often without ade-
quate environmental assessment, suggests a con-
siderable ability to adapt to new circumstances
whatever their cause; however, the closer farming is
to subsistence farming the less the likelihood that it
would adapt without assistance and “appropriate
design.”

"This is especially true for activities that are man-
aged intensely (e.g., agriculture, water usc, and
plantation forests). However, even if there are sim-
ilarities in the climates, other conditions may be
sufficiently different to preclude use of analogues
without modifications. In addition, there may be
legal, economic, institutional or cultural bar-
riers to translocating adaptation measures from one
locale to another. More importantly, the ability
to adapt is not uniform: developing nations would
have greater difficulty in adapting, especially if that
requircs substantial financial expenditures and in-
stitutional changes, for example those which could
occur as a result of loss of cultural and social heri-

"Nevertheless, these uncertaintics do not preclude
planning and taking anticipatory actions, where ap-

climate change could be very high or irreversible;
where the lifetime of decisions is long enough to be
adversely affected by a change in the climate; or
where there are significant technological, informa-
tional, cultural, legal, or other barriers to efficient
adaptation. Most importantly, many actions that
would help societies adapt to any climate change
would be worthwhile for other reasons—i.e., they
necd to be undertaken for wise and sustainable re-

Assessments of the potential impacts of climate
change might help clarify this point. In areas
that are likely to be further stressed, various
initiatives could be explored for conserving the
most sensitive and valuable resources including
strengthening conservation measures, manag-
ing development of highly vulnerable re-

afforestation. Identification of the most sensi-

be based upon each society’s consideration of
relevant social, cultural, environmental, and
economic factors.

Acceleration of economic development efforts

efforts improving agriculture and natural re-

In summary, development and analysis of limita-
tion and adaptation strategics must be harmonized.
There is a relationship between the timing and costs
of limitation and adaptation: the slower the rate of
climate change, the easier it would be to adapt, and
vice versa. Limitation measures should be consis-
tent with adaptation goals, where possible. Thus,
analysis of monoculture plantations to absorb CO,
should consider their potential negative impact on
biological diversity. Moreover, analysis of the rela-
tive merits of various limitations strategies should
consider other non-warming consequences of con-
trolling the various gases (either individually or to-
gether) including, e.g., direct effects of CO, and
CFCs on the biosphere. Thus a truly comprehen-
sive approach toward human-induced climate
change should recognize that controlling the differ-
ent gases might have different effects on the adaptive
capacity of natural resources.

The impacts of human-induced climate changes
on resource use and management must be consid-
ered against a backdrop of population growth that
will increase the pressures and demands on all re-
sources, and technological change which may alle-
viate some pressures while creating others.
Moreover, the hoped-for improvement in each in-
dividual’s economic status will have a complicated
effect on resources. On the one hand, economic
growth could increase the per capita demand for
some resources and may increase greenhouse gas
emissions; on the other, it also allows for greater
support for resource conservation and environmen-
tal protection.

In attempting to maximize social well-being, it
should be noted that there are several societal goals
that are partly in competition with each other.
These include the need for agricultural and eco-
nomic development and growth to enhance both
economic and food security even as populations
increase, and the need to assure that such economic
development and growth is done in a sustainable
manner so that the resource base is not degraded
and is consistent with the need for a clean and
healthy environment. The importance that one so-
ciety (or segment of society) places on each of these
goals is determined by a variety of factors including
current socio-economic status, cultural traditions,
institutional systems, expectations for the future,
and historical factors. Because of these competing
considerations, as noted in Section 6.1.2, it is to be
expected that some adaptation options could maxi-
mize social well-being for one set of social, environ-
mental, and economic circumstances but not for
another, and that different societies (or segments of
societies) would choose to pursue various options
to different degrees.

aged system with substantial flexibility, such
adjustments (either in absolute terms or in their

Whether or not fisheries become more or less
productive, the spatial and temporal distribu-

changed. Some fishing communities (and/or
nations) may gain at the expense of others.
Impacts on unmanaged or natural ecosystems
could be critical. If the rate of climate change is
more rapid than their rate of adaptation, species
composition and biodiversity may be affected.
However, established growth may persist for
decades or longer, and, in some cases, degener-

over the span of several decades or centuries,
shift species poleward or to higher altitudes or
lead to cases of extinction. Moreover, if the rate
of climate change is sufficiently rapid, ensem-
bles of species may end up trapped in climatic
regimes for which they are not generally suit-
able and some species may not adapt quickly
enough to prevent their extinction. The effects
on migratory species may be mixed: the longer
the migratory route, the greater the likclihood

While it is possible that human activities and tech-
nology could change the climate, society’s ability to
cope with such climatic events is now higher than
ever because of technology (including better com-
munications, transportation, and food storage), and
increased wealth. The lessons learned from these
events can all be applied in formulating and imple-
menting responses to human-induced climate
change. Moreover, people in one area can learn
from those in other areas. We now grow several
crops over a wider range of climate (and tempera-
ture) than is “predicted” under scenarios that would
double greenhouse gas concentrations. Thus, if
southern Canada were to become as warm and dry
as, say, Texas then it may be able to learn from the
agricultural practices in the latter area to better
adapt to and cope with the impact of climate change
on food security even though not all other condi-

Increasing populations, and associated demand

for land for agriculture, human settlements, grazing
and plantation forests, and for forest products (e.g.,
fuelwood, timber), have reduced the area of some
natural ecosystems. Moreover, human activities
have made certain natural ecosystems more vulner-
able in many parts of the world even though they
have a degrce of inherent variability. Thus, adaptive
policies may be necessary to enhance the resilience
of such ecosystems: the faster the rate of climate
change, the greater the need of developing, evaluat-
ing and implementing such policies.

"+ Flexibility. Since the effects of climate change
are uncertain, responses need to be successful
under a variety of conditions, including no-
climate-change. Thus, flexibility is a matter of
keeping options open. For instance, a market
mechanism for pricing and allocating resources
will work under a variety of conditions and,
therefore, is flexible.

that make sense anyway.” Such policies would
be justifiable in their own right, 1.e., in the
absence of climate change. They would neces-

preparing for climate change; thus, they would
be beneficial even if climate were not to change.

"Several steps should be taken prior to any evalua-
tion of response strategies. As a start, one should
differentiate between the possible and likely im-
pacts of climate change. Inherently, anything that
does not violate a law of nature (e.g., the Third Law
of Thermodynamics) is possible. Thus, dealing with
merely what is possible is not a wise use of re-
sources. Ideally, one would need to know the prob-
ability distributions for climate change effects (as a
function of space and time). However, the uncer-
taintics associated with climate change and its ef-
fects generally preclude such differentiation
between potential and likely effects. These uncer-
tainties also restrict the analysis of response strate-
gies in terms of their effectiveness and intercom-
parisons of the social, economic, and environmental
consequences of implementing response strategies
versus doing nothing. Nevertheless, adaptive re-
sponse strategies can be evaluated on the basis of
several criteria.

for considering and/or adopting response strategies

While attempting this, one has to be cognizant that
resources (whether they be natural or human and
financial) are limited. Opportunity costs must be
considered: expenditures ona response strategy will
divert resources from other potentially worthwhile
social uses. These include public health, environ-
mental and safety needs, and economic growth.
Wealth generated by such growth will eventually
make response measures more affordable. Poverty
is one of the major causes of environmental degra-
dation. It is also one reason why poorer nations
employ obsolete technologies that often are more

"Such policies include those that would enhance
net public well-being by, e.g., environmental
quality, or food or economic security. Thus,
even if climate does not change, society would
reap net benefits from this approach. Factors to
consider in assessing whether a policy “makes
sense anyway” include economic efficiency
(including environmental factors), — cost-
effectiveness, and opportunity costs.

Timing. Since climate change may not be felt for
decades, the benefits of adaptive policies may
also not be realized for decades. Thus, expen-
sive anticipatory actions will not be justified
unless the expected costs of climate change are
very high. For instance, a dam should not be
constructed today in anticipation of being
needed several decades hence. On the other
hand, if a dam is being built now, it may be
useful to “design in” the ability for future
augmentations—if that changes the costs only
marginally. Factors to consider in assessing
timeliness include: (a) whether there is a critical
point in time before the adaptation strategy
needs to be implemented, and (b) how much
time does it take to efficiently develop the re-
sponse (and necessary technology), and educate
and disseminate it to users/implementers?
Feasibility. Adaptive strategies must be consis-
tent with legal, institutional, political, social,
cultural, and financial arrangements. ‘hese are
critical aspects of their “do-ability.” However,
in some instances, policies may specifically be
directed at modifying or removing such bar-
ricrs.

Compatibility. Response stratcgics for one sec-
tor (or activity) should not run counter to adap-
tive strategies in other sectors or activities.
Similarly, adaptive strategies should not defeat
or negate limitation strategies (or their objec-
tives), and vice versa. Sce Section 6.1.5.

water supply with demand. The problems that do
occur with respect to water are usually on a regional

not in another. To achieve the goal of matching

have used demand-side management such as ration-

occur over many decades, it is uncertain whether
these changes—should they come—would be grad-

signed to operate under extreme conditions (greatly
increased or decreased run-off), but water resources
managers will have to consider that the frequency
and magnitude of extreme events may be altered.
Given the uncertainties regarding the extent, mag-

on water resources, it may be prudent to delay
consideration of more costly adaptation measures
(Category C) until after these uncertainties are re-

may require a longer lead time to respond to climate

prices provide signals and incentives to conserve

prices will generally conserve water and modify
technologies and crop selection. Therefore, pricing
by water supply authorities to reflect real or re-
placement costs promotes efficient use. However,
the cost of water supply facilities constructed by
government entities is often recovered partially
through property taxes or means other than
through commodity charges levied on final con-
sumers. In other cases, the facilities are subsidized,
with the cost being fnanced through general gov-
ernment revenues or income taxes. The result is that
water is often priced inefficiently, below its cost of
delivery or its long-run marginal cost. This leads to
overuse of water and the other resources needed to
construct water supply facilities. There is substan-
tial additional opportunity for cities and irrigation
districts to utilize pricing as a means of conserving
water by employing marginal-cost pricing (charging
for the cost of the last-added and most expensive
increment of supply) or progressive-rate pricing

is organized at many levels, ranging from complete

Climate change could alter the physical suit-

uses in many areas. The climate has played a signifi-
cant role in present land-use patterns and on the
occurrence and distribution of present-day agri-
cultural and forest lands, human settlements, and

could be altered if significant changes in the climate
occur. In this process, forests and other ecosystems

land-use patterns could change: some areas that to-

currently stressed areas, climate change could
relieve existing pressures. Assessments of the
potential impacts of climate change would help
identify which areas could be subject to in-
creased stress. Future development in areas that
may come under increasing stress could con-
sider management tools such as regulation of
development, purchase from or payments to
the owner, tax incentives, and impact charges.
For example, highly erodible or other marginal
lands may be protected by offering farmers an-
nual payments in lieu of cultivating such land—
with participation in such programs being
strictly voluntary. More active management
and intervention such as the creation of pro-
tected areas, where appropriate, may be neces-
sary to maintain viable populations of certain
endangered or threatened species. As for all
responses, social, economic, and environmen-
tal consequences must be considered in evaluat-
ing and selecting options.

Promoting resource conservation (B). Conser-
vation practices could increase the resilience of
resources to climatic stresses by moderating lo-
cal climates, promoting water retention, de-
creasing soil erosion, increasing genetic
variability, and reducing other stresses from en-
vironmental degradation. This may allow for
the maintenance of long-term productivity.

Particular attention might be given to reduc-
ing deforestation, improving watcr-use effi-
ciency, increasing the use of sustainable
agricultural and forestry practices, and ensuring
that the intensity of resource use is consistent
with carrying capacity. Also, analysis of land-
use options should consider factors such as si-
multaneously accomplishing several objectives
(e.g., floodplain hazard reduction, wetland and
fisheries protection, and migration corridor
needs, as appropriate).

Improve storage and food distribution of agri-
cultural products (B). Improved methods of
storing and distributing food and agricultural
products, supplemented by methods of mini-
mizing storage losses, would lessen the severity
of future food deficits, whether or not caused

This, too, would be more beneficial to eco-

the other hand, in areas where there is sufficient
land in its natural state or which is not fenced

with purchasing lands for natural areas or corti-

with concentric buffer zones of protection

For some countries and communities the most
serious issue is not the long-run adequacy of sup-
plies but year-to-year instability of supplies. Such
instability arises primarily from dependence on
rain-fed agriculture in drought-prone areas; from
population pressures that have forced people to cul-
tivate more marginal land and/or to maintain more
livestock than the rangeland or pastures can feed,
with consequent wide fluctuations in crop yields
and high livestock mortality during times of
drought; from the unwillingness or inability to
maintain sufficient stocks; from cyclical supply/
demand patterns in the world food market; and
from frequent changes in government policies, sup-
port prices, etc.

Access to supplies has two major dimensions: a
national dimension reflecting the ability of coun-
tries to enter the world market to buy additional
food, which in part is a function of the openness of
the trade system and the ability of food deficit coun-
tries to carn foreign exchange through exports; and
a personal income dimension, in that extensive pov-
erty restricts the ability of individuals and house-
holds to buy all the food they need for a healthy
diet. ‘Thus, local or imported supplies must be
matched by effective demand and appropriate
mechanisms to ensure access to supplies by those
lacking purchasing power. Without such mecha-
nisms the market will maintain supplies at levels that
leave many people hungry.

Across communities and target audiences, educa-
tion and information should be geared toward mak-
ing people more capable of dealing with the
problems associated with climate change and better
able to make responsible decisions as full global
partners. Education is used broadly to encompass
formal and informal processes of teaching and
learning that occur throughout the life of the indi-
vidual in the home, the school, the workplace and a
range of other settings where instruction, training,
and firsthand experience are conveyed. Similarly,
information refers to materials and data that are
produced and accessible in a varicty of formats
varying in formality and technical sophistication.
Thus, for purposes of IPCC response strategies,
both education and information are interactive and
dynamic ways of fostering new levels of environ-
mental sensitivity and awareness in public and pri-
vate lives.

summarized in this section. While it was recognized
that broad-based understanding is essential, it was
also appreciated that no single mechanism or tem-

approaches and information tailored to the specific
requirements and resources of particular locales,

collaboration is critical to taking efficient and effec-

Appropriate criteria for selecting technol-

and benefits. Account must also be taken
of suitability to local needs and condi-

(including defense, economy, energy, and
food), and acceptability to the public.

Technological development will have to be

natural resources.

Adequate and trained human resources in

There is a need for international informa-

continuously monitor development of
technologies to limit or adapt to climate
change. In this connection, it is necessary
to ask where and how existing information
systems are inadequate.

Governments should work cooperatively
to conduct periodic assessments of the
state of these technologies.

There is a need to devclop methodologies
to assess the social, environmental, and
cconomic consequences of actions or inac-
tions on climate change.

There is an urgent need for economic an-
alyses and supporting scientific informa-
tion to determine external costs and
benefits referred to B.1.(a) above.

Most contributors saw market-based instruments
(as well as planning mechanisms in centrally
planned economies) as having a role in achieving
objectives for limiting or reducing emissions of
greenhouse gases, rather than in determining what
the optimal level of emissions ought to be. Al-
though it was recognized that the purpose of policy
measures is to enhance overall welfare, this requires
a balancing of the costs of climate change with the
costs of policy measures implemented to reach
emission reduction targets. Whether or not a strict
cost/benefit approach is applied, it seems clear that
all costs must be taken into account in setting policy
objectives and determining the mix of options for
implementation.

At either the national or international level, a
further variation of this system is to allow emission
entitlements to be granted for the creation of sinks.
An international policy regime that focuses on
global climate objectives, rather than the means by
which they are achieved, would treat sink creation
and emissions reduction as one-for-one substitutes.

At the international level, a tradeable emission
permit system could be based on the same concepts
as those described above. As a first step, an overall
emission budget could be set. Global emission bud-
gets and initial emission entitlements for each coun-
try could be determined in a number of possible
ways: the entitlements could be allocated by the
level of emissions in a base year, by population size
of acountry, by a target unit of emissions per unit of
GNP, by a target unit of fossil fuel use per unit of
population or GNP, etc.

There has been to date only limited experience
with tradeable emission permits at the national
level, and no experience at the international level.
One example that has been implemented in the
United States is its programme to phase down the
use of lead in gasoline. Under this programme, the
United States government set a target for the usage
of lead in gasoline through a regulatory process and
used a trading system that allowed gasoline refiners
to allocate the lead budget in an economically effi-
cient manner. Although this can be viewed as recog-
nizing a “right to pollute,” it is only a right to
pollute up to a level determined to be environmen-

"An emission permit system is based on the concept
that emission entitlements (like coupons) or rights
to pollute are provided to emitting sources (which
can be as large as countries), subject to an overall
limit on total emissions. The sum of entitlements is
equal to an emissions budget set at the national level
through regulation or at the international level
through international agreements. A “‘tradeable”
emission permit system extends the emission permit
system by allowing the permit holders to trade or
sell their entitlements to another party on the open
market. It is supplementary to a regulatory pro-
gramme in that it operates within overall limits on
emissions of the greenhouse gas.

Once the initial entitlements to each country have
been determined, countries would of course have to
allocate their overall budget to the sources in their
country, This allocation procedure could follow
whatever lines are deemed most appropriate, given
their social and economic needs. However, at the
international level, a tradeable permit system might
operate like international share, currency, or com-
modity markets. Governments or individual enti-
tement holders could be free to buy or sell, brokers
could operate, and the spot price of an entitlement
would float to a current market valuation of a mar-
ginal unit of emissions. Making the market freely
accessible and issuing entitlements in small divisible
units should go a considerable distance in prevent~

ing any nation or firm from cornering the market.

A tax on fossil fuels, levied in relation to its car-

could in some circumstances reduce emissions of
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. For the tax to
be effective and efficient, its level should not be

First, it is difficult to assess the optimal rate at
which the tax should be applied in order to mect

of emissions is not set directly but attained through

The coordinators’ report has as its primary
objective the compilation of elements that
might be included in a future framework Con-
vention on Climate Change, and a discussion
of the issues that are likely to arise in the
context of developing those elements.

There is a general view that while existing legal
instruments and institutions with a bearing on
climate should be fully utilized and further
strengthened, they are insufficient alone to
meet the challenge. A very broad international
consensus has therefore emerged in the IPCC,
confirmed notably at the 44th United Nations
General Assembly, on the need for a frame-
work Convention on Climate Change. Such a
Convention should generally follow the for-
mat of the Vienna Convention for the Protec-
tion of the Ozone Layer, in laying down, as a
minimum, general principles and obligations.
It should further be framed in such a way as to
gain the adherence of the largest possible num-
ber and most suitably balanced spread of
countries while permitting timely action to be
taken; it should contain provision for separate
annexes/protocols to deal with specific obliga-
tions. As part of the commitment of the par-
ties to action on greenhouse gas emissions and
the adverse effects of global warming, the
Convention would also address the particular
financial needs of the developing countries,
the question of the access to and transfer of
technology, and institutional requirements.
