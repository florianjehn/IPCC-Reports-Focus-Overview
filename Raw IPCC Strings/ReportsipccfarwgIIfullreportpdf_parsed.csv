"This is the final Report of Working Group II of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change, which is sponsored jointly by the World Meteorological Organization and the
United Nations Environment Programme. The report considers the potential impacts of
climate change. Several hundred working scientists from many countries have participated
in the preparation and review of the scientific data. The result is a unique statement on
impacts of climate change with a breadth not previously achieved by the international
scientific community. The impact assessments cover: agriculture and forestry, natural
terrestrial ecosystems, hydrology and water resources, human settlement and_ socio-
economic activities, oceans and coastal zones and the cryosphere. The information
presented here is the best available at present. It will inform the necessary scientific,
political and economic debates and negotiations that can be expected in the immediate
future. Appropriate strategies in response to the issue of climate change can be based on
the scientific foundation that the Report provides. The Report is, therefore, an essential
reference for all who are concerned with climate change and its consequences.

"In making its Impacts Assessment, Working Group II has built on the available country
assessments, taking into account significant work undertaken more recently. By its very
nature, such work is distributed over many fields. There are many uncertainties in them,
and some results have yet to be published. While some countries have produced
assessments of the impact of climate change on their economic, industrial and social
structure, there has not been a comprehensive assessment on a global scale.

"It gives me pleasure to acknowledge the contributions of so many, in particular the lead
authors, who have given freely of their expertise and time in the preparation of this

acknowledgement is due to Dr Greg Tegart, my Co-Vice Chairman from Australia, who
together with Mr Colin Griffiths and Mr Gordon Sheldon were responsible for the
compilation and editing of the overall report in Australia. Thanks are also due to Dr M

"The accompanying Policymakers' Summary, based closely on the conclusions of the
Assessment, has been prepared particularly to meet the needs of those without a strong
background in science who need a clear statement of the present status of scientific
knowledge and the associated uncertainties. It is clear from the report that comprehensive
estimates of the physical and biological effects of climate change at the regional level are
difficult. Confidence in regional estimates of critical climate factors is low, particularly
of precipitation and soil moisture. Much more research is needed to refine the estimates
of potential impacts and I urge Governments to continue and increase their support of
research on climate change.
"	Text
"In the preparation of the Assessment, many of the active scientists working in the
industrialised countries have been involved. Because of lack of sufficient funding, the
contribution from the developing countries has been less than hoped for, and it is clear
that much further work needs to be carried out to develop a better framework for
economic decisions in a number of countries, notably in Africa and South America. Over
200 contributors are identified in the report, but they have been supported by many
others. Because of the diversity of the topics, it has been difficult to carry out a full peer
review of the whole report. Chapters have been reviewed by selected organisations, both
national and international, and five meetings of lead authors and major contributors, over
a period of one and a half years, have helped to shape the final report. An extensive
technical review was carried out by the US National Climate Program in early 1990 and
helped to ensure a high degree of consensus among authors and reviewers regarding the
results presented. Joint Soviet American research in the area of climate change provided
a significant input. Thus the Assessment is an authoritative statement of the views of the
majority of the international scientific community at this time.

and response strategies (Working Group III) were
established in November 1988 and proceeded to
work in parallel under instructions from IPCC.

scribe the environmental and socioeconomic impli-
cations of possible climate changes over the next
decades caused by increasing concentrations of
greenhouse gases.

"These scenarios pre-date, but are in line with, the
recent assessment of Working Group I which, for
a 'business-as-usual' scenario (scenario A in Work-
ing Group I Report) has estimated the magnitude
of sea-level rise at about 20 cm by 2030 and about
65 cm by the end of the next century. Working
Group I has also predicted the increase in global
mean temperatures to be about 1°C above the
present value by 2025 and 3°C before the end of
the next century.

"Comprehensive estimates of the physical and bio-
logical effects of climate change at the regional
level are difficult. Confidence in regional esti-
mates of critical climatic factors is low. This is
particularly true of precipitation and soil moisture,
where there is considerable disagreement between
various general circulation model and palaeo-
analog results. Moreover, there are several scien-
tific uncertainties regarding the relationship be-
tween climate change and biological effects and
between these effects and socioeconomic conse-
quences.
"	Text
"population explosion will produce severe impacts
on land use and on the demands for energy, fresh
water, food and housing, which will vary from
region to region according to national incomes and
rates of development. In many cases, the impacts
will be felt most severely in regions already under
stress, mainly the developing countries.
Human-induced climate change due to continued
uncontrolled emissions will accentuate these im-
pacts. For instance, climate change, pollution and
ultraviolet-B radiation from ozone depletion can
interact, reinforcing their damaging effects on
materials and organisms. Increases in atmospheric
concentrations of greenhouse gases may lead to
irreversible change in the climate which could be
detectable by the end of this century.

"consequences. The shorter the lags, the less the
ability to cope and the greater the socioeconomic
impacts.
"	Text
"There is uncertainty related to these time lags.
The changes will not be steady and surprises can-
not be ruled out. The severity of the impacts will

depend to a large degree on the rate of climate
change.
"	Text
"The rate of projected climate changes is the major
factor determining the type and degree of climatic
impacts on natural terrestrial ecosystems. These
rates are likely to be faster than the ability of
some species to respond and responses may be
sudden or gradual.
"	Text
"Natural terrestrial ecosystems could face signifi-
cant consequences as a result of the global in-
creases in the atmospheric concentrations of
greenhouse gases and the associated climatic chan-
ges. Projected changes in temperature and pre-
cipitation suggest that climatic zones could shift
several hundred kilometres towards the poles over
the next fifty years. Flora and fauna would lag
behind these climatic shifts, surviving in their pres-
ent location and, therefore, could find themselves
in a different climatic regime. These regimes may
be more or less hospitable and, therefore, could
increase productivity for some species and de-
crease that of others. Ecosystems are not expect-
ed to move as a single unit, but would have a new
structure as a consequence of alterations in
distribution and abundance of species.
"	Text
"Patterns of agricultural trade could be altered by
decreased cereal production in some of the cur-
rently high-production areas, such as Western
Europe, southern US, parts of South America and
western Australia. Horticultural production in
mid-latitude regions may be reduced. On the
other hand, cereal production could increase in
northern Europe. Policy responses directed to
breeding new plant cultivars, and agricultural man-
agement designed to cope with changed climate
conditions, could lessen the severity of regional
impacts. On balance, the evidence suggests that in
the face of estimated changes of climate, food
production at the global level can be maintained at
essentially the same level as would have occurred
without climate change; however, the cost of
achieving this is unclear. Nonetheless, climate
change may intensify difficulties in coping with
rapid population growth. An increase or change

"Sufficient evidence is now available from a variety
of different studies to indicate that changes of
climate would have an important effect on agricul-
ture and livestock. Studies have not yet conclu-
sively determined whether, on average, global
agricultural potential will increase or decrease.
Negative impacts could be felt at the regional level
as a result of changes in weather and pests associ-
ated with climate change, and changes in ground-
level ozone associated with pollutants, necessitat-
ing innovations in technology and agricultural
management practices. There may be severe ef-
fects in some regions, particularly decline in
production in regions of high present-day vulnera-
bility that are least able to adjust. These include
Brazil, Peru, the Sahel Region of Africa, Southeast
Asia, the Asian region of the USSR and China.
There is a possibility that potential productivity of
high and mid latitudes may increase because of a
prolonged growing season, but it is not likely to
open up large new areas for production and it will
be mainly confined to the Northern Hemisphere.
"	Text
"The rotation period of forests is long and current
forests will mature and decline during a climate in
which they are increasingly more poorly adapted.
Actual impacts depend on the physiological ad-
aptability of trees and the host-parasite relation-
ship. Large losses from both factors in the form
of forest declines can occur. Losses from wild-fire
will be increasingly extensive. The climate zones
which control species distribution will move pole-
ward and to higher elevations. Managed forests
require large inputs in terms of choice of seedlot
and spacing, thinning and protection. They pro-
vide a variety of products from fuel to food. The
degree of dependency on products varies among
countries, as does the ability to cope with and to
withstand loss. The most sensitive areas will be
where species are close to their biological limits in
terms of temperature and moisture. This is likely
to be, for example, in semi-arid areas. Social
stresses can be expected to increase and conse-
quent anthropogenic damage to forests may occur.
These increased and non-sustainable uses will
place more pressure on forest investments, forest
conservation and sound forest management.

will be significant, especially for those regions of

availability of water resources and biomass, both
major sources of energy in many developing count-

within regions with some areas losing and others
gaining water and biomass. Such changes in areas
which lose water may jeopardise energy supply and
materials essential for human habitation and ener-
gy. Moreover, climate change itself is also likely

"In addition to changes in water supply, water de-
mand may also change through human efforts to
conserve, and through improved growth efficiency
of plants in a higher CO, environment. Net socio-
economic consequences must consider both supply
and demand for water. Future design in water
resource engineering will need to take possible
impacts into account when considering structures
with a life span to the end of the next century.
Where precipitation increases, water management
practices, such as urban storm drainage systems,
may require upgrading in capacity. Change in
drought risk represents potentially the most seri-
ous impact of climate change on agriculture at
both regional and global levels.
"	Text
"The most vulnerable human settlements are those
especially exposed to natural hazards, eg coastal or
river flooding, severe drought, landslides, severe
wind storms and tropical cyclones. The most
vulnerable populations are in developing countries,
in the lower income groups, residents of coastal
lowlands and islands, populations in semi-arid
grasslands, and the urban poor in squatter settle-
ments, slums and shanty towns, especially in mega-
cities. In coastal lowlands such as in Bangladesh,
China and Egypt, as well as in small island
nations, inundation due to sea-level rise and storm
surges could lead to significant movements of
people. Major health impacts are possible, espe-
cially in large urban areas, owing to changes in
availability of water and food and increased health
problems due to heat stress spreading of infec-
tions. Changes in precipitation and temperature
could radically alter the patterns of vector-borne
and viral diseases by shifting them to higher lati-
tudes, thus putting large populations at risk. As
similar events have in the past, these changes
could initiate large migrations of people, leading
over a number of years to severe disruptions of
settlement patterns and social instability in some

areas.
"	Text
"Relatively small climate changes can cause large
water resource problems in many areas, especially
arid and semi-arid regions and those humid areas
where demand or pollution has led to water scarci-
ty. Little is known about regional details of green-
house gas-induced hydrometeorological change. It
appears that many areas will have increased pre-
cipitation, soil moisture and water storage, thus
altering patterns of agricultural, ecosystem and
other water use. Water availability will decrease
in other areas, a most important factor for already
marginal situations, such as the Sahelian zone in
Africa. This has significant implications for agri-
culture, for water storage and distribution, and for
generation of hydroelectric power. In some
limited areas, for example, under the assumed
scenario of a 1°C to 2°C temperature increase,
coupled with a 10% reduction in precipitation, a
40-70% reduction in annual runoff could occur.
Regions such as Southeast Asia, that are depend-
ent on unregulated river systems, are particularly
vulnerable to hydrometeorological change. On the
other hand, regions such as the western USSR and
western United States that have large regulated
water resource systems are less sensitive to the
range of hydrometeorological changes in the as-
sumed greenhouse scenario.

"The areal coverage of seasonal snow and its dur-
ation are projected to decrease in most regions,
particularly at mid-latitudes, with some regions at
high latitudes possibly experiencing increases in

on, will have both positive and negative impacts on

melt); on regional transportation (road, marine, air

"Permafrost, which currently underlies 20-25% of
the land mass of the Northern Hemisphere, could
experience significant degradation within the next
40-50 years. Projected increases in the thickness of
the freeze-thaw (active) layer above the permafrost
and a recession of permafrost to higher latitudes
and altitudes could lead to increases in terrain
instability, erosion and landslides in those areas
which currently contain permafrost. As a result,
overlying ecosystems could be significantly altered
and the integrity of man-made structures and
facilities reduced, thereby influencing existing
human settlements and development opportunities.

"Global warming will accelerate sea-level rise,
modify ocean circulation and change marine eco-
systems, with considerable socioeconomic conse-
quences. These effects will be added to present
trends of rising sea-level, and other effects that
have already stressed coastal resources, such as
pollution and overharvesting. A 30-50 cm sea-level
rise (projected by 2050) will threaten low islands
and coastal zones. A i m rise by 2100 would
render some island countries uninhabitable, dis-
place tens of millions of people, seriously threaten
low-lying urban areas, flood productive land, con-
taminate fresh water supplies and change coast-
lines. All of these impacts would be exacerbated if
droughts and storms become more _ severe.
Coastal protection would involve very significant
costs. Rapid sea-level rise would change coastal
ecology and threaten many important fisheries.
Reductions in sea ice will benefit shipping, but

there are considerable shifts in land levels associated
with tectonic plate movements which can also lead
to rises and falls.

less, the impacts based on 1-2 m rise serve as a

from General Circulation Models and from palaeo-

insight into possible future climate conditions. The
General Circulation Models, developed by Western
scientists, are based on three-dimensional math-
ematical representations of the physical processes in
the atmosphere and the interactions of the atmos-
phere with the earth's surface and the oceans.
There is considerable scientific debate about the
merits and demerits of each of these, as discussed in

"It should be noted that, in many situations, the
overall impact is determined morc by the changes in
the magnitude and frequency of extreme events than
by changes in the average. This is especially the
case for tropical storms and droughts. The assess-

ges suggests a low probability of increased frequency
of extreme events. However, it is entirely possible
that shifts in climate regimes will result in changes
in frequency in certain regions.

is the impact of possible response strategies (devel-
oped by Working Group III) on the scenarios used
here. Thus, a major change in energy production
from fossil fuel to nuclear or renewable energy
sources could drastically alter our assessments.
Further, changes in agricultural practice could
dramatically alter yiclds of particular crops in certain
regions. These impacts of response strategies
require much additional work.

assessments of potential impacts of climate change
by considcring the sensitivity of natural systems to
significant variations. These are summarised in the
following sections under: agriculture and forestry;
terrestrial ecosystems; hydrology and water re-
sources; human settlement, energy, transport, indus-

"The General Circulation Models are, in their current
state of development, comparatively crude in their
description of many of the processes involved.
However they can be used to simulate regional
changes resulting from a range of concentrations of
CO, in the atmosphere. Working Group I has
favoured the General Circulation Model approach in
producing its predictions of temperature rise and
precipitation changes. In its report, estimates for
2020 have been given for central North America,
southern Asia, Sahel, southern Europe and
Australia, These are reproduced in Table 1.2 and
are broadly similar to those used by Working Group
II.

"Despite the current uncertainties, both techniques
have been used by Working Group II in the develop-
ment of regional impacts to assist policy makers.
There are problems with prediction of regional
precipitation since there is disagreement between
various General Circulation Model outputs as a
result of simplifications to the representation of
complex physical processes. Current research is
seeking to improve the General Circulation Model
approach and to increase resolution to enable better
regional predictions. There are also problems with
the palaeoanalog approach which yields differing
scenarios for precipitation from the General Circu-
lation Model approach. This leads to different
assessments of impact on water resources and
agriculture. Soviet scientists are working to validate
their techniques and improve regional scenarios.

"The purpose of this chapter is fourfold: first, to
identify those systems, sectors and regions of agricul-
ture and forestry that are most sensitive to anticipat-
ed changes of climate;' second, to summarise the
present knowledge about the potential socioecono-
mic impact of changes of climate on world agricul-
ture and forestry; third, to consider the adjustments
in agriculture and forestry that are most likely to
occur (even ifno policy responses were implement-
ed);> finally, to establish research priorities for
future assessments of impact.
"	Text
"A common approach to this problem is, first, to
estimate impacts as they might occur in the future,
assuming technology and management as it is now;
for example, assuming the extent of irrigation and
fertiliser application to be as at present. Subsequent
assessments then allow for possible developments in
technology and management, identifying those
adjustments necessary either to obviate major
negative effects or to exploit positive ones. This
distinction between 'impact experiments' and 'adjust-
ment experiments’ has been made in a number of
previous impact assessments (see Parry and Carter,
1988).
"	Text
"In the present report, and unless otherwise stated,
data on estimated impacts relate to changes in
productive potential against a baseline of present-day
base technology and management. However, likely
(actual) effects on production must be measured
against a realistic future reference base. In order to
characterise this baseline certain assumptions must
be made about changes in food and timber demand
(on the basis of changes in population and per
capita income), in use of inputs (particularly amount
of fertiliser), in extent of the farmed and forested
area and in many other aspects of agriculture and
forestry which are likely to alter in the future even
if climate did not change. These assumptions are
consistent with UN and World Bank projections.

"The potentially most important changes of climate
for agriculture, upon which there is some agreement
by GCMs, include changes in climatic extremes,
warming in the high latitudes, poleward advance of
monsoon rainfall, and reduced soil water availability
(particularly in mid latitudes in midsummer, and at
low latitudes).
"	Text
"There is relatively strong agreement among GCM
predictions that warming will be greater at higher
latitudes. This will reduce temperature constraints
on high-latitude poleward agriculture, increase the
competition for land here, and result in the north-
ward retreat of the southern margin of the boreal
forest (these possible effects are discussed in detail
in Section 3.4.1). Warming at low latitudes, although
less pronounced, is also likely to have a significant
effect on agriculture.
"	Text
"Probably the most important consequences for
agriculture would stem from higher potential évapo-
transpiration, primarily due to the higher tempera-
tures of the air and the land surface. Even in the
tropics, where temperature increases are expected to
be smaller than elsewhere, the increased rate of loss
of moisture from plants and soil would be consider-
able. It may be somewhat reduced by greater
humidity and increased cloudiness during the rainy
seasons, but could be pronounced in the dry seasons.
"	Text
"It is not clear whether temporal variances in tem-
perature or precipitation will occur as a result of
climatic change. However, even if variances remain
the same as under the present climate, an increase
in monthly or annual average temperatures will
result in the increased frequency of occurrences of
days with temperatures above particular thresholds.
Changes in the frequency of distribution of precipi-
tation is not as certain, but the combination of
elevated temperatures and drought constitutes the
greatest risk to agriculture in many regions from
global climatic change.
"	Text
"In a warmer world the intertropical convergence
zones (ITCZs) would be likely to advance further
poleward as a result of an enhanced ocean-continent
pressure gradient (itself the result of more warming
of the land surface in the pre-monsoon season). If
this were to occur - and it should be emphasised
that this conclusion is based on GCM equilibrium
experiments, and that the transient response could
be different - then total rainfall could increase in
some regions of monsoonal Africa, monsoonal Asia
and Australia, though there is currently little agree-
ment between GCMs on which regions these might
be. Rainfall could also be more intense in its
occurrence, so flooding and erosion could increase.

"made in this report concerning any specific impact
on agriculture. It is possible, however, to identify
what types of impacts might occur under a number
of possible changes of climate and thus, by infer-
ence, what types of climate change could constitute
a significant risk or benefit for agriculture. Four
approaches can be adopted to achieve this end: (i)
the identification a prion of the types of climate
change most critical for agriculture; (ii) the identifi-
cation of regions most at risk from such changes of
climate; (Hi) the consideration of types of impact
likely to result from climatic change; and, (iv) the
evaluation of adjustments that are likely to occur in
agriculture in response to such impacts or to the
perception of their risk of occurrence. These four
approaches will be followed, in turn, in this report.

"At present we cannot be certain about the regional
pattern of soil water changes that may occur. There
are, however, regions in the world where the GC M
predictions are in some agreement regarding such
changes. The following is a summary of those
regions where current 2 x C0, experiments by three
GCMs (GISS, GFDL and NCAR) all project de-
creases in soil water (Kellogg and Zhao, 1988; Zhao
and Kellogg, 1988; Schlesinger and Mitchell, 1985).
It should be emphasised that coincidence of results
for these regions is not statistically significant and
that the evidence available at present is extremely
weak. Moreover, the significance of decreases in
soil water will vary considerably from region to
region according to whether they occur during the
growing or non-growing season.

of many developing countries to feed their popula-

"One means of identifying regions most at risk from
climate change is to combine the two preceding
analyses, noting those regions which (i) are regions

soil water under equilibrium 2 x CO, climates and
also which (ii) are regions identified as critically
vulnerable in terms of their resource ability to
support existing population. These regions at risk
are:

"An additional set of regions that deserves particular
attention includes the food-exporting countries,
which are the source of most of the world's traded
cereals. Here, substantially adverse or beneficial
changes of climate could markedly affect the amount
of traded food and its price. A key role in the world
food system is played by a few food-exporting
countries, with only 21 out of 172 countries in the
world currently being net exporters of cereals. In
1987, 77% of all traded cereals derived from only
three countries.

"Certain regions stand out as particularly vulnerable
as a result of climatic and soil constraints on then-
land base and their population requirements where,
even with high levels of inputs, land resources
cannot meet the needs of local populations. These
occupy as much as 22% of the global land area and
contain 11% of the population. Areas under great-
est pressure, where there is a high degree of imbal-
ance between population and land potential, are the
cool and cold tropics (eg the Andean region, the
Maghreb, the mountain regions of Southwest Asia),
the Indian subcontinent, and parts of mainland and
insular Southeast Asia.
"	Text
"The regions identified above are those where soil
water may decrease in an equilibrium climate for
doubled equivalent CO,. But different latitudes
could approach equilibrium at different rates of
change in temperature and rainfall because they
include different amounts of land, which warms up
faster than ocean. Thus the time-evolving patterns
of soil water change could vary significantly from the
equilibrium simulation. Moreover, the effects of
climatic changes on agriculture are likely to be
greater during periods of rapid change, before
equilibrium is reached and before farming systems
have had time to adapt to their altered environment.
Despite these important caveats, we may conclude
that there may be some regions where significant
reductions in agricultural potential occur due to
decreases in crop water availability. There is at
present, however, little agreement as to which
regions these will be.
"	Text
"In addition to the unequal regional pattern of critical
types of climatic change, there are important in-
equalities in the distribution of present-day vulnera-
bility to climate. Since climate is the major factor
limiting potential productivity at the global level,
changes of climate are likely to have substantial
effects on such limits. Insufficient temperature and
rainfall are the main climatic limits which operate
largely through the curtailment of the growing
period. Overall, 63% of the land area of developing
countries is climatically suited to rain-fed agriculture,
but this endowment varies considerably between
regions (FAO, 1984). It amounts to as much as
85% in South America, 84% in Southeast Asia, but
is limited to 64% in Central America and 53% in
Africa. The severest climatic limitations to rain-fed
agriculture are to be found in Southwest Asia where
17% is too mountainous and cool, and 65% is too
dry, leaving only 18% as potentially productive
(FAO, 1984).

with concentration increases in the upper end of the

respiration and thereby on growth (the accumulation
of dry matter), and there are additional effects of
increased C0, on development, yield quality and
stomatal aperture and water use (see Gifford, 1988;
Morison, 1989).

"In addition, it should be noted how sensitive world
food security remains to variations in weather. To
illustrate, in 1987-88 world wheat and coarse grain
stocks stood at 353 million tonnes (mt), but fell to
248 mt in 1988-89 and are estimated to be 249 mt in
July 1989 (International Wheat Council, 1989).
Most of this fall is attributable to reductions in stock
in North America due to the 1988 heatwave and
drought in the Great Plains and Corn Belt. Closing
stocks of wheat in the US fell from 49 mt in 19867
87, to 34 mt in 1987-88 and to 17 mt in 1988-89.
Thus factors affecting stocks in North America also
affect world food stocks and prices.

"In the overwhelming majority of cases the effect of
C0. on productivity has been shown to be beneficial
- if all other factors are maintained constant - and a
10-50% increase in dry matter accumulation can
occur in most species with a doubling of ambient
C0. concentration. In a summary of 770 studies the
mean mature yield increase for C3 crops (see below)
was 26% but the extremes ranged from a decrease
of 20% to an increase of 200% (Kimball, 1983). For
temperate cereals the mean increase observed in
grain yield was 36%. The large range in effect of
CO, can, to some extent, be attributed to species
differences, however few realistic studies under
comparable conditions have been made.

"In general, as photosynthesis is the net accumulation
of carbohydrates formed by the uptake of CO.,,
increased C0, results in increased photosynthesis.
A doubling of C0, increases the instantaneous
photosynthetic rate by 30% to 100%, depending on
the other environmental conditions (Pearcy and
Bjorkman, 1983). The balance between the photo-
synthetic gain and loss of carbohydrate from plants
by respiration is the resultant growth. Unfortunate-
ly, the response of respiration to C 0, has been little
studied and there are suggestions that respiration
could be lower rather than higher owing to a
changed carbohydrate status (Bunce, 1989). This
process may underlie some of the unexpectedly high
responses of growth to increased C 0, that have been
observed. Within single species there are differences
in responsiveness between different varieties and
genotypes, differences that offer the possibility of
breeding for optimum advantage with increased CO,.
In order to take full advantage of such opportunities

these varieties and genotypes must be identified
now.

but the final outcome will depend on the relative
response of crop and weed to climatic changes as
well. C3 weeds in C4 crops may increase as a

"Although C4 crops account for only about one-fifth
of the world's food production they are a particularly
important source of world food in the tropical

"A third biochemical group of plants that is locally
important in the arid zone are those with CAM
metabolism (Crassulacean Acid Metabolism), which
includes many plants in the cactus family, the Crass-
ulaceae and desert succulents. The species in this
group of major commercial importance are sisal and
pineapple. These plants will show little or no
response to increased CO., thus eroding their
competitive advantage over common C3 weeds and
reducing yields relative to C3 crops.

"4°-6°C (Acock and Allen, 1985; Osmond et al.,
1980; Jones, 1986). This may appear to be of
considerable advantage in warmer climates, but the
optimum range of temperature for photosynthesis
also narrows. In present conditions temperature has
relatively little effect over a broad range for most
plants growing in the habitats to which they are
currently adapted. Under elevated levels of CO,,
photosynthesis and, by inference, growth rate, may
therefore become more variable as temperature
conditions vary.

"Two groups of plants differ in their fundamental
carbon fixation biochemistry - the C3 and C4 groups.
It is widely accepted that the response of growth to
elevated C0, in C3 plants (eg wheat, rice, barley,
root crops, legumes) is larger than that of C4 plants
(eg maize, sorghum, millets, sugarcane). It has been
estimated that the average effect of doubled CO,
concentration on wheat grain yield is an increase of
35% (from eight studies, Cure, 1985) while that on
maize has not been adequately quantified (Cure,
1985). Most crops grown in cool, temperate or
moist habitats are C3 plants, as are all trees. The
C3 group therefore accounts for most of the world's
plant biomass.

shortage, salinity, cool temperatures and air pollu-
tion) the relative effect of increased CO. is larger
than under optimal conditions (Morison, 1988;
Warrick et al., 1986). Indeed, increased C0, could
improve growth sufficiently to make saline and
polluted environments more productive though, as
with all of these interactions, insufficient data exist
to produce quantitative predictions. Another envi-
ronmental interaction for which few, if any, studies
have been completed is the combined effect on
agriculture of acidic depositions and GHG-induced
changes.

have also been shown to be affected by elevated C0,
in both positive and negative directions, although
this has not yet been widely studied (Morison, 1989).
If the developmental process is affected then the
progress of the crop through the different stages of
the life cycle is altered, thus potentially shortening or
lengthening the required growing period. In
temperate zones this may mean decreases or in-
creases in yield, respectively, but in seasonally arid
areas any lengthening of the required growing
season is generally associated with increased drought
risk. Since many of the advances in cropping in such
areas have been due to the introduction of shorter
duration varieties, the developmental response of the
crops of these areas urgently needs to be examined.

accelerate the existing trend in the third world
countries to replace C4 crops with C3 as a response
to the promise of high-yielding varieties of wheat,
rice and barley. For example, in the last 20 years in
India there has been a reduction in the production
of C4 crops from 40% to only 23% of the total
cereal production. Conversely, it may counteract the
current poleward expansion in the temperate zone of
grain maize which would otherwise follow increases
in global temperature. Similarly, it may reverse the
current trend away from perennial rye-grass (C3)
towards silage maize as the major forage product in
temperate zones (Jones, 1986). Another probable
area of impact will be on sugar production, reducing

pests and disease organisms and humans. Over the
last 40 years there has been a 1-to-l relationship
between nitrogen applied to wheat crops in the UK

"Increased levels of C0, can enhance nitrogen
fixation by leguminous species, through increased
rates of photosynthesis. Many C4 species harbour
nitrogen-fixing bacteria such as Axospirullum and
Azatobactor in their rhizosphere which contribute to
nitrogen fixation and support growth at low nitrogen
contents of the soil. The direct effects of CO, on
nitrogen fixation could be advantageous in grass and
legume pastures. However, increased temperature
can reduce nitrogen fixation and also increase the
energy cost of nitrogen fixation. At what tempera-
ture the beneficial effects of C0, would be counter-
acted is difficult to predict, but the existing strains of
Rhizobium which are adaptable at low temperature
may require replacement for deriving the potential
benefits of enhance C0,. This would also apply to
many tree species which fix nitrogen through rhizo-

water conditions could impair these effects. More

"eaiCculations OF evaporauion Nave relled On the
Penman-Monteith model for evaporation which in-
cludes meteorological and vegetation variables in a
sound mechanistic framework. However, its use in
predictions is limited as the variables are not inde-
pendent of each other. At the level of single leaves
the evaporation rate affects the leaf temperature,
which affects the net radiation, to an extent depend-
ent on the degree of 'coupling' of leaf to the air
around it (Morison, 1985 and 1989). There is
additional feedback in whole canopies between the
humidity in the canopy and the evaporation rate
from the plant and the soil surface (Morison, 1989;
McNaughton and Jarvis, 1983; Goudriaan, 1989).
Further, at the regional scale, the temperature and
humidity conditions in the mixed planetary boundary
layer are also dependent on the heat and vapour
transfer from the vegetation surface. The extent of
these feedbacks varies with the microclimatic and
vegetation conditions so that predictions of changes
in evaporation rates with changed climate and
increased C0, vary considerably both in magnitude
and sign. In addition, increased growth results in
greater leaf area so the total water use per plant in
high C0, may be similar to that in present concen-
trations (Gifford, 1988), although for complete
vegetation stands the changes in leaf area index may
change the whole pattern of energy exchange at the
surface. The net effect is likely to be small for
short, dense, extensive crops and more important in
sparse and tall vegetation in semi-arid areas.

They suggest, however, that a 1°C increase in mean

has shown that filtering air of normal pollutant

"An important additional affect of warming, especially
in temperate and mid-latitudes, is likely to be the
reduction of winter chilling (vernalisation). Many
temperate crops require a period of low tempera-

flowering process. Low vernalisation results in low
flower bud initiation and, ultimately, reduced yields.
A 1°C warming would reduce effective winter

"Shifts of moisture limits to agriculture There is much
less certainty about GHG-induced changes in rainfall
than there is about temperature - not only concern-
ing the magnitude of change, but also its spatial
pattern and its distribution through the year. For
this reason it is difficult to identify possible rainfall-
induced shifts in the climatic limits to agriculture.
This is particularly so because relatively small
changes in the seasonal distribution of rainfall can
have disproportionately large effects on the viability
of agriculture in tropical areas, largely through
changes in growing period when moisture is suffi-
cient and thus through the timing of critical episodes
such as planting etc. However, regions where
changes in average rainfall may have the most
pronounced effect have been outlined in Section 2
(above).

"There is a distinct possibility that, as a result of high
rates of evapotranspiration, some regions in the
tropics and subtropics could be characterised by a
higher frequency of drought, or a similar frequency
of more intense drought than at present. Current
uncertainties about how regional patterns of rainfall
will alter, mean that no useful prediction of this can
at present be made. However, it is clear in some
regions that relatively small decreases in water
availability can readily produce drought conditions.
In India, for example, lower-than-average rainfall in
1987 reduced food grains production from 152 mt to
134 mt, lowering food buffer stocks from 23 to 9 mt.
Changes in the risk and intensity of drought, espe-
cially in currently drought-prone regions, represent
potentially the most serious impact of climatic
change on agriculture both at the global and the
regional level.

"Since crop yields often exhibit a non-linear response
to heat or cold stress, changes in the probability of
extreme temperature events can be significant
(Mearns et al., 1984; Parry, 1976). In addition, even
assuming no change in the standard deviation of
temperature maxima and minima, we should note
that the frequency of hot and cold days can be
markedly altered by changes in mean monthly
temperature. To illustrate, under the GISS 2x CO,
scenario the number of days in which temperatures
would fall below freezing would decrease from 39 to
20 in Atlanta, Georgia (US), while the number of
days above 90°F would increase from 17 to 53

which losses of agricultural output could result from
heat stress, particularly in tropical regions, is there-

no studies have yet been made of this. The appar-

in tropical regions (ca I’ to 2°C under a 2x CO,

wetter than at present, yields of adapted cultivars of
spring wheat are estimated to increase by about 10%
in the south, up to 20% in central Finland, and more
near the current northern limit of wheat. Yields of
barley and oats are raised by 9-18%, depending on
the region in Finland (Kettunen et al., 1988). In
Iceland the carrying capacity of improved grassland
for sheep is estimated to increase by about two-and-

decrease in Western Australia (Pittock, personal

wheat production, particularly in southwestern
Western Australia, northwestern Victoria and
western South Australia could decrease. Experi-
mental work suggests that spring wheat yields could
increase by about 20% and 27% under a 2°C and
3°C warming respectively, provided there was
sufficient water for full irrigation. Dryland wheat
yields would decrease unless there occurred a sub-
stantial increase in rainfall (Gifford, 1988). The
area under maize and sorghum may increase at the
expense of wheat, barley and oats, particularly in
northern New South Wales. There would be an
increase in yields of sugarcane and tropical fruits,
with a tendency for a southward shift of these from
Queensland into northern New South Wales
(Pittock, personal communication, 1989; Linforth,
personal communication, 1989). However, yields of
temperate fruits (apples, pears etc) would decline
and areas of production would be pushed into
southern Victoria and Tasmania (Pittock, personal
communication, 1989). Increased grass growth
would allow greater cattle production, but problems
of heat stress in sheep would increase. Cattle might
therefore increase their range at the expense of
sheep (Pittock, personal communication, 1989).
Potential benefits from increased grass growth will
unfortunately more than likely be offset by the poor
nutritive value of tropical as compared with
temperate species. This, together with (a) loss of
the Mediterranean-type climatic zones of Victoria
and Western Australia, which are the prime lamb

issue: the largest reductions under a range of

(-20%), maize (-13%) and rice (-11%) (EPA, 1989).
Overall, production is estimated to be sufficient for
domestic needs, but the potential for export is
reduced. In Canada, production is estimated to
decrease in Alberta and Saskatchewan, but perhaps
increase in Manitoba and Ontario (Smit, 1987;
Arthur, 1988). In northern Europe cereal produc-

stock production would be greater as a result of the
higher carrying capacities of pasture (Bergthorsson

in the Low Countries, UK and Denmark (if available
moisture levels are maintained), but decrease in
France and FRG (if there is reduced available
moisture resulting from higher temperatures)
(Santer, 1985; Parry et al., 1989). In the
Mediterranean region production may fall substan-

agreement between GC Ms as to how moisture levels
may change in eastern Europe, but reductions in
moisture would tend to reduce production (Farago,

In the USSR warming would enable production to
be increased near the present northern limit of
commercial winter wheat cultivation. Further south,
in the current major producing regions of Ukraine
and Kazakhstan, increases in moisture (which are
most uncertain) would also enable output of winter
wheat and maize to be increased (Pitovranov et al.,

the smaller opportunity for risk pooling across

result. If, on the contrary, there is little beneficial
direct CO, effect and climate changes are negative
for agricultural potential in all or most of the major
food-exporting areas, then the average costs of world
agricultural production could increase significantly.
These decreases or increases in production potential
could result in decreases or increases in costs
equivalent to perhaps over 10% of the value of
world agriculture. It should be emphasised, how-

drought in the major producing regions, the implica-

substantial. Figure 2.1 illustrates the change in
commodity prices that could occur as a result of
concurrent yield reductions of between 10% and

Assuming there were no other climatic effects on

indicated in Section 2.6.3 (above) a 1°C warming in

shifts are estimated to increase the farmed area
significantly in high mid latitude mountain environ-

Zealand (Yoshino et al.,1988; Salinger et al.,1989).
These shifts of the limit of the farmed area imply
major impacts on the semi-natural environment and

under pressure both from the upward advance of
more intensive agriculture and from afforestation

further reclamation (Pitovranov et al., 1988a; Squire

Australia (Santer, 1985; Pittock, personal communi-

advantage, then decisions may follow which involve
a change in use. The amount of land use change is
likely to depend on how finely land uses in a given

In particular there are likely to occur very many
alterations to the timing of various farm operations
such as of tillage (ploughing, sowing, harvesting etc),
of fertilising and of pest and weed control (spraying
etc), because the timing of these in the present
farming calendar, though of course different for
various parts of the world, is frequently affected by
present climate. Particular aspects of husbandry are
also likely to be affected, such as the density of
planting, the use of fallowing and mulching and the
extent of inter-cropping. These aspects are, today,
frequently part of a package of strategies designed to
mitigate the adverse effects (and exploit the benefi-

not possible from these data to conclude what
proportion of the population relies on forests and to
what degree, but there are similarities for all count-
ries. All countries use fuelwood for heating and
cooking to some extent. Ifthe availability of wood
is altered, the impacts will be most severe where
alternative energy supplies are limited.

ambient temperatures are the main driving force of
dormancy release. If early winter is mild, trees may
deharden and be damaged by frost in late winter.
Paradoxically, a milder climate may increase the risk
of frost damage. In general, the survival rhythm of
trees may be broken, particularly in the far north

intensively managed forest. There have been sug-

is the result of climatic changes in this portion of the

many habitats are isolated from the surrounding

to move, many species may be unable to survive in
their current habitats. As climate continues to

"Shifts in tree species ranges could be important for
several reasons (Moomaw, 1988). First, climate is
expected to change faster than tree species can
respond through migration. Second, new sites may
not be edaphically hospitable, having evolved over
thousands of years in a different environment.
Finally, future forest climate zones leading to new
forest ecosystems will not be related to current
administrative boundaries which are used to defined
wood supply areas, ownership, parks and nature
reserves. Forests in areas of projected large climatic
changes over the next 50 years will require massive
readjustments, with consequent increases in the area
of stressed forests (Smith and Tirpak, 1988).

"A variety of effects on forest productivity has been
discussed (Warrick et al., 1986; Booth and
McMurtrie, 1989). Increases are proposed in some
cases (Kauppi and Posch, 1985; 1987) and decreased
in others (eg Solomon and West, 1986). In stands
where a favourable combination of climatic changes,
site conditions, and stand composition and develop-
ment stage exists, productivity could be enhanced.
This would occur in a boreal stand on a wet site in
the northern part of the boreal climate. However,
productivity could decrease where moisture or
nutrients are strongly limiting, or where species are
already at their upper temperature or lower mois-
ture limits.

"Managed forests incorporate high levels of invest-
ment with the expectation of concomitant economic
returns. These forests have been established for
superior quality products: teak and mahogany in
tropical areas, radiata pine and Douglas fir in
temperate areas, and Scots pine and black spruce in
boreal forests. Impacts of climatic changes are
expected to be significant on these forests and
consequently on the associated economic and social
systems of the dependent regions. Countries with a
secure economic infrastructure will be less affected
economically than those which may depend to a
higher degree on forest products and have econo-

"For each 1°C of warming, tree ranges have the
potential to expand 100 km northward while
southern boundaries retreat, a process which has
been tracked quite accurately since the last glaci7
ation (Davis, 1989). The asynchrony will be greatest
in the disturbed plant communities. These lags will
persist a decade or two at most, then logging or fire
or both, will cause a rapid adjustment to the pre-
vailing climate. Intensively managed forests can
respond to actual changes in the environment, but
these could be out of synchrony with the environ-
ment unless proactive strategies are adopted that
capitalise on our knowledge of anticipated climates.
Depending on the rates of climatic change, stresses
could increase as the environment changes, and
without careful species-climate planning and alloca-
tion, the intensively managed forests could become
more and more out of tune with its environment.

two broad sets of regions appear most vulnerable to
climatic change: (i) some semi-arid tropical and

some regions as a result of 1° or 2°C increase in the
mean annual temperatures. Similarly, reductions in
average levels of soil moisture as a result of higher

tion, relatively small decreases in rainfall or
increases in évapotranspiration could markedly
increase both the risk and the intensity of drought in
currently drought-prone (and often food-deficient)
regions. Change in drought risk represents poten-

"Impacts on potential yields are likely to vary greatly
according to types of climatic change and types of

where summer drying may reduce productive poten-

by ca 10-30% under an equilibrium 2 x C 0, climate.
Towards the northern edge of current core produc-
ing regions, however, warming may enhance produc-
tive potential in climatic terms. When combined
with direct C0, effects, increased climatic potential
could be substantial - though in actuality it may be

productivity in different regions and under varying
types of management. To date, less than a dozen
detailed regional studies have been completed,
and these are insufficient as a basis for generalis-
ing about effects on food production at the re-
gional or world scale.

of changes in climate on other physical processes,
for example on rates of soil erosion and salinisa-
tion; on soil nutrient depletion; on pests, diseases
and soil microbes, and their vectors; on hydro-

logical conditions as they affect irrigation water

+ An improved ability is required to 'scale-up' our
understanding of effects on crops and livestock to
effects on farm production, on village production,
and on national and global food supply. This is
particularly important because policies must be
designed to respond to impacts at the national
and global levels. Further information is needed
on the effects of changes in climate on social and
economic conditions in rural areas (eg employ-

infrastructure, support services etc).

potentially effective technical adjustments at the

"Two observations may be made. First, the problems
of forest ecosystems are usually region-specific;
therefore, analyses of the impacts must be region-
specific. Universal issues include the conversion of
all-aged multispecies, natural closed forests to high-
yielding, intensively managed, mono-specific forests
or to other uses including; non-forest land use,
inadequately regenerated natural forest, or low-yield
managed plantations. The latter three conversions
often fall short of local needs in developing countries
and make forest product industries vulnerable to
fibre shortages while at the same time biodiversity is
reduced, wildlife habitat is degraded and carbon
emissions to the atmosphere increase.

"An initial assessment leads to the conclusion that
climatic changes are more likely to exacerbate these
issues and tensions than to reduce them. This
finding depends on the assumption that during the
next 30-50 years in response to climatic changes,
forests everywhere in the world will be sensitive to
some decline. If, forests in some regions are largely
unaffected by climatic changes, or subject to inten-
sive forest management resulting in increased growth
rates, then many of the statements in Table 2.5 will

apparent the necessity for strong and proactive

several years of variable weather.

Detailed regional climate scenarios are needed
for the development of forest impact studies (eg
see Gibbs and Hoffman, 1987; Cohen, 1989).
Studies of impacts must be global in scope,
international in organisation, institutional in focus
and historical in breadth.

Studies at the stand-level are a prerequisite for
credible socioeconomic assessments of forest-
sector responses to climate. Stand-response
studies require regional climate scenarios as
input, and should employ suitable stand-dynamics
simulators (eg Pastor and Post, 1985; 1986; 1988).

Better understanding of the relationship between
species and sites is required. Progress is being
made in identifying and mapping the climatically
suitable and sustainable areas for a wide variety
of tree species (eg Booth et al., 1989).

Improved knowledge is required concerning the
potential role of forest management at the man-
agement unit scale, in mitigating undesirable
impacts and capitalising on desirable impacts due
to climatic change. In industrial forests, manage-
ment units are composed of several thousand
stands and cover 10°-10° ha. Forest-level analyses
require inputs from stand-scale models employing
suitable forest-dynamics simulators (eg Attebring
et al., 1988; Wang et al., 1987).

Analyses are required at the regional-scale (10°
ha +) of the possible effects on wildlife habitat
and recreational potential resulting from climate-
induced forest-structure changes. These studies
require scenarios of the dynamics of wildlife
habitat, which can be developed using forest
simulators as noted above.

"This report examines the ecological impacts of
climate change on natural ecosystems (land areas
and associated flora and fauna which are not inten-
sively managed) and the socioeconomic conse-
quences of these impacts. For this report, the
definition of natural terrestrial ecosystems includes
unmanaged forests and other natural vegetation
systems, wetlands, deserts, freshwater lakes, alpine
regions and protected areas such as natural heritage
sites and reserves. It does not include intensively
managed ecosystems such as agricultural areas and
forest plantations (Chapter 2, Agriculture and
forestry) nor does it include components of the
terrestrial cryosphere (Chapter 7, Seasonal snow
cover, ice and permafrost).
"	Text
"Generally accepted vegetation zones (eg warm
desert, tropical forest, boreal forest and tundra) have
been used to stratify the discussions. Use of these
zones recognises the spatial resolution limitations of
the current understanding of global climate change
and the likely responses of ecosystems and their
components. Further stratification is achieved by
focusing discussion on major and sensitive compo-
nents of natural terrestrial ecosystems: biodiversity
and endangered species, unmanaged forests and
vegetation, wetlands, freshwater fisheries, wildlife
and heritage sites and reserves. Although the focus
will be on the larger scale (approximately 1000 km),
where available, local analyses will be used to
illustrate specific environmental impacts and socio-
economic consequences.

"The increases in the atmospheric concentrations of
GHG and the projected changes in climate resulting
from these increases pose a serious threat to natural
terrestrial ecosystems and associated socioeconomic
systems. It must be recognised that the temperature
changes suggested by climate scenarios would
present natural systems with a warmer climate than
has been experienced at least during the past
100,000 years (Schneider and Londer, 1984), and
that there is no equivalent during the period of
recent development of the present vegetation.
Moreover, a global temperature rise of 4°C above
the present norm, for example, would make the
earth its warmest since the Eocene, 40 million years
ago (Barron, 1985; Webb, 1990).
"	Text
"Such warming would not only be greater than recent
natural fluctuations, but it would occur 15 to 40
times faster than past natural changes (Schneider,
1989; Gleick et al., 1990). Such a rate of change
may exceed the ability of many species to adapt or
disperse into more favourable regions and many
plant and animal species may become extinct (Lester
and Myers, 1989; Pain, 1988). For widespread,
abundant species, such as the loblolly pine (Pinus
taeda) (Miller et al., 1987), even a substantial range
retraction might not threaten extinction; however,
rare localised species, whose entire ranges become
unsuitable, would be extinguished unless migration
or human interventions were successful. On the
other hand, some species, rare or abundant, may
thrive under a new climate regime. Even for widely
distributed species, major losses of important eco-
types and associated genetic material is likely (Davis
and Zabinski, 1990).

"The breeding success of birds and small mammals
(eg muskrats, beavers, weasels, reptilia, and amphi-
bians) are often linked to seasonal precipitation,
snow cover and snowmelt (eg Campbell, 1968; Davis
and Cook, 1983). Small alterations in the amount,
timing and intensity of precipitation events can
dramatically affect regional water balances, with
significant impacts on flora and fauna (Pain, 1988;
Kushlan, 1986).

"Although changes to natural terrestrial ecosystems
as a result of climate change are often viewed
negatively, many areas could benefit ecologically,
socially and/or economically from the suggested
changes. Recognising and responding to these
‘positive' effects, however, will pose some problems.
Difficulties will arise when trying to identify whether
or not a particular change (or combination of
changes) is having, or will have, beneficial effects on
an ecosystem. In addition, identifying the appropri-

"Increasing concentrations of GHG in the atmos-
phere pose two different sorts of stresses on natural
terrestrial ecosystems. In addition to causing chan-
ges in climate, GHG can directly affect ecosystem
processes, thereby influencing ecosystem health and
composition. Primarily affected are biological and
geomorphological processes (eg photosynthesis and
decomposition) which alter nutrient availability,
reproduction and biomass productivity. Changes in
these basic ecosystem processes alone can have a
significant impact on the composition and health of
the ecosystem through changes in competition,
habitat conditions and food availability.
"	Text
"Other factors, important in determining species
distribution and health, are expected to change in
response to the proposed global warming. Soil
chemistry could change (Kellison and Weir, 1987) as
a result of both climatic changes and of associated
changes in storm patterns that could alter soil
process, including leaching and erosion rates (Harte
et al., 1990). Sea-levels may rise, inundating coastal
biological communities (NRC, 1983; Hansen et al.,
1981; Hoffman et al., 1983; Titus et al., 1984).
Projected changes in fire frequency and severity,
particularly during ecosystem transitional periods,
could alter the structure of ecosystems and play a
dominant role in species dispersal.

"1987; Schlesinger and Mitchell, 1987) and for many
species, precipitation and soil moisture are more
important determinants of survival than temperature.
Indeed, except at the treeline, where minimum
temperature is often the dominant limiting factor,
precipitation plays a major role in determining the
distribution of vegetation with trees occurring mainly
where annual amounts are in excess of 300 mm
(Woodward, 1990). Complicating this response is
the fact that enhanced levels of atmospheric C0,
increases the water use efficiency of plants (Gifford,
1979). Therefore, although precipitation character-
istics are expected to change, plants' efficiency in the
use of the available moisture will also change.
"	Text
"An important point in understanding species' re-
sponse to climate change, is that weather is variable
and extreme events, like droughts, frosts, floods,
blizzards, the frequency of hot or cold spells and
associated fires and pest outbreaks, may have more
effect on species distributions than average climate
(eg Knopfand Sedgwick, 1987). Animals can adapt
their behaviour during droughts and heatwaves by
timing activity to cooler parts of the day, restricting
their movements to conserve energy and water, or
migrating to more favourable areas. Increased
frequency or persistence of these conditions, how-
ever, can significantly influence an animal's health
and survival either directly or indirectly through loss
of habitat, food and water.
"	Text
"In addition, many wildlife species have become
increasingly dependent on habitats modified by
people. Their responses to climatic changes, there-
fore, will, in many cases, be reactions to human
responses (eg changes in land use and urban devel-
opment) which are also affected by climatic changes
(Burger, 1984). Moreover, encroachment, barriers
and habitat destruction by humans, with no analog
to past periods of climate change, would probably
place populations of many species in jeopardy.
Topping and Bond (1988) and Lester and Myers
(1989) maintain that the direct physical and physio-
logical effects of an increase in air and water tem-
perature on wildlife will be less significant than the
indirect effects such as habitat transformation,
wetland loss, salt marsh intrusion, estuarine changes
and loss of food sources.
"	Text
"Another factor to be taken into consideration when
examining the impacts of climate change on natural
terrestrial ecosystems is the manner by which chan-
ges to ecosystems can affect the climate (ie through
feedback mechanisms). There are at least two such
feedback mechanisms. One relates to the fact that
changes in ecosystems can alter the albedo and
hydrological characteristics of an area, thereby
affecting the local energy and water balance. The
second mechanism is a result of the manner in
which gases are exchanged between the biosphere
and the atmosphere. Ecosystems can either enhance
the greenhouse effect by increasing their emissions
of certain gases (eg methane), or decreasing their
effectiveness as a sink for these gases (Steudler et
al., 1989). These feedback mechanisms are dealt
with in detail by Working Group I, Subgroup X.

migration routes will have important consequences
which may escape explanation until events over all

"Inferences about the impacts of elevated GHG and
an altered climate on natural terrestrial ecosystems
have come from four sources: (i) analysis of the
current bioclimatic distributions of vegetation types
and their possible future distributions as climatic
patterns change (direct transfer function approach);
(ii) analyses of historical vegetational changes under
past climatic conditions (palaeoreconstruction
approach); (ili) simulation modelling of ecosystems
at a stand level; and (iv) reasoning from a know-
ledge of the ecophysiology of dominant plant species
and associated growth-chamber experiments and
knowledge of the ecological requirements of animal
species. Each of these methods of inferring impacts
has its strengths and weaknesses. What would be
useful but is lacking, however, are long-term obser-
vations of the response of ecosystems to altered
GHG (Occhel, 1989) and climatic conditions outside
the controlled research environment. This also
includes field experiments involving transplanting of
intact vegetation mats from colder to warmer vege-
tation zones and in areas with high topographical
diversity. In the absence of such information,
scientists are left with very imperfect means of
assessments, particularly of the secondary and
combined influences of several stressors (eg climate,
fire and air pollution) on the interacting components
of ecosystems (vegetation, wildlife, pests and patho-
gens, soil nutrients, and water and air quality).

"Insight into long-term responses to large climatic
changes can be gleaned from studies of fossil distri-
butions of, particularly, pollen (Davis, 1983) and
small mammals (Graham, 1986). Such observations
tell us that plants and animals are sensitive to
climate. Their ranges move when the climate
patterns change - species die out in areas where they
were once found and colonise new areas where the
climate becomes more suitable. Based on palaco-
reconstruction scenarios, however, future changes in
climate will have strongly diverging impacts on
natural terrestrial ecosystems rather than unequivo-
cal tendencies.

"The manner and the intensity in which ecosystems
respond to changes in climate differ from ecosystem
to ecosystem and from species to species. Some
species will benefit and others will risk extinction
(Topping and Bond, 1988). Historical evidence
suggests that in those situations where the changes
in climate were dramatic (ie changes were large,
long lasting or occurred relatively quickly), the
responses of ecosystems were relatively well defined.
Less pronounced changes in climate have caused
regionally different, sometimes retarded, reactions by
ecosystems, and in still other cases, had no impact at
all (eg the responses of ecosystems in northern

"Simulation models are a limited tool because they
are vastly simplified representations of ecosystem
processes involved. In addition, they generally do
not examine interactions at a landscape level (eg
migration, dispersal, fire, pest and pathogen spread,
substrate change), nor do they incorporate interac-
tive effects of changing fire frequency, air quality,
elevated GHG and pest potential on a multispecies
perennial community. Some research has begun to
move in that direction (eg Pastor and Post, 1988;
Malanson and Westman, in press), but results of
sophisticated models are some years away. Further-
more, full validation of model results cannot be
achieved until the results of long-term studies in a
field setting are available.

altered climate and altered GHG are not con-

other factors such as wildfire frequency, air pollu-
tion, herbivory and pathogenicity are not considered
(these interactive effects may be particularly critical
during periods of rapid ecosystem transition); (iv)
the impacts of barriers to migration, including
urbanisation and topographical barriers and differing
substrate (ie soil) types in the new locations, are not
considered; and (v) differing rates of species dispers-
al and migration can result in shifting assemblages.
In this last case, key pollinators, symbiots, or other
critical link species, may be absent, resulting in
impoverished and possibly less stable communities.
"	Text
"The use of palaeoreconstruction scenarios to infer
potential responses is limited since (i) the projected
amount and rate of climate change are unprecedent-
ed, (ii) CO, variations, although occurring in the
past, were not the causes of these past climatic
changes; (iii) given dating uncertainty, data from the
Hypsithermal are from a 2000-year or longer time
interval; and (iv) the actual mean global temperature
6000 years bp, 125,000 years bp or in the Pliocene of
1°C, 2°C and 3°C are only rough estimates at this
time. Furthermore, the suggested climatic changes
will occur along with other pressures (eg air and
water pollution, and human population growth) that
are unprecedented in earlier periods of climate
history. This suggests that palaeo-based scenarios
for species migration may give relevant indications
of the mechanisms and patterns of dispersal but not
of the rate.

"The response of biota to climate change can be
inferred by observing present and past distributions
of plants and animals, which are sensitive to critical
levels of heat and moisture (Colinvaux, 1986). For
example, one race of the dwarf birch (Betula nana)
can grow only where the temperature never exceeds
22°C (Ford, 1982), suggesting that it would disap-
pear from much of its range when global warming
causes temperatures to exceed this limit. Recent
historical observations of changes in range of species
dominance, such as observations of the gradual
replacement ofred spruce (Picea rubens) by decidu-
ous species during the past 180 years in the eastern
US (Hamburg and Cogbill, 1988), can be used to
suggest future responses of the observed species to
changes in climate. It must also be recognised that
over the long term, climatic change may trigger
genetic responses, creating divergent races of species
to respond to newly evolving niches.

"The use of the existing hypotheses to predict eco-
system responses is limited because of the small
database on which they are founded. No study of
plant responses to enhanced ambient C 0 , concentra-
tion have used domestic species with the results
extrapolated to natural species and a length of
exposure limited to days or one growing season.
Recent studies (eg Oechel, 1989, working in the
tussock tundra at Toolik Lake in Alaska) have found
that vegetation may rapidly adjust to elevated C0,
with the initial increases in photosynthetic rate
decreasing and returning to near-normal levels over
time.

"A wide range of possible responses by natural
terrestrial ecosystems to enhance ambient CO,
concentrations have been hypothesised including, for
some plants and organisms, increased photosynthesis
rates, growth rates, productivity and water use
efficiency. When the ambient C0, concentration
changes, the physiological responses of plants and
organisms to other factors, including climatic chan-
ges can be modified. Improved water and nutrient
use efficiency of some species of trees due to elevat-
ed CO, in the atmosphere, for example, may amelio-
rate their projected decline and mortality. These

"The potential positive effects of C0, enrichment
may be reduced by other anthropogenic-caused
changes in atmospheric chemistry (eg ozone),
ecosystem feedbacks, competition for limited nutri-
ents and/or water, and the influence of temperature
on photosynthesis and respiration. Izrael and
Semenov (1990), for example, found that observed
increases in productivity as a result of enhanced C0,
concentrations cannot be suppressed only by en-
hanced levels of ozone (ozone pollution levels used
are similar to those currently found in industrial
areas of North America and Europe) but also could
override their projected increases and result in
significant decreases in productivity.

"Responses similar to those mentioned above can be
expected during the next 50-100 years as an early
response to projected climatic changes, including
disruption of natural community and extinction of
population and species. Even many animal species
that are currently widespread could experience large
range changes. Efficient dispersers may be able to
shift their ranges to take advantage of newly suitable
habitat, but most species will at best experience a
time lag before extensive colonisation is possible,
and hence in the short term may shown range
diminishment. At worst, many species will never be
able to recover without human intervention since
migration routes are cut off by development (eg
farm fences, fields, highways and other barriers) or
other human-caused habitat loss (Lewis, 1987).

"Carbon, an element essential to life, is primarily
available to terrestrial plants (and other organisms)
in the form of atmospheric C0,. Increased concen-
tration of atmospheric C0,, especially where it is a
limiting factor can modify the physiological behav-
iour of plants. The nature of plant responses to
enhance ambient C 0, concentration is quite complex
(see Working Group I Report, Ecosystems, for
detailed discussions) with first-order and second-
order effects. First-order effects include (Strain and
Cure, 1985) potential impacts on photosynthesis,
respiration, water use efficiency, reproduction,
tolerance to salinity, and growth rates (C0, fertilisa-
tion) and form. The second-order effects include
plant-to-plant interactions (eg competition and
symbiosis), plant-to-animal interactions (eg
herbivory, pollination and shelter) and plant-to-

range, is often insufficient for an accurate prediction
of a change in geographic range in response to
climatic changes. Because of the complexity of the
determining factors, species' and their ecosystems'
responses will not be simple. They will vary from a
progressive, uniform dispersion to sudden spurts
with great leaps forward (Mooney and Drake, 1989).

adapt to change more than others depending, among
other factors, on the strength of the controlling
climatic factor relative to other controlling factors;
on the relative status of each vegetation type in the

"During several Pleistocene interglacials, the mean
annual temperature in North America was apparent-
ly 2°-3°C higher than now. Sweet gum trees
(Liquidambar) grew in southern Ontario (Wright,
1971); Osage oranges (Madura) and _ papaws
(Asimina) grew several hundred kilometres north of
their present distributions; manatees swam in New
Jersey; and tapirs and peccaries foraged in North
Carolina (Dorf, 1976). During the last of these
interglacials, which ended more than 125,000 years
bp, vegetation in northwestern Europe, which is now
taiga, was predominantly temperate forest
(Critchfield, 1980). Other significant changes in
species' ranges have been caused by altered precipi-

expansion of prairie in the American Midwest during

"Past vegetation regions have shifted in response to
temperature changes of a similar magnitude as that
which is expected to occur during the next 100 years
or less (Baker 1983; Bernabo and Webb, 1977;
Butzer, 1980; Flohn, 1979; Muller, 1979; Van
Devender and Spaulding, 1979; CO HMA P members,
1988). These migrations, however, occurred over
thousands of years rather than within a few decades
as projected climatic changes may necessitate. In
the past, as the earth warmed, species tended to
migrate to higher latitudes, colonising new habitats
closer to the poles (Payette and Filion, 1985), often
while their ranges contracted away from the equator
as conditions there became unsuitable and other
species migrated to these areas. Studies indicate,
however, that species can spread in any direction
once they become established in a particular region
(Birks, 1989).

"One response of natural terrestrial ecosystems to
changes in climate and GHG concentrations is to
change the distribution of flora and fauna. This is
essentially a two-step process; first, the climate zone
will shift, and conditions for species may become
more or less favourable; second, the species may
follow the climatic region. The time lags in each of
the two steps between cause and effect could be
short or long, ranging from a few years or decades
to a century. The shorter the lag, the less ability
species will have to adapt and the greater the
potential impacts and associated socioeconomic
consequences. It should be understood that abiotic
factors such as climate, are not the only determinant
of whether or not a species exists at a particular
location. Such factors as how well as a species is
established, competition, predators and prey, and the
viability of invading species, and how these are also
influenced by climatic change need also to be
considered. Not surprisingly, species tend to track
their climatic zones, retracting their ranges where
conditions become unsuitable while expanding them
where conditions improve (Peters and Darling, 1985;
Ford, 1982). Even very small temperature changes
within this century have been observed to cause
substantial range changes for certain species (Ford,
1982; Kullman, 1983).

soil moisture may impair chances for survival and
reproduction. Coniferous seedlings, for example, are
injured by soil surface temperatures over 45°C,
although other types of plants can tolerate much
higher temperatures (Daubenmire, 1962). Many
plants have their northern limits determined by
minimum temperature isotherms below which some
key physiological process does not occur. For
instance, the grey hair grass (Corynephorus
canescens) is largely unsuccessful at germinating
seeds below 15°C and is bounded to the north by
the 15°C July mean isotherm (Marshall, 1978).

"Another aspect of species response is that species
may shift altitudinally as well as latitudinally. When
the climate warms, species may shift to higher
elevations. Generally, a short rise in altitude corres-
ponds to a major shift in latitude (3°C cooling over
500 m in elevation equals roughly 250 km in latitude
(MacArthur, 1972)). Thus, during the middle
Holocene (hypsithermal) 6000 years bp, when
temperatures in eastern North America were 2°C
warmer than at present, hemlock {Tsuga canadensis)
and white pine (Pinus strobus) were found 350 m
higher on mountains than they are today (Davis,

"While individual species tend to shift in the same
general direction, entire biological communities do
not move in synchrony. On the contrary, since
species shift at different rates in response to climate
change, communities often disassociate into their
component species. Recent studies of fossil packrat
{Neotoma spp.) middens in the southwestern US
show that during the wetter, warmer climate of
22,000-12,000 years bp, there was no concerted shift
of plant communities as a whole. Instead, species
responded individually to climatic change, forming
stable but, by present-day standards, unusual assem-
blages of plants and animals (Van Devender and
Spaulding, 1979). In eastern North America, too,
post-glacial communities were often ephemeral
associations of species, changing as individual ranges
changed (Davis, 1983; Graham, 1986).

"Many animals have the potential to react quickly to
environmental changes; however, the responses of
associated plant communities can be relatively slow,
causing loss and fragmentation of habitat (Peters
and Darling, 1985; Arnold, 1985) with existing
problems of habitat loss becoming more serious
(Topping and Bond, 1988). Natural physical barriers
such as mountain ranges, large bodies of water and
deserts can also restrict movement of species. In
these cases migration is not a viable alternative. For
example, the Yucatan Peninsula is essentially a
biogeographical trap in which extinction rates could
be abnormally high should suggested changes in
climate occur. Suggested wetter conditions over the
Yucatan Peninsula (Menchaca and Byrne, 1990)
would effectively eliminate areas of seasonally dry
woodlands and scrub. This trend towards a wetter
climate could also lead to the extinction of the more

and many tropical deep-forest birds simply do not

barriers to dispersal are present, extinction may

This includes animals that migrate great distances on

Britain during the Holocene, tree-species migration
reached 700 m/year with minimal dispersal distances
up to 10 km per generation (Birks, 1989). In the
current context of scenarios of rapid climatic chan-

extinction has occurred because species were unable
to disperse rapidly enough when climate changed

(Liriodendron), magnolia (Magnolia), moonseed
(Menispermum), hemlock (Tsuga), arbor vitae
(Thuja), and white cedar (Chamaecyparis), had a
circumpolar distribution in the Tertiary (Tralau,

extinct in Europe while surviving in North America,
presumably because of the east-west orientation of
such barriers as the Pyrenees, Alps, and _ the
Mediterranean, which blocked southward migration
(Tralau, 1973).

"Although some species, such as plants propagated by
spores or 'dust' seeds, may be able to match these
rates (Perring, 1965), many species probably could
not disperse fast enough to compensate for the
proposed climate change without human assistance
(Rapoport, 1982), particularly given the presence of
dispersal barriers. Contrary to migration of species
during previously warm periods, modern species!
migration may be severely restricted by human land
uses which have created significant barriers. An
additional factor is that suitable habitat are infre-

surrounding agricultural land. It is unlikely, there-

a substrate will be impacted by projected climatic

Although adaptable, loss of sca ice and ice scals
would place the survival of polar bears at risk.
Walruses’ (Odobenus rosmarus) responses to climat-

wider ranges of habitat and food they would appear
to be less susceptible to adverse impacts. On the

since there will be a period of transition during
which fluxes will be somewhat variable. A draw-

exposure of wetland sediment and increase aerobic

ened by shoreline development (Breckenridge, 1988;
Harington, 1986). Other researchers, however,
suspect that the impacts on bird population could be
calamitous, as finely calibrated hatching and nurtur-
ing patterns may no longer be synchronised. For
example, the emergence of young must be closely
timed with the availability of food (Lester and
Myers, 1989; Pain, 1988b). Disruption of feeding
patterns could affect survival of the next generation
(Topping and Bond, 1988). The US Fish and
Wildlife Service (1988) foresees losses among Arctic
nesting shore birds, due to disruption of hatching
which is currently timed to the availability of food,
but notes the possibility of population gains for
nesting geese and seabirds responding to more
favourable temperatures and increases in their food.

is suffering, clearcutting followed by appropriate
reforestation (eg an alternative species or mix) may
be a viable option for some species (not for hard-
woods). In those situations where the current forest
stand continues to be healthy (ecologically, socially
and economically), consideration should be given to
restricting harvesting to selective cutting. This would
help maintain the existing forest climate, reduce the
disruption caused by stresses imposed by climatic
change, and maintain the ecosystem, especially for
some hardwood species. In addition, the likelihood
of fires and fire intensity should be considered in
managing debris and removal of deadwood.

"Changes in wetland numbers, type and distribution
can affect the social and economic values based on
these areas. Several studies have provided economic
analyses of wetland values (eg Morzer-Bruijns and
Westhoff, 1968; Gosselink et al., 1974; Raphael and
Jaworski, 1981; Thibodeau, 1981; Farber and
Costanza, 1986). Despite methodological problems,
without exception these have demonstrated not only
the significant magnitude of, but also the variety of,
benefits derived from wetland areas. The values are
often remarkably high; for example, the capitalised
values for mangrove wetlands have been given as
$US212,507/ha (Thorhaug and Miller, 1986) and
$US81,975/ha (Logo and Brinson, 1979). Values
calculated for other wetlands have even been higher

In any case, the potential for economic loss may be
substantial.

"Changes in habitat and the availability of food and
water will increase pressures on animals and may
lead to many animals having to migrate and/or
disperse over larger areas. In the case of endan-
gered species, dispersal could be disastrous. For
those species for which numbers are already low,
reproductive potential will decline as the number of
times that males and females meet during periods
when fertilisation is possible decreases. In the case
of herding animals, dispersal could lead to tradition-
ally non-dominating males fertilising the females,
thereby reducing the genetic health of the population
(Cubberly, 1989). Clearly, anything which adversely
affects the already threatened species such as the
African elephant (population 400-600 thousand) and
the black rhino (population less than 3000) are of
great economic concern. McNeely (1989) estimates

The more fragmented and the smaller populations

Thus, one direction in the short term is to mini-
mise further encroachment of development upon
existing natural ecosystems. Meanwhile, efforts to
improve techniques for managing communities
and ecosystems under stress, and also for restor-
ing them when necessary, must be carried forward
energetically.

In the near term, the critical needs of natural
terrestrial ecosystems which face the most delet-
erious impacts should be addressed. Humans
must be prepared to intervene where vital eco-
systems or species are in jeopardy. Priority
should be given to considering the various re-

and risks. Consideration should also be given to
reducing major human-caused stresses such as
logging, subsistence domestic animal grazing and
pollution-causing activities. Often, once these
stresses, which may originate outside the boundar-

"hypothetical (or prescribed) scenarios, (2) scenarios
obtained from atmospheric general circulation
models (GCM), and (3) scenarios based on
historical and palaeoclimatic reconstructions.
"	Text
"The first approach is to prescribe climatic changes
for various regions or river basins in a simplified
manner. As a rule, such scenarios specify air tem-
perature increases from 0.5°C to 4.0°C and precipi-
tation changes (increase or decrease) in the range of
10% to 25%. Some authors also prescribe hypo-
thetical changes in evaporation.
"	Text
"Higher temperatures may also have an impact in the
transitional winter snow zones. More winter precipi-
tation would be in the form of rain instead of snow,
thereby increasing winter season runoff and decreas-
ing spring and summer snowmelt flows. Where the
additional winter runoff cannot be stored because of
flood control considerations or lack of adequate
storage, a loss in usable supply would be the result.
"	Text
"There are difficulties and limitations in the applica-
tion of palaeoclimatic reconstructions owing to the
uncertainty of the climatic conditions of the remote
past and to the lack of reliable palaeoclimatic data
for many regions and countries. There is also a
continuing discussion of the relative merits of the
three approaches. In the absence of reliable predic-
tions, the question of which scenario is best remains
unanswered.
"	Text
"Forecasts of changes in climatic conditions for
different regions and periods of time are required to
estimate the hydrologic effects of increasing trace
gas concentrations in the atmosphere. Air tempera-
ture, precipitation, cloud cover or insolation, wind
speed and humidity are the most important condi-
tions. However, reliable forecasts of regional
climate change are unavailable. In their absence,
various approaches to the development of scenarios
of future climatic conditions are used, including (1)
"	Text
"Climate change can be expected to lead to changes
in soil moisture and water resources. The most
important climate variable that may change is
regional precipitation, which cannot be predicted
well. Water supply and use in semi-arid lands are
very sensitive to small changes in precipitation and
evapotranspiration by vegetation, because the frac-
tion of precipitation that runs off or percolates to
groundwater is small. Increased heat will lead to
more evapotranspiration, but the increase is expect-
ed to be partly offset by reduced plant water use in
a COj-enriched atmosphere.
"	Text
"Changes in climatic conditions due to increasing
atmospheric concentrations ofradiatively active trace
gases will probably alter land and water resources,
their distribution in space and time, the hydrologic
cycle of water bodies, water quality, and water
supply systems and requirements for water resources
in different regions. Quantitative estimates of the
hydrologic effects of climate change are essential for
understanding and solving potential water resource
problems associated with domestic water use, indus-
try, power generation, agriculture, transportation,
future water resources systems planning and man-
agement, and protection of the natural environment.
"	Text
"The second approach is to obtain scenarios directly
from GC Ms in which the atmospheric concentration
of C0, is doubled (2x CO,). A problem with using
GCMs is that the simulations for the same regions
by different climate models may yield different and
sometimes opposite results, especially for precipita-
tion changes (Gleick, 1988).The third approach is to
develop future climate analogs based on climatic
reconstructions of past warm epochs, when atmos-
pheric CO. was above the present value. For
instance, Soviet climatologists show in their studies
(Budyko and Izrael, 1987) that the so-called
Holocene optimum (about 5-6 KA) can be con-
sidered as a 1°C global warming analog (about in
the year 2000-2005); the last interglacial epoch (the
Mikulino, 125 KA) can serve as an analog of the
climatic conditions with a 2°C warming in the year
2020-2025; and the Pliocene climatic optimum that
took place a few million years ago, with mean air
temperatures 3°C-4°C above present, can be an
analog of climatic conditions for the more distant
future years 2040-2050.

(1989) for the USSR, Griffiths (1989) for New

"(iv) Use of deterministic hydrologic models. In this
approach, rainfall-runoff models for river basins are
employed with climatological data sets, including
GCM outputs, to determine changes in hydrologic
conditions. This approach was used by many
authors for the basins located in various hydroclima-
tic environments (Nemec and Schaake, 1982; Gleick,
1986, 1987; Mather and Feddema, 1986; Cohen,
"	Text
"The results obtained in hydrologic simulations based
on different GCMs are inconsistent for certain
important hydrologic conditions and regions. This
can be attributed to the low resolution of the current
generation of GCMs, and to their simplified descrip-
tion of hydrologic processes. Nevertheless, the
approach is very promising and studies of this type
should be continued.
"	Text
"Deterministic hydrologic models have some desir-
able properties. They allow explicit study of causal
relations in the climate-water resources system for
estimating the sensitivity of river basins to changing
climatic conditions. In addition, when regional
climatic forecasts are available, possible runoff
changes in different hydroclimatic environments may
be simulated for water planning and management.
"	Text
"In the US, the first major assessment of
climate-runoff relations was conducted by Langbein
et al. (1949), who produced a set of rainfall-runoff
curves widely used in crude impact studies. These
relations were tested and updated by Karl and
Riebsame (1989), based on an analysis of actual
climate fluctuations over 90 undisturbed drainages.
They found that runoff was less sensitive to tempera-
ture changes than suggested by Langbein and his
colleagues.
"	Text
"(iii) Use of atmospheric GCMs. In this approach,
GCMs with prescribed increases in the concentra-
tions of trace gases in the atmosphere (usually
2xC0O,) are used to obtain direct estimates of
changes in the climatic and hydrologic characteristics
for large regions. For example, possible changes in
runoff, soil moisture, and evaporation have been
estimated for the US and Canada using GCMs
(USEPA, 1984; Sanderson and Wong, 1987; and
Singh, 1987).
"	Text
"The first and second methods have been widely
applied to estimate changes in water resources over
large areas because a relatively small amount of
initial data is required, usually annual runoff, pre-
cipitation, and air temperature. Caution should be
exercised in extrapolating regression relationships
over past years to future periods. One cannot
assume that a past interannual pattern of meteoro-
logical factors will be repeated in the future. It is
also true that for the same annual precipitation and
temperature, annual runoff can widely vary, depend-
ing on the distribution of the meteorological vari-

"(i) Analysis of long-term variations in runoff and
meteorological elements over past periods. This
method can be approached in two ways. The first
consists of statistical analyses of the relations be-
tween runoff, air temperature, and precipitation.
This approach has been used by Stockton and
Boggess (1979) and Revelle and Waggoner (1983)
for western regions of the US and the Colorado
River basin, and by Polyak and Speranskaya (1987)
for annual river runoff in the USSR. The second
way is to study the hydrologic consequences of past
periods of very warm or cold, wet or dry conditions.
Such analyses have been carried out by Schwarz
(1977) and Glantz (1988) for the US, by Liu (1989)
for northern China, and by Demaree and Nicolis
(1990) for the Sahelian region.

"Investigations highlight the great sensitivity of river
watersheds to even small changes in climatic condi-

regions are especially sensitive because annual runoff
is highly variable. For watersheds where snowmelt
is an important source of runoff, annual runoff and
its seasonal distribution is vulnerable both to chan-
ging air temperature and to changing precipitation.
In middle latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere with
a 1°C or 2°C warming, the winter runoff is expected
to increase drastically and spring high water to be
lower owing to earlier snowmelt (see Section 4).

"Since extreme meteorological events cannot be
explicitly forecast by G C M simulations, nor by using
palaeoclimatic analogs, in practice the quantitative
regional estimates of possible changes in runoff
extremes are as yet unavailable. Nevertheless, there
are plenty of qualitative estimates, based usually on
an assumption about the proportionality of changes
in runoff extremes to those in annual, seasonal or
monthly runoff (see Section 5). More reliable
conclusions about the runoff extremes in various
regions of the world could be drawn if detailed
quantitative estimates of changes in meteorological
characteristics over shorter periods of time were

"Many estimates of runoff change due to global
climate warming, including those given in Sections 4
and 5 do not consider the possible direct influence
of increased C0, on évapotranspiration (with in-
creased CO, concentration évapotranspiration
usually decreases). This phenomenon is considered
in Idso and Brazel (1984) for five US river basins as
well as in Aston (1987) for river basins in Australia.
In these studies, the results were opposite to those
obtained by other researchers, namely, a doubling of
CO, concentration brought about a 40% to 60%
increase in annual runoff for US rivers in question,
and that for Australian rivers by 60% to 80%.
Wigley and Jones (1985) and Palutikof (1987)
pointed out to the great role of taking into account
the direct C0, effects on ¢vapotranspiration and
total evaporation, which is ignored by many re-

"The relation between water consumption and avail-
able water is illustrated in Figure 4.1 which shows
per capita water consumption in the year 2000 and
a dryness index R,/LP (where R, is the radiation
balance of a wet surface, P is the precipitation, and
L is the latent heat of condensation). The greater
the dryness index, the higher the specific water
consumption. The relations depicted in Figure 4.1
are derived for large natural-economic regions of the
world by estimating future water consumption in
various countries up to the end of the century under
stable climatic conditions (Shiklomanov and
Markova, 1986; Shiklomanov, 1988, 1989b). Using
these graphs and knowing possible changes in
climatic parameters with global warming, it is easy
to estimate approximate changes in total water
demands in different world regions. GCM simula-

estimations to be made for regional changes in the

"A measure of this amplification is elasticity; the ratio
of the relative change in a runoff variable to the
relative change in a climate variable. To illustrate
this point, maps showing the percentage change in
mean annual runoff to a 10% change in precipitation
and potential évapotranspiration are presented in
Figure 4.3. Elasticities as high as 5 were found in
the southeastern US. The study concluded that: dry
climates are more sensitive to change than humid
climates; elasticity to precipitation change is greater
than to évapotranspiration change; low flows will be
more affected than high flows; reservoir yields will
be affected, but the elasticity of reservoir yield is less
than the elasticity of the mean flow; and, because
water quality problems tend to be coupled with low
flow conditions, water quality effects may prove to
be among the most significant, especially in arid
areas.In 1984, the US Environmental Protection
Agency (USEPA, 1984) used output from GCMs
directly for analysing changing precipitation, soil
moisture, and runoff under doubled atmospheric
C0, conditions. The results indicated a significant
increase (20%-60%) in river runoff in the north-
western US, and a decrease (26%) in the central
region. Manabe and Wetherald (1986) obtained
similar results using a GC M to estimate soil mois-
ture changes in the mid-continent region of the US.
In contrast, however, simulations with other GCMs
produced opposite results for the same region
(Schlesinger and Mitchell, 1987; Mitchell and

2x CO, in the atmosphere. Simulation of hydro-
logic impacts was carried out with a water-balance
basin model with a monthly time increment. These
simulations showed increased winter runoff from
16% to 81% and decreased summer runoff from
30% to 68%. These results can be explained by a
drastic change in snowfall and snowmelt conditions
associated with a rising air temperature. A similar
approach has been used by other authors. With
doubling atmospheric C 0,, Great Lakes basin runoff
decreased by 12-13% (Sanderson and Wong, 1987),

effects of a climatic warming for Canada over the
coming decades. Most of these studies have based
their impacts on climatic simulations produced by
the GISS, GFDL, and UK MO GCMs (Marta, 1989).
A summary of the results of these studies is present-

on one of three distinct areas in the south-central
part of the nation: the Great Lakes, James Bay, and
the Saskatchewan River sub-basin. A nationwide
study of broad Canadian regions has also been
completed. In the Great Lakes region, GCM-
simulated temperatures range from +3.1°C -
+4.8°C. The simulations for precipitation are much
more variable, ranging from -3% to +8%. General-
ly speaking, the mix of this range of conditions could
portend a decline in the hydrologic and water
resource base or the region. Under these tempera-
ture and precipitation conditions, runoff to the lakes
is estimated to decrease between 8% and 11%, lake
levels could drop between 21 cm and 59 cm, and
water supplies could fall from 18% to 21%.

"Farther north, in the James Bay region, the water
resource picture appears more favourable.
Model-simulated temperature increases for this area
fall in the range of 3.5°C to 4.7°C, with precipitation
estimated more narrowly to increase from between
15% to 17.5%. This range of climatic conditions
favours increases in runoff ranging from 8% to 16%
with concomitant increases in water supply of 9% to
22%. Moving west onto the Canadian Prairie,
impacts on the hydrology of the Saskatchewan River
sub-basin appear to be strongly model-dependent.
Both the GISS and GFDL simulations indicate
impacts of fairly large magnitude, especially in terms
of changes in the timing, location, duration and
extent of runoff as well as soil moisture. However,
the GISS simulations indicate increasing streamflows
and water supplies for the region while the GFDL
simulations indicate decreases. In terms of net basin
supply, incorporating projected consumptive use, the
GISS simulation produced a range of increases
varying from 29% to 40%. On the other hand, the
GFDL simulation produced declines in net basin

supply ranging from 27% to 70% (Cohen et al,

"The impacts of climate change on water resources
have been classified by da Cunha into three groups:
economic, social, and environmental. Economic
impacts are often the most relevant. The changes in
the global amount of water resources available and
in the space and time distribution of these resources
may lead to water shortages and cause water price
increases. Changes in water quality are also likely as
a result of climatic change. Temperature increases
would also induce an increase in the demand for
water, thus contributing to a worsening situation
resulting from a decrease in water availability. The
negative impacts are expected to be particularly
serious on cultivated land areas. Examples of these
negative impacts include crop losses or shortages,
replacement of present agricultural species by other
species more resistant to water shortage but less
useful, increased activity of insects and predators,
and the abandonment of agricultural land. Such
impacts may also affect livestock by reducing herd
sizes and increasing disease and problems of vector
control. Other economic impacts relate to losses in
timber production, fisheries, and recreational busi-
nesses. Important indirect impacts include sedimen-
tation processes, ie erosion, transport and deposition
of sediments, as well as agriculture, hydraulic work
operations, and estuarine and coastal areas.

would probably increase over most of the UK in a
warmer world, with the greatest increase in the
north. The actual increase in runoff is very sensitive
to the estimated increase in precipitation (more so
than to changes in évapotranspiration). It is import-
ant to note that alterations in annual runoff due to
climatic change may approach changes in runoff due
to major land use change. Gross et al. (1989) used
a conceptual rainfall-runoff model to show, for
example, that clearing the forest in a small basin in
upland Wales could produce an increase in annual

The data in the table imply that if temperatures

annual rainfall of 140 mm (14% on an initial value

Subsequently, as the climatic predictions were

2000, and 2020. This procedure was repeated for
other regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The
results of these simulations are presented in the

"In terms of water use, a number of effects were
identified. In general, water demand is expected to
increase, while water supply decreases, spreading
localised water shortages to broader regions or to
the nation as a whole. Reduced precipitation and the
associated reduction in discharge can be expected to
reduce both the amount and regularity of hydroelec-
tric power generation. In the particular case of
rivers dependent upon snowmelt, the impact could
be quite significant. Moreover, contamination due
to salt-water intrusion could lead to acute
agricultural and municipal water supply problems.
Reduced water levels in rivers and lakes could also
produce deleterious effects on navigation and recrea-
tional activities.Finally, with respect to water quality,
the expectation is that river water quality will decline
with decreases in minimum flow. Lake quality could
be threatened by a prolonged state of thermal
stratification, and increasing temperatures may lead
to increased eutrophication. It is also thought that
declines in the water level and storage capacity of
lakes and dams could adversely affect water quality,

a reduction in lake carrying capacity could possibly

increased flushing rates and higher water levels.
Anoxic conditions are likely in some lakes, while
those already anoxic will probably have the period

groundwater recharge and reduced demand for

frequency of southeasterly storms under climate

of other unique impacts are also likely. For exam-

siltation in the cave may increase; a significant
increase in water yield from Pinus rodiafa-forested

power station may be affected by increased river
temperatures (discharges are already limited by
temperature restrictions in the summer), although
increased river flows may compensate to some

Droughts are likely to increase and major aridity
problems may prevail in downland areas particularly
in central and eastern regions. Eastern areas may
also experience a greater and an earlier demand for
irrigation water, while forested areas there will
supply a reduced water surplus to stream flows and

"A detailed examination of available water supply and
users for the Great Lakes basin reveals a number of
commonly encountered conflicts among competing
water uses, even under present climatic conditions.
First, it should be recognised that there are two
major and different hydrologic regions: the Great
Lakes proper and the tributary watersheds. Most of
the salient conflicting water uses for which the
regulation and stabilisation of the Great Lakes is
important is navigation and hydroelectric power
production, which favour high lake levels versus
recreation, reduction of flooding and _ shoreline
erosion which favours low lake levels. The former
(hydroelectric power and navigation) affects the
basis of an extensive industrial economy in the
region, while the latter affects millions of residents
who wish to recreate on the shores of the Great
Lakes and whose houses and property are affected
by storm damage. Since the lakes themselves are a
vast reservoir of water, the projected typical con-
sumptive uses of water (municipal and industrial
water supply, thermal cooling) are not expected to
impose a significant incremental adverse impact.
Tributary watersheds, on the other hand, experience
highly variable flows, with significant present con-
straints on in-stream and off-stream water uses.

Sahel, a vast though narrow, belt stretching from
West Africa to the Horn of Africa, is the transition
zone from the Saharan desert to the hot and
semi-arid African savannahs. Analysis of annual
precipitation data from stations in the Sahelian zone
for the period 1968-88 indicate that this period was
exceptionally dry. Although the current Sahelian

Three distinct methods were used to estimate the

analogs, spatial analogs, and hydrological models.
Because the GCM models all predict increases in
temperature of similar magnitude, and since global
temperatures have undergone a modest increase
over the past 100 years, temporal and spatial analogs
operate on the assumption that the magnitude of the
predicted global warming is correct. Although this
assumption may or may not be valid, these proced-
ures do provide one mechanism for understanding
basin response to anomalous climatic conditions.
Thus, periods of above average temperature in the
historical record may provide indications of the
potential impact of climatic change (temporal
analogs). Areas with past climatic conditions similar
to those expected in the future may also provide
such indications (spatial analogs). Hydrological
models can be used to determine the impacts of
changes in precipitation and other factors defined by

1000-year simulation (Table 4.6). Under assumed
warmings of 2°C and 4°C, the probability of drought
in the basin increases by 1.9 and 2.9 times respec-
tively. When the two warming scenarios are accom-
panicd by a 10% decrease in average precipitation,
the probability of drought increases to 4.8 and 6.4
times the probability under current conditions
respectively. A 10% increase in average precipita-
tion in conjunction with a 2°C warming actually
causes a decrease in the probability of drought. The

"Models of monthly streamflow (with and without
reservoirs) and daily streamflow (without reservoirs)
were developed to analyse the effects of climatic
change on basin runoff. Analyses of the sensitivity
of monthly streamflow to change in climate using a
monthly water-balance model without reservoirs, and
without changes in water use, indicate that warming
could result in an increase in the proportion of
winter precipitation that falls as rain in the northern
part of the basin (McCabe and Ayers, 1989). The
effect of such a change would be to reduce snow
accumulation, increase winter runoff, and reduce
spring and summer runoff. Basin-wide estimates of
total annual runoff indicate that warming of
2°C-4°C, without corresponding _ precipitation
increases, could produce a 9% to 25% decrease in
total annual runoff as a result of increased evapo-
transpiration. The simulations suggest that an
increase in precipitation of about 3% would be
needed to counteract decreases in runoff that would
result from each 1°C of warming. Annual runoff
changes estimated from the water-balance model
driven by climate change values generated using
three GCMs ranged from -39% to +9%.

watersheds in the Delaware River basin to climatic
change was evaluated, using this daily flow model.
The model stochastically generates time series of

series to detect trends in streamflow.

These simulations illustrate two important charac-
teristics about the sensitivity of basin watersheds to
climatic change. First, seasonal differences in the
expected effects of global warming on streamflow
are observed. Maximum daily streamflows increase
with time (more positive than negative trends) in
mid winter months, decrease in spring and summer,
and change little in fall and early winter. These
seasonal differences in trend primarily reflect chan-
ges in snowfall accumulation and snowmelt. With
warming, more winter precipitation falls as rain than
as snow, and snowmelt occurs earlier. The warming
effect is strongest in the northern part of the basin
where snow accumulation currently is significant.
Second, natural variability in precipitation masks the
effects of increasing temperature. The percentage of
simulations that do not show a significant increase
or decrease is greater than 58% in any month and
average 84%. Results of the simulations using the
daily watershed model (without reservoirs) indicate
that, overall, warming alone would cause a decrease
in daily streamflow, specifically the maximum and
average daily low and 7-day low flow. Most of this
decrease would occur in the warmer months. Where
snow accumulation currently is significant (in the
northern part of the basin), however, the warming
would result in an increase in the February average
and maximum daily flow, regardless of precipitation
changes. In gencral, watershed runoff was found to
be more sensitive to changes in daily precipitation
amounts than to changes in daily temperature or
precipitation duration. Detectability of runoff
changes was masked by the underlying variability in
precipitation.

"Hydroelectricity is a major source of power in
California, providing approximately 20% of the
state's total electricity production. In 1976, total
hydroelectric output dropped to just under 10%,
while in 1977 it dropped to 7%. The reduction in
relatively inexpensive hydroelectric energy produc-
tion occurred as the need for groundwater pumping
increased dramatically as a consequence of drasti-
cally reduced surface water deliveries. In 1977, 4.2
billion m’ more water than normal were pumped
from groundwater reservoirs (Gleick, 1988).

"California's climate is characterised by wet winters
and dry summers, with mean annual precipitation
decreasing from 190 cm in the northern Sacramento
River basin to 15 cm in the southern San Joaquin
River basin. The key feature of the hydrologic
characteristics of this basin is that a significant
proportion of the basin's precipitation falls as snow
in the high mountains. Consequently, storage of
water in the snowpack controls the seasonal timing
ofrunoff in the Central Valley rivers and has shaped
the evolution of strategies for water management
and flood protection (Smith and Tirpak, 1989).

"Gleick (1989) reported that the drought of 1976-77

management procedures and their effects on the

the severity of the drought, average annual precipita-
tion in California is approximately 250 billion m’. In
the 1976 water year, precipitation decreased to 160
billion m’, followed by even less precipitation in
1977, totalling 135 billion m’, or 45% of average.
Runoff in California's river dropped to 47% of
normal in 1976 and to 22% in 1977.

"California's rivers are highly regulated because its
water resources are poorly distributed relative to its
settlement patterns. Nearly 70% of the state's
surface water supply originates north of Sacramento,
while 70% of its population and 80% of the total
demand for water lies to the south. About 85% of
the Central Valley basin's total annual precipitation
occurs between November and April, whereas peak
water use occurs during the summer. About 826,000
ha are irrigated in the Sacramento River basin by
groundwater and surface water sources. An addi-
tional 794,000 ha are irrigated in the San Joaquin
River basin. Roughly 60% of the total population of
California (26 million) is served by surface water
sources, the remainder derived from groundwater.

"Gleick also sees evidence of increased runoff varia-
bility in the long term record of the Sacramento
River basin as expressed by the five-year moving
average of the standard deviation of the Sacramento
Basin unimpaired runoff record of 1906-86. This
relatively recent increase in variability (since the
1970s) has resulted in a series of changes in
standard planning and design assumptions about
peak flood volumes, drought severity, recurrence
intervals and reservoir operating rules. Thus, one of
the likely future climatic states of global warming
could be one in which there is a decrease in the
mean runoff and an increase in variability, ie an
increase in the frequency and magnitude of floods
and droughts.

"An assessment of the possible water resources
impacts of a doubling of atmospheric C 0, has been
made using the output from three GCMs. It should
be noted that conditions for the entire Central
Valley drainage system are encompassed within one
grid cell for each of the three GCMs. Again, there
is considerable diversity among the three models,
especially with regard to the seasonal prediction of
precipitation changes. Nevertheless, based on a
series of hydrologic impact studies conducted
through the US Environmental Protection Agency
and reported in Smith and Tirpak (1989), it was
shown that total annual runoff in the
Sacramento-San Joaquin River basin might be
expected to remain near current levels or to increase
somewhat under the scenarios simulated by each of
the GCMs. However, major changes could probably
occur in the seasonality of the runoff. In response
to higher temperatures, less precipitation would be
expected to fall as snow, and the snowpack that does
accumulate could melt earlier in the year. Thus,
there could be higher runoff in the winter months
and considerably less in the traditional spring snow-
melt-runoff season. Roos (1990) estimates that a
3°C temperature increase could shift about one-third
of the present spring snowmelt into increased winter
runoff. Also, the possibility exists for runoff varia-
bility to increase substantially during the winter
season.

model) to 15% (GISS model). This would occur be-
cause under current operating rules combined with
earlier (ie winter) snowmelt, the reservoir would not
have the capacity to store the early runoff for
summer season irrigation withdrawals while simulta-
neously retaining springtime flood control capabili-
ties.

"Climate change impacts on agriculture are compli-
cated by the fact that so much of it is dependent on
irrigation, which accounts for 80% of California's
water use. If there are substantial and persistent
shortages as a result of the inability of current water
management operating procedures to adapt to the
change in seasonality, these deficits would clearly
affect agricultural yields. However, two of the
GCMs, the GISS and GFDL models, were used to
predict changes in the yields of several different
crops (sugar beets, corn, cotton, and tomatoes)
under a doubling of CO, and the resultant potential
changes in mean annual and seasonal temperature,
precipitation and soil moisture. Under those direct
conditions of climatic change, all the crops were
simulated to suffer decreases in yield. When growth
enhancing effects of a doubled C0, atmosphere
were taken into account along with the primary
climatic effects, all the crops (except corn) showed
substantial increases in yield.

"where demand or pollution has led to water scarcity.
Little is known about regional details of greenhouse-
gas-induced hydrometeorological change. It appears
that many areas may have increased precipitation,
soil moisture and water storage, thus altering pat-
terns of agriculture, ecosystems and other water
uses. In other areas, however, water availability may
decrease, an important consideration for existing
marginal situations such as the Sahelian zone in
Africa. This has significant implications for agricul-
ture, water storage and distribution, and for hydro-
electric power generation. In some comparatively
small areas, assuming a 1°C-2°C temperature in-
crease coupled with a 10%-20% reduction in precipi-
tation, a 40%-70% decrease in annual or seasonal
runoff could occur. Regions such as Southeast Asia,
that are dependent on unregulated river systems, are
particularly vulnerable to hydrometeorological
change. On the other hand, regions such as the
western USSR and western US that have large
regulated water resource systems are less sensitive to
the range of hydrometeorological changes in the
assumed greenhouse scenario.

"The expected rise in global temperatures will affect
human health, comfort, life styles, food production,
economic activity, and residential and migration
patterns. As global temperature rises, atmospheric
circulation patterns are likely to change with alter-
ations in the frequency and seasonality of precipita-
tion and an overall increase in the rate of evapora-
tion and precipitation. Coupled with the associated
general rise in temperature, such changes in the
water cycle will affect water availability, agricultural

"This chapter covers a wide range of potential im-
pacts of climate change. It addresses the implica-
tions of global warming, sea-level rise, changed
precipitation and evaporation and _ stratospheric
ozone depletion for human settlement, which in-
cludes housing and infrastructure, and for the
energy, transport and industrial sectors. It also
covers the likely impacts of global warming and
stratospheric ozone depletion on human health and
air quality, and the potential overall impact on
human health and natural systems of increased levels
of ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation reaching the
earth's surface as a result of depletion of the strato-
spheric ozone layer.

"Model simulation and palaeoclimatic evidence
suggest that when climate warms, it warms more in
higher latitudes than in lower latitudes and more in
winter than in summer (Golitsyn, 1989; Schneider,
1989). A warmer atmosphere contains more water
vapour and increases the intensity of the whole
hydrological cycle, but precipitation patterns are
likely to change homogenously in time and space
(Golitsyn, 1989). Some scientists believe that in a
warmer climate the earth can be expected to experi-
ence more variable weather than now, with a likeli-
hood of more floods and drought, more intense
hurricanes or typhoons, and more _heatwaves
(Golitsyn, 1989; Hansen et al., 1989).

"increase in concentrations of greenhouse gases
(GHG) in the atmosphere will cause a significant
increase in global average annual temperatures. An
increase in GHG concentrations equivalent in
infrared absorbing effect to a doubling of pre-
industrial levels of C0, is projected to occur be-
tween 2025 and 2050. This increase in concentra-
tions of GHG could be expected at equilibrium,
according to projections of Working Group I, to
produce a rise in average annual global temperature
of 2°-4°C. Although most climate impact scenarios
have used effective C0, doubling, should current
emissions growth continue GHG concentrations
would be expected to rise past an effective CO,
doubling.

"Evaluating scientific predictions of global climate
change is the responsibility of Working Group I. At
present there are substantial scientific uncertainties
about the nature and magnitude of climatic changes
that might result from an effective doubling of CO,
concentrations in the atmosphere. However, it is
necessary to make some assumptions about changes
in climate in order to assess potential impacts which
are due to these changes. The general types of
changes that serve as a basis for the impacts assess-
ments are described below. They are not intended to
be definitive. The assessments in each section of
this report summarise studies in the literature that
are based on varying assumptions about climate
change; those assumptions are generally described
for each study cited. Many impact assessments are
based on projections of a particular General Circu-
lation Model (GCM) for long-term equilibrium
conditions due to an equivalent C0, doubling in
radiative forcing, while others assume a particular
change in temperature, precipitation, or other
variables. Owing to the large heat capacity of the
oceans, full realisation of equilibrium temperature
increase associated with a radiative forcing is expect-
ed to be delayed a number of years.

was the warmest year of the past century in average
global temperature (British Meteorological Office
and University of East Anglia, 1989). The same
researchers reported that 1989 was the fifth warmest
year in the 134 years for which they have compiled
global temperature records and that six of the ten
warmest years on record were in the 1980s (Kerr,

coastal defences, a sea-level rise of 1 m could
inundate the port area of 1900 km’* and cause
damage to nine million Japanese (Ministry of
Transport of Japan, 1989). With industry in sub-
Saharan Africa concentrated heavily in seaports,
many of which are capitals (Tebicke, personal
communication, 1989), even a modest sea-level rise
could pose a major threat to the economy and
political infrastructure of Africa. Chapter 6

more detail.

"house effect-induced global warming, tectonic factors
and groundwater withdrawal have contributed to
rapid rises in recent years in the sea-level along
many parts of China's coasts. Although sea-level
along the Chinese coast has generally risen 11.5 cm
in the past 100 years, relative sea-level rise has been
much faster in some low-lying coastal plains. Sea-
level rose 0.75 m from 1954-1978 in the Pearl River
deltaic plain and 13 m in the North China coastal
plain around Tianjin; in recent years land settlement
caused merely by groundwater withdrawal has
exceeded 2 m in the downtown areas of Tianjin and
Shanghai (Han, 1989).

"Although climatologists disagree on whether the
observed increase over the past century of about
0.6°C in average annual global surface temperature
is a clear 'signal' of greenhouse warming, or still
within the natural variability of climate, there seems
little dispute among climatologists that humanity has
already significantly reshaped the earth's climate
through such factors as the urban heat-island effect,
intensification of desertification through land degra-
dation, deforestation and stratospheric ozone deple-
tion. These factors, some of which have arisen quite
independently of the build-up in global concen-
trations of GHG, are likely to produce significant
effects on humanity, often magnifying the disruption
caused by a rapid greenhouse-induced global warm-
ing.
"	Text
"Together with the anticipated disruption in atmos-
pheric circulation and storm patterns, humanity is
expected to face a significant rise in global mean
sea-level. Global warming will cause a thermal
expansion of the upper layers of the ocean and this
expansion, together with the expected melting and
movement into the ocean of some land-based
glaciers, is expected to accelerate the current sea-
level rise trend. A rise of 9-29 cm is expected over
the next 40 years, or 28-98 cm by 2090 (Working
Group I Report - Summary). A rise of only 25 cm
or more in relative sea-level would displace many
residents of the delta regions of the Nile, the Ganges
and the Yangtze from their homes and livelihoods
and could render uninhabitable island nations such

much more severe weather-related events such as
droughts, floods and extremely severe tropical
cyclones. One estimate is that an effective C0,
doubling may increase the intensity of tropical
cyclones or hurricanes as much as 40% (Emanuel,

intensity of such storms, humanity can expect an
expansion of the area vulnerable to tropical cyclones,
with the areas of potential damage expanding
northward in the Northern Hemisphere and south-
ward in the Southern Hemisphere, perhaps exposing
such populated areas as the eastern coasts of
Australia (Henderson-Sellers and Blong, 1989).
These projections of greater problems from tropical
cyclones are based largely on calculations of effects
of increased surface temperature. Although the area
of sea having temperatures over this critical value
will increase as the globe warms, the critical tem-
perature itself may increase in a warmer world

provide a much more definitive picture of likely

particularly noteworthy example is the automotive
industry. A rise of 3°C or 4°C in mean global
temperatures would require only little adaptation in
engine design given the wide tolerances already
engineered into cars; yet public concern about GHG
emissions may lead to more stringent fuel economy

and public policies or consumer shifts favouring
alternative fuels in place of gasoline, and shifts from

on the structure of energy investment. Response
strategies to greenhouse effect concerns may cause
some countries to choose more reliance on nuclear

among types of fossil fuels. Non-climate-related
environmental factors may also act as constraints on
rapidly increased reliance on non-carbon energy
systems such as hydroelectric power or nuclear
power. Increased construction of hydroelectric
projects may require considerable human resettle-

A serious constraint on increased reliance on

© If water supply to a thermal power plant is re-
duced, the dissipation of waste heat may require
use of more costly water or a change in the
technology to dissipate the heat (Smith and
Tirpak, 1989; Nishinomiya et al., 1989).

If greater variation in extreme weather events
occurs, transmission and distribution systems sus-
ceptible to interruption due to storms may need
to be ‘hardened’ at increased cost or customers
may have to accept less reliable service. (Smith
and Tirpak, 1989; Nishinomiya et al., 1989).

Sea-level rise can require added expenditures at
present coastal power plant sites for new or added
barriers from rising waters and may reduce
acceptable sites for future thermal power plants
(Smith and Tirpak, 1989; Nishinomiya et al.,
1989),

Increases in regional cloudiness or decreases in
prevailing wind intensity can reduce the supply or
increase the cost of renewable energy sources that
directly convert solar energy or wind to electricity
or heating (Smith and Tirpak, 1989; Nishinomiya

responses to global warming have not been con-

emissions, it is likely that any response policy will
greatly constrain or increase the price of fuels and
electricity produced for fossil fuels. Response

"Studies of impacts on energy supply and demand are
presently limited in terms of types of potential
impacts studied, regions studied and consideration of
the range of potential impact under the uncertain
and highly variable results ofregional climate change
provided by GCMs. The rates of change and
patterns of change for regions over several decades
need to be more properly represented in the impacts
assessment. Since new energy sources and technolo-
gies are evolving, detailed studies of their capabilities
and vulnerability to climate change are needed. In
the case of hydroelectric power, possible changes in
runoff and demands for water vary greatly with local
conditions. Hence, detailed study of each basin will
be required to identify the range of possible climate
change impacts.

rates of change are likely to result in substantial
differences in costs to take mitigative actions, de-
pending on whether normal planning and replace-
ment of facilities can occur or whether the lifetime
of existing energy units is reduced. Some locales
may experience increased supply of water from
climate change without offsetting evaporation; this
can reduce costs in differences among technology
choices because of availability of water or, in other
locales, it can increase costs at existing facilities

"* Climate change may lead to redistribution of
populations, resulting in increased investment to
supply the needed shifts in energy supply and

* Biomass energy (eg fuelwood for cooking) repre-
sents a large fraction of total energy use in some
developing countries: more than 80% in most
and 90% in some African countries (Tebicke,
Remarks, 1989). If biomass production potential
is constrained by climate change induced reduc-
tion in soil moisture or inundation of arable land,
then it will be difficult for nations so affected to
replace the energy in view of the capital costs of
alternative sources. Biomass for energy may also
remove valuable forest cover and it competes with
alternative uses of the biomass (eg for building
material) or of the land for food production.
Biomass currently is used for energy with very low
efficiency except for new advanced technologies,
such as new cooking-stove designs.

This motor vehicle component was, Jessup points
out, the largest single component of Canada's

facturing sector may be requirements to increase the
efficiency of manufacturing processes to reduce
energy consumption and GHG emissions. Among
those industries that may be especially affected by
response strategies is the Portland cement industry,
which generates, according to one estimate, about
1181 million tons of global C 0, emissions each year
(Margolin, 1990). At this time, there is little analysis
to project these potential impacts of response

"While it is difficult to estimate numerical effect on
the basis of epidemiologic data in the US (USEPA,

that for every 1% decrease in stratospheric ozone,
there will be between a 0.3% to 0.6% increase in
cataracts. Based on the same epidemiologic date, it
was also estimated that for every 1% depletion of
ozone the incidence of basal cell carcinoma, squa-
mous cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma, will
increase 2.7%, 4.6% and 0.6%, respectively. There
is concern that UV-B radiation, suppression of the
immune system might lead to an increase of the
incidence and severity of infectious diseases. It is
necessary to confirm the incidence rate of skin
cancer in various countries in relation to U V - B dose.
Data on U V -B exposure dose is extremely limited.

(6.0). (Figure in parenthesis is factor of multiplica-

consumption is decreased by 0.9% in winter and
increased by 2.7% in summer with IK rise of air

regression analysis, Wratt predicted that at
Christchurch, New Zealand, with minimum tempera-

decrease by 14% and 19%, respectively.

A temperature rise of 2K would raise water vapour

"Smog chamber studies conducted by Carter et al.
(1979) and by Hatakeyama et al. (1989) found
increases in peak ozone concentration with the rise
of temperature from experimental temperature of
280K to 320K and of 303K to 323K, respectively.
The chamber experiments supported a view that the
time of exposure to high levels of ozone would be
increased in the region of higher temperature. In
smog chamber experiments Johnson (1983) found
that photochemical smog increases with temperature,
provided that photochemical smog production is in
the so-called 'light-limited' phase and not the 'NO,

"While some different results were obtained, a
majority of the studies indicate the potential for
increased ozone production with increasing tempera-
ture in industrialised urban areas. Since higher
temperature increase is predicted at higher latitudes,
much attention should be paid to the increased
ozone production in such areas. In developing
countries, ozone pollution may be limited to the
largest cities, but the extent of the problem may
expand, given the explosive growth of urban area in
those parts of the world. It is well accepted that
increased levels of local and regional air pollution,
particularly photochemical air pollution, may exert
effects upon human health and terrestrial plants. In
addition, acid rain could affect sensitive areas in

"Temperature-dependent modelling studies on ozone
production were conducted by Gery et al. (1987),
Morris etal. (USEPA, 1988), and MacCracken and
Santer (1975). According to the studies by Gery et
al. (1987) the increase in ozone is predicted to be
about 14 + 0.5% per IK increase. The production
of H,0, is predicted to increase at a much higher
rate. The model calculation also predicted increased
ozone production with the depletion of stratospheric
ozone. In the San Francisco Bay area Morris
concluded that 4K of temperature increase resulted
in a 20% increase in peak ozone concentration and
about a doubling of the area in exceedence of the
national ambient air quality standards (120 ppb).
On the other hand, MacCracken and Santer indicat-
ed that for the San Francisco Bay area the LIRAQ
model showed 2% decrease in peak ozone with a
nominal temperature increase from 285K to 304K.
Wratt (1989) predicted that in Auckland tempera-
ture increases of 1.5K and 3.5K would increase peak
ozone concentration by 8% and 19%, respectively.
A recent modelling analysis conducted by the US
EPA showed that for a maximum average tempera-
ture rise of 2.5K, the increase in peak ozone would
be between 2% and 10% for various urban locations
throughout the US.

"IPCC Working Group I scenarios were developed in
parallel with the preparation of this report and are
generally consistent with the assumptions of this

respect to sea-level rise have considered higher rates
than those projected by Working Group I. This is
useful information, given that there are important
regional differences expected in sea-level rise be-
cause of such things as regional land subsidence,
glacial rebound and oceanic currents (Mikolajewice
et al., 1990), and the possibility of continuing natural
processes such as polar ice sheet response to the last
glaciation (NASA, 1990).

"Present population growth and development in areas

reason for concern. The foreseeable consequences
of global warming and sea-level rise heighten con-
cerns for countries and their citizens occupying these
vulnerable areas. Other aspects of a countrys
economic and social well-being may be adversely
affected by fundamental changes to its fisheries and
agriculture or its economic base in tourism. Also, in
some countries, beaches and other coastal features
provide important cultural values which may be
threatened by sea-level rise. Further, there may be
impacts on biodiversity as some small localised
habitats are lost or move faster than the plants or
animals which depend on them can adjust.

"Estimating monetary impacts is fairly straightfor-

non-monetary impacts (morbidity or mortality,
ecosystem damage). Jansen (1990) reviewed meth-
ods of quantifying each. He discussed preventative
policy measures, which are global and long term,
and adaptive measures that can be more easily
implemented nationally or locally. The few studies
on economic assessment of sea-level rise estimate
the engineering cost only.
"	Text
"Another problem facing all impact analyses is the
need for baseline scenarios - in this case, what
would happen without global warming (Stakhiv and
Hanchey, 1989). Unfortunately, most sea-level rise
studies (a notable exception is Gibbs, 1984), have
ignored this issue and have generally assumed the
current level of coastal development (eg Park et al.,
1989; Delft, 1990a). The failure to consider future
coastal development may have led these studies to
underestimate the socioeconomic and environmental
impacts of rising sea-level. Finally, there is little
consistency regarding the probable response of
society.

"The direct effect of inundation is the potentially
large loss of inhabited areas, particularly in low-
lying, flat deltaic and estuarine areas. Half of
humanity inhabits the coastal regions around the
globe, and large areas of highly vulnerable flood-
prone sections are densely populated. A i m rise in
sea-level could inundate 12-15% of Egypt's arable
land (Broadus et.al., 1986) and 17% of Bangladesh
(Commonwealth Secretariat, 1989). Large displace-
ments of population would be likely in Indonesia
and Vietnam. The United States would lose 20,000
km’ kilometres of land, an area worth about $650
billion (Park et al., 1989; Yohe, 1990).

"Coastal areas, particularly low-lying areas exposed to
the open ocean are inherently hazardous, yet they
have attracted people, industry and commerce.
Every year lives are lost, tens of billions of dollars of
damages are sustained, and hundreds of square
kilometres of land are eroded. For most inhabitants
who have a choice, the perceived benefits of living in
this highly variable zone outweigh the risks and
costs. Many are not so fortunate - they do not have
the choices available to them. Thus, much of the
dense coastal infrastructure in place today will
probably be protected to the extent technically and
economically feasible. Retreat would be more likely
in less developed areas (Moser and Stakhiv, 1989;
Dean et al., 1987; Barth and Titus, 1984).

"A simple measure of a country's vulnerability to sea-
level rise is the proportion of its population and
productive land that is within a few metres of
present mean sea-level. A direct relationship exists
between inundation (extended by the impacts of
climate variability, storm surges, waves and erosion)
and the viability of inhabited areas. Health, safety
and food security are among the primary deter-
minants of socioeconomic well-being. Threats to
these attributes of well-being define a region's
vulnerability. Not all countries are equally vulnera-
ble and many will be only indirectly affected by sea-
level rise, with limited impacts to a particular sector
of the economy (eg fisheries, tourism) or affecting
the mechanisms of trade and transportation (eg
waterways, ports, inlets).

"inhabitants per km’ would be protected, protection
costs may be overstated. On the other hand, the
total cost of sea-level rise may be underestimated
because coastal areas are still being developed and
the study did not consider the value of lost wetlands,
dry land that would not be protected, or the cost of
correcting problems due to increased flooding or
saltwater intrusion.

"Differing interests may cause conflict and dispute
over property rights and responsibilities. Farmers
losing land to sea-level rise can get land only from
others to compensate for their loss. Since vacant
agricultural land is scarce, the result could be ruin
for farmers hit by the effects of land loss. The
problems can be tremendous in countries where
large populations and areas are seriously hit.

"The 1190 small islands making up the Republic of
the Maldives barely rise 2-4 m above sea-level

A recent UNEP report on the republic (Pernetta

countries. The Maldives already experience serious
environmental degradation, primarily because of the
high population density on the few inhabited islands
within each atoll.

"In many areas, the total shoreline retreat from rising
sea-level would be greater than that due to inunda-
tion alone, because land well above sea-level could
also erode. In the US, several studies have conclud-
ed that a 30 cm rise would eliminate the existing
recreational beaches at most major resorts and
threaten ocean-front property worth tens of millions
of (US) dollars per kilometre of shoreline (Kana et
al., 1984; Leatherman, 1985; Titus, 1986; 1990). The
Miami and Perth IPCC coastal workshops suggested
that sea-level rise would also threaten oceanside
development in Portugal, Brazil, Nigeria, Thailand
and most other nations with tourist beaches.

"In a recent survey, Delft Hydraulics Laboratory
(1990a, 1990b) attempted a first-order estimate of
181 coastal countries and territories. The study
estimated that 345,335 km of low coast, 6400 km of
urban waterfronts, 10,725 km of sandy beaches, and
1756 km’ of harbour areas would have to be protect-
ed. Many of the island countries do not have the
alternative of retreat and must either protect them-
selves or evacuate the islands. Table 6.1 shows the
annual costs of preventing inundation and erosion as
a percentage of the country's GNP. For ten count-
ries, nine of which are islands, the estimate of
annual costs would comprise greater than 5% of
their GNP. Because the study assumed that all low

"Sea-level rise could decrease the agricultural pro-
ductivity of many deltaic countries that can least
afford the losses (Bangladesh, Egypt, China etc).
The impacts on agriculture arise not only from
direct loss of arable land to inundation, but also to
the increased potential for erosion and increased
coastal and riverine flooding. For example, about
20% ofagricultural production could be lost, mainly
rice, sugarcane and jute, as a result of the 1 m
inundation of Bangladesh (UNEP, 1989). Similarly,
about 15% of Egypt's agricultural production would
be permanently lost. Thailand and China are
regarded as being especially vulnerable to significant
losses of productive deltaic agricultural land, as are
Gambia, Senegal, Nigeria and Mozambique. Addi-
tional land could also be degraded by salinisation
and flooding.

"Many small island countries would lose a significant
part of their land area with a sea-level rise of 1 m
(Lewis, 1988). Coral atoll nations, such as Kiribati,
Marshall Islands, Tokelau and Tuvalu, Cocos and
Keeling Islands, are particularly vulnerable to
inundation and erosion because they are generally
below 3 m elevation and narrow, implying few
possibilities for retreat. Coral reefs along many
tropical coasts serve as natural breakwaters. Any
sea-level rise will allow waves to over-top the reefs,
increasing coastal vulnerability to erosion and
storms, at least until reef growth can catch up with
sea-level. The more rapid the rate of sea-level rise,
the longer the period of vulnerability, and the
greater the possibility that present reefs will be
unable to catch up and that they will drown. Coral
mining for building materials, and land reclamation
on coral reef flats increase the risk of damage.

"Other possible associated effects of global warming
could also increase coastal flooding. In particular,
increases in the frequency and magnitude of riverine
floods and coastal storms could result from changing
weather patterns, increased precipitation, and

and other precipitation - runoff phenomena. The
resultant wetter soils and increased flows could
exacerbate flooding and result in the loss of

"The higher base for storm surges would be particu-
larly important in areas where hurricanes or severe
storms are frequent, such as the southeastern US,
the Indian subcontinent, the western Pacific and
islands in the Caribbean Sea. Wynne (1989) esti-
mates that even a 50 cm rise would cause areas in
South Australia, flooded today only once per centu-
ry, to be flooded every two years. In Japan, aim
rise would threaten an area of 1700 km’ square
kilometres in which 4 million people live (Mansfield
and Nishioka, 1989).

"Sea-level rise would generally enable salt water to
advance inland in both aquifers and _ estuaries.
Particularly during droughts, the upstream migration
of salt fronts in estuaries would threaten municipal
and industrial freshwater intakes that draw water
from tidal rivers for water supply. In the US, a 50
cm rise would enable salt water to advance 10-20 km
upstream in the Delaware Estuary, threatening
Philadelphia's municipal intake, as well as adjacent
aquifers that are recharged by the (currently fresh)
river water (Hull and Titus, 1986); New York
(Miller et al., 1988), Southern California (Williams,
1989) and coastal cities throughout the world relying
on freshwater intakes that draw water from tidal
rivers would be similarly vulnerable.

"Saltwater contamination of municipal water supplies
could also occur more frequently than under
historical drought periods. Even in areas where the
General Circulation Models (GCM) predict a net
increase of mean annual precipitation, the models
also suggest a progressive increase in the frequency
of droughts to the year 2050. Not only could
municipal water supplies be contaminated more
frequently, at the most critical times, groundwater
aquifers could also be contaminated by saltwater
intrusion. In addition, a good deal of agricultural
irrigation water is withdrawn from the streams and
rivers. Hence these supplies would also be adversely
affected by extended periods of saltwater intrusion,
also during the critical drought periods.

"Floods in Bangladesh would be worse for all of
these reasons. In 1987, for example, flood crests of
the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers coincided in
Bangladesh, inundating about one third of the
country and forcing tens of millions of people from
their homes. In addition, about ten million people
live on land that lies within 1 m of mean sea-level
near the coast. The coastal plains of Guyana, which
also he at the high-tide level, are inhabited by 90%
of the population. The coastal defence system has
deteriorated and is vulnerable to sea-level rise.
Finally, the Pacific and Indian Ocean atoll countries
would be especially threatened by the increased
flooding from a combination of sea-level rise and the
possibility of the increased frequency and magnitude
of coastal storms and cyclones (Emmanuel, 1988).
"	Text
"rises, these damages could increase substantially as
the most densely populated areas landward of the
present shoreline come under the direct influence of
storm surges and wave attack. Sea-level could
increase the risk of flooding for three reasons: (i)
there would be a higher base upon which storm
surges would build; if sea-level rises 1 m, an area
flooded today with 50 cm of water every 20 years
would then be flooded with 150 cm every 20 years;
surges would penetrate further inland (Kana et al.,
1984). (ii) beaches, sand dunes, coral reefs, marshes
and mangroves currently protect many areas from
direct wave attack; by removing these protective
barriers, erosion would leave many areas more
vulnerable; and (iii) sea-level rise would increase
flooding from rainstorms and river surges owing to
decreased drainage (Titus et al., 1987).
"	Text
"A particular concern facing atoll countries is the
impact of sea-level rise on groundwater availability.
Countries such as Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Tokelau
and Tuvalu in the Pacific, and the Maldives, Cocos
and Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean depend on
rainwater lenses that lie atop salt water. As sea-
level rises, the thickness of the freshwater lens
decreases, and hence the volume of fresh water
decreases (Figure 6.3). Also sea-level rise would
increase the likelihood of storm overwash of the
islands, causing increased incidence of saltwater
contamination of the freshwater lenses. Studies have
also shown that as the atoll islands erode owing to
increased sea-level rise and wave attack, a 20%
reduction in the width ofan island may cause a 50%
loss of the volume of fresh water (Commonwealth
Secretariat, 1989). Clearly, basic subsistence on
these islands would be seriously impaired. If these
changes are coupled with more frequently occurring
droughts, the socioeconomic and ecological impacts
could be devastating to these island countries.

wetlands can keep pace with a slow rate of sea-level

the area of intertidal wetlands to increase several-

thousand years. However, if sea-level rises at a rate
greater than the ability of wetlands to keep pace, the
area of wetlands could decline by a similar amount;
and when bulkheads and dikes protect adjacent dry
land, there could be a complete loss (Titus et al.,

"Rising sea-level would expose coastal infrastructure
to the combined impacts of waves, storm surges and

Modifications to stormwater and sewerage systems,
ports and navigation channels, roads, bridges and
water supply infrastructure could substantially
increase this figure (Titus and Greene, 1989).
Drainage improvements necessitated by a | m rise
in sea-level for Miami International Airport alone,
would cost about $US30 million (Miller, 1988). In
Japan, the cost of modifying infrastructure for a 1 m

existing wetlands, although the net loss would be

case of a 140 cm rise, they estimated that 90% of
existing wetlands would be lost, but the net loss
would be only 80% if the adjacent dryland areas are
abandoned. In contrast, in the Long Beach Island
site they found that a 90 cm rise would have little
impact on total wetland acreage; the primary impact
would be to convert the predominant high marsh to
low marsh; a 140 cm rise, however, would drown
80% of the wetlands.

"Park et al. (1986) used topographic maps to attain a
first approximation of the impact of sea-level rise on
US coastal wetlands. Their results suggested that a
14 m and 2.1 m rise in sea-level would inundate
47% and 80% (respectively) of US wetlands, but
these losses could be reduced to 31% and 70%
(respectively) if adjacent developed lowland were
abandoned to the advancing sea.' However, Titus
(1988) noted that interpolation of topographic maps
inherently overestimates wetland elevations, and
hence underestimates wetland loss. Therefore, Park
et al. (1989) revised their regional study, this time
using an unbiased procedure for estimating wetland
elevations and using the lower estimate ofa 1 m rise
in sea-level. The revised results implied that such a
rise would inundate 50-82% (95% confidence inter-
val) of existing wetlands, but that the net loss would
be reduced to 29-66% if only densely developed
areas are protected.

flooding, coupled with reduced interior drainage,
could cause more frequent stormwater overloading
of the municipal drainage and sewerage systems.
The addition of large pulses of point source and
non-point source pollution would contribute to
general water quality degradation of riverine, estua-

potentially serious effects of the leaching of toxic
and hazardous contaminants from countless hazard-
ous waste sites, at least those in the US, that are
located within the 100-year floodplain. Septic
systems would fail and overflow more frequently as
the soils remain waterlogged for extended periods.
Moreover, if drainfields from septic tanks are less
than 1.5 m above the watertable, they contaminate
it; higher watertables would make this situation
more commonplace. Finally, water bodies could
stagnate, both because of higher temperatures and
the decreased mixing and tidal flushing associated
with deeper water (Park, 1990).

"Wetlands are vital to the ecology and economy of
coastal areas. Their biological productivity is equal
to or exceeds that of any other natural or
agricultural system, (Teal, 1962; Ryzkowski, 1984).
Wetlands support resident and migratory birds,
coastal animals which use them for habitats and
forage, and they are vital to the well-being of many
species of fish and shellfish. Over half the species of
commercially important fish in the southeastern US
use salt marshes as nursery grounds. The value of
marshes as habitat for various life-cycle stages of
countless species may be their most important
function. Wetlands also serve as sinks for pollutants
and provide a degree of protection from floods,
storms and high tides. Based on these functions,
marshes have an estimated present worth to society
of as much as $US13,600/ha (Thurman, 1983).

"Coastal wetlands and estuaries are important to
many species. If sea-level rise is too rapid, natural
succession of the coastal ecology would not take
place and could lead to disruption in the life cycles
of many species. In the near term, production of
fisheries could rise as marshes flood, die and decom-
pose, thus improving fisheries habitat in some cases
and providing more nutrients. Additional nutrients
would become available from leaching of soils and
peat which would flood more frequently. This
temporary increase in productivity appears to be
happening now in the southeastern US where sea-
level rise is compounded by land subsidence
(Zimmerman et al., 1989). However, this temporary
benefit for fisheries may be balanced by negative
impacts on birds and other wildlife as the habitat
area is decreased. In the longer term, by 2050 the
overall impact on fisheries and wildlife will probably
be negative.

"A recent global survey of coastal wetlands and
mangrove swamps was conducted by the Netherlands
(Rijkswaterstaat, 1990). This survey, which did not
include data from the US, Canada, Australia and
New Zealand, shows that, in the aggregate, there are
about 730,000 km’ of coastal wetlands, plus another
165,000 km* of mangroves. Eight countries out of
120 surveyed - Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Cuba,
Indonesia, Papua-New Guinea, Vietnam and
Malaysia - possess slightly more than half of the
world's coastal wetlands. They found through their
survey that about 88% of the total coastal wetlands
areas of the world are situated in regions with a
population density of less than 10 inhabitants/km’*.
They reason that these areas are unlikely to be
protected by ‘hard' coastal structures because of
unfavourable economics, and thus, the land uses
upland of the wetlands pose no barriers to the
landward migration and transition of wetland types
as sea-level rises. At most, 5-10% of wetlands by
area would be lost to hard coastal structures with a
rise of 1 m given the current level of coastal devel-
opment. This conclusion is similar to that of Park et
al. (1989). Thus, most wetland loss would be due to
inundation, not coastal structures. Nevertheless,
several authors have cautioned that current rates of
coastal development could lead to much greater
proportion of the coast being developed, with a
corresponding increase in wetland loss due to
structures preventing the inland migration of coastal
ecosystems (Everett and Pastula, 1990; Titus, 1990).

"The primary direct physical effect of sea-level rise is
inundation. Inundation increases the rate of shore-
line recession or retreat by raising the mean water
level upon which the tides, waves and storm surges
can attack the beaches, bluffs, embayments and
barrier islands of the world's coastlines. Historically,
submergence has accounted for a relatively small
portion of net shoreline recession along exposed
sedimentary coasts (Hands, 1976). That is, most
sandy shorelines worldwide have retreated during
the past century because of the erosion associated
with the regional storm and wave climate (Bird,
1976). Locally, human interference with the coastal
sediment transport regime has accelerated erosion
problems, as jetties and groins have impeded littoral
transport processes. On a global scale, however,
human interference cannot be considered a primary
cause of erosion since retreat also occurs on sparsely

gJpopulated and little-developed sandy coasts (Bird,
1976). Less than 10% of the length of the world's
sandy shoreline has progressed, more than 60% has
regressed, and the balance (30%) has been relatively
stable or has shown no consistent trend during the
past century (Bird, 1976).

impeded by protective structures. The value of these
wetlands as habitat for wildlife could be impaired
during the transitional period and their biodiversity
may decrease (Davis, 1985). Sedimentation and peat
formation have allowed many wetlands to keep pace
with sea-level rise in the last few thousand years,
which has enabled the area of wetlands to increase
in most parts of the world, as illustrated in Figure
6.3. However, ifthe sea-level rises more rapidly than
the wetland vertical accretion rate, there could be a
corresponding net loss of wetlands. Kearney and
Stevenson (1985) found that in some areas, any
acceleration of sea-level rise would induce a net loss
of wetlands; in contrast, Park et al. (1986, 1989)
assumed that wetland accretion in most areas could
keep pace with an acceleration of 1 or 2 mm per
year. The literature provides no evidence, however,
that wetlands could generally keep pace with a
relative sea-level rise of 1 cm per year, which would
be reached by the year 2100 even in the 50 cm
scenario. In fact, such a rate would be as great as
the rate attained during the disintegration of the
continental ice sheets at the end of the Pleistocene,
which drowned barrier islands and associated fea-
tures on the continental shelves (Peltier, 1988).

es associated with these beaches. There is still
considerable debate in the literature regarding the
origin and fate of barrier beaches under conditions
of sea-level rise. The general consensus is that in
response to sea-level rise, barrier islands tend to
migrate landward as storms wash sand from the
ocean side to the bay side. This overwash process
may enable barrier islands to keep pace with an
accelerated sea-level rise (Leatherman, 1982).
However, there is also a belief that these barrier
islands will either disintegrate or will merge with the
mainland, if the rate of sea-level rise is rapid.

are: sea surface temperature, average surface wind
speed, solar radiation flux, total cloudiness, sea-level
pressure and evaporation. In each model, the ocean
is considered as a simple mixed layer; ice cover and
its melting are also included. However, none of the
published coupled ocean-atmosphere GCMs has a
satisfactory treatment of sea ice or deep ocean
circulation. A chronic problem in these models has
been a too large ice extent and too weak thermo7~

its connection to the Arctic Ocean (Bryan, 1986;

"Apart from the impact on the water circulation in
the World Ocean, a warming in arctic and antarctic
regions may have a significant influence on the state
of the earth's cryosphere (glaciers and shelf and sea
ice). Such changes will in turn further affect the
global climate. First, sea ice, covering 11% of the
world's ocean surface, affects internal ocean and
ocean-atmosphere thermal exchange. These factors
determine the intensity of convection in the ocean
which characterises the mean time scale of processes
occurring in deep ocean layers (for example, C0,
uptake). Therefore, changes in the extent of sea ice
will have an effect on atmospheric circulation and
temperature. Also, open ocean waters absorb much
more solar radiation than do those which are ice
covered (Walsh, 1983). Second, even small changes
in the earth's cryosphere could lead to a noticeable
deviation of global sea-level from its recent average
value. The predicted warming for the Arctic will
lead to significant reduction in sea-ice extent around
Svalbard, and along the north Siberian and Canadian
arctic coasts. At the same time the projected rise in
temperature for the period up to the middle of the
21st century is not expected to lead to a significant
decrease in the amount of ice volume in the massive
ice caps of Greenland and Antarctica. In fact, a
recent study in the Northern Hemisphere has shown
that despite a small increase in mean annual tem-
perature, the extent of ice has increased in the most
recent decade (Bryan et al., 1988). The predicted
rise of temperature by 4°-5°C by the middle of the
21st century (Mitchell, 1988) might lead to accelera-
tion of the ice flow from the continent into the
ocean in west Antarctica and lead to decrease in ice
cover in the Arctic (Budyko and Izrael, 1987).
Owing to melting sea ice in the Arctic, freshening of

the ocean alkalinity which determines the solubility

"Measurements of gases trapped in polar ice cores
(Barnola et al., 1987) convincingly demonstrated that
the concentration of atmospheric C 0, was subject to
several dramatic natural changes which paralleled
and possibly slightly preceded the major climatic
fluctuations. Since the ocean contains about 60
atmospheric carbon units (Sundquist and Broecker,
1985) such changes, to a great extent, must be tied
to the ocean. The ‘biological pump' transfers C0,
across the thermocline into deep water via photosyn-
thetic marine organisms which incorporate gaseous
CO. into carbonaceous compounds. The combined
variations in the 'biological pump' process and in the
chemistry and physical circulations of the ocean,
could provide the dominant forcing of the observed
changes in atmospheric C0, (Siegenthaler and

"Sea-level rise, followed by flooding and erosion of
soil, could lead to substantial increases in the flow of
nitrogen, phosphorous and sulphur into the coastal
zones, creating the potential for severe eutrophica-

biochemical cycling ofall biogenic elements (Oppen—

cause a rise in the productivity of adjacent nutrient-
poor ecosystems, particularly the so-called ‘oceanic
deserts'. However, whether or not nutrient supplies
and productivity would actually increase as a result
of increased wetland and sediment erosion from sea-
level rise appears to be dependent on regional
conditions. For example, in the Beaufort Sea,
eroding peat from the tundra may be an important
source of organic carbon for the coastal food chain,
but in warmer water, such as the gulf of Mexico,
where the biodegration and nutrient recycling rates
are higher, the eroding nutrient and organics may
not provide a significant contribution to the overall
flux of materials. Rather, the relationship of
increased fishery yield with wetland degradation in
warmer waters may be more plausibly related to
increased wetland-saltwater interface, affecting
habitat dimensions (Condrey, 1989). This phenom-
enon has been observed, at least for the short term,
in the Gulf of Mexico (Zimmerman et al., 1989).

"America is accompanied by a rise of sea surface
temperature of 5°-8°C, strengthening of water mass
stratification and, consequently, by a sharp weaken-
ing of the intensity of coastal upwelling. These
processes lead to mass development of the organ-
isms of 'red tides' (dinoflagellates and symbiotic
bacteria), changes in the series structure of the
phytoplanktonic community, a sharp reduction of
productivity in the coastal zone, mass mortality of
fish and birds feeding on them, as well as to secon-
dary contamination of the ecosystem with organic
matter. Economic damage for the region is estimat-
ed at hundreds of millions of dollars.

"In the Pacific Ocean the El Nino phenomenon is the
dominant interannual climate signal. Thus, it has
immense consequences in the Pacific and also in
other parts of the world. Consequently it is import-
ant to know what will happen to this dominant
short-term phenomenon under the postulated
conditions of long-term global warming. El Nino is
an oscillatory ocean-atmosphere interaction process,
which exhibits maxima recurring at intervals of 2-10
years with extremes occurring at about 30 years. It
is caused by disturbances in the global atmospheric

"Recent investigations of palaeo-productivity of the
World Ocean, based on organic carbon accumulation
rates (Sarnthein et al., 1987) have shown that the
basic spatial distribution patterns of ocean produc-
tivity persisted through glacial and interglacial times.
However, the ocean in glacial times was character-
ised by a more polarised productivity pattern than
today, that is, by more productive upwelling cells
and a slightly less productive ocean. This regime
induced a bulk increase in the global carbon transfer
to the deep ocean by about 2-4 GtC/yr and led, via
an enhanced CaC0, dissolution and alkalinity in the
deep ocean, to a significant extraction of CO, from
the surface and intermediate waters and the atmos-
phere.
"	Text
"The interglacial reduction in bioproductivity of
upwelling regions is one of the main factors leading
to both the simultaneous rise in atmosphere C0, as
recorded in ice cores and, with a delay of more than
1000 years, to a large-scale gradual C0. depletion of
the deep ocean. This conclusion is based on the
benthic carbon isotope record of CO,. The decrease
in new production matches a clear 13C depletion of
organic matter, possibly recording an end of extreme
nutrient utilisation in upwelling cells (Sarnthein et
al., 1988). Based on these results and prognostic
estimates of GCMs, Lapenis et al. (1990) predict a
decrease in productivity of upwelling zones and,
consequently, of the whole ocean under conditions
of global warming.

"Mariculture will also be affected by climatic change.
Increasing near-shore temperatures resulting from
the greenhouse effect could result in increased
production of species in established higher latitude
farming operations because of the prolonged avail-
ability of temperatures near to those optimum for
growth. Cultivation of new species of temperate and
subtropical origin could conceivably result as well.
"	Text
"While these observations and others show conse-
quences of fluctuations within a few years, it is likely
that the impacts of a far more permanent change in
temperature will be even more profound. A tem-
perature rise of about 2°C may have substantial
impact on the distribution, growth and reproduction
of the fish stocks. The commercially very important
fish stocks may take new spawning areas and their
distribution patterns may change considerably.

"tudes and the penetration of boreal organisms into
the higher latitudes. This penetration was observed
both in the North Pacific and North Atlantic; but
warming impacts on the abundance of commercially
important species can be either positive or negative,
even for the same species, depending on region. For
example, in the 1940s and 1950s, increased water
temperature coincided with the largest year of
biomass of Atlanto-Scandinavian herring, while at
the same time the North Sea herring biomass fell to
very low levels.

"In the Bering Sea, an increase was observed in
pollock stocks in the 1970s and early 1980s. The
high level of pollock stocks has been sustained
despite the high levels of exploitation. This shows
that the impact of climate may be manifested to a
lesser degree in high productivity regions in the
temperate and high latitudes such as the Bering Sea,
than in less productive regions. Above all, in the
most productive upwelling areas, the abundance of
commercially important fish has remained at rela-
tively stable levels (except for collapse of Peruvian
anchovy in 1972-73).
"	Text
"More recent fishery investigations in the North
Atlantic have revealed clear climatic influences on
growth, distribution and recruitment of commercially
important fish stocks. For example, the ‘seventies
anomaly' (Rapp, 1984) brought about considerable
impact on several fish stocks. This anomaly which
started off East Greenland in the 1960s, propagated
around Greenland and Labrador and into the North
Atlantic Current, and reached the Barents Sea in
1979-80 (Dickson et al., 1984). In the late 1960s,
this anomaly gave rise to extremely low tempera-
tures in North Icelandic waters and was the probable
reason for the change in summer distribution of the
Atlanto-Scandinavian herring.
"	Text
"Finally a decrease in ice cover could substantially
expand the geographic limits for potentially viable
commercial operations for species such as salmonids,
oysters and scallops (Frank et al., 1988). However,
a significant increase in summer seawater tempera-
tures in the Marlborough Sound in New Zealand,
for example, may have serious implications for the
salmon farming industry as these are already near
the maximum for the successful cultivation of sal-
monids (New Zealand, 1989). For wild northern
salmon, however, the strong homing instinct will
prevent populations from southern areas which are
warming up, from moving northward and they may
finally disappear from different river systems as
conditions become too severe for survival.

"The impact of U V -B radiation is of concern because
commercial and recreational species reside, during
their very early life stages, in wetlands or in neuston,
and/or feed on near-surface plankton during some
life stage of their existence. Although most sea
water may be relatively opaque to UV-B radiation,
fish eggs and larvae that float close to the surface, as
well as near-surface phytoplankton, zooplankton,
corals and wetland plants, could be exposed to levels
which will cause genetic abnormalities or direct
mortality. Recent investigations have shown that
UV-B radiation exposure could have a lethal effect
on several marine species, including anchovy,
shrimp, and crab larvae (Hunter et al., 1979). In
connection with the expected increase in the intensi-
ty of UV-B radiation, there is a need for the full
assessment of such effects on a population-wide
basis for a number of vulnerable species.

"Changes in climate will alter the species composition
and productivity of marine ecosystems supporting
major fisheries. As a first approximation of the
ability of societies to cope with changes in abun-
dance and distribution of marine resources, one can
look at the socioeconomic impacts of such changes
in the recent past. Commonly cited examples of
such changes include the collapse of the Peruvian
anchoveta, the Californian sardine, the Alaskan King
Crab, or the expansion of such fisheries as the
Bering Sea pollock and the Chilean sardine. These
provide important information about how societies
have dealt with major changes (favourable as well as
adverse) in fishery resources availability in the recent
past. For example, as fish stocks have declined
because of a combination of less favourable envi-
ronmental conditions and overfishing, industries have
often made the problem worse by continuing heavy
fishing pressure, thus accelerating the collapse of the
fishery. Frequently, industries as well as govern-
ments have been unwilling to accept the advice of

collapses of some fisheries and expansions of others.
The likelihood of collapse may be aggravated by
inadequate management due to insufficient authori-

"A major adverse impact occurs in societies having
economies which are narrowly dependent on fishery
resources and which are incapable of diversifying to
other activities. This often is the case in developing
countries bordered by major upwelling regions (eg
Mauritania, Namibia, Peru, Somalia) (Troadec,

"In general, societies have not coped well with chan-
ges in biological productivity, regardless of causes
(natural or anthropogenic) (Glantz et al., 1987).
Case studies of societal response provide insight into
how people and their governments can better pre-
pare for regional changes in distribution and abun-
dance that might accompany global warming. If, in
the face of climate change, it is desired to maintain
fisheries at levels matching society's needs, higher
levels of international collaboration might be need-

these coastal areas become navigable. National
sovereignty issues regarding international fishing,
hydroelectric power development, and freshwater
transfers may be significantly altered. In the south
polar region, warming may have implications for the
future of the Antarctic Treaty which presently holds
a number of territorial claims in abeyance. The
possibility of climate-induced changes in access and
prospects for resource development may result in
altered national positions and competing claims. It
is also recognised that the incidence of sea ice
should decrease, providing benefits to navigation.
Small sea-level rises may also be beneficial to port
operations by enabling ships to be loaded to greater
draught and still clear restricted channels. Trans-
portation aspects are treated in Chapter 5.

"Fishery management is affected by shortcomings in
the institutions for allocating scarce fish and by
limited understanding of fish reproductive strategies
with regard to environmental variability. If uncer-
tainty with regard to the abundance of fish in the
future is going to increase, regulatory institutions
will have more difficulty in adapting. Many stocks
will remain overexploited which is already the major
cause of variability. On the other hand, improve-
ment in the fishery management institutions will
reduce variability as well as the adverse effects of
equivalent changes due to global warming. There is
progress on understanding fish and their environ-
ment. Ifthe direction of potential changes in ocean
circulation could be known, useful assumptions could
be made on the likely changes in fish stock abun-
dance and, hence, on fisheries management
(Troadec, 1989). As an example of the interaction
of fisheries, their environment and fishery manage-
ment, the onset of a major El Nifio event in 1972
coupled with overexploitation and apparent recruit-
ment failure caused the Peruvian fishing industry to
suffer a severe crisis in the following years

on the terrestrial component of the cryosphere
including seasonal snow cover, mountain glaciers, ice

that remains frozen for more than one year) and

elements of the terrestrial cryosphere as a result of

"Another factor that should not be neglected in this
assessment is the influence of human activities on
seasonal snow cover, ice and permafrost. The
influence is felt mainly locally through anthropogenic
changes in the surface and quantity and quality of
the snow or ice. These changes disrupt the surface
(change in albedo, exposure of ice mass etc) and
thereby alter the ablation and degradation processes.
Examples of these disturbances are abundant,
ranging from the impact of building snow roads and
ice bridges, and of traffic on glaciers and ice sheets,
to surface disruptions during the building of struc-
tures and pipelines. In the case of snow, human
activities such as building of structures and certain

snow. In the case of glaciers and ice sheets the
impacts of the projected changes in climate are
complicated by the complex relationships between
the dynamics of these ice masses and projected
increases in temperatures and changes in precipita-
tion characteristics. Although the relationships
between permafrost and climate are complex, the
projected climatic changes will most likely lead to
increased degradation. The associated changes in
seasonal snow cover, ice and permafrost have
ramifications in terms of both local and global
hydrology (eg meltwater flow, peak discharge,
seasonal distribution of runoff and sea-level rise),
nature and distribution of vegetation, as well as
local and regional terrain stability (eg subsidence,
landslides and other mass movements).

"Changes in seasonal snow cover, ice and permafrost
can also affect climate through various feedback
mechanisms. Snow and ice surfaces have much
higher albedos than do other natural land surfaces
and, therefore, are capable of reflecting a greater
percentage of the incident solar radiation. Decreas-
ing coverage of snow and ice will, therefore, lead to
an increase in the amount of solar radiation ab-
sorbed by the earth, thereby enhancing the global
warming process. This may be further enhanced if
increased cloudiness accompanies increased warming
(see Working Group I Report). The additional
long-wave radiation from the new snow-free land
would be 'trapped' even more than at present if
cloudiness also increases. Furthermore, degradation
of permafrost could alter atmosphere-biosphere
fluxes of GH G (eg methane), thereby influencing the
amount and rate of global warming. Increased rates
of melting, however, will reduce the potential climat-
ic warming as energy is used to melt the ice.

"The impacts that GHG-induced climatic changes
would have on seasonal snow cover, particularly at
higher latitudes, are not known with certainty. In
those areas where spring temperatures are expected
to increase with early spring snowfalls becoming rain
events and, where warm air advection events could
become more frequent, the duration of snow cover
will decrease. In those areas where temperatures
are projected to remain below or at freezing and
where winters are expected to be warmer but wetter,
the snow pack will increase and hence take longer to
melt in the spring. Increased snowfall and suggested
changes in the snow cover dissipation could have
serious repercussions by delaying planting and access

"Within the Alps, Kuhn (1988) suggests that a perma-
nent snow cover will be observed only at altitudes
above 1500 m by the year 2050 as a result of the
projected changes in climate. An analysis of the
recent seasonal distribution of snow cover at 20
stations in the Alps (Fohn, 1989) found large
seasonal fluctuations with no long-term trend. The
last five to seven winters did, however, clearly show
lower than normal snow depths on 1 January.
Despite the fact that these depths were not outside
the range of normal fluctuations, continuation and
intensification of this trend would have serious
ramifications to snow dependent components of the
Alps economic communities (eg skiing and tourist
industries).

"Computer-generated climate scenarios provide some
indications of possible impacts of GHG-induced
climate changes on seasonal snow cover at a conti-
nental scale (Schlesinger, 1986). When interpreting
these results it should be noted that current versions
of these models have rudimentary simulations of the
exchanges between the ocean and the atmosphere
including the impact of sea ice and, because of their
spatial resolution, limited representation of potential
regional impacts and elevation differences. As
would be expected under the influence of global
warming, the simulations indicate that the area
covered by snow will decrease in both the southern
and northern hemispheres. In terms of the mass of
snow, however, the responses are less uniform. In
general, within the Northern Hemisphere, a decrease
in the mass of snow is indicated, whereas an in-
crease occurs within the Southern Hemisphere.
These changes in mass, however, are not uniform
but, to some degree, depend on latitude, elevation
and season. Throughout the year, snow mass north
of 30°N latitude and north of 68°S latitude is
expected to decrease in response to climatic changes,
while snow mass is expected to increase over
Antarctica, south of 68°S latitude.

"Changes in the duration and area covered by snow
could, therefore, have significant impact on local,
regional and global climates (Fohn, 1989). Where
climatic warming leads to decreased snow cover a
lowering of the surface albedo will occur. This in
turn would result in more absorption of solar ener-
gy, and thus increased warming of the adjacent air
(positive feedback). In those areas where climatic
warming results in increased snow cover, surface
albedo would increase which would decrease the
solar radiation absorbed by the surface. This would
reduce warming of the adjacent air.

of a lack of comprehensive observations. Recent
estimates (Zwally et al., 1989) using satellite obser-
vations, however, indicate that the Greenland ice
sheet has thickened by approximately a quarter of a
metre a year since the late 1970s. Zwally et al.

Antarctica, is unlikely to be significant during the
next century. In the case of the southern portion of
the Greenland ice sheet, which has huge ablation
zones in the true temperate glacier sense, surface
melting with runoff may be significant (possible
contribution to sea-level rise in the next hundred

particularly at high latitudes/altitudes where the
ground may be covered with snow from 6-9 months
each year. This albedo-temperature feedback
mechanism is related to the fact that snow, depend-
ing on its quality, has a very high albedo (0.3-0.9)
reflecting the sun's radiation 2-3 times more than
grassland and soil. In addition, although snow
absorbs and emits long-wave radiation most effec-
tively, the emission is limited by the fact that the
snow surface temperature is below 0°C. Based on
this limitation, snow cover hampers a fast warming
of the adjacent air relative to that which would occur
from a warmer, snow-free surface.

total rate of discharge are nearly in balance for this
ice sheet with a discrepancy from 0-20% (due mainly
to uncertainties in iceberg discharge, accumulation
data, and in the rates of melting below the major ice
shelves). The Antarctic ice sheet, however, is
probably still adjusting its mass balance to changes

ablation area and an annual lowcring of the
Greenland ice sheet at an average rate of 0.5-0.7

Changes in precipitation will influence ablation and

slightly more than half of the existing glacier surfac-

glaciers retreat would be converted into morpho-
logically highly unstable moraine slopes and fore-

and increased sediment loads in rivers. At high
elevations and high latitudes summer conditions are
such that the surface energy balance does not

"Permafrost is the term used to describe ground (soil
or rock) that remains at or below 0°C throughout
the year for at least two consecutive years. Perma-
frost usually contains ice in various forms, from ice
held within soil pores to massive bodies of more or
less pure ice many metres thick. The presence of
ice in permafrost makes it behave uniquely as an
earth material, and also makes it sensitive to climatic
warming. Dramatic visual evidence of permafrost
terrain such as pingos, patterned ground, earth
hummocks, ice wedges, palsas, mass movement and
thermokarst features are all dependent to some
extent on the presence of ice (and especially phase
changes of the ice) in the ground.

"Permafrost is also widespread beneath the seabed in
the Arctic Ocean (Sellman and Hopkins, 1984).
However, because of freezing point depression as a
result of the salts present, the occurrence of exten-
sive ice-bonded material is limited to the continental
shelf areas which were exposed to sub-areal condi-
tions during the Pleistocene (Hunter, 1988). Such
permafrost (submarine permafrost) may be con-
sidered as relict (permafrost which formed under
past climatic conditions and which could not form
under present conditions) and is undergoing degra-
dation (ie thawing). In coastal areas where the sea
normally freezes down to the seabed, permafrost is
contemporary.

"Changes in the amount of melt occurring and the
characteristics of glacier or ice sheet surfaces can
affect the local and possibly the global climate
(Oerlemans and van der Veen, 1984). Glaciers and
ice sheets influence climate through their impacts on
the local and global energy balance. Energy is
required to melt ice and this energy (radiation,
sensible and latent heat) is taken from the surround-
ing air (directly or indirectly) and water. Increases
in the amount of ice experiencing melt could there-
fore lead to a general cooling of the atmosphere and
surrounding waters. This potential cooling will have
a greater effect on local climate than global climate
as melting 1% of the terrestrial ice in 100 years
requires a global average of 0.06 W m’ which is
negligible compared to the CCyinduced heat fluxes.

"Antarctica, however, have in general been shrinking

currently thought to be rising at a rate of 1 to 3
mm/year (Meier, 1990) although this change is far
from uniform throughout the world. The rise in sea-
level currently observed could be partly attributed to
the wastage of alpine glaciers located in the
mountains ranges along the Gulf of Alaska, in
Central Asia, and from the Patagonian ice caps.
Also contributing to the rise in sea-level are such
processes as thermal expansion of sea water or the
tectonic effects, isostatic rebound, erosion, and

"Evidence of the existence of permafrost has been
dated as far back as 600 million bp (Tarling, 1980).
It does appear, however, that permafrost has not
persisted throughout geological time, but occurred
rather sporadically without a discernible pattern.
Most of present permafrost is many thousands of
years old and formed during the last glacial period
or Pleistocene. Permafrost containing large amounts
of ice and vulnerable to thaw is often of more
practical significance. Today, permafrost underlies
20-25% of the land surface of the earth (Figure 7.1)
in the polar and circumpolar regions, and in alpine
areas at lower latitudes. Freezing conditions in the
surface layers of the earth (seasonal and perennial)
are also found at temperate latitudes, and at high
altitude in the tropics. Elsewhere permafrost is
found in Antarctica, on high-latitude islands, in the
mountain ranges of Scandinavia, Europe, North
America, Central Asia, Chile, and South Africa, and
scattered low-latitude peaks (eg Fujiyama and
Kilimanjaro). In ice-covered regions permafrost
occurs at glacier margins and in nonglaciated oases.

"The greatest permafrost thicknesses occur as a result
of a combination of low surface temperature, low
geothermal heat flow and relatively high thermal
conductivity and are also related to the non-glaciated
past; permafrost extends to a depth of 1000 m or
more in Canada (Judge, 1973), to 1500 m in the
USSR (Melnikov, 1978), and 100-200 m in China
(Youwu and Zhou, 1983). The development of
permafrost to such thicknesses requires the persis-
tence of suitable climatic conditions on a geologic
time scale, thus, to some extent, the depth of perma-

a classification scheme in which permafrost is

in reality there is a gradual transition from the

schematically represented in Figure 7.2

altitude and latitude), although the majority are
time-dependent and closely interrelated. Another
complicating factor is the relict character of a large

Rouse (1984) found that summer soil temperatures

"Seasonal variations in moisture content of the
organic layer (thermal conductivity of peat 5-25
times that of wet or dry frozen peat) give it a low
thermal conductivity in summer, inhibiting warming
of the ground. In winter the wetter organic layer

enhancing cooling of the ground. The mean annual
ground temperatures under peat are, therefore,
lower than under adjacent areas without peat, and
permafrost can persist at sites with positive mean
annual surface temperatures (up to approximately
+2°C). Furthermore, the generally low thermal
conductivity of surface organic materials helps to
preserve relict permafrost beneath it.

"In some areas at least, the direct effect of vegetation
may be less important than its role in snow accumu-

be considerably warmer in the winter than in the
nearby tundra (Rouse, 1984). Interception of snow
by trees in areas of extensive boreal forest can
reduce the snow cover (French 1976), lowering
ground temperatures. Alternatively, a deeper snow
cover may have a net cooling effect if spring snow-
melt is prolonged, holding the ground surface
temperature at or below 0°C when air temperature
is high in early summer. The interplay of these

In the colder regions of more continuous perma-
frost, it influences the depth of the active layer. A
sufficient blanket of snow provides insulation to the
ground, thereby keeping it warmer than that which
would occur under less abundant snow cover or
snow-free conditions. Goodrich (1982) concluded
that mean annual ground temperatures are most
strongly influenced by the timing of snow accumula-

playing a relatively minor role compared to climate

movement of water and nutrients and restricts root
growth to the active layer. Low active layer tem-

"Since permafrost is a thermal condition, it is sensi-

to a large extent is inherently unstable, since it exists
so close to its melting point and frequently contains
large amounts of excess ice. Most permafrost in the
discontinuous zone is either relict, or in a delicate
thermal balance with its environment. Many thou-
sands of square kilometres of permafrost are within
1°-2°C of the melting point and are particularly
vulnerable to climatic warming. The overall effect
of the projected changes in climate will be to raise
the mean annual surface temperature, which will
result in a deeper active layer with the permafrost
table receding until an equilibrium with the new
surface temperature regime is established. The base
of the permafrost would also rise, though at a much
slower rate. If the progressive warming were great
enough, then the permafrost could eventually disap-
pear altogether, although many centuries could be
required for a complete thaw. Of more immediate
importance would be various rapid-onset effects in
areas of thaw-sensitive permafrost (that for which
the potential for thaw and subsidence are great, and
which contain up to 80% volume of ice in the upper
5-10 m). Global warming could cause the upper
layers (0-5 m) to experience accelerated thawing,
probably resulting in the disappearance of perma-
frost - on the order of decades. At the lower
latitude margins of the permafrost regions, climatic
warming will induce thickening of the active layer in
areas that continue to be underlaid by permafrost.
An example of the fairly rapid response of perma-
frost to climatic warming is the changes in the
boundary of continuous/discontinuous permafrost in

"The effects of climate on permafrost temperatures
depends on the relationships between air tempera-
ture, ground surface temperature, and the ground
thermal regime. Ground surface temperatures are
determined by the interaction between climate and
surface conditions, while ground temperatures
respond to the surface climate according to the
thermal properties of the ground and the energy
flows, phase changes etc. An increase in summer
precipitation and temperatures would greatly in-
crease ground surface temperatures (Goodwin et al.,
1984). Wide variations in ground thermal conditions
can occur within small areas of uniform climate,
although in areas of little vegetation or snow cover
the linkage between air temperatures and ground
temperatures is more direct. The range in ground
thermal conditions typically observed between sites
in close proximity can be equivalent climatically to
several degrees of latitude.

"Changes in wildlife are generally dominated by many
factors other than permafrost (see Working Group
II Report, Chapter 3). Degradation of permafrost
and its effects on vegetation and forests, however,
will influence wildlife through disruption of the
terrain, changes in surface hydrology and food
availability. It is likely that these changes could both
enhance and diminish species variability and num-
bers (Harington, 1986). For example, native arctic
species such as muskox, caribou and lemmings might
suffer due to changes in climate and to their ecol-
ogy. A northward shift of the forests would reduce
tundra and barrenlands species. Changes in wet-
lands may affect nesting areas and migration routes
for waterfowl and other birds, as well as populations
of insects and other wildlife native to these regions
through potential losses and gains (thermokarst) in
wetland areas. The overall impact on wildlife due to
the expected permafrost degradation would be dif-

large amounts of heat are expended on phase

Thaw permafrost before construction. This
approach is expensive and not used widely,

The procedure is limited to the discontinuous
permafrost regions. It is possible that climatic

) Allow for thaw during the construction and
operation of the structure. In the discontinuous
permafrost zone where consolidation and thaw
must be expected the permafrost may, under
very special conditions be allowed to thaw
during and after construction. The method
should be used only where the foundation
materials are thaw-stable or where expedient or
short-term construction is involved. Generally,
the design must allow for differential thaw and

so unreliable that the entire procedure must be

considered risky. Climatic warming would add

"Existing water-retaining structures founded on
permafrost and subjected to an increase in tempera-

risk of water seepage through the foundation will be
increased due to thaw in the foundation (as a result
of the altered heat balance between the permafrost

the dam. Heat transported by the flowing water will
accelerate thaw, exacerbating the seepage problem.
Loss of water can have serious economic conse-

consumption or for use in industrial processes.
Second, if the foundation materials are thaw sensi-
tive, a catastrophic failure could occur owing to the
reduction in strength when the frozen materials are
thawed. The failure of dams retaining water could
result in the loss of life and property downstream in
addition to the economic loss of the dam and

developed and refined, especially those capable of
operating at regional scales. To produce such
models the relationships between the temperature
of the air, precipitation, cloud cover and the
behaviour of seasonal snow cover, ice and perma-
frost need to be more precisely defined. The role
of other factors such as terrain, vegetation cover,
human disturbances and, in the case of perma-
frost, the surface organic layer require particular
attention.
"	List
"¢ Regional and local analyses of the impacts of
projected changes in climate on seasonal snow
cover, ice and permafrost are required. These
studies should be comprehensive including global-
ly representativeness, direct and secondary im-
pacts, feedback mechanisms, risk analyses, and
associated socioeconomic consequences. These
requirements can best be met through multi-
disciplinary impacts programs which include
representatives from groups typically involved in
impact studies along with botanists, economists,
foresters, sociologists, zoologists etc. To mount
these impact programs, national and international
research funding agencies should be encouraged
to support multidisciplinary impact studies. Inter-
national coordination of these impact studies is
essential and could be encouraged through co-
operation between existing national and inter-
national agencies and associations.
