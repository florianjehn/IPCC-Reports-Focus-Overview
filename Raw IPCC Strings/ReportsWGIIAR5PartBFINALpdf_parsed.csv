"There has been an evolution in the treatment of regional aspects of climate change in IPCC reports from a patchwork of case
examples in early assessments toward recent attempts at a more systematic coverage of regional issues at continental and sub-
continental scales. {21.2.2} Key topics requiring a regional treatment include changes in the climate itself and in other aspects of the climate
system (such as the cryosphere, oceans, sea level, and atmospheric composition), climate change impacts on natural resource sectors and on
human activities and infrastructure, factors determining adaptive capacity for adjusting to these impacts, emissions of greenhouse gases and
aerosols and their cycling through the Earth system, and human responses to climate change through mitigation and adaptation.

"A good understanding of decision-making contexts is essential to define the type and scale of information on climate change-
related risks required from physical climate science and impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability (IAV) assessments (high confidence).
{21.2.1} This is a general issue for all IAV assessments, but is especially important in the context of regional issues. Many studies still rely on
global data sets, models, and assessment methods to inform regional decisions. However, tailored regional approaches are often more effective
in accounting for variations in transnational, national, and local decision-making contexts, as well as across different groups of stakeholders

and sectors. There is a growing body of literature offering guidance on how to provide the most relevant climate risk information to suit specific
decision-making scales and processes.

"impact assessment studies have been carried out. Leading messages include:

Significant improvements have been made in the amount and quality of climate data that are available for establishing baseline reference
states of climate-sensitive systems. {21.5.3.1} These include new and improved observational data sets, rescue and digitization of historical
data sets, and a range of improved global reconstructions of weather sequences.

A larger set of global and regional (both dynamical and statistical) model projections allow a better characterization of ranges of plausible
climate futures than in the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) {21.3.3}, and more methods are available to produce regional probabilistic
projections of changes for use in IAV assessment work. {21.5.3}

Better process understanding would strengthen the emerging messages on future climate change where there remains significant regional
variation in their reliability. {21.3.3}

Confidence in past climate trends has different regional variability, and in many regions there is higher confidence in future changes, often
owing to a lack of evidence on observed changes. {21.3; Box 21-4}

The globally averaged combined land and ocean surface temperature data show a warming of 0.85 (0.65 to 1.06) °C, over the period
1880-2012. There is regional variation in the global trend, but overall the entire globe has warmed during the period 1901-2012.

{WGI AR5 SPM} Future warming is very likely to be larger over land areas than over oceans. {WGI AR5 SPM}

Averaged over mid-latitude land areas, precipitation has increased since 1901 (medium confidence before and high confidence after 1951),
but for other regions there is low confidence in the assessment of precipitation trends. {WGI AR5 SPM}

There are likely more land regions where the number of heavy precipitation events has increased than where it has decreased. The frequency
or intensity of heavy precipitation events has /ikely increased in North America and Europe. In other continents, confidence in changes in
heavy precipitation events is at most medium. The frequency and intensity of drought has /ikely increased in the Mediterranean and West
Africa and likely decreased in central North America and northwest Australia.

The annual mean Arctic sea ice extent decreased over the period 1979-2012 with a rate that was very likely in the range 3.5 to 4.1% per
decade. Climate models indicate a nearly ice-free Arctic Ocean in September before mid-century is likely under the high forcing scenario
Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) (medium confidence).

The average rate of ice loss from glaciers worldwide, excluding those near the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, was very likely 275 (140
to 410) Gt yr* over the period 1993-2009. By the end of the 21st century, the volume of glaciers (excluding those near the Antarctic ice
sheet) is projected to decrease by 15 to 55% for RCP2.6, and by 35 to 85% for RCP8.5, relative to 1986-2005 (medium confidence).

"¢ The rate of global mean sea level rise during the 21st century is very likely to exceed the rate observed during 1971-2010, under all RCP
scenarios. {21.3.3.5; WGI ARS SPM} By the end of the 21st century it is very likely that sea level will rise in more than about 95% of the
ocean area, with about 70% of the global coastlines projected to experience a sea level change within 20% of the global mean change.
Sea level rise along coasts will also be a function of local and regional conditions, including land subsidence or uplift and patterns of
development near the coast.

"Cross-regional phenomena can be crucial for understanding the ramifications of climate change at regional scales, and its
impacts and policies of response (high confidence). {21.4} These include global trade and international financial transactions, which are
linked to climate change as a direct or indirect cause of anthropogenic emissions; as a predisposing factor for regional vulnerability, through
their sensitivity to climate trends and extreme climate events; and as an instrument for implementing mitigation and adaptation policies.
Migration is also a cross-regional phenomenon, whether of people or of ecosystems, both requiring transboundary consideration of their
causes, implications, and possible interventions to alleviate human suffering and promote biodiversity.

"Contested definitions and alternative approaches to describing regional vulnerability to climate change pose problems for
interpreting vulnerability indicators. {21.3.1.2, 21.5.1.1} There are numerous studies that use indicators to define aspects of vulnerability,
quantifying these across regional units (e.g., by country or municipality), often weighting and merging them into vulnerability indices and
presenting them regionally as maps. However, methods of constructing indices are subjective, often lack transparency, and can be difficult to
interpret. Moreover, indices commonly combine indicators reflecting current conditions (e.g., of socioeconomic capacity) with other indicators
describing projected changes (e.g., of future climate or population), and have failed to reflect the dynamic nature of the different indicator variables.
"	Text
"There are large variations in the degree to which adaptation processes, practices, and policy have been studied and implemented
in different regions (high confidence). {21.3.2} Europe and Australia have had extensive research programs on climate change adaptation,
while research in Africa and Asia has been dominated by international partners and relies heavily on case studies of community-based adaptation.
National adaptation strategies are common in Europe, and adaptation plans are in place in some cities in Europe, the Americas, and Australasia,

with agriculture, water, and land use management the primary sectors of activity. However, it is still the case that implementation lags behind
planning in most regions of the world.

"Hotspots draw attention, from various perspectives and often controversially, to locations judged to be especially vulnerable to
climate change. {21.5.1.2} Identifying hotspots is an approach that has been used to indicate locations that stand out in terms of IAV capacity
(or combinations of these). The approach exists in many fields and the meaning and use of the term hotspots differs, though their purpose is
generally to set priorities for policy action or for further research. Hotspots can be very effective as communication tools, but may also suffer
from methodological weaknesses. They are often subjectively defined, relationships between indicator variables may be poorly understood, and
they can be highly scale dependent. In part due to these ambiguities, there has been controversy surrounding the growing use of hotspots in
decision making, particularly in relation to prioritizing regions for climate change funding.
"	Text
"There is substantial regional variation in observations and projections of climate change impacts, both because the impacts
themselves vary and because of unequal research attention. {21.3.1} Evidence linking observed impacts on biological, physical, and
increasingly) human systems to recent and ongoing regional temperature and (in some cases) precipitation changes have become more
compelling since the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). This is due both to the greater availability of statistically robust, calibrated satellite
records, and to improved reporting from monitoring sites in hitherto under-represented regions, though the disparity still remains large between
data-rich and data-poor regions. Regional variations in physical impacts such as vegetation changes, sea level rise, and ocean acidification are
increasingly well documented, though their consequences for ecosystems and humans are less well studied or understood. Projections of future
impacts rely primarily on a diverse suite of biophysical, economic, and integrated models operating from global to site scales, though some
physical experiments are also conducted to study processes in altered environments. New research initiatives are beginning to exploit the
diversity of impact model projections, through cross-scale model intercomparison exercises.

"data has expanded substantially since AR4. {21.3.3, 21.5.3} This information remains weakly coordinated, and current results indicate
that high-resolution downscaled reconstructions of the current climate can have significant errors. The increase in downscaled data sets has
not narrowed the uncertainty range. Integrating these data with historical change and process-based understanding remains an important
challenge.
"	Text
"Studies of multiple stressors and assessments of potential global and regional futures using scenarios with multiple, non-climate
elements are becoming increasingly common. {21.5.3.2-3} Non-climatic factors relevant to assessing a system's vulnerability generally
involve a complex mix of influences such as environmental changes (e.g., in air, water, and soil quality; sea level; resource depletion), land use
and land cover changes, and socioeconomic changes (e.g., in population, income, technology, education, equity, governance). All of these non-
climate factors have important regional variations. There is significant variation in vulnerability owing to variability in these factors.
"	Text
"Characterization of uncertainty in climate change research on regional scales has advanced well beyond quantifying uncertainties
in regional climate projections alone, to incorporating uncertainties in simulations of future impacts as well as considering
uncertainties in projections of societal vulnerability. {21.3.3, 21.5} In particular, intercomparison studies are now examining the
uncertainties in impacts models (e.g., Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) and Inter-Sectoral Impact Model
Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP)) and combining them with uncertainties in regional climate projections. Some results indicate that a larger
portion of the uncertainty in estimates of future impacts can be attributed to the impact models applied rather than to the climate projections
assumed. In addition, the deeper uncertainties associated with aspects of defining societal vulnerability to climate change related to the
alternative approaches to defining vulnerability are becoming appreciated. As yet there has been little research actively to quantify these
uncertainties or to combine them with physical impact and climate uncertainties.

context of the sectoral findings presented in Part A of this volume is
discussed. Third, there is an analysis of the regional variation revealed
in subsequent chapters of Part B. In so doing, the goal is to examine how
the chapters reflect differences or similarities in how decision making

"Having analyzed similarities and differences among IPCC regions, the
chapter then discusses trans-regional and cross-regional issues that
affect both human systems (e.g., trade and financial flows) and natural
systems (e.g., ecosystem migration). Finally, the chapter evaluates
methods of assessing regional vulnerabilities and adaptation, impact
analyses, and the development and application of baselines and scenarios
of the future. These evaluations provide guidance for understanding
how such methods might ultimately be enhanced, so that the confidence
in research about possible future conditions and consequences might
ultimately improve.

"This chapter serves as an introduction to Part B of this volume. It provides
context for an assessment of regional aspects of climate change in
different parts of the world, which are presented in the following nine
chapters. While the main focus of those chapters is on the regional
dimensions of impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability (IAV), this chapter
also offers links to regional aspects of the physical climate reported by
Working Group | (WGI) and of mitigation analysis reported by Working
Group III (WGIll). The chapter frames the discussion of both global and
regional issues in a decision-making context. This context identifies
different scales of decisions that are made (e.g., global, international,
regional, national, subnational, local) and the different economic or impact
sectors that are often the objects of decision making (e.g., agriculture,
water resources, energy).

when faced with large uncertainties or incomplete information, and can
help bridge adaptation strategies across scales (in particular between
the national and local levels). In most cases, an understanding of the
context in which the risk plays out, and the alternative options that may
be considered to manage it, are not an afterthought, but a defining
feature of an appropriate climate risk analysis, which requires a much
closer interplay between decision makers and providers of climate risk

"A good understanding of decision-making contexts is essential to define
the type and resolution and characteristics of information on climate
change-related risks required from physical climate science and impacts,
adaptation, and vulnerability assessments (IAV; e.g., IPCC, 2012). This
is a general issue for all IAV assessments (cf. the chapters in Part A), but
is especially important in the context of regional issues. Many studies
still rely on global data sets, models, and assessment methods to inform
regional decisions. However, tailored regional approaches are often
more effective in accounting for variations in transnational, national,
and local decision-making contexts, as well as across different groups
of stakeholders and sectors. There is a growing body of literature offering
guidance on how to provide the most relevant climate risk information
to suit specific decision-making scales and processes (e.g., Willows and
Connell, 2003; ADB, 2005; Kandlikar et al., 2011).
"	Text
"Many climate change risk assessments have traditionally been undertaken
either in the context of international climate policy making (especially
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)),
or by (or for) national governments (e.g., Roshydromet, 2008; SEI, 2009;
Watkiss et al., 2011; DEFRA, 2012). In those cases, climate risk information
commonly assumes a central role in the decision making, for instance
to inform mitigation policy, or for plans or projects designed specifically
to adapt to a changing climate. In recent years, increasing attention has
been paid to more sector- or project-specific risk assessments, intended
to guide planning and practice by a range of actors (e.g., Liu et al, 2008;
Rosenzweig et al., 2011). In those contexts, climate may often be
considered as only one contributor among a much wider set of
considerations for a particular decision. In such cases, there is uncertainty
about not only the future climate, but also many other aspects of the
system at risk. Moreover, while analysts will seek the best available
climate risk information to inform the relative costs and benefits of the
options available to manage that risk, they will also need to consider
the various constraints to action faced by the actors involved.
"	Text
"The different decision-making contexts also determine the types of
climate information required, including the climate variables of interest
and the geographic and time scales on which they need to be provided.
Many climate change impact assessments have traditionally focused on
changes over longer time horizons (often out to 2100, though recently
studies have begun to concentrate more on mid-century or earlier). In
contrast, most decisions taken today have a planning horizon ranging
from a few months to about 2 decades (e.g., Wilby et al., 2009). For many
such shorter term decisions, recent climate variability and observed
trends are commonly regarded as sufficient to inform adaptation (e.g.,
Hallegatte, 2009). However, in so doing, there is often scope to make
better use of observed climatological information as well as seasonal
and maybe also decadal climate forecasts (e.g., Wang et al., 2009;
Ziervogel et al., 2010; HLT, 2011; Mehta et al., 2011; Kirtman et al.,
2014). For longer term decisions, such as decisions with irreversible
long-term implications and investments with a long investment horizon
and substantial vulnerability to changing climate conditions, longer term
climate risk information is needed (e.g., Reeder and Ranger, 2010).
However, while that longer term information is often used simply to
plan for a best-guess scenario to optimize for most probable conditions,
there is increasing attention for informing concerns about maladaptation
(Barnett and O'Neill, 2010) and sequencing of potential adaptation
options in a wider range of possible outcomes, requiring a stronger
focus on ranges of possible outcomes and guidance on managing
uncertainties, especially at regional, national, and sub-national levels
(Hall et al., 2012; Gersonius et al., 2013).

"Some of the main topics benefiting from a regional treatment are:

Changes in climate, typically represented over sub-continental regions,
a scale at which global climate models simulate well the pattern of
observed surface temperatures, though more modestly the pattern
of precipitation (Flato et al., 2014). While maps are widely used to
represent climatic patterns, regional aggregation of this (typically
gridded) information is still required to summarize the processes
and trends they depict. Examples, including information on climate
extremes, are presented elsewhere in this chapter, with systematic
coverage of all regions provided in on-line supplementary material.
Selected time series plots of temperature and precipitation change
from an atlas of global and regional climate projections accompanying
the WGI report (Collins et al., 2014a) can also be found in several
regional chapters of this volume. In Figure 21-1, the sub-continental

"Changes in other aspects of the climate system, such as cryosphere,
oceans, sea level, and atmospheric composition. A regional treatment
of these phenomena is often extremely important to gauge real
risks, for example, when regional changes in land movements and
local ocean currents counter or reinforce global sea level rise
(Nicholls et al., 2013).

Climate change impacts on natural resource sectors, such as agriculture,
forestry, ecosystems, water resources, and fisheries, and on human
activities and infrastructure, often with regional treatment according
to biogeographical characteristics (e.g., biomes; climatic zones;
physiographic features such as mountains, river basins, coastlines,
or deltas; or combinations of these).

Adaptive capacity, which is a measure of society's ability to adjust
to the potential impacts of climate change, sometimes characterized
in relation to social vulnerability (Fiissel, 2010b) and represented
in regional statistics through the use of socioeconomic indicators.

can be found in Section 1.1.3 and elsewhere in the assessment (Blanco et al., 2014; Collins et al., 2014a; Kunreuther et al., 2014).
However, owing to the time lags that still exist between the generation of RCP-based climate change projections in the Coupled
Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5; Taylor et al, 2012) and the development of SSPs, few of the IAV studies assessed in

An inverse approach is applied, whereby the SSPs are constructed in terms of outcomes most relevant to IAV and mitigation analysis,
depicted as challenges to mitigation and adaptation. Narrative storylines for the SSPs have been outlined and preliminary quantifications
of the socioeconomic variables are underway (O'Neill et al., 2013). Priority has been given to a set of basic SSPs with the minimum
detail and comprehensiveness needed to provide inputs to impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability (IAV), and integrated assessment
models, primarily at global or large regional scales. Building on the basic SSPs, a second stage will construct extended SSPs, designed
for finer-scale regional and sectoral applications (O'Neill et al., 2013).

"Four different RCPs were developed, corresponding to four different levels of radiative forcing of the atmosphere by 2100 relative to
preindustrial levels, expressed in units of W m: RCP8.5, 6.0, 4.5, and 2.6 (van Vuuren et al., 2012). These embrace the range of
scenarios found in the literature, and all except RCP8.5 also include explicit stabilization strategies, which were missing from the
SRES set. An approximate mapping of the SRES scenarios onto the RCPs on the basis of a resemblance in radiative forcing by 2100 is
presented in Chapter 1, pairing RCP8.5 with SRES A2 and RCP 4.5 with B1 and noting that RCP6.0 lies between B1 and B2. No SRES
scenarios result in forcing as low as RCP2.6, though mitigation scenarios developed from initial SRES trajectories have been applied
in a few climate model experiments (e.g., the E1 scenario; Johns et al., 2011).

"The major socioeconomic driving factors of future emissions and their effects on the global climate system were characterized in the
TAR and AR4 using scenarios derived from the IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES; IPCC, 2000a). However, these
scenarios are becoming outdated in terms of their data and projections, and their scope is too narrow to serve contemporary user
needs (Ebi et al., 2013). More recently a new approach to developing climate and socioeconomic scenarios has been adopted in
which concentration trajectories for atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols were developed first (Representative
Concentration Pathways (RCPs); Moss et al., 2010), thereby allowing climate modeling work to proceed much earlier in the process
than for SRES. Different possible Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), intended for shared use among different climate change
research communities, were to be determined later, recognizing that more than one socioeconomic pathway can lead to the same
concentrations of GHGs and aerosols (Kriegler et al, 2012).

Chapter 19 of this volume. Chapter 2 describes other conceptual models
for decision making in the context of risk. Though this diversity in
approaches enriches our understanding of climate change, it can also

"Table 21-3 shows two ways to think about vulnerability, demonstrating
that different objectives (e.g., improving well-being and livelihoods or
reducing climate change impacts) lead to different sets of questions being
asked. This results in the selection of different methods to arrive at the
answers. The two approaches portrayed in the middle and righthand
columns of Table 21-3 have also been characterized in terms of top-down
(middle column) and bottom-up (right column) perspectives, with the
former identifying physical vulnerability and the latter social vulnerability
(Dessai and Hulme, 2004). In the middle column, the climate change
impacts are the starting point for the analysis, revealing that people
and/or ecosystems are vulnerable to climate change. This approach
commonly applies global-scale scenario information and seeks to refine
this to the region of interest through downscaling procedures. For the
approach illustrated on the right, the development context is the starting
point (i.e., social vulnerability), commonly focusing on local scales, on top
of which climate change occurs. The task is then to identify what changes
are needed in the broader scale development pathways to reduce
vulnerability to climate change. Another difference is a contrast in time
frames, where a climate change-focused approach tends to look to the
future to see how to adjust to expected changes, whereas a vulnerability-
focused approach is centered on addressing the drivers of current
vulnerability. A similar approach is described by McGray et al. (2009).

Description

Heat-health early warning systems are instruments to prevent negative health impacts during heat waves. Weather forecasts are used to predict situations
associated with increased mortality or morbidity. Components of effective heat wave and health warning systems include identifying weather situations
that adversely affect human health, monitoring weather forecasts, communicating heat wave and prevention responses, targeting notifications to vulnerable
populations, and evaluating and revising the system to increase effectiveness in a changing climate. Warning systems for heat waves have been planned and
implemented broadly, for example in Europe, the United States, Asia, and Australia.

Description Mangrove restoration and rehabilitation has occurred in a number of locations (e.g., Vietnam, Djibouti, and Brazil) to reduce coastal flooding risks and protect
shorelines from storm surge. Restored mangroves have been shown to attenuate wave height and thus reduce wave damage and erosion. They protect
aquaculture industry from storm damage and reduce saltwater intrusion.

security and reduced risks from flooding, saline intrusion, wave damage, and erosion. Restoration and rehabilitation of mangroves, as well as of wetlands or

* Synergies with mitigation given that mangrove forests represent large stores of carbon.

 Well-integrated ecosystem-based adaptation can be more cost effective and sustainable than non-integrated physical engineering approaches.

Description

Traditional technologies and skills can be relevant for climate adaptation in small island contexts. In the Solomon Islands, relevant traditional practices include
elevating concrete floors to keep them dry during heavy precipitation events and building low aerodynamic houses with palm leaves as roofing to avoid
hazards from flying debris during cyclones, supported by perceptions that traditional construction methods are more resilient to extreme weather. In Fiji after
Cyclone Ami in 2003, mutual support and risk sharing formed a central pillar for community-based adaptation, with unaffected households fishing to support
those with damaged homes. Participatory consultations across stakeholders and sectors within communities and capacity building taking into account
traditional practices can be vital to the success of adaptation initiatives in island communities, such as in Fiji or Samoa. [29.6.2]

 

Broader context

Perceptions of self-efficacy and adaptive capacity in addressing climate stress can be important in determining resilience and identifying useful solutions.

© The relevance of community-based adaptation principles to island communities, as a facilitating factor in adaptation planning and implementation, has
been highlighted, for example, with focus on empowerment and learning-by-doing, while addressing local priorities and building on local knowledge and
capacity. Community-based adaptation can include measures that cut across sectors and technological, social, and institutional processes, recognizing that
technology by itself is only one component of successful adaptation.

1950s in some parts of west-central Europe and European Russia, especially in winter (medium confidence). [SREX Table 3-2]

Increasing mean sea level with regional variations, except in the Baltic Sea where the relative sea level is decreasing due to vertical crustal motion. [5.3.2,

Description

Several governments have made ambitious efforts to address flood risk and sea level rise over the coming century. In the Netherlands, government
recommendations include “soft” measures preserving land from development to accommodate increased river inundation; maintaining coastal protection
through beach nourishment; and ensuring necessary political-administrative, legal, and financial resources. Through a multi-stage process, the British
government has also developed extensive adaptation plans to adjust and improve flood defenses to protect London from future storm surges and river
flooding. Pathways have been analyzed for different adaptation options and decisions, depending on eventual sea level rise, with ongoing monitoring of the
drivers of risk informing decisions.

(5.5.4, 23.7.1, Box 5-1]

 

Broader context

 

© The Dutch plan is considered a paradigm shift, addressing coastal protection by “working with nature” and providing “room for river.”
© The British plan incorporates iterative, adaptive decisions depending on the eventual sea level rise with numerous and diverse measures possible over the
next 50 to 100 years to reduce risk to acceptable levels.

One reason for this is the improved reporting of published studies from
hitherto under-represented regions of the world, especially in the tropics
(Rosenzweig and Neofotis, 2013). That said, the disparity is still large
between the copious evidence being presented from Europe and North
America, as well as good quality data emerging from Australasia, polar
regions, many ocean areas, and some parts of Asia and South America,

"Table 21-6 shows there are significant variations in reliability, with finer
scaled information generally less reliable given the need for a greater
density of observations and/or for models to maintain accuracy at high
resolutions. The reliability of information on past climate depends on the
availability and quality of observations, which are higher for temperature
than precipitation as observations of temperature are easier to make
and generally more representative of surrounding areas than is the case
for precipitation. Future climate change reliability depends on the
performance of the models used for the projections in simulating the
processes that lead to these changes. Again, information on temperature
is generally more reliable owing to the models’ demonstrated ability to
simulate the relevant processes when reproducing past changes. The
significant geographical variations, in the case of the observations, result
from issues with availability and/or quality of data in many regions,
especially for precipitation. For future climate change, data availability

Index-based insurance for agriculture in Africa

Exposure and vulnerability

Susceptibility to food insecurity and depletion of farmers’ productive assets following crop failure. Low prevalence of insurance due to absent or poorly
developed insurance markets or to amount of premium payments. The most marginalized and resource-poor especially may have limited ability to afford
insurance premiums.

Description Arecently introduced mechanism that has been piloted in a number of rural locations, including in Malawi, Sudan, and Ethiopia, as well as in India. When
physical conditions reach a particular predetermined threshold where significant losses are expected to occur—weather conditions such as excessively high
or low cumulative rainfall or temperature peaks—the insurance pays out.

(9.4.2, 13.3.2, 15.4.4, Box 22-1]
Broader context © Index-based weather insurance is considered well suited to the agricultural sector in developing countries.

 

© The mechanism allows risk to be shared across communities, with costs spread over time, while overcoming obstacles to traditional agricultural and disaster
insurance markets. It can be integrated with other strategies such as microfinance and social protection programs.

© Risk-based premiums can help encourage adaptive responses and foster risk awareness and risk reduction by providing financial incentives to policyholders
to reduce their risk profile.

© Challenges can be associated with limited availability of accurate weather data and difficulties in establishing which weather conditions cause losses.
Basis risk (i.e., farmers suffer losses but no payout is triggered based on weather data) can promote distrust. There can also be difficulty in scaling up pilot
schemes.

© Insurance for work programs can enable cash-poor farmers to work for insurance premiums by engaging in community-identified disaster risk reduction
projects.

FAQ 21.1 | How does this report stand alongside previous assessments
for informing regional adaptation?
"	Title
"The five major Working Group II assessment reports produced since 1990 all share a common focus that addresses
the environmental and socioeconomic implications of climate change. In a general sense, the earlier assessments
are still valid, but the assessments have become much more complete over time, evolving from making very simple,
general statements about sectoral impacts, through greater concern with regions regarding observed and projected
impacts and associated vulnerabilities, through to an enhanced emphasis on sustainability and equity, with a deeper
examination of adaptation options. Finally, in the current report there is a much improved appreciation of the
context for regional adaptation and a more explicit treatment of the challenges of decision making within a risk
management framework.
"	Text
"Obviously one can learn about the latest understanding of regional impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation in the
context of climate change by looking at the most recent report. This builds on the information presented in previous
reports by reporting developments in key topics. New and emergent findings are given prominence, as these may
present fresh challenges for decision makers. Differences with the previous reports are also highlighted—whether
reinforcing, contradicting, or offering new perspectives on earlier findings—as these too may have a bearing on
past and present decisions. Following its introduction in the TAR, uncertainty language has been available to convey
the level of confidence in key conclusions, thus offering an opportunity for calibrated comparison across successive
reports. Regional aspects have been addressed in dedicated chapters for major world regions, first defined following
the SAR and used with minor variations in the three subsequent assessments. These consist of the continental
regions of Africa, Europe, Asia, Australasia, North America, Central and South America, Polar Regions, and Small
Islands, with a new chapter on The Oceans added for the present assessment.

place as the shock or trend, but also much farther afield, sometimes in completely different parts of the world.
Regional interdependencies include both the global physical climate system as well as economic, social, and political

systems that are becoming increasingly globalized.

"Asecond approach to projecting potential future impacts is to construct
vulnerability maps. These usually combine information on three
components: exposure to a hazard (commonly defined by the magnitude
of climate change, sensitivity to that hazard), the magnitude of response
for a given level of climate change, and adaptive capacity (describing
the social and economic means to withstand the impacts of climate
change (IPCC, 2001b)). Key indicators are selected to represent each of
the three components, which are sometimes combined into a single
index of vulnerability. Indicators are usually measured quantities taken
from statistical sources (e.g., income, population), or have been modeled
separately (e.g., key climate variables). Vulnerability indices have
received close scrutiny in several recent reviews (Fiissel, 201 0b; Hinkel,
2011; Malone and Engle, 2011; Preston et al, 2011; Kienberger et al.,
2012), and a number of global studies have been critiqued by Fiissel
(2010b).

"Other local impacts can have wider socioeconomic and geopolitical consequences. For instance, extreme weather
events in one region may impact production of commodities that are traded internationally, contributing to shortages
of supply and hence increased prices to consumers, influencing financial markets and disrupting food security
worldwide, with social unrest a possible outcome of food shortages. Another example, in response to longer term
trends, is the potential prospect of large-scale migration due to climate change. Though hotly contested, this link
is already seen in the context of natural disasters, and could become an issue of increasing importance to national
and international policymakers. A third example is the shrinkage of Arctic sea ice, opening Arctic shipping routes
as well as providing access to valuable mineral resources in the exclusive economic zones of countries bordering the
Arctic, with all the associated risks and opportunities. Other examples involving both risks and opportunities include
changes of investment flows to regions where future climate change impacts may be beneficial for productivity.

"of the simulations (i.e., they are commonly aggregated to political or
topographic units of interest to the target audience, e.g., watershed,
municipality, national, or even global). Aggregation of data to coarse-
scale units is also essential for allowing comparison of outputs from
models operating at different resolutions, but it also means that
sometimes quite useful detail may be overlooked when model outputs
are presented at the scale of the coarsest common denominator.
Conversely, if outputs from impact models are required as inputs to other
models, the outputs may need to be harmonized to a finer grid than the
original data. In such cases, downscaling methods are commonly applied.
This was the case, for example, when providing spatially explicit
projections of future land use from different [AMs (Hurtt et al., 2011)
for climate modelers to apply in the CMIP5 process (Collins et al.,
201 4a). It is also a common procedure used in matching climate model

"The link between adaptation and development is explicit in Africa,
where livelihood diversification has been key to reducing vulnerability
(Section 22.4.5.2). At the same time, there is evidence that many short-
term development initiatives have been responsible for increasing
vulnerability (Section 22.4.4.2). Other chapters mention constraints or
barriers to adaptation in their regions. For example, the low priority
accorded to adaptation in parts of Asia, compared to more pressing
issues of employment and education, is attributed in part to a lack of
awareness of the potential impacts of climate change and the need
to adapt, a feature common to many regions (Section 22.5.4). All

are described as having some degree of adaptive capacity to deal with
climate variability, shifts in lifestyles combined with a loss of traditional
knowledge leave many groups more vulnerable to climate change
(Section 28.2.4.2). Also, traditional responses have been found to be
maladaptive because they are unable to adjust to the rate of change,
or the broader context in which the change is taking place, as seen in
the Arctic (28.4.1). In response to changing environmental conditions,
people are taking on maladaptive behavior—for instance, by going
further to hunt because of changed fish stocks and thus exposing
themselves to greater risk, or changing to different species and depleting
stocks (Section 28.4.1). Limits to traditional approaches for responding
to changing conditions have also been observed in several Small Island
States (29.8).

"As described in the regional chapters, a large portion of adaptation
knowledge is based on conclusions drawn from case studies in specific
locations, with the conceptual findings typically being applied globally
(Chapters 14 to 17). It is this empirical knowledge on adaptation that
guides understandings in the different regions. This is especially the case
for developing regions. Thus, regional approaches to adaptation vary in
their degree of generality. One of the most striking differences between
regions in terms of adaptation is the extent to which it has been studied
and implemented. Australia and Europe have invested heavily in research
on adaptation since the AR4, and the result is a rich body of literature
published by local scientists. The ability to advance in adaptation
knowledge may be related to the amount and quality of reliable climate
information, the lack of which has been identified as a constraint to
developing adaptation measures in Africa (Section 22.4.2). Many case
studies, especially of community-based adaptation, stem from Asia,
Africa, Central and South America, and small islands but the majority
of this work has been undertaken and authored by international non-
governmental organizations, as well as by other non-local researchers.
In Africa, most planned adaptation work is considered to be pilot and
seen as part of learning about adaptation, although there has been
significant progress since the AR4 (Section 22.4.4.2).
"	Text
"Most regional chapters report lags in policy work on adaptation (see
also Section 16.5.2). While most European countries have adaptation
strategies, few have been implemented (Section 23.1.2). Lack of
implementation of plans is also the case for Africa (Section 22.4). In North
(Section 26.8.4.1.2) and Central and South America (Section 27.5.3.2),
adaptation plans are in place for some cities. In Australasia, there are few
adaptation plans (Section 25.4.2). In the Arctic, they are in their infancy
(Section 28.4). At the same time, civil society and local communities
have the opportunity to play a role in decision making about adaptation
in Europe and Asia (Sections 23.7.2, 24.4.6.5). In Africa, social learning
and collective action are used to promote adaptation (Section 22.4.5.3).
Adaptation is observed as mostly autonomous (spontaneous) in
Africa, although socio-ecological changes are creating constraints for
autonomous adaptation (Section 22.4.5.4). There is a disconnect in most
parts of Africa between policy and planning levels, and the majority of
work is still autonomous and unsupported (Section 22.4.1). In the
case of UNFCCC-supported activities, such as National Adaptation
Programmes of Action, few projects from the African (Section 22.4.4.2)
least developed countries have been funded, thus limiting the effectiveness
of these investments. Several chapters (Africa, Europe, North America,
Central and South America, and Small Islands) explicitly point out that
climate change is only one of multiple factors that affect societies and
ecosystems and drives vulnerability or challenges adaptation (Sections
22.4.2, 23.10.1, 26.8.3.1, 27.3.1.2, 29.6.3). For example, North America
reports that for water resources, most adaptation actions are “no-
regrets,” meaning that they have benefits beyond just adaptation to
climate change (Section 26.3.4). In Australasia, the limited role of
socioeconomic information in vulnerability assessments restricts
confidence regarding the conclusions about future vulnerability and
adaptive capacity (Section 25.3.2).

"It is also important to recognize that many aspects of the climate of the next 20 years will be different from the
past. Temperatures are continuing to rise with consequent increases in evaporation and atmospheric humidity and
reductions in snow amount and snow season length in many regions. Average precipitation is changing in many
regions, with both increases and decreases, and there is a general tendency for increases in extreme precipitation
observed over land areas. There is a general consensus among climate projections that further increases in heavy
precipitation will be seen as the climate continues to warm and more regions will see significant increases or decreases
in average precipitation. In all cases the models project a range of changes for all these variables that are generally
different for different regions.

"Many of these changes may often be relatively small compared to their natural variations but it is the influence of
these changes on the specific climate variables that the system is at risk from that is important. Thus information
needs to be derived from the projected climate changes on how the characteristics of these variables, for example,
the likelihood of their occurrence or magnitude, will change over the coming 20 years. These projected future
characteristics in some cases may be indistinguishable from those historically observed but in other cases some or all
models will project significant changes. In the latter situation, the effect of the projected climate changes will then
result in a range of changes in either the frequency or magnitude of the climate event, or both. The climate risk
management strategy would then need to adapt to accounting for either a greater range or changed magnitude
of risk. This implies that in these cases a careful analysis of the implications of projected changes for the specific
temporal and spatial characteristic of the climate variables relevant to the system at risk is required.

"Community-based adaptation is happening and being planned in many
developing regions, especially in locations that are particularly poor. In
small islands, where a significant increase in the occurrence of future
sea level extremes by 2050 and 2100 is anticipated, traditional
technologies and skills may still be relevant for adapting (Table 21-4).
In the Solomon Islands, relevant traditional practices include elevating
concrete floors to keep them dry during heavy precipitation events and
building low aerodynamic houses with palm leaves as roofing to avoid
hazards from flying debris during cyclones, supported by perceptions
that traditional construction methods are more resilient to extreme
weather. In Fiji, after Cyclone Ami in 2003, mutual support and risk
sharing formed a central pillar for community-based adaptation, with
unaffected households fishing to support those with damaged homes.
Participatory consultations across stakeholders and sectors within
communities and capacity building taking into account traditional
practices can be vital to the success of adaptation initiatives in island
communities, such as in Fiji or Samoa. These actions provide more than
just the immediate benefits; they empower people to feel in control of

"As socioeconomic factors are important contributors to both the vulnerability and adaptability of human and natural systems, it clearly
makes sense to summarize and assess available climate and climate change information for these regions, as this will be relevant to
policy decisions taken within these groupings on their responses to climate change. For example, Figure 22-2 illustrates the presentation
of observed and projected climate changes of two summary statistics for five political/economic regions covering much of Africa. It
conveys several important pieces of information: the models are able to reproduce the observed trends in temperature; they simulate
significantly lower temperatures without the anthropogenic forcings and significantly higher future temperatures under typical emissions
paths; and for most regions the models project that future variations in the annual average will be similar to those simulated for the
past. However, for a more comprehensive understanding additional information needs to be included on other important aspects of

negative impacts on key socioeconomic sectors in all its countries. In response it has set up the IGAD Climate Prediction and Applications

seasonal climate forecasts for the IGAD countries as part of a World Meteorological Organization (WMO)-sponsored Regional Climate
Outlook Forum process (Ogallo et al., 2008) which perform the same function in many regions. A more recent WMO initiative, the

losing mass over the last 2 decades (high confidence), mostly due to
changes in ice flow in Antarctica, and a mix of changes in ice flow and
increases in snow/ice melt in Greenland. Ice shelves in the Antarctic
Peninsula are continuing a long-term trend of thinning and partial
collapse started some decades ago (WGI ARS Sections 4.4.2-3, 4.4.5).

likely increasing trend (medium confidence prior to 1950, high confidence
afterwards; WGI ARS Section 2.5.1). Observed precipitation trends show
a high degree of spatial and temporal variability, with both positive and
negative values (WGI ARS Section 2.5). The human influence on warming

emphasis on material deriving from dynamical and statistical downscaling
work which is often of greater relevance for IAV applications than the

"The uncertainty in near-term CMIP5 projections is dominated by internal
variability of the climate system (see ‘Climate Variability’ in Glossary),
initial ocean conditions, and inter-model response, particularly at smaller
spatial and temporal scales (Hawkins and Sutton, 2009, 2011). In the
medium and long term, emission profiles may affect the climate response.
Global warming of 0.3°C to 0.7°C is likely for the period of 2016-2035
compared to 1986-2005 based on the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble,
and spatial patterns of near-term warming are generally consistent with
the AR4 (WGI ARS Section 11.3.6). For precipitation (2016-2035 vs.
1986-2005), zonal mean precipitation will very likely increase in high
and some of the mid-latitudes, and will more likely than not decrease
in the subtropics (WGI ARS Section 11.3.2). Results from multi-decadal
near-term prediction experiments (up to 2035) with initialized ocean
state show that there is some evidence of predictability of yearly to
decadal temperature averages both globally and for some geographical
regions (WGI ARS Section 11.2.3).

applied to produce regional climate change projections, often as part
of multi-model intercomparison projects (Gérgen et al, 2010). A large

PRUDENCE (Christensen et al. 2007; Deque et al., 2007) and ENSEMBLES

(grid interval of ~12 km) were also produced as part of Euro-Coordinated
Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX; Jacob et al 2013). All
these studies provide a generally consistent picture of seasonally and
latitudinally varying patterns of change, which Giorgi and Coppola (2007)
summarized with the term “European Climate Change Oscillation (ECO).”
The ECO consists of a dipole pattern of precipitation change, with
decreased precipitation to the south (Mediterranean) and increased to
the north (Northern Europe) following a latitudinal/seasonal oscillation.

"By modifying the Earth's energy and water budgets, climate change may
possibly lead to significant changes in hydroclimatic regimes and major
modes of climate variability (Trenberth et al., 2003). For example, Giorgi
et al. (2011) defined an index of hydroclimatic intensity (HY-INT)
incorporating a combined measure of precipitation intensity and mean
dry spell length. Based on an analysis of observations and global and
regional climate model simulations, they found that a ubiquitous global
and regional increase in HY-INT was a strong hydroclimatic signature
in model projections consistent with observations for the late decades
of the 20th century. This suggests that global warming may lead to a
hydroclimatic regime shift toward more intense and less frequent
precipitation events, which would increase the risk of both flood and
drought associated with global warming.

varied patterns of temperature and precipitation change, depending on
the global and regional models used; however, a consistent change found
in many of these studies was an increase in both precipitation intensity
and extremes, especially in areas where mean precipitation was projected
to also increase. The Central American region has emerged as a prominent
climate change hotspot since the AR4, especially in terms of a consistent
decrease of precipitation projected by most models, particularly in June
to July (Rauscher et al., 2008, 2011). Regional model studies focusing

the East Asia continent. While some of these find increases in monsoon

those from GCMs. For example, both Ashfaq et al. (2009) and Gao et al.
(2011) found in high-resolution RCM experiments (20- and 25-km grid
spacing, respectively) decreases in monsoon precipitation over areas of
India and China in which the driving GCMs projected an increase in

include a series of double-nested RCM scenario runs for the Korean

higher resolution climate change projections over North America based
on RCMs and high-resolution global time slices (e.g., Salathe et al.,

as part of the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment
Program (NARCCAP; Mearns et al., 2009, 2012, 2013). Results indicate
variations (and thus uncertainty) in future climate based on the different
RCMs, even when driven by the same GCM in certain subdomains
(De Elia and Cote, 2010; Bukovsky et al., 2013; Mearns et al., 2013).
However, in the NARCCAP suite of simulations there were also some
important commonalities in the climate changes produced by the RCMs.
For example, they produced larger and more consistent decreases in
precipitation throughout the Great Plains in summer than did the driving
GCMs or the full suite of CMIP3 GCM simulations as well as larger
increases in precipitation in the northern part of the domain in winter.
In the realm of statistical downscaling and spatial disaggregation,
considerable efforts have been devoted to applying different statistical

"Global trade and international financial transactions are the motors of
modern global economic activity. Their role as key instruments for
implementing mitigation and adaptation policies is explored in detail
in Chapters 14 to 17 and in the WGIII AR5 (Gupta et al., 2014; Stavins
et al., 2014).
"	Text
"The following sections consider some examples of these phenomena,
focusing on trade and financial flows and migration. Though these issues
are treated in more detail in Part A of this report, they are restated here
in Part B to stress the importance of a global perspective in appreciating
climate change challenges and potential solutions at the regional scale.
"	Text
"these issues can be studied and described, in situ, in the regions in
which they occur. However, there is a separate class of issues that
transcends regional boundaries and demands a different treatment. To
understand such cross-regional phenomena, knowledge is required of
critical but geographically remote associations and of dynamic cross-
boundary flows.
"	Text
"They are also inextricably linked to climate change (WTO and UNEP, 2009)
through a number of other interrelated pathways that are expanded
here: (1) as a direct or indirect cause of anthropogenic emissions (e.g.,
Peters et al., 2011), (2) as contributory factors for regional vulnerability
to the impacts of climate change (e.g., Leichenko and O’Brien, 2008),
and (3) through their sensitivity to climate trends and extreme climate
events (e.g., Nelson et al., 2009a; Headey, 2011).
"	Text
"The contemporary world is highly dependent on trading relationships
between countries in the import and export of raw materials, food and
fiber commodities, and manufactured goods. Bulk transport of these
products, whether by air, sea, or over land, is now a significant contributor
to emissions of GHGs and aerosols (Stavins et al., 2014). Furthermore,
the relocation of manufacturing has transferred net emissions via
international trade from developed to developing countries (see Figure
21-10), and most developed countries have increased their consumption-
based emissions faster than their domestic (territorial) emissions (Peters
et al., 2011).
"	Text
"This regional transfer of emissions is commonly referred to in climate
policy negotiations as “carbon leakage” (Barker et al., 2007)—though
only a very small portion of this can be attributed to climate policy
(“strong carbon leakage""), a substantial majority being due to the effect
of non-climate policies on international trade (""weak carbon leakage”;
Peters, 2010). A particular example of strong carbon leakage concerns
the conversion of land use from the production of food to bioenergy
crops. These crops sequester carbon otherwise extracted from the
ground as fossil fuels, but in the process displace demand for food
production to land in other regions, often inducing land clearance and
hence an increase in emissions (Searchinger et al., 2008), though the
empirical basis for this latter assertion is disputed (see Kline and Dale,
2008).
"	Text
"Projections of regional sea level changes, based both on the CMIP3
and CMIP5 models, indicate a large regional variability of sea level rise
(even more than 100% of the global mean sea level rise) in response
to different regional processes (WGI AR5 Section 13.6.5). However, by
the end of the 21st century it is very likely that more than about 95%
of the oceans will undergo sea level rise, with about 70% of coastlines
experiencing a sea level rise within 20% of the global value and most
regions experiencing sea level fall being located near current and former
glaciers and ice sheets (WGI AR5 Section 13.6.5). Some preliminary
analysis of the CMIP5 ensembles indicates areas of maximum steric sea
level rise in the Northern Atlantic, the northwestern Pacific off the East
Asia coasts, the eastern coastal oceanic regions of the Bay of Bengal,
and the western coastal regions of the Arabian Sea (WGI ARS Section
13.6.5).
"	Text
"Since the AR4 more studies have become available addressing the issue
of the effects of both climate and emission changes on air quality. Most
of these studies focused on the continental USA and Europe, and
utilized both global and regional climate and air quality models run in
off-line or coupled mode. Regional modeling studies over the USA or
some of its sub-regions include, for example, those of Hogrefe et al.
(2004), Knowlton et al. (2004), Dawson et al. (2007), Steiner et al.
(2006), Lin et al. (2008), Zhang et al. (2008), and Weaver et al. (2009),
while examples of global modeling studies include Doherty et al. (2006),
Murazaki and Hess (2006), Shindell et al. (2006), and Stevenson et al.
(2006). Weaver et al. (2009) provide a synthesis of simulated effects of
climate change on ozone concentrations in the USA using an ensemble
of regional and global climate and air quality models, indicating a
predominant increase in near-surface ozone concentrations, particularly
in the eastern USA (Figure 21-9) mostly tied to higher temperatures and
corresponding biogenic emissions. An even greater increase was found
in the frequency and intensity of extreme ozone concentration events,
which are the most dangerous for human health. Examples of regional
studies of air quality changes in response to climate change over Europe
include Langner et al. (2005), Forkel and Knocke (2006), Meleux et al.
(2007), Szopa and Hauglustaine (2007), Kruger et al. (2008), Engardt et
al. (2009), Andersson and Engardt (2010), Athanassiadou et al. (2010),
Carvalho et al. (2010), Katragkou et al. (2010, 2011), Huszar et al.
(2011), Zanis et al. (2011), and Juda-Rezler et al. (2012). All of these
studies indicated the potential of large increases in near-surface summer
ozone concentrations especially in Central and Southern Europe due to
much warmer and drier projected summer seasons.

"The increasingly international nature of trade and financial flows
(commonly referred to as globalization), while offering potential benefits
for economic development and competitiveness in developing countries,
also presents high exposure to climate-related risks for some of the

O'Brien, 2008). Examples of these risks, explored further in Chapters 7
to 9, 12, 13, and 19, include:

"Climate trends and extreme climate events can have significant
implications for regional resource exploitation and international trade
flows. The clearest example of an anticipated, potentially major impact
of climate change concerns the opening of Arctic shipping routes as well
as exploitation of mineral resources in the exclusive economic zones
(EEZs) of Canada, Greenland/Denmark, Norway, the Russian Federation,
and the USA (Figure 21-11, see also Section 28.3.4).

"communication with the diaspora in times of severe weather and
other extreme events can provide rapid access to resources to aid
recovery and reduce vulnerability (Downing, 2012).

Some aspects of international disaster relief, especially the provision
of emergency food aid over protracted periods, has been cited as an
impediment to enhancing adaptive capacity to cope with climate-
related hazards in many developing countries (Schipper and Pelling,
2006). Here, international intervention, while well-intentioned to
relieve short-term stress, may actually be counterproductive in regard
to the building of long-term resilience.

"Indeed, in 2009, two ice-hardened cargo vessels—the Beluga Fraternity
and Beluga Foresight—became the first to successfully traverse the
Northeast Passage from South Korea to The Netherlands, a reduction of
5500 km and 10 days compared to their traditional 20,000-km route
via the Suez Canal, translating into an estimated saving of some
US$300,000 per ship, including the cost of standby icebreaker assistance
(Smith, 2009; Det Norsk Veritas, 2010). A projection using an earlier
version of the CCSM sea ice model under the SRES A1B scenario, but
offering similar results (with forcing by mid-century lying just below
RCP8.5; Figure 1-5a), is presented in Figure 21-11 (peripheral maps),
which also portrays winter transportation routes on frozen ground.
These routes are heavily relied on for supplying remote communities
and for activities such as forestry and, in contrast to the shipping routes,
are projected to decline in many regions.

Severe impacts of food price spikes in many developing countries
(including food riots and increased incidence of child malnutrition)
such as occurred in 2008 following shortfalls in staple cereals, due
to a coincidence of regional weather extremes (e.g., drought) in
producer countries, the reallocation of food crops by some major
exporters for use as biofuels (an outcome of climate policy; see
previous section), and market speculation (Ziervogel and Ericksen,
2010). Prices subsequently fell back as the world economy went
into recession, but spiked again in early 2011 for many of the same
reasons (Trostle et al., 2011), with some commentators predicting
a period of rising and volatile prices due to increasing demand and
competition from biofuels (Godfray et al., 2010).

A growing dependence of the rural poor on supplementary income
from seasonal urban employment by family members and/or on
international financial remittances from migrant workers (Davies
et al., 2009). These workers are commonly the first to lose their jobs
in times of economic recession, which automatically decreases the
resilience of recipient communities in the event of adverse climate
conditions. On the other hand, schemes to provide more effective

"For instance, the Community Climate System Model 4 (CCSM4) climate
and sea ice model has been used to provide projections under RCP4.5,
RCP6.0, and RCP8.5 forcing (see Box 21-1) of future accessibility for
shipping to the sea ice hazard zone of the Arctic marine environment
defined by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) (Stephenson
et al., 2013; Figure 21-11, central map). Results suggest that moderately
ice-strengthened ships (Polar Class 6), which are estimated under
baseline (1980-1999) conditions to be able to access annually about
36% of the IMO zone, would increase this access to 45 to 48% by
2011-2030, 58 to 69% by 2046-2065, and 68 to 93% by 2080-2099,
with almost complete accessibility projected for summer (90 to 98% in
July to October) by the end of the century (Stephenson et al., 2013). The
robustness of those findings was confirmed using seven sea ice models
in an analysis of optimal sea routes in peak season (September) for
2050-2069 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 forcing (Smith and Stephenson,
2013). All studies imply increased access to the three major cross Arctic
routes: the Northwest Passage, Northern Sea Route (part of the Northeast
Passage), and Trans-Polar Route (Figure 21-11), which could represent
significant distance savings for trans-continental shipping currently
using routes via the Panama and Suez Canals (Stephenson et al., 2011).

"Migration can also be international, though this is less common in response
to extreme weather events, and where it does happen it usually occurs
along well established routes. For example, emigration following Hurricane
Mitch tripled from Honduras and increased from Nicaragua by 40%,
mainly to the southern states of the USA (already a traditional destination
for migrants), and was aided by a relaxation of temporary residency
requirements by the USA (Naik, 2009).
"	Text
"The spatial dimension of climate-related migration is most commonly
internal to nations (e.g., from affected regions to safer zones; Naik, 2009).
In this context it is also worth pointing out that internal migration for
other (predominantly economic) reasons may actually expose populations
to increased climate risk. For instance, there are large cities in developing
countries in low-elevation coastal zones that are vulnerable to sea level
rise. Increased migration to these cities could exacerbate the problems,
with the migrants themselves being especially vulnerable (Nordas and
Gleditsch, 2007; UNFPA, 2007).
"	Text
"There has been considerable debate in recent years around the postulate
that anthropogenic climate change and environmental degradation
could lead to mass migration (Perch-Nielsen et al., 2008; Feng et al.,
2010; Warner, 2010; Black et al., 2011; Foresight, 2011; Assan and
Rosenfeld, 2012). The issue is treated at length in Chapters 9, 12, and 19,
so only a few aspects are touched on here, to highlight the growing
significance of migration in all regions of the world. Four possible
pathways through which climate change could affect migration are
suggested by Martin (2009):

"Abundant historical evidence exists to suggest that changes in climatic
conditions have been a contributory factor in migration, including large
population displacements in the wake of severe events such as Hurricane
Katrina in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA, in 2005 (Cutter et al., 2012),
Hurricane Mitch in Central America in 1998, and the northern Ethiopian
famines of the 1980s (McLeman and Smit, 2006). Other examples are
provided in Table 12-3. However, the evidence is not clear cut (Black,
2001), with counterexamples also available of migration being limited
due to economic hardship (e.g., during the Sahel drought of the mid-
1980s in Mali; Findley, 1994).

"Forced migration appears to be an emerging issue requiring more
scrutiny by governments in organizing development cooperation, and
to be factored into international policy making as well as international
refugee policies. For example, it has been suggested that the National
Adaptation Plans of Action (NAPAs) under the UNFCCC, by ignoring
transboundary issues (such as water scarcity) and propounding nationally
orientated adaptation actions (e.g., upstream river management, to the
detriment of downstream users in neighboring countries), could potentially
be a trigger for conflict, with its inevitable human consequences.

Sections 9.3.3.3.1,12.4, 19.4.2.1), though useful insights can be gained
from studying past abandonment of settlements (McLeman, 2011). Thus
projecting future climate-related migration remains a challenging
research topic (Feng et al., 2010). There are also psychological, symbolic,
cultural, and emotional aspects to place attachment, which are well
documented from other non-climate causes of forced migration, and
are also applicable to cases of managed coastal retreat due to sea level

"Extreme climate phenomena that may be harbingers of similar and
more frequent events in a warmer world, already exact devastating
consequences in some regions that extend well beyond country
boundaries. A recent event that disrupted international trade and
commodity flows was the severe 2010/2011 flooding in eastern Australia
(Giles, 2011; Queensland Floods Commission of Inquiry, 2012; see also
Box 25-8), which, combined with damaging cyclones in Queensland and
western Australia, curtailed numerous mining operations and damaged
transportation networks, leading to declines in both thermal and
metallurgical coal exports (by 31 and 19%, respectively, relative to the
previous quarter; ABARES, 2011), with a sharp rise in their monthly price
between November 2010 and January 2011 (Index Mundi, 2012). The
severe weather was the primary factor contributing to a fall in Australian
GDP of 1.2% during January to March 2011 compared with a rise of 0.7%
in the preceding 3-month period (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2011).

"A second illustration of how the risk of adverse climate changes may
have contributed to anticipatory adaptive actions affecting countries in
other regions of the world and potentially influencing commodity markets
relates to the purchase or renting of large tracts of productive land in
parts of Africa, South America and the Caribbean, Central Asia, and
Southeast Asia by countries in Europe, Africa, the Gulf, and South and
East Asia (De Schutter, 2009; Cotula et al., 2011; Zoomers, 2011). While
there is clearly a profit motive in many of these purchases (ie., cheap and
fertile land and the opportunity to cultivate high value food or biofuel
crops), there is also a concern that domestic agricultural production in
some countries will be unable to keep pace with rapid growth in domestic
demand and changing dietary preferences, especially in agricultural
regions affected by frequent shortfalls due to droughts, floods, and
cyclones (Cotula et al., 2011), or threatened by sea level rise (Zoomers,
2011). Land acquisition on such a large scale raises a number of ethical
issues relating to local access to food and the appropriate and sustainable
management of the land (Deininger and Byerlee, 2012). These issues
have led the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to food to recommend
a list of 11 principles for ensuring informed participation of local
communities, adequate benefit sharing, and the respect of human rights
(De Schutter, 2009). This issue is elaborated with respect to livelihoods
and poverty in Section 13.4.3.4, and land dispossession is categorized
as a key risk in Section 19.6.2.

displacement of biogeographical zones and the natural migration of
species (see Chapters 4, 6, 19). General warming of the climate can be
expected to result in migration of ecosystems toward higher latitudes
and upward into higher elevations (Section 4.3.2.5) or downward to
cooler depths in marine environments (Section 6.3.2.1). Species shifts
are already occurring in response to recent climate changes in many

adaptation and the processes of adaptation decision making are treated
in detail in Chapters 14 to 17, so not addressed here). This is followed
by assessments of new information on, and thinking related to, baseline

of cross-border movements provoked by new factors such as climate

"Conservation policy under a changing climate is largely a matter of
promoting the natural adaptation of ecosystems, if this is even feasible
for many species given the rapidity of projected climate change. Studies
stress the risks of potential mismatching in responses of co-dependent
species to climate change (e.g., Schweiger et al., 2012) as well as the
importance of maintaining species diversity as insurance for the provision
of basic ecosystem services (e.g., Traill et al., 2010; Isbell et al, 2011).
Four priorities have been identified for conservation stakeholders to
apply to climate change planning and adaptation (Heller and Zavaleta,
2009): (1) regional institutional coordination for reserve planning and
management and to improve landscape connectivity; (2) a broadening
of spatial and temporal perspectives in management activities and
practice, and actions to enhance system resilience; (3) mainstreaming
of climate change into all conservation planning and actions; and (4)
holistic treatment of multiple threats and global change drivers, also
accounting for human communities and cultures. The regional aspects
of conservation planning transcend political boundaries, again arguing
for a regional (rather than exclusively national) approach to adaptation
policy. This issue is elaborated in Sections 4.4.2 and 19.4.2.3.

"Study of the estimated shifts of climatic zones alone can provide insights
into the types of climatic regimes to anticipate under projected future
anthropogenic climate change. By grouping different combinations and
levels of climatic variables it is possible not only to track the shifts in
the zones in which they occur, but also to identify newly emerging
combinations of conditions not found at the present day as well as
combinations that may not survive global climate change (known
respectively as novel and disappearing climates; Williams et al., 2007;
see also Section 19.5.1). These analyses can help define what types of
climatic niches may be available in the future and where they will be
located. Such a spatial analog approach can delimit those regions that
might currently or potentially (in the future) be susceptible to invasion
by undesirable aquatic (e.g., EPA, 2008) or terrestrial (e.g., Mainka and
Howard, 2010) alien species or alternatively might be candidates for
targeting translocation (assisted colonization) of species endangered
in their native habitats (e.g., Brooker et al., 2011; Thomas, 2011). However,
there are many questions about the viability of such actions, including
genetic implications (e.g., Weeks et al., 2011), inadvertent transport of
pests or pathogens with the introduced stock (e.g., Brooker et al., 2011),
and risk of invasiveness (e.g., Mueller and Hellmann, 2008).

which are composites of several indicators thought to contribute to

combined (Adger et al., 2004; Rygel et al., 2006). The approach has been
critiqued extensively because the weights assigned the indicators depend
on expert opinion which can result in different regions appearing more or
less vulnerable, as Filssel (2010b) found in reviewing global vulnerability
maps based on different indices.

of adaptive capacity. These are used both to measure adaptive capacity
and identify entry points for enhancing it (Adger and Vincent, 2005;
Eriksen and Kelly, 2007; Swanson et al., 2007; Lioubimtseva and Henebry,
2009; Adaptation Sub-Committee, 2011). For example, the Global
Adaptation Index, developed by the Global Adaptation Alliance (GAIN,
n.d.), uses a national approach to assess vulnerability to climate change
and other global challenges and compare this with a country’s “Readiness
to improve resilience” (GAIN, n.d.) to assist public and private sectors
to prioritize financial investments in adaptation activities.

"Vulnerability indices developed to date have failed to reflect the
dynamic nature of component indicator variables. This is illustrated by
the (in)ability to characterize how the selected indicators contribute to
determining vulnerability over time. Significantly, the relative importance
of the indicator may change from season-to-season (e.g., access to
irrigation water) or may gradually or rapidly become obsolete. Hinkel’s
(2011) review of literature on vulnerability indicators suggests that
vulnerability has been confused as a proxy for unsustainable or insufficient
development so that simple measurements are seen as sufficient to tell
a story about vulnerability. Hinkel (2011) suggests that the simplification
of information to create vulnerability indicators is what limits their
utility.

"Several attempts have been made to develop vulnerability indicators
and indices (Atkins et al., 2000; Downing et al., 2001; Moss et al., 2001;

Representation on a map or through an index is a common way to
depict global vulnerability information and requires quantification of
selected variables in order to measure them against a selected baseline,
even though quantification of some qualitative information may not
be possible (Luers et al., 2003; Edwards et al., 2007; Hinkel, 2011).
Vulnerability is differentiated according to factors such as gender, age,
livelihood, or access to social networks, among many other factors
(Wisner et al. 2004; Cardona et al., 2012), which may not be represented

"Certain locations are considered hotspots because of their regional or
global importance. These can be defined by population size and growth
rate, contributions to regional or global economies, productive significance
(e.g., food production) as well as by disaster frequency and magnitude,
and projected climate change impacts. The choice of variables may
result in different locations being identified as hotspots (Ftissel, 2009).
For example, the Consultative Group on International Agricultural
Research (CGIAR) Research Program on Climate Change Agriculture and
Food Security (CCAFS) mapped hotspots of food insecurity and climate
change in the tropics (Ericksen et al, 2011) using stunted growth as a
proxy for food security, but other variables could also have been
selected. Scale matters in representing hotspots and they will look
different on a global scale than on a finer scale (Arnold et al., 2006).
"	Text
"The rationale for identifying such hotspots is that they may gradually
evolve into locations of conflict or disaster, where a combination of
factors leads to the degradation of resources and social fabric. Climate
change hotspots have been defined as locations where impacts of climate
change are “well pronounced and well documented” (UCS, 2011). A
climate change hotspot can describe (1) a region for which potential
climate change impacts on the environment or different activity sectors
can be particularly pronounced or (2) a region whose climate is especially
responsive to global change (Giorgi, 2006). An example of the former
is given by Fraser et al. (2013), combining hydrological modeling with
quantitatively modeled adaptive capacity (defined as the inverse of
sensitivity to drought) to identify vulnerability hotspots for wheat and
maize. Examples of the latter are given by Giorgi (2006), Diffenbaugh et

"A special case of the use of indicators concerns the identification of
hotspots, a term originally used in the context of biodiversity, where a
“biodiversity hotspot” is a biologically diverse region typically under
threat from human activity, climate change, or other drivers (Myers,
1988). The term typically relates to a geographical location, which
emerges as a concern when multiple layers of information are compiled
to define it. In climate change analysis, hotspots are used to indicate
locations that stand out in terms of impacts, vulnerability, or adaptive
capacity (or all three). Examples of hotspot mapping include how climate
change can influence disease risk (de Wet et al., 2001), extinctions of
endemic species (Malcolm et al., 2006), and disaster risk (Dilley, 2006).
Hotspots analysis is used to serve various purposes, such as setting
priorities for policy action, identifying focal regions for further research
(Dilley, 2006; Ericksen et al, 2011; de Sherbinin, 2013; see also www.
climatehotmap.org), of, increasingly, helping distinguish priority locations
for funding. Examples of the latter purpose include guiding the allocation
of global resources to pre-empt, or combat, disease emergence (Jones
et al., 2008) or funding for disaster risk management (Arnold et al.,
2005). Because identifying hotspots raises important methodological
issues about the limitation of using indicators to integrate quantitative
impacts with qualitative dimensions of vulnerability, their use to compare
regions leads to a subjective ranking of locations as having priority for
climate change investment. This can be controversial and considered
politically motivated (Klein, 2009).

"Potential impacts have been simulated for single as well as multiple
sectors, at spatial scales ranging from site or household to global, and over

impacts are modelled based on a set of assumptions (scenarios) about
future climate and socioeconomic conditions (see Section 21.2.3, lefthand

that follow a “socio-institutional” approach to adaptation planning
(Downing, 2012), righthand side of Table 21-3, which emphasizes the
importance of adaptive flexibility and climate resilience given the often
intractable, “deep” uncertainties implicit in many projections of future

"Impact modeling studies also commonly treat aspects of adaptation,
either explicitly as modeled options or implicitly as built-in autonomous
responses (Dickinson, 2007; White et al., 2011). Furthermore, as an
anthropogenic signature is attributed to ongoing climate changes in
many regions (Bindoff et al., 2014), and with growing evidence that
these changes are having impacts on natural and human systems in
many more regions than reported in the AR4 (Chapter 18; Rosenzweig
and Neofotis, 2013), it is now possible in some regions and sectors to
test impact models’ projections against observed impacts of recent
climate change (e.g., Araujo et al, 2005; Barnett et al., 2008; Lobell et

"In recent years, there has been increased scrutiny of the methods and
tools applied in impact assessment, especially quantitative models that
are used to project the biophysical and socioeconomic impacts of future

methods, including studies of indigenous knowledge (Section 12.3.3).
In an advance from previous assessments, different types of impact
models are now being applied for the first time in many regions of the
world. This is largely due to burgeoning international development
support for climate change vulnerability and adaptation studies
(Fankhauser, 2010). It is also related to a surge of interest in regional
economic assessments in the wake of the Stern review (Stern, 2007) as
well as to the evolution of climate models into Earth system models
that incorporate a more realistic representation of land surface
processes (Flato et al., 2014) and their increased application to study

areas such as flood risk (Ward et al., 2013). Furthermore, research has
advanced to establish which future climate uncertainties are most
important to the resultant uncertainties about crop yields (e.g., Lobell and
Burke, 2008) and to apply future resource uncertainties to adaptation
studies (Howden et al., 2007). Use of multiple global or regional model
scenarios is now found in many more studies (e.g., Arnell, 2011; Bae et al.,
2011; Gosling et al. 2011; Olsson et al., 2011), and the use of probabilistic
quantification of climate uncertainties has produced estimates of
probabilities of changes in future resources such as agriculture and
water (e.g., Tebaldi and Lobell, 2008; Watterson and Whetton, 2011).
Some studies have developed probability distributions of future impacts
by combining results from multiple climate projections and, sometimes,
different emissions scenarios, making different assumptions about the
relative weight to give to each scenario (Brekke et al., 2009). Nobrega
et al. (2011) apply six different GCMs and four different SRES emissions
scenarios to study the impacts of climate change on water resources in
the Rio Grande Basin in Brazil and found that choice of GCM was the
major source of uncertainty in terms of river discharge.

"With an ever-increasing number of impacts’ projections appearing in the
literature and the unprecedented rate and magnitude of climate change
projected for many regions, some authors have begun to question both
the robustness of the impacts models being applied (e.g., Heikkinen et
al., 2006; Fitzpatrick and Hargrove, 2009; Watkiss, 201 1a) as well as the
methods used to represent key uncertainties in impacts’ projections
(eg., Arnell, 2011; Rotter et al., 2011; White et al, 2011). This is being
addressed through several prominent international research efforts:
AgMIP, involving crop and economic models at different scales
(Rosenzweig et al., 2013), the Carbon Cycle Model Intercomparison
Project (C4MIP; Friedlingstein et al., 2006; Sitch et al., 2008; Arora et
al., 2013), and the Water Model Intercomparison Project (WaterMIP;
Haddeland et al., 2011). Modeling groups from these projects are also
participating in the ISI-MIP, initially focusing on intercomparing global
impact models for agriculture, ecosystems, water resources, health, and
coasts under RCP- and SSP-based scenarios (see Box 21-1) with regional
models being considered in a second phase of work (Schiermeier, 2012).
AgMIP results for 27 wheat models run at contrasting sites worldwide
indicate that projections of yield to the mid-21st century are more sensitive
to crop model differences than to global climate model scenario differences
(Asseng et al., 2013; Carter, 2013). WaterMIP’s analysis of runoff and
evapotranspiration from five global hydrologic and six land surface
models indicate substantial differences in the models’ estimates in these
key parameters (Haddelenad et al., 2011). Finally, as in climate modeling,
researchers are now applying multiple impact model and perturbed
parameter ensemble approaches to future projections (e.g., Araujo and
New, 2007; Jiang et al., 2007; Palosuo et al., 2011), usually in combination
with ensemble climate projections treated discretely (e.g., New et al.,
2007; Graux et al., 2013; Tao and Zhang, 2013) or probabilistically (e.g.,

"This section deals with defining baseline information for assessing climate
change IAV. The baseline refers to a reference state or behavior of a
system, for example, current biodiversity of an ecosystem, or a reference
state of factors (e.g., agricultural activity, climate) that influence that
system (see Glossary). For example, the UNFCCC defines the preindustrial
baseline climate, prior to atmospheric composition changes from its
baseline preindustrial state, as a reference for measuring global average
temperature rises. A baseline may be used to characterize average
conditions and/or variability during a reference period, or may allude to
a single point in time, such as a reference year. It may provide information
on physical factors such as climate, sea level, or atmospheric composition,
or on arrange of non-climate factors, such as technological, land use, or
socioeconomic conditions. In many cases a baseline needs to capture
much of a system's variability to enable assessment of its vulnerability
or to test whether significant changes have taken place. Thus the
information used to establish this baseline must account for the variability
of the factors influencing the system. In the case of climate factors often
this requires 30 years of data (e.g., Jones et al., 1997) and sometimes
substantially more (e.g., Kendon et al., 2008). In addition, temporal and
spatial properties of systems will influence the information required. Many
depend on high-resolution information, for example, urban drainage
systems (high spatial scales) or temperature-sensitive organisms (sub-
daily time scales). This section assesses methods to derive relevant
climatic and non-climatic information and its reliability.

information on its variability on time scales of days to decades. This
has motivated significant efforts to enhance the quality, length, and
homogeneity of, and make available, observed climate records (also
important for monitoring, detecting, and attributing observed climate
change; Bindoff et al., 2014; Hartmann et al., 2014; Masson-Delmotte
et al., 2014; Rhein et al., 2014; Vaughan et al., 2014). This has included
generating new data sets such as Asian Precipitation — Highly Resolved
Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation (APHRODITE, a gridded
rain-gauge based data set for Asia; Yatagai, et al., 2012), coordinated
analyses of regional climate indices and extremes by Climate Variability
and Predictability Programme (CLIVAR)'s Expert Team on Climate Change
Detection and Indices (ETCCD)) (see, e.g., Zhang et al., 2011), and data
rescue work typified by the Atmospheric Circulation Reconstructions
over the Earth (ACRE) initiative (Allan et al., 2011), resulting in analysis
and digitization of many daily or sub-daily weather records from all over
the world. Also, estimates of uncertainty in the observations are either
being directly calculated, for example, for the Hadley Centre/climatic
research unit gridded surface temperature data set 4 (HadCRUTA4) near-
surface temperature record (Morice et al., 2012), or can be generated
from multiple data sets, for example, for precipitation using data sets
such as Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC; Rudolf et al.,
2011), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM; Huffman et al.,
2010), and APHRODITE (Yatagi et al., 2012).

"The importance of establishing an appropriate physical baseline is
illustrated in a study of potential climate change impacts on flow in the
River Thames in the UK over a 126-year period. No long-term trend is
seen in annual maximum flows despite increases in temperature and a
major change in the seasonal partitioning of rainfall, winter rainfall
becoming larger than summer (Marsh, 2004). An investigation of the
physical environment found that it had been significantly modified as part
of river management activities, with increases in channel capacity of 30%
over 70 years leading to fewer floods. Thus establishing a baseline for
river channel capacity explained the current reduced vulnerability of the
Thames to flooding. In a study of the potential for crop adaptation
(Challinor et al., 2009), the relevant non-climatic factor identified was
technological. Detailed field studies demonstrated that the current
germplasm included varieties with a wide range of tolerance to higher
temperatures (Badigannavar et al., 2002). This established an agricultural

potential to reduce vulnerability in the system to compensate for the

"A common perception is that higher resolution (i.e., more spatial detail) equates to more useable and robust
information. Unfortunately data does not equal information, and more high-resolution data does not necessarily
translate to more or better information. Hence, while high-resolution Global Climate Models (GCMs) and many
downscaling methods can provide high-resolution data, and add value in, for example, regions of complex topography,
it is not a given that there will be more value in the final climate change message. This partially depends on how
the higher resolution data were obtained. For example, simple approaches such as spatial interpolation or adding
climate changes from GCMs to observed data fields do increase the spatial resolution but add no new information
on high-resolution climate change. Nonetheless, these data sets are useful for running impacts models. Many impacts
settings are somewhat tuned to a certain resolution, such as the nested size categorizations of hydrologic basins
down to watershed size, commonly used in hydrologic modeling. Using dynamical or statistical downscaling methods
will add a new high-resolution component, providing extra confidence that sub-GCM scale processes are being
represented more accurately. However, there are new errors associated with the additional method applied that
need to be considered. More importantly, if downscaling is applied to only one or two GCMs then the resulting
high-resolution scenarios will not span the full range of projected changes that a large GCM ensemble would
indicate are plausible futures. Spanning that full range is important in being able to properly sample the uncertainty
of the climate as it applies in an impacts context. Thus, for many applications, such as understanding the full envelope
of possible impacts resulting from our current best estimates of regional climate change, lower resolution data
may be more informative. At the end of the day, no one data set is best, and it is through the integration of multiple
sources of information that robust understanding of change is developed. What is important in many climate change
impacts contexts is appropriately sampling the full range of known uncertainties, regardless of spatial resolution.
It is through the integration of multiple sources of information that robust understanding of change is developed.

"Knowledge gap

There is no clear understanding of how to integrate the diversity of climate change projections
data. The full associated uncertainty is weakly characterized and quantifying how much of

an observed or simulated climate change is due to internal variability or external forcings

is difficult in many situations. Collectively this results in data products with differing time

and space resolution and differing dependencies and assumptions that can have conflicting
messages. At present, individual products are plausible and mostly defensible insofar as they
have a physical basis within the assumptions of the method. However, at decision-relevant
scales, understanding where (or whether) the true outcome will lie within the range of

the products collectively is often not possible and thus the products are often not strongly
actionable.

Research need

Research is needed to distinguish the relative stochastic and deterministic sources of
variability and change as a function of scale, variable, and application. The need is to devel
further and build on physical understanding of the drivers of climate variability and change
and to represent these realistically within models to understand the source of the spread a
any contradictions in the regional projections at scales relevant to users, and then to provic
guidance on a likely range of outcomes within which the true response would be expected
to lie. Similarly, there is a need is to articulate the real inherent uncertainty within climate
projection data and to understand when climate information is useful at the scales of need
This also requires stronger dialogues with users of climate information to inform choices of
variables and ways to characterize envelopes of risk and uncertainties.

 

The growth of multi-model, multi-method, and multi-generational data for climate projections
creates confusion for the Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability (IAV) community. The lack of a
clear approach to handling this diversity leads to choosing one or another subset, where one
choice may substantially alter the [AV conclusion compared to a different subset.

Methodological and conceptual advances are needed to facilitate the synthesis of diverse
data sets on different scales from methods with different assumptions, and to integrate the
into cohesive and defensible understanding of projected regional change.

 

The attributes of regional climate change through which impacts are manifest, such as the
intensity, persistence, distribution, recurrence, and frequency of weather events, is poorly
understood. The information conveyed to the adaptation community is dominated by
aggregates in time and space (e.g., IPCC Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme
Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX) regional averages, or
time averages), which hide the important attributes underlying these aggregated changes. In
part this is a consequence of the first row above.

The research need is to be able to demonstrate how to unpack the regional projections intc
terms relevant for impacts and adaptation. For example, how is the shape of the distributio
of weather events changing (not just the extremes), or how stable are the critical global
teleconnection patterns that contribute to the variability of a region?

 

The historical record for many regions, especially those regions most vulnerable to climate
change, is poor to the extent that the historical record is at best an estimate with unknown
uncertainty. This severely undermines the development of regional change analysis, limits
the evaluation of model skill, and presents a weak baseline against which to assess change
signals or to develop impacts, adaptation, or vulnerability baselines.

The research need is to integrate the multiplicity of historical data as represented by the
raw observations into processed gridded products (e.g., climate research unit and Global
Precipitation Climatology Project), satellite data, and reanalysis data sets. Involving natione
scientists with their inherent local knowledge and rescue and digitization of the many
national archives still inaccessible to the wider research community would significantly
enhance this research activity.

 

Impact model sensitivity studies and intercomparison exercises are beginning to reveal
fundamental flaws and omissions in some impact models in the representation of key
processes that are expected to be important under projected climate changes. For example,
high temperature constraints and CO, and drought effects on agricultural yields are poorly
represented in many crop models.

Intensified efforts are needed to refine, test, and intercompare impact models over a

wider range of sectors and environments than hitherto. These should be supported, where
applicable, by targeted field, chamber, and laboratory experiments under controlled
atmospheric composition and climate conditions, to improve understanding of key physical
biological, and chemical processes operating in changed environments. Such experiments a
needed across a range of terrestrial and aquatic biogeographical zones in different regions
the world.

 

New global scenarios are under development, based on climate projections for different
Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and socioeconomic scenarios based on shared
socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). However, there is currently little or no guidance on how these
projections are to be accessed or applied in IAV studies. Moreover, as yet, quantitative SSPs
are available only for large regions (basic SSPs), and regional SSPs that are consistent with
the global SSPs (extended SSPs) along with scenarios that include mitigation and adaptation
policies (shared policy assumptions (SPAs)) have not yet been developed.

Extended SSPs for major subcontinental regions of the world, including variables that defin
aspects of adaptive capacity and guidance on how to combine RCP-based regional climate
projections with regional SSPs and SPAs to form plausible regional scenarios for applicatior
in IAV analysis.

 

The determinants and regional variability of vulnerability, exposure, and adaptive capacity
are not well understood, and methods for projecting changes in them are underdeveloped.
Furthermore, given these lacks of understanding, uncertainties of these three elements are
poorly characterized and quantified.

 

Case studies and underlying theory of these features of societies, and documentation of the
effectiveness of actions taken, are needed in conjunction with methods development for
projections. More attention needs to be placed on determining their uncertainties in nation
and regional assessments.

"	Title
"Evidence of warming over land regions across Africa, consistent with anthropogenic climate change, has increased (high
"	Text
"A reduction in precipitation is /ikely over Northern Africa and the southwestern parts of South Africa by the end of the 21st
century under the SRES A1B and A2 scenarios (medium to high confidence). Projected rainfall change over sub-Saharan Africa in the

mid- and late 21st century is uncertain. In regions of high or complex topography such as the Ethiopian Highlands, downscaled projections
indicate likely increases in rainfall and extreme rainfall by the end of the 21st century. {22.2.2.2, 22.2.3}
"	Text
"African ecosystems are already being affected by climate change, and future impacts are expected to be substantial (high
confidence). There is emerging evidence on shifting ranges of some species and ecosystems due to elevated carbon dioxide (CO,) and climate
change, beyond the effects of land use change and other non-climate stressors (high confidence). Ocean ecosystems, in particular coral reefs,
will be affected by ocean acidification and warming as well as changes in ocean upwellings, thus negatively affecting economic sectors such as
fisheries (medium confidence). {22.3.2, Table 22-3}
"	Text
"Climate change will amplify existing stress on water availability in Africa (high confidence). Water resources are subjected to high
hydro-climatic variability over space and time, and are a key constraint on the continent's continued economic development. The impacts of
climate change will be superimposed onto already water-stressed catchments with complex land uses, engineered water systems, and a strong
historical sociopolitical and economic footprint. Strategies that integrate land and water management, and disaster risk reduction, within a
framework of emerging climate change risks would bolster resilient development in the face of projected impacts of climate change. {22.3.2.2,
22.3.3}
"	Text
"Mean annual temperature rise over Africa, relative to the late 20th century mean annual temperature, is likely to exceed 2°C in
the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B and A2 scenarios by the end of this century (medium confidence). Warming
projections under medium scenarios indicate that extensive areas of Africa will exceed 2°C by the last 2 decades of this century relative to the
late 20th century mean annual temperature and all of Africa under high emission scenarios. Under a high Representative Concentration Pathway
(RCP), that exceedance could occur by mid-century across much of Africa and reach between 3°C and 6°C by the end of the century. It is likely
that land temperatures over Africa will rise faster than the global land average, particularly in the more arid regions, and that the rate of increase
in minimum temperatures will exceed that of maximum temperatures. {22.2.1.2}
"	Text
"Progress has been achieved on managing risks to food production from current climate variability and near-term climate change
but these will not be sufficient to address long-term impacts of climate change (high confidence). Livelihood-based approaches for
managing risks to food production from multiple stressors, including rainfall variability, have increased substantially in Africa since the IPCC’s
Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). While these efforts can improve the resiliency of agricultural systems in Africa over the near term, current
adaptations will be insufficient for managing risks from long-term climate change, which will be variable across regions and farming system
types. Nonetheless, processes such as collaborative, participatory research that includes scientists and farmers, strengthening of communicatior
systems for anticipating and responding to climate risks, and increased flexibility in livelihood options, which serve to strengthen coping
strategies in agriculture for near-term risks from climate variability, provide potential pathways for strengthening adaptive capacities for climate
change. {22.4.5.4, 22.4.5.7, 22.4.6, 22.6.2}

"Conservation agriculture provides a viable means for strengthening resilience in agroecosystems and livelihoods that also advance
adaptation goals (high confidence). A wide array of conservation agriculture practices, including agroforestry and farmer-managed natural
tree regeneration, conservation tillage, contouring and terracing, and mulching, are being increasingly adopted in Africa. These practices
strengthen resilience of the land base to extreme events and broaden sources of livelihoods, both of which have strongly positive implications
for climate risk management and adaptation. Moreover, conservation agriculture has direct adaptation-mitigation co-benefits. Addressing
constraints to broader adoption of these practices, such as land tenure/usufruct stability, access to peer-to-peer learning, gender-oriented
extension and credit and markets, as well as identification of perverse policy incentives, would help to enable larger scale transformation of
agricultural landscapes. {22.4.5.6, 22.4.5.7, 22.4.6, 22.6.2}

"In all regions of the continent, national governments are initiating governance systems for adaptation and responding to climate
change, but evolving institutional frameworks cannot yet effectively coordinate the range of adaptation initiatives being
implemented (high confidence). Progress on national and subnational policies and strategies has initiated the mainstreaming of adaptation
into sectoral planning. {22.4.4} However, incomplete, under-resourced, and fragmented institutional frameworks and overall low levels of
adaptive capacity, especially competency at local government levels, to manage complex socio-ecological change translate into a largely ad
hoc and project-level approach, which is often donor driven. {22.4.2, 22.4.4.3-4} Overall adaptive capacity is considered to be low. {22.4.2}
Disaster risk reduction, social protection, technological and infrastructural adaptation, ecosystem-based approaches, and livelihood diversification

is a multiplier of existing health vulnerabilities (high confidence), including insufficient access to safe water and improved
sanitation, food insecurity, and limited access to health care and education. {22.3.5.1} Detection and attribution of trends is difficult
because of the complexity of disease transmission, with many drivers other than weather and climate, and short and often incomplete data
sets. Evidence is growing that highland areas, especially in East Africa, could experience increased malaria epidemics due to climate change
(medium evidence, very high agreement). The strong seasonality of meningococcal meningitis and associations with weather and climate
variability suggest the disease burden could be negatively affected by climate change (medium evidence, high agreement). The frequency of
leishmaniasis epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa is changing, with spatial spread to peri-urban areas and to adjacent geographic regions, with
possible contributions from changing rainfall patterns (low confidence). Climate change is projected to increase the burden of malnutrition

"Despite implementation limitations, Africa's adaptation experiences nonetheless highlight valuable lessons for enhancing and
scaling up the adaptation response, including principles for good practice and integrated approaches to adaptation (high
confidence). Five common principles for adaptation and building adaptive capacity can be distilled: (1) supporting autonomous adaptation
through a policy that recognizes the multiple-stressor nature of vulnerable livelihoods; (2) increasing attention to the cultural, ethical, and
rights considerations of adaptation by increasing the participation of women, youth, and poor and vulnerable people in adaptation policy and
implementation; (3) combining “soft path” options and flexible and iterative learning approaches with technological and infrastructural
approaches and blending scientific, local, and indigenous knowledge when developing adaptation strategies; (4) focusing on building resilience
and implementing low-regrets adaptation with development synergies, in the face of future climate and socioeconomic uncertainties; and (5)
building adaptive management and social and institutional learning into adaptation processes at all levels. {22.4} Ecosystem-based approaches
and pro-poor integrated adaptation-mitigation initiatives hold promise for a more sustainable and system-oriented approach to adaptation, as
does promoting equity goals, key for future resilience, through emphasizing gender aspects and highly vulnerable groups such as children.

limits to adaptation in Africa (medium confidence). Climate change combined with other external changes (environmental, social, political,
technological) may overwhelm the ability of people to cope and adapt, especially if the root causes of poverty and vulnerability are not addressed.
Evidence is growing for the effectiveness of flexible and diverse development systems that are designed to reduce vulnerability, spread risk, and
build adaptive capacity. These points indicate the benefits of new development trajectories that place climate resilience, ecosystem stability,

climate change impacts in the different sectors; research and improved methodologies to assess and quantify the impact of climate change on

the presence of these and other interconnected causes, including country-specific sociopolitical, economic, and cultural factors. For example, the

while only one key risk assessed can be potentially reduced with high adaptation to below a medium risk level, for the end of

relating to shifts in biome distribution, loss of coral reefs, reduced crop productivity, adverse effects on livestock, vector- and water-borne

existing adaptation deficit. {22.3.1-2, 22.3.4-5, 22.6.1.2} The assessment of significant residual impacts in a 2°C world at the end of the 21st

increase of 4°C, risks for Africa's food security (see key risks on livestock and crop production) are assessed as very high, with limited potential
for risk reduction through adaptation. {22.3.4, 22.4.5, 22.5, Table 22-6}

greater increase in minimum temperature (Vizy and Cook, 2012). The
faster increase in minimum temperature is consistent with greater warming
at night, resulting in a decrease in the future extreme temperature range
(Vizy and Cook, 2012). Higher temperature increases are projected

April-May, June-July-August) an increase in near surface temperature

future as well as a reduction of the number of cold extremes (Seneviratne

"Near surface temperatures have increased by 0.5°C or more during the
last 50 to 100 years over most parts of Africa, with minimum temperatures
warming more rapidly than maximum temperatures (Hulme et al., 2001;

in Africa were significantly higher for the period 1995-2010 compared
to the period 1979-1994 (Collins, 2011). Figure 22-1 shows that it is
very likely that mean annual temperature has increased over the past
century over most of the African continent, with the exception of areas
of the interior of the continent, where the data coverage has been
determined to be insufficient to draw conclusions about temperature
trends (Figure 22-1; Box CC-RC). There is strong evidence of an
anthropogenic signal in continent-wide temperature increases in the

"Temperatures in Africa are projected to rise faster than the global
average increase during the 21st century (Christensen et al., 2007; Joshi
et al., 2011; Sanderson et al., 2011; James and Washington, 2013).
Global average near surface air temperature is projected to move
beyond 20th century simulated variability by 2069 (+18 years) under
Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5) and by 2047 (+14
years) under RCP8.5 (Mora et al., 2013). However, in the tropics, especially
tropical West Africa, these unprecedented climates are projected to occur
1 to 2 decades earlier than the global average because the relatively
small natural climate variability in this region generates narrow climate
bounds that can be easily surpassed by relatively small climate changes.
Figure 22-1 shows projected temperature increases based on the
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) ensemble.
Increases in mean annual temperature over all land areas are very likely
in the mid- and late 21st-century periods for RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 (Figure

exceed 2°C above the late 20th-century baseline over most land areas
of the continent in the mid-21st century for RCP8.5, and exceed 4°C
over most land areas in the late 21st century for RCP8.5. Changes in
mean annual temperature for RCP8.5 follow a pattern of larger changes
in magnitude over northern and southern Africa, with (relatively) smaller
changes in magnitude over central Africa. The ensemble mean changes
are less than 2°C above the late 20th century baseline in both the mid-

and Funk et al. (2008) indicate that over the last 3 decades rainfall has
decreased over eastern Africa between March and May/June. The
suggested physical link to the decrease in rainfall is rapid warming of the
Indian Ocean, which causes an increase in convection and precipitation
over the tropical Indian Ocean and thus contributes to increased
subsidence over eastern Africa and a decrease in rainfall during March
to May/June (Funk et al., 2008; Williams and Funk, 2011). Similarly, Lyon
and DeWitt (2012) show a decline in the March-May seasonal rainfall
over eastern Africa. Summer (June-September) monsoonal precipitation
has declined throughout much of the Great Horn of Africa over the last
60 years (during the 1948-2009 period; Williams et al, 2012) as a result
of the changing sea level pressure (SLP) gradient between Sudan and
the southern coast of the Mediterranean Sea and the southern tropical

"West African precipitation projections in the CMIP3 and CMIP5 archives
show inter-model variation in both the amplitude and direction of

convective rainfall (WGI AR5 Section 14.8.7; Biasutti et al., 2008;
Druyan, 2011; Fontaine et al., 2011; Roehrig et al., 2013). Many CMIP5
models indicate a wetter core rainfall season with a small delay to rainy
season by the end of the 21st century (WGI ARS Section 14.8.7; Biasutti,
2013). However, Regional Climate Models (RCMs) can alter the sign of
rainfall change of the driving GCM, especially in regions of high or
complex topography (WGI ARS Sections 9.6.4, 14.3.7.1; Sylla et al., 2012;
Cook and Vizy, 2013; Saeed et al., 2013). There is therefore Jow to
medium confidence in the robustness of projected regional precipitation
change until a larger body of regional results become available through,
for example, the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment
(CORDEX; Giorgi et al., 2009, Jones et al., 2011, Hewitson et al., 2012).

"Precipitation projections are more uncertain than temperature projections
(Rowell, 2012) and exhibit higher spatial and seasonal dependence than

over the Mediterranean region of northern Africa in the mid- and late
21st century periods for RCP8.5 (Figure 22-1; Box CC-RC). CMIP5 also
projects very likely decreases in mean annual precipitation over areas
of southern Africa beginning in the mid-21st century for RCP8.5 and

Most areas of the African continent do not exhibit changes in mean

66% of the models in either the mid- or late 21st-century periods for

a reversal of historical trend in these months (Funk et al., 2008; Williams
and Funk, 2011). Lyon and DeWitt (2012) ascribe this reversal to recent
cooling in the eastern equatorial Pacific that offsets the equatorial
Pacific SST warming projected by CMIP3 GCMs in future scenarios.
However, GCM projections over Ethiopia indicate a wide range of rainfall
spatial pattern changes (Conway and Schipper, 2011) and in some
regions GCMs do not agree on the direction of precipitation change,
for example, in the upper Blue Nile basin in the late 21st century
(Elshamy et al., 2009). Regional climate model studies suggest drying
over most parts of Uganda, Kenya, and South Sudan in August and
September by the end of the 21st century as a result of a weakening
Somali jet and Indian monsoon (Patricola and Cook, 2011). Cook and Vizy
(2013) indicate truncated boreal spring rains in the mid-21st century
over eastern Ethiopia, Somalia, Tanzania, and southern Kenya while the
boreal fall season is lengthened in the southern Kenya and Tanzania
(Nakaegawa et al., 2012). These regional studies highlight the importance
of resolving both regional scale atmospheric processes and local effects
such as land surface on rainfall simulation across the region (WGI ARS

"Over southern Africa CMIP3 GCM projections show a drying signal in
the annual mean over the climatologically dry southwest, extending
northeastward from the desert areas in Namibia and Botswana (Moise
and Hudson, 2008; Orlowsky and Seneviratne, 2012; James and
Washington, 2013). This pattern is replicated by CMIP5 GCMs (see Figure
22-1). During the austral summer months, dry conditions are projected
in the southwest while downscaled projections indicate wetter conditions
in the southeast of South Africa and the Drakensberg mountain range
(Hewitson and Crane, 2006; Engelbrecht et al., 2009). Consistent with
the AR4, drier winters are projected over a large area in southern Africa
by the end of the century as a result of the poleward displacement of
mid-latitude storm tracks (WGI ARS Section 14.8.7; Moise and Hudson,
2008; Engelbrecht et al., 2009; Shongwe et al., 2009; Seth et al., 2011;
James and Washington, 2013). Rainfall decreases are also projected
during austral spring months, implying a delay in the onset of seasonal
rains over a large part of the summer rainfall region of southern Africa
(Shongwe et al., 2009; Seth et al., 2011). The sign, magnitude, and
spatial extent of projected precipitation changes are dependent on the
Coupled General Circulation Model (CGCM) employed, due primarily to
parameterization schemes used and their interaction with model
dynamics (Hewitson and Crane, 2006; Rocha et al., 2008). Changes in
the parameterization schemes of a single regional climate model
produced opposite rainfall biases over the region (Crétat et al., 2012)
so multiple ensemble downscalings, such as those being produced
through CORDEX, are important to more fully describe the uncertainty
associated with projected rainfall changes across the African continent

Canary current has warmed since the early 1980s, and there is medium
evidence and medium agreement that primary production in the Canary

Changing temperatures in the Canary current has resulted in changes

increasingly suitable for Sardinella aurita) (Section 30.5.5.1.1).
Upwellings are areas of naturally low pH and high CO, concentrations,

impacts (Boxes CC-OA, CC-UP; Section 30.5.5). Warming is projected to
continue in the Canary current, and the synergies between this increase
in water temperature and ocean acidification could influence a number
of biological processes (Section 30.5.5.2). Regarding the Benguela
current upwelling, there is medium agreement despite limited evidence
that the Benguela system will experience changes in upwelling intensity

climate change is estimated to increase water shortages for downstream

strong seasonal component with reduced precipitation in the basin during

"In eastern Africa, potential climate change impacts on the Nile Basin are
of particular concern given the basin’s geopolitical and socioeconomic
importance. Reduced flows in the Blue Nile are estimated by late
century due to a combination of climate change (higher temperatures

irrigation and hydropower (Elshamy et al., 2009; McCartney and Menker
Girma, 2012). Beyene et al. (2010) estimated that streamflow in the
Nile River will increase in the medium term (2010-2039) but will decline
in the latter half of this century (A2 and B1 scenarios) as a result of both
declining rainfall and increased evaporative demand, with subsequent
diminution of water allocation for irrigated agriculture downstream
from the High Aswan Dam. Kingston and Taylor (2010) reached a similar
conclusion about an initial increase followed by a decline in surface
water discharge in the Upper Nile Basin in Uganda. Seasonal runoff

about drivers of future water shortages can mask significant sub-
regional variability of climate impacts, particularly in water-stressed
regions that are projected to become drier, such as northern Africa and
parts of southern Africa. For example, rainfed agriculture in northern Africa
is highly dependent on winter precipitation and would be negatively
impacted if total precipitation and the frequency of wet days decline
across North Africa, as has been indicated in recent studies (Born et al.,
2008; Driouech et al., 2010; Abouabdillah et al., 2010; Garcia-Ruiz et

years do not adequately capture interannual and interdecadal variability
that can positively or negatively influence surface water runoff (Beck and
Bernauer, 2011; Notter et al., 2012; Wolski et al., 2012). Key challenges
for estimating future water abundance in Africa lie in better understanding
relationships among evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and land use

al., 2009). A preliminary analysis by MacDonald et al. (2012) indicates
that total groundwater storage in Africa is 0.66 million km3, which is
“more than 100 times the annual renewable freshwater resources, and
20 times the freshwater stored in African lakes.” However, borehole
yields are variable and in many places water yields are relatively low.
Detailed analysis of groundwater conditions for water resource planning
would need to consider these constraints.

"Climate change is very likely to have an overall negative effect on yields
of major cereal crops across Africa, with strong regional variability in
the degree of yield reduction (see also Section 7.3.2.1) (Liu et al., 2008;
Lobell et al., 2008, 2011; Walker and Schulze, 2008; Thornton et al.,
2009a; Roudier et al., 2011; Berg et al., 2013) (high confidence). One
exception is in eastern Africa where maize production could benefit from
warming at high elevation locations (A1FI scenario) (Thornton et al.,
2009a), although the majority of current maize production occurs at
lower elevations, thereby implying a potential change in the distribution
of maize cropping. Maize-based systems, particularly in southern Africa,
are among the most vulnerable to climate change (Lobell et al., 2008).
Estimated yield losses at mid-century range from 18% for southern
Africa (Zinyengere et al., 2013) to 22% aggregated across sub-Saharan
Africa, with yield losses for South Africa and Zimbabwe in excess of
30% (Schlenker and Lobell, 2010). Simulations that combine all regions
south of the Sahara suggest consistently negative effects of climate
change on major cereal crops in Africa, ranging from 2% for sorghum to
35% for wheat by 2050 under an A2 scenario (Nelson et al., 2009). Studies
in North Africa by Eid et al. (2007), Hegazy et al. (2008), Drine (2011),
and Mougou et al. (2011) also indicate a high vulnerability of wheat
production to projected warming trends. In West Africa, temperature
increases above 2°C (relative to a 1961-1990 baseline) are estimated
to counteract positive effects on millet and sorghum yields of increased
precipitation (for B1,A1B, and A2 scenarios; Figure 22-5), with negative
effects stronger in the savannah than in the Sahel, and with modern
cereal varieties compared with traditional ones (Sultan et al., 2013).

"The extent to which increased heat stress associated with climate
change will affect livestock productivity has not been well established,
particularly in the tropics and subtropics (Thornton et al., 2009b), although
a few studies point to the possibility that keeping heat-tolerant livestock
will become more prevalent in response to warming trends. For example,
higher temperatures in lowland areas of Africa could result in reduced
stocking of dairy cows in favor of cattle (Kabubo-Mariara, 2008), a shift
from cattle to sheep and goats (Kabubo-Mariara, 2008; Seo and
Mendelsohn, 2008), and decreasing reliance on poultry (Seo and
Mendelsohn, 2008). Livestock-keeping in highland areas of east Africa,
which is currently cold-limited, would potentially benefit from increased
temperatures (Thornton et al., 2010). Lunde and Lindtjorn (2013) challenge
a finding in the AR4 that there is direct proportionality between range-
fed livestock numbers and changes in annual precipitation in Africa.
Their analysis indicates that this relationship may hold in dry environments
but not in humid ones.

"Loss of livestock under prolonged drought conditions is a critical risk
given the extensive rangeland in Africa that is prone to drought. Regions
that are projected to become drier with climate change, such as northern
and southern Africa, are of particular concern (Solomon et al., 2007;
Masike and Urich, 2008; Thornton et al., 2009b; Dougill et al., 2010;
Freier et al., 2012; Schilling et al., 2012). Adequate provision of water
for livestock production could become more difficult under climate
change. For example, Masike and Urich (2009) estimated that the cost
of supplying livestock water from boreholes in Botswana will increase
by 23% by 2050 under an A2 scenario due to increased hours of
groundwater pumping needed to meet livestock water demands under
warmer and drier conditions. Although small in comparison to the water
needed for feed production, drinking water provision for livestock is
critical, and can have a strong impact on overall resource use efficiency
in warm environments (Peden et al., 2009; Descheemaeker et al., 2010,
2011; van Breugel et al., 2010). Livestock production will be indirectly
affected by water scarcity through its impact on crop production and
subsequently the availability of crop residues for livestock feeding.

pests in lowland and dryland areas of Africa (low confidence). Under
A2A and B2A for 2020, Cotter et al. (2012) estimated that changes in
temperature, rainfall, and seasonality will result in more suitable habitats
for Striga hermonthica in central Africa, whereas the Sahel region may
become less suitable for this weed. Striga weed infestations are a major
cause of cereal yield reduction in sub-Saharan Africa. Climate change
could also lead to an overall decrease in the suitable range of major
cassava pests—whitefly, cassava brown streak virus, cassava mosaic
geminivirus, and cassava mealybug (Jarvis et al., 2012)—although
southeast Africa and Madagascar are estimated to experience increased
suitability for cassava pests (Bellotti et al, 2012). In the case of livestock,
Olwoch et al. (2008) estimated that the distribution of the main tick
vector species (Rhipicephalus appendiculatus) of East Coast fever disease
in cattle could be altered by a 2°C temperature increase over mean
annual temperatures throughout the 1990s, and changes in mean
precipitation resulting in the climatically suitable range of the tick shifting
southward. However, a number of environmental and socioeconomic
factors (e.g., habitat destruction, land use and cover change, and host
density) in addition to climatic ones influence tick distribution and need
to be considered in assigning causality (Rogers and Randolph, 2006).

"Africa is undergoing rapid urbanization and subsequent transformation
of its food systems to accommodate changes in food processing and
marketing as well as in food consumption patterns. Considering the
increasing reliance on purchased food in urban areas, approaches for
addressing the impacts of climate change on food security will need to
encompass a food systems approach (production as well as processing,
transport, storage, and preparation) that moves food from production
to consumption (Battersby, 2012). Weaknesses in the food system may
be exacerbated by climate change in the region as high temperatures
increase spoilage and the potential for increased flooding places food
transportation infrastructure at higher risk of damage. In this respect, high
post-harvest losses in Africa resulting in a large part from inadequate
transport and storage infrastructure (Godfray et al., 2010; Parfitt et al.,

"Food availability could be threatened through direct climate impacts on crops and livestock from increased flooding,
drought, shifts in the timing and amount of rainfall, and high temperatures, or indirectly through increased soil
erosion from more frequent heavy storms or through increased pest and disease pressure on crops and livestock
caused by warmer temperatures and other changes in climatic conditions. Food access could be threatened by
climate change impacts on productivity in important cereal-producing regions of the world, which, along with
other factors, could raise food prices and erode the ability of the poor in Africa to afford purchased food. Access
is also threatened by extreme events that impair food transport and other food system infrastructure. Climate
change could impact food utilization through increased disease burden that reduces the ability of the human body
to absorb nutrients from food. Warmer and more humid conditions caused by climate change could impact food
availability and utilization through increased risk of spoilage of fresh food and pest and pathogen damage to
stored foods (cereals, pulses, tubers) that reduces both food availability and quality. Stability could be affected by
changes in availability and access that are linked to climatic and other factors.

"Food security in Africa faces multiple threats stemming from entrenched
poverty, environmental degradation, rapid urbanization, high population
growth rates, and climate change and variability. The intertwined issues
of markets and food security have emerged as an important issue in
Africa and elsewhere in the developing world since the AR4. Price spikes
for globally traded food commodities in 2007-2008 and food price
volatility and higher overall food prices in subsequent years have
undercut recent gains in food security across Africa (Brown et al., 2009;
Hadley et al., 2011; Mason et al., 2011; Tawodzera, 2011; Alem and
Séderbom, 2012; Levine, 2012). Among the most affected groups are
the urban poor, who typically allocate more than half of their income
to food purchases (Cohen and Garrett, 2010; Crush and Frayne, 2010).
The proportion of smallholder farmers who are net food buyers of staple
grains exceeds 50% in Mozambique, Kenya, and Ethiopia (Jayne et al.,
2006); thus food security of rural producers is also sensitive to food
spikes, particularly in the case of female-headed households, which
generally have fewer assets than male-headed households (Kumar and
Quisumbing, 2011). Although the recent spike in global food prices can
be attributed to a convergence of several factors, the intensification of
climate change impacts could become more important in the future in
terms of exerting upward pressure on food prices of basic cereals
(Nelson et al., 2009; Hertel et al., 2010), which would have serious
implications for Africa's food security. As the recent wave of food price
crises demonstrates, factors in other regions profoundly impact food
security in Africa. Much more research is needed to understand better

on the A2 scenario. Current baseline prevalence rates of severe stunting
were 12 to 20%. Considering only future socioeconomic change, the
prevalence of severe stunting in 2050 would be 7 to 17% (e.g., a net
decline). However, including climate change, the prevalence of severe
stunting would be 9 to 22%, or an increase of 31 to 55% in the relative
percent of children severely stunted. Western sub-Saharan Africa was
projected to experience a decline in severe stunting from 16% at
present to 9% in 2050 when considering socioeconomic and climate
change. Projected changes for central, south, and east sub-Saharan Africa
are close to current prevalence rates, indicating climate change would
counteract the beneficial consequences of socioeconomic development.

"Weather and climate are among the environmental, social, and economic
determinants of the geographic range and incidence of malaria (Reiter,

(Chaves and Koenraadt, 2010; Paaijmans et al., 2010a; Alonso et al.,
2011; Gilioli and Mariani, 2011). Malaria transmission peaks at 25°C
and declines above 28°C (Lunde et al., 2013; Mordecai et al., 2013).
Total precipitation, rainfall patterns, temperature variability, and the
water temperature of breeding sites are expected to alter disease
susceptibility (Bomblies and Eltahir, 2010; Paaijmans et al., 2010b;
Afrane et al., 2012; Blanford et al., 2013; Lyons et al., 2013). ENSO
events also may contribute to malaria epidemics (Mabaso et al., 2007;
Ototo et al., 2011). The complexity of the malaria transmission cycle
makes it difficult to determine whether the distribution of the pathogen
and vector are already changing due to climate change. Other factors
such as the Indian Ocean Dipole have been proposed to affect malaria
incidence (Hashizume et al., 2009; Chaves et al., 2012; Hashizume et

suggesting possible changes in incidence and geographic range with
climate change (Rod6 et al., 2002; Koelle et al., 2005; Olago et al., 2007;
Murray et al., 2012). The frequency and duration of cholera outbreaks
are associated with heavy rainfall in Ghana, Senegal, other coastal West
African countries, and South Africa, with a possible association with the
El Nifio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (de Magny et al., 2007, 2012;
Mendelsohn and Dawson, 2008). In Zanzibar, Tanzania, and Zambia, an
increase in temperature or rainfall increases the number of cholera
cases (Luque Fernandez et al., 2009; Reyburn et al., 2011). The worst
outbreak of cholera in recent African history occurred in Zimbabwe
from August 2008 to June 2009. The epidemic was associated with the
rainy season and caused more than 92,000 cases and 4000 deaths.
Contamination of water sources spread the disease (Mason, 2009). Poor
governance, poor infrastructure, limited human resources, and underlying
population susceptibility (high burden of malnutrition) contributed to
the severity and extent of the outbreak (Murray et al., 2012). Other
mechanisms for increases in cholera incidence are described in Section
11.5.2.1. As discussed in Section 22.2 there are projected increases in
precipitation in areas in Africa, for example West Africa where cholera
is already endemic. This possibly will lead to more frequent cholera
outbreaks in the sub-regions affected. However, further research is needed
to quantify the climatic impacts.

showing that RVF epizootics and epidemics are closely linked to the
occurrence of the warm phase of ENSO and La Nifia events (Linthicum et

These conditions lead to heavy rainfall and flooding of habitats suitable
for the production of the immature Aedes and Culex mosquitoes that serve
as the primary RVF virus vectors in East Africa. Flooding of mosquito
habitats also may introduce the virus into domestic animal populations.

"Directly or indirectly, climate change may increase the incidence and
geographic range of leishmaniasis, a highly neglected disease that has
recently become a significant health problem in northern Africa (Postigo,
2010), with a rising concern in western Africa because of coinfection

to be changing (Dondji, 2001; Yiougo et al., 2007; WHO, 2009; Postigo,

emerged as an epidemic disease in Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia, and
is now endemic (Salah et al., 2007; Aoun et al., 2008; Rhajaoui, 2011;
Toumi et al., 2012; Bounoua et al., 2013). Previously an urban disease
in Algeria, leishmaniasis now has a peri-urban distribution linked to
changes in the distribution of the rodent host and of the vector since
the early 1990s (Aoun et al., 2008). Cutaneous leishmaniasis has
expanded its range from its historical focus at Biskra, Algeria, into the
semi-arid steppe, with an associated upward trend in reported cases.
In Morocco, sporadic cases of leishmania major (vector Phlebotomus
papatasi) appeared early in the 21st century; since that time there have
been occasional epidemics of up to 2000 cases, interspersed with long
periods with few or no cases (Rhajaoui, 2011). Outbreaks of zoonotic
cutaneous leishmaniasis have become more frequent in Tunisia (where
it emerged as an epidemic disease in 1991) (Salah et al., 2007; Toumi

"There is a strong environmental relationship between the seasonal cycle
of meningococcal meningitis and climate, including a relationship
between the seasonal pattern of the Harmattan dusty winds and onset
of disease. Transmission of meningitis occurs throughout Africa in the
dry season and coincides with periods of very low humidity and wind-
driven dusty conditions, ending with the onset of the rains (Molesworth
et al., 2003). Research corroborates earlier hypothesized relationships
between weather and meningitis (Yaka et al., 2008; Palmgren, 2009;
Roberts, 2010; Dukic¢ et al., 2012; Agier et al., 2013). In the northern
region of Ghana, exposure to smoke from cooking fires increased the
tisk of contracting meningococcal meningitis (Hodgson et al., 2001).
This increased risk suggests that exposure to elevated concentrations
of air pollutants, such as carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter,
may be linked to illness. More research is needed to clarify the possible
impact of climate change on atmospheric concentrations of aerosols
and particulates that can impact human health and any associations
between meningitis and these aerosols and particles. The relationship
between the environment and the location of the epidemics suggest
connections between epidemics and regional climate variability
(Molesworth et al., 2003; Sultan et al., 2005; Thomson et al., 2006),

from extreme events have also been made for some coastal cities,
including Mombasa and Dar-es-Salaam. In Mombasa, by 2030 the
population and assets at risk of 1-in-100-year return period extreme water
levels is estimated to be between 170,700 and 266,300 inhabitants, while
economic assets at risk are between US$0.68 billion and US$1.06 billion

Lessons learned

Security of tenure over land and
resource access is critical for enabling
enhanced adaptive capacity of women
(ADF, 2010).

Research on understanding different
adaptive strategies of benefit for
women and men is needed.

 

Child-centered
approaches to
adaptation

50% of Africa's population is under the
age of 20 years (UN DESA Population
Division, 2011), yet their issues are
largely absent from adaptation policy
(ADF, 2010).

Children’s differential vulnerability
to projected climate impacts is high,
particularly to hunger, malnutrition,
and disasters (UNICEF, 2007).

Limits to children’s agency related to
power imbalances between children
and adults, and different cultural
contexts (Seballos et al., 2011)

Using approaches that stress agency
and empowerment, and “innovative
energies” of youth; build on targeted
adaptation initiatives, such as child-
centered disaster risk reduction and
adaptation (ADF, 2010; Seballos et
al., 2011)

Positive role of children and youth as
change agents for climate adaptation,
within appropriate enabling
environment

Child-sensitive programs and policies
can reduce risks children face from
disasters (Seballos et al, 2011).

Funding for climate resilience
programs will protect children’s basic
rights (UNICEF, 2010, 2011).

 

Human rights—based
approaches (HRBA)

 

Common critical rights issues for local
communities are land/resource rights,
gender equality, and political voice
and fair adjudication of grievances
for the poor and excluded (Castro et
al., 2012).

 

Lack of recognition and promotion of
their human rights blocks indigenous
peoples’ coping and adaptation
capacities (UNPFIl, 2008).

 

Using the HRBA lens to understand
climate risk necessitates risk analysis
to probe the root causes of differential
disaster risk vulnerabilities, to enable
structural, sustainable responses
(Urquhart, 2013).

 

Applying HRBA presents a framework
for addressing conflicting rights

and interests, necessary for building
resilience and equitable adaptation
responses (SIDA, 2010).

African Forests (COMIFAC), present an opportunity to strengthen the
institutional framework for adaptation. National frameworks include a

countries have interministerial coordinating bodies and intersectoral
technical working groups, while an increasing number now have multi-

"Many studies in Africa show that under uncertain climatic futures,
replacing hierarchical governance systems that operate within siloes
with more adaptive, integrated, multilevel, and flexible governance
approaches, and with inclusive decision making that can operate
successfully across multiple scales—or adaptive governance and co-
management—will enhance adaptive capacity and the effectivess of
the adaptation response (Folke et al., 2005; Olsson et al., 2006; Koch
et al., 2007; Berkes, 2009; Pahl-Wostl, 2009; Armitage and Plummer,
2010; Bunce et al., 2010a; Plummer, 2012). Despite some progress with
developing the institutional framework for governing adaptation, there
are significant problems with both transversal and vertical coordination,
including institutional duplication with other intersectoral platforms,
such as disaster risk reduction; while in fragile states, institutions for
reducing climate risk and promoting adaptation may be extremely weak
or almost nonexistent (Hartmann and Sugulle, 2009; Sietz et al., 2011;
Simane et al., 2012). Facilitating institutional linkages and coordinating
responses across all boundaries of government, private sector, and civil
society would enhance adaptive capacity (Brown et al., 2010). Resolving
well-documented institutional challenges of natural resource management,
including lack of coordination, monitoring, and enforcement, is a
fundamental step toward more effective climate governance. For
example, concerning groundwater, developing organizational frameworks
and strengthening institutional capacities for more effectively assessing
and managing groundwater resources over the long term are critically
important (Nyenje and Batelaan, 2009; Braune and Xu, 2010).

"Emerging patterns in Africa regarding adaptation decision making, a
critical component of adaptive capacity, include limited inclusive
governance at the national level, with greater involvement in local

adaptation policies and strategies, highlighting the need for governments
to widen the political space for citizens and institutions to participate
in decision making, for both effectiveness and to ensure rights are met

for climate change may assist with this (CCAA, 2011; Chandani, 2011;
Corsi et al., 2012). A critical issue is how planning and decision making

priorities for pro-poor adaptation: social protection, social services, and
safety nets; better water and land governance; action research to improve
resilience of under-researched food crops of poor people; enhanced water
storage and harvesting; better post-harvest services; strengthened civil

positive: 892 farmers purchased the insurance in the first trial period, which was bundled with a loan for groundnut production inputs

stimulating interest among banks, financiers, and supply chain participants such as processing and trading companies and input

time window between observed lack of rain and actual materialization of losses. This allows stakeholders to address threats to food
security in ways that prevent the depletion of farmers’ productive assets, which reduces the future demand for humanitarian aid by
enabling households to produce more food during subsequent seasons (Krishnamurty, 2011). Another key innovation in Ethiopia is
the insurance for work program that allows cash-poor farmers to work for their insurance premiums by engaging in community-

"Recent literature has confirmed the positive role of local and traditional
knowledge in building resilience and adaptive capacity, and shaping
responses to climatic variability and change in Africa (Nyong et al., 2007;
Osbahr et al., 2007; Goulden et al., 2009b; Ifejika Speranza et al., 2010;
Jalloh et al., 2011b; Newsham and Thomas, 2011). This is particularly
so at the community scale, where there may be limited access to, quality
of, or ability to use scientific information. The recent report on extreme
events and disasters (IPCC, 2012) supports this view, finding robust
evidence and high agreement of the positive impacts of integrating
indigenous and scientific knowledge for adaptation. Concerns about
the future adequacy of local knowledge to respond to climate impacts
within the multi-stressor context include the decline in intergenerational
transmission; a perceived decline in the reliability of local indicators for
variability and change, as a result of sociocultural, environmental, and
climate changes (Hitchcock 2009; Jennings and Magrath 2009); and
challenges of the emerging and anticipated climatic changes seeming
to overrun indigenous knowledge and coping mechanisms of farmers

droughts during the 1970s and 1980s, Mortimore (2010) argues that
local knowledge systems are more dynamic and robust than is often
acknowledged. Linking indigenous and conventional climate observations
can add value to climate change adaptation within different local
communities in Africa (Roncoli et al., 2002; Nyong et al., 2007; Chang’a

into more productive, sustainable, and resilient systems by integrating trees into annual cropping systems. For example, in Zambia
and Malawi, an integrated strategy for replenishing soil fertility on degraded lands, which combines planting of nitrogen-fixing
Faidherbia trees with small doses of mineral fertilizers, has consistently more than doubled yields of maize leading to increased foo
security and greater income generation (Garrity et al., 2010). In the Sahel, natural regeneration, or the traditional selection and
protection of small trees to maturity by farmers and herders has, perhaps for centuries, produced extensive parks of Acacia albida
(winter thorn) in Senegal (Lericollais, 1989), Adansonia digitata (baobab) in West and southern Africa (Sanchez et al., 2011), and
Butyrospermum parkii (shea butter) in Burkina Faso (Gijsbers et al., 1994). Recent natural regeneration efforts have increased tree

adoption and success is somewhat dependent on soil type (Haglund et al., 2011; Larwanou and Saadou, 2011). In southern Niger,
farmer-managed natural regeneration of Faidherbia albida and other field trees, which began in earnest in the late 1980s, has led tc

adoption (Mertz et al., 2009; Nielsen and Reenberg, 2010). While
destocking of livestock during drought periods may also address
desertification and adaptation, the lack of individual incentives and
marketing mechanisms to destock and other cultural barriers inhibit
their widespread adoption in the Sahel (Hein et al., 2009; Nielsen and

CBNRM is also a vehicle for improving links between ecosystem services

The short-term nature of policy and other interventions, especially if
they favor economic growth and modernization over resilience and

react only to short-term climate variability (Brooks et al., 2009; Bryan

for instance, Smucker and Wisner (2008) found that political and economic
changes in Kenya meant that farmers could no longer use traditional
strategies for coping with climatic shocks and stressors, with the poorest
increasingly having to resort to coping strategies that undermined their
long-term livelihood security, also known as erosive coping, such as
more intensive grazing of livestock and shorter crop rotations (van der
Geest and Dietz, 2004). In a case from the Simiyu wetlands in Tanzania,
Hamisi et al. (2012) find that coping and reactive adaptation strategies

Examples of adaptation actions for road and transportation infrastructure

development can be achieved at low cost, as has been shown for flood-

climate change considerations into infrastructure at the design stage is
preferable from a cost and feasibility perspective than trying to retrofit

building codes and zone planning are being implemented and are
needed to complement and/or provide strategic guidance for hard
infrastructural climate proofing, for example, the adoption of cyclone-

literature and expert judgments made by authors of the various WGII ARS chapters, with supporting evaluation of evidence and agreement in the referenced chapter sections.
Each key risk is characterized as very ow, low, medium, high, or very high. Risk levels are presented for the near-term era of committed climate change (here, for 2030-2040), in
which projected levels of global mean temperature increase do not diverge substantially across emissions scenarios. Risk levels are also presented for the longer term era of
climate options (here, for 2080-2100), for global mean temperature increase of 2°C and 4°C above pre-industrial levels. For each time frame, risk levels are estimated for the
current state of adaptation and for a hypothetical highly adapted state. As the assessment considers potential impacts on different physical, biological, and human systems, risk
levels should not necessarily be used to evaluate relative risk across key risks. Relevant climate variables are indicated by symbols.

"Although the significance of human security cannot be overestimated,
the evidence of the impact of climate change on human security in
Africa is disputable (see Chapters 12 and 19). Adverse climate events
potentially impact all aspects of human security, either directly or indirectly
(on mapping climate security vulnerability in Africa see Busby et al., 2013).
Food security, water stress, land use, health security, violent conflict,
changing migration patterns, and human settlements are all interrelated
issues with overlapping climate change and human security dimensions.

"These findings highlight the benefits of transformational change in
situations where high levels of vulnerability and low adaptive capacity
detract from the possibility for systems to adapt sustainably. This is in
agreement with the Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme
Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation, which
additionally found robust evidence and high agreement for the
importance of a spectrum of actions ranging from incremental steps to
transformational changes in order to reduce climate risks (IPCC, 2012).
In support of such solutions, Moench (2011) has called for distilling
common principles for building adaptive capacity at different stages,
and adaptive management and learning are seen as critical approaches
for facilitating transformation (IPCC, 2012; see also Section 22.4.5.3).
Chapter 16 provides further discussion on how encountering limits to
adaptation may trigger transformational change, which can be a means
of adapting to hard limits.

"indigenous knowledge, as well as erosion of traditional knowledge, to
the extent that it is difficult or no longer possible to respond to climate
variability and risk in ways that people did in the past (Dabi et al., 2008;
Leary et al., 2008b; Paavola, 2008; Smucker and Wisner, 2008; Clover

2010b; Quinn et al., 2011; Jones, 2012; see also Section 22.4.5.4). As
a result of these multiple stressors working together, the number of
response options has decreased and traditional coping strategies are
no longer sufficient (Dube and Sekhwela, 2008). Studies have shown
that most autonomous adaptation usually involves minor adjustments
to current practices (e.g., changes in planting decisions); there are simply
too many barriers to implementing substantial changes that require
investment (e.g., agroforestry and irrigation) (Bryan et al., 2011). Such
adaptation strategies would be enhanced through government and
private sector/NGO support, without which many poor groups in Africa
may face real limits to adaptation (Vincent et al., 2011a; Jones, 2012).
"	Text
"As indicated in Table 22-6, seven of the nine key regional risks are
assessed for the present as being either medium or high under current
adaptation levels, reflecting both the severity of multiple relevant
stressors and Africa's existing adaptation deficit. This is the case for risks
relating to shifts in biome distribution (Section 22.3.2.1), degradation
of coral reefs (Section 22.3.2.3), reduced crop productivity (Section
22.3.4.1), adverse effects on livestock (Section 22.3.4.2), vector- and
water-borne diseases (Sections 22.3.5.2, 22.3.5.4), undernutrition
(Section 22.3.5.3), and migration (Section 22.6.1.2). This assessment
indicates that allowing current emissions levels to result in a +4°C
world (above preindustrial levels) by the 2080-2100 period would have
negative impacts on Africa's food security, as even under high adaptation
levels, risks of reduced crop productivity and adverse effects on livestock
are assessed as remaining very high. Moreover, our assessment is that
even if high levels of adaptation were achieved, risks of stress on water
resources (Section 22.3.3), degradation of coral reefs (Section 22.3.2.3),
and the destructive effects of SLR and extreme weather events (Section
22.3.6) would remain high. However, even under a lower emissions
scenario leading to a long-term 2°C warming, all nine key regional risks
are assessed as remaining high or very high under current levels of
adaptation. The assessment indicates that even under high adaptation,
residual impacts in a 2°C world would be significant, with only risk
associated with migration rated as being capable of reduction to low
under high levels of adaptation. High adaptation would be enabled by
concerted effort and substantial funding; even if this is realized, no risk
is assessed as being capable of reduction to below medium status.

"Human migration has social, political, demographic, economic, and
environmental drivers, which may operate independently or in combination
(for more in-depth discussions, see Sections 12.4 and 19.4.2.1; Perch-
Nielsen et al., 2008; Piguet, 2010; Black et al., 2011a; Foresight, 2011;
Piguet et al., 2011; Van der Geest, 2011). Many of these drivers are climate
sensitive (Black et al., 2011; see also Section 12.4.1). People migrate
either temporarily or permanently, within their country or across borders
(Section 12.4.1.2; Figure 12-1; Table 12-3; Warner et al., 2010; Kalin and
Schrepfer, 2012). The evidence base in the field of migration in Africa is
both varied and patchy. Evidence suggests that migration is a strategy
to adapt to climate change (Section 12.4.2). Mobility is indeed a strategy
(not a reaction) to high levels of climatic variation that is characteristic
of Africa (Tacoli, 2011) and the specifics of the response are determined
by the economic context of the specific communities.

"Wide consensus exists that violent conflicts are
based on a variety of interconnected causes, of
which the environment is considered to be one,
but rarely the most decisive factor. Whether the
changing climate increases the risk of civil war in
Africa remains disputed and little robust research
is available to resolve this question. Climate change
impacts that intensify competition for increasingly
scarce resources such as freshwater and arable
land, especially in the context of population growth,
are areas of concern. The degradation of natural
resources as a result of both overexploitation and
climate change will contribute to increased conflicts
over the distribution of these resources. In addition
to these stressors, however, the outbreak of armed
conflict depends on many country-specific socio-
political, economic, and cultural factors.

"Besides low-lying islands and coastal and deltaic regions in general,
sub-Saharan Africa is one of the regions that would particularly be
affected by environmentally induced migration (Gemenne, 201 1a). Case
studies from Somalia and Burundi emphasize the interaction of climate
change, disaster, conflict, displacement, and migration (Kolmannskog,
2010). In Ghana, for example, an African country with few conflicts
caused by political, ethnic, or religious tensions, and thus with migration
drivers more likely related to economic and environmental motivators
(Tschakert and Tutu, 2010), some different types of migration flows are
considered to have different sensitivity to climate change (Black et al.,
201 1a). The floods of the Zambezi River in Mozambique in 2008 have
displaced 90,000 people, and it has been observed that along the
Zambezi River Valley, with approximately 1 million people living in
the flood-affected areas, temporary mass displacement is taking on
permanent characteristics (Jager et al., 2009; Warner et al., 2010).

"Different assessments of future trends have recently produced
contradictory conclusions (e.g., UN-OCHA and IDMC, 2009; Naude,
2010; ADB, 2011; IDMC, 2011; Tacoli, 2011). One approach in assessing
future migration potentials, with considerable relevance to the African
context, focused on capturing the net effect of environmental change on
aggregate migration through analysis of both its interactions with other
migration drivers and the role of migration within adaptation strategies,
rather than identifying specific groups as potential ‘environmental
migrants’ (Foresight, 2011). Even if Africa's population doubles by 2050
to 2 billion (Lutz and K.C., 2010) and the potential for displacement
rises as a consequence of the impact of extreme weather events, recent
analyses (Black et al., 2011b; Foresight, 2011) show that the picture for
future migration is much more complex than previous assessments of a
rise in climate-induced migration suggest, and relates to the intersection
of multiple drivers with rates of global growth, levels of governance,
and climate change.

"While there seems to be consensus that the environment is only one of
several interconnected causes of conflict and is rarely considered to be
the most decisive factor (Kolmannskog, 2010), it remains disputed
whether, and if so, how, the changing climate directly increases the risk
of violent conflict in Africa (for more detail, see Chapters 12 and 19, in
particular Sections 12.5.1, 19.4; Gleditsch, 2012). However, views are
emerging that there is a positive relationship between increases in
temperature and increases in human conflict (Hsiang et al., 2013). Some
of the factors which may increase the risk of violent conflict, such as
low per capita incomes, economic contraction, and inconsistent state
institutions are sensitive to climate change (Section 12.5.1). For the
African Sahel States it has been argued that the propensity for communal
conflict across ethnic groups within Africa is influenced by political and
economic vulnerability to climate change (Raleigh, 2010). Evidence on
the question of whether, and if so, to what extent, climate change and
variability increases the risk of civil war in Africa is contested (Burke et
al., 2009b; Buhaug, 2010; Devitt and Tol, 2012). It has been suggested
that due to the depletion of natural resources in Africa as a result of
overexploitation and the impact of climate change on environmental
degradation, competition for scarce resources could increase and lead
to violent conflict (Kumssa and Jones, 2010). For East Africa it has been
suggested that increased levels of malnutrition are related to armed
conflicts (Rowhani et al., 2011). There is some agreement that rainfall

farmers and local communities in carbon offset systems, increasing the
use of relevant technologies such as agroforestry and farmer-assisted
tree regeneration (Section 22.4.5.6), and emerging Green Economy
policy responses. The recognition that adaptation and mitigation are
complementary elements of the global response to climate change, and
not trade-offs, is gaining traction in Africa (Goklany, 2007; Nyong et al.,

"Better agronomic characterization of biofuel crops is another key
knowledge gap. For example, little information exists with respect to
the agronomic characteristics of the oilseed crop Jatropha (V/atropha

environments, despite the fact that Jatropha has been widely touted as
an appropriate feedstock for biofuel production in Africa because of its
ability to grow in a wide range of climates and soils. Oilseed yields of
Jatropha can be highly variable, and even basic information about
yield potential and water and fertilizer requirements for producing
economically significant oilseed yields is scanty (Achten et al., 2008;

"While the suitability of on- and off-farm techniques for an integrated
adaptation-mitigation response depends on local physical conditions as

natural regeneration; and conservation agriculture (Woodfine, 2009;
Milder et al., 2011; Mutonyi and Fungo, 2011; see also Section 22.4.5.6;
Box 22-2). An emerging area is multiple-benefit initiatives that aim to
reduce poverty, promote adaptation through restoring local ecosystems,
and deliver benefits from carbon markets. Brown et al. (2011) note the
example of a community-based project in Humbo, Ethiopia, which is
facilitating adaptation and generating temporary certified emissions

"The potential for first-generation biofuel production in Africa, derived
from bioethanol from starch sources and biodiesel production from
oilseeds, is significant given the continent's extensive arable lands, labor
availability, and favorable climate for biofuel crop production (Amigun et
al., 2011; Arndt et al., 2011; Hanff et al, 2011). While biofuel production
has positive energy security and economic growth implications, the
prospect of wide-scale biofuel production in Africa carries with it
significant risks related to environmental and social sustainability.
Among the concerns are competition for land and water between fuel
and food crops, adverse impacts of biofuels on biodiversity and the
environment, contractual and regulatory obligations that expose farmers
to legal risks, changes in land tenure security, and reduced livelihood
opportunities for women, pastoralists, and migrant farmers who depend
on access to the land resource base (Unruh, 2008; Amigun et al., 2011;

"The literature highlights the desirability of responding to climate
change through integrated adaptation-mitigation approaches, including
through spatial planning, in the implementation of REDD+ in Africa,

Guariguata et al., 2008; Nasi et al., 2008; Biesbroek et al, 2009; Somorin
et al., 2012). However, forests are mainly used for reactive coping and
not anticipatory adaptation; studies show that governments favor
mitigation while local communities prioritize adaptation (Fisher et al.,
2010; Somorin et al., 2012). Flexible REDD+ models that include
agriculture and adaptation hold promise for generating co-benefits for
poverty reduction, given food security and adaptation priorities, and
help to avoid trade-offs between REDD+ implementation and adaptive
capacities of communities, ecosystems, and nations (Nkem et al.,

"More research is needed to understand fully the socioeconomic and
environmental trade-offs associated with biofuel production in Africa.
One critical knowledge gap concerns the effect of biofuel production,
particularly large-scale schemes, on land use change and subsequent
food and livelihood security. For example, the conversion of marginal
lands to biofuel crop production would impact the ability of users of
these lands (pastoralists and in some cases women who are allocated
marginal land for food and medicinal production) to participate in land
use and food production decisions (Amigun et al., 2011; Schoneveld et
al., 2011). In addition, biofuel production could potentially lead to the
extension of agriculture into forested areas, either directly through
conversion of fallow vegetation or the opening of mature woodland, or
indirectly through use of these lands to offset food crop displacement
(German et al., 2011). Such land use conversion would result in
biofuel production reducing terrestrial carbon storage potential (Vang
Rasmussen et al., 2012a,b).

technological support needed to both address Africa's current adaptation
deficit and to protect rural and urban livelihoods, societies, and economies
from climate change impacts at different local scales, with estimates of
adaptation costs between US$20 and US$30 billion per annum over the
next couple of decades, up to US$60 billion per annum by 2030 (Parry
et al, 2009b; Fankhauser and Schmidt-Traub, 2010; Watkiss et al, 2010;
AfDB, 2011; Dodman and Carmin, 2011; LDC Expert Group, 2011; Smith
et al., 2011; e.g., see Figure 22-6). However, these figures are likely to
be underestimates, as studies upon which these estimates are based do
not always include the costs of overcoming Africa's current adaptation
deficit, may be run for one scenario at a time, and do not factor in a
range of uncertainties in the planning environment.

"In line with increasing international impetus for adaptation (Persson et
al., 2009), the Parties to the UNFCCC agreed on providing “adequate,
predictable and sustainable financial resources” for adaptation in
developing countries, and, within this context, paid special attention to
Africa which is “particularly vulnerable” to the adverse effects of climate
change (UNFCCC, 2009, 2011; Berenter, 2012). Doubts remain about
how private sector financing can be effectively mobilized and channeled
toward adaptation in developing countries (Atteridge, 2011; Naidoo et
al., 2012). The 2012 Landscape of Climate Finance Report (Buchner et
al., 2012) stated that mitigation activities attracted US$350 billion,
mostly related to renewable energy and energy efficiency, while
adaptation activities attracted US$14 billion. Approximately 30% of the
global distributed adaptation finance went to Africa (Nakhooda et al.,
2011) and seems to prioritize the continent (Naidoo et al., 2012).

"Effective adaptation requires more than sufficient levels of funding. It
requires developing country “readiness,” which includes abilities to plan
and access finances; the capacity to deliver adaptation projects and
programs, and to monitor, report, and evaluate their effectiveness
(Vandeweerd et al., 2012); and also a regulatory framework, which
guarantees, for example, property rights (WGIII ARS Chapter 16).
Particularly serious challenges are associated with directing finance to

Research in climate and climate impacts would be greatly enhanced if data custodians and researchers worked together to use observed station data in scientific
studies. Research into regional climate change and climate impacts relies on observed climate and hydrological data as an evaluative base. These data are most often
recorded by meteorological institutions in each country and sold to support data collection efforts. However, African researchers are generally excluded from access to
these critical data because of the high costs involved, which hinders both climate and climate impacts research.

© Downscaling General Circulation Model (GCM) data to the regional scale captures the influence of topography on the regional climate. Regional climate information is
essential for understanding regional climate processes, regional impacts, and potential future changes in these. In addition, impacts models such as hydrology and crop
models generally require input data at a resolution higher than what GCMs can provide. Regional downscaling, either statistically or through use of regional climate
models, can provide information at these scales and can also change the sign of GCM-projected rainfall change over topographically complex areas (Section 2.2.2.2).

"The provision of ecosystem services is projected to decline across all service categories in response to climate change in Southern
Europe (high confidence). {23.9.1; Box 23-1} Both gains and losses in the provision of ecosystem services are projected for the other

European sub-regions (high confidence), but the provision of cultural services is projected to decline in the Continental, Northern, and Southern
sub-regions (/ow confidence). {Box 23-1}
"	Text
"Climate change is expected to impede economic activity in Southern Europe more than in other sub-regions (medium confidence
{23.9.1; Table 23-4}, and may increase future intra-regional disparity (low confidence). {23.9.1} There are also important differences
in vulnerability within sub-regions; for example, plant species and some economic sectors are most vulnerable in high mountain areas due to
lack of adaptation options (medium confidence). {23.9.1} Southern Europe is particularly vulnerable to climate change (high confidence),

as multiple sectors will be adversely affected (tourism, agriculture, forestry, infrastructure, energy, population health) (high confidence).

{23.9; Table 23-4}

"Observed climate trends and future climate projections show regionally varying changes in temperature and rainfall in Europe
(high confidence), {23.2.2} in agreement with Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) findings, with projected increases in temperature throughout
Europe and increasing precipitation in Northern Europe and decreasing precipitation in Southern Europe. {23.2.2.2} Climate projections show a
marked increase in high temperature extremes (high confidence), meteorological droughts (medium confidence), {23.2.3} and heavy precipitation
events (high confidence), {23.2.2.3} with variations across Europe, and small or no changes in wind speed extremes (/ow confidence) except
increases in winter wind speed extremes over Central and Northern Europe (medium confidence). {23.2.2.3}

"Climate change will increase the likelihood of systemic failures across European countries caused by extreme climate events
affecting multiple sectors (medium confidence). {23.2.2.3, 23.2.3, 23.3-6, 23.9.1} Extreme weather events currently have significant
impacts in Europe in multiple economic sectors as well as adverse social and health effects (high confidence). {Table 23-1} There is limited evidenc
that resilience to heat waves and fires has improved in Europe (medium confidence), {23.9.1, 23.5} while some countries have improved their
flood protection following major flood events. {23.9.1, 23.7.3} Climate change is very likely to increase the frequency and intensity of heat
waves, particularly in Southern Europe (high confidence), {23.2.2} with mostly adverse implications for health, agriculture, forestry, energy
production and use, transport, tourism, labor productivity, and the built environment. {23.3.2-4, 23.3.6, 23.4.1-4, 23.5.1; Table 23-1}

"limate change will increase irrigation needs (high confidence) but future irrigation will be constrained by reduced runoff,
lemand from other sectors, and by economic costs. {23.4.1, 23.4.3} By the 2050s, irrigation will not be sufficient to prevent damage
fom heat waves to crops in some sub-regions (medium confidence). System costs will increase under all climate scenarios (high confidence).
23.4.3} Integrated management of water, also across countries’ boundaries, is needed to address future competing demands among agriculture,

"Climate change is projected to affect the impacts of hot and cold weather extremes on transport leading to economic damage
and/or adaptation costs, as well as some benefits (e.g., reduction of maintenance costs) during winter (medium confidence).
{23.3.3} Climate change is projected to reduce severe accidents in road transport (medium confidence) and adversely affect inland water
transport in summer in some rivers (e.g., the Rhine) after 2050 (medium confidence). Damages to rail infrastructure from high temperatures
may also increase (medium confidence). Adaptation through maintenance and operational measures can reduce adverse impacts to some

extent.

"Sea level rise and increases in extreme rainfall are projected to further increase coastal and river flood risk in Europe and,
without adaptive measures, will substantially increase flood damages (people affected and economic losses) (high confidence).
{23.3.1, 23.5.1} Adaptation can prevent most of the projected damages (high confidence, based on medium evidence, high agreement) but

be identified. Further, the cross-sectoral decision making required to
address climate change can be reviewed. The chapter also includes
sections that were not in AR4. As adaptation and mitigation policy
develops, the evidence for potential co-benefits and unintended
consequences of such strategies is reviewed (Section 23.8). The final
section synthesizes the key findings with respect to: observed impacts

"Adaptation policies and practices have been developed at international,
national, and local levels although research on implementation of such

adaptation in relation to cross-sectoral decision making is discussed in
Section 23.7 (see also Box 23-3 on national adaptation policies). The
European Climate Adaptation Platform (Climate-ADAPT) catalogs
adaptation actions reported by EU Member States (EC, 2013a). The EU

"This chapter reviews the scientific evidence published since the IPCC
Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) on observed and projected impacts of
anthropogenic climate change in Europe and adaptation responses. The
geographical scope of this chapter is the same as in AR4 with the
inclusion of Turkey. Thus, the European region includes all countries from
Iceland in the west to the Russian Federation (west of the Urals) and
the Caspian Sea in the east, and from the northern shores of the
Mediterranean and Black Seas and the Caucasus in the south to the
Arctic Ocean in the north. Impacts above the Arctic Circle are addressed
in Chapter 28 and impacts in the Baltic and Mediterranean Seas in
Chapter 30. Impacts in Malta, Cyprus, and other island states in Europe
are discussed in Chapter 29. The European region has been divided into
five sub-regions (see Figure 23-1): Atlantic, Alpine, Southern, Northern,
and Continental. The sub-regions are derived by aggregating the climate
zones developed by Metzger et al. (2005) and therefore represent
geographical and ecological zones rather than political boundaries. The
scientific evidence has been evaluated to compare impacts across
(rather than within) sub-regions, although this was not always possible
depending on the scientific information available.

"Forest in Europe covers approximately 34% of the land area (Eurostat,
2009). The majority of forests now grow faster than in the early 20th
century as a result of advances in forest management practices, genetic
improvement, and, in Central Europe, the cessation of site-degrading
practices such as litter collection for fuel. Increasing temperatures and
carbon dioxide (CO,) concentrations, nitrogen deposition, and the
reduction of air pollution (sulfur dioxide (SO,)) have also had a positive
effect on forest growth. Scenario studies suggest that forested areas will
increase in Europe in the future on land formerly used for agriculture
(Rounsevell et al., 2006). Soil degradation is already intense in parts of
the Mediterranean and Central-Eastern Europe and, together with
prolonged drought periods and fires, is already contributing to an
increased risk of desertification. Projected risks for future desertification
are the highest in these areas (EEA, 2012).

"Europe is one of the world’s largest and most productive suppliers of
food and fiber (Easterling et al., 2007). Agriculture is an important land
use across the European region; for example, it covers about 35% of
the total land area of western Europe (Rounsevell et al., 2006). After
1945, an unprecedented increase in agricultural productivity occurred,
but also declines in agricultural land use areas. This intensification had
several negative impacts on the ecological properties of agricultural
systems, such as carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling, soil structure and
functioning, water purification, and pollination. Pollution from agriculture
has led to eutrophication and declines in water quality in some areas
(Langmead et al., 2007). Most scenario studies suggest that agricultural
land areas will continue to decrease in the future (see also Busch,
2006, for a discussion). Agriculture accounts for 24% of total national

"European countries are diverse in both demographic and economic
trends. Population health and social welfare have improved everywhere
in Europe, with reductions in adult and child mortality rates, but social
inequalities both within and between countries persist (Marmot et al.,
2012). Population has increased in most EU27 countries, primarily as a
result of net immigration (Eurostat, 2011), although population growth
is slow (total and working age population; Rees et al., 2012). Aging of
the population is a significant trend in Europe. This will have both
economic and social implications, with many regions experiencing a
decline in the labor force (Rees et al., 2012). Since AR4, economic
growth has slowed or become negative in many countries, leading to a
reduction in social protection measures and increased unemployment
(Eurostat, 2011b). The longer term implications of the financial crisis in
Europe are unclear, although it may lead to a modification of the economic
outlook and affect future social protection policies with implications for
adaptation.

"Urban development is projected to increase all over Europe (Reginster
and Rounsevell, 2006), but especially rapidly in Eastern Europe, with the
magnitude of these increases depending on population growth, economic
growth, and land use planning policy. Although changes in urban land
use will be relatively small in area terms, urban development has major
impacts locally on environmental quality. Outdoor air quality has,
however, been improving (Langmead et al., 2007). Peri-urbanization is
an increasing trend in which residents move out of cities to locations
with a rural character, but retain a functional link to cities by commuting
to work (Reginster and Rounsevell, 2006; Rounsevell and Reay, 2009).
Several European scenario studies have been undertaken to describe
European future trends with respect to socioeconomic development (de
Mooij and Tang, 2003), land use change (Verburg et al., 2010; Haines-
Young et al., 2012; Letourneau et al., 2012), land use and biodiversity
(Spangenberg et al., 2011), crop production (Hermans et al., 2010),
demographic change (Davoudi et al., 2010), economic development
(Dammers, 2010), and European policy (Lennert and Robert, 2010;
Helming et al., 2011). Many of these scenarios also account for the
effects of future climate change (see Rounsevell and Metzger, 2010,
for a review). Long-term projections (to the end of the century) are
described under the new Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios
(SSPs) (Kriegler et al., 2010). Detailed country and regional scale
socioeconomic scenarios have also been produced for the Netherlands
(WLO, 2006), the UK (UK National Ecosystem Assessment, 2011), and
Scotland (Harrison et al., 2013). The probabilistic representation of
socioeconomic futures has also been developed for agricultural land
use change (Hardacre et al., 2013). There is little evidence to suggest,
however, that probabilistic futures or scenarios more generally are being
used in policy making (Bryson et al., 2010).

are highly variable (Bouwer et al., 2008); for instance, in France, upward
trends in low flows were observed over 1948-1988 and downward

"The analysis of trends in droughts is made complex by the different
categories or definitions of drought (meteorological, agricultural, and
hydrological) and the lack of long-term observational data (SREX Box
3-3). Southern Europe shows trends toward more intense and longer
meteorological droughts, but they are still inconsistent (Sousa et al., 2011).
Drought trends in all other sub-regions are not statistically significant
(SREX Section 3.5.1). Regional and global climate simulations project
(medium confidence) an increase in duration and intensity of droughts in
Central and Southern Europe and the Mediterranean up until the UK for
different definitions of drought (Gao and Giorgi, 2008; Feyen and Dankers,
2009; Vidal and Wade, 2009; Koutroulis et al., 2010; Tsanis et al., 2011;
Chapter 21). Even in regions where summer precipitation is expected
to increase, soil moisture and hydrological droughts may become more
severe as a result of increasing evapotranspiration (Wong et al., 2011).
Projected changes in the length of meteorological dry spells show that
the increase is large in Southern Europe (Figure 23-2d).

"Climate change is projected to affect the hydrology of river basins
(Chapter 4; SREX Chapter 3). The occurrence of current 100-year return
period discharges is projected to increase in Continental Europe, but
decrease in some parts of Northern and Southern Europe by 2100 (Dankers
and Feyen, 2008; Rojas et al., 2012). In contrast, studies for individual
catchments indicate increases in extreme discharges, to varying degrees,
in Finland (Veijalainen et al., 2010), Denmark (Thodsen, 2007), Ireland
(Wang et al., 2006; Steele-Dunne et al., 2008; Bastola et al., 2011), the

winter rainfall could lead to higher peak discharges in Northern Europe

UK (Christierson et al., 2012), Turkey (Fujihara et al., 2008), France

respectively; Ciscar et al., 2011). The Atlantic, Northern, and Southern
European regions are projected to be most affected. Direct costs from
sea level rise in the EU27 without adaptation could reach €17 billion per
year by 2100 (Hinkel et al., 2010), with indirect costs also estimated for
land-locked countries (Bosello et al., 2012). Countries with high absolute
damage costs include Netherlands, Germany, France, Belgium, Denmark,
Spain, and Italy (Hinkel et al., 2010). Upgrading coastal defenses would
substantially reduce impacts and damage costs (Hinkel et al., 2010).

The observed increase in river flood events and damages in Europe is
well documented (see Section 18.4.2.1); however, the main cause is
increased exposure of persons and property in flood risk areas (Barredo,
2009). Since AR4, new studies provide a wider range of estimates of
future economic losses from river flooding attributable to climate
change, depending on the modeling approach and climate scenario
(Bubeck et al., 2011). Studies now also quantify risk under changes in
population and economic growth, generally indicating this contribution
to be about equal or larger than climate change per se (Feyen et al.,

time spent driving (Sabir et al., 2010). Severe snow and ice-related
accidents will also decrease, but the effect of fewer frost days on total
accidents is unclear (Andersson and Chapman, 201 1a,b). Severe accidents
caused by extreme weather are projected to decrease by 63 to 70% in

example, a study of Paris (Lemonsu et al., 2013) indicated a future
reduction in strong urban heat island events when increased soil
dryness was taken into effect. Modification of the built environment,

"In the European Alps, the frequency of rock avalanches and large rock
slides has apparently increased over the period 1900-2007 (Fischer et
al., 2012). The frequency of landslides may also have increased in some
locations (Lopez Saez et al., 2013). Mass movements are projected to
become more frequent with climate change (Huggel et al., 2010; Stoffel
and Huggel, 2012), although several studies indicate a more complex or
stabilizing response of mass movements to climate change (Dixon and
Brook, 2007; Jomelli et al., 2007, 2009; Huggel et al., 2012; Melchiorre
and Frattini, 2012). Some land use practices have led to conditions
favorable to increased landslide risk, despite climate trends that would
result in a decrease of landslide frequency, as reported in Calabria
(Polemio and Petrucci, 2010) and in the Apennines (Wasowski et al.,
2010). Snow avalanche frequency changes in Europe are dominated by
climate variability; studies based on avalanche observations (Eckert et
al., 2010) or favorable meteorological conditions (Castebrunet et al.,
2012; Teich et al., 2012) show contrasting variations, depending on the
region, elevation, season, and orientation.

Seasonal changes will be prominent, especially for electricity (see Figure

are expected to decrease by 11 to 20% between 2000 and 2050 due

large percentage increases up to 2050 are estimated by the same
authors for most of Europe as the current penetration of cooling
devices is low; then, increases by 74 to 118% in 2100 (depending on
the region) from 2050 are expected under the combined effect of
climatic and non-climatic drivers. In Southern Europe, cooling degree
days by 2060 will increase, while heating degree days will decrease but

(Tervo, 2008). Up to 2050, demographic changes (e.g., population
declines in source countries, aging populations) may have a higher
impact than climate change (Steiger, 2012). Artificial snowmaking has
physical and economic limitations, especially in small sized and low-

"The regional distribution of climate change impacts on agricultural
production is likely to vary widely (Donatelli et al., 2012; Iglesias et al.,
2012; see also Figure 23-4). Southern Europe would experience the
largest yield losses (-25% by 2080 under a 5.4°C warming; Ciscar et
al., 2011), with increased risks of rainfed summer crop failure (Ferrara
et al., 2010; Bindi and Olesen, 2011; Ruiz-Ramos et al., 2011). Warmer
and drier conditions by 2050 (Trnka et al., 2010, 2011) would cause
moderate declines in crop yields in Central Europe regions (Ciscar et al.,
"	Text
"2011). In Western Europe, increased heat stress around flowering could
cause considerable yield losses in wheat (Semenov, 2009). For Northern
Europe, there is diverging evidence concerning future impacts. Positive
yield changes combined with the expansion of climatically suitable
areas could lead to crop production increases (between 2.5°C and 5.4°C
regional warming) (Bindi and Olesen, 2011). However, increased climatic
variability would limit winter crops expansion (Peltonen-Sainio et al.,
2010) and cause at high latitudes high risk of marked cereal yield loss
(Rotter et al., 2011). Spring crops from tropical origin like maize for
silage could become cultivated in Finland by the end of the century
(Peltonen-Sainio et al., 2009). Cereal yield reduction from ozone (Fuhrer,
2009) could reach 6 and 10 % in 2030 for the European Union with the
B1 and A2 scenarios, respectively (Avnery et al., 2011a,b). Because of
limited land availability and soil fertility outside of Chernozem (black
earth) areas, the shift of agriculture to the boreal forest zone would not
compensate for crop losses owing to increasing aridity in South European
regions of Russia with the best soils (Dronin and Kirilenko, 2011).

"Autonomous adaptation by farmers, through the advancement of
sowing and harvesting dates and the use of longer cycle varieties
(Howden et al., 2007; Moriondo et al., 2010a, 2011; Olesen et al., 2011)
could result in a general improvement of European wheat yields in the
2030s compared to the 2000s (Donatelli et al, 2012; see also Figure
23-4). However, farmer sowing dates seem to advance slower than crop
phenology (Menzel et al., 2006; Siebert and Ewert, 2012), possibly
because earlier sowing is often prevented by lack of soil workability and
frost-induced soil crumbling (Oort et al., 2012). Simulation studies that
anticipate on earlier sowing in Europe may thus be overly optimistic.
Further adaptation options include changes in crop species, fertilization,
irrigation, drainage, land allocation, and farming system (Bindi and
Olesen, 2011).At the high range of the projected temperature changes,
only plant breeding aimed at increasing yield potential jointly with
drought resistance and adjusted agronomic practices may reduce risks
of yield shortfall (Olesen et al., 2011; Rotter et al., 2011; Ventrella et al.,
2012). Crop breeding is, however, challenged by temperature and
rainfall variability, since (1) breeding has not yet succeeded in altering

"With generally warmer and drier conditions, deep rooted weeds (Gilgen
et al., 2010) and weeds with contrasting physiology, such as C, species,
could pose a more serious threat (Bradley et al., 2010) to crops than
shallow rooted C; weeds (Stratonovitch, 2012). Arthropod-borne diseases
(viruses and phytoplasmas), winter infection root and stem diseases
(phoma stem canker of oilseed rape and eyespot of wheat; Butterworth
et al., 2010; West et al, 2012), Fusarium blight (Madgwick et al., 2011),
grapevine moth (Caffarra et al, 2012), and a black rot fungus in fruit
trees (Weber, 2009) could create increasing damages in Europe under
climate change. However, other pathogens such as cereal stem rots (e.g.,
Puccinia striiformis; Luck et al., 2011) and grapevine powdery mildew
(Caffarra et al., 2012) could be limited by increasing temperatures.
Increased damages from plant pathogens and insect pests are projected
by 2050 in Nordic countries, which have hitherto been protected by cold
winters and geographic isolation (Hakala et al., 2011; Roos et al, 2011).
Some pests, such as the European corn borer (Trnka et al., 2007), could
also extend their climate niche in Central Europe. Pests and disease
management will be affected with regard to timing, preference, and
efficacy of chemical and biological measures of control (Kersebaum et

"In AR4, Alcamo et al. (2007) reported that crop suitability is likely to
change throughout Europe. During the 2003 and 2010 summer heat
waves, grain-harvest losses reached 20 and 25-30% in affected regions
of Europe and Russia, respectively (Ciais et al., 2005; Barriopedro et al.,
2011; see also Table 23-1). Cereals production fell on average by 40%
in the Iberian Peninsula during the intense 2004/2005 drought (EEA,
2010a). Climate-induced variability in wheat production has increased
in recent decades in Southern and Central Europe (Ladanyi, 2008;
Brisson et al., 2010; Hawkins et al., 2013), but no consistent reduction
has been recorded in the northernmost areas of Europe (Peltonen-Sainio
et al., 2010). Country-scale rainfed cereals yields are below agro-climatic
potentials (Supit et al, 2010), and wheat yield increases have leveled
off in several countries over 1961-2009 (Olesen et al., 2011). High
temperatures and droughts during grain filling have contributed to the
lack of yield increase of winter wheat in France despite improvements
in crop breeding (Brisson et al., 2010; Kristensen et al., 2011). In contrast,
in eastern Scotland, warming has favored an increase in potato yields
since 1960 (Gregory and Marshall, 2012). In northeast Spain, grape yield
was reduced by an increased water deficit in the reproductive stage
since the 1960s (Camps and Ramos, 2012).

"Insight into the potential effect of climate change on crops requires the
combination of a wide range of emission scenarios, Global Climate
Models (GCMs), and impact studies (Trnka et al., 2007; Soussana et al.,
2010). In the EU27, a 2.5°C regional temperature increase in the 2080s
under the B2 scenario could lead to small changes (on average +3%)
in crop yields, whereas a 5.4°C regional warming under the A2 scenario
could reduce mean yields by 10% according to a study based on
regional climate models (Ciscar et al., 2011). An initial benefit from the
increasing CO, concentration for rainfed crop yields would contrast by
the end of the century with yield declines in most European sub-regions,
although wheat yield could increase under the A2 scenario (three GCMs,
B1, A2 scenarios; Supit et al., 2012). Disease-limited yields of rainfed
wheat and maize in the 2030s does not show consistent trends across
two GCMs (Donatelli et al., 2012). For a global temperature increase of
5°C, agroclimatic indices show an increasing frequency of extremely
unfavorable years in European cropping areas (Trnka et al., 2011). Under
the A2 and B2 scenarios, crop production shortfalls, defined as years
with production below 50% of its average climate normal production
would double by 2020 and triple by 2070 as compared to a current
frequency of 1 to 3 years per decade in the currently most productive
southern European regions of Russia (Alcamo et al., 2007).

"Climate change has affected animal health in Europe (high confidence).
The spread of bluetongue virus in sheep across Europe has been partly
attributed to climate change (Arzt et al., 2010; Guis et al., 2012) through
increased seasonal activity of the Culicoides vector (Wilson and Mellor,
2009). The distribution of this vector is unlikely to expand but its
abundance could increase in Southern Europe (Acevedo et al., 2010).
Ticks, the primary arthropod vectors of zoonotic diseases in Europe (e.g.,
Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis), have changed distributions
towards higher altitudes and latitudes with climate change (Randolph
and Rogers, 2010; van Dijk et al., 2010; Petney et al., 2012; see also
Section 23.5). Exposure to fly strike could increase in a warmer climate
but adaptation in husbandry practices would limit impacts on livestock
(Wall and Ellse, 2011). The overall risk of incursion of Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever virus in livestock through infected ticks introduced
by migratory bird species would not be increased by climate change
(Gale et al., 2012). The probability of introduction and large-scale spread
of Rift Valley fever in Europe is also very low (Chevalier et al., 2010).
Epidemiological surveillance and increased coordinated regional
monitoring and control programs have the potential to reduce the
incidence of vector-borne animal diseases (Wilson and Mellor, 2009;

"Future projected trends confirm the widening of water resource
differences between Northern and Southern Europe reported in AR4
(Alcamo et al., 2007). In Southern Europe, soil water content will
decline, saturation conditions and drainage will be increasingly rare and
restricted to periods in winter and spring, and snow accumulation and
melting will change, especially in the mid-mountain areas (Garcia-
Ruiz et al., 2011). Across most of Northern and Continental Europe, an
increase in flood hazards (Falloon and Betts, 2010; see also Section
23.3.1) could increase damages to crops and plant growth, complicate
soil workability, and increase yield variability (Olesen et al., 2011).
Groundwater recharge and/or water table level would be significantly
reduced by the end of the 21st century under A2 scenario for river basins
located in southern Italy, Spain, northern France, and Belgium (Ducharne
et al., 2010; Goderniaux et al., 2011; Guardiola-Albert and Jackson,
2011; Senatore et al., 2011). However, nonsignificant impacts were
found for aquifers in Switzerland and in England (Jackson et al., 2011;
Stoll et al., 2011). Less precipitation in summer and higher rainfall
during winter could increase nitrate leaching (Kersebaum et al., 2008)
with negative impacts on water quality (Bindi and Olesen, 2011).
Even with reduced nitrogen fertilizer application, groundwater nitrate
concentrations would increase by the end of the century in the Seine
river basin (Ducharne et al., 2007). More robust water management,
pricing, and recycling policies to secure adequate future water supply
and prevent tensions among users could be required in Southern Europe
(Garcia-Ruiz et al., 2011).

"Reduced suitability for rainfed agricultural production (Henriques et al.,
2008; Daccache and Lamaddalena, 2010; Trnka et al., 2011; Daccache
et al., 2012) will increase water demand for crop irrigation (Savé et al.,
2012). However, increased irrigation may not be a viable option,
especially in the Mediterranean area, because of projected declines in
total runoff and groundwater resources (Olesen et al., 2011). In a number
of catchments water resources are already over-licensed and/or over-
abstracted (Daccache et al., 2012) and their reliability is threatened by
climate change-induced decline in groundwater recharge and to a lesser
extent by the increase in potential demand for irrigation (Ducharne et
al., 2010; Majone et al., 2012). To match this demand, irrigation system
costs could increase by 20 to 27% in southern Italy (Daccache and
Lamaddalena, 2010) and new irrigation infrastructures would be
required in some regions (van der Velde et al., 2010). However, since the
economic benefits are expected to be small, the adoption of irrigation
would require changes in institutional and market conditions (Finger et
al., 2011). Moreover, since aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems are
affected by agricultural water use (Klove et al., 2011), irrigation demand
restrictions are projected in environmentally focussed future regional
scenarios (Henriques et al., 2008). Earlier sowing dates, increased soil
organic matter content, low-energy systems, deficit irrigation, and
improved water use efficiency of irrigation systems and crops can be
used as adaptation pathways (Gonzalez-Camacho et al., 2008; Lee et
al., 2008; Daccache and Lamaddalena, 2010; Schutze and Schmitz,
2010), especially in Southern and southeastern regions of Europe (Trnka
et al., 2009; Falloon and Betts, 2010). Improved water management in

"=cosystems provide a number of vital provisioning, regulating, and cultural services for people and society that flow from the stock
atural capital (Stoate et al., 2009; Harrison et al., 2010). Provisioning services such as food from agro-ecosystems or timber from
orests derive from intensively managed ecosystems; regulating services underpin the functioning of the climate and hydrological
systems; and cultural services such as tourism, recreation, and aesthetic value are vital for societal well-being (see Section 23.5.4).
[he table summarizes the potential impacts of climate change on ecosystem services in Europe by sub-region based on an assessme
of the published literature (2004-2013). The direction of change (increasing, decreasing, or neutral) is provided, as well as the numb
of studies/papers on which the assessment was based (in parentheses). Empty cells indicate the absence of appropriate literature.
Jnless otherwise stated, impacts assume no adaptation and are assessed for the mid-century (2050s). A decrease in natural hazar
egulation (e.g., for wildfires) implies an increased risk of the hazard occurring. Biodiversity is included here as a service (for
-ompleteness), although it is debated whether biodiversity should be considered as a service or as part of the natural capital from
which services flow. What is agreed, however, is that biodiversity losses within an ecosystem will have deleterious effects on servic
drovision (Mouillot et al., 2013).

"Numerous studies confirm the amplification through fishing of the
effects of climate change on population dynamics and consequently on
fisheries (Planque et al., 2010). The decline of the North Sea cod during
the 1980-2000 period resulted from the combined effects of overfishing
and of an ecosystem regime shift due to climate change (Beaugrand
and Kirby, 2010). Over the next decade, this stock was not restored from
its previous collapse (Mieszkowska et al., 2009; ICES, 2010). In the North
and Celtic Seas, the steep decline in boreal species (Henderson, 2007)
was compensated for by the arrival of southern (Lusitanian) species (ter
Hofstede et al., 2010; Engelhard et al., 2011; Lenoir et al., 2011).

"Climate change is likely to have a range of health effects in Europe.
Studies since AR4 have confirmed the effects of heat on mortality and
morbidity in European populations and particularly in older people and
those with chronic disease (Kovats and Hajat, 2008; Astrém et al., 2011;
Corobov et al., 2012, 2013). With respect to sub-regional vulnerability,
populations in Southern Europe appear to be most sensitive to hot weather
(Michelozzi et al, 2009; D'Ippoliti et al., 2010; Baccini et al., 2011), and
also will experience the highest heat wave exposures (Figure 23-2).
However, populations in Continental (Hertel et al., 2009) and Northern
Europe (Rocklév and Forsberg, 2010; Armstrong et al., 2011; Varakina et
al., 2011) are also vulnerable to heat wave events. Adaptation measures
to reduce heat health effects include heat wave plans (Bittner et al.,
2013) which have been shown to reduce heat-related mortality in Italy
(Schifano et al., 2012), but evidence of effectiveness is still very limited
(Hajat et al., 2010; Lowe et al., 2011). There is little information about

"Fishery management thresholds will have to be reassessed as the
ecological basis on which existing thresholds have been established
changes, and new thresholds will have to be developed for immigrant
species (Mackenzie et al., 2007; Beaugrand and Reid, 2012). These
changes may lead to loss of productivity, but also the opening of new
fishing opportunities, depending on the interactions between climate
impacts, fishing grounds, and fleet types. They will also affect fishing
regulations, the price of fish products, and operating costs, which in
turn will affect the economic performance of the fleets (Cheung et al.,
2012). Climate change impacts on fisheries profits range from negative
for sardine fishery in the Iberian Atlantic fishing grounds (Garza-Gil et
al., 2010; Perez et al., 2010) to nonsignificant for the Bay of Biscay (Le
Floc’h et al., 2008) and positive on the Portuguese coast, since most of
the immigrant fish species are marketable (Vinagre et al. 2011). Human
social fishing systems dealing with high variability upwelling systems
with rapidly reproducing fish species may have greater capacities to
adjust to the additional stress of climate change than human social fishing
systems focused on longer-lived and generally less variable species
(Perry et al., 2010, 2011). Climate change adaptation is being considered
for integration in European maritime and fisheries operational programs
(EC, 2013¢).

"In AR4, Easterling et al. (2007) reported that the recruitment and
production of marine fisheries in the North Atlantic are /ikely to increase.
In European seas, warming causes a displacement to the north and/or
in depth of fish populations (Daufresne et al., 2009; see also Chapter 6;
Section 23.6.4), which has a direct impact on fisheries (Tasker, 2008;
Cheung et al., 2010, 2013). For instance, in British waters, the lesser
sandeel (Ammodytes marinus), which is a key link in the food web,
shows declining recruitments since 2002 and is projected to further
decline in the future with a warming climate (Heath et al., 2012). In the
Baltic Sea, although some new species would be expected to immigrate
because of an expected increase in sea temperature, only a few of these
would be able to successfully colonize the Baltic because of its low
salinity (Mackenzie et al., 2007). In response to climate change and
intensive fishing, widespread reductions in fish body size (Daufresne et
al., 2009) and in the mean size of zooplankton (Beaugrand and Reid,
2012) have been observed over time and these trends further affect the
sustainability of fisheries (Pitois and Fox, 2006; Beaugrand and Kirby,
2010; see also Chapter 6). Aquaculture can be affected as the areal
extent of some habitats that are suitable for aquaculture can be reduced
by sea level rise. Observed higher water temperatures have adversely
affected both wild and farmed freshwater salmon production in the
southern part of the distribution areas (Jonsson and Jonsson, 2009). In
addition, ocean acidification may disrupt the early developmental
stages of shellfish (Callaway et al., 2012).

that death rates among in-patients increased significantly during heat

"Other potential consequences concern marine biotoxins in seafood
following production of phycotoxins by harmful algal blooms and the
presence of pathogenic bacteria in foods following more frequent extreme

or water (e.g., persistent organic pollutants). Risk modeling is often
developed for single-exposure agents (e.g., a pesticide) with known
routes of exposure. These are difficult to scale up to the population level.
The multiple mechanisms by which climate may affect transmission or
contamination routes also make this very complex (Boxall et al., 2009).

climate change risks: ongoing surveillance programs, collaboration with

albopictus (a vector of dengue and Chikungunya; Queyriaux et al., 2008)

eastward and northward under climate change (Fisher et al., 2011; Roiz

on which a country relies, the loss or compromise of which would lead
to severe economic or social consequences or to loss of life. Extreme
weather events, such as floods, heat waves, and wild fires are known
to damage critical infrastructure. The UK floods in 2007 led to significant
damage to power and water utilities, and to communications and transport
infrastructure (Chatterton et al., 2010; see also Table 23-1). Forest fires
can affect transport infrastructure, as well as the destruction of buildings.
Major storms in Sweden and Finland have led to loss of trees, with

of either vectors or current parasites northwards (Ready, 2010). The risk
of introduction of exotic Leishmania species was considered very low due
to the low competence of current vectors (Fischer, D. et al., 2010). The
effect of climate change on the risk of imported or locally transmitted
(autochthonous) malaria in Europe has been assessed in Spain (Sainz-
Elipe et al., 2010), France (Linard et al., 2009), and the UK (Lindsay et

significant changes in land use, as well as climate change (see Chapter

"Wine production in Europe accounts for more than 60% of the global total (Goode, 2012) and makes an important contribution to
cultural identity. Apart from impacts on grapevine yield, higher temperatures are also expected to affect wine quality in some regior
and grape varieties by changing the ratio between sugar and acids (Duchéne et al., 2010; Bock et al., 2011; Santos et al., 2011). In
Western and Central Europe, projected future changes could benefit wine quality, but might also demarcate new potential areas for
viticulture (Malheiro et al., 2010). Adaptation measures are already occurring in some vineyards (e.g., vine management, technologica
measures, production control, and to a smaller extent relocation; Battaglini et al., 2009; Holland and Smit, 2010; Malheiro et al.,
2010; Duarte Alonso and O'Neill, 2011; Moriondo et al., 2011; Santos et al., 2011).Vineyards may be displaced geographically beyon
their traditional boundaries (""terroir” linked to soil, climate, and traditions; Metzger and Rounsevell, 2011) and, in principle, wine
producers could adapt to this problem by growing grape varieties that are more suited to warmer climates. Such technical solutions,
however, do not account for the unique characteristics of wine production cultures and consumer perceptions of wine quality that
strongly affect the prices paid for the best wines (White et al., 2009; Metzger and Rounsevell, 2011). It would become very difficult,
for example, to produce fine wines from the cool-climate Pinot Noir grape within its traditional “terroir” of Burgundy under many
future climate scenarios, but consumers may not be willing to pay current day prices for red wines produced from other grape varietie
(Metzger and Rounsevell, 2011). An additional barrier to adaptation is that wine is usually produced within rigid, regionally specific,
regulatory frameworks that often prescribe, among other things, what grapes can be grown where, for example, the French AOC
(Appellation d'Origine Controlee) or the Italian DOC (Denominazione di Origine Controllata) and DOCG (Denominazione di Origine
Controllata e Garantita) designations. Suggestions have been made to replace these rigid concepts of regional identity with a
geographically flexible “terroir” that ties a historical or constructed sense of culture to the wine maker and not to the region (White
et al., 2009).

49 and 87% (Scholz et al., 2008). Preserving upland vegetation reduced
both erosion and loss of soil carbon and favored the delivery of a high-

depreciation of land, and costs related to the ecosystem functions of

summer soil moisture in the Mediterranean region, and increases in the
northeastern part of Europe (Calanca et al., 2006). Climate change
impacts on erosion shows diverging evidence under the A2 scenario. In
Tuscany, even with a decline in precipitation volume until 2070, in some
months higher erosion rates would occur because of higher rainfall
erosivity (Marker et al, 2008). For two Danish river catchments, assuming
a steady-state land use, suspended sediment transport would increase
by 17 to 27% by 2071-2100 (Thodsen, 2007; Thodsen et al., 2008). In
Upper Austria, with the regional climate model HadRM3H, a small
reduction in average soil losses is projected for croplands in all tillage

Ireland, erosion decreases are generally projected with downscaled

"Europe has many unique rural landscapes, which reflect the cultural
heritage that has evolved from centuries of human intervention, for
example, the cork oak based Montado in Portugal, the Garrigue of southern
France, Alpine meadows, grouse moors in the UK, machair in Scotland,
peatlands in Ireland, the polders of Belgium and the Netherlands, and
vineyards. Many, if not all, of these cultural landscapes are sensitive
to climate change and even small changes in the climate could have
significant impacts (Gifford et al, 2011). Alpine meadows, for example,
are culturally important within Europe, but although there is analysis
of the economics (tourism, farming) and functionality (water runoff,
flooding, and carbon sequestration) of these landscapes there is very
little understanding of how climate change will affect the cultural
aspects on which local communities depend. Because of their societal
value, cultural landscapes are often protected and managed through
rural development and environmental policies. The peat-rich uplands of
Northern Europe, for example, have begun to consider landscape
management as a means of adapting to the effects of climate change
(e.g., the moors for the future partnership in the Peak District National
Park, UK). For a discussion of the cultural implications of climate change
for vineyards, see Box 23-2.

Climate change is projected to increase nutrient loadings: In Northern
Europe this is caused by increased surface runoff, and in Southern Europe
by increased evapotranspiration and increased concentrations due to
reduced volumes of receiving lakes (Jeppesen et al., 2011). Local studies
generally confirm this pattern. Increased nutrient loads are foreseen in
Danish watersheds (Andersen et al., 2006), and in France (Delpla et al.,

for food production and forestry (Section 23.4), ecosystem functioning
(Box 23-1), human and animal health, and compliance with environmental
quality standards, including those of the Water Framework Directive.
Shallower waters will witness a more rapid temperature increase than
deeper waters, since heat is absorbed mainly in the upper water layers
and turbulent mixing is truncated by shallow depth. In parallel, a decrease
in saturating oxygen concentrations occurs. Since AR4, there is further
evidence of adverse effects caused by extreme weather events:
reductions in dissolved oxygen, algal blooms (Mooij et al., 2007; Ulén
and Weyhenmeyer, 2007) during hot weather, and contamination of
surface and coastal waters with sewage and/or chemicals (pesticides)
after rainfall (Boxall et al., 2009). A reduction in rainfall may lead to
low flows that increase concentrations of biological and chemical
contaminants. Reduced drainage can also enhance sedimentation in

for Europe's breeding birds are projected to shift nearly 550 km northeast

analyses, some of which include non-market costs and benefits
(externalities) (Watkiss and Hunt, 2010). This section describes policies,
strategies, and measures where there is good evidence regarding
mitigation/adaptation costs and benefits. Few studies have quantified
directly the trade-offs/synergies for a given policy.

"national levels. It is stressed that the costing studies use a range of
methods and metrics and relate to different time periods and sectors,
which renders robust comparison difficult. As an example, there are
large differences between the cost estimates for coastal and river
protection in the Netherlands and other parts of Europe (Table 23-2),
which is due to the objectives for adaptation and the large differences
in the level of acceptable risk. For example, Rojas et al. (2013) assess a
1-in-100 year level of protection for Europe, while the Netherlands has
set standards up to 1-in-4000 and 10,000-year level return periods.

"Mitigation policies (decarbonization strategies) are likely to have
important implications for dwellings across Europe. The unintended
consequences of mitigation in the housing sector include changes to
household energy prices and adverse effects from decreased ventilation
in dwellings (Jenkins et al., 2008; Jenkins, 2009; Davies and Oreszczyn,
2012; Mavrogianni et al., 2012). The location, type, and dominant
energy use of the building will determine its overall energy gain or loss
to maintain comfort levels. Adaptation measures such as the use of
cooling devices will probably increase a building's energy consumption
if no other mitigation measures are applied. The potential for cooling
dwellings without increased energy consumption, and with health
benefits is large (Wilkinson et al., 2009).

Some infrastructure adaptation strategies—such as desalinization, sea

on both mitigation and biodiversity. However, approaches, such as
forest conservation and urban green space (Section 23.7.4) have
multiple benefits and potentially significant effects. There has been
relatively little research about the impacts of future land use demand
for bioenergy production, food production, and urbanization on nature

"sequestration in arable systems (Rosenzweig and Tubiello, 2007;
Rosenzweig et al., 2008), but increased irrigation under climate change
would increase energy use and may reduce water availability for hydro-
power (reduced mitigation potential) (Wreford et al., 2010). In intensive
livestock systems, warmer conditions in the coming decades might
trigger the implementation of enhanced cooling and ventilation in farm
buildings (Rosenzweig and Tubiello, 2007), thereby increasing energy
use and associated GHG emissions. In grass-based livestock systems,
adaptation by adjusting the mean annual animal stocking density to
the herbage growth potential (Graux et al., 2012) is likely to create a
positive feedback on GHG emissions per unit area (Soussana and
Luscher, 2007; Soussana et al., 2010).

"In tourism, adaptation and mitigation may be antagonistic, as in the
case of artificial snowmaking in European ski resorts, which requires
significant amounts of energy and water (OECD, 2007; Rixen et al.,
2011), and the case of desalination for potable water production, which
also requires energy. However, depending on the location and size of
the resort, implications are expected to differ and thus need to be
investigated on a case-by-case basis. A similar relationship between
adaptation and mitigation may hold for tourist settlements in Southern
Europe, where expected temperature increases during the summer may
require increased cooling to maintain tourist comfort and thus increase
GHG emissions and operating costs. Furthermore, a change of tourist
flows as a result of tourists adapting to climate change may affect
transport emissions, while mitigation in transport could also lead to a
change in transport prices and thus possibly affect tourist flows.

"Land management options may also create synergies and trade-offs
between mitigation and adaptation. Careful adaptation of forestry and
soil management practices will be required to preserve a continental
ecosystem carbon sink in Europe (Schulze et al., 2010) despite the
vulnerability of this sink to climatic extremes (Ciais et al., 2005) and first
signs of carbon sink saturation in European forest biomass (Nabuurs et
al., 2013). In areas that are vulnerable to extreme events (e.g., fires,
storms, droughts) or with high water demand, the development of
bioenergy production from energy crops and from agricultural residues
(Fischer, G. et al., 2010; De Wit et al., 2011) could further increase demands
on adaptation (Wreford et al., 2010). Conversely, increased demands
on mitigation could be induced by the potential expansion of agriculture
at high latitudes, which may release large amounts of carbon and
nitrogen from organic soils (Rosenzweig and Tubiello, 2007).

"In arable production systems, adapting to climate change by increasing
the resilience of crop yields to heat and to rainfall variability would
have positive impacts on mitigation by reducing soil erosion, as well as
soil organic carbon and nitrogen losses. Improving soil water holding
capacity through the addition of crop residues and manure to arable
soils, or by adding diversity to the crop rotations, may contribute both
to adaptation and to mitigation (Smith and Olesen, 2010). There are
also synergies and trade-offs between mitigation and adaptation options
for soil tillage, irrigation, and livestock breeding (Smith and Olesen,
2010). Reduced tillage (and no-till) may contribute to both adaptation
and mitigation as it tends to reduce soil erosion and runoff (Soane et
al., 2012) and fossil-fuel use (Khaledian et al., 2010), while increasing
in some situations soil organic carbon stock (Powlson et al., 2011).
However, increased N,O emission may negate the mitigation effect of
reduced tillage (Powlson et al., 2011). Irrigation may enhance soil carbon

"Agriculture and forestry face two challenges under climate change,
both to reduce emissions and to adapt to a changing and more variable
climate (Lavalle et al., 2009; Smith and Olesen, 2010). The agriculture
sector contributes about 10% of the total anthropogenic GHG emissions
in the EU27 (EEA, 2010b). Estimates of European CO., methane, and NO,
fluxes between 2000 and 2005 suggest that methane emissions from
livestock and NO, emissions from agriculture are fully compensated for
by the CO, sink provided by forests and by grassland soils (Schulze et
al., 2010). However, projections following a baseline scenario suggest
a significant decline (-25 to -40%) of the forest carbon sink of the EU
until 2030 compared to 2010. Using wood for bioenergy results initially
in a carbon debt due to reduced storage in forests, which affects the
net GHG balance depending on the energy type that is replaced and
the time span considered (McKechnie et al., 2011). Including additional
bioenergy targets of EU member states has an effect on the development
of the European forest carbon sink (and on the carbon stock), which is
not accounted for in the EU emission reduction target (Bottcher et al.,
2012).

Observed migration rates are less than that assumed in modeling

forest species in France). New evidence reveals that phenological
mismatch will cause additional adverse effects on some species.

"Additional risks have emerged trom the assessed literature:

Increased summer energy demand, especially in Southern Europe,
requires additional power generation capacity (underutilized during
the rest of the year), entailing higher supply costs.

Housing will be affected, with increased overheating under no
adaptation and damage from subsidence and flooding. Passive
cooling measures alone are unlikely to be sufficient to address
adaptation in all regions and types of buildings. Retrofitting current
housing stock will be expensive.

The vulnerability of cultural heritage, including monuments/buildings
and cultural landscapes, is an emerging concern. Some cultural
landscapes will disappear. Grape production is highly sensitive to
climate, but production (of grape varieties) is strongly culturally
dependent and adaptation is potentially limited by the regulatory
context.

There is strong evidence that climate change will increase the
distribution and seasonal activity of pests and diseases, and limited
evidence that such effects are already occurring. Increased threats
to plant and animal health are noted. Public policies are in place
to reduce pesticide use in agriculture use and antibiotics in livestock,
and this will increase vulnerability to the impact of climate change
on agriculture and livestock production.

Lack of institutional frameworks is a major barrier to adaptation
governance, in particular, the systematic failure in land use planning
policy to account for climate change.

"*The studies included in this table are those with good evidence of a detection of a long-term trend in the outcome of interest, and where there has been an assessment of the
attribution of the trend to an observed change in climate factor. It is not possible to make an attribution to anthropogenic climate change at this scale; see Chapter 18 for a more
complete discussion.

Little information is available on integrated and cross-sectoral
climate change impacts in Europe, as the impact studies typically
describe a single sector (see Sections 23.3-6). This also includes a
lack of information on cross-sector vulnerabilities, and the indirect
effects of climate change impacts and adaptation responses. This is
a major barrier in developing successful evidence-based adaptation
strategies that are cost-effective.

Climate change impact models are difficult to validate (Sections
23.3-6); proper testing of the characteristics of baseline impact
estimates against baseline information and data would improve
their reliability, or the development of alternative methods where
baseline data are not available.

There is little knowledge on co-benefits and unintended consequences
of adaptation options across a range of sectors (Sections 23.3-6).

"There is a need to better monitor and evaluate local and national
adaptation and mitigation responses to climate change, in both
public and private sectors (Section 23.7; Box 23-3). This includes
policies and strategies—as well as the effectiveness of individual
adaptation measures. Evaluation of adaptation strategies, over a range
of time scales, would better support decision making. Although
some means for reporting of national actions exist in Europe (e.g.,
EU Climate-ADAPT), there is no consistent method of monitoring
or a mechanism for information exchange (Section 23.7).

There are now more economic methods and tools available for the
costing and valuation of specific adaptation options, in particular
for flood defenses, water, energy, and agriculture sectors (Section
23.7.6). However, for other sectors—such as biodiversity, business
and industry, and population health costs—cost estimates are still
lacking or incomplete. The usefulness of this costing information
in decision making needs to be evaluated and research can be
undertaken to make economic evaluation more relevant to decision
making.

The need for local climate information to inform decision making
also needs to be evaluated.

More study of the implications for rural development would inform

"Europe is one of the world’s largest and most productive suppliers of food, but also imports large amounts of some
agricultural commodities. A reduction in crop yields, particularly wheat in Southern Europe, is expected under future
climate scenarios. A shift in cultivation areas of high-value crops, such as grapes for wine, may also occur. Loss of
food production may be compensated by increases in other European sub-regions. However, if the capacity of the
European food production system to sustain climate shock events is exceeded, the region would require exceptional
food importation.
"	Text
"Coastal areas affected by storm surges will face increased risk both because of the increasing frequency of storms
and because of higher sea level. Most of this increase in risk will occur after the middle of this century. Models of
the coast line suggest that populations in the northwestern region of Europe are most affected and many countries,
including the Netherlands, Germany, France, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, and Italy, will need to strengthen their
coastal defenses. Some countries have already raised their coastal defense standards. The combination of raised
sea defenses and coastal erosion may lead to narrower coastal zones in the North Sea, the Iberian coast, and the
Bay of Biscay. Adapting dwellings and commercial buildings to occasional flooding is another response to climate
change. But though adapting buildings in coastal communities and upgrading coastal defenses can significantly
reduce adverse impacts of sea level rise and storm surges, they cannot eliminate these risks, especially as sea levels
will continue to rise over time. In some locations, “managed retreat” is likely to become a necessary response.

"Many factors play a role in the introduction of infectious diseases into new areas. Factors that determine whether
a disease changes distribution include: importation from international travel of people, vectors or hosts (insects,
agricultural products), changes in vector or host susceptibility, drug resistance, and environmental changes, such
as land use change or climate change. One area of concern that has gained attention is the potential for climate
change to facilitate the spread of tropical diseases, such as malaria, into Europe. Malaria was once endemic in
Europe. Even though its mosquito vectors are still present and international travel introduces fresh cases, malaria
has not become established in Europe because infected people are quickly detected and treated. Maintaining good
health surveillance and good health systems are therefore essential to prevent diseases from spreading. When an
outbreak has occurred (i.e., the introduction of a new disease) determining the causes is often difficult. It is likely
that a combination of factors will be important. A suitable climate is a necessary but not a sufficient factor for the
introduction of new infectious diseases.

"A major barrier to research is lack of access to data, which is variable
across regions and countries (especially with respect to socioeconomic
data, climate data, forestry, and routine health data). There is a need
for long-term monitoring of environmental and social indicators and to
ensure open access to data for long-term and sustainable research
programs. Cross-regional cooperation could also ensure compatibility
and consistency of parameters across the European region.

More research is needed on impacts of climate change on transport,
especially on the vulnerability of road and rail infrastructure, and
on the contribution of climatic and non-climatic parameters in the
vulnerability of air transport (e.g., changes in air traffic volumes,
airport capacities, air traffic demand, weather at the airports of
origin, intermediate and final destination; Section 23.3.3).
Improved monitoring of droughts is needed to support the
management of crop production (Section 23.4). Remote sensing could
be complemented by field experiments that assess the combined
effects of elevated CO, and extreme heat and drought on crops and
pastures.

Research is needed on resilience of human populations to extreme
events (factors that increase resilience), including responses to flood
and heat wave risks. Research is also needed on how adaptation
policies may increase or reduce social inequalities (Section 23.5).
Improved risk models need to be developed for vector-borne disease

"Executive Summary
"	Title
"Warming trends and increasing temperature extremes have been observed across most of the Asian region over the past century
(high confidence). {24.3} Increasing numbers of warm days and decreasing numbers of cold days have been observed, with the warming
trend continuing into the new millennium. Precipitation trends including extremes are characterized by strong variability, with both increasing
and decreasing trends observed in different parts and seasons of Asia.
"	Text
"Multiple stresses caused by rapid urbanization, industrialization, and economic development will be compounded by climate
change (high confidence). {24.4-7} Climate change is expected to adversely affect the sustainable development capabilities of most Asian
developing countries by aggravating pressures on natural resources and the environment. Development of sustainable cities in Asia with fewer
fossil fuel-driven vehicles and with more trees and greenery would have a number of co-benefits, including improved public health.
"	Text
"Water scarcity is expected to be a major challenge for most of the region as a result of increased water demand and lack of good
management (medium confidence). {24.4.3} Water resources are important in Asia because of the massive population and vary among
regions and seasons. However, there is /ow confidence in future precipitation projections at a sub-regional scale and thus in future freshwater
availability in most parts of Asia. Population growth and increasing demand arising from higher standards of living could worsen water security
in many parts in Asia and affect many people in the future. Integrated water management strategies could help adapt to climate change,
including developing water-saving technologies, increasing water productivity, and water reuse.
"	Text
"Terrestrial systems in many parts of Asia have responded to recent climate change with shifts in the phenologies, growth rates,
and the distributions of plant species, and with permafrost degradation, and the projected changes in climate during the 21st
century will increase these impacts (high confidence). {24.4.2} Boreal trees will likely invade treeless arctic vegetation, while evergreen
conifers will likely invade deciduous larch forest. Large changes may also occur in arid and semiarid areas, but uncertainties in precipitation
projections make these more difficult to predict. The rates of vegetation change in the more densely populated parts of Asia may be reduced by
the impact of habitat fragmentation on seed dispersal, while the impacts of projected climate changes on the vegetation of the lowland tropics
are currently poorly understood. Changes in animal distributions have also been projected, in response to both direct impacts of climate
change and indirect impacts through changes in the availability of suitable habitats.
"	Text
"Coastal and marine systems in Asia are under increasing stress from both climatic and non-climatic drivers (high confidence).
{24.4.3} It is likely that mean sea level rise will contribute to upward trends in extreme coastal high water levels. {WGI AR5 3.7.6} In the Asiar
Arctic, rising sea levels are expected to interact with projected changes in permafrost and the length of the ice-free season to cause increased
rates of coastal erosion (medium evidence, high agreement). Mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass beds may decline unless they can move
inland, while coastal freshwater swamps and marshes will be vulnerable to saltwater intrusion with rising sea levels. Widespread damage to
coral reefs correlated with episodes of high sea surface temperature has been reported in recent decades and there is high confidence that
damage to reefs will increase during the 21st century as a result of both warming and ocean acidification. Marine biodiversity is expected to
increase at temperate latitudes as warmwater species expand their ranges northward (high confidence), but may decrease in the tropics if
thermal tolerance limits are exceeded (medium confidence).
"	Text
"The impacts of climate change on food production and food security in Asia will vary by region, with many regions to experien
a decline in productivity (medium confidence). {24.4.4} This is evident in the case of rice production. Most models, using a range of
General Circulation Models (GCMs) and Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) scenarios, show that higher temperatures will lead to
lower rice yields as a result of shorter growing periods. There are a number of regions that are already near the heat stress limits for rice.
However, carbon dioxide (CO,) fertilization may at least in part offset yield losses in rice and other crops. In Central Asia, some areas could be
winners (cereal production in northern and eastern Kazakhstan could benefit from the longer growing season, warmer winters, and slight
increase in winter precipitation), while others could be losers (western Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, where frequent droughts could negativ
affect cotton production, increase water demand for irrigation, and exacerbate desertification). In the Indo-Gangetic Plains of South Asia ther
could be a decrease of about 50% in the most favorable and high-yielding wheat area as a result of heat stress at 2 times CO,. Sea level rise
will inundate low-lying areas and will especially affect rice growing regions. Many potential adaptation strategies are being practiced and
proposed but research studies on their effectiveness are still few.
"	Text
"Extreme climate events will have an increasing impact on human health, security, livelihoods, and poverty, with the type and
magnitude of impact varying across Asia (high confidence). {24.4.6} More frequent and intense heat waves in Asia will increase mortality
and morbidity in vulnerable groups. Increases in heavy rain and temperature will increase the risk of diarrheal diseases, dengue fever, and
malaria. Increases in floods and droughts will exacerbate rural poverty in parts of Asia as a result of negative impacts on the rice crop and
resulting increases in food prices and the cost of living.
"	Text
"Studies of observed climate changes and their impacts are still inadequate for many areas, particularly in North, Central, and
West Asia (high confidence). {24.8} Improved projections for precipitation, and thus water supply, are most urgently needed. Understanding
of climate change impacts on ecosystems in Asia is currently limited by the incompleteness and inaccessibility of biodiversity information.
Major research gaps in the tropics include the temperature dependence of carbon fixation by tropical trees and the thermal tolerances and
acclimation capacities of both plants and animals. Interactions between climate change and the direct impacts of rising CO, on crops and natural
ecosystems are also currently poorly understood. More research is needed on impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation in urban settlements,
especially cities with populations of less than 500,000. More generally, there is a need to develop low-cost adaptation measures appropriate to
the least developed parts of the region.

"Major highlights from previous assessments for Asia include:

¢ Warming trends, including higher extremes, are strongest over the
continental interiors of Asia, and warming in the period 1979 onward
was strongest over China in winter, and northern and eastern Asia
in spring and autumn (WGI AR4 Section 3.2.2.7; SREX Section 3.3.1).

"Asia is defined here as the land and territories of 51 countries/regions
(see Figure 24-1). It can be broadly divided into six subregions based on
geographical position and coastal peripheries. These are, in alphabetical
order, Central Asia (5 countries), East Asia (7 countries/regions), North
Asia (2 countries), South Asia (8 countries), Southeast Asia (12 countries),
and West Asia (17 countries). The population of Asia was reported to be
about 4299 million in 2013, which is about 60% of the world population
(UN DESA Population Division, 2013). Population density was reportedly
about 134 per square kilometer in 2012 (PRB, 2012). The highest life
expectancy at birth is 84 Japan) and the lowest is 50 (Afghanistan)
(CIA, 2013). The gross domestic product (GDP) per capita ranged from
US$620 (Afghanistan for 2011) to US$51,709 (Singapore for 2012)
(World Bank, 2013).
"	Text
"From 1900 to 2005, precipitation increased significantly in northern
and central Asia but declined in parts of southern Asia (WGI AR4
SPM).

Future climate change is likely to affect water resource scarcity with
enhanced climate variability and more rapid melting of glaciers
(WGII AR4 Section 10.4.2).

Increased risk of extinction for many plant and animal species in
Asia is likely as a result of the synergistic effects of climate change
and habitat fragmentation (WGII AR4 Section 10.4.4).

Projected sea level rise is very likely to result in significant losses
of coastal ecosystems (WGII AR4 Sections 10.4.3.2, 10.6.1).

There will be regional differences within Asia in the impacts of climate
change on food production (WGIl AR4 Section 10.4.1.1).

Due to projected sea level rise, a million or so people along the
coasts of South and Southeast Asia will likely be at risk from flooding
(high confidence; WGIl AR4 Section 10.4.3.1).

It is likely that climate change will impinge on sustainable development
of most developing countries of Asia as it compounds the pressures
on natural resources and the environment associated with rapid
urbanization, industrialization, and economic development (WGIl
AR4 Section 10.7).

Vulnerabilities of industry, infrastructure, settlements, and society
to climate change are generally greater in certain high-risk
locations, particularly coastal and riverine areas (WGII AR4 Sections
7.3-5).

northern Asian sector (see WGI ARS Section 14.8.8). Over the period
1901-2009, the warming trend was particularly strong in the cold season
between November and March, with an increase of 2.4°C in the mid-
latitude semiarid area of Asia (see WGI ARS Section 14.8.8). Increasing
annual mean temperature trends at the country scale in East and South
Asia have been observed during the 20th century (Table SM24-1). In

"It is very likely that mean annual temperature has increased over the
past century over most of the Asia region, but there are areas of the
interior and at high latitudes where the monitoring coverage is insufficient
for the assessment of trends (see WGI ARS Chapter 2; Figure 24-2). New
analyses continue to support the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) and
IPCC Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and
Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX) conclusions
that it is likely that the numbers of cold days and nights have decreased
and the numbers of warm days and nights have increased across most
of Asia since about 1950, and heat wave frequency has increased since
the middle of the 20th century in large parts of Asia (see WGI ARS Section
2.6.1).

"There is improved country coverage on observed and
future impacts of climate change.

There is an increase in the number of studies reflecting
advances in research tools (e.g., more use of remote
sensing and modeling of impacts), with an evaluation
of detection and attribution where feasible.

More conclusions have confidence statements, while
confidence levels have changed in both directions
since AR4.

Expanded coverage of issues—for example, discussion
of the Himalayas has been expanded to cover observed
and projected impacts (Box 3-2), including those on
tourism (see Section 10.6.2); livelihood assets such as
water and food (Sections 9.3.3.1, 13.3.1.1, 18.5.3,

"Most areas of the Asian region lack sufficient observational records to
draw conclusions about trends in annual precipitation over the past
century (see WGI ARS Chapter 2; Figure 24-2; Table SM24-2). Precipitation
trends, including extremes, are characterized by strong variability, with
both increasing and decreasing trends observed in different parts and
seasons of Asia (see WGI AR5 Chapter 14; Table SM24-2). In northern Asia,
the observations indicate some increasing trends of heavy precipitation
events, but in central Asia, no spatially coherent trends were found (see
WGIARS Section 14.8.8). Both the East Asian summer and winter monsoon
circulations have experienced an inter-decadal scale weakening after the
1970s, due to natural variability of the coupled climate system, leading
to enhanced mean and extreme precipitation along the Yangtze River
valley (30°N), but deficient mean precipitation in North China in summer
(see WGI ARS Section 14.8.9). A weakening of the East Asian summer
monsoon since the 1920s was also found in sea level pressure gradients
(low confidence; see WGI AR5 Section 2.7.4). In West Asia, a weak but
non-significant downward trend in mean precipitation was observed in
recent decades, although with an increase in intense weather events
(see WGI ARS Section 14.8.10). In South Asia, seasonal mean rainfall
shows inter-decadal variability, noticeably a declining trend with more
frequent deficit monsoons under regional inhomogeneities (see WGI AR5S
Section 14.8.11). Over India, the increase in the number of monsoon
break days and the decline in the number of monsoon depressions are
consistent with the overall decrease in seasonal mean rainfall (see
WGI ARS Section 14.8.11). But an increase in extreme rainfall events
occurred at the expense of weaker rainfall events over the central Indian
region and in many other areas (see WGI ARS Section 14.2.2.1). In South
Asia, the frequency of heavy precipitation events is increasing, while
light rain events are decreasing (see WGI ARS Section 14.8.11). In
Southeast Asia, annual total wet-day rainfall has increased by 22 mm
per decade, while rainfall from extreme rain days has increased by 10
mm per decade, but climate variability and trends differ vastly across the
region and between seasons (see WGI ARS Sections 14.4.12, 14.8.12).
In Southeast Asia, between 1955 and 2005 the ratio of rainfall in the
wet to the dry seasons increased. While an increasing frequency of
extreme events has been reported in the northern parts of Southeast
Asia, decreasing trends in such events are reported in Myanmar (see
WGI ARS Section 14.4.12). In Peninsular Malaya during the southwest
monsoon season, total rainfall and the frequency of wet days decreased,
but rainfall intensity increased in much of the region. On the other hand,
during the northeast monsoon, total rainfall, the frequency of extreme
rainfall events, and rainfall intensity all increased over the peninsula
(see WGI ARS Section 14.4.12).

"Future increases in precipitation extremes related to the monsoon are
very likely in East, South, and Southeast Asia (see WGI AR5 Sections
14.2.1, 14.8.9, 14.8.11-12). More than 85% of CMIP5 models show an
increase in mean precipitation in the East Asian summer monsoons, while
more than 95% of models project an increase in heavy precipitation
events (see WGI ARS Section 14.2.2, Figure 14.4). All models and all
scenarios project an increase in both the mean and extreme precipitation
in the Indian summer monsoon (see WGI ARS Section 14.2.2 and Southern
Asia (SAS) in Figure 14.4). In these two regions, the interannual standard
deviation of seasonal mean precipitation also increases (see WGI ARS
Section 14.2.2).

"The future influence of climate change on tropical cyclones is likely to
vary by region, but there is low confidence in region-specific projections
of frequency and intensity. However, better process understanding and
model agreement in specific regions indicate that precipitation will likely
be more extreme near the centers of tropical cyclones making landfall
in West, East, South, and Southeast Asia (see WGI ARS Sections 14.6,
14.8.9-12). There is medium confidence that a projected poleward shift
in the North Pacific storm track of extratropical cyclones is more likely
than not. There is low confidence in the magnitude of regional storm track
changes and the impact of such changes on regional surface climate (see
WGI ARS Section 14.6).

"The AR4 assessed that warming is very likely in the 21st century

"Awarming maximum is observed at 25°N to 65°N with signals extending
to 700 m depth and is consistent with poleward displacement of the
mean temperature field (WGI AR5 Section 3.2.2). The pH measurements
between 1983 and 2008 in the western North Pacific showed a —0.0018
+ 0.0002 yr"" decline in winter and -0.0013 + 0.0005 yr"" decline in
summer (see WGI ARS Section 3.8.2). Over the period 1993-2010, large
rates of sea level rise in the western tropical Pacific were reported,
corresponding to an increase in the strength of the trade winds in the
central and eastern tropical Pacific (see WGI ARS Section 13.6.1). Spatial
variation in trends in Asian regional sea level may also be specific to a
particular sea or ocean basin. For example, a rise of 5.4 + 0.3 mm yr!
in the Sea of Japan from 1993 to 2001 is nearly two times the global
mean sea level (GMSL) trend, with more than 80% of this rise being
thermosteric, and regional changes of sea level in the Indian Ocean that
have emerged since the 1960s are driven by changing surface winds
associated with a combined enhancement of Hadley and Walker cells
(see WGI AR5 Section 13.6.1).

literature and expert judgments, with supporting evaluation of evidence and agreement in the referenced chapter sections. Each key risk is characterized as very low, low,
medium, high, or very high. Risk levels are presented for the near-term era of committed climate change (here, for 2030-2040), in which projected levels of global mean
temperature increase do not diverge substantially across emissions scenarios. Risk levels are also presented for the longer term era of climate options (here, for 2080-2100), for
global mean temperature increase of 2°C and 4°C above pre-industrial levels. For each time frame, risk levels are estimated for the current state of adaptation and for a

hypothetical highly adapted state. As the assessment considers potential impacts on different physical, biological, and human systems, risk levels should not necessarily be used
to evaluate relative risk across key risks. Relevant climate variables are indicated by symbols.

"Given the already very high level of water stress in many parts of Central
Asia, projected temperature increases and precipitation decreases (SRES
scenarios from IPCC AR4, 23 models) in the western part of Kazakhstan,
Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan could exacerbate the problems of water
shortage and distribution (Lioubimtseva and Henebry, 2009). Considering
the dependence of Uzbekistan’s economy on its irrigated agriculture,

strongly affect the economy (Schliiter et al., 2010).

Seetharam, 2008; Lioubimtseva and Henebry, 2009; Siegfried et al., 2010;
Aarnoudse et al., 2012). Unsustainable consumption of groundwater

"Projections (A2 and B2 with the Global Assessment of Security (GLASS)
model) suggest an increase in average water availability in Russia in

Hadley Centre Atmospheric Model version 3H (HadAM3H) A2 and B2
scenarios with the Providing Regional Climates for Impacts Studies
(PRECIS) regional model) suggests that there will be insufficient water
for agriculture in the 2020s and 2040s due to the increases in water
demand for non-agricultural uses, although precipitation may increase
in some areas (Xiong et al., 2010). In the late-21st century (MRI-AGCMs,
A1B), river discharge in northern Japan is projected to increase in
February but decrease in May, due to increased winter precipitation and
decreased spring snowmelt (Sato et al., 2013).
"	Text
"Examples of the options include: developing water saving technologies
in irrigation (Ngoundo et al., 2007); water infrastructure development
in the Ganges river basin (Bharati et al., 2011); increasing water
productivity in the Indus and Ganges river basins (Cai et al., 2010),
Taiwan, China, and the Philippines (Barker and Levine, 2012), and
Uzbekistan (Tischbein et al., 2011); changing cropping systems and
patterns in West Asia (Thomas, 2008); and water reuse in China (Yi et
al., 2011). During the second half of the 20th century, Asia built many
reservoirs and almost tripled its surface water withdrawals for irrigation
(Biemans et al., 2011). Reservoirs partly mitigate seasonal differences
and increase water availability for irrigation (Biemans et al., 2011).
Water management in river basins would benefit from integrated
coordination among countries (Kranz et al., 2010). For example, water
management in the Syr Darya river basin relates to Kyrgyzstan,
Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan (Siegfried et al.,
2010), while the Indus and Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna river basins
concern Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan (Uprety and Salman,
2011).

"Asia is a huge and diverse region, so both climate change and the impact on freshwater resources will vary greatly
depending on location. But throughout the region, adequate water resources are particularly important because
of the massive population and heavy dependence of the agricultural sector on precipitation, river runoff, and
groundwater. Overall, there is low confidence in the projections of specifically how climate change will impact future
precipitation on a sub-regional scale, and thus in projections of how climate change might impact the availability
of water resources. However, water scarcity is expected to be a big challenge in many Asian regions because of
increasing water demand from population growth and consumption per capita with higher standards of living.
Shrinkage of glaciers in central Asia is expected to increase as a result of climate warming, which will influence
downstream river runoff in these regions. Better water management strategies could help ease water scarcity.
Examples include developing water saving technologies in irrigation, building reservoirs, increasing water productivity,
changing cropping systems, and water reuse.

"Biological changes consistent with climate trends have been reported in
the north and at high altitudes, where rising temperatures have relaxed
constraints on plant growth and the distributions of organisms. Few
changes have been reported from tropical lowlands and none linked to
climate change with high confidence, although data are insufficient to
distinguish lack of observations from lack of impacts. Impacts on inland
water systems have been difficult to disentangle from natural variability
and other human impacts (Bates et al., 2008; Vordsmarty et al., 2010;
Zheng, 2011; see Section 4.3.3.3). For example, the shrinking of the Aral
Sea over the last 50 years has resulted largely from excessive water
extraction from rivers, but was probably exacerbated by decreasing
precipitation and increasing temperature (Lioubimtseva and Henebry,

"Tree-ring data for 800-1989 for temperate East Asia suggests recent
summer temperatures have exceeded those during past warm periods

"(>60°N) show considerable spatial and temporal variability, despite a
consistent warming trend, reflecting water availability and non-climatic

increased greening since 1982, while boreal forests were variable (Goetz
et al., 2011; de Jong et al., 2012; Epstein et al., 2012; Xu et al, 2013).
An overall greening trend for 2000-2011 north of the boreal forest
correlated with increasing summer warmth and ice retreat (Dutrieux et
al., 2012). In China, trends have varied in space and time, reflecting
positive impacts of warming and negative impacts of increasing drought
stress (Peng et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2012). The steppe
region of northern Kazakhstan showed an overall browning (decreasing
NDVI) trend for 1982-2008, linked to declining precipitation (de Jong et
al., 2012). In Central Asia, where NDVI is most sensitive to precipitation
(Gessner et al., 2013), there was a heterogeneous pattern for 1982—
2009, with an initial greening trend stalled or reversed in some areas
(Mohammat et al., 2013).

"In humid temperate East Asia, plant observations and satellite
measurements of “greenness” (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
(NDVI); see Section 4.3.2.2) show a trend to earlier leafing in spring
since the 1980s, averaging 2 days per decade, although details vary
between sites, species, and periods (Table SM24-6; detected with high
confidence and attributed to warming with medium confidence). Earlier
spring flowering and delayed autumn senescence have also been
recorded (Table SM24-6). Trends in semiarid temperate regions were
heterogeneous in space and time (Liu et al., 2013a; Yu, Z. et al., 2013a,b).
Earlier greening has been reported from boreal forests (Delbart et al.,
2008) and from the Hindu-Kush-Himalayan region (Panday and Ghimire,
2012; Shrestha et al., 2012), but with spatial and temporal heterogeneity.
Patterns were also heterogeneous in Central Asia (Kariyeva et al., 2012).
On the Tibetan Plateau, spring growth advanced until the mid-1990s,
but the trend subsequently differs between areas and NDVI data sets
(Yu et al., 2010, 2012; Dong et al., 2013; Jin et al, 2013; Shen et al.,

needle conifers (DNCs) and birch have invaded larch-dominated forest
over the last 3 decades (Kharuk et al., 2010c,d; Osawa et al., 2010; Lloyd

are expected to continue in humid temperate and boreal forest areas,
although photoperiod or chilling requirements may reduce responses
to warming in some species (Ge et al., 2013; Hadano et al., 2013;
Richardson et al., 2013). Changes in precipitation will be important for
semiarid and arid ecosystems, as may the direct impacts of atmospheric
carbon dioxide (CO,) concentrations, making responses harder to predict
(Liancourt et al., 2012; Poulter et al., 2013). The “general flowering” at
multi-year intervals in lowland rainforests in Southeast Asia is triggered
by irregular droughts (Sakai et al., 2006), so changes in drought frequency

formed during the Little Ice Age is thawing at many locations and Late
Holocene permafrost has begun to thaw at some undisturbed locations
in northwest Siberia. Permafrost thawing is most noticeable within the
discontinuous permafrost zone, while continuous permafrost is starting
to thaw in a few places, so the boundary between continuous and
discontinuous permafrost is moving northward (Romanovsky et al.,

"In East Asia, subtropical evergreen forests are projected to expand north
into the deciduous forest and tropical forests to expand along China's
southern coast (Choi et al., 2011; Wang, 2013), but vegetation change
may lag climate change by decades or centuries (Corlett and Westcott,
2013). On the Tibetan Plateau, projections suggest that alpine vegetation
will be largely replaced by forest and shrubland, with tundra and steppe
retreating to the north (Liang et al., 2012; Wang, 2013). Impacts in
Central and West Asia will depend on changes in precipitation. In
India, a dynamic vegetation model (A2 and B2 scenarios) projected
changes in more than a third of the forest area by 2100, mostly from
deciduous to evergreen forest in response to increasing rainfall,
although fragmentation and other human pressures are expected to
slow these changes (Chaturvedi et al., 2011). By 2100, large areas of
tropical and subtropical lowland Asia are projected to experience
combinations of temperature and rainfall outside the current global range,
under a variety of model projections and emission scenarios (Williams
et al, 2007; Beaumont et al., 2010; Garcia-Lopez and Allué, 2013), but
the potential impacts of these novel conditions on biodiversity are
largely unknown (Corlett, 2011).

"Thawing permafrost may lead to increasing emissions of greenhouse
gases from decomposition of accumulated organic matter (see Sections
4.3.3.4, 19.6.3.5). In Mongolia, mean annual permafrost temperature
at 10 to 15 m depth increased over the past 10 to 40 years in the
Hovsgol, Hangai, and Hentei Mountain regions. Permafrost warming
during the past 15 to 20 years was greater than during the previous 15
to 20 years (Sharkhuu et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2010). In the Kazakh part
of the Tien Shan Mountains, permafrost temperature and active layer
thickness have increased since the early 1970s. Significant permafrost
warming also occurred in the eastern Tien Shan Mountains, in the
headwaters of the Urumqi River (Marchenko et al., 2007; Zhao et al.,
2010). Monitoring across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau over recent decades
has also revealed permafrost degradation caused by warming and other
impacts. Areas of permafrost are shrinking, the active layer depth is
increasing, the lower altitudinal limit is rising, and the seasonal frost
depth is thinning (Li et al., 2008; Wu and Zhang, 2010; Zhao et al., 2010).
In the alpine headwater regions of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, rising
temperatures and permafrost degradation have resulted in lower lake
levels, drying swamps, and shrinking grasslands (Cheng and Wu, 2007;
Wang et al., 2011).

"Climate change is expected to modify the vegetation distribution across
the region (Tao and Zhang, 2010; Wang, 2013), but responses will be
slowed by limitations on seed dispersal, competition from established
plants, rates of soil development, and habitat fragmentation (high
confidence; Corlett and Westcott, 2013). Rising CO, concentrations are
expected to favor increased woody vegetation in semiarid areas
(medium confidence; Higgins and Scheiter, 2012; Donohue et al., 2013;
Poulter et al., 2013; Wang, 2013). In North Asia, rising temperatures are
expected to lead to large changes in the distribution of potential natural
ecosystems (high confidence; Ni, 2011; Tchebakova et al., 2011; Insarov
et al., 2012; Pearson et al., 2013). It is /ikely that the boreal forest will
expand northward and eastward, and that tundra will decrease,
although differences in models, time periods, and other assumptions
have resulted in widely varying projections for the magnitude of this
change (Woodward and Lomas, 2004; Kaplan and New, 2006; Lucht et
al., 2006; Golubyatnikov and Denisenko, 2007; Sitch et al., 2008;
Korzukhin and Tcelniker, 2010; Tchebakova et al., 2010, 2011; Pearson
et al., 2013). Boreal forest expansion and the continued invasion of the
existing larch-dominated forest by DNCs could lead to larch reaching
the Arctic shore, while the traditional area of larch dominance turns into
mixed forest (Kharuk et al., 2006, 2010c). Both the replacement of
summer-green larch with evergreen conifers and expansion of trees and
shrubs into tundra decrease albedo, causing regional warming and
potentially accelerating vegetation change (Kharuk et al., 2006, 2010d;
McGuire et al., 2007; Pearson et al., 2013). The future direction and rate
of change of steppe vegetation are unclear because of uncertain
precipitation trends (Golubyatnikov and Denisenko, 2007; Tchebakova
et al., 2010). The role of CO, fertilization is also potentially important
here (Poulter et al., 2013; see WGI AR5 Box 6.3).

"Climate change impacts on inland waters will interact with dam
construction, pollution, and land use changes (Vordsmarty et al., 2010;
see also Sections 3.3.2, 24.9.1). Increases in water temperature will
impact species- and temperature-dependent processes (Hamilton, 2010;
Dudgeon, 2011, 2012). Coldwater fish will be threatened as rising water
temperatures make much of their current habitat unsuitable (Yu, D. et
al., 2013). Climate change is also expected to change flow regimes in
running waters and consequently impact habitats and species that are
sensitive to droughts and floods (see Box CC-RF). Habitats that depend
on seasonal inundation, including floodplain grasslands and freshwater
swamp forests, will be particularly vulnerable (Maxwell, 2009; Bezuijen,
2011; Arias et al., 2012). Reduced dry season flows are expected to
combine with sea level rise to increase saltwater intrusion in deltas
(Hamilton, 2010; Dudgeon, 2012), although non-climatic impacts will
continue to dominate in most estuaries (Syvitski et al., 2009). For most
Asian lakes, it is difficult to disentangle the impacts of water pollution,
hydro-engineering, and climate change (Battarbee et al., 2012).

"Suggested strategies for maximizing the adaptive capacity of ecosystems
include reducing non-climate impacts, maximizing landscape connectivity,
and protecting “refugia” where climate change is expected to be less than
the regional mean (Hannah, 2010; Game et al., 2011; Klorvuttimontara
et al., 2011; Murthy et al., 2011; Ren et al., 2011; Shoo et al., 2011;
Mandych et al., 2012). Additional options for inland waters include
operating dams to maintain environmental flows for biodiversity,
protecting catchments, and preserving river floodplains (Vordsmarty et
al., 2010). Habitat restoration may facilitate species movements across
climatic gradients (Klorvuttimontara et al., 2011; Hughes et al., 2012) and
long-distance seed dispersal agents may need protection (McConkey et
al., 2012). Assisted migration of genotypes and species is possible where
movements are constrained by poor dispersal, but risks and benefits
need to be considered carefully (Liu et al., 2010; Olden et al., 2010;
Tchebakova et al., 2011; Dudgeon, 2012; Ishizuka and Goto, 2012;

"et al., 2011; Jump et al., 2012; Tanaka, N. et al., 2012; Davydov et al.,
2013). Many freshwater habitats are similarly isolated and their
restricted-range species may be equally vulnerable (Dudgeon, 2012). In
flatter topography, higher velocities of climate change (the speeds that
species need to move to maintain constant climate conditions) increase
the vulnerabilities of species that are unable to keep pace, as a result
of limited dispersal ability, habitat fragmentation, or other non-climatic
constraints (Corlett and Westcott, 2013). In the tropics, temperature
extremes above the present range are a potential threat to organisms
and ecosystems (Corlett, 2011; Jevanandam et al., 2013; Mumby et al.,
2013). For much of interior Asia, increases in drought stress, as a result
of declining rainfall and/or rising temperatures, are the key concern.
Because aridity is projected to increase in the northern Mongolian forest
belt during the 21st century (Sato et al., 2007), larch cover will likely be
reduced (Dulamsuren et al., 2010a). In the boreal forest region, a longer,
warmer growing season will increase vulnerability to fires, although
other human influences may overshadow climate impacts in accessible
areas (Flannigan et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013; see Section
4,3.3.1.1). If droughts intensify in lowland Southeast Asia, the synergies
between warmth, drought, logging, fragmentation, and fire (Daniau et
al., 2012) and tree mortality (Kumagai and Porporato, 2012; Tan et al.,
2013), possibly acerbated by feedbacks between deforestation, smoke
aerosols, and reduced rainfall (Aragao, 2012; Tosca et al., 2012), could
greatly increase the vulnerability of fragmented forest landscapes (high

only for coral reefs, where the temporal and spatial patterns of bleaching
correlate with higher than normal sea surface temperatures (very high
confidence; Section 5.4.2.4; Box CC-CR). Increased water temperatures
may also explain declines in large seaweed beds in temperate Japan
(Nagai et al, 2011; Section 5.4.2.3). Warming coastal waters have also

macroalgae and toxic phytoplankton (Nagai et al., 2011), fish (Tian et

"Future rates of sea level rise are expected to exceed those of recent
decades (see WGI ARS Section 13.5.1), increasing coastal flooding,

with rising sea levels (Brown et al., 2011; Villanoy et al., 2012; see

and seagrass beds will decline, unless they receive sufficient fresh
sediment to keep pace or they can move inland (Gilman et al., 2008;

poleward expansion of mangrove ecosystems (see Section 5.4.2.3).
Coastal freshwater wetlands may be vulnerable to saltwater intrusion
with rising sea levels, but in most river deltas local subsidence for non-
climatic reasons will be more important (Syvitski et al., 2009). Current
trends in cyclone frequency and intensity are unclear (Section 24.3.2;

"The connectivity of marine habitats and dispersal abilities of marine
organisms increase the capacity for autonomous (spontaneous) adaptation
in coastal systems (Cheung et al., 2009). Creating marine protected
areas where sea surface temperatures are projected to change least
may increase their future resilience (Levy and Ban, 2013). For coral reefs,
potential indicators of future resilience include later projected onset of
annual bleaching conditions (van Hooidonk et al., 2013), past temperature
variability, the abundance of heat-tolerant coral species, coral recruitment
rates, connectivity, and macroalgae abundance (McClanahan et al.,
2012). Similar strategies may help identify reefs that are more resilient
to acidification (McLeod et al., 2013). Hard coastal defenses, such as
sea walls, protect settlements at the cost of preventing adjustments
by mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass beds to rising sea levels.
Landward buffer zones that provide an opportunity for future inland
migration could mitigate this problem (Tobey et al., 2010). More
generally, maintaining or restoring natural shorelines where possible is
expected to provide coastal protection and other benefits (Tobey et al.,

eastern Kazakhstan could benefit from the longer growing season,
warmer winters, and a slight increase in winter precipitation), while others
could be losers (particularly western Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, where
frequent droughts could negatively affect cotton production, increase
already extremely high water demands for irrigation, and exacerbate
the already existing water crisis and human-induced desertification). In
India, the Indo-Gangetic Plains are under threat of a significant reduction

Climate projections based on a doubling of CO, using a CCM3 model

Fish production is also a vital component of regional livelihoods, with

"Rice is a key staple crop in Asia and 90% or more of the world’s rice
production is from Asia. An Asia-wide study revealed that climate
change scenarios (using 18 GCMs for A1B, 14 GCMs for A2, and 17 GCMs
for B1) would reduce rice yield over a large portion of the continent
(Masutomi et al., 2009). The most vulnerable regions were western
Japan, eastern China, the southern part of the Indochina peninsula, and
the northern part of South Asia. In Russia, climate change may also lead
to “food production shortfall,” which was defined as an event in which
the annual potential (i.e., climate-related) production of the most
important crops in an administrative region in a specific year falls below
50% of its climate-normal (1961-1990) average (Alcamo et al., 2007).
The study shows that the frequency of shortfalls in five or more of the
main crop growing regions in the same year is around 2 years per
decade under normal climate but could climb to 5 to 6 years per decade
in the 2070s, depending on the scenario and climate model (using
the GLASS, Global Agro-Ecological Zones (GAEZ), and Water-Global
Assessment and Prognosis (WaterGAP-2) models and ECHAM and
HadCM3 under the A2 and B2 scenarios). The increasing shortfalls were
attributed to severe droughts. The study estimated that the number of
people living in regions that may experience one or more shortfalls
each decade may grow to 82 to 139 million in the 2070s. Increasing
frequency of extreme climate events will pose an increasing threat to
the security of Russia's food system.

"Inland fisheries will continue to be vulnerable to a wide range of ongoing
threats, including overfishing, habitat loss, water abstraction, drainage
of wetlands, pollution, and dam construction, making the impacts of
climate change hard to detect (see also Section 24.9.1). Most concerns
have centered on rising water temperatures and the potential impacts
of climate change on flow regimes, which in turn are expected to affect
the reproduction of many fish species (Allison et al., 2009; Barange and
Perry, 2009; Bezuijen, 2011; Dudgeon, 2011; see also Section 24.4.2.3).
Sea level rise is expected to impact both capture fisheries and aquaculture
production in river deltas (De Silva and Soto, 2009). For marine capture
fisheries, Cheung et al. (2009, 2010) used a dynamic bioclimate envelope
model to project the distributions of 1066 species of exploited marine
fish and invertebrates for 2005-2055, based on the SRES A1B scenario
and a stable-2000 CO, scenario. This analysis suggests that climate
change may lead to a massive redistribution of fisheries catch potential,
with large increases in high-latitude regions, including Asian Russia,
and large declines in the tropics, particularly Indonesia. Other studies
have made generally similar predictions, with climate change impacts
on marine productivity expected to be large and negative in the tropics,
in part because of the vulnerability of coral reefs to both warming and
ocean acidification (see also Section 24.4.3.3), and large and positive
in Arctic and sub-Arctic regions, because of sea ice retreat and poleward
species shifts (high confidence; Sumaila et al, 2011; Blanchard et al., 2012;
Doney et al., 2012). Predictions of a reduction in the average maximum
body weight of marine fishes by 14 to 24% by 2050 under a high-emission
scenario are an additional threat to fisheries (Cheung et al., 2013).

extreme events are expected to be more catastrophic in nature for the

"Floods, droughts, and changes in seasonal rainfall patterns are expected
to negatively impact crop yields, food security, and livelihoods in
vulnerable areas (Dawe et al., 2008; Kelkar et al., 2008; Douglas, 2009).
Rural poverty in parts of Asia could be exacerbated (Skoufias et al.,
2011) as a result of impacts on the rice crop and increases in food prices
and the cost of living (Hertel et al., 2010; Rosegrant, 2011). The poverty
impacts of climate change will be heterogeneous among countries and
social groups (see Table SM24-5). In a low crop productivity scenario,
producers in food exporting countries, such as Indonesia, the Philippines,
and Thailand, would benefit from global food price rises and reduce
poverty, while countries such as Bangladesh would experience a net
increase in poverty of approximately 15% by 2030 (Hertel et al., 2010).
These impacts will also differ within food exporting countries, with
disproportionate negative impacts on farm laborers and the urban poor.
Skoufias et al. (2011) project significant negative impacts of a rainfall
shortfall on the welfare of rice farmers in Indonesia, compared to a
delay in rainfall onset. These impacts may lead to global mass migration
and related conflicts (Laczko and Aghazarm, 2009; Barnett and Webber,

"An estimated 51% of total income in rural Asia comes from non-farm
sources (Haggblade et al., 2009, 2010), mostly local non-farm business
and employment. The contribution of remittances to rural income has
grown steadily (Estudillo and Otsuka, 2010). Significant improvements
have been made in poverty eradication over the past decade (World
Bank, 2007), with rapid reductions in poverty in East Asia, followed
by South Asia (IFAD, 2010). A significant part of the reduction has
come from population shifts, rapid growth in agriculture, and urban
contributions lanvry and Sadoulet, 2010). Climate change negatively
impacts livelihoods (see Table SM24-4) and these impacts are directly
related to natural resources affected by changes in weather and climate.
Factors that have made agriculture less sustainable in the past include
input non-responsive yields, soil erosion, natural calamities, and water
and land quality related problems (Dev, 2011). These have predisposed
rural livelihoods to climate change vulnerability. Livelihoods are impacted
by droughts (Selvaraju et al., 2006; Harshita, 2013), floods (Nguyen,
2007; Keskinen et al., 2010; Nuorteva et al., 2010; Dun, 2011), and
typhoons (Huigen and Jens, 2006; Gaillard et al., 2007; Uy et al., 2011).
Drought disproportionately impacts small farmers, agricultural laborers,
and small businessmen (Selvaraju et al., 2006), who also have least
access to rural safety net mechanisms, including financial services (IFAD,
2010), despite recent developments in microfinance services in parts of
Asia. Past floods have exposed conditions such as lack of access to
alternative livelihoods, difficulty in maintaining existing livelihoods, and
household debts leading to migration in the Mekong region (Dun, 2011).
Similar impacts of repeated floods leading to perpetual vulnerability
were found in the Tonle Sap Lake area of Cambodia (Nuorteva et al.,
2010; Keskinen et al., 2010). Typhoon impacts are mainly through
damage to the livelihood assets of coastal populations in the Philippines
and the level of ownership of livelihood assets has been a major
determinant of vulnerability (Uy et al., 2011).

"Key vulnerabilities vary widely within the region. Climate change can
exacerbate current socioeconomic and political disparities and add
to the vulnerability of Southeast Asia and Central Asia to security
threats that may be transnational in nature (Jasparro and Taylor, 2008;
Lioubimtseva and Henebry, 2009). Apart from detrimental impacts of
extreme events, vulnerability of livelihoods in agrarian communities also
arises from geographic settings, demographic trends, socioeconomic factors,
access to resources and markets, unsustainable water consumption,
farming practices, and lack of adaptive capacity (Acosta-Michlik and
Espaldon, 2008; Allison et al., 2009; Byg and Salick, 2009; Lioubimtseva
and Henebry, 2009; Salick and Ross, 2009; Salick et al., 2009; UN DESA
Statistics Division, 2009; Xu et al., 2009; Knox et al., 2011; Mulligan et
al., 2011). Urban wage laborers were found to be more vulnerable to
cost of living related poverty impacts of climate change than those who
directly depend on agriculture for their livelihoods (Hertel et al., 2010).
In Indonesia, drought-associated fires increase vulnerability of agriculture,
forestry, and human settlements, particularly in peatland areas (Murdiyarso
and Lebel, 2007). Human health is also a major area of focus for Asia
(Munslow and O'Dempsey, 2010), where the magnitude and type of health
effects from climate change depend on differences in socioeconomic and
demographic factors, health systems, the natural and built environment,
land use changes, and migration, in relation to local resilience and adaptive
capacity. The role of institutions is also critical, particularly in influencing
vulnerabilities arising from gender (Ahmed and Fajber, 2009), caste and
ethnic differences (Jones and Boyd, 2011), and securing climate-sensitive
livelihoods in rural areas (Agrawal and Perrin, 2008).

decade (e.g., Karim and Mimura, 2008; Pal and Al-Tabbaa, 2009),
various downscaled tools to support, formulate, and implement climate

One of the major tools is vulnerability assessment and policy option
identification with Geographical Information Systems (GIS). These tools
are expected to be of assistance in assessing city-specific adaptation
options by examining estimated impacts and identified vulnerability for
some coastal cities and areas in Asian countries (e.g., Brouwer et al.,
2007; Taylor, 2011; Storch and Downes, 2011). These tools and systems
sometimes take the form of integration of top-down approaches and
bottom-up (community-based) approaches (see Section 14.5). Whereas
top-down approaches give scientific knowledge to local actors,
community-based approaches are built on existing knowledge and
expertise to strengthen coping and adaptive capacity by involving local
actors (van Aalst et al., 2008). Community-based approaches may have
a limitation in that they place greater responsibility on the shoulders of
local people without necessarily increasing their capacity proportionately
(Allen, 2006). As the nature of adaptive capacity varies depending
on the formulation of social capital and institutional context in the
local community, it is essential for the approaches to be based on an
understanding of local community structures (Adger, 2003).

"Climate change challenges fundamental elements in social and economic
policy goals such as prosperity, growth, equity, and sustainable development
(Mearns and Norton, 2010). Economic, social, and environmental equity
is an enduring challenge in many parts of Asia. Generally, the level of
wealth (typically GDP) has been used as a measure of human vulnerability
of a country but this approach has serious limitations (Dellink et al., 2009;
Mattoo and Subramanian, 2012). In many cases, social capital—an
indicator of equity in income distribution within countries—is a more
important factor in vulnerability and resilience than GDP per capita (Islam
et al., 2006; Lioubimtseva and Henebry, 2009). Furthermore, political
and institutional instabilities can undermine the influence of economic
development (Lioubimtseva and Henebry, 2009). Poor and vulnerable
countries are at greater risk of inequity and loss of livelihoods from the
impacts of climate extremes as their options for coping with such events
are limited. Many factors contribute to this limitation, including poverty,
illiteracy, weak institutions and infrastructures, poor access to resources,
information and technology, poor health care, and low investment and
management capabilities. The overexploitation of land resources including
forests, increases in population, desertification, and land degradation pose
additional threats (UNDP, 2006). This is particularly true for developing
countries in Asia with a high level of natural resource dependency.
Provision of adequate resources based on the burden sharing and the
equity principle will serve to strengthen appropriate adaptation policies

"Forests and their management are also often emphasized for providing
resilient livelihoods and reducing poverty (Chhatre and Agrawal, 2009;

resources is essential for greater livelihood benefits for poor indigenous

schemes to respect and promote community forest tenure rights has been
emphasized (Angelsen, 2009). It has been suggested that indigenous
people can provide a bridge between biodiversity protection and climate

be missing in the current discourse on ecosystem-based adaptation.
There are arguments against REDD+ supporting poverty reduction due
to its inability to promote productive use of forests, which may keep
communities in perpetual poverty (Campbell, 2009), but there is a
contrasting view that REDD+ can work in forests managed for timber

development assistance, where donor agencies and international financial
institutions have made significant steps toward taking climate change
adaptation into account in their loan and grant making processes
(Gigli and Agrawala, 2007; Klein et al., 2007). Although some practical
experiences of adaptation in Asia at the regional, national, and
local level are emerging, there can be barriers that impede or limit
adaptation. These include challenges related to competing national
priorities, awareness and capacity, financial resources for adaptation
implementation, institutional barriers, biophysical limits to ecosystem
adaptation, and social and cultural factors (Lasco et al., 2009, 2012;
Moser and Ekstrom, 2010). Issues with resource availability might not
only result from climate change, but also from weak governance
mechanisms and the breakdown of policy and regulatory structures,
especially with common-pool resources (Moser and Ekstrom, 2010).
Furthermore, the impact of climate change depends on the inherent
vulnerability of the socio-ecological systems in a region as much as on
the magnitude of the change (Evans, 2010). Recent studies linking
climate-related resource scarcities and conflict call for enhanced

"Integrated approaches are often needed when developing mitigation-
adaptation synergies, as seen in waste-to-compost projects in Bangladesh
(Ayers and Huq, 2009). Other adaptation measures that increase
biomass and/or soil carbon content, such as ecosystem protection and
reforestation, will also contribute to climate mitigation by carbon
sequestration. However, exotic monocultures may fix more carbon than
native mixtures while supporting less biodiversity and contributing less
to ecological services, calling for compromises that favor biodiversity-
rich carbon storage (Diaz et al., 2009). The potential for both adaptation
and mitigation through forest restoration is greatest in the tropics
(Sasaki et al., 2011). At higher latitudes (>45°N), reforestation can have
a net warming influence by reducing surface albedo (Anderson-Teixeira
et al., 2012). Expansion of biofuel crops on abandoned and marginal
agricultural lands could potentially make a large contribution to
mitigation of carbon emissions from fossil fuels, but could also have
large negative consequences for both carbon and biodiversity if it results
directly or indirectly in the conversion of carbon-rich ecosystems to
cropland (Fargione et al., 2010; Qin et al., 2011). Mechanisms, such as
Reduction of Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation
(REDD-+), that put an economic price on land use emissions, could
reduce the risks of such negative consequences (Thomson et al., 2010),
but the incentive structures need to be worked out very carefully (Busch

<2.5 ym (PM, 5) (Markandya et al., 2009); policies to increase public
transportation, promote walking and cycling, and reduce private cars
that will increase air quality and decrease the health burden, particularly
in urban environments as projected in India (Woodcock et al., 2009);
and abandoning the use of biomass fuel or coal for indoor cooking and
heating to improve indoor air quality and respiratory and cardiac health
among, in particular, women and children in India and China (Wilkinson

health issues may often have beneficial mitigation effects, like traffic
emissions reduction programs in China (Wu et al., 2011) and India
(Reynolds and Kandikar, 2008).

"Floods and droughts are predominant causes for internal displacement
(IDMC, 2011). In 2010 alone, 38.3 million people were internally displaced:
85% because of hydrological hazards and 77% in Asia. Floods are
increasingly playing a role in migration in the Mekong Delta (Warner,
2010). Often some migrants return to the vulnerable areas (Piguet, 2008)
giving rise to ownership, rights of use, and other issues (Kolmannskog,
2008). Increasing migration has led to increasing migration-induced
remittances contributing to Asian economies, but has had negligible
effect on the poverty rate (Vargas-Silva et al., 2009). In Bangladesh,
migrant workers live and work under poor conditions, such as crowded
shelters, inadequate sanitation, conflict and competition with the local
population, and exploitation (Penning-Rowsell et al., 2011). Forced
migration can result from adaptation options such as construction of
dams, but the negative outcomes could be allayed by putting proper
safeguards in place (Penning-Rowsell et al., 2011). Managed retreat of
coastal communities is a suggested option to address projected sea
level rise (Alexander et al., 2012). A favorable approach to deal with
migration is within a development framework and through adaptation
strategies (Penning-Rowsell et al., 2011; ADB, 2012).

"Studies of observed climate changes and their impacts are still inadequate
for many areas, particularly in North, Central, and West Asia (Table 24-2).
Improved projections for precipitation, and thus water supply, are most
urgently needed. Another priority is developing water management
strategies for adaptation to changes in demand and supply. More research
is also needed on the health effects of changes in water quality and
quantity. Understanding of climate change impacts on ecosystems and
biodiversity in Asia is currently limited by the poor quality and low
accessibility of biodiversity information (UNEP, 2012). National biodiversity
inventories are incomplete and few sites have the baseline information
needed to identify changes. For the tropics, major research gaps include
the temperature dependence of carbon fixation by tropical trees, the
thermal tolerances and acclimation capacities of both plants and animals,
and the direct impacts of rising CO, (Corlett, 2011; Zuidema et al., 2013).
Rising CO, is also expected to be important in cool-arid ecosystems,
where lack of experimental studies currently limits ability to make
predictions (Poulter et al., 2013). Boreal forest dynamics will be influenced
by complex interactions between rising temperatures and CO,,
permafrost thawing, forest fires, and insect outbreaks (Osawa et al.,
2010; Zhang et al, 2011), and understanding this complexity will require
enhanced monitoring of biodiversity and species ranges, improved
modeling, and greater knowledge of species biology (Meleshko and
Semenov, 2008).

(Paul et al., 2009). Increasing regional collaboration in scientific research

impacts on water, biodiversity, and livelihoods in the Himalayan region
(Xu et al., 2009) and could be considered elsewhere. The literature
suggests that work must begin now on building understanding of the
impacts of climate change and moving forward with the most cost-

"The glaciers have therefore been a diminishing store of water, and the
diminution is projected to continue. Paradoxically, this implies more
meltwater, possibly explaining limited observations of increased runoff
(Sorg et al., 2012), but also an eventual decrease of meltwater yield
(see Section 3.4.4). More immediately, it entails a hazard due to the
formation of moraine-dammed glacial lakes (Bolch et al., 2011).

606,000 km? across the countries of Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and
Vietnam. More than 60 million people are heavily reliant on natural
resources, in particular agriculture and fisheries, for their well-being
(MRC, 2009; UNEP, 2010; Figure SM24-2). Thailand and Vietnam produced
51% of the world’s rice exports in 2008, mostly in the LMB (Mainuddin

"Observations of climate change over the past 30 to 50 years in the LMB
include an increase in temperature, an increase in rainfall in the wet
season and decreases in the dry season, intensified flood and drought
events, and sea level rise (ICEM, 2010; IRG, 2010). Agricultural output
has been noticeably impacted by intensified floods and droughts which
caused almost 90% of rice production losses in Cambodia during 1996—
2001 (Brooks and Adger, 2003; MRC, 2009).Vietnam and Cambodia are

of Tien Shan glaciers for an 8°C temperature increase accompanied by
a 24% precipitation increase, but probable complete disappearance of
glaciers if precipitation decreased by 16%; a more moderate 2°C
increase led to little loss, but only if accompanied by a 24% precipitation
increase, Drawing on CMIP5 simulations, Radi¢ et al. (2013) simulated

"National climate change adaptation plans have been formulated in all
four LMB countries, but transboundary adaptation planning across the
LMB does not exist to date. Effective future transboundary adaptation

coordination among adaptation stakeholders and sharing of best
practices across countries; mainstreaming climate change adaptation into
national and sub-national development plans with proper translation
from national adaptation strategies into local action plans; integration

"Existing studies about future climate impacts in the Mekong Basin broadly
share a set of common themes (MRC, 2009; Murphy and Sampson,
2013): increased temperature and annual precipitation; increased depth
and duration of flood in the Mekong Delta and Cambodia floodplain;
prolonged agricultural drought in the south and the east of the basin;
and sea level rise and salinity intrusion in the Mekong delta. Hydropower
dams along the Mekong River and its tributaries will also have severe
impacts on fish productivity and biodiversity, by blocking critical fish
migration routes, altering the habitat of non-migratory fish species, and
reducing nutrient flows downstream (Costanza et al., 2011; Baran and
Guerin, 2012; Ziv et al., 2012). Climate impacts, though less severe than
the impact of dams, will exacerbate these changes (Wyatt and Baird,
2007; Grumbine et al., 2012; Orr et al., 2012; Rasdnen et al., 2012; Ziv
et al., 2012).

"In the late 20th century, central Asian glaciers occupied 31,628 km?
(Dolgushin and Osipova, 1989). All recent basin-scale studies document
multi-decadal area loss (see Figure 24-3); where multiple surveys are
available, most show accelerating loss. The rate of glacier area change
varies (Table SM24-9). Rates between —0.05% yr! and -0.76% yr
have been reported in the Altai (Surazakov et al., 2007; Shahgedanova
et al., 2010; Yao, X.-J. et al., 2012) and Tien Shan (Lettenmaier et al.,
2009; Sorg et al., 2012), and between —0.13% yr! and—0.30% yr"" in
the Pamir (Konovalov and Desinov, 2007; Aizen, 2011a,b,c; Yao, X.-J. et
al., 2012). These ranges reflect varying sub-regional distributions of
glacier size (smaller glaciers shrink faster) and debris cover (which
retards shrinkage), but also varying proportions of ice at high altitudes,
where as yet warming has produced little increase in melt (Narama et
al., 2010).

"Some sectors in some locations have the potential to benefit from projected changes in climate and increasing atmospheric CO,
(high confidence). Examples include reduced winter mortality (low confidence), reduced energy demand for winter heating in New Zealand
and southern parts of Australia, and forest growth in cooler regions except where soil nutrients or rainfall are limiting. Spring pasture growth in
cooler regions would also increase and be beneficial for animal production if it can be utilized. {25.7.1-2, 25.7.4, 25.8.1}
"	Text
"The regional climate is changing (very high confidence). The region continues to demonstrate long-term trends toward higher surface air
and sea surface temperatures, more hot extremes and fewer cold extremes, and changed rainfall patterns. Over the past 50 years, increasing

greenhouse gas concentrations have contributed to rising average temperature in Australia (high confidence) and New Zealand (medium
confidence) and decreasing rainfall in southwestern Australia (high confidence). {25.2; Table 25-1}
"	Text
"Uncertainty in projected rainfall changes remains large for many parts of Australia and New Zealand, which creates significant
challenges for adaptation. For example, projections for average annual runoff in far southeastern Australia range from little change to a
40% decline for 2°C global warming above current levels. The dry end of these scenarios would have severe implications for agriculture, rural
livelihoods, ecosystems, and urban water supply, and would increase the need for transformational adaptation (high confidence). {25.2, 25.5.1,
25.6.1, 25.7.2; Boxes 25-2, 25-5}
"	Text
"Without adaptation, further changes in climate, atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO,), and ocean acidity are projected to have
substantial impacts on water resources, coastal ecosystems, infrastructure, health, agriculture, and biodiversity (high confidence).
Freshwater resources are projected to decline in far southwest and far southeast mainland Australia (high confidence) and for rivers originating
in the northeast of the South Island and east and north of the North Island of New Zealand (medium confidence). Rising sea levels and increasing
heavy rainfall are projected to increase erosion and inundation, with consequent damages to many low-lying ecosystems, infrastructure, and
housing; increasing heat waves will increase risks to human health; rainfall changes and rising temperatures will shift agricultural production
Zones; and many native species will suffer from range contractions and some may face local or even global extinction. {25.5.1, 25.6.1-2, 25.7.2,

"Warming is projected to continue through the 21st century (virtually certain) along with other changes in climate. Warming is
expected to be associated with rising snow lines (very high confidence), more frequent hot extremes, less frequent cold extremes (high
confidence), and increasing extreme rainfall related to flood risk in many locations (medium confidence). Annual average rainfall is expected to
decrease in southwestern Australia (high confidence) and elsewhere in most of far southern Australia and the northeast South Island and
northern and eastern North Island of New Zealand (medium confidence), and to increase in other parts of New Zealand (medium confidence).
Tropical cyclones are projected to increase in intensity but remain similar or decrease in numbers (low confidence), and fire weather is projected
to increase in most of southern Australia (high confidence) and many parts of New Zealand (medium confidence). Regional sea level rise will
very likely exceed the historical rate (1971-2010), consistent with global mean trends. {25.2; Table 25-1; Box 25-6; WGI AR5 13.5-6}

"Recent extreme climatic events show significant vulnerability of some ecosystems and many human systems to current climate
jariability (very high confidence), and the frequency and/or intensity of such events is projected to increase in many locations
medium to high confidence). For example, high sea surface temperatures have repeatedly bleached coral reefs in northeastern Australia
since the late 1970s) and more recently in western Australia. Recent floods in Australia and New Zealand caused severe damage to infrastructure
and settlements and 35 deaths in Queensland alone (2011); the Victorian heat wave (2009) increased heat-related morbidity and was associate:
with more than 300 excess deaths, while intense bushfires destroyed more than 2000 buildings and led to 173 deaths; and widespread droug|
n southeast Australia (1997-2009) and many parts of New Zealand (2007-2009; 2012-2013) resulted in substantial economic losses (e.g.,

"Indigenous peoples in both Australia and New Zealand have higher than average exposure to climate change because of a heavy
reliance on climate-sensitive primary industries and strong social connections to the natural environment, and face particular
constraints to adaptation (medium confidence). Social status and representation, health, infrastructure and economic issues, and engage-
ment with natural resource industries constrain adaptation and are only partly offset by intrinsic adaptive capacity (high confidence). Some
proposed responses to climate change may provide economic opportunities, particularly in New Zealand related to forestry. Torres Strait
communities are vulnerable even to small sea level rises (high confidence). {25.3, 25.8.2}
"	Text
"Adaptive capacity is generally high in many human systems, but implementation faces major constraints, especially for
transformational responses at local and community levels (high confidence). Efforts to understand and enhance adaptive capacity and
adaptation processes have increased since the AR4, particularly in Australia. Constraints on implementation arise from: absence of a consistent
information base and uncertainty about projected impacts; limited financial and human resources to assess local risks and to develop and
implement effective policies and rules; limited integration of different levels of governance; lack of binding guidance on principles and priorities;
different attitudes toward the risks associated with climate change; and different values placed on objects and places at risk. {25.4, 25.10.3;

"can be managed via adaptation and mitigation, and some are more likely to be realized than others, but all warrant attention from a risk-

management perspective.

© Some potential impacts can be delayed but now appear very difficult to avoid entirely, even with globally effective mitigation and planned
adaptation:

— Significant change in community composition and structure of coral reef systems in Australia, driven by increasing sea surface
temperatures and ocean acidification; the ability of corals to adapt naturally to rising temperatures and acidification appears limited
and insufficient to offset the detrimental effects. {25.6.2, 30.5; Box CC-CR}

— Loss of montane ecosystems and some native species in Australia, driven by rising temperatures and snow lines, increased fire risk, and
drying trends; fragmentation of landscapes, limited dispersal, and limited rate of evolutionary change constrain adaptation options. {25.6.1}

© Some impacts have the potential to be severe but can be reduced substantially by globally effective mitigation combined with adaptation,
with the need for transformational adaptation increasing with the rate and magnitude of climate change:

— Increased frequency and intensity of flood damage to settlements and infrastructure in Australia and New Zealand, driven by increasing
extreme rainfall although the amount of change remains uncertain; in many locations, continued reliance on increased protection
alone would become progressively less feasible. {25.4.2, 25.10.3; Table 25-1; Box 25-8}

— Constraints on water resources in southern Australia, driven by rising temperatures and reduced cool-season rainfall; integrated
responses encompassing management of supply, recycling, water conservation, and increased efficiency across all sectors are available
and some are being implemented in areas already facing shortages. {25.2, 25.5.2; Box 25-2}

— Increased morbidity, mortality, and infrastructure damages during heat waves in Australia, resulting from increased frequency and
magnitude of extreme high temperatures; vulnerable populations include the elderly and those with existing chronic diseases; population
increases and aging trends constrain effectiveness of adaptation responses. {25.8.1}

— Increased damages to ecosystems and settlements, economic losses, and risks to human life from wildfires in most of southern
Australia and many parts of New Zealand, driven by rising temperatures and drying trends; local planning mechanisms, building
design, early warning systems, and public education can assist with adaptation and are being implemented in regions that have
experienced major events. {25.2, 25.6.1, 25.7.1; Table 25-1; Box 25-6}

e For some impacts, severity depends on changes in climate variables that span a particularly large range, even for a given global temperature
change. The most severe changes would present major challenges if realized:

widespread damages toward the upper end of projected sea level rise ranges; managed retreat is a long-term adaptation strategy for

landward migration. Risks from sea level rise continue to increase beyond 2100 even if temperatures are stabilized. (25.4.2, 25.6.1-2;
Table 25-1; Box 25-1; WGI ARS 13.5}

Significant reduction in agricultural production in the Murray-Darling Basin and far southeastern and southwestern Australia if scenarios
of severe drying are realized; more efficient water use, allocation, and trading would increase the resilience of systems in the near term
but cannot prevent significant reductions in agricultural production and severe consequences for ecosystems and some rural communities
at the dry end of the projected changes. {25.2, 25.5.2, 25.7.2; Boxes 25-2, 25-5}

"Significant synergies and trade-offs exist between alternative adaptation responses, and between mitigation and adaptation
responses; interactions occur both within Australasia and between Australasia and the rest of the world (very high confidence).
Increasing efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change imply an increasing complexity of interactions, particularly at the intersections
among water, energy, and biodiversity, but tools to understand and manage these interactions remain limited. Flow-on effects from climate
change impacts and responses outside Australasia have the potential to outweigh some of the direct impacts within the region, particularly
economic impacts on trade-intensive sectors such as agriculture (medium confidence) and tourism (limited evidence, high agreement), but they
remain among the least explored issues. {25.7.5, 25.9.1-2; Box 25-10}

"Understanding of future vulnerability of human and mixed human-natural systems to climate change remains limited due to
incomplete consideration of socioeconomic dimensions (very high confidence). Future vulnerability will depend on factors such as
wealth and its distribution across society, patterns of aging, access to technology and information, labor force participation, societal values,
and mechanisms and institutions to resolve conflicts. These dimensions have received only limited attention and are rarely included in
vulnerability assessments, and frameworks to integrate social, psychological, and cultural dimensions of vulnerability with biophysical impacts
and economic losses are lacking. In addition, conclusions for New Zealand in many sectors, even for biophysical impacts, are based on limited
studies that often use a narrow set of assumptions, models, and data and hence have not explored the full range of potential outcomes.

"Understanding of observed and projected climate change has received
much attention since AR4, particularly in Australia, with a focus on the
causes of observed rainfall changes and more systematic analysis of
projected changes from different models and approaches. Climatic
extremes have also been a research focus. Table 25-1 presents an
assessment of this body of research for observed trends and projected
changes for a range of climatic variables (including extremes) relevant
for regional impacts and adaptation, including examples of the magnitude
of projected change, and attribution, where possible. Most studies are
based on Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (CMIP3)
models and Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) scenarios, but
CMIP5 model results are considered where available (see also WGI AR5S
Chapter 14 and Atlas; Chapter 21).

"belt and the mid-latitude storm tracks over southern Australia and New
Zealand. Tropical cyclones also affect northern Australia, and, more
rarely, ex-tropical cyclones affect some parts of New Zealand. Natural
climatic variability is very high in the region, especially for rainfall and
over Australia, with the El Nifio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) being the
most important driver (McBride and Nicholls, 1983; Power et al., 1998;
Risbey et al., 2009). The southern annular mode, Indian Ocean Dipole,
and the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation are also important regional
drivers (Thompson and Wallace, 2000; Salinger et al., 2001; Cai et al.,
2009b). This variability poses particular challenges for detecting and
projecting anthropogenic climate change and its impacts in the region.
For example, changes in ENSO in response to anthropogenic climate
change are uncertain (WGI AR5 Chapter 14) but, given current ENSO
impacts, any changes would have the potential to significantly influence
rainfall and temperature extremes, droughts, tropical cyclones, marine
conditions, and glacial mass balance (Mullan, 1995; Chinn et al., 2005;
Holbrook et al., 2009; Diamond et al., 2012; Min et al., 2013).

"The region has exhibited warming to the present (very high confidence)
and is virtually certain to continue to do so (Table 25-1). Observed and
CMIP5-modeled past and projected future annual average surface
temperatures are shown in Figures 25-1 and 25-2. For further details
see WGI ARS Atlas, Al.68-69. Changes in precipitation have been
observed with very high confidence in some areas over a range of time
scales, such as increases in northwestern Australia since the 1950s, the
autumn/winter decline since 1970 in southwestern Australia, and, since
the 1990s, in southeastern Australia, and over 1950-2004 increases in
annual rainfall in the south and west of the South Island and west of
the North Island of New Zealand, and decreases in the northeast of the
South Island and east and north of the North Island. Based on multiple
lines of evidence, annual average rainfall is projected to decrease with
high confidence in southwestern Australia. For New Zealand, annual
average rainfall is projected to decrease in the northeastern South Island
and eastern and northern North Island, and increase in other parts of
the country (medium confidence). The direction and magnitude of rainfall
change in eastern and northern Australia remains a key uncertainty
(Table 25-1).

"the region were (Hennessy et al., 20U/):

Consistent with global trends, Australia and New Zealand had
experienced warming of 0.4°C to 0.7°C since 1950 with changed
rainfall patterns and sea level rise of about 70 mm across the region;
there had also been a greater frequency and intensity of droughts
and heat waves, reduced seasonal snow cover, and glacial retreat.
Impacts from recent climate changes were evident in increasing
stresses on water supply and agriculture, and changed natural
ecosystems; some adaptation had occurred in these sectors but
vulnerability to extreme events such as fire, tropical cyclones,
droughts, hail, and floods remained high.
The climate of the 21st century would be warmer (virtually certain),
with changes in extreme events including more intense and frequent
heat waves, fire, floods, storm surges, and droughts but less frequent
frost and snow (high confidence), reduced soil moisture in large
parts of the Australian mainland and eastern New Zealand but more
rain in western New Zealand (medium confidence).
Significant advances had occurred in understanding future impacts
on water, ecosystems, indigenous people and health, together with
an increased focus on adaptation; potential impacts would be
substantial without further adaptation, particularly for water security,
coastal development, biodiversity, and major infrastructure, but
impacts on agriculture and forestry would be variable across the
region, including potential benefits in some areas.

Vulnerability would increase mainly due to an increase in extreme

events; human systems were considered to have a higher adaptive

capacity than natural systems.

Hotspots of high vulnerability by 2050 under a medium emissions

scenario included:

— Significant loss of biodiversity in areas such as alpine regions,
the Wet Tropics, the Australian southwest, Kakadu wetlands,
coral reefs, and sub-Antarctic islands

- Water security problems in the Murray-Darling basin,
southwestern Australia, and eastern New Zealand

— Potentially large risks to coastal development in southeastern
Queensland and in New Zealand from Northland to the Bay of
Plenty.

areas and their satellite communities, mostly in coastal areas (DCC,

Australia, -2 + 21% in the Murray-Darling Basin, and -5 + 22% in
southeast Queensland (Irving et al., 2012). Projected changes during
winter and spring are more pronounced and/or consistent across models
than the annual changes, for example, drying in southwestern Australia
(-32 + 11%, June to August), the Murray-Darling Basin (-16 + 22%,
June to August), and southeast Queensland (-15 + 26%, September to
November), whereas there are increases of 15% or more in the west

Downscaled CMIP3 model projections for New Zealand indicate a
stronger drying pattern in the southeast of the South Island and eastern
and northern regions of the North Island in winter and spring (Reisinger

scale changes this pattern is expected to hold once CMIP5 data are also

"The economies of Australia and New Zealand rely on natural resources,
agriculture, minerals, manufacturing and tourism, but the relative
importance of these sectors differs between the two countries.
Agriculture and mineral/energy resources accounted, respectively, for 11%
and 55% (Australia) and 56% and 5% (New Zealand) of the value of total
exports in 2010-2011 (ABS, 2012c; SNZ, 2012b). Water abstraction per
capita in both countries is in the top half of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), decreasing since
1990 in Australia but increasing in New Zealand; more than half is used
for irrigation (OECD, 2010, 2013a). Between 1970 and 2011, gross
domestic product (GDP) grew by an average of 3.2% per annum in
Australia and 2.4% per annum in New Zealand, with annual GDP per
capita growth of 1.8% and 1.2%, respectively (SNZ, 2011; ABS, 2012d).
GDP is projected to grow on average by 2.5 to 3.5% per annum in
Australia and about 1.9% per annum in New Zealand to 2050 (Australian
Treasury, 2010; Bell et al., 2010) but subject to significant shorter term

"25.4. Cross-Sectoral Adaptation:
Approaches, Effectiveness, and Constraints
"	Title
"Australia, their national share is growing and they constitute a much
higher percentage of the population in remote and very remote regions
(ABS, 2009, 2010b; SNZ, 2010a). Indigenous peoples in both countries
have lower than average life expectancy, income, and education, implying
that changes in socioeconomic status and social inclusion could strongly
influence their future adaptive capacity (see Section 25.8.2).
"	Text
"Public and private sector organizations are potentially important
adaptation actors but exhibit large differences in preparedness, linked
to knowledge about climate change, economic opportunities, external
connections, size, and scope for strategic planning (Gardner et al., 2010;
Taylor, B.M. et al., 2012; Johnston et al., 2013; Kuruppu et al., 2013; see
also Chapters 10, 16). This creates challenges for achieving holistic
societal outcomes (see also Sections 25.7-9).
"	Text
"Apart from these emerging efforts, most vulnerability studies from
Australasia make no or very limited use of socioeconomic factors,
consider only current conditions, and/or rely on postulated correlations
between generic socioeconomic indicators and climate change
vulnerability. In many cases this limits confidence in conclusions
regarding future vulnerability to climate change and adaptive capacity
of human and mixed natural-human systems.
"	Text
"Socioeconomic considerations are used increasingly to understand
adaptive capacity of communities (Preston et al., 2008; Smith et al.,
2008; Fitzsimons et al., 2010; Soste, 2010; Brunckhorst et al., 2011) and
to construct scenarios to help build regional planning capacity (Energy
Futures Forum, 2006; Frame et al., 2007; Pride et al., 2010; Pettit et al.,
2011; Taylor et al, 2011). Such scenarios, however, are only beginning
to be used to quantify vulnerability to climate change (except, e.g.,
Bohensky et al., 2011; Baynes et al., 2012; Low Choy et al., 2012).
"	Text
"Adaptation responses depend heavily on institutional and governance
arrangements (see Chapters 2, 14-16, 20). Responsibility for development
and implementation of adaptation policy in Australasia is largely
devolved to local governments and, in Australia, to State governments
and Natural Resource Management bodies. Federal/central government
supports adaptation mostly via provision of information, tools, legislation,
policy guidance, and (in Australia) support for pilot projects. A standard
risk management paradigm has been promoted to embed adaptation
into decision-making practices (AGO, 2006; MfE, 2008b; Standards
"	Text
"In New Zealand, the central government updated and expanded tools
to support impact assessments and adaptation responses consistent
with regulatory requirements (MfE, 2008b,c,d, 2010b), and revised key
directions for coastal management (Minister of Conservation, 2010).
No cross-sectoral adaptation policy framework or national-level risk
assessments exist, but some departments commissioned high-level
impacts and adaptation assessments after the AR4 (e.g., on agriculture
and on biodiversity; Wratt et al., 2008; McGlone and Walker, 2011; Clark
et al., 2012).
"	Text
"Demographic, economic, and sociocultural trends influence the
vulnerability and adaptive capacity of individuals and communities
(see Chapters 2, 11-13, 16, 20).A limited but growing number of studies
in Australasia have attempted to incorporate such information, for
example, changes in the number of people and percentage of elderly
people at risk (Preston et al., 2008; Baum et al., 2009; Preston and
Stafford-Smith, 2009; Roiko et al., 2012), the density of urban settlements
and exposed infrastructure (Preston and Jones, 2008; Preston et al.,
2008; Baynes et al., 2012), population-driven pressures on water demand
(ollands et al., 2007; CSIRO, 2009), and economic and social factors
affecting individual coping, planning, and recovery capacity (Dwyer et
al., 2004; Khan, 2012; Roiko et al., 2012).
"	Text
"Several recent policy initiatives in Australia, while responding to broader
socioeconomic and environmental pressures, include goals to reduce
vulnerability to climate variability and change. These include establishing
the Murray-Darling Basin Authority to address over-allocation of water
resources (Connell and Grafton, 2011; MDBA, 2011), removal of the
interest rate subsidy during exceptional droughts (Productivity
Commission, 2009), and management of bush fire and flood risk (VBRC,
2010; QFCI, 2012). These may be seen as examples of mainstreaming
adaptation (Dovers, 2009), but they also demonstrate lag times in policy
design and implementation, windows of opportunity presented by crises
(eg., the Millennium Drought of 1997-2009, the Victorian bushfires of
2009, and Queensland floods of 2011), and the challenges arising from
competing interests in managing finite and changing water resources
(Botterill and Dovers, 2013; Pittock, 2013; Box 25-2).
"	Text
"Australia, 2013), but broader systems and resilience approaches are used
increasingly for natural resource management (Clayton et al., 2011;
NRC, 2012). The Council of Australian Governments agreed a national
adaptation policy framework in 2007 (COAG, 2007). This included
establishing the collaborative National Climate Change Adaptation
Research Facility (NCCARF) in 2008, which complemented Commonwealth
Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)’s Climate
Adaptation Flagship. The federal government supported a first-pass
national coastal risk assessment (DCC, 2009; DCCEE, 2011), is developing
indicators and criteria for assessing adaptation progress and outcomes
(DIICCSRTE, 2013), and commissioned targeted reports addressing
impacts and management options for natural and managed landscapes
(Campbell, 2008; Steffen et al., 2009; Dunlop et al., 2012), National and
World Heritage areas (ANU, 2009; BMT WBM, 2011), and indigenous
and urban communities (Green et al., 2009; Norman, 2010). Most State
and Territory governments have also developed adaptation plans (e.g.,
DSE, 2013).

Note: The relevance of each constraint varies among organizations, sectors, and locations. Some enabling factors are only beginning to be implemented or have only been

emergency management and early warning systems; and funding for pilot studies, capital infrastructure upgrades, or retreat schemes.

"Table 25-2 summarizes key constraints and corresponding enabling factors

"there are formidable environmental, economic, informational, social,
attitudinal, and political constraints, especially for local governments
and small or highly fragmented industries. Reviews of public- and private-
sector adaptation plans and strategies in Australia demonstrate strong
efforts in institutional capacity building, but differences in assessment
methods and weaknesses in translating goals into specific policies
(White, 2009; Gardner et al., 2010; Measham et al., 2011; Preston et al.,
2011; Kay et al., 2013). Similarly, local governments in New Zealand to
date have focused mostly on impacts and climate-related hazards; some
have developed adaptation plans, but few have committed to specific
policies and steps to implementation (e.g., O'Donnell, 2007; Britton,
2010; Fitzharris, 2010; HRC, 2010; KCDC, 2012; Lawrence et al., 2013b).

"Some constraints exacerbate others. There is high confidence that the
absence of a consistent information base and binding guidelines that
clarify governing principles and liabilities is a challenge particularly for
small and resource-limited local authorities, which need to balance
special interest advocacy with longer term community resilience. This
heightens reliance on individual leadership subject to short-term
political change and can result in piecemeal and inconsistent risk
assessments and responses between levels of government and locations,
and over time (Smith et al., 2008; Brown et al., 2009; Norman, 2009;
Britton, 2010; Rouse and Norton, 2010; Abel et al., 2011; McDonald,
2011; Rive and Weeks, 2011; Corkhill, 2013; Macintosh et al., 2013). In
these situations, planners tend to rely more on single numbers for
climate projections that can be argued in court (Reisinger et al., 2011;
Lawrence et al., 2013b), which increases the risk of maladaptation given

"Responsibility for adapting to sea level rise in Australasia rests principally with local governments through spatial planning instruments.
Western Australia, South Australia, and Victoria have mandatory State planning benchmarks for 2100, with local governments
determining how they should be implemented. Long-term benchmarks in New South Wales and Queensland have either been
suspended or revoked, so local authorities now have broad discretion to develop their own adaptation plans. The New Zealand
Coastal Policy Statement (Minister of Conservation, 2010) mandates a minimum 100-year planning horizon for assessing hazard
risks, discourages hard protection of existing development, and recommends avoidance of new development in vulnerable areas.
Non-binding government guidance recommends a risk-based approach, using a base value of 0.5 m sea level rise by the 2090s and
considering the implications of at least 0.8 m and, for longer term planning, an additional 0.1 m per decade (MfE, 2008d).
"	Text
"The incorporation of climate change impacts into local planning has evolved considerably over the past 20 years, but remains piecemeal
and shows a diversity of approaches (Gibbs and Hill, 2012; Kay et al., 2013). Governments have invested in high-resolution digital
elevation models of coastal and flood prone areas in some regions, but many local governments still lack the resources for hazard
mapping and policy design. Political commitment is variable, and legitimacy of approaches and institutions is often strongly
contested (Gorddard et al., 2012), including pressure on State governments to modify adaptation policies and on local authorities to
compensate developers for restrictions on current or future land uses (LGNZ, 2008; Berry and Vella, 2010; McDonald, 2010; Reisinger
et al., 2011). Incremental adaptation responses can entrench existing rights and expectations about ongoing protection and
development, which limit options for more transformational responses such as accommodation and retreat (medium evidence, high
agreement; Gorddard et al., 2012; Barnett et al., 2013; Fletcher et al., 2013; McDonald, 2013). Strategic regional-scale planning
initiatives in rapidly growing regions, like southeast Queensland, allow climate change adaptation to be addressed in ways not
typically achieved by locality- or sector-specific plans, but require effective coordination across different scales of governance (Serrao-
Neumann et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2013).

"Sea level rise is a significant risk for Australia and New Zealand (very high confidence) due to intensifying coastal development anc
the location of population centers and infrastructure (see Section 25.3). Under a high emissions scenario (Representative Concentratio!
Pathway (RCP)8.5), global mean sea level would /ikely rise by 0.53 to 0.97 m by 2100, relative to 1986-2005, whereas with stringe
mitigation (RCP2.6), the /ikely rise by 2100 would be 0.28 to 0.6 m (medium confidence). Based on current understanding, only
instability of the Antarctic ice sheet, if initiated, could lead to a rise substantially above the /ikely range; evidence remains insufficie
to evaluate its probability, but there is medium confidence that this additional contribution would not exceed several tenths of a
meter during the 21st century (WGI ARS Section 13.5). Local case studies in New Zealand (Fitzharris, 2010; Reisinger et al, 2013) a
national reviews in Australia (DCC, 2009; DCCEE, 2011) demonstrate risks to large numbers of residential and commercial assets a:
well as key services, with widespread damages at the upper end of projected ranges (high confidence). In Australia, sea level rise o'
1.1 m would affect more than AU$226 billion of assets, including up to 274,000 residential and 8600 commercial buildings (DCCEE
2011), with additional intangible costs related to stress, health effects, and service disruption (HCCREMS, 2010) and ecosystems
(DCC, 2009; BMT WBM, 2011). Under expected future settlement patterns, exposure of the Australian road and rail network will
increase significantly once sea level rises above about 0.5 m (Baynes et al., 2012). Even if temperatures peak and decline, sea level
projected to continue to rise beyond 2100 for many centuries, at a rate dependent on future emissions (WGI ARS Section 13.5).

of climate change concern, distress, frustration, resolve, psychological
adaptation, and carbon-reducing behavior (medium evidence, high
agreement; Agho et al., 2010; Reser et al., 2012b,c). About two-thirds of
respondents expected global warming to worsen, with about half very
or extremely concerned that they or their family would be affected
directly. Direct experience with environmental changes or events attributed
to climate change, reported by 45% of respondents, was particularly
influential, but the extent to which resulting distress and concern
translate into support for planned adaptation has not been fully assessed
(Reser et al., 2012a,b).

"Vulnerability assessments that take mid- to late-century impacts as their
starting point can inhibit actors from implementing adaptation actions,
as distant impacts are easily discounted and difficult to prioritize in
competition with near-term non-climate change pressures (Productivity
Commission, 2012). Emerging leading practice models in Australia
(Balston, 2012; HCCREMS, 2012; SGS, 2012) and New Zealand (MfE,
2008a; Britton et al., 2011) recommend a high-level scan of sectors and
locations at risk and emphasize a focus on near-term decisions that
influence current and future vulnerability (which could range from early
warning systems to strategic and planning responses). More detailed
assessment can then focus on this more tractable subset of issues, based
on explicit and iterative framing of the adaptation issue (Webb et al.,
2013) and taking into account the full lifetime (lead- and consequence
time) of the decision/asset in question (Stafford-Smith et al., 2011).

"Participatory processes help balance societal preferences with robust
scientific information and ensure ownership by affected communities
but rely on human capital and political commitment (high confidence;
Hobson and Niemeyer, 2011; Rouse and Blackett, 2011; Weber et al.,
2011; Leitch and Robinson, 2012). Realizing widespread and equitable
participation is challenging where policies are complex, debates polarized,
legitimacy of institutions contested, and potential transformational
changes threaten deeply held values (Gardner et al., 2009a; Gorddard
et al., 2012; Burton and Mustelin, 2013; see also Section 25.4.3).
Regional approaches that engage diverse stakeholders, government, and
science providers, and support the co-production of knowledge can help
overcome some of these problems but require long-term institutional
and financial commitments (e.g., Britton et al., 2011; DSEWPC, 2011;
CSIRO, 2012; IOCI, 2012; Low Choy et al., 2012; Webb and Beh, 2013).

"Adapting to climate change relies on individuals accepting and
understanding changing risks and opportunities, and responding to
these changes both psychologically and behaviorally (see Chapters 2,
16). The majority of Australasians accept the reality of climate change
and less than 10% fundamentally deny its existence (high confidence;
ShapeNZ, 2009; Leviston et al., 2011; Lewandowsky, 2011; Milfont, 2012;
Reser et al., 2012b). Australians perceive themselves to be at higher risk
from climate change than New Zealanders and citizens of many other
countries, which may reflect recent experiences of climatic extremes
(Gifford et al., 2009; Agho et al., 2010; Ashworth et al., 2011; Milfont et
al., 2012; Reser et al., 2012c). However, beliefs about climate change
and its risks vary over time, are uneven across society, and reflect media
coverage and bias, political preferences, and gender (ShapeNZ, 2009;
Bacon, 2011; Leviston et al., 2012; Milfont, 2012), which can influence
attitudes to adaptation (Gardner et al., 2010; Gifford, 2011; Reser et al.,
2011; Alexander et al., 2012; Raymond and Spoehr, 2013).

"In addition to raising minimum floor levels and creating coastal setbacks to limit further development in areas at risk, several councils
in Australia and New Zealand have consulted on or attempted to implement managed retreat policies (ECAN, 2005; BSC, 2010; HDC,
2012; KCDC, 2012). These policies remain largely untested in New Zealand, but experience in Australia has shown high litigation
potential and opposing priorities at different levels of government, undermining retreat policies (SCCCWEA, 2009; DCCEE, 2010; Abel
et al., 2011). Mandatory disclosure of information about future risks, community engagement, and policy stability are critical to support
retreat, but existing-use rights, liability concerns, special interests, community resources, place attachment, and divergent priorities at
different levels of government present powerful constraints (high confidence; Hayward, 2008b; Berry and Vella, 2010; McDonald,
2010; Abel et al., 2011; Alexander et al., 2012; Leitch and Robinson, 2012; Macintosh et al., 2013; Reisinger et al., 2013).

"Many existing climate change impact assessments in Australia and New Zealand focus on the distant future (2050 to
2100). When contrasted with more near-term non-climate pressures, the inevitable uncertainty of distant climate impacts
can impede effective adaptation. Emerging best practice in Australasia recognizes this challenge and instead focuses
on those decisions that can and will be made in the near future in any case, along with the “lifetime” of those decisions,
and the risk from climate change during that lifetime. Thus, for example, the choice of next year’s annual crop, even
though it is greatly affected by climate, only matters for a year or two and can be adjusted relatively quickly. Even
land-use change among cropping, grazing, and forestry industries has demonstrated significant flexibility in Australasia
over the space of a decade. When the adaptation challenge is reframed as implications for near-term decisions,
uncertainty about the distant future becomes less problematic and adaptation responses can be better integrated
into existing decision-making processes and early warning systems.

institutions). Examples of this are particularly prominent in Australasia
in the coastal zone (e.g., Hayward, 2008a; King et al., 2010; Gorddard

"Some decisions, such as those about long-lived infrastructure and spatial planning and of a public good nature, must
take a long-term view and deal with significant uncertainties and trade-offs between short- and long-term goals
and values. Even then, widely used techniques can help reduce challenges for decision making—including the
“precautionary principle,” “real options,” “adaptive management,” “no regrets strategies,” or “risk hedging”. These
can be matched to the type of uncertainty but depend on a regulatory framework and institutions that can support
such approaches, including the capacity of practitioners to implement them robustly.

"Climate change impacts on water represent a cross-cutting issue affecting
people, agriculture, industries, and ecosystems. The challenge of satisfying
multiple demands with a limited resource is exacerbated by the high
interannual and inter-decadal variability of river flows (Chiew and
McMahon, 2002; Peel et al., 2004; Verdon et al., 2004; McKerchar et al.,
2010) particularly in Australia. Declining river flows since the mid-1970s
in far southwestern Australia have led to changed water management
(see Box 11.2 in Hennessy et al., 2007). The unprecedented decline in river
flows during the 1997-2009 “Millennium” drought in southeastern
Australia resulted in low irrigation water allocations, severe water
restrictions in urban centers, suspension of water sharing arrangements,
and major environmental impacts (Chiew and Prosser, 2011; Leblanc et
al., 2012).
"	Text
"Adaptation is not a one-off action but will take place along an evolving pathway, in which decisions will be revisited
repeatedly as the future unfolds and more information comes to hand (see Figure 25-3). Although this creates learning
opportunities, successive short-term decisions need to be monitored to avoid unwittingly creating an adaptation path
that is not sustainable as climate change continues, or that would cope only with a limited subset of possible climate
futures. This is sometimes referred to as maladaptation. Changing pathways—for example, shifting from ongoing
coastal protection to gradual retreat from the most exposed areas—can be challenging and may require new types
of interactions among governments, industry, and communities.

"Perceived risks and potential losses from climate change depend on values
associated by individuals with specific places, activities, and objects.
Examples from Australia include the value placed on snow cover in the
Snowy Mountains (Gorman-Murray, 2008, 2010), risks to biodiversity
and recreational values in coastal South Australia (Raymond and Brown,
2011), conflicts between human uses and environmental priorities in
national parks (Wyborn, 2009; Roman et al., 2010), and trade-offs between
alternative water supplies and relocation in rural areas (Hurlimann and
Dolnicar, 2011). These and additional studies in Australasia confirm that
the more individuals identify with particular places and their natural
features, the stronger the perceived potential loss but also the greater
the motivation to address environmental threats (e.g., Rogan et al.,
2005; McCleave et al., 2006; Collins and Kearns, 2010; Gosling and
Williams, 2010; Raymond et al., 2011; Russell et al., 2013). This indicates
that ecosystem-based climate change adaptation (see Box CC-EA) can
provide co-benefits for subjective well-being and mental health,
especially for disadvantaged and indigenous communities (Berry et al.,

"Rural water reform in southeastern Australia, focused on the Murray-Darling Basin, is currently being implemented. The Murray-
Darling Basin Plan (MDBA, 2011, 2012) will return 2750 GL yr of consumptive water (about one-fifth of current entitlements) to
riverine ecosystems and develop flexible and adaptive water sharing mechanisms to cope with current and future climates. In 2012,
the Australian government committed more than AU$12 billion nationally to upgrade water infrastructure, improve water use
efficiency, and purchase water entitlements for environmental use. The Basin Plan also includes an environmental watering plan to
optimize environmental outcomes for the Basin. Water markets are a key policy instrument, allowing water use patterns to adapt to
shifting availability and water to move toward higher value uses (NWC, 2010; Kirby et al., 2012). For example, the two-thirds reductio
in irrigation water use over 2000-2009 in the Basin resulted in only 20% reduction in gross agricultural returns, mainly because
water use shifted to more valuable enterprises (Kirby et al., 2012). Elsewhere, catchment management authorities and State agencic
throughout southeastern Australia develop water management strategies to cope with prolonged droughts and climate change (e.g
DSE, 2011). Nevertheless, if the extreme dry end of future water projections is realized (Section 25.5.2; Figure 25-4), agriculture and
ecosystems across southeastern and southwestern Australia would be threatened even with comprehensive adaptation (see Section
25.6.1, 25.7.1-2; Connor et al., 2009; Kirby et al., 2013).

including changes in atmospheric CO,, fire management, grazing, and
land use. The 1997-2009 drought had severe impacts in freshwater
systems in the eastern States and the Murray-Darling Basin (Pittock and
Finlayson, 2011) but, in many freshwater systems, direct climate impacts
are difficult to detect above the strong signal of over-allocation, pollution,
sedimentation, exotic invasions, and natural climate variability Jenkins
et al., 2011). In New Zealand, few if any impacts on ecosystems have
been directly attributed to climate change rather than variability (Box
25-3; McGlone et al., 2010; McGlone and Walker, 2011). Alpine treelines
in New Zealand have remained roughly stable for several hundred years

"The success of urban water reforms in the face of drought and climate change can be variously interpreted. Increasing supply through
desalinization plants and water reuse schemes reduces the risk of future water shortages and helps cities cope with increasing
population. Uptake of household-scale adaptation options has been locally significant but their long-term sustainability or reversibility
in response to changing drivers and societal attitudes needs further research (Troy, 2008; Brown and Farrelly, 2009; Mankad and
Tapsuwan, 2011). Desalinization plants can be maladaptive because of their energy demand, and the enhancement of mass supply
could create a disincentive for reducing demand or increasing resilience through diversifying supply (Barnett and O'Neill, 2010;
Taptiklis, 2011).

"Climate change and population growth are the two major factors that influence water planning in Australian capital cities. In
Melbourne, for example, planning has centered on securing new supplies that are more resilient to major climate shocks; increasing
use of alternative sources such as sewage recycling and stormwater for non-potable water; programs to reduce demand; water-
sensitive urban design; and integrated planning that considers climate change impact on water supply, flood risk, and stormwater
and wastewater infrastructures (DSE, 2007; Skinner, 2010; DSE, 2011; Rhodes et al., 2012). Melbourne's water augmentation program
includes a desalinization plant with a 150 GL yr“ capacity (about one-third of the current demand), following the lead of Perth,
where a desalinization plant was established in 2006 because of declining inflows since the mid-1970s (Rhodes et al., 2012).
Melbourne's water conservation strategies include water efficiency and rebate programs for business and industry, water smart
gardens, dual flush toilets, grey water systems, rainwater tank rebates, free water-efficient showerheads, and voluntary residential
use targets. These conservation measures, together with water use restrictions since the early 2000s, have reduced Melbourne's total
per capita water use by 40% (Fitzgerald, 2009; Rhodes et al., 2012). Similar programs reduced Brisbane's per capita water use by
about 50% (Shearer, 2011), while adoption of water recycling and rainwater harvesting resulted in up to 60% water savings in some
parts of Adelaide (Barton and Argue, 2009).

Anticipated rates of climate change, together with fragmentation of
remaining habitat and limited migration options in many regions
(Steffen et al., 2009; Morrongiello et al., 2011), will limit in situ adaptive
capacity and distributional shifts to more climatically suitable areas for
many species (high confidence). Significant local and global losses of

high confidence that one of the most vulnerable Australian ecosystems
is the alpine zone because of loss of snow cover, invasions by exotic

2008). There is also high confidence in substantial risks to coastal
wetlands such as Kakadu National Park subject to saline intrusion (BMT

"Depending on the extent of climate changes and plant responses to
increasing CO,, the above studies provide limited evidence but high
agreement of potential net increased productivity in many areas, but
only where soil nutrients are not limiting. Adaptation strategies include
changes to species or provenance selection toward trees better adapted
to warmer conditions, or adopting different silvicultural options to increase
resilience to climatic or biotic stresses, such as pest challenges (White et
al., 2009; Booth et al., 2010; Singh et al., 2010; Wilson and Turton, 201 1a).
The greatest barriers to long-term adaptation planning are incomplete
knowledge of plant responses to increased CO, and uncertainty in
regional climate scenarios (medium evidence, high agreement; Medlyn
et al. 201 1b). The rotation time of plantation forests of about 30 years or
more makes proactive adaptation important but also challenging.

"Australia produces 93% of its domestic food requirements and exports
76% of agricultural production (PMSEIC, 2010a). New Zealand agriculture
contributes about 56% of total export value and dairy products 27%;
95% of dairy products are exported (SNZ, 2012b). Agricultural production
is sensitive to climate (especially drought; Box 25-5) but also to many
non-climate factors such as management, which thus far has limited
both detection and attribution of climate-related changes (see Chapters
7, 18; Webb, L.B. et al., 2012; Darbyshire et al., 2013). Because the region
is a major exporter—providing, for example, more than 40% of the
world trade in dairy products—changes in production conditions in the
region have a major influence on world supply (OECD, 2011). This
implies that climate change impacts could have consequences for food
security not just locally but even globally (Qureshi et al., 2013a).

"photosynthesis remains stimulated under elevated CO, (Battaglia et al.,
2009). Most studies also exclude impacts of pests, diseases, weeds, fire,
and wind damage that may change adversely with climate. Fire, for
instance, poses a significant threat in Australia and is expected to worsen
with climate change (see Box 25-6), especially for the commercial forestry
plantations in the southern winter-rainfall regions (Williams et al., 2009;
Clarke et al., 2011). In New Zealand, changes in biotic factors are
particularly important as they already affect plantation productivity.
Dothistroma blight, for instance, is a serious pine disease with a
temperature optimum that coincides with New Zealand's warmer, but
not warmest, pine-growing regions; under climate change, its severity
is, therefore, expected to reduce in the warm central North Island but
increase in the cooler South Island (high confidence) where it could offset
temperature-driven improved plantation growth (Watt et al., 2011a). There
is medium evidence and high agreement of similar future southward shifts
in the distribution of existing plantation weed, insect pest, and disease
species in Australia (see review in Medlyn et al., 2011b).

"Rainfall is a key determinant of interannual variability in production and
profitability of pastures and rangelands (Radcliffe and Baars, 1987;
Steffen et al., 2011) yet remains the most uncertain change. In northern
Australia, incremental adaptation may be adequate to manage risks
of climate change to the grazing industry but an increasing frequency
of droughts and reduced summer rainfall will potentially drive the
requirement for transformational change (Cobon et al., 2009). Rangelands
that are currently water-limited are expected to show greater sensitivity
to temperature and rainfall changes than nitrogen-limited ones
(Webb, N.P. et al, 2012). The “water-sparing” effect of elevated CO,
(offsetting reduced water availability from reduced rainfall and
increased temperatures) is invoked in many impact studies but does not
always translate into production benefits (Kamman et al., 2005; Newton
et al., 2006; Stokes and Ash, 2007; Wan et al., 2007). The impact of
elevated CO, on forage production, quality, nutrient cycling, and water
availability remains the major uncertainty in modeling system responses
(McKeon et al., 2009; Finger et al., 2010); recent findings of grazing
impacts on plant species composition (Newton et al., 2013) and nitrogen
fixation (Watanabe et al., 2013) under elevated CO, have added to this
uncertainty. New Zealand agro-ecosystems are subject to erosion
processes strongly driven by climate; greater certainty in projections of
rainfall, particularly storm frequency, are needed to better understand

"Studies modeling seasonal changes in fodder supply show greater
sensitivity in animal production to climate change and elevated CO,
than models using annual average production, with some impacts
expected even under modest warming (high confidence) in both New
Zealand (Lieffering et al., 2012) and Australia (Moore and Ghahramani,
2013).Across 25 sites in southern Australia (an area that produces 85%
of sheep and 40% of beef production by value) modeled profitability
declined at most sites by the 2050s because of a shorter growing season
due to changes in both rainfall and temperature (Moore and Ghahramani,
2013). In New Zealand, projected changes in seasonal pasture growth
drove changes in animal production at four sites representing the main
areas of sheep production (Lieffering et al., 2012). In Hawke's Bay,
changes in stock number and the timing of grazing were able to maintain
farm income for a period in the face of variable forage supply but not
in the longer term. In Southland and Waikato, projected increases in
early spring pasture growth posed management problems in maintaining
pasture quality, yet, if these were met, animal production could be
maintained or increased. The temperature-humidity index (THI), an
indicator of potential heat stress for animals, increased from 1960 to
2008 in the Murray Dairy region of Australia and further increases and
reductions in milk production are projected (Nidumolu et al., 2011).
Shading can substantially reduce, but not avoid, the temperature and

Australia (2006/7-2008/9), for example, is estimated to have reduced national GDP by about 0.75% (RBA, 2006) and regional GDP in
the southern Murray-Darling Basin was about 5.7% below forecast in 2007/08, along with the temporary loss of 6000 jobs (Wittwer
and Griffith, 2011). Widespread drought in New Zealand during 2007-2009 reduced direct and off-farm output by about NZ$3.6
billion (Butcher, 2009). The 2012-2013 drought in New Zealand is estimated to have reduced national GDP by 0.3 to 0.6% and

social, and environmental pressures, such as changing government policies (e.g., on drought, carbon pricing; Productivity Commission,
2009; Nelson et al., 2010) and access to water resources. The vulnerability of rural communities differs within and between countries,
reflecting differences in financial security, environmental awareness, policy and social support, strategic skills, and capacity for

communities, including farm closures, increased poverty, increased off-farm work, and, hence, involuntary separation of families,
increased social isolation, rising stress and associated health impacts, including suicide (especially of male farmers), accelerated rural

interaction with community organizations (Edwards and Gray, 2009). While social and cultural changes have the potential to undermine
the adaptive capacity of communities (Smith, W. et al., 2011), robust ongoing engagement between farmers and the local community
can contribute to a strong sense of community and enhance potential for resilience (McManus et al., 2012; see also Section 25.4.3).

Crook et al., 2011; Odeh et al., 2011). New Zealand’s predominantly
hydroelectric power generation is vulnerable to precipitation variability.
Increasing winter precipitation and snow melt, and a shift from snowfall

winter/spring inflows to main hydro lakes are projected to increase by
5 to 10% over the next few decades (McKerchar and Mullan, 2004;
Poyck et al., 2011). Further reductions in seasonal snow and glacial melt

"In Australia, fire management will become increasingly challenging under climate change, potentially exacerbating conflicting
management objectives for biodiversity conservation versus protection of property (high confidence; O'Neill and Handmer, 2012;
Whittaker et al., 2013). Current initiatives center on planning and regulations, building design to reduce flammability, fuel management,
early warning systems, and fire detection and suppression (Handmer and Haynes, 2008; Preston et al., 2009; VBRC, 2010; O'Neill and
Handmer, 2012). Some Australian authorities are taking climate change into account when rethinking approaches to managing fire to
restore ecosystems while protecting human life and properties (Preston et al, 2009; Adams and Attiwill, 2011). Improved understanding
of climate drivers of fire risk is assisting fire management agencies, landowners, and communities in New Zealand (Pearce et al.,

"Climate change and fire will have complex impacts on vegetation communities and biodiversity (Williams et al., 2009). Greatest
impacts in Australia are expected in sclerophyll forests of the southeast and southwest (Williams et al., 2009). Most New Zealand
native ecosystems have limited exposure but also limited adaptations to fire (Ogden et al., 1998; McGlone and Walker, 2011). There is
high confidence that increased fire incidence will increase risk in southern Australia to people, property, and infrastructure such as
electricity transmission lines (Parsons Brinkerhoff, 2009; O'Neill and Handmer, 2012; Whittaker et al, 2013) and in parts of New
Zealand where urban margins expand into rural areas (Jakes et al., 2010; Jakes and Langer, 2012); exacerbate some respiratory
conditions such as asthma (Johnston et al., 2002; Beggs and Bennett, 2011); and increase economic risks to plantation forestry (Watt
et al., 2008; Pearce et al., 2011). Forest regeneration following wildfires also reduces water yields (Brown et al., 2005; MDBC, 2007),
while reduced vegetation cover increases erosion risk and material washoff to waterways with implications for water quality

warmer and drier conditions mostly benefit but wetter conditions and
extreme climate events undermine tourism (Wilson and Becken, 2011).

"Tourism contributes 2.6 to 4% of GDP to the economies of Australia
and New Zealand (ABS, 2010a; SNZ, 2011). The net present value of the
Great Barrier Reef alone over the next 100 years has been estimated at
AU$51.4 billion (Oxford Economics, 2009). Most Australasian tourism is
exposed to climate variability and change (see Section 25.2 for projected
trends), and some destinations are highly sensitive to extreme events
(Hopkins et al., 2012). The 2011 floods and Tropical Cyclone Yasi, for
example, cost the Queensland tourism industry about AU$590 million,
mainly due to cancellations and damage to the Great Barrier Reef (PwC,
2011); and drought in the Murray-Darling Basin caused an estimated
AU$70 million loss in 2008 due to reduced visitor days (TRA, 2010).

by 1 to 2% per degree Celsius across New Zealand and 2(+1)% in New
South Wales, but increase by 1.1(+1.4)% and 4.6(+2.7)% in Queensland
and South Australia due to air conditioning demand (Stroombergen et
al., 2006; Jollands et al., 2007; Thatcher, 2007; Nguyen et al., 2010).
Increased summer peak demand, particularly in Australia (see also
Figure 25-5), will place additional stress on networks and can result in
blackouts (very high confidence; Jollands et al., 2007; Thatcher, 2007;
Howden and Crimp, 2008; Wang et al., 2010a). During the 2009 Victorian
heat wave, demand rose by 24% but electrical losses from transmission
lines increased by 53% due to higher peak currents (Nguyen et al.,

left more than 500,000 people without power (QUT, 2010). Various
adaptation options to limit increasing urban energy demand exist and

"There is limited evidence but high agreement that without additional
adaptation, distribution networks in most Australian states will be at
high risk of failure by 2031-2070 under non-mitigation scenarios due
to increased bushfire risk and potential strengthening and southward
shift of severe cyclones in tropical regions (Maunsell and CSIRO, 2008;
Parsons Brinkerhoff, 2009). Adaptation costs have been estimated at
AU$2.5 billion to 2015, with more than half to meet increasing demand
for air conditioning and the remainder to increase resilience to climate-
related hazards; underground cabling would reduce bushfire risk but
has large investment costs that are not included (Parsons Brinkerhoff,
2009). Decentralized ownership of assets constitutes a significant
adaptation constraint (ATSE, 2008; Parsons Brinkerhoff, 2009). In New
Zealand, increasing high winds and temperatures have been identified
qualitatively as the most relevant risks to transmission (Jollands et al.,
2007; Renwick et al., 2009).

"Short investment horizons, high substitutability, and a high proportion
of human capital compared with built assets give high confidence that
the adaptive capacity of the tourism industry is high overall, except for
destinations where climate change is projected to degrade core natural
assets and diversification opportunities are limited (Evans et al., 2011;
Morrison and Pickering, 2011). Strategic adaptation decisions are
constrained by uncertainties in regional climatic changes (Turton et al.,

and limited coordinated forward planning (Sanders et al., 2008; Turton

integrated assessment of tourism vulnerability in Australasia is not yet
possible owing to limited understanding of future changes in tourism

effects of changing travel behavior and tourism preferences in other

"Both New Zealand and Australia have formalized adaptation strategies

In Australia, institutions at various levels also promote preparation for
extreme events (Tourism Queensland, 2007, 2010; Tourism Victoria,
2010) and strengthening ecosystem resilience to maintain destination
attractiveness (GBRMPA, 2009b). Snow-making is already broadly
adopted to increase reliability of skiing (Bicknell and McManus, 2006;
Hennessy et al., 2008b), but its future effectiveness depends on location.
In New Zealand, even though warming will significantly reduce the
number of days suitable for snow-making (Hendrikx and Hreinsson, 2012),
sufficient snow could be made in all years until the end of the 21st century
to maintain current minimum operational skiing conditions. Options for
resorts in Australia's Snowy Mountains are far more limited (Hendrikx et
al., 2013), where maintaining skiing conditions until at least 2020 would
require AU$100 million in capital investment into 700 snow guns and 2.5

239,000 to 870,000 cases by 2100, are projected under a range of

on their observed positive relationship with temperature, notifications

Water-borne zoonotic diseases such as cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis

change is projected to result in 11% fewer temperature-related deaths
in both 2050 and 2100 in Australia, but 14% and 100% more deaths in
2050 and 2100, respectively, without mitigation under a hot, dry A1Fl
scenario (Bambrick et al., 2008; see Chapter 11 for detail on temperature-
related health trade-offs). Net results were driven almost entirely by
increased mortality in the north, especially Queensland, consistent with
Huang et al. (2012). In a separate study that accounted for increased daily
temperature variability, a threefold increase in heat-related deaths is
projected for Sydney by 2100 for the A2 scenario, assuming no adaptation

increased hospitalizations, and occasional deaths (medium confidence;

"Insurance helps spread the risk from extreme events across communities and over time and therefore enhances the resilience of
society to disasters (see Section 10.7). In Australia, insured losses are dominated by meteorological hazards, including the 2011
Queensland floods and the 1999 Sydney hailstorm (ICA, 2012) with estimated claims of AU$3 billion per annum (IAA, 2011b). In Ne
Zealand, floods and storms are the second most costly natural hazards after earthquakes (ICNZ, 2013). The number of damaging
insured events (up to a certain loss value) has increased significantly in the Oceania region since 1980 (Schuster, 2013). Normalized
losses in Australia show no significant trend from at least 1967 to 2006 (Crompton and McAneney, 2008; Crompton et al., 2010;
Table 10-4), consistent with the global conclusion (IPCC, 2012) that increasing exposure of people and economic assets has been th
major cause of long-term increases in economic losses from weather- and climate-related disasters. Issues relating to data quality
and methodological choices prevent definitive conclusions regarding the role of climate change in loss trends (Crompton et al., 201
Nicholls, 2011; IPCC, 2012).

"Insurance can contribute positively to risk reduction by providing incentives to policy holders to reduce their risk profile (O'Neill and
Handmer, 2012), for example, through resilience ratings given to buildings (TGA, 2009; Edge Environment, 2011; IAG, 2011). Apart
from constituting an autonomous private sector response to extreme events, insurance can also be framed as a form of social policy
to manage climate risks, similar to New Zealand's government insurance scheme (Glavovic et al., 2010); government measures to
reduce or avoid risks also interact with insurance companies’ willingness to provide cover (Booth and Williams, 2012). Yet insurance
can also act as a constraint on adaptation, if those living in climate-risk prone localities pay discounted or cross-subsidized premiums
or policies fail to encourage betterment after damaging events by requiring replacement of “like for like,” constituting a missed
opportunity for risk reduction (NDIR, 2011; QFCI, 2012; Reisinger et al., 2013; see also Section 10.7). The effectiveness of insurance

"Little adaptation of Indigenous communities to climate change is
apparent to date (cf. Burroughs, 2010; GETF 2011; Nursey-Bray et al.,
2013; Zander et al., 2013). Plans and policies that are imposed on
Indigenous communities can constrain their adaptive capacity (Ellemor,
2005; Petheram et al., 2010; Veland et al., 2010; Langton et al., 2012)
but participatory development of adaptation strategies is challenged
by multiple stressors and uncertainty about causes of observed changes
(Leonard, S. et al., 2010; Nursey-Bray et al., 2013). Adaptation planning
would benefit from a robust typology (Maru et al., 2011) across the
diversity of Indigenous life experience (McMichael et al., 2009). Indigenous
re-engagement with environmental management (e.g., Hunt et al.,
2009; Ross et al., 2009) can promote health (Burgess et al., 2009) and
may increase adaptive capacity (Berry et al., 2010; Davies et al., 2011).
There is emerging interest in integrating Indigenous observations of
climate change (Green, D. et al., 2010b; Petheram et al., 2010) and
developing inter-cultural communication tools (Leonard, S. et al., 2010;
Woodward et al., 2012). Extensive land ownership in northern and
inland Australia and land management traditions mean that Indigenous
people are well situated to provide greenhouse gas abatement and
carbon sequestration services that may also support their livelihood
aspirations (Whitehead et al., 2009; Heckbert et al., 2012).

"Considerable opportunities exist for Australasian cities and towns to reduce climate change impacts and, in some regions, benefit
from projected changes such as warmer winters and more secure water supply (Fitzharris, 2010; Australian Government, 2012). Many
tools and practices developed for sustainable resource management or disaster risk reduction in urban areas are co-beneficial for
climate change adaptation, and vice versa, and can be integrated with mitigation objectives (Hamin and Gurran, 2009). Despite the
abundance of potential adaptation options, however, social, cultural, institutional, and economic factors frequently constrain their
implementation (high confidence; see also Section 25.4.2). The form and longevity of cities and towns, with their concentration of
hard and critical infrastructure such as housing, transport, energy, stormwater and wastewater systems, telecommunications, and
public facilities provide additional challenges (see also Chapters 8, 10; Sections 25.7.4, 25.8.1; Boxes 25-1, 25-2, 25-8). Transport

"Overall, the implementation of climate change adaptation policy for urban settlements in Australia and New Zealand has been mixed.
The Australian National Urban Policy encourages adaptation, and many urban plans include significant adaptation policies (e.g., City
of Melbourne, 2009; City of Port Phillip, 2010; ACT Government, 2012; City of Adelaide, 2012). New Zealand also promotes urban
adaptation through strategies, plans, and guidance documents (MfE, 2008b; CCC, 2010; WCC, 2010; Auckland Council, 2012; NIWA et
al., 2012). Many examples of incremental urban adaptation exist (Box 25-2; Table 25-5), particularly where these include co-benefits
and respond to other stressors, like prolonged drought in southern Australia and recurrent floods. Experience is much scarcer with
more flexible land uses, managed relocation, and ecosystem-based adaptation that could transform existing settlement patterns and
development trends, and where maintaining flexibility to address long-term climate risks can run against near-term development
pressures (see Boxes 25-1, 25-2, 25-8, CC-EA). Decision-making models that support such adaptive and transformative changes
(Section 25.4.2; Box 25-1) have not yet been implemented widely in urban contexts; increased coordination among different levels of
government may be required to spread costs and balance public and private, near- and long-term, and local and regional benefits

Sector(s) affected

Biodiversity, tourism

Examples of interactions between impacts and adaptation responses

Potential for greater conflict between conservation managers and other park users in Kosciuszko National Park if increasing fire
incidence causes park closures, either to reduce risk, or to rehabilitate vegetation after fires (Wyborn, 2009), e.g., objectives of the
Wildfire Management Overlay (WMO) in Victoria conflict with vegetation conservation (Hughes and Mercer, 2009).

 

 

Reduction of risk to energy
transmission from bushfires

Biodiversity, energy

Underground cabling would reduce both the susceptibility of transmission networks to fire and ignition sources for wild fires, thus
reducing risks to ecosystems and settlements; constraints include significant investment cost, diverse ownership of assets, and
lack of an overarching national strategy (ATSE, 2008; Parsons Brinkerhoff, 2009; Linnenluecke et al., 2011).

 

Protection of coastal
infrastructure

Biodiversity, tourism

Seawalls may provide habitat but these communities have different diversity and structure from those developing on natural
substrates (Jackson et al., 2008); groynes potentially alter beach fauna diversity and community structure (Walker et al., 2008);
continuing hard protection against sea level rise results in long-term loss of coastal amenities (Gorddard et al., 2012).

 

Avoidance of risks from sea
level rise via relocation

Indigenous communities

Relocation can avoid increasing local pressures on communities from sea level rise but raises complex cultural, land rights, legal, and
economic issues, e.g., potential relocation of Torres Strait islander communities (Green, D. et al., 2010a; McNamara et al., 2011).

 

Allocating scarce water
resources via market
instruments

Rural areas, agriculture,
mining

Market based instruments such as water trading help allocation of scarce water resources to the highest value uses. The negative
implications of this include potential loss of access to lower value users, which in some areas includes agriculture and drinking
water supplies, with potentially significant social, environmental, and wider economic consequences (Kiem and Austin, 2012).

 

Increased water security via
augmentation of supply for
urban and agricultural systems

 

Biodiversity, water
demand management

 

Water storage can buffer urban settlements and agricultural systems against high variability in river flows, but altered flow
regimes can have significant negative impacts on freshwater ecosystems (Bond et al., 2008; Pittock et al., 2008; Kingsford, 2011).
Discharge from desalination plants (e.g. in Perth and Sydney) can lead to substantial local increases in salinity and temperature,

and the accumulation of metals, hydrocarbons, and toxic anti-fouling compounds in receiving waters (Roberts et al., 2010);
increasing supply can reduce the effectiveness of demand-side measures (Barnett and O'Neill, 2010; Taptiklis, 2011; Box 25-2)

Examples of interactions between adaptation and mitigation responses

 

Adaptation to decreasing
snowfall

Biodiversity, energy
use, water use

Snowmaking in the Australian Alps would require large additional energy and water resources by 2020 of 2500-3300 MI of water per
month, more than half the average monthly water consumption by Canberra in 2004-2005. Increased snowmaking negatively affects
vegetation, soils, and hydrology of subalpine—alpine areas (Pickering and Buckley, 2010; Morrison and Pickering, 2011; ABS, 2012a).

 

Air conditioning for heat
stress

Health, energy use

Rising temperatures degrade building energy efficiency (Wang et al., 2010a) and increase energy demand and associated CO, emissions
if summer cooling needs are met by increased air conditioning (Stroombergen et al., 2006; Thatcher, 2007; Wang et al., 2010a).

 

Renewable wind energy
production

Biodiversity

Wind-farms can have localized negative effects on bats and birds. However, risk assessment of the potential negative impacts of wind
turbines on threatened bird species in Australia indicated low to negligible impacts on all species modeled (Smales, 2006).

 

Urban densification

Biodiversity, water,
health

Higher urban density to reduce energy consumption from transport and infrastructure can result in loss of permeable surfaces and tree
cover, intensify flood risks, and exacerbate discomfort and health impacts of hotter summers (Hamin and Gurran, 2009).

 

Water supply from
desalination

Energy demand

Meeting increasing urban water demand via desalination plants increases energy demand and CO, emissions if this demand is met by
increased fossil fuel energy generation (Barnett and O'Neill, 2010; Stamatov and Stamatov, 2010).

 

Secure food production in
a warming climate

Nitrous oxide and
methane emissions

Net greenhouse gas emissions intensity from dairy systems in southern Australia have been estimated to increase in future in several
locations due to a changing climate and management responses (Cullen and Eckard, 2011; Eckard and Cullen, 2011). A shift toward

perennial C4 grasses would increase methane emissions from grazing ruminants due to lower feed quality, but studies in southwest

Australia suggest this could be more than offset by increased soil carbon storage (Thomas et al., 2012; Bradshaw et al., 2013).

 

Housing design to reduce
peak energy demand

Energy use,
infrastructure, health

Reducing peak energy demand through building design and demand management reduces vulnerability of electricity networks and
transmission losses during heat waves (Parsons Brinkerhoff, 2009; Nguyen et al., 2010), reduces heat stress during summer, and provides
health benefits during winter (Strengers, 2008; Howden-Chapman, 2010; Strengers and Maller, 2011; Ren et al., 2012).

 

Energy from second-
generation biofuels

Biodiversity, rural
areas, agriculture

New crops such as oil mallees or other eucalypts may provide multiple benefits, especially in marginal areas, displacing fossil fuels or
sequestering carbon, generating income for landholders (essential oils, charcoal, bio-char, biofuels), and providing ecosystem services
including reducing erosion (Cocklin and Dibden, 2009; Giltrap et al., 2009; McHenry, 2009).

 

 

Reduced emissions from Biodiversity, Improved management of savannah fires to reduce the extent of high-intensity late season fires could substantially reduce emissions as
fires livelihoods well as having significant benefits for biodiversity and indigenous employment (Russell-Smith et al., 2009; Bradshaw et al., 2013).
Reduce methane Biodiversity, Feral camels in Australia are projected to double from 1 to 2 million by 2020. Controlling their numbers to reduce methane emissions
emissions from feral agriculture could have significant biodiversity benefits (NRMMC, 2010; Bradshaw et al., 2013). Economic benefits of reduced grazing competition,

through reduced erosion (Giltrap et al., 2009). Policies to protect water quality by limiting nitrogen discharge from agriculture have
reduced livestock production and greenhouse gas emissions in the Lake Taupo and Rotorua catchments and supported land-use
change toward sequestration (OECD, 2013b).

"Photosynthesis transfers water to the atmosphere, so increased sequestration is projected to reduce catchment yields particularly in
southern Australia and affect water quality negatively (CSIRO, 2008; Schrobback et al., 2011; Bradshaw et al., 2013). Accounting for
this water use in water allocations for sequestration activities would increase their cost and limit the potential of sequestration-driven
land use change (Polglase et al., 2011; Stewart et al., 2011). Large-scale land-cover changes also affect local and regional climates
and soil moisture through changing albedo, evaporation, plant transpiration, and surface roughness (McAlpine et al., 2009;
Kirschbaum et al., 2011b), but these feedbacks have rarely been included in analyses of changing water demands and availability.

"Trade-offs between biofuel and food production and ecosystem services depend strongly on the type of sequestration activity and
their management relies on the use of consistent principles to evaluate externalities and benefits of alternative land uses (PMSEIC,
201 0b). First-generation biofuels have been modeled in Australia as directly competing with agricultural production (Bryan et al.,
2010). In contrast, production of woody biofuels in New Zealand is projected to occur on marginal land, not where the most intense
agriculture occurs (Todd et al., 2009). Falling costs and increasing efficiency of solar energy may limit future biofuel demand, given
the limited efficiency of plants in converting solar energy into usable fuel (e.g., Reijnders and Huijbregts, 2007).

Table 25-8 | Key regional risks from climate change and the potential for reducing risk through mitigation and adaptation. Key risks are identified based on assessment
of the literature and expert judgments by chapter authors, with evaluation of evidence and agreement in the supporting chapter sections. Each key risk is characterized on
a scale from very low to very high and presented in three timeframes: the present, near-term (2030-2040), and long-term (2080-2100). For the near-term era of
committed climate change (here, for 2030-2040), projected levels of global mean temperature increase do not diverge substantially across emissions scenarios. For the
longer-term era of climate options (here, for 2080-2100), risk levels are presented for global mean temperature increase of 2°C and 4°C above preindustrial levels. For
each timeframe, risk levels are estimated for a continuation of current adaptation and for a hypothetical highly adapted state. Relevant climate variables are indicated by
icons. For a given key risk, change in risk level through time and across magnitudes of climate change is illustrated, but because the assessment considers potential
impacts on different physical, biological, and human systems, risk levels should not necessarily be used to evaluate relative risk across key risks, sectors, or regions.

agriculture in the Murray-Darling Basin (Quiggin et al., 2008, 2010;
Valenzuela and Anderson, 2011; Scealy et al., 2012) and for net health
outcomes (Bambrick et al., 2008). Although quantitative estimates from
individual studies are highly assumption-dependent, multiple lines of
evidence (see Sections 25.7-8) give very high confidence that globally
effective mitigation would significantly reduce many long-term risks
from climate change to Australia. Benefits differ, however, between
States for some issues, for example, heat- and cold-related mortality
(Bambrick et al., 2008). Few studies consider mitigation benefits explicitly
for New Zealand, but scenario-based studies give high confidence that,
if global emissions were reduced from a high (A2) to a medium-
low (B1) emissions scenario, this would markedly lower the projected
increase in flood risks (Ballinger et al., 2011; McMillan et al., 2012) and
reduce risks to livestock production in the most drought-prone regions
(Tait et al., 2008a; Clark et al., 2011). Mitigation would also reduce the
projected benefits to production forestry, however, though amounts
depend on the response to CO, fertilization (Kirschbaum et al., 2011;
see also Section 25.7.1).

"Climate change has the potential to change migration flows within
Australasia, particularly because of coastal changes (e.g., from the Torres
Straits islands to mainland Australia), although reliable estimates of
such movements do not yet exist (see Section 12.4; Green, D. et al.,
2010a; McNamara et al., 2011; Hugo, 2012). Migration within countries,
and from New Zealand to Australia, is largely economically driven and
sustained by transnational networks, though the perceived more attractive
current climate in Australia is reportedly a factor in migration from New
Zealand (Goss and Lindquist, 2000; Green, A.E. et al., 2008; Poot, 2009).
The impacts of climate change in the Pacific may contribute to an increase
in the number of people seeking to move to nearby countries (Bedford
and Bedford, 2010; Hugo, 2010; McAdam, 2010; Farbotko and Lazrus,
2012; Bedford and Campbell, 2013) and affect political stability and
geopolitical rivalry within the Asia-Pacific region, although there is no
clear evidence of this to date and causal theories are scarce (Dupont,
2008; Pearman, 2009; see Sections 12.4-5). Increasing climate-driven
disasters, disease, and border control will stimulate operations other
than war for Australasia's armed forces; integration of security into
adaptation and development assistance for Pacific island countries can
therefore play a key role in moderating the influence of climate change
on forced migration and conflict (robust evidence, high agreement;
Dupont and Pearman, 2006; Bergin and Townsend, 2007; Dupont, 2008;
Sinclair, 2008; Barnett, 2009; Rolfe, 2009).

"Consideration of transformational adaptation becomes critical where
long life- or lead-times are involved, and where high up-front costs or

"A first comparative assessment for Australia of exposure and damages
from different hazards up to 2100 indicates that river flooding will
continue to be the most costly source of direct damages to infrastructure,
even though the largest value of assets is exposed to bush fire. Exposure
to and damages from coastal inundation are currently smaller, but
would rise most rapidly beyond mid-century if sea level rise exceeds
0.5 m (Baynes et al., 2012).

"Climate change is projected to bring benefits to some sectors and parts
of Australasia, at least under limited warming scenarios associated with
globally effective mitigation (high confidence). Examples include an
extended growing season for agriculture and forestry in cooler parts of
New Zealand and Tasmania, reduced winter mortality (low confidence),
and reduced winter energy demand in most of New Zealand and southern
States of Australia, and increased winter hydropower potential in New
Zealand's South Island (Sections 25.7.1-2, 25.7.4, 25.8.1).
"	Text
"Most incremental adaptation measures in natural ecosystems focus on
reducing other non-climate stresses but, even with scaled-up efforts,
conserving the current state and composition of the ecosystems most
at risk appears increasingly infeasible (Sections 25.6.1-2). Maintenance
of key ecosystem functions and services requires a radical reassessment
of conservation values and practices related to assisted colonization
and the values placed on “introduced” species (Steffen et al., 2009).
Divergent views regarding intrinsic and service values of species and
ecosystems imply the need for a proactive discussion to enable effective
decision making and resource allocation.
"	Text
"Two key and related challenges for regional adaptation are apparent:
to identify when and where adaptation may imply transformational
rather than incremental changes; and, where specific interventions are
needed to overcome adaptation constraints, in particular to support
transformational responses that require coordination across different
spheres of governance and decision making (Productivity Commission,
2012; Palutikof et al., 2013). The magnitude of climate change, especially
under scenarios of limited mitigation, and constraints to adaptation
suggest that incremental and autonomous responses will not deliver
the full range of available adaptation options nor ensure the continued
function of natural and human systems if some key risks are realized
(high confidence; see also Section 25.4).
"	Text
"An emerging risk is the compounding of extreme events, none of which
would constitute a key risk in its own right, but that collectively and
cumulatively across space and time could stretch emergency response
and recovery capacity and hamper regional economic development,
including through impacts on insurance markets or multiple concurrent
needs for major infrastructure upgrades (NDIR, 2011; Phelan, 2011;
Baynes et al. 2012; Booth and Williams, 2012; Karoly and Boulter, 2013).
Efforts are underway to better understand the potential importance of
cumulative impacts and responses, including the challenges arising from
impacts and responses across different levels of government (Leonard,
M. et al., 2010; CSIRO, 2011), but evidence is as yet too limited to
identify this as a key risk consistent with the definitions adopted in this
report (see Chapter 19).
"	Text
"In human systems, incremental adjustments of current risk management
tools, planning approaches, and early warning systems for floods, fire,
drought, water resources, and coastal hazards can increase resilience
to climate variability and change, especially in the near term (IPCC, 2012;
Productivity Commission, 2012; Dovers, 2013). A purely incremental
approach, however, which generally aims to preserve current management
objectives, governance, and institutional arrangements, can make later
transformational changes increasingly difficult and costly (medium
evidence, high agreement; e.g., Howden et al., 2010; Park et al., 2012;
McDonald, 2013; Stafford-Smith, 2013). Examples of transformational
changes include: shifting emphasis from protection to accommodation
or avoidance of flood risk, including managed retreat from eroding
coasts; the translocation of industries in response to increasing drought,
flood, and fire risks or water scarcity; and the associated transformation
of the economic and social base and governance of some rural
communities (Boxes 25-1, 25-2, 25-5 to 25-9; Nelson et al., 2010;
Linnenluecke et al., 2011; Kiem and Austin, 2012; O'Neill and Handmer,

"One set of key risks comprises damages to natural ecosystems (significant
change in community structure of coral reefs and loss of some montane
ecosystems) that can be moderated by globally effective mitigation but
to which some damage now seems inevitable. For some species and
ecosystems, climatically constrained ecological niches, fragmented
habitats, and limited adaptive movement collectively present hard limits
to adaptation to further climate change (high confidence). A second set
of key risks (increase in flood risk, water scarcity, heat waves, and
wildfire) comprises damages that could be severe but can be reduced
substantially by globally effective mitigation combined with adaptation,
with the need for transformational adaptation increasing with the rate
and amount of climate change. A third set of key risks (coastal damages
from sea level rise, and loss of agriculture production from severe drying)
comprises potential impacts whose scale remains highly uncertain
within the 21st century, even for a given global temperature change,
and where alternative scenarios materially affect levels of concern,
adaptation needs, and strategies. Even though scenarios of severe drying
(see Section 25.5.2) or rapid sea level rise approaching 1 m or more by
2100 (see Box 25-2; WGI ARS Section 13.5) have low or currently
unknown probabilities, the associated impacts would so severely
challenge adaptive capacity, including transformational changes, that
they constitute important risks.

patterns of natural climate variability, such as ENSO. Better understanding
the effect of evolving natural climate variability and long-term trends,
along with rising CO, concentrations, on pests, invasive species, and
native and managed ecosystems could support more robust ecosystem-
based adaptation strategies.

"These multiple, persistent, and structural uncertainties imply that, in
most cases, adaptation requires an iterative risk management process.
Though decision-support frameworks are being developed, it remains
unclear to what extent existing governance and institutional arrangements
will be able to support more transformational responses, particularly
where competing public and private interests and particularly vulnerable
groups are involved. The enabling or constraining influences on
adaptation from interactions among market forces, institutions,
governance, policy, and regulatory environments have only recently

can present powerful arguments for delayed or staged responses
(Stewart and Wang, 2011; Gorddard et al., 2012; Productivity Commission,

as success or failure of adaptation depends on the extent to which
actors accept a change in, or wish to maintain, current activities and
management objectives, and the degree to which the values and
institutions underpinning the transformation are shared or contested
across stakeholders (Park et al., 2012; Stafford-Smith, 2013). These views
will differ not only between communities and industries but also from
person to person depending on their individual value systems, perceptions
of and attitude to risk, and ability to capitalize on opportunities (see

"The wide range of projected rainfall changes (averages and extremes)
and their hydrological amplification are key uncertainties affecting the
scale and urgency of adaptation in agriculture, forestry, water resources,
some ecosystems, and wildfire and flood risks. For ecosystems, agriculture,
and forestry, these uncertainties are compounded by limited knowledge
of responses of vegetation to elevated CO,, changes in ocean pH, and
interactions with changing climatic conditions. The uncertainties in future
impacts are most critical for decisions with long lifetimes, such as capital
infrastructure investment or large-scale changes in land and water use.
Uncertainties about the rate of sea level rise, and changes in storm
paths and intensity, add to challenges for infrastructure design. The use
of multi-model means and a narrow set of emissions scenarios in many
past studies implies that the full set of climate-related risks and
management options remains incompletely explored.
"	Text
"Our assessment identifies eight key regional risks from climate change. Some impacts, especially on ecosystems,
are by now difficult to avoid entirely. Coral reef systems have a limited ability to adapt naturally to further warming
and an increasingly acidic ocean. Similarly, the habitat for some mountain or high elevation ecosystems and their
associated species is shrinking inexorably with rising temperatures. This implies substantial impacts and some losses
even under scenarios of limited warming. Other risks, however, can be reduced substantially by adaptation, combined
with globally effective mitigation. These include potential flood damages from more extreme rainfall in most parts
of Australia and New Zealand; constraints on water resources from reducing rainfall in southern Australia; increased
health risks and infrastructure damages from heat waves in Australia; and increased economic losses, risks to human
life, and ecosystem damage from wildfires in southern Australia and many parts of New Zealand. A third set of
risks is particularly challenging to manage robustly because the severity of potential impacts varies widely across
the range of climate projections, even for a given temperature increase. These concern damages to coastal
infrastructure and low-lying ecosystems from continuing sea level rise, where damages would be widespread if
sea level turns out to be at the upper end of current scenarios; and threats to agricultural production in both far
southeastern and far southwestern Australia, which would affect ecosystems and rural communities severely at the
dry end of projected rainfall changes. Even though some of these key risks are more likely to materialize than others,
and they differ in the extent that they can be managed by adaptation and mitigation, they all warrant attention
from a risk management perspective, given their potential major consequences for the region.

"Many climate stresses that carry risk—particularly related to severe heat, heavy precipitation, and declining snowpack—will
increase in frequency and/or severity in North America in the next decades (very high confidence). Global warming of approxime

strengthen them, would be more vulnerable to climate change (medium confidence). Water resources and transportation infrastructure
are in many cases deteriorating, thus more vulnerable to extremes than strengthened ones (high confidence). Extreme events have caused
significant damage to infrastructure in many parts of North America; risks to infrastructure are particularly acute in Mexico but are a big
concern in all three countries (high confidence). {26.7}

urban areas and irrigation in North America except in general for southern tropical Mexico, northwest coastal USA, and west coastal Canada

"Effects of temperature and climate variability on yields of major crops have been observed (high confidence). {25.5.1} Projected
increases in temperature, reductions in precipitation in some regions, and increased frequency of extreme events would result in
net productivity declines in major North American crops by the end of the 21st century without adaptation, although the rate of
decline varies by model and scenario, and some regions, particularly in the north, may benefit (very high confidence). {26.5.2}
Given that North America is a significant source of global food supplies, projected productivity declines here may affect global food security
(medium confidence). At 2°C, adaptation has high potential to offset projected declines in yields for many crops, and many strategies offer
mitigation co-benefits; but effectiveness of adaptation would be reduced at 4°C (high confidence). {26.5.3} Adaptation capacity varies widely
among producers, and institutional support—currently lacking in some regions—greatly enhances adaptive potential (medium confidence).

"Most sectors of the North American economy have been affected by and have responded to extreme weather, including hurricanes
flooding, and intense rainfall (high confidence). {Figure 26-2} Despite a growing experience with reactive adaptation, there are few
examples of proactive adaptation anticipating future climate change impacts, and these are largely found in sectors with longer term decision
making, including energy and public infrastructure. Knowledge about lessons learned and best adaptive practices by industry sector are not
well documented in the published literature. {26.7} There is an emerging concern that dislocation in one sector of the economy may have an
adverse impact on other sectors as a result of supply chain interdependency (medium confidence). {26.7} Slow-onset perils—such as SLR,

"Adaptation—including through technological innovation, institutional strengthening, economic diversification, and infrastruct
design—can help to reduce risks in the current climate, and to manage future risks in the face of climate change (medium
confidence). {26.8.4, 26.9.2} There is increasing attention to adaptation among planners at all levels of government but particularly at th
municipal level, with many jurisdictions engaging in assessment and planning processes. These efforts have revealed the significant challenc

financial, and human resources, and lack of political will (medium confidence). {26.8.4.2, 26.9.3} Specific strategies introduced into policy to
date tend to be incremental rather than transformational. Fiscal constraints are higher for Mexican jurisdictions and sectors than for Canadé
the USA. The literature on sectoral-level adaptation is stronger in the areas of technological and engineering adaptation strategies than in soc

"This chapter assesses literature on observed and projected impacts,
vulnerabilities, and risks as well as on adaptation practices and options
in three North American countries: Canada, Mexico, and the USA. The
North American Arctic region is assessed in Chapter 28: Polar Regions.
North America ranges from the tropics to frozen tundra, and contains a
diversity of topography, ecosystems, economies, governance structures,
and cultures. As a result, risk and vulnerability to climate variability and
change differ considerably across the continent depending on geography,
scale, hazard, socio-ecological systems, ecosystems, demographic sectors,
cultural values, and institutional settings. This chapter seeks to take
account of this diversity and complexity as it affects and is projected to
affect vulnerabilities, impacts, risks, and adaptation across North America.
"	Text
"No single chapter would be adequate to cover the range and scope of the
literature about climate change vulnerabilities, impacts, and adaptations
in the three focus countries of this assessment. (Interested readers are
encouraged to review these reports: Lemmen et al., 2008; INECC and
SEMARNAT, 2012a; NCADAC, 2013.) We therefore attempt to take a more
integrative and innovative approach. In addition to describing current and
future climatic and socioeconomic trends of relevance to understanding
risk and vulnerability in North America (Section 26.2), we contrast climate
impacts, vulnerabilities, and adaptations across and within the three
countries in the following key sectors: water resources and management
(Section 26.3); ecosystems and biodiversity (Section 26.4); agriculture
and food security (Section 26.5); human health (Section 26.6); and key
economic sectors and services (Section 26.7). We use a comparative and
place-based approach to explore the factors and processes associated
with differences and commonalities in vulnerability, risk, and adaptation
between urban and rural settlements (Section 26.8); and to illustrate
and contrast the nuanced challenges and opportunities adaption entails
at the city, subnational, and national levels (Sections 26.8.4, 26.9; Box
26-3). We highlight two case studies that cut across sectors, systems, or
national boundaries. The first, on wildfires (Box 26-2), explores some of
the connections between climatic and physical and socioeconomic
process (e.g., decadal climatic oscillation, droughts, wildfires land use,
and forest management) and across systems and sectors (e,g., fires direct
and indirect impacts on local economies, livelihoods, built environments,
and human health). The second takes a look at one of the world’s
longest borders between a high-income (USA) and middle-income
country (Mexico) and briefly reflects on the challenges and opportunities
of responding to climate change in a transboundary context (Box 26-1).
We close with a section (26.10) summarizing key multi-sectoral risks
and uncertainties and discussing some of the knowledge gaps that will
need to be filled by future research.
"	Text
"on future risks in the following sectors:

 

Ecosystems: Both AR4 and our chapter find that ecosystems are under
increased stress from increased temperatures, climate variability,
and other climate stresses (e.g., sea level rise (SLR) and storm-surge
flooding), and that these stresses interact with developmental and
environmental stresses (e.g., as salt intrusion, pollution, population
growth, and the rising value of infrastructure in coastal areas) (WGIl
AR4 Sections 13.4.4, 14.2.3, 14.4.3). Differential capacities for range
shifts and constraints from development, habitat fragmentation,
invasive species, and broken ecological connections would alter
ecosystem structure, function, and services in terrestrial ecosystems
(WGII AR4 Sections 14.2, 14.4). Both reports show that dry soils
and warm temperatures are associated with increased wildfire
activity and insect outbreaks in Canada and the USA (WGII AR4
Sections 14.2, 14.4; Section 26.4.2.1).

Water resources: AR4 projects millions in Mexico to be at risk from
the lack of adequate water supplies due to climate change (WGII AR4
Section 13.4.3); our chapter, however, finds that water resources
are already stressed by non-climatic factors, such as population
pressure that will be compounded by climate change (Section 26.3.1).
Both reports find that in the USA and Canada rising temperatures
would diminish snowpack and increase evaporation (Section 26.2.2.1),
thus affecting seasonal availability of water (WGII AR4 Section
14.2.1; Section 26.3.1). The reports also agree that these effects
will be amplified by water demand from economic development,
agriculture, and population growth, thus imposing further constraints
to over-allocated water resources and increasing competition
among agricultural, municipal, industrial, and ecological uses (WGIl
AR4 Sections 14.4.1, 14.4.6; Section 26.3.3). Both agree water quality
will be further stressed (WGIl AR4 Sections 13.4.3, 14.4.1; Section
26.3.2.2). There is more information available now on water
adaptation than in AR4 (WGII AR4 Sections 13.5.1.3, 14.5.1;
Section 26.3.3), and it is possible to attribute changes in extreme
precipitation, snowmelt, and snowpack to climate change (WGIl
AR4 Sections 13.2.4, 14.2.1; Section 26.3.1).

Agriculture: The AR4 noted that while increases in grain yields in
the USA and Canada are projected by most scenarios (WGII AR4
Section 14.4.4), in Mexico the picture is mixed for wheat and maize,
with different projected impacts depending on scenario used (WGII
AR4 Section 13.4.2). Research since the AR4 has offered more
cautious projections of yield change in North America due to shifts
in temperature and precipitation, particularly by 2100; and significant
harvest losses due to recent extreme weather events have been
observed (Section 26.5.1). Furthermore, our chapter reports on recent
research that underscores the context-specific nature of adaptation

include changes in the geographical distribution and transmission
of diseases such as dengue (WGIl AR4 Section 13.4.5) and increases
in respiratory illness, including exposure to pollen and ozone (WGIl

"Canada, Mexico, and USA share commonalities but also differ in key
dimensions shaping risk, vulnerability, and adaptation such as population
dynamics, economic development, and institutional capacity. During the
last years, the three countries, particularly the USA, have suffered economic
losses from extreme weather events (Figure 26-2). Hurricanes, droughts,
floods, and other climate-related hazards produce risk as they interact
with increases in exposed populations, infrastructure, and other assets
and with the dynamics of such factors shaping vulnerability as wealth,
population size and structure, and poverty (Figures 26-2 and SPM.1).
Population growth has been slower in Canada and USA than in Mexico

of recorded precipitation patterns for the area (Cayan et al., 2010; Seager and Vecchi, 2010; Nielsen-Gammon, 2011). Streamflow in
already oversubscribed rivers such as the Colorado and Rio Grande (Nakaegawa et al., 2013) has decreased. Climatological conditions
for the area have been unprecedented, with sustained high temperatures that may have exceeded any experienced for 1200 years.
Although these changes cannot conclusively be attributed to anthropogenic climate change, they are consistent with climate change

"as early warning and surveillance systems, air conditioning, and
access to health care, hot temperatures and extreme weather in
Canada and the USA are predicted to result in increased adverse
health impacts (WGII AR4 Sections 14.4-5). Our chapter provides
a more detailed assessment of these future risks (Section 26.6),
besides assessing a richer literature on observed health impacts
(Section 26.6.1).

Adaptation: AR4 found that Mexico has early warning and risk
management systems, yet it faces planning and management barriers.
In Canada and the USA, a decentralized response framework has
resulted in adaptation that tends to be reactive, unevenly distributed,
and focused on coping with rather than preventing problems (WGI
AR4 Section 14.5). Both chapters see “mainstreaming” climate issues
into decision making as key to successful adaptation (WGII AR4
Sections 13.5, 14.5). The current chapter provides a summary of
the growing empirical literature on emerging opportunities and
constraints associated with recent institutional adaptation planning
activities since the AR4 (Sections 26.3.3, 26.4.4, 26.5.4, 26.6.3,

"sectors in urban areas can be a source of risk, geographic isolation and
high dispersion of rural populations also introduce risk because of long
distances to essential services (Section 26.8.2). Rural populations are
more vulnerable to climate events due to smaller labor markets, lower
income levels, and reduced access to public services. Rural poverty could
also be aggravated by changes in agricultural productivity, particularly
in Mexico, where 65% of the rural population is poor, agricultural income
is seasonal, and most households lack insurance (Scott, 2007). Food price
increases, which may also result from climate events, would contribute
to food insecurity (Lobell et al., 2011; World Bank, 2011).

"The impacts of regional climatic and non-climatic stresses compound existing urban vulnerabilities that are different across countries.
For instance, besides degrading highly diverse ecosystems (Wilder et al., 2013), residential growth in flood-prone areas in Ciudad
Juarez has not been complemented with the provision of determinants of adaptive capacity to residents, such as housing, health
care, and drainage infrastructure. As a result, although differences in mean hazard scores are not significant between Ciudad Juarez

(Mexico) and El Paso (USA), social vulnerability and average risk are three times and two times higher in Ciudad Juarez than in El
Paso respectively (Collins, 2008).

"Adaptation opportunities and constraints are shared across international borders, creating the need for cooperation among local,
national, and international actors. Although there are examples of efforts to manage transborder environmental issues, such as the
USA-Mexico International Boundary and Water Commission agreement (United States and Mexico International Boundary and Water
Commission, 2012), constraints to effective cooperation and collaboration include different governance structures (centralized in

Mexico, decentralized in the USA), institutional fragmentation, asymmetries in the use and dissemination of information, and language
(Wilder et al., 2010, 2013; Megdal and Scott, 2011).
"	Text
"Notwithstanding this growth, challenges to adaptive capacity include high rates of poverty in a landscape of uneven economic
development (Wilder et al., 2013). Large sections of the urban population, particularly in Mexico, live in informal housing lacking the
health and safety standards needed to respond to hazards, and with no insurance (Collins et al., 2011). Any effort to increase regional
capacity to respond to climate needs to take existing gaps into account. In addition, there is a prevalence of incipient or actual conflict
(Mumme, 1999), given by currently or historically contested allocation of land and water resources (e.g., an over-allocated Colorado
River ending in Mexico above the Sea de Cortes (Getches, 2003)). Climate change, therefore, would bring additional significant
consequences for the region’s water resources, ecosystems, and rural and urban settlements.

faster than rural populations, resulting in a North America that is highly
urbanized (Canada 84.8%, Mexico 82.8%, and USA 85.8%). Urban
populations are also expanding into peri-urban spaces, producing rapid
changes in population and land use dynamics that can exacerbate risks
from such hazards as floods and wildfires (Eakin et al., 2010; Romero-
Lankao et al., 2012a). Mexico has a markedly higher poverty rate (34.8%)
than Canada (9.1%) and the USA (12.5%) (Figure 26-2), with weather
events and climate affecting poor people’s livelihood assets, including
crop yields, homes, food security, and sense of place (Chapter 13;

"Figure 26-2 | Extreme events illustrating vulnerabilities for Mexico, the USA, and Canada. This figure offers a graphic illustration of location of extreme events and relevant
vulnerability trends. The observed extreme events have not been attributed to anthropogenic climate change, yet they are climate-sensitive sources of impact illustrating vulnerability
of exposed systems, particularly if projected future increases in the frequency and/or intensity of such events should materialize. The figure contains three elements. (a) A map with
significant weather and climate events taking place during 1993-2012 (data derived from NatCatSERVICE, 2013). The categories “Severe storm” and “Winter storm” are
aggregations of multiple types of storms; e.g., hailstorms are shown as Winter storms and tornadoes as Severe storms. Boxed numbers refer to the years in which the extreme events
occurred. Hurricanes are placed offshore of the point of initial landfall, and placement of all other boxes (which may span multiple subnational jurisdictions) is weighted towards areas
with the highest expected impacts (defined by estimated affected populations when finer subnational detail was not available). The map includes only events with overall losses =
US$1 billion in the USA, or >US$500 million in Mexico and Canada, adjusted to 2012 values; hence, it does not include events of small and medium impact. Additionally, losses do
not capture the impacts of disasters on populations’ livelihoods and well-being. (b) A map (facing page) with population density per ~0.0083° gridbox at 1-km resolution highlighting

Newsome et al., 2012). Numbers of single-person households and female-
headed households—both of which are vulnerable because of low

numbers of vulnerable populations may also be limited, with resulting
stress on health and the economy.

"It is very likely that mean annual temperature has increased over the
past century over most of North America (WGI AR5 Figure SPM.1b;
Figure 26-3). Observations also show increases in the occurrence of
severe hot events over the USA over the late 20th century (Kunkel et
al., 2008), a result in agreement with observed late-20th-century
increases in extremely hot seasons over a region encompassing
northern Mexico, the USA, and parts of eastern Canada (Diffenbaugh and
Scherer, 2011). These increases in hot extremes have been accompanied
by observed decreases in frost days over much of North America
(Alexander et al., 2006; Brown et al., 2010; see also WGI ARS Section
2.6.1), decreases in cold spells over the USA (Kunkel et al., 2008; see
also WGI ARS Section 2.6.1), and increasing ratio of record high to low
daily temperatures over the USA (Meehl et al., 2009). However, warming
has been less pronounced and less robust over areas of the central and
southeastern USA (e.g., Alexander et al., 2006; Peterson et al., 2008;
see also WGI ARS Section 2.6.1; WGI AR5 Figure SPM.1b; Figure 26-3).
It is possible that this pattern of muted temperature change has been
influenced by changes in the hydrologic cycle (e.g., Pan et al., 2004;
Portmann et al., 2009), as well as by decadal-scale variability in the
ocean (e.g., Meehl et al, 2012; Kumar et al., 2013b).

"Three other shifts are projected to influence impacts, vulnerabilities, and
adaptation to climate change in North America: urbanization, migration,
and socioeconomic disparity. With small differences between countries,
both the concentration of growing populations in some urban areas and
the dispersion of rural populations are projected to continue to define
North America by 2050. Assuming no change in climate, between 2005
and 2030 the population of Mexico City Metro Area will increase by
17.5%, while between 2007 and 2030 available water will diminish by
11.2% (Romero-Lankao, 2010). Conversely, education, a key determinant
of adaptive capacity (Chapter 13), is expected to expand to low-income
households, minorities, and women, which could increase the coping
capacity of households and have a positive impact on economic growth
(Goujon et al., 2004). However, the continuation of current patterns of
economic disparity and poverty would hinder future adaptive capacity.
Inequality in Mexico is larger (Figure 26-2), having a Gini coefficient
(according to which the higher the number the higher economic disparity)
of 0.56, in contrast to 0.317 for Canada and 0.389 for the USA (OECD,
2010). Mexico is one of five countries in the world that is projected to
experience the highest increases in poverty due to climate-induced
extreme events (52% increase in rural households, 95.4% in urban wage-
labor households; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3
(CMIP3), A2) (Ahmed et al., 2009).

"It is very likely that annual precipitation has increased over the past
century over areas of the eastern USA and Pacific Northwest (WGI ARS
Figure 2.29; Figure 26-3). Observations also show increases in heavy
precipitation over Mexico, the USA, and Canada between the mid-20th
and the early 21st century (DeGaetano, 2009; Peterson and Baringer,
2009; Pryor et al., 2009; see also WGI ARS Section 2.6.2). Observational
analyses of changes in drought are more equivocal over North America,
with mixed sign of trend in dryness over Mexico, the USA, and Canada
(Dai, 2011; Sheffield et al., 2012; see also WGI AR5 Section 2.6.2; WGI
ARS Figure 2.42). There is also evidence for earlier occurrence of peak
flow in snow-dominated rivers globally (Rosenzweig, 2007; WGI AR5
Section 2.6.2). Observed snowpack and snow-dominated runoff have
been extensively studied in the western USA and western Canada, with
observations showing primarily decreasing trends in the amount of
water stored in spring snowpack from 1960 to 2002 (with the most
prominent exception being the central and southern Sierra Nevada;
Mote, 2006) and primarily earlier trends in the timing of peak runoff over
the 1948-2000 period (Stewart et al., 2006; WGI ARS Section 4.5; WGI
ARS Figure 4.21). Observations also show decreasing mass and length
of glaciers in North America (WGI AR5 Section 4.3; WGI ARS Figures
4.9, 4.10, 4.11). Further, in assessing changes in the hydrology of the
western USA, it has been concluded that “up to 60% of the climate-related
trends of river flow, winter air temperature, and snowpack between
1950 and 1999 are human-induced” (Barnett et al., 2008, p. 1080).

"A number of ecosystems in North America are vulnerable to climate
change. For example, species in alpine ecosystems are at high risk due
to limited geographic space into which to expand (Villers Ruiz and

wildfire and large-scale mortality and infestation events (Section 26.4.1).
Across the continent, potentially rapid rates of climate change may
require location shifts at velocities well outside the range in historical
reconstructions (Sandel et al., 2011; Schloss et al., 2012). Changes in
temperature, precipitation amount, and CO, concentrations can have
different effects across species and ecological communities (Parmesan,

"Recent research has documented gradual changes in physiology,
phenology, and distributions in North American ecosystems consistent

to anthropogenic climate change via joint attribution (Root et al., 2005;

"Wildfire is a natural process, critical to nutrient cycling, controlling populations of pests and pathogens, biodiversity, and fire-adapted
species (Bond and Van Wilgen, 1996). However, since the mid-1980s large wildfire activity in North America has been marked by
increased frequency and duration, and longer wildfire seasons (Westerling et al., 2006; Williamson et al., 2009). Recent wildfires in
western Canada, the USA, and Mexico relate to long and warm spring and summer droughts, particularly when they are accompanied
by winds (Holden et al., 2007; Comision Nacional Forestal, 2012b). Interacting processes such as land use changes associated with
the expansion of settlements and activities in peri-urban areas or forested areas, combined with the legacies of historic forest

"Drought conditions are strongly associated with wildfire occurrence, as dead fuels such as needles and dried stems promote the
incidence of firebrands and spot fires (Keeley and Zedler, 2009; Liu et al., 2012). Drought trends vary across regions (Groisman et ;
2007; Girardin et al., 2012): The western USA has experienced drier conditions since the 1970s (Peterson et al., 2013); drought peric
in Alberta and Idaho have coincided with large burned areas (Pierce and Meyer, 2008; Kulshreshtha, 2011); and heterogeneous
patterns of drought severity and a reduction of wildfire risk have been detected for the circumboreal region (Girardin et al., 2009)
Decadal climatic oscillations also contribute to differences in drought, and thus in wildfire occurrences. The areas burned in the
continent boreal forest and in northwest and central Mexico correlate with the dynamics of seasonal land/ocean temperature
variability (Macias Fauria and Johnson, 2006; Skinner et al., 2006; Villers Ruiz and Hernandez-Lozano, 2007; Girardin and Sauchyn
2008; Macias Fauria and Johnson, 2008), which is shifting toward hotter temperatures and longer droughts. Such human practice

"Minimizing adverse effects of wildfires involves short- and long-term strategies such as planned manipulation of vegetation composition
and stand structure (Girardin et al., 2012; Terrier et al, 2013), suppression of fires where required, fuel treatments, use of fire-safe
materials in construction, community planning, and reduction of arson. Not all negative consequences of fire can be avoided, though
a mixture of techniques can be used to minimize adverse effects (Girardin et al., 2012). Prescribed fire may be an important tool for
managing fire risk in Canada and the USA (Hurteau and North, 2010; Wiedinmyer and Hurteau, 2010; Hurteau et al., 2011). Managers
in the USA have encouraged reduction of flammable vegetation around structures with different levels of success (Stewart et al.,

resource dependence; community composition; and the risk perceptions, attitudes, and beliefs of decision makers, private property
owners, and affected populations (McFarlane, 2006; Repetto, 2008; Collins and Bolin, 2009; Martin et al., 2009; Trainor et al., 2009;

also project increasing interannual yield variability over time (Sakurai

2009; Soto-Pinto and Anzueto, 2010). Other strategies specifically
recommended for Mexico include soil remediation, improved use of
climate information, rainwater capture, and drip irrigation (Sosa-

productivity risks posed by climate change (Hatfield et al., 2013).
Incremental strategies will have reduced effectiveness under a 2099/4°C

adverse health effects in many locations in North America (Romero-Lankao

and eventual deposition of air pollutants all can be influenced by
meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed
and direction, and mixing height (Kinney, 2008). Although air pollution
emission trends will play a dominant role in future pollution levels,
climate change may make it harder to achieve some air quality goals
(Jacob and Winner, 2009). Forest fire is a source of particle emissions in
North America, and can lead to increased cardiac and respiratory
disease incidence, as well as direct mortality (Rittmaster et al., 2006;
Ebi et al., 2008). The indoor environment also can affect health in many
ways, for example, via penetration of outdoor pollution, emissions or
pollutants indoors, moisture-related problems, and transmission of
respiratory infections. Indoor moisture leads to mold growth, a problem
that is exacerbated in colder regions such as northern North America
in the winter (Potera, 2011). Climate variability and change will affect
indoor air quality, but with direction and magnitude that remains largely
unknown (Institute of Medicine, 2011).

Affordable adaptation in design and construction practices could reduce

involving reform in building codes and other standards (Kelly et al.,

increased conflicts over water between sectors and regions, and affect
the ability of regions to attract new facilities or retain existing operations.
A study of the effect of changes in precipitation (A1B scenario) on 70

management practices to deal with short-term water shortages, including
reducing water intake, increasing recycling, and establishing infrastructure
to move water from tailing ponds, pits, and quarries, have worked
successfully in the past (Chiotti and Lavender, 2008). Integrating climate

and infrastructure, which include vulnerability of transport systems,
increased maintenance costs, and disruptions due to extreme events
(NRTEE, 2012). Air conditioning is a viable and effective adaptation
option to address some of the impacts of warming, though it does

sensitive sectors to weather in the USA (Lazo et al., 2011). Weather affects
the supply of raw material, production process, transportation of goods,

in North America experienced production losses associated with shortages
of components due to flooding in Thailand (Kim, 2011). In 2013, reduced
cattle supply and higher feed prices associated with drought in Texas
led to a decision to close a beef processing plant (Beef Today Editors,
2013). Drought also caused delays for barge shipping on the Mississippi
River in 2012 (Polansek, 2012). Major storms, like Hurricanes Sandy,
Katrina, and Andrew, significantly disrupted manufacturing activities,
including plant shutdowns due to direct damages and/or loss of
electricity and supply disruptions due to unavailability of parts, and
difficulties delivering products due to compromised transportation
networks (Baade et al., 2007; Dolfman et al., 2007).

claims paid has been attributed to increasing exposure of people and
assets in areas of risk (Pielke, Jr. et al., 2008; Barthel and Neumayer,

"Without adaptation, there is an expectation that severe weather insurance
damage claims would increase significantly over the next several
decades across North America (World Bank, 2010). The risk of damage
is expected to rise due to continuing growth in wealth, the population

weather perils in North America will increase in severity, including
Atlantic hurricanes and the area burned by wildfire (Karl et al., 2008;
Balshi et al., 2009), and other perils in frequency, including intense

but in most markets across North America there has been little change
in building practices. The cost of adaptation measures combined with
limited long-term liability for future buildings has influenced some
builders to take a wait-and-see attitude (Morton et al., 2011). Exploratory

"Arecent study of more than 2000 major catastrophes since 1960 found
that insurance is a critical adaptive tool available to help society minimize
the adverse economic consequences of natural disasters (von Peter et

USA have been affected by recent hurricanes and previously subsidized
premiums have been changed to more accurately reflect risk (FEMA,
2013). In the USA and Canada, homeowners make extensive use of
insurance to manage a broad range of risks, and those with insurance
recover quickly following most extreme weather events. However, the
majority of public infrastructure is not insured and it frequently takes
more than a decade before government services fully recover. In contrast,
Mexico has a well-developed program for financing the rebuilding of
public infrastructure following a disaster (Fondo de Desastres Naturales
(FONDEN)) but insurance markets are only beginning to emerge for
homeowners and businesses. In 2012, per capita spending on property
and casualty insurance was US$2239.20 in the USA, US$2040.40 in
Canada, and US$113.00 in Mexico (Swiss Re, 2013).

than others. Human settlements simultaneously face a multi-level array
of non-climate-related hazards (e.g., economic, industrial, technological)
that contribute to climate change vulnerability (McGranahan et al.,

"Risks may also be heightened by multiple interacting hazards. Slow-
onset events such as urban heat islands, for instance, interact with poor
air quality in large North American cities to exacerbate climate impacts
on human health (Romero-Lankao et al., 2013a). As illustrated by recent
weather events (Figure 26-2), however, hazard interactions can also
follow individual, high-magnitude extreme events of short duration, with
cascading effects across interconnected energy, transportation, water,
and health infrastructures and services to contribute to and compound
urban vulnerability (Gasper et al., 2011). Wildfire vulnerability in the
southwest has been compounded by peri-urban growth (Collins and
Bolin, 2009; Brenkert-Smith, 2010). Under current financial constraints
in many cities, climate-related economic losses can reduce resources
available to address social issues, thus threatening institutional capacity

"While droughts are among the more notable extreme events affecting
North American urban and rural settlements recently, with severe
occurrences in the Canadian Prairies causing economic and employment
losses (2001-2002; Wheaton et al., 2007), changes in drought frequency
in North America have not been attributed to anthropogenic climate
change (Figure 26-1). The 2010-2012 drought across much of the USA
and northern Mexico was considered the most severe in a century
(MacDonald, 2010). It affected 80% of agricultural land in the USA,
with 2000 counties designated disaster zones by September (USDA ERS,

placing 2.5 million at risk of food insecurity (DGCS, 2012). Among the
most severely affected were indigenous peoples, such as the Raramuri
of Chihuahua (DGCS, 2012). Closely associated with droughts, the

have intensified inequalities in vulnerability between amenity migrants
and low-income residents in peri-urban areas of California and Colorado
(Collins and Bolin, 2009).

"Extreme storms and extreme precipitation have also impacted several
North American regions (Figures 26-1, 26-2). Flood frequency has
increased in some cities, a trend sometimes associated with more intense
precipitation (e.g., Mexico City and Charlotte, North Carolina, USA;
Villarini et al., 2009; Magana, 2010), while in others this trend is
associated with a transition from flood events dominated by snowmelt
to those caused by warm-season thunderstorms (e.g., Québec, Canada,
and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA; Ouellet et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2013).
As illustrated by Hurricane Sandy (Neria and Shultz, 2012; Powell et al.,

and water use (Cuo et al., 2009). Urbanization also has significant impacts
on flood climatology through atmospheric processes tied to the urban heat
island (UHI), the urban canopy layer (UCL), and the aerosol composition
of airsheds (Ntelekos et al., 2010). The UHI can also increase health risks

if drainage or waste collection systems are inadequate to accommodate
peak flows (Richardson, 2010; Sosa-Rodriguez, 2010). While many
Canadian and US cities are in need of infrastructure adaptation upgrades
(Doyle et al., 2008; Conrad, 2010), Mexican cites are faced with existing
infrastructure deficits (Niven et al., 2010; Hardoy and Romero-Lankao,

these assets shape response capacities (Harlan and Ruddell, 2011;
Romero-Lankao et al., 201 3a). All this means that class and socio-spatial
segregation are key determinants not only of vulnerability but also of
inequalities in risk generation and distribution within cities. Economic
elites are better positioned to access the best land and enjoy the rewards
of environmental amenities such as clean air, safe drinking water, open
space, and tree shade (Morello-Frosch et al., 2002; Harlan et al., 2006,

climate hazards (Daw et al., 2009). Single-sector economic dependence
contributes significantly to vulnerability (Cutter et al., 2003). Engagement
in export markets presents opportunity but also exposure to economic
volatility (Eakin, 2006; Saldafia-Zorilla and Sandberg, 2009), and economic
downturns take attention away from climate change adaptation. Farming

communities, including rapid population growth or loss, reduced
employment, and degradation of local knowledge systems, can increase

lower income and unemployed populations and higher poverty than
cities (Whitener and Parker, 2007; Lal et al., 2011; Skoufias et al., 2011).
55% of Mexico’s rural residents live in poverty, and the livelihood of
72% of these is in farming (Saldafia-Zorrilla, 2008). US and Canadian
rural communities have older populations (McLeman, 2010) and lower
education levels (Lal et al., 2011). Indigenous communities have lower
education levels and high levels of poverty, but are younger than average

flood-prone deltas, and arid regions (Kirshen et al., 2008; Nicholls et al.,

this century, New York City is projected to experience nearly twice as many
extreme precipitation days compared to today (A2, mean ensemble of

increase in the number and duration of droughts in the southwestern
USA, with most droughts expected to last more than 5 years by 2050

in metropolitan Boston are estimated to exceed US$57 billion by 2100,

decisions. The evolution of cities as economic hubs, for example, affects
vulnerability and resilience (Leichenko, 2011). Urban expansion into

fiscal constraints necessary to support public services, including
emergency personnel and health care (Lal et al., 2011). Although
large cities tend to have greater fiscal capacity, most do not receive
financial support for adaptation (Carmin et al., 2012), yet face the

"	Title
"With populations of 20.5, 14, and 2.3 million people, respectively, the metropolitan areas of Mexico City, New York, and Vancouver
are facing multiple risks that climate change is projected to aggravate. These risks range from sea level rise, coastal flooding, and
storm surges in New York and Vancouver to heat waves, heavy rains and associated flooding, air pollution, and heat island effects in
all three cities (Leon and Neri, 2010; Rosenzweig and Solecki, 2010; City of Vancouver, 2012). Many of these risks result not only
from long-term global and regional processes of environmental change, but also from local changes in land and water uses and in
atmospheric emissions induced by urbanization (Leon and Neri, 2010; Romero-Lankao, 2010; Kinney et al., 2011; Solecki, 2012).
"	Text
"Climate responses require new types of localized scientific information, such as vulnerability analyses and flood risk assessments,
which are not always available (Romero-Lankao et al., 2012a; Ray et al., 2013). Little is known, for instance, about how to predict
and respond to common and differential levels of risk experienced by different human settlements. Comprehensive planning is still
limited as well. For example, although scholarship exists on disparities in household- and population-level vulnerability and adaptive
capacity (Cutter et al., 2003; Villeneuve and Burnett, 2003; Douglas et al., 2012; Romero-Lankao et al., 2013b), equity concerns have
received relatively less attention by the three cities. Even when local needs are identified, such as the need to protect higher risk
homeless and low-income populations (Vancouver), they are often not addressed in action plans.

"The three cities have been frontrunners in the climate arena. In Mexico City, the Program of Climate Action 2008-2012 (PAC) and the
2011 Law for Mitigation and Adaptation to Climate Change are parts of a larger 15-year “Green Agenda,” with most of designated
funds committed to reducing 7 million tonnes of CO,-equivalent by 2012 (Romero-Lankao et al., 2013). New York City and Vancouver's
plans are similarly mitigation centered. As of 2007 New York's long-term sustainability plan included adaptation (Solecki, 2012; Ray
et al., 2013), while Vancouver launched its municipal adaptation plan in July 2012. The shifts in focus from mitigation to adaptation
have followed as it has become increasingly clear that even if mitigation efforts are wholly successful, some adverse impacts due to
climate change are unavoidable.

"Urban leaders in all three cities have emerged as global leaders in sustainability. Mayor Bloomberg of New York, Mayor Ebrard of Mexico
City, and David Cadman of Vancouver have, respectively, led the C40, World Mayors Council on Climate Change, and International
Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEl). Scientists, private sector actors, and non-governmental organizations have been of
no lesser importance. To take advantage of a broad-based interaction between various climate change actors, Mexico City has set up
a Virtual Climate Change Center to serve as a repository of knowledge, models, and data on climate change impacts, vulnerability,
and risks (Romero-Lankao et al., 2013a). Information sharing by climate change actors has also taken place in New York, where
scientists and insurance and risk management experts have served on the Panel on Climate Change to advise the city on the science
of climate change impacts and “protection levels specific to the city's critical infrastructure” (Solecki, 2012, p. 564).

"The climate plans of the three cities are far reaching, including mitigation and adaptation strategies related to their sustainability goals.
The three cities emphasize different priorities in their climate action plans. Mexico City seeks to reduce water consumption and
transportation emissions through such actions as improvements in infrastructure and changes in the share of public transport. Vancouv
has prioritized the separation of sanitary and storm water systems, yet this adaptation is not expected to be complete until 2050 (City c
Vancouver, 2012). It will also take New York much time, money, and energy to expand adaptation strategies beyond the protection of
water systems to include all essential city infrastructure (Ray et al, 2013). Overall, few proposed actions will result in immediate effects
and instead call for additional planning, highlighting the significant effort necessary for comprehensive responses. Overall, adaptation
planning in the three cities faces many challenges. In all three regions, multi-jurisdictional governance structures with differing approache
to climate change challenge the ability for coordinated responses (Solecki, 2012; Romero-Lankao et al., 2013a). Conflicts in priorities an
objectives between various actors and sectors are also prevalent (Burch, 2010). For instance, authorities in Mexico City concerned with
avoiding growth into risk-prone and conservation areas (Aguilar and Santos, 2011) compete for regulatory space within a policy agend.

capacity to adapt, there are significant constraints on adaptation, with
financing being a significant constraint in all three countries (Carmin et

countries such as the USA tend to address hazards and propose
adaptations that tend to protect current activities rather than facilitate
long-term change. In addition, the adaptation plans generally do not
attempt to increase adaptive capacity (Eakin and Patt, 2011). However,

"how multiple climate change impacts can affect these large areas.
However, this macro view gives insufficient detail on context-specific
local impacts and risks, missing the on-the-ground reality that the effects
of climate change are and will be experienced at much smaller scales,
and those smaller scales are often where meaningful mitigation and
adaptation actions can be generated. To give local actors relevant
information on which to base these local actions, more research is needed
to understand better the local and regional effects of climate change
across sectors.

"Many decision makers, particularly in the USA and Canada, have the financial, human, and institutional capacity
to invest in resilience, yet a trend of rising losses from extremes has been evident across the continent (Figure 26-2),
largely due to socioeconomic factors, including a growing population, equity issues, and increased property value
in areas of high exposure. In addition, climate change is very likely to lead to more frequent extreme heat events
and daily precipitation extremes over most areas of North America, more frequent low snow years, and shifts toward
earlier snowmelt runoff over much of the western USA and Canada (high confidence). These changes combined
with higher sea levels and associated storm surges, more intense droughts, and increased precipitation variability
are projected to lead to increased stresses to water, agriculture, economic activities, and urban and rural settlements
(high confidence).

"Recent climate changes and extreme events such as floods and droughts depicted in Figure 26-2 demonstrate clear
impacts of climate-related stresses in North America (high confidence). There has been increased occurrence of severe
hot weather events over much of the USA and increases in heavy precipitation over much of North America (high
confidence). Such events as droughts in northern Mexico and south-central USA, floods in Canada, and hurricanes
such as Sandy demonstrate exposure and vulnerability to extreme climate (high confidence). Many urban and rural
settlements, agricultural production, water supplies, and human health have been observed to be vulnerable to
these and other extreme weather events (Figure 26-2). Forest ecosystems have been stressed through wildfire
activity, regional drought, high temperatures, and infestations, while aquatic ecosystems are being affected by
higher temperatures and sea level rise.

"Adaptation—including land use planning, investments in infrastructure, emergency management, health programs,
and water conservation—has significant capacity to reduce risks from current climate and climate change (Figure
26-3). There is increasing attention to adaptation among planners at all levels of government but particularly at
the municipal level, with many jurisdictions engaging in assessment and planning processes. Yet, there are few
documented examples of implementation of proactive adaptation and these are largely found in sectors with longer
term decision making, including energy and public infrastructure (high confidence). Adaptation efforts have revealed
the significant challenges and sources of resistance facing planners at both the planning and implementation stages,
particularly the adequacy of informational, institutional, financial, and human resources, and lack of political will
(medium confidence). While there is high capacity to adapt to climate change across much of North America, there
are regional and sectoral disparities in economic resources, governance capacity, and access to and ability to utilize
information on climate change, which limit adaptive capacity in many regions and among many populations such
as the poor and Indigenous communities. For example, there is limited capacity for many species to adapt to climate
change, even with human intervention. At lower levels of temperature rise, adaptation has high potential to offset
projected declines in yields for many crops, but this effectiveness is expected to be much lower at higher temperatures.
The risk that climate stresses will cause profound impacts on ecosystems and society—including the possibility of
species extinction or severe adverse socioeconomic shocks—highlights limits to adaptation.

"Conversion of natural ecosystems is the main cause of biodiversity and ecosystem loss in the region, and is a driver of
anthropogenic climate change (high confidence). Climate change is expected to increase the rates of species extinction (medium

Brazil, distribution of some groups of birds and plants will be dislocated southward, where there are fewer natural habitats remaining. However,
CA and SA have still large extensions of natural vegetation cover for which the Amazon is the main example. {27.3.2.1} Ecosystem-based

coral bleaching events associated with ocean warming and acidification occur in the Mesoamerican Coral Reef. In CA and SA, the main drivers
of mangrove loss are deforestation and land conversion to agriculture and shrimp ponds. {27.3.3.1} Brazilian fisheries’ co-management (a

"In many CA and SA countries, a first step toward adaptation to future climate changes is to reduce the vulnerability to present
climate. Long-term planning and the related human and financial resource needs may be seen as conflicting with the present social deficit in
the welfare of the CA and SA population. Various examples demonstrate possible synergies between development, adaptation, and mitigation
planning, which can help local communities and governments to allocate efficiently available resources in the design of strategies to reduce
vulnerability. However, the generalization of such actions at a continental scale requires that both the CA and SA citizens and governments
address the challenge of building a new governance model, where imperative development needs, vulnerability reduction, and adaptation
strategies to climate stresses will be truly intertwined. {27.3.4, 27.4-5}

production in the future, as long as policies toward adaptation to global
climate change will be strategically designed. The region is already one

subsistence agriculture in northeast Brazil), and the implementation of
disease surveillance systems (e.g., Colombia) (WGII AR4 Chapter 13, p.

capabilities. In other regions, such as Amazonia (insufficient evidence),
inconsistencies among studies and detected trends result in low

increase over most of SA, with a weaker tendency toward increasing in
SESA. With low confidence, the models also project an increase of the
proportion of total rainfall from heavy falls for SESA and the west coast
of SA, while for Amazonia and the rest of SA and CA there are not
consistent signals of change. In some regions, there is low confidence
in projections of changes in fluvial floods. Confidence is low owing to
limited evidence and because the causes of regional changes are complex.
There is medium confidence that droughts will intensify along the 21st

Simultaneously, a reduction in the number of dry months in the warm

increasing in SESA (references in Table 27-1). In SESA, increases in
precipitation are responsible for changes in soil moisture (Collini et al.,
2008; Saulo et al., 2010), and although feedback mechanisms are
present at all scales, the effect on atmospheric circulation is detected
at large scales. Moreover, land use change studies in the Brazilian

"detected (Marengo et al., 2009a). In the northern Andes (Colombia,
Ecuador), changes in temperature and rainfall in 1961-1990 have been
identified by Villacis (2008). In the Patagonia region, Masiokas et al.
(2008) have identified an increase of temperature together with
precipitation reductions during 1912-2002. Vuille et al. (2008a) found
that climate in the tropical Andes has changed significantly over the
past 50 to 60 years. Temperature in the Andes has increased by
approximately 0.1°C per decade, with only 2 of the last 20 years being
below the 1961-1990 average. Precipitation has slightly increased in
the second half of the 20th century in the inner tropics and decreased
in the outer tropics. The general pattern of moistening in the inner
tropics and drying in the subtropical Andes is dynamically consistent
with observed changes in the large-scale circulation, suggesting a
strengthening of the tropical atmospheric circulation. Moreover, a
positive significant trend in mean temperature of 0.09°C per decade
during 1965-2007 has been detected over the Peruvian Andes by
Lavado et al. (2012).

"The increased climatic variability in the past decade certainly changed the perception of people in the region with respect to climate
change. In a survey to small farmers in 2003, Tucker et al. (2010) found that only 25% of respondents included climate events as a
major concern. A subsequent survey in 2007 (Eakin et al., 2013) found that more than 50% of respondents cited drought conditions
and torrential rains as their greatest concern. Interestingly, there was no consensus on the direction in climate change pattern: The
majority of households in Honduras reported an increase in the frequency of droughts but in Costa Rica and Guatemala a decrease or
no trend at all was reported. A similar discrepancy in answers was reported with the issue of increased rainfall. But there was general
agreement in all countries that rainfall patterns were more variable, resulting in higher difficulty in recognizing the start of the rainy
season.

"The high levels of risk to disasters in CA are the result of high exposure to hazards and the high vulnerability of the population and
its livelihoods derived from elevated levels of poverty and social exclusion (Programa Estado de la Nacion-Regién, 2011). Disaster
management in the region has focused on improving early warning systems and emergency response for specific extreme events
(Saldafia-Zorrilla, 2008) but little attention has been paid to strengthening existing social capital in the form of local organizations
and cooperatives. These associations can be central in increasing adaptive capacity through increased access to financial instruments
and strategic information on global markets and climate (Eakin et al., 2011). There is a need to increase the communication of the
knowledge from local communities involved in processes of autonomous adaptation to policymakers responsible for strengthening
the adaptive capacities in CA (Castellanos et al., 2013).

"Central America (CA) has traditionally been characterized as a region with high exposure to geo-climatic hazards derived from its
location and topography and with high vulnerability of its human settlements (ECLAC, 2010c). It has also been identified as the most
responsive tropical region to climate change (Giorgi, 2006). Evidence for this has been accumulating particularly in the last 30 years,
with a steady increase in extreme events including storms, floods, and droughts. In the period 2000-2009, 39 hurricanes occurred in
the Caribbean basin compared to 15 and 9 in the 1980s and 1990s, respectively (UNEP and ECLAC, 2010). The impacts of these events
on the population and the economy of the region have been tremendous: the economic loss derived from 11 recent hydrometereological
events evaluated amounted to US$13.64 billion and the number of people impacted peaked with Hurricane Mitch in 1998, with more
than 600,000 persons affected (ECLAC, 2010c). A high percentage of the population in CA live on or near highly unstable steep terrain
with sandy, volcanic soils prone to mudslides, which are the main cause of casualties and destruction (Restrepo and Alvarez, 2006).

"The area of forest loss in CA is considerably less than in SA, owing to
smaller country sizes (Carr et al., 2009), but when relative deforestation
rates are considered, Honduras and Nicaragua show the highest values
for CA and SA (FAO, 2010). At the same time, CA includes some countries
where forest cover shows a small recovery trend in the last years: Costa
Rica, El Salvador, Panama, and possibly Honduras, where data are
conflicting in the literature (FAO, 2010; Aide et al., 2013). This forest
transition is the result of (1) economies less dependent on agriculture,
and more on industry and services (Wright and Samaniego, 2008); (2)
processes of international migration with the associated remittances
(Hecht and Saatchi, 2007); and (3) a stronger emphasis on the recognition
of environmental services of forest ecosystems (Kaimowitz, 2008). The
same positive trend is observed in some SA countries (Figure 27-3).
However, a substantial amount of forest is gained through (single-crop)
plantations, most noticeably in Chile (Aguayo et al., 2009), which has a
much lower ecological value than the depleted natural forests (Echeverria
et al., 2006; Izquierdo et al., 2008).
"	Text
"Deforestation rates for the region remain high in spite of a reducing
trend in the last decade (Ramankutty et al., 2007; Fearnside, 2008).
Brazil is by far the country with the highest area of forest loss in the
world according to the latest Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
statistics (2010): 21,940 km? yr“, equivalent to 39% of world deforestation
for the period 2005-2010. Bolivia, Venezuela, and Argentina follow in
deforested area (Figure 27-3), with 5.5, 5.2, and 4.3% of the total world
deforestation, respectively. The countries of CA and SA lost a total of
38,300 km? of forest per year in that period (69% of the total world
deforestation; FAO, 2010). These numbers are limited by the fact that
many countries do not have comparable information through time,
particularly for recent years. Aide et al. (2013) completed a wall-to-wall
analysis for the region for the period 2001-2010, analyzing not only
deforestation but also reforestation, and reported very different results
than FAO (2010) for some countries where reforestation seems to be
higher than deforestation, particularly in Honduras, El Salvador, Panama,
Colombia, and Venezuela. For Colombia and Venezuela, these results
are contradictory with country analyses that align better with the FAO
data (Rodriguez, J.P. et al., 2010; Armenteras et al., 2013).

"In recent years, soybean croplands have expanded continuously in SA,
becoming increasingly more important in the agricultural production of
the region. Soybean-planted area in Amazonian states (mainly Mato
Grosso) in Brazil expanded 12.1% per year during the 1990s, and 16.8%
per year from 2000 to 2005 (Costa et al., 2007). This landscape-scale
conversion from forest to soy and other large-scale agriculture can alter
substantially the water balance for large areas of the region, resulting
in important feedbacks to the local climate (Hayhoe et al., 2011; Loarie
et al., 2011; see Section 27.3.4.1).
"	Text
"However, forests are not the only important ecosystems threatened in
the region. An assessment of threatened ecosystems in SA by Jarvis et
al. (2010) concluded that grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands are
more threatened than forests, mainly from excessively frequent fires
(>1 yr) and grazing pressure. An estimation of burned land in LA by
Chuvieco et al. (2008) also concluded that herbaceous areas presented
the highest occurrence of fires. In the Rio de la Plata region (central-
east Argentina, southern Brazil, and Uruguay), grasslands decreased from
67.4 to 61.4% between 1985 and 2004. This reduction was associated
with an increase in annual crops, mainly soybean, sunflower, wheat,
and maize (Baldi and Paruelo, 2008).
"	Text
"Palm oil is a significant biofuel crop also linked to recent deforestation
in tropical CA and SA. Its magnitude is still small compared with
deforestation related to soybean and cattle ranching, but is considerable
for specific countries and expected to increase due to increasing demands
for biofuels (Fitzherbert et al., 2008). The main producers of palm oil in
the region are Colombia and Ecuador, followed by Costa Rica, Honduras,
Guatemala, and Brazil; Brazil has the largest potential for expansion,
as nearly half of the Amazonia is suitable for oil palm cultivation (Butler
and Laurance, 2009). Palm oil production is also growing in the
Amazonian region of Peru, where 72% of new plantations have expanded
into forested areas, representing 1.3% of the total deforestation for that
country for the years 2000-2010 (Gutiérrez-Vélez et al., 2011).
"	Text
"dominated the agricultural expansion: soy production (only in SA) and
beef. But, more recently, biomass for biofuel production has become as
important (Nepstad and Stickler, 2008) with some regions also affected
by oil and mining extractions. Deforestation by small farmers, coming
mainly from families who migrate in search for land, is relatively low:
extensive cattle production is the predominant land use in deforested
areas of tropical and subtropical Latin America (Wassenaar et al., 2007).
Cattle is the only land use variable correlated with deforestation in
Colombia (Armenteras et al., 2013), and in the Brazilian Amazon the
peak of deforestation in 2004 (Figure 27-4) was primarily the result of
increased cattle ranching (Nepstad et al., 2006). Mechanized farming,
agro-industrial production, and cattle ranching are the major land
use change drivers in eastern Bolivia but subsistence agriculture by
indigenous colonists is also important (Killeen et al., 2008).
"	Text
"Development in the region has traditionally displayed four characteristics:
low growth rates, high volatility, structural heterogeneity, and very unequal
income distribution (ECLAC, 2008; Barcena, 2010). This combination of
factors has generated high and persistent poverty levels (45% for CA and
30% for SA for year 2010), with the rate of poverty being generally higher
in rural than urban areas (ECLAC, 2009b). SA has based its economic
growth in natural resource exploitation (mining, energy, agricultural),
which involves direct and intensive use of land and water, and in energy-
intensive and, in many cases, highly polluting natural resource-based
manufactures. In turn, CA has exploited its proximity to the North
American market and its relatively low labor costs (ECLAC, 2010e). The
region shows a marked structural heterogeneity, where modern
production structures coexist with large segments of the population with
low productivity and income levels (ECLAC, 2010g). The gross domestic
product (GDP) per capita in SA is twice that of CA; in addition, in the
latter, poverty is 50% higher (see Figure 27-5).
"	Text
"Soybean and beef production have also impacted other ecosystems
next to the Amazon, such as the Cerrado (Brazil) and the Chaco dry
forests (Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil). Gasparri et al. (2008)
estimated carbon emissions from deforestation in northern Argentina,
and concluded that deforestation in the Chaco forest has accelerated
in the past decade from agricultural expansion and is now the most
important source of carbon emissions for that region. In northwest
Argentina (Tucuman and Salta provinces), 14,000 km? of dry forest were
cleared from 1972 to 2007 as a result of technological improvements and
increasing rainfall (Gasparri and Grau, 2009). Deforestation continued
during the 1980s and 1990s, resulting in cropland area covering up to
63% of the region by 2005 (Viglizzo et al., 2011). In central Argentina
(northern Cordoba province), cultivated lands have increased from 3 to
30% (between 1969 and 1999); and the forest cover has decreased from
52.5 to 8.2%. This change has also been attributed to the synergistic
effect of climatic, socioeconomic, and technological factors (Zak et al.,
2008). Losses in the Atlantic forest are estimated in 29% of the original
area in 1960, and in 28% of the Yunga forest area, mainly due to cattle
ranching migration from the Pampas and Espinal (Viglizzo et al., 2011).
"	Text
"Even with technological changes that might result in agricultural
intensification, the expansion of pastures and croplands is expected to
continue in the coming years (Wassenaar et al., 2007; Kaimowitz and
Angelsen, 2008), particularly from an increasing global demand for food
and biofuels (Gregg and Smith, 2010) with the consequent increase in
commodity prices. This agricultural expansion will be mainly in LA and
sub-Saharan Africa as these regions hold two-thirds of the global land
with potential to expand cultivation (Nepstad and Stickler, 2008). It is
important to consider the policy and legal needs to keep this process of
large-scale change under control as much as possible; Takasaki (2007)
showed that policies to eliminate land price distortions and promote
technological transfers to poor colonists could reduce deforestation. It
is also important to consider the role of indigenous groups; there is a
growing acknowledgment that recognizing the land ownership and
authority of indigenous groups can help central governments to better
manage many of the natural areas remaining in the region (Oltremari
and Jackson, 2006; Larson, 2010). The impact of indigenous groups on
land use change can vary: de Oliveira et al. (2007) found that only 9%
of the deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon between 1999 and 2005
happened in indigenous territories, but Killeen et al. (2008) found that
Andean indigenous colonists in Bolivia were responsible for the largest
land cover changes in the period 2001-2004. Indigenous groups are
important stakeholders in many territories in the region and their well-
being should be considered when designing responses to pressures on
the land by a globalized economy (Gray et al., 2008; Killeen et al., 2008).

the Caribbean), of which 86% had access to water supply by 2006
(ECLAC, 2010b). According to the International Energy Agency (IEA),
the region meets 60% of its electricity demand through hydropower
generation, which contrasts with the 20% average contribution of other
regions (see Table 27-6 and case study in Section 27.6.1).

"In the second half of 2009, industrial production and exports began to
recover and yielded a stronger economic performance (GDP growth of
6.4% in SA and 3.9% in CA in 2010; ECLAC, 2012b). SA benefited the
most because of the larger size of their domestic markets and the
greater diversification of export markets. Conversely, slower growth was
observed in CA, with more open economies and a less diversified
portfolio of trading partners and a greater emphasis on manufacturing
trade (ECLAC, 2010g).
"	Text
"The region is expected to continue to grow in the short term, albeit at
a pace that is closer to potential GDP growth, helped by internal
demand as the middle class becomes stronger and as credit becomes
more available. In SA, this could be boosted by external demand from
the Asian economies as they continue to grow at a rapid pace. The
macroeconomic challenge is to act counter cyclically, creating conditions
for productive development that is not based solely on commodity
exports (ECLAC, 2010f).
"	Text
"The 2008 financial crisis reached CA and SA through exports and credits,
remittances, and worsening expectations by consumers and producers
(Barcena, 2010; Kacef and Lopez-Monti, 2010). This resulted in the
sudden stop of six consecutive years of robust growth and improving
social indicators (ECLAC, 2010e), which contributed to higher poverty
in 2009 after 6 years where poverty had declined by 11%. Poverty rates
fell from 44 to 33% of the total population from 2003 to 2008 (Figure
27-5), leaving 150 million people in this situation while extreme poverty
diminished from 19.4 to 12.9% (which represents slightly more than 70
million people) (ECLAC, 2009b).

"The region faces significant challenges in terms of environmental
sustainability and adaptability to a changing climate (ECLAC, 2010h),
resulting from the specific characteristics of its population and economy
already discussed and aggravated with a significant deficit in infrastructure
development. CA and SA countries have made progress in incorporating
environmental protection into decision-making processes, particularly
in terms of environmental institutions and legislation, but there are still
difficulties to effectively incorporate environmental issues into relevant
public policies (ECLAC, 2010h). Although climate change imposes new
challenges, it also provides an opportunity to shift development and
economic growth patterns toward a more environmentally friendly course.

"0.5 and 0.6, whereas the equivalent figures in a group of 24 developed
countries vary between under 0.25 and around 0.4. The average per
capita income of the richest 10% of households is approximately 17 times
that of the poorest 40% of households (ECLAC, 2010g). Nevertheless,
during the first decade of the century, prior to the financial crisis, the
region has shown a slight but clear trend toward a more equitable
distribution of income and a stronger middle class population, resulting
in a higher demand for goods (ECLAC, 2010g,h, 2011b). Latin American
countries also reported gains in terms of human development, although
these gains have slowed down slightly over recent years. In comparative
terms, as measured by the Human Development Index (HDI), the
performance of countries varied greatly in 2007 (from Chile with 0.878
and Argentina with 0.866 to Guatemala with 0.704 and Nicaragua with
0.699), although those with lower levels of HDI showed notably higher
improvements than countries with the highest HDI (UNDP, 2010).

"on robust evidence, high agreement). Rabatel et al. (2013) provides a
synthesis of these studies (specific papers are presented in Table 27-3a).
Tropical glaciers’ retreat has accelerated in the second half of the 20th
century (area loss between 20 and 50%), especially since the late 1970s
in association with increasing temperature in the same period (Bradley
et al., 2009). In early stages of glacier retreat, associated streamflow
tends to increase due to an acceleration of glacier melt, but after a peak
in streamflow as the glacierized water reservoir gradually empties,
runoff tends to decrease, as evidenced in the Cordillera Blanca of Peru
(Chevallier et al., 2011; Baraer et al., 2012), where seven out of nine
river basins have probably crossed a critical threshold, exhibiting a
decreasing dry-season discharge (Baraer et al., 2012). Likewise, glaciers
and ice fields in the extratropical Andes located in central-south Chile
and Argentina face significant reductions (see review in Masiokas et al.
(2009) and details in Table 27-3b), with their effect being compounded
by changes in snowpack extent, thus magnifying changes in hydrograph
seasonality by reducing flows in dry seasons and increasing them in

Brazil (Hastenrath, 2012). de Mello et al. (2008), Gondim et al. (2008),
Souza et al. (2010), and Montenegro and Ragab (2010) have shown
that future climate change scenarios would decrease water availability
for agriculture irrigation owing to reductions in precipitation and increases
in evapotranspiration (medium confidence). Krol and Bronstert (2007)

of the largest basins in CA, covering portions of Guatemala, Honduras,
and El Salvador. They showed that future climate projections (increase
in evaporation and reduction in precipitation) imply a reduction of 20%
in inflows to major reservoirs in this system (see Table 27-4). Imbach et
al. (2012) found similar results using a modeling approach that also
considered potential changes in vegetation. These effects could have
large hydropower generation implications as discussed in the case study

"(La Plata Basin) and Amazon Rivers. Nevertheless, in both cases the
average change showed a positive value consistent, at least with
observations for the La Plata Basin. In a more recent work Nakaegawa
et al. (2013a) showed a statistically significant increase for both basins
in a study that replicated that of Nohara et al. (2006) but with a different
hydrologic model. Focusing in extreme flows Guimberteau et al. (2013)
show that by the middle of the century no change is found in high flow
on the main stem of the Amazon River but there is a systematic reduction
in low-flow streamflow. In contrast, the northwestern part of the
Amazon River shows a consistent increase in high flow and inundated
area (Guimberteau et al., 2013; Langerwisch et al., 2013). On top of
such climatic uncertainty, future streamflows and water availability
projections are confounded by the potential effects of land use changes
(Moore et al., 2007; Coe et al., 2009; Georgescu et al., 2013).

"Similar conclusions are derived across the Andes on the Limay River in
Argentina by Seoane and Lépez (2007). Under these conditions, semi-
arid highly populated basins (e.g., Santiago, Chile) and with extensive
agriculture irrigation and hydropower demands are expected to increase
their current vulnerability (high confidence; ECLAC, 2009a; Souvignet
et al., 2010; Fiebig-Wittmaack et al., 2012; Vicufia et al, 2012; see Table
27-4). Projected changes in the cryosphere conditions of the Andes
could affect the occurrence of extreme events, such as extreme low and
high flows (Demaria et al., 2013), Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOF)
occurring in the ice fields of Patagonia (Dussaillant et al., 2010; Marin et
al., 2013), volcanic collapse and debris flow associated with accelerated
glacial melting in the tropical Andes (Carey, 2005; Carey et al., 2012b;
Fraser, 2012), and with volcanoes in southern Chile and Argentina
(Tormey, 2010), as well as scenarios of water quality pollution by exposure
to contaminants as a result of glaciers’ retreat (Fortner et al., 2011).

"At an institutional level, a series of policies have been developed to reduce
vulnerability to climate variability as faced today in different regions
and settings. In 1997, Brazil instituted the National Water Resources
Policy and created the National Water Resources Management System
under the shared responsibility between the states and the federal
government. Key to this new regulation has been the promotion of
decentralization and social participation through the creation of National
Council of Water Resources and their counterparts in the states, the
States Water Resources Councils. The challenges and opportunities
dealing with water resources management in Brazil in the face of climate
variability and climate change have been well studied (Abers, 2007;
Kumler and Lemos, 2008; Medema et al., 2008; Engle et al., 2011; Lorz et
al., 2012). Other countries in the region are following similar approaches.
In the last years, there have been constitutional and legal reforms
toward more efficient and effective water resources management and
coordination among relevant actors in Honduras, Nicaragua, Ecuador,
Peru, Uruguay, Bolivia, and Mexico; although in many cases, these
innovations have not been completely implemented (Hantke-Domas,
2011). Institutional and governance improvements are required to
ensure an effective implementation of these adaptation measures (e.g.,
Halsnaes and Verhagen, 2007; Engle and Lemos, 2010; Lemos et al.,
2010; Zagonari, 2010; Pittock, 2011; Kirchhoff et al. 2013).

"The evolution of tropical Andes glaciers associated future climate
scenarios has been studied using trend (e.g., Poveda and Pineda, 2009),
regression (e.g., Juen et al., 2007; Chevallier et al, 2011), and explicit
modeling (e.g., Condom et al., 2012) analysis. These studies indicate that
glaciers will continue their retreat (Vuille et al., 2008a) and even disappear
as glacier equilibrium line altitude rises, with larger hydrological effects
during the dry season (Kaser et al., 2010; Gascoin et al., 2011). This is
expected to happen during the next 20 to 50 years (Juen et al., 2007;
Chevallier et al., 2011; see Table 27-4). After that period water availability
during the dry months is expected to diminish. A projection by Baraer
et al. (2012) for the Santa River in the Peruvian Andes finds that once
the glaciers are completely melt, annual discharge would decrease by
2 to 30%, depending on the watershed. Glacier retreat can exacerbate
current water resources-related vulnerability (Bradley et al., 2006; Casassa
et al., 2007; Vuille et al, 2008b; Mulligan et al., 2010), diminishing the
mountains’ water regulation capacity, making the supply of water for
diverse purposes, as well as for ecosystems integrity, more expensive
and less reliable (Buytaert et al., 2011). Impacts on economic activities
associated with conceptual scenarios of glacier melt reduction have been
monetized (Vergara et al., 2007), representing about US$100 million in
the case of water supply for Quito, and between US$212 million and
US$1.5 billion in the case of the Peruvian electricity sector due to losses
of hydropower generation (see the case study in Section 27.6.1). Andean
communities will face an important increase in their vulnerability, as
documented by Mark et al. (2010), Pérez et al. (2010), and Buytaert and
De Biévre (2012).

Glacier retreat could also impact activities in high mountainous ecosystems such as alpine tourism, mountaineering,

"The retreat of glaciers in the tropical Andes mountains, with some fluctuations, started after the Little Ice Age
(16th to 19th centuries), but the rate of retreat (area reduction between 20 and 50%) has accelerated since the
late 1970s. The changes in runoff from glacial retreat into the basins fed by such runoff vary depending on the size
and phase of glacier retreat. In an early phase, runoff tends to increase as a result of accelerated melting, but after
a peak, as the glacierized water reservoir gradually empties, runoff tends to decrease. This reduction in runoff is
more evident during dry months, when glacier melt is the major contribution to runoff (high confidence).

"CA and SA house the largest biological diversity and several of the
world’s megadiverse countries (Mittermeier et al., 1997; Guevara and
Laborde, 2008). However, land use change has led to the existence of
six biodiversity hotspots, that is, places with a great species diversity
that show high habitat loss and also high levels of species endemism:
Mesoamerica, Chocé-Darien-Western Ecuador, Tropical Andes, Central
Chile, Brazilian Atlantic forest, and Brazilian Cerrado (Mittermeier et al.,
2005). Thus, conversion of natural ecosystems is the main proximate cause
of biodiversity and ecosystem loss in the region (Ayoo, 2008). Tropical
deforestation is the second largest driver of anthropogenic climate
change on the planet, adding up to 17 to 20% of total greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions during the 1990s (Gullison et al, 2007; Strassburg et al.,
2010). In parallel, the region still has large extensions of wilderness areas
for which the Amazon is the most outstanding example. Nevertheless,
some of these areas are precisely the new frontier of economic expansion.
For instance, between 1996 and 2005, Brazil deforested about 19,500
km? yr, which represented 2 to 5% of global annual carbon dioxide (CO,)

"assessment of adaptation strategies for tropical Andean communities
such as the role of governance and institutions (Young and Lipton, 2006;
Lynch, 2012), technology (Carey et al., 2012a), and the dynamics of
multiple stressors (McDowell and Hess, 2012; Bury et al., 2013). Semi-
arid regions are characterized by pronounced climatic variability and
often by water scarcity and related social stress (Krol and Bronstert,
2007; Scott et al., 2012, 2013). Adaptation tools to face the threats of
climate change for the most vulnerable communities in the Chilean
semi-arid region are discussed by Young et al. (2010) and Debels et al.
(2009). In CA, Benegas et al. (2009), Manuel-Navarrete et al. (2007),
and Aguilar et al. (2009) provide different frameworks to understand
vulnerability and adaptation strategies to climate change and variability
in urban and rural contexts, although no specific adaptation strategies
are suggested. The particular experience in NEB provides other examples
of adaptation strategies to manage actual climate variability. Broad et
al. (2007) and Sankarasubramanian et al. (2009) studied the potential
benefits of streamflow forecast as a way to reduce the impacts of
climate change and climate variability on water distribution under stress
conditions. An historical review and analysis of drought management
in this region are provided by Campos and Carvalho (2008). de Souza
Filho and Brown (2009) studied different water distribution policy
scenarios, finding that the best option depended on the degree of
water scarcity. The study by Nelson and Finan (2009) provides a critical
perspective of drought-related policies, arguing that they constitute an
example of maladaptation as they do not try to solve the causes of
vulnerability and instead undermine resilience. Tompkins et al. (2008)
are also critical of risk reduction practices in this region because they
have fallen short of addressing the fundamental causes of vulnerability
needed for efficient longer term drought management. Other types of
adaptation options that stem from studies on arid and semi-arid regions
are related to (1) increase in water supply from groundwater pumping
(Doll, 2009; Kundzewicz and Déll, 2009; Zagonari, 2010; Burte et al.,
2011; Nadal et al., 2013), fog interception practices (Holder, 2006;
Klemm et al., 2012), and reservoirs and irrigation infrastructure (Fry et

2000; Salazar et al., 2007; Sampaio et al., 2007; Lenton et al., 2008;
Nobre and Borma, 2009). Various models are projecting a risk of reduced
rainfall and higher temperatures and water stress, which may lead to
an abrupt and irreversible replacement of Amazon forests by savanna-
like vegetation, under a high emission scenario (A2), from 2050-2060
to 2100 (Betts et al., 2004, 2008; Cox et al., 2004; Salazar et al., 2007;

or “die-back” of the Amazon region would potentially have large-scale
impacts on climate, biodiversity, and people in the region. The possibility
of this die-back scenario occurring, however, is still an open issue and
the uncertainties are still very high (Rammig et al., 2010; Shiogama et

"In addition to climate change impacts at the individual species level,
biotic interactions will be affected. Modifications in phenology, structure
of ecological networks, predator-prey interactions, and non-trophic
interactions among organisms have been forecasted (Brooker et al.,
2008; Walther, 2010). The outcome of non-trophic interactions among
plants is expected to shift along with variation in climatic parameters,
with more facilitative interactions in more stressful environments, and
more competitive interactions in more benign environments (Brooker

strong influence of community and ecosystem (re-)organization given the
key engineering role played by plants on the functioning of ecosystems
(Callaway, 2007). High Andean ecosystems, especially those within the
tropics, are expected to face exceptionally strong warming effects during
the 21st century because of their uncommonly high altitude (Bradley

services for millions of people (Buytaert et al., 2011). For these reasons
shifts in biotic interactions are expected to have negative consequences

than 30% of the population lives in coastal areas directly exposed to
climatic events. Large coastal populations are related to the significant
transformation marine ecosystems have been undergoing in the region.
Fish stocks, places for recreation and tourism, and controls of pests and
pathogens are all under pressure (Guarderas et al., 2008; Mora, 2008).
Moreover, SLR varied from 2 to 7 mm yr! between 1950 and 2008 in

of variation under El Nifio events of the same order of magnitude

"The effective management of natural protected areas and the creation
of new protected areas within national protected area systems and
community management of natural areas are also efficient tools to
adapt to climate change and to reconcile biodiversity conservation with
socioeconomic development (e.g., Bolivian Andes: Hoffmann et al., 2011;
Panama: Oestreicher et al., 2009). Porter-Bolland et al. (2012) compared
protected areas with areas under community management in different
parts of the tropical world, including CA and SA, and found that protected
areas have higher deforestation rates than areas with community
management. Similarly, Nelson and Chomitz (2011) found for the region
that (1) protected areas of restricted use reduced fire substantially, but
multi-use protected areas are even more effective; and (2) in indigenous

the figure shows how potential impacts may be distributed in the region (ECLAC, 201 1a). Flooding: Since flooding probability increases with increasing sea level, one may
expect a higher probability of flooding in locations showing >40% of change over the last 60 years in 100-year total sea level (excluding hurricanes). The figure also identifies
urban areas where the highest increase in flooding level has been obtained. Beach erosion: \ncreases with potential sediment transport, and thus locations where changes in
potential sediment transport have increased over a certain threshold have a higher probability of being eroded. Sea ports and reliability of coastal structures: Shows
locations where, in the case of having a protection structure in place, there is a reduction in the reliability of the structures due to the increase in the design wave height
estimates. (b) Coastal dynamics: Information based on historical time series that have been obtained by a combination of data reanalysis, available instrumental information, and
satellite information. Advanced statistical techniques have been used for obtaining trends including uncertainties (Izaguirre et al, 2013; Losada et al., 2013).

"The majority of the literature concerning climate change impacts for
coastal and marine ecosystems considers coral reefs (see also Chapter 5;
Box CC-CR), mangroves, and fisheries. Coral reefs are particularly
sensitive to climate-induced changes in the physical environment (Baker
et al., 2008) to an extent that one-third of the more than 700 species
of reef-building corals worldwide are already threatened with extinction
(Carpenter et al., 2008). Coral bleaching and mortality are often associated
with ocean warming and acidification (Baker et al., 2008). If extreme
sea surface temperatures were to continue, the projections using SRES
scenarios (A1FI, 3°C sensitivity, and A1B with 2°C and 4.5°C sensitivity)
indicate that it is possible that the Mesoamerican coral reef will collapse
by mid-century (between 2050 and 2070), causing major economic
losses (Vergara, 2009). Extreme high sea surface temperatures have

and again in 2010) of the Mesoamerican coral reef, located along the
coasts of Belize, Honduras, and Guatemala (Eakin et al., 2010). Reef and
also mangrove ecosystems are estimated to contribute greatly to goods
and services in economic terms. In Belize, for example, this amount is
approximately US$395 to US$559 million annually, primarily through
marine-based tourism, fisheries, and coastal protection (Cooper et al.,
2008). In the Eastern Tropical Pacific, seascape trace abundance of
cement and elevated nutrients in upwelled waters are factors that help
explain high bioerosion rates of local coral reefs (Manzello et al., 2008).
In the southwestern Atlantic coast, eastern Brazilian reefs might suffer
a massive coral cover decline in the next 50 years (Francini-Filho et al.,
2008). This estimate is based on coral disease prevalence and progression
rate, along with growth rate of Mussismilia braziliensis—a major reef-
building coral species that is endemic in Brazil. These authors also
pointed out that coral diseases intensified between 2005 and 2007 based
on qualitative observations since the 1980s and regular monitoring since
2001. They have also predicted that the studied coral species will be
nearly extinct in less than a century if the current rate of mortality due
to disease is not reversed.

1.5% of the coastal and shelf waters, most of which allow varying levels
of extractive activities (Guarderas et al., 2008). This protected area cover,
however, is insufficient to preserve important habitats or connectivity
among populations at large biogeographic scales (Guarderas et al., 2008).

"Nevertheless, examples of adaptation in CA and SA are predominantly
related to MPAs. In Brazil, a protected area type known as “Marine
Extractive Reserves” currently benefits 60,000 small-scale fishermen along
the coast (de Moura et al., 2009). Examples of fisheries’ co-management,
a form of a participatory process involving local fishermen communities,
government, academia, and non-governmental organizations, are reported
to favor a balance between conservation of marine fisheries, coral reefs,
and mangroves on the one hand (Francini-Filho and de Moura, 2008),
and the improvement of livelihoods, as well as the cultural survival of
traditional populations on the other (de Moura et al., 2009; Hastings,

"Peru and Colombia are two of the eight most vulnerable countries to
climate change impacts on fisheries, owing to the combined effect of
observed and projected warming, to species and productivity shifts in
upwelling systems, to the relative importance of fisheries to national
economies and diets, and limited societal capacity to adapt to potential
impacts and opportunities (Allison et al., 2009). Fisheries production
systems are already pressured by overfishing, habitat loss, pollution,
invasive species, water abstraction, and damming (Allison et al., 2009).
In Brazil, a decadal rate of 0.16 trophic level decline (as measured by
the Marine Trophic Index, which refers to the mean trophic level of the
catch) has been detected through most of the northeastern coast,
between 1978 and 2000, which is one of the highest rates documented
in the world (Freire and Pauly, 2010).

estimates are that climate change may lead to a maximum global loss
of 10 to 15% of mangrove forest by 2100 (Alongi, 2008). In CA and SA,
some of the main drivers of loss are deforestation and land conversion,
agriculture, and shrimp ponds (Polidoro et al., 2010). The Atlantic and
Pacific coasts of CA are some of the most endangered on the planet
with regard to mangroves, as approximately 40% of present species
are threatened with extinction (Polidoro et al., 2010). Approximately
75% of the global mangrove extension is concentrated in 15 countries,
among which Brazil is included (Giri et al, 2011). The rate of survival of
original mangroves lies between 12.8 and 47.6% in the Tumaco Bay
(Colombia), resulting in ecosystem collapse, fisheries reduction, and
impacts on livelihoods (Lampis, 2010). Gratiot et al. (2008) project for the
current decade an increase of mean high water levels of 6 cm followed
by 90 m shoreline retreat, implying flooding of thousands of hectares
of mangrove forest along the coast of French Guiana.

"Ecosystems provide a wide range of basic services, such as providing breathable air, drinkable water, and moderating
flood risk (very high confidence). Assigning values to these services and designing conservation agreements based
on these (broadly known as payment for ecosystem services, or PES) can be an effective way to help local communities
adapt to climate change. It can simultaneously help protect natural areas and improve livelihoods and human well-
being (medium confidence). However, during design and planning, a number of factors need to be taken into
consideration at the local level to avoid potentially negative results. Problems can arise if (1) the plan sets poor
definitions about whether the program should focus just on actions to be taken or the end result of those actions,
(2) many perceive the initiative as commoditization of nature and its intangible values, (3) the action is inefficient
to reduce poverty, (4) difficulties emerge in building trust between various stakeholders involved in agreements,

contributed to the expansion of agricultural areas (Barros, 2008a; Hoyos

to 1930-1960) led to increases in maize and soybean yields (9 to 58%)
in Argentina, Uruguay, and southern Brazil (Magrin et al., 2007b). Even
if rainfall projections estimate increases of about 25% in SESA for 2100,
agricultural systems could be threatened if climate reverts to a drier
situation due to inter-decadal variability. This could put at risk the viability
of continuous agriculture in marginal regions of Argentina's Pampas
(Podesta et al., 2009). During the 1930s and 1940s, dry and windy

"On the other hand, the implementation of adaptation strategies to SLR
or to address coastal erosion is more commonly seen in many countries
in the region (Lacambra and Zahedi, 2011). For instance, redirecting new
settlements to better-protected locations and to promote investments
in appropriate infrastructure shall be required in the low elevation
coastal zones (LECZ) of the region, particularly in lower income countries
with limited resources, which are especially vulnerable. The same applies
to countries with high shares of land (e.g., Brazil ranking 7th worldwide
of the total land area in the LECZ) and/or population (e.g., Guyana and
Suriname ranking 2nd and 5th by the share of population in the LECZ,
having respectively 76 and 55% of their populations in such areas)
(McGranahan et al., 2007). Adaptation will demand effective and
enforceable regulations and economic incentives, all of which require
political will as well as financial and human capital (McGranahan et al.,
2007). Adaptive practices addressing river flooding are also being
made available as in the study of Casco et al. (2011) for the low Parana

"At the global scale (see Chapter 7), warming since 1981 has reduced
wheat, maize, and barley productivity, although the impacts were small
compared with the technological yield gains over the same period
(Lobell and Field, 2007). In central Argentina, simulated potential wheat
yield—without considering technological improvements—has been
decreasing at increasing rates since 1930 (1930-2000: -28 kg ha"" yr"";
1970-2000: -53 kg ha""! yr"") in response to increases in minimum
temperature during October-November (1930-2000: +0.4°C per decade;
1970-2000: +0.6°C per decade) (Magrin et al., 2009). The observed
changes in the growing season temperature and precipitation between
1980 and 2008 have slowed the positive yield trends due to improved
genetics in Brazilian wheat, maize, and soy, as well as Paraguayan soy.
In contrast, rice in Brazil and soybean in Argentina have benefited from
precipitation and temperature trends (Lobell et al., 2011). In Argentina,
increases in soybean yield may be associated with weather types that
favor the entry of cold air from the south, reducing thermal stress during
flowering and pod set, and weather types that increase the probability
of dry days at harvest (Bettolli et al., 2009).

"Climate change impact on regional welfare will depend not only on
changes in yield, but also in international trade. According to Hertel et
al. (2010), by 2030, global cereal price could change between increases
of 32% (low-productivity scenario) or decreases of 16% (optimistic yield
scenario). A rise in prices could benefit net exporting countries such as
Brazil, where gains from terms of trade shifts could outweigh the losses
due to climate change. Despite experiencing significant negative yield
shocks, some countries tend to gain from higher commodity prices.
However, most poor household are food purchasers and rising commodity
prices tend to have a negative effect on poverty (von Braun, 2007).
According to Chapter 7, increases in prices during 2007-2009 led to
rising poverty in Nicaragua.

"Genetic advances and suitable soil and technological management
may induce an increase in some crops’ yield despite unfavorable future
climate conditions. In Argentina, genetic techniques, specific scientific
knowledge, and land use planning are viewed as promising sources of
adaptation (Urcola et al., 2010). Adjustments in sowing dates and
fertilization rates could reduce negative impacts or increase yields in
maize and wheat crops in Argentina and Chile (Magrin et al., 2009;
Meza and da Silva, 2009; Travasso et al., 2009b). Furthermore, in central
Chile and southern Pampas in Argentina warmer climates could allow
performing two crops per season, increasing productivity per unit land
(Monzon et al., 2007; Meza et al., 2008). In Brazil, adaptation strategies
for coffee crops include planting at high densities, vegetated soil, accurate
irrigation and breeding programs, and shading management system
(arborization) (Camargo, 2010). Shading is also used in Costa Rica and
Colombia. In south Brazil, a good option for irrigated rice could be to
plant early cultivars (Walter et al, 2010).

"In CA, changes projected in climate could severely affect the poorest
population and especially their food security, increasing the current rate
of chronic malnutrition. Currently, Guatemala is the most food insecure
country by percentage of the population (30.4%) and the problem has
been increasing in recent years (FAO, WFP, and IFAD, 2012). The impact
of climate variability and change is a great challenge in the region. As
an example, the recent rust problem on the coffee sector of 2012-2013
has affected nearly 600,000 ha (55% of the total area) (ICO, 2013) and
will reduce employment by 30 to 40% for the harvest 2013-2014
(FEWS NET, 2013). At least 1.4 million people in Guatemala, El Salvador,
Honduras, and Nicaragua depend on the coffee sector, which is very
susceptible to climate variations. In Panama, the large interannual climate
variability will continue to be the dominant influence on seasonal maize
yield into the coming decades (Ruane et al., 2013). In the future, warming
conditions combined with more variable rainfall are expected to reduce
maize, bean, and rice productivity (ECLAC, 2010c); rice and wheat
yields could decrease up to 10% by 2030 (Lobell et al., 2008; medium
confidence). In CA, nearly 90% of agricultural production destined for
internal consumption is composed by maize (70%), bean (25%), and
rice (6%) (ECLAC, 20114).

"corn, and cassava are projected (Lobell et al., 2008; Margulis et al.,
2010). In addition, increases in temperature could reduce the areas
currently favorable to cowpea bean (Silva et al., 2010). The highest
warming foreseen for 2100 (5.8°C, under SRES A2 scenario) could make
the coffee crop unfeasible in Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo (southeast
Brazil) if no adaptation action is accomplished. Thus, the coffee crop
may have to be transferred to southern regions where temperatures are
lower and the frost risk will be reduced (Camargo, 2010). With +3°C,
Arabica coffee is expected to expand in the extreme south of Brazil,
the Uruguayan border, and northern Argentina (Zullo Jr. et al, 2011).
Brazilian potato production could be restricted to a few months in
currently warm areas, which today allow potato production year-round
(Lopes et al., 2011). Large losses of suitable environments for the “Pequi”
tree (Caryocar brasiliense, an economically important Cerrado fruit tree)
are projected by 2050, affecting mainly the poorest communities in
central Brazil (Nabout et al., 2011). In the Amazon region soybean yields
would be reduced by 44% in the worst scenario (Hadley Centre climate
prediction model 3 (HadCM3) and no CO, fertilization) by 2050 (Lapola
et al., 2011). By 2050, according to 17 GCMs under SRES A2 scenario,
80% of crops will be impacted in more than 60% of current areas of
cultivation in Colombia, with severe impacts in perennial and exportable
crops (Ramirez-Villegas et al., 2012).

of farmers in the semi-arid zones of mountain regions of Bolivia, which
began as they noticed strong changes in the climate since the 1980s,
including upward migration of crops, selection of more resistant varieties,
and water capturing—presents a further adaptation measure (PNCC,

"One approach to adapting to future climate change is by assisting people
to cope with current climate variability (Baethgen, 2010), for which the
use of climatic forecasts in agricultural planning presents a measure.
Increased access and improvement of climate forecast information
enhances the ability of farmers in the Brazilian Amazon to cope with El
Nifio impacts (Moran et al., 2006). The Southern Oscillation Index for
maize and the South Atlantic Sea Surface Temperature for soybean and
sunflower were the best indicators of annual crop yield variability in
Argentina (Travasso et al. 2009a). Another possibility to cope with extreme
events consists in transferring weather-related risks by using different
types of rural insurance (Baethgen, 2010). Index insurance is one
mechanism that has been recently introduced to overcome obstacles
to traditional agricultural and disaster insurance markets (see Chapter
15). For the support of such parametric agricultural insurance, a Central
American climate database was recently established (SICA, 2013).

"Organic systems could enhance adaptive capacity as a result of the
application of traditional skills and farmers’ knowledge, soil fertility-
building techniques, and a high degree of diversity (ITC, 2007). As
mentioned previously, crop diversity, local knowledge, soil conservation,
and economic diversity are all documented strategies for managing
risk in CA and SA. A controversial but important issue in relation to
adaptation is the use of genetically modified plants to produce food,
with biotech crops being a strategy to cope with the needed food
productivity increase considering the global population trend (see
Chapter 7). Brazil and Argentina are the second and third fastest
growing biotech crop producers in the world after the USA (Marshall,
2012). However, this option is problematic for the small farms (Mercer
et al., 2012), which are least favorable toward GMO (Soleri et al., 2008).
According to Eakin and Wehbe (2009) some practices could be an
adaptive option for specific farm enterprises, but may have maladaptive
implications at regional scales, and over time become maladaptive for
individual enterprises.

"Local and indigenous knowledge has the potential to bring solutions
even in the face of rapidly changing climatic conditions (Folke et al.,
2002; Altieri and Koohafkan, 2008), although migration, climate change,
and market integration are reducing indigenous capacity for dealing
with weather and climate risk (Pérez et al., 2010; Valdivia et al., 2010).
Crop diversification is used in the Peruvian Andes to suppress pest
outbreaks and dampen pathogen transmission (Lin, 2011). In Honduras,
Nicaragua, and Guatemala traditional practices have proven more
resilient to erosion and runoff and have helped retain more topsoil and
moisture (Holt-Gimenez, 2002). In El Salvador, if local sustainability
efforts continue, the future climate vulnerability index could only slightly
increase by 2015 (Aguilar et al., 2009). Studies with Indigenous farmers
in highland Bolivia and Peru indicate that constraints on access to key
resources must be addressed for reducing vulnerability over time
(McDowell and Hess, 2012; Sietz et al., 2012). In Guatemala and
Honduras adaptive response between coffees farmers is mainly related
to land availability, while participation in organized groups and access
to information contribute to adaptive decision making (Tucker et al.,
2010). Otherwise, adaptation may include an orientation toward non-
farming activities to sustain their livelihoods and be able to meet their
food requirements (Sietz, 2011). In NEB increasing vulnerability related
to degradation of natural resources (due to overuse of soil and water)
encouraged farmers toward off-farm activities; however, they could not
improve their well-being (Sietz et al., 2006, 2011). Migration is another
strategy in ecosystems and regions at high risk of climate hazards (see
Section 27.3.1.1). During 1970-2000 LA and the Caribbean has had a
great rate of net migration per population in the dryland zones (de
Sherbinin et al., 2012). In CA nearly 25% of the surveyed households
reported some type of migration during the coffee crisis (Tucker et al.,
2010). Some migrations—for example, Guatemala, 1960s—1990s; El
Salvador, 1950s—1980s; NEB, 1960s—present—have provoked conflict
in receiving areas (Reuveny, 2007).

the problems of water stress and intense precipitation events affecting

problems of event-related mortalities and morbidity, and infrastructure
and property damage. These risks are compounded for low-income
groups in settlements with little or no service provision, for example,
waste collection, piped drinking water, and sanitation (ECLAC, 2008).
Existing cases of flooding, air pollution, and heat waves reveal that not
only low-income groups are at risk, but also that wealthier sectors are
not spared. Factors such as high-density settlement (Barros et al., 2008)
and the characteristics of some hazards explain this—for example, poor
and wealthy alike are at risk from air pollution and temperature in
Santiago de Chile and Bogota (Romero-Lankao et al., 2012b, 2013b).

for example, according to Marengo et al. (2009b, 2013b) the number
of days with rainfall above 50 mm were almost zero during the 1950s

with increasing air pollution and worsening environmental conditions that trigger the risk of respiratory diseases, would leave the
population of the MRSP more vulnerable. Potential adaptation measures include a set of strategies that need to be developed by the
MRSP and its institutions to face these environmental changes. These include improved building controls to avoid construction in risk
areas, investment in public transportation, protection of the urban basins, and the creation of forest corridors in the collecting basins
and slope regions. The lessons learned suggest that the knowledge on the observed and projected environmental changes, as well as
on the vulnerability of populations living in risk areas, is of great importance for defining adaptation policies that in turn constitute a
first step toward building resilient cities that in turn improve urban quality of life in Brazil.

"Research in the Metropolitan Region of Sao Paulo (MRSP), between 2009 and 2011, represents a comprehensive and interdisciplinary

(Nobre et al., 2011; Marengo et al., 2013b) identify the impacts of climate extremes on the occurrence of natural disasters and
human health. These impacts are linked to a projected increase of 38% in the extension of the urban area of the MRSP by 2030,
accompanied by a projected increase in rainfall extremes. These may induce an intensification of urban flash floods and landslides,
affecting large populated areas already vulnerable to climate extremes and variability. The urbanization process in the MRSP has
been affecting the local climate, and the intensification of the heat island effect to a certain degree may be responsible for the 2°C

in heavy precipitation as well as more frequent warm nights (Silva Dias et al, 2012; Marengo et al., 2013b). By 2100, climate projections

Indeed, it has been reported that in LA the use of agricultural budgets
by governments for investment in public goods induces faster growth,
decreasing poverty and environmental degradation (Lopez and Galinato,
2007).The pressure of soy expansion due to biodiesel demand can lead
to land use change and consequently to economic teleconnections, as
suggested by Nepstad et al. (2006). These teleconnections may link
Amazon deforestation derived from soy expansion to economic growth
in some developing countries because of changes in the demand of soy.
These effects may possibly mean a decrease in jobs related to small to big

"One of the main adaptation issues is related to food versus fuel (Valentine
et al, 2012). This is important because an increase in bioenergy feedstocks
might threaten primary food production in a scenario expected to feed
future populations with an increase of 70% in production (Gruskin,
2012; Valentine et al., 2012). This is particularly important in the region,
as it has one of the highest percentages of arable land available for
food production in the world (Nellemann et al., 2009). As CA and SA
develop new strategies to produce more renewable energy there might
be a pressure for more acreage to produce bioenergy. Because climate
change will affect bioenergy and food crops at the same time, their
effects, as well as the adaptation measures related to agriculture,
will be similar. The main risks identified by Arvizu et al. (2011) are (1)
business as usual, (2) unreconciled growth, and (3) environment and
food versus fuel. Thus, the most important adaptation measures will
be the ones related to the control of economic growth, environmental
management, and agriculture production. The choice for lignocellulosic
feedstocks (e.g., sugarcane second-generation technologies) will be an
important mitigation/adaptation measure because these feedstocks do
not compete with food (Arvizu et al., 2011). In the case of sugarcane,
for instance, an increase of approximately 40% in the production of
bioethanol is expected as a result of the implantation of second-
generation technologies coupled with the first-generation ones already
existent in Brazil (Dias et al., 2012; de Souza et al., 2013).

"In developing and emergent countries, there exists a general consensus
that the adaptive capacity is low, strengthened by the fact that poverty
is the key determinant of vulnerability in LA (to climate-related natural
hazards; see Rubin and Rossing, 2012) and thus a limit to resilience
(Pettengell, 2010) leading to a “low human development trap” (UNDP,
2007). However, Magnan (2009, p. 1) suggests that this analysis is biased
by a “relative immaturity of the science of adaptation to explain what
are the processes and the determinants of adaptive capacity.” Increasing
research efforts on the study of adaptation is therefore of great
importance to improve understanding of the actual societal, economical,
community, and individual drivers defining the adaptive capacity.
Especially, a major focus on traditions and their transmission (Young
and Lipton, 2006) may actually indicate potential adaption potentials
in remote and economically poor regions of SA and CA. Such a potential
does not dismiss the fact that the nature of future challenges may
actually not be compared to past climate variability (e.g., glacier retreat

"During the last few years, the study of adaptation to climate change
has progressively switched from an impact-focused approach (mainly
climate-driven) to include a vulnerability-focused vision (Boulanger et
al. 2011). As a consequence, the development and implementation of
systemic adaptation strategies, involving institutional, social, ecosystem,
environmental, financial, and capacity components (see Chapter 14) to
cope with present climate extreme events is a key step toward climate
change adaptation, especially in SA and CA countries. Although different
frameworks and definitions of vulnerability exist, a general tendency
aims at studying vulnerability to climate change, especially in SA and
CA, focusing on the following aspects: urban vulnerability (e.g., Hardoy

(McSweeney and Coomes, 2011; Ravera et al., 2011), rural farmer

approach used can be holistic or systemic (Ison, 2010; Carey et al., 2012b),

hazards, institutional support, committed individuals, and international
involvement) as well as impediments (divergent risk perceptions, imposed
government policies, institutional instability, knowledge disparities, and
invisible hazards). In certain cases, forward-looking learning (anticipatory
process), as a contrast to learning by shock (reactive process), has been
found as a key element for adaptation and resilience (Tschakert and
Dietrich, 2010) and should be promoted as a tool for capacity-

"processes do not always respond specifically to climate forcing. For
instance, the agricultural sector adapts rapidly to economic stressors,
although, despite a clear perception of climate risks, it may last longer
before responding to climate changes (Tucker et al., 2010). In certain
regions or communities, such as Anchioreta in Brazil (Schlindwein et al.,
2011), adaptation is part of a permanent process and is actually tackled
through a clear objective of vulnerability reduction, maintaining and
diversifying a large set of natural varieties of corn, allowing the farmers
to diversify their planting. Another kind of autonomous adaptation is
the southward displacement of agriculture activities (e.g., wine, coffee)
through the purchase of lands, which will become favorable for such
agriculture activities in a warmer climate. In Argentina, the increase of

some lessons have already been learned from these first experiences

for Adaptation (IUPA) to evaluate adaptation practices, have been
developed for the region (Debels et al., 2009). Evidenced by these
practical experiences, there is a wide range of options to foster adaptation

not separate issues. Development and adaptation strategies especially
should be tackled together in developing countries such as SA and CA,
focusing on strategies to reduce vulnerability. The poor level of adaptation
of present-day climate in SA and CA countries is characterized by the
fact that responses to disasters are mainly reactive rather than preventive.
Some early warning systems are being implemented, but the capacity
of responding to a warning is often limited, particularly among poor

"However, local adaptation to climate and non-climate drivers may
undermine long-term resilience of socio-ecological systems when local,
short-term strategies designed to deal with specific threats or challenges
do not integrate a more holistic and long-term vision of the system at
threat (Adger et al., 2011). Thus, policy should identify the sources of
and conditions for local resilience and strengthen their capacities to
adapt and learn (Borsdorf and Coy, 2009; Adger et al., 2011; Eakin et
al., 2011), as well as to integrate new adapted tools (Oft, 2010). This
sets the question of convergence between the local-scale/short-term
and broad-scale/long-term visions in terms of perceptions of risks, needs
to adapt, and appropriate policies to be implemented (Eakin and Wehbe,
2009; Salzmann et al., 2009). Even if funding for adaptation is available,
the overarching problem is the lack of capacity and/or willingness to
address the risks, especially those threatening lower income groups
(Satterthwaite, 2011a). Adaptation to climate change cannot eliminate
the extreme weather risks, and thus efforts should focus on disaster
preparedness and post-disaster response (Sverdlik, 2011). Migration is

"In terms of framing adaptation, as a constraint to affect the adaptation
context, it is usually considered that a major barrier to adaptation is
the perception of risks, and many studies focused on such an issue (e.g.,
Schlindwein et al, 2011). New studies (Adger et al., 2009) identified
social limits to possible adaptation to climate change in relation with
issues of values and ethics, risk, knowledge, and culture, even though
such limits can evolve in time. Indeed, while being a necessary condition,
perception may not be the main driver for initiating an adaptation
process. As pointed out by Tucker et al. (2010) with a specific focus on

offer adaptation and mitigation benefits. On one hand, fossil-based
energy consumption is reduced, while energy availability is increased.
On the other hand, reduction of energy precariousness is key in any
development strategy. Thus, it allows local community and individuals
to grow socially and economically, and therefore to reduce vulnerability,
avoiding the poverty trap (UNDP, 2007), and to initiate an adaptation
process based on non-fossil fuel energy sources. Such initiatives also
depend on local and organizational leaderships (UN-HABITAT, 2011).

manages recycling or renewable energy production, leading to an
increase in energy availability, thus production capacity, and therefore

Valdivia, 2010); access to and quality of natural resources (Lopez-

"CA, exogenous factors (economic, land tenure, cost, etc.) may actually
strongly constrain the decision-making process involved in a possible
adaptation process. In that sense, efficient governance and management
are key components in the use of climate and non-climate information
in the decision-making and adaptation process. As a consequence, it is
difficult to describe adaptation without defining at which level it is
thought. Indeed, though much effort is invested in national and regional
policy initiatives, most of the final adaptation efforts will be local.
National and international (transborder) governance is key to build
adaptive capacity (Engle and Lemos, 2010) and therefore to strengthen
(or weaken) local adaptation through efficient policies and delivery of
resources. At a smaller scale (Agrawal, 2008), local institutions can
strongly contribute to vulnerability reduction and adaptation. However,
at all levels, the efficiency in national and local adaptation activities
strongly depend on the capacity-building and information transmission
to decision makers (Eakin and Lemos, 2006).

by arguing that it encompasses three complementary approaches: (1)
the one above, that is, commodification of predefined ecosystem services
so that prices can be negotiated between buyers and sellers; plus (2)
compensation for opportunities forgone voluntarily or by command and
control decisions; and (3) coinvestment in environmental stewardships.

"Hydropower is the main source of renewable energy in CA and SA (see
Section 27.3.6). The region is second only to Asia in terms of hydropower
energy generation in the world, displaying a 20% share of total annual
generation and an average regional capacity factor of greater than 50%
(SRREN Table 5-1; IPCC, 2011). As a result, the region has by far the
largest proportion of electricity generated through hydropower facilities
(Table 27-6). The hydropower proportion of total electricity production
is greater than 40% in the region, and in some cases is near or close to
80%, as in the case of Brazil, Colombia, and Costa Rica (IEA, 2012).
Although there is debate, especially in tropical environments, about GHG
emissions from hydropower reservoirs (Fearnside and Pueyo, 2012), this
form of electricity generation is often seen as a major contributor to
mitigating GHG emissions worldwide (see IPCC, 2011; Kumar et al., 2011).
But, on the other hand, hydropower is a climate-related sector, thus
making it prone to the potential effects of changing climate conditions
(see Section 27.3.1.1). In this regard the CA and SA region constitutes
a unique example to study these relations between climate change
mitigation and adaptation in relation to hydropower generation.
"	Text
"Diverse studies have analyzed the potential impacts of climate change
on hydropower generation (Table 27-4). Maurer et al. (2009) studied
future conditions for the Lempa River (El Salvador, Honduras, and
Guatemala), showing a potential reduction in hydropower capacity of
33 to 53% by 2070-2099. A similar loss is expected for the Sinu-Caribe
basin in Colombia where, despite a general projection of increased
precipitation, losses due to evaporation enhancement reduce inflows
to hydroelectric systems, thus reducing electricity generation up to 35%
(Ospina Norefia et al., 2009a). Further studies (Ospina Norejia et al.,
2011a,b) have estimated vulnerability indices for the hydropower sector
in the same basin, and identified reservoir operation strategies to reduce
this vulnerability. Overall reductions in hydropower generation capacity
are also expected in Chile for the main hydropower generation river
basins (Maule, Laja, and Biobio (ECLAC, 2009a; McPhee et al., 2010; Stehr
et al., 2010)), and also in the Argentinean Limay River basin (Seoane and
Lopez, 2007). Ecuador, on the other hand, faces an increase in generation
capacity associated with an increment in precipitation on its largest
hydroelectric generator, the Paute River basin (Buytaert et al., 2010).

"An obvious implication of the mentioned impacts is the need to replace
the energy lost through alternative (see Section 27.3.6.2) or traditional
sources. Adaptation measures have been studied for Brazil (de Lucena
et al., 2010a), with results implying an increase in natural gas and
sugarcane bagasse electricity generation on the order of 300 TWh,
increase in operation costs on the order of US$7 billion annually, and
US$50 billion in terms of investment costs by 2035. In Chile, the study
by ECLAC (2009a) assumed that the loss in hydropower generation, on
the order of 18 TWh for the 2011-2040 period (a little over 10% of
actual total hydropower generation capacity) would be compensated by
the least operating cost source available, coal-fired power plant, implying
an increase of 2 MT CO,-eq of total GHG emissions (emissions for the
electricity sector in Chile totaled 25 MT CO,-eq in 2009). Ospina Norejia
(2011a,b) studied some adaptation options, such as changes in water
use efficiency or demand growth that could mitigate the expected
impacts on hydropower systems in the Colombian Sinu-Caribe River
basin. Changes in seasonality and total availability could also increase
complexities in the management of multiple-use dedicated basins in
Peru (Juen et al., 2007; Condom et al., 2012), Chile (ECLAC, 2009a), and
Argentina (Seoane and Ldpez, 2007), that could affect the relationship
between different water users within a basin. It is worth noting that
those regions that are projected to face an increase in streamflow and
associated generation capacity, such as Ecuador or Costa Rica, also
share difficulties in managing deforestation, erosion, and sedimentation
which limits the useful life of reservoirs (see Section 27.3.1.1). In these
cases it is important to consider these effects in future infrastructure
operation (Ferreira and Teegavarapu, 2012) and planning, and also to
enhance the ongoing process of recognizing the value of the relation
between ecosystem services and hydropower system operations (Leguia
et al., 2008) (see more on PES in Sections 27.3.2.2, 27.6.2).

as fish are more difficult to monitor than terrestrial resources), and
definition of resource boundaries in offshore water. One example of a
compensation mechanism in the region is the so-called defeso, in Brazil.
It consists of a period (reproductive season) when fishing is forbidden
by the government and fishermen receive a financial compensation. It
applies to shrimp, lobster, and both marine and freshwater fisheries

"Services subjected to such types of agreements often include regulation
of freshwater flows, carbon storage, provision of habitat for biodiversity,

Because the ecosystems that provide the services are mostly privately
owned, policies often aim at supporting landowners to maintain the
provision of services over time (Kemkes et al., 2010). Irrespective of the
debate as to whether payments or compensations should be designed
to focus on actions or results (Gibbons et al., 2011), experiences in
Colombia, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua show that PES can finance
conservation, ecosystem restoration, and better land use practices
(Montagnini and Finney, 2011; see also Table 27-5). However, based on
examples from Ecuador and Guatemala, Southgate et al. (2010) argue
that uniformity of payment for beneficiaries can be inefficient if recipients
accept less compensation in return for conservation measures, or if
recipients that promote greater environmental gains receive only the
prevailing payment. Other setbacks to PES schemes might include cases
where there is a perception of commoditization of nature and its
intangible values (e.g., Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador, and Venezuela); other
cases where mechanisms are inefficient to reduce poverty; and slowness
to build trust between buyers and sellers, as well as gender and land

and environmental risks in daily life, and climate change will add a new
dimension to these risks. Because urban development remains fragile
in many cases, with weak planning responses, climate change can
compound existing challenges, for example, water supply in cities from
glacier, snowmelt, and paramos related runoff in the Andes (Lima, La
Paz/El Alto, Santiago de Chile, Bogota), flooding in several cities such
as Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires, and health-related challenges in many
cities of the region.

"and tourism, and diseases control in CA and SA. Coral reefs, mangroves,
fisheries, and other benthic marine invertebrates that provide key
ecosystem services, such as nutrient cycling, water quality regulation,
and herbivory, are also threatened by climate change. It is possible that
the Mesoamerican coral reef will collapse by mid-century (between
2050 and 2070), causing major economic and environmental losses. In
the southwestern Atlantic coast, eastern Brazilian reefs might suffer a
massive coral cover decline in the next 50 years. In the Rio de La Plata
area extreme flooding events may become more frequent because
return periods are decreasing, and urban coastal areas in the eastern
coast will be particularly affected. Beach erosion is expected to increase
in southern Brazil and in scattered areas at the Pacific coast.

"Changes in food production and food security are expected to have
great spatial variability, with a wide range of uncertainty mainly related
to climate and crop models. In SESA average productivity could be
sustained or increased until the mid-century, although interannual and
decadal climate variability is likely to impose important damages. In
other regions such as NEB, CA, and some Andean countries agricultural
productivity could decrease in the short term, threatening the food
security of the poorest population. The expansion of pastures and
croplands is expected to continue in the coming years, particularly from
an increasing global demand for food and biofuels. The great challenge
for CA and SA will be to increase the food and bioenergy production
and at the same time sustain the environmental quality in a scenario
of climate change.

"productivity and production. Advances in second-generation biofuels
will be important as a measure of adaptation, as they have the potential
to increase biofuel productivity. In spite of the large amount of arable
land available, the expansion of biofuels might have some direct and
indirect land use change effects, producing teleconnections that could
lead to deforestation of native tropical forests and loss of employment
in some countries. This might also affect food security.

"Changes in weather and climatic patterns are negatively affecting human
health in CA and SA, by increasing morbidity, mortality, and disabilities,
and through the emergence of diseases in previously non-endemic
regions. Multiple factors increase the region's vulnerability to climate
change: precarious health systems; malnutrition; inadequate water
and sanitation services; population growth; poor waste collection and
treatment systems; air, soil, and water pollution; food in poor regions;
lack of social participation; and inadequate governance. Vulnerabilities
vary with geography, age, gender, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic
status, and are rising in large cities. Climate change and variability may
exacerbate current and future risks to health.

"to climate change is to reduce the vulnerability to present climate,
taking into account future potential impacts, particularly of weather
and climate extremes. Long-term planning and the related human and
financial resource needs may be seen as conflicting with present social
deficit in the welfare of the CA and SA population. Such conditions
weaken the importance of adaptation planning to climate change on
the political agenda. Currently, there are few experiences on synergies
between development, adaptation, and mitigation planning, which can
help local communities and governments to allocate available resources
in the design of strategies to reduce vulnerability and develop adaptation
measures. Facing a new climate system and, in particular, the exacerbation
of extreme events, will call for new ways to manage human and natural
systems for achieving sustainable development.

"	Title
"Additional and stronger scientific evidence has accumulated since the AR4 that reinforces key findings made in the Fourth Assessment Report
(AR4).
"	Text
"Rising temperatures, leading to the further thawing of permafrost, and changing precipitation patterns have the potential to
affect infrastructure and related services in the Arctic (high confidence). {28.3.4.3} Particular concerns are associated with damage to
residential buildings resulting from thawing permafrost, including Arctic cities; small, rural settlements; and storage facilities for hazardous
materials. {28.2.4-5}
"	Text
"The impacts of climate change, and the adaptations to it, exhibit strong spatial heterogeneity in the polar regions because of the
high diversity of social systems, biophysical regions, and associated drivers of change (high confidence). {28.2.2} For example, the
tree line has moved northward and upward in many, but not all, Arctic areas (high confidence) and significant increases in tall shrubs and
grasses have been observed in many places (very high confidence). {28.2.3.1.2}
"	Text
"The physical, biological, and socioeconomic impacts of climate change in the Arctic have to be seen in the context of often
interconnected factors that include not only environmental changes caused by drivers other than climate change but also
demography, culture, and economic development. Climate change has compounded some of the existing vulnerabilities caused by these
other factors (high confidence). {28.2.4-5, 28.4} For example, food security for many Indigenous and rural residents in the Arctic is being

impacted by climate change, and in combination with globalization and resource development food insecurity is projected to increase in the
future (high confidence). {28.2.4}
"	Text
"The rapid rate at which climate is changing in the polar regions will impact natural and social systems (high confidence) and may
exceed the rate at which some of their components can successfully adapt (low to medium confidence). {28.2.4, 28.4} The decline
of Arctic sea ice in summer is occurring at a rate that exceeds most of the earlier generation model projections (high confidence), and evidence
of similarly rapid rates of change is emerging in some regions of Antarctica. {WGI AR5 Chapters 4, 5, 9} In the future, trends in polar regions of
populations of marine mammals, fish, and birds will be a complex response to multiple stressors and indirect effects (high confidence). {28.3.2}
Already, accelerated rates of change in permafrost thaw, loss of coastal sea ice, sea level rise, and increased weather intensity are forcing
relocation of some Indigenous communities in Alaska (high confidence). {28.2.4.2, 28.2.5, 28.3.4}
"	Text
"Some marine species will shift their ranges in response to changing ocean and sea ice conditions in the polar regions (medium
confidence). The response rate and the spatial extent of the shifts will differ by species based on their vulnerability to change and their life
history. {28.2.2, 28.3.2} Loss of sea ice in summer and increased ocean temperatures are expected to impact secondary pelagic production in
some regions of the Arctic Ocean, with associated changes in the energy pathways within the marine ecosystem (medium confidence). These
changes are expected to alter the species composition of zooplankton in some regions, with associated impacts on some fish and shellfish
populations (medium confidence). {28.2.2.1} Also, changes in sea ice and the physical environment to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula are
altering phytoplankton stocks and productivity, and krill (high confidence). {28.2.2.2}
"	Text
"Impacts on the health and well-being of Arctic residents from climate change are significant and projected to increase—especially
for many Indigenous peoples (high confidence). {28.2.4} These impacts are expected to vary among the diverse settlements, which range
from small, remote, predominantly Indigenous communities to large cities and industrial settlements (high confidence), especially those in

highly vulnerable locations along ocean and river shorelines. {28.2.4}
"	Text
"Ocean acidification has the potential to inhibit embryo development and shell formation of some zooplankton and krill in the
polar regions, with potentially far-reaching consequences to food webs in these regions (medium confidence). Embryos of Antarctic
krill have been shown to be vulnerable to increased concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO,) in the water (high confidence). As well, there is
increasing evidence that pelagic molluscs (pteropods) are vulnerable to ocean acidification (medium confidence). {28.2.2, 28.3.2}
"	Text
"Shifts in the timing and magnitude of seasonal biomass production could disrupt matched phenologies in the food webs, leading
to decreased survival of dependent species (medium confidence). If the timing of primary and secondary production is no longer
matched to the timing of spawning or egg release, survival could be impacted, with cascading implications to higher trophic levels. This impact
would be exacerbated if shifts in timing occur rapidly (medium confidence). {28.2.2, 28.3.2} Climate change will increase the vulnerability of
terrestrial ecosystems to invasions by non-indigenous species, the majority likely to arrive through direct human assistance (high confidence).
"	Text
"There is increased evidence that climate change will have large effects on Arctic communities, especially where narrowly based
economies leave a smaller range of adaptive choices. {28.2.6.1, 28.4} Some commercial activities will become more profitable while
others will face decline. Increased economic opportunities are expected with increased navigability in the Arctic Ocean and the expansion of
some land- and freshwater-based transportation networks. {28.2.6.1.3, 28.3.4.3} The informal, subsistence-based economy will be impacted
(high confidence). There is high confidence that changing sea ice conditions may result in more difficult access for hunting marine mammals.
{28.2.6.1.6} Although Arctic residents have a history of adapting to change, the complex interlinkages among societal, economic, and political
factors and climatic stresses represent unprecedented challenges for northern communities, particularly if the rate of change will be faster than
the social systems can adapt (high confidence). {28.2.5, 28.4}

"Changes in the physical and chemical environments of the polar regions
are detailed in the WGI contribution to the ARS. There is evidence that
Arctic land surface temperatures have warmed substantially since the
mid-20th century, and the future rate of warming is expected to exceed
the global rate. Sea ice extent at the summer minimum has decreased
significantly in recent decades, and the Arctic Ocean is projected to
become nearly ice free in summer within this century. The duration of
snow cover extent and snow depth are decreasing in North America while

"increasing in Eurasia. Since the late 1970s, permafrost temperatures
have increased between 0.5°C and 2°C. In the Southern Hemisphere,
the strongest rates of atmospheric warming are occurring in the western
Antarctic Peninsula (WAP, between 0.2°C and 0.3°C per decade) and
the islands of the Scotia Arc, where there have also been increases in
oceanic temperatures and large regional decreases in winter sea ice
extent and duration. Warming, although less than WAP, has also occurred
in the continental margins near the Bellingshausen Sea, Prydz Bay, and
the Ross Sea, with areas of cooling in between. Land regions have
experienced glacial recession and changes in the ice and permafrost
habitats in the coastal margins. The Southern Ocean continues to warm,
with increased freshening at the surface due to precipitation leading to
increased stratification. In both polar regions, as a result of acidification,
surface waters will become seasonally corrosive to aragonite within
decades, with some regions being affected sooner than others (see
Box CC-OA; WGI AR5 Chapter 6). Observations and models indicate that
the carbon cycle of the Arctic and Southern Oceans will be impacted by
climate change and increased carbon dioxide (CO,).
"	Text
"Several recent climate impact assessments on polar regions have been
undertaken, including the synthesis report on Snow, Water, Ice and
Permafrost in the Arctic (AMAP, 2011a), the State of the Arctic Coast
2010 (2011) reports, the Antarctic Climate and the Environment (Turner
et al., 2009, 2013), Arctic Resilience Interim Report 2013 (2013), and
the findings of the International Polar Year (IPY; Krupnick et al., 2011).
These reports draw a consistent pattern of climate-driven environmental,
societal, and economic changes in the polar regions in recent decades.
In this chapter, we use the scientific literature, including these reports,
to consolidate the assessment of the impacts of climate change on polar
regions from 2007, advance new scientific evidence of impacts, and
identify key gaps in knowledge on current and future impacts. Previous
IPCC reports define the Arctic as the area within the Arctic Circle (66°N),
and the Antarctic as the continent with surrounding Southern Ocean
south of the polar front, which is generally close to 58° (IPCC, 2007).
For the purpose of this report we use the conventional IPCC definitions
as a basis, while incorporating a degree of flexibility when describing
the polar regions in relation to particular subjects.

"The aquatic ecosystem health and biodiversity of northern deltas is
dependent on combined changes in the elevation of spring river ice-
jam floods and sea level (Lesack and Marsh, 2007, 2010). Diminishing
ice shelves (last half-century) have also caused a decline in the number
of freshwater epishelf lakes that develop behind them (Veillette et al.,
2008; Vincent et al., 2009). Although such biophysical dependencies
have been established, temporal trends in such river-delta and epishelf
lake impacts and their linkages to changing climate remain to be

anadromous fish. Key examples include the timing of marine exit of Yukon
River Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha; 1961-2009) varied

2011); the growth of young-of-year Arctic cisco (Coregonus autumnalis;
1978-2004) varied in response to lagged sea ice concentration and
Mackenzie River discharge, also indicating that decreased sea ice
concentration and increased river discharge enhanced marine primary
production, leading to more favorable foraging conditions (von Biela et
al., 2011); and factors that influence the water level and freshening of
rivers, as well as the strength, duration, and directions of prevailing
coastal winds, affect survival of anadromous fishes during coastal

"The surface-water temperatures of large water bodies has warmed
(1985-2009; Schneider and Hook, 2010), particularly for mid- and high
latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, with spatial patterns generally
matching those for air temperature. Where water bodies warmed more
rapidly than air temperature, decreasing ice cover was suggested as
enhancing radiative warming. Paleolimnological evidence indicates that
the highest primary productivity was associated with warm, ice-free
summer conditions and the lowest with periods of perennial ice (Melles
et al. 2007). Increasing water temperatures affect planktonic and benthic
biomass and lead to changes in species composition (Christoffersen et
al., 2008; Heino et al., 2009, Jansson et al., 2010). Reduced ice cover
with higher air temperatures and evaporation are responsible for the

changes (Milliman et al., 2008) but has been, including more recent
extreme increases (2007), attributed to enhanced poleward atmospheric
moisture transport (Zhang et al., 2013). By contrast, decreased flow in
high-latitude Canadian rivers (1964-2000; average —10%) does match
that for precipitation (Déry and Wood, 2005). Recent data (1977-2007)
for 19 circumpolar rivers also indicate an area-weighted average increase
of +9.8% (-17.1 to 47.0%; Overeem and Syvitski, 2010) accompanied
by shifts in flow timing, with May snowmelt increasing (avg. 66%) but
flow in the subsequent month of peak discharge decreasing (~7%).
Across the Russian Arctic, dates of spring maximum discharge have also
started to occur earlier, particularly in the most recent (1960-2001)
period analyzed (average —5 days; range for four regions +0.2 to -7.1
days), but no consistent trend exists for magnitude (average —1%; range
+21 to -24%; Shiklomanov et al., 2007). Earlier timing was most pro-

"Biota of Antarctic freshwater systems (lakes, ponds, short streams,
and seasonally wetted areas) are dominated by benthic microbial
communities of cyanobacteria and green algae in a simple food web.
Mosses occur in some continental lakes with higher plants absent.
Planktonic ecosystems are typically depauperate and include small algae,
bacteria, and colorless flagellates, with few metazoans and no fish
(Quesada and Velazquez, 2012). Recent compilations of single-year data
sets have reinforced previous conclusions on the changing freshwater
habitats in Antarctica (Verleyen et al, 2012). In regions where the climate
has warmed, the physical impacts on aquatic ecosystems include loss of
ice and perennial snow cover, increasing periods of seasonal open water,
increased water column temperatures, and changes in water column
stratification. In some areas, a negative water balance has occurred as
a result of increased temperature and changes in wind strength driving
enhanced evaporation and sublimation and leading to increased salinity
in lakes in recent decades (Hodgson et al., 2006a). In other areas,
especially glacial forelands, increased temperatures have led to greater
volumes of seasonal meltwater in streams and lakes together with
increased nutrient fluxes (high confidence). In both cases, the balance
between precipitation and evaporation can have detectable effects on
lake ecosystems (medium confidence) through changes in water body
volume and lake chemistry (Lyons et al., 2006; Quesada et al., 2006).
Non-dilute lakes with a low lake depth to surface area ratio are most
susceptible to interannual and inter-decadal variability in the water
balance, as measured by changes in specific conductance (high confidence;
Verleyen et al., 2012). Warming in the northwestern Antarctic Peninsula
region has resulted in permafrost degradation in the last approximately
50 years, impacting surface geomorphology and hydrology (Bockheim
et al. 2013) with the potential to increase soil biomass.

"The timing of spring phytoplankton blooms is a function of seasonal light,
hydrographic conditions, and the timing of sea ice breakup (Wassman,

large ice algal blooms can form under the sea ice (Arrigo, 2012). During
the period 1997-2009, a trend toward earlier phytoplankton blooms
was detected in approximately 11% of the area of the Arctic Ocean
(Kahru et al., 2011). This advanced timing of annual phytoplankton
blooms coincided with decreased sea ice concentration in early summer.
Brown and Arrigo (2013) studied the timing and intensity of spring
blooms in the Bering Sea from 1997 to 2010 and found that in northern
regions sea ice consistently retreated in late spring and was associated
with ice-edge blooms, whereas in the southern regions the timing of
sea ice retreat varied, with ice-edge blooms associated with late ice
retreat, and open water blooms associated with early ice retreat. Given
the short time series and limited studies, there is medium confidence

fish and shellfish species along latitudinal and depth gradients showed
observed spatial shifts were consistent with expected responses of
species to climate change (Simpson et al., 2011; Poloczanska et al.,

Barents Sea, and the northeast Atlantic Ocean and Icelandic waters
showed that fish shift their spatial distribution in response to climate

There are limits to the movement potential of some species. Vulnerability
assessments indicate that the movement of some sub-Arctic fish and
shellfish species into the Arctic Ocean may be impeded by the presence
of water temperatures on the shelves that fall below their thermal
tolerances (Hollowed et al., 2013; Hunt, Jr. et al., 2013). Coupled
biophysical models have reproduced the observed spatial dynamics of
some the species in the Bering and Barents Seas, and are being used to
explain the role of climate variability and change on the distribution
and abundance of some species (Huse and Ellingsen, 2008; Parada et
al., 2010). In summary, there is medium to high confidence based on
observations and modeling that some fish and shellfish have shifted their

extrinsic factor affecting Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus), with
predictions of distribution changes, reduced calf recruitment, and longer

habitats energetically unprofitable for ringed seals (Freitas et al., 2008).
Ice loss threatens Baltic ringed seals (Kovacs and Lydersen, 2008). In
Hudson Bay, earlier spring break-up and changes in snow cover over
lairs have reduced ringed seal recruitment (Ferguson et al., 2005).
Changes in snowfall over the 21st century were projected to reduce
ringed seal habitat for lairs by 70% (Hezel et al., 2012). Similarly, harp
seal (Pagophilus groenlandicus) breeding habitat was affected by
changing ice conditions that could reduce pup survival (Bajzak et al.,

Antarctic Peninsula region (medium confidence; Wiedenmann et al., 2009)
but these declines may have been offset by increased growth arising
from increased water temperature in that area (Wiedenmann et al.,
2008). However, near South Georgia krill productivity may have declined
as a result of the increased metabolic costs of increasing temperatures
(low confidence; Hill et al., 2013). The combined effects of changing sea
ice, temperature, and food have not been investigated.

Gutt et al., 2011). More icebergs are grounding, causing changes in

(Atkinson et al., 2004), in parallel with regional declines in the extent
and duration of winter sea ice (Flores et al., 2012). Uncertainty remains
over changes in the krill population because this decline was observed
using net samples and is not reflected in acoustic abundance time series
(Nicol and Brierley, 2010); the observed changes in krill density may
have been partly a result of changes in distribution (Murphy et al.,

the krill population may already have changed and will be subject to

result of fisheries while others are recovering from past over-exploitation,
either of which may confound interpretation of the response of these

fur seals on some sub-Antarctic islands has been well documented, and
their populations may now be competing with krill-eating macaroni
penguins (Trathan et al. 2012). More recently, there has been confirmation
that populations of some Antarctic whales are recovering, such as
humpbacks (Nicol et al., 2008; Zerbini et al., 2010), suggesting that food
is currently not limiting. In contrast, a number of albatross and petrel
populations are declining as a result of incidental mortality in longline
fisheries in southern and temperate waters where these birds forage

"contrast, gentoo penguins are increasing in that region and expanding
south (high confidence; Lynch et al., 2012). This may be explained by the
reduced sea ice habitats and krill availability in the north, resulting in a
southward shift of krill predators, particularly those dependent on sea
ice (Forcada et al., 2012) and the replacement of these predators in the
north by species that do not depend on sea ice, such as gentoo penguins
and elephant seals (low confidence; Costa et al., 2010; Trivelpiece et al.,
2011; Ducklow et al., 2012; Murphy et al., 2013). A contrasting situation
is in the Ross Sea, where Adélie penguin populations have increased
(Smith, Jr. et al., 2012). The mechanisms driving these changes are
currently under review and may be more than simply sea ice (Lynch et
al., 2012; Melbourne-Thomas et al., 2013). For example, too much or
too little sea ice may have negative effects on the demography of Adélie
and emperor penguins (see Barbraud et al., 2012, for review). Also,
increased snow precipitation that accumulates in breeding colonies can
decrease survival of chicks of Adélie penguins when accompanied by
reduced food supply (Chapman et al., 2011).

warmth index (sum of the monthly mean temperatures above freezing

by 5°C per month for the Arctic as a whole (Xu et al., 2013). However,
the even greater 10°C to 12°C per month increase for the land adjacent
to the Chukchi and Bering Seas (Figure 28-3) was associated with
decreases in NDVI. On the Yamal Peninsula in Russia the pattern of NDVI
is partly due to surface disturbance, such as landslide activity (Walker

decreasing biomass and changing plant species composition (Olofsson

interpreted with care.

erosion, increased drought, and thawing of permafrost, resulting in loss
of reservoirs, damage to landfill sites, or sewage contamination (GAO,

"Indigenous populations in the Arctic—the original Native inhabitants
of the region—are considered especially vulnerable to climate change
because of their close relationship with the environment and its natural
resources for physical, social, and cultural well-being (Nuttall et al.,
2005; Parkinson, 2009; Cochran et al., 2013). Although there are wide
differences in the estimates, including variations in definitions of the
Arctic region, Arctic Indigenous peoples are estimated to number
between 400,000 and 1.3 million (Bogoyavlensky and Siggner, 2004;
Galloway-McLean, 2010). According to 2010 census data, there are
approximately 68,000 Indigenous people living in the Russian Arctic.
These Arctic residents depend heavily on the region’s terrestrial, marine,
and freshwater renewable resources, including fish, mammals, birds,
and plants; however, the ability of Indigenous peoples to maintain
traditional livelihoods such as hunting, harvesting, and herding is
increasingly being threatened by the unprecedented rate of climate
change (high confidence; Nakashima et al., 2012; Cochran et al., 2013). In
habitats across the Arctic, climate changes are affecting these livelihoods
through decreased sea ice thickness and extent, less predictable weather,
severe storms, sea level rise, changing seasonal melt/freeze-up of rivers
and lakes, changes in snow type and timing, increasing shrub growth,
permafrost thaw, and storm-related erosion, which, in turn, are causing
such severe loss of land in some regions that a number of Alaskan
coastal villages are having to relocate entire communities (Oskal, 2008;
Forbes and Stammler, 2009; Mahoney et al., 2009; Bartsch et al., 2010;

must at the same time consider multiple other stressors such as resource
development (oil and gas, mining); pollution; changes in land use policies;
changing forms of governance; and the prevalence in many Indigenous
communities of poverty, marginalization, and resulting health disparities

"As well as methane, increased water temperatures are projected to lead
to reduced organic carbon (OC) burial. Projections, based on a range of
six climate warming scenarios (IPCC, 2007), indicate that there will be
a 4 to 27% decrease (0.9 to 6.4 TgC yr’) in OC burial across lakes of
the northern boreal zone by the end of the 21st century as compared
to rates for the approximately last half-century (Gudasz et al, 2010).
Although these estimates assume that future OC delivery will be similar
to present-day conditions, even with enhanced supply from thawing
permafrost, higher water temperatures will increase OC mineralization
and thereby lower burial efficiency. The amount of burial also depends
on lake depth and mixing regimes. For non-thermally stratified shallow
lakes, there will be a greater opportunity for water-sediment mixing,
and hence greater carbon recycling back into the water column. By
contrast, for lakes that become increasingly thermally stratified, carbon
sinking below the thermocline will tend not to return to the surface until
an increasing later fall turnover, thereby decreasing the probability of
sediment-stored carbon being returned to the water column (Flanagan
et al., 2006).

3.4.5; WGI ARS Section 12.4.5.4) are earlier spring runoff (Pohl et al.,

spring snowmelt (Adam et al., 2009), and increases in spring sediment
fluxes (Lewis and Lamoureux, 2010). Enhanced permafrost thaw (WGI
AR3 Section 12.4.6.2) will continue to affect the dynamics of thermokarst
lakes and related ecological effects (Section 28.2.1.1). Thawing permafrost
and changes in the hydrological regime of the Arctic rivers, particularly
those traversing regions affected by industrial developments, will increase
the contaminant flow (Nikanorov et al., 2007). Loss of glacier ice masses
will alter runoff hydrographs; sediment loads; water chemistry; thermal
regimes; and related channel stability, habitat, and biodiversity (Milner
et al., 2009; Moore et al., 2009). Although snow, freshwater ice, and
permafrost affect the morphology of arctic alluvial channels, their future
combined effects remain unclear (McNamara and Kane, 2009). For small
permafrost streams, however, longer projected periods of flowing water
will modify nutrient and organic matter processing (Greenwald et al.,
2008; Zarnetske et al., 2008) but long-term negative impacts of increased
sediment load on biological productivity could outweigh any positive
effects from increased nutrient loading (Bowden et al., 2008).

shells are thinner from sediment traps in aragonite undersaturated water

marine fish stocks potentially will shift their distributions into the Arctic
Ocean, resulting in an increase in biodiversity in the region (Cheung et
al., 2009, 2011; see also Box CC-MB). However, other studies show the
persistence of cold seawater temperatures on the shelf regions of the
Arctic Ocean and northern Bering Sea will restrict or retard movement
of several sub-Arctic fish and shellfish species into the Arctic Ocean
(Sigler et al., 2011; Stabeno et al., 2012b; Hunt, Jr. et al., 2013). In waters
off the coasts of Europe there is a potential for increased fish production
because of the combined effects of intrusion of Atlantic water over the
relatively broader shelf regions and advective corridors for larval drift
and range expansion of spawners. Huse and Ellingsen (2008) forced a
spatially explicit coupled biophysical model for the Barents Sea with
future climate scenarios to project the implications of climate change
on the spawning distribution of capelin (Mallotus villosus). Projections
show that the spawning distribution of capelin will shift to the east and
new spawning grounds will be colonized. A key factor governing this
expansion will be the availability of pelagic prey. In the southeast Bering
Sea, there is evidence that planktivorous species such as walleye pollock
will shift their distribution in response to shifts in ocean temperature
(Kotwicki and Lauth, 2013). In summary, the spatial distribution of some
fish and shellfish in the Barents and southeast Bering Seas will shift in
response to climate change (high confidence).

supply and the effects of ocean acidification (Sections 28.2.2.2, 28.3.2.1).
Also, areas that are already warm may result in slower growth with
further warming, such as could happen in the northern Scotia Arc

techniques track fishers’ choices based on revenues and costs associated
with targeting a species in a given time and area with a particular gear

target species (Haynie and Pfeiffer, 2012). However, estimates of future

vulnerability analysis suggests that only a few species are expected to
be abundant enough to support viable fisheries in the Arctic Ocean

opilio) on shelf areas of the Arctic Ocean may be limited by the associated
impacts of ocean acidification. If fisheries develop in the Arctic Ocean,
adoption of sustainable strategies for management will be a high
priority (Molenaar, 2009). The moratorium on fishing in the US portion

"By adapting transportation models to integrate monthly climate
model (Community Climate System Model 3 (CCSM3)) predictions of
air temperature—combined with data sets on land cover, topography,
hydrography, built infrastructure, and locations of human settlements—
estimates have been made of changes to inland accessibility for
landscapes northward of 40°N by the mid-21st century (Stephenson et
al., 2011). Milder air temperatures and/or increased snowfall reduce
the possibilities for constructing inland winter-road networks, including
ice roads, with the major seasonal reductions in road potential (based
on a 2000-kg vehicle) being in the winter shoulder-season months of
November and April. The average decline (compared to a baseline of
2000-2014) for eight circumpolar countries was projected to be
-14%, varying from —11 to -82%. In absolute terms, Canada and Russia
(both at -13%) account for the majority of declining winter-road
potential with approximately 1 x 10° km? being lost (see Table 28-1).

"Climate change is likely to have positive impacts for agriculture,
including extended growing season (medium to high confidence;
Falloon and Betts, 2009; Gronlund, 2009; Tholstrup and Rasmussen,
2009), although variations across regions are expected (Hovelsrud et
al., 2011), and the importance of impacts to the Arctic economy will
likely remain minor (Eskeland and Flottorp, 2006). Potential positive
effects of climatic warming for forestry include decreased risk of snow
damage. Kilpelainen et al. (2010) estimate a 50% decrease in snow
damage in Finland toward the end of the century. A warmer climate is
likely to impact access conditions and plant diseases for forestry and
farming. Gronlund (2009) found in the case of northern Norway—
where about half of the arable land area is covered by forest and 40%
by marshland—that the potential harnessing of arable land for farming
will be at the cost of forestry production, or dried-up marshlands, which
may contribute to more greenhouse emissions. Larger field areas may
contribute to land erosion through rainfall and predicted unstable
winters, and may increase conditions for plant diseases and fungal
infections (Gronlund, 2009). If the winter season continues to shorten
due to climate change (Xu et al., 2013), accessibility to logging sites
will be negatively affected. Accessibility is higher when frozen ground
makes transportation possible in sensitive locations or areas that lack
road. If weather changes occur when logging has taken place, sanding
of roads may be necessary which carries significant economic costs.
Impact on carrying capacity of ground or road accessibility will thus
affect forestry economically. Challenges may include limited storage
space for wood (Keskitalo, 2008).

climate on Arctic marine transportation (Prowse et al., 2009). Reduction
in sea ice and increased marine traffic could offer opportunities for
economic diversification in new service sectors supporting marine
shipping. Loss of sea ice may open up waterways and opportunities for
increased cruise traffic (e.g., Glomsred and Aslaksen, 2009), and add to
an already rapid increase in cruise tourism (Howell et al., 2007; Stewart

"The lack of local scale climate projections, combined with uncertainties
in future economic, social, and technological developments, often act
as barriers to adaptation. These barriers, together with other societal
determinants such as ethics, cultures, and attitudes toward risk, may
cause inaction (Adger et al., 2009; West and Hovelsrud, 2010). Resolving
divergent values across and within different communities poses a
challenge for governance regimes. A determining factor in building
adaptive capacity is the flexibility of enabling institutions to develop
robust options (Forbes et al., 2009; Keskitalo et al, 2009; Hovelsrud and

"The adaptive capacity of Arctic Indigenous peoples is largely due to an
extensive traditional knowledge and cultural repertoire, and flexible
social networks (medium confidence; Williams and Hardison, 2013; see
Section 12.3). The dynamic nature of traditional knowledge is valuable
for adapting to current conditions (Kitti et al, 2006; Tyler et al., 2007; Eira

(Ford et al, 2007). In addition, cultural values such as sharing, patience,
persistence, calmness, and respect for elders and the environment are
important. Some studies suggest that traditional knowledge may not
always be sufficient to meet the rapid changes in climate (see Chapter
12) and it may be perceived to be less reliable because the changing
conditions are beyond the current knowledge range (Ingram et al., 2002;

"Examples of Indigenous adaptation strategies have included changing
resource bases; shifting land use and/or settlement areas; combining
technologies with traditional knowledge; changing timing and location
of hunting, gathering, herding, and fishing areas; and improving
communications and education (Galloway-McLean, 2010). Protection
of grazing land will be the most important adaptive strategy for reindeer

more supplies when hunting, constructing permanent shelters on land
as refuges from storms, improved communications infrastructure, greater
use of global positioning systems (GPS) for navigation, synthetic aperture
radar (SAR) to provide estimates of sea ice conditions (Laidler et al.,

"Sea ice is a dominant feature of polar oceans. Shifts in the distribution and extent of sea ice during the growing
season impacts the duration, magnitude, and species composition of primary and secondary production in the polar
regions. With less sea ice many marine ecosystems will experience more light, which can accelerate the growth of
phytoplankton, and shift the balance between the primary production by ice algae and water-borne phytoplankton,
with implications for Arctic food webs. In contrast, sea ice is also an important habitat for juvenile Antarctic krill,
providing food and protection from predators. Krill is a basic food source for many species in polar marine ecosystems.

"Changes in sea ice will have other impacts, beyond these “bottom-up” consequences for marine food webs. Mammals
and birds utilize sea ice as haul-outs during foraging trips (seals, walrus, and polar bears in the Arctic and seals and
penguins in the Antarctic). Some seals (e.g., bearded seals in the Arctic and crab eater and leopard seals in the
Antarctic) give birth and nurse pups in pack ice. Shifts in the spatial distribution and extent of sea ice will alter the
spatial overlap of predators and their prey. According to model projections, within 50 to 70 years, loss of hunting
habitats may lead to elimination of polar bears from seasonally ice-covered areas, where two-thirds of their world
population currently live. The vulnerability of marine species to changes in sea ice will depend on the exposure to
change, which will vary by location, as well as the sensitivity of the species to changing environmental conditions
and the adaptive capacity of each species. More open waters and longer ice-free periods in the northern seas enhance
the effect of wave action and coastal erosion, with implications for coastal communities and infrastructure.

"	Title
"Small islands do not have uniform climate change risk profiles (high confidence). Rather, their high diversity in both physical and
human attributes and their response to climate-related drivers means that climate change impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation will be variable
from one island region to another and between countries in the same region. {Figure 29-1; Table 29-3} In the past, this diversity in potential
response has not always been adequately integrated in adaptation planning.

activities, such as disaster risk reduction and community-based approaches to development (medium confidence). {29.6.4}

"Given the inherent physical characteristics of small islands, the AR5 reconfirms the high level of vulnerability of small islands to
multiple stressors, both climate and non-climate (high confidence; robust evidence, high agreement). However, the distinction
between observed and projected impacts of climate change is often not clear in the literature on small islands (high agreement). {29.3} There is
evidence that this challenge can be partly overcome through improvements in baseline monitoring of island systems and downscaling of climate-
model projections, which would heighten confidence in assessing recent and projected impacts. {WGI AR5 9.6; 29.3-4, 29.9}

"There is increasing recognition of the risks to small islands from climate-related processes originating well beyond the borders

of an individual nation or island. Such transboundary processes already have a negative impact on small islands (high confidence; robust

evidence, medium agreement). These include air-borne dust from the Sahara and Asia, distant-source ocean swells from mid to high latitudes,
invasive plant and animal species, and the spread of aquatic pathogens. For island communities the risks associated with existing and future

invasive species and human health challenges are projected to increase in a changing climate. {29.5.4}

"\daptation and mitigation on small islands are not always trade-offs, but can be regarded as complementary components in the
esponse to climate change (medium confidence). Examples of adaptation-mitigation interlinkages in small islands include energy suppl
ind use, tourism infrastructure and activities, and functions and services associated with coastal wetlands. The alignment of these sectors for
otential emission reductions, together with adaptation, offer co-benefits and opportunities in some small islands. {29.7.2, 29.8} Lessons
earned from adaptation and mitigation experiences in one island may offer some guidance to other small island states, though there is ow
‘onfidence in the success of wholesale transfer of adaptation and mitigation options when the local lenses through which they are viewed

events (e.g., swell waves, storm surges, El Nifio-Southern Oscillation) present severe sea flood and erosion risks for low-lying coastal areas and
atoll islands (high confidence). Likewise, there is high confidence that wave over-wash of seawater will degrade fresh groundwater resources
{29.3.2} and that sea surface temperature rise will result in increased coral bleaching and reef degradation. {29.3.1.2} Given the dependence o
island communities on coral reef ecosystems for a range of services including coastal protection, subsistence fisheries, and tourism, there is
high confidence that coral reef ecosystem degradation will negatively impact island communities and livelihoods.

"The ability of small islands to undertake adaptation and mitigation programs, and their effectiveness, can be substantially
strengthened through appropriate assistance from the international community (medium confidence). However, caution is needed
to ensure such assistance is not driving the climate change agenda in small islands, as there is a risk that critical challenges confronting island
governments and communities may not be addressed. Opportunities for effective adaptation can be found by, for example, empowering
communities and optimizing the benefits of local practices that have proven to be efficacious through time, and working synergistically to
progress development agendas. {29.6.2.3, 29.6.3, 29.8}

"The small islands considered in this chapter are principally sovereign

"Until the AR4 in 2007, SLR had dominated vulnerability and impact
studies of small island states. Whilst a broader range of climate change
drivers and geographical spread of islands was included in the “Small
Islands” chapter, Mimura et al. (2007) prefaced their assessment by
noting that the number of “independent scientific studies on climate
change and small islands since the TAR” had been quite limited and in
their view “the volume of literature in refereed international journals
relating to small islands and climate change since publication of the
TAR is rather less than that between the SAR in 1995 and TAR in 2001""
(Mimura et al., 2007, p. 690).

"It has long been recognized that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from
small islands are negligible in relation to global emissions, but that the
threats of climate change and sea level rise (SLR) to small islands are
very real. Indeed, it has been suggested that the very existence of some
atoll nations is threatened by rising sea levels associated with global
warming. Although such scenarios are not applicable to all small island
nations, there is no doubt that on the whole the impacts of climate
change on small islands will have serious negative effects especially on
socioeconomic conditions and biophysical resources—although impacts
may be reduced through effective adaptation measures.

"Since AR4, the literature on small islands and climate change has
increased substantially. A number of features distinguish the literature
we review here from that included in earlier assessments. First, the
literature appears more sophisticated and does not shirk from dealing
with the complexity of small island vulnerability, impacts, and adaptation
or the differences between islands and island states. Second, and related
to the first, the literature is less one-dimensional, and deals with climate
change in a multidimensional manner as just one of several stressors
on small island nations. Third, the literature also critiques some aspects
of climate change policy, notably in relation to critical present-day

"The Third Assessment Report (TAR) in 2001 included a specific chapter
on ""Small Island States.” In confirming previously identified concerns
of small island states two factors were highlighted, the first relating to
sustainability, noting that “with limited resources and low adaptive
capacity, these islands face the considerable challenge of meeting the
social and economic needs of their populations in a manner that is
sustainable” (Nurse et al., 2001, p. 845). The second noted that there
were other issues faced by small island states, concluding that “for most
small islands the reality of climate change is just one of many serious
challenges with which they are confronted” (Nurse et al., 2001, p. 846).
In the present chapter, both of these themes are raised again and
assessed in light of recent findings.
"	Text
"Although these small islands nations are by no means homogeneous
politically, socially, or culturally, or in terms of physical size and character
or economic development, there has been a tendency to generalize
about the potential impacts on small islands and their adaptive capacity.
In this chapter we attempt to strike a balance between identifying the
differences between small islands and at the same time recognizing
that small islands tend to share a number of common characteristics
that have distinguished them as a particular group in international
affairs. Also in this chapter we reiterate some of the frequently voiced
and key concerns relating to climate change impacts, vulnerability, and
adaptation while emphasizing a number of additional themes that
have emerged in the literature on small islands since the IPCC Fourth
Assessment Report (AR4). These include the relationship among climate
change policy, activities, and development issues; externally generated
transboundary impacts; and the implications of risk in relation to
adaptation and the adaptive capacity of small island nations.
"	Text
"Small islands were not given a separate chapter in the IPCC First
Assessment Report (FAR) in 1990 though they were discussed in the
chapter on “World Oceans and Coastal Zones” (Tsyban et al., 1990).
Two points were highlighted. First, a 30- to 50-cm SLR projected by 2050
would threaten low islands, and a 1-m rise by 2100 “would render some
island countries uninhabitable"" (Tegart et al., 1990, p. 4). Second, the
costs of protection works to combat SLR would be extremely high for
small island nations. Indeed, as a percentage of gross domestic product
(GDP), the Maldives, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Tokelau, Anguilla, Turks and Caicos,
Marshall Islands, and Seychelles were ranked among the 10 nations
with the highest protection costs in relation to GDP (Tsyban et al., 1990).
More than 20 years later these two points continue to be emphasized.
For instance, although small islands represent only a fraction of total
global damage projected to occur as a result of a SLR of 1.0 m by 2100
(Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A1 scenario) the actual
damage costs for the small island states is enormous in relation to the
size of their economies, with several small island nations being included
"	Text
"The Second Assessment Report (SAR) in 1995 confirmed the vulnerable
state of small islands, now included in a specific chapter titled “Coastal
Zones and Small Islands” (Bijlsma et al, 1996). However, importantly,
the SAR recognized that both vulnerability and impacts would be highly
variable between small islands and that impacts were “likely to be
greatest where local environments are already under stress as a result
of human activities” (Bijlsma et al., 1996, p. 291). The report also
summarized results from the application of a common methodology for
vulnerability and adaptation analysis that gave new insights into the
socioeconomic implications of SLR for small islands including: negative
impacts on virtually all sectors including tourism, freshwater resources,
fisheries and agriculture, human settlements, financial services, and
human health; protection is likely to be very costly; and adaptation
would involve a series of trade-offs. It also noted that major constraints
to adaptation on small islands included lack of technology and human
resource capacity, serious financial limitations, lack of cultural and social
acceptability, and uncertain political and legal frameworks. Integrated
coastal and island management was seen as a way of overcoming some
of these constraints.

"The distinction between observed impacts of climate change and projected
impacts is often unclear in the small islands literature and discussions.
Publications frequently deal with both aspects of impacts interchangeably,
and use observed impacts from, for instance an extreme event, as an
analogy to what may happen in the future as a result of climate change
(e.g., Lo-Yat et al, 2011). The key climate and ocean drivers of change
that impact small islands include variations in air and ocean temperatures;
ocean chemistry; rainfall; wind strength and direction; sea levels and
wave climate; and particularly the extremes such as tropical cyclones,
drought, and distant storm swell events. All have varying impacts,
dependent on the magnitude, frequency, and temporal and spatial
extent of the event, as well as on the biophysical nature of the island

"2010; Church and White, 2011). This is particularly important in small
islands where the majority of human communities and infrastructure is
located in coastal zones with limited on-island relocation opportunities,
especially on atoll islands (Woodroffe, 2008) (Figure 29-1). Over much of
the 20th century, global mean sea level rose at a rate between 1.3 and
1.7 mm yr"" and since 1993, at a rate between 2.8 and 3.6 mm yr""
(WGI ARS Table 13.1), and acceleration is detected in longer records
since 1870 (Merrifield et al., 2009; Church and White, 2011; see also
WGI ARS Section 13.2.2.1). Rates of SLR, however, are not uniform
across the globe and large regional differences have been detected
including in the Indian Ocean and tropical Pacific, where in some parts
rates have been significantly higher than the global average (Meyssignac
et al., 2012; see also Section 5.3.2.2). In the tropical western Pacific,
where a large number of small island communities exist, rates up to
four times the global average (approximately 12 mm yr-') have been
reported between 1993 and 2009. These are generally thought to describe
short-term variations associated with natural cyclic climate phenomena
such as El Nifio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which has a strong
modulating effect on sea level variability with lower/higher-than-average
sea level during El Nifio/La Nifia events of the order of +20 to 30 cm
(Cazenave and Remy, 2011; Becker et al., 2012). Large interannual
variability in sea level has also been demonstrated from the Indian
Ocean (e.g., Chagos Archipelago; Dunne et al., 2012) while Palanisamy
et al. (2012) found that over the last 60 years the mean rate of SLR in
the Caribbean region was similar to the global average of approximately
1.8mm yr.

"Since the AR4 a number of empirical studies have documented historical
changes in island shorelines. Historical shoreline position change over
20 to 60 years on 27 central Pacific atoll islands showed that total land
area remained relatively stable in 43% of islands, while another 43%
had increased in area, and the rest showed a net reduction in land area
(Webb and Kench, 2010). Dynamic responses were also found in a 4-
year study of 17 relatively pristine islands on two other central Pacific
atolls in Kiribati by Rankey (2011), who concluded that SLR was not
likely to be the main influencing factor in these shoreline changes.

impacts on shoreline processes present immediate erosion challenges

attribution to SLR. A study of Majuro atoll (Marshall Islands) found that
erosion was widespread but attribution to SLR was obscured by pervasive
anthropogenic impacts to the coastal system (Ford, 2012; see Section
5.4.4). Similarly a study of three islands in the Rosario Archipelago
(Colombia) reported shoreline retreat over a 50- to 55-year period and

"In the last 2 or 3 decades many small islands have undergone substantial changes in human settlement patterns
and in socioeconomic and environmental conditions. Those changes may have masked any clear evidence of the
effects of climate change. For example, on many small islands coastal erosion has been widespread and has adversely
affected important tourist facilities, settlements, utilities, and infrastructure. But specific case studies from islands
in the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans and the Caribbean have shown that human impacts play an important
role in this erosion, as do episodic extreme events that have long been part of the natural cycle of events affecting
small islands. So although coastal erosion is consistent with models of sea level rise resulting from climate change,
determining just how much of this erosion might have been caused by climate change impacts is difficult. Given
the range of natural processes and human activities that could impact the coasts of small islands in the future,
without more and better empirical monitoring the role of climate change-related processes on small islands may
continue to be difficult to identify and quantify.

"Documented cases of coastal inundation and erosion often cite additional
circumstances such as vertical subsidence, engineering works, development
activities, or beach mining as the causal process. Four examples can be
cited. First, on the Torres Islands, Vanuatu communities have been displaced
as a result of increasing inundation of low-lying settlement areas owing
to a combination of tectonic subsidence and SLR (Ballu et al., 2011).
Second, on Anjouan Island, Comores in the Indian Ocean, Sinane et al.
(2010) found beach aggregate mining was a major contributing factor
influencing rapid beach erosion. Third, the intrinsic exposure of rapidly
expanding settlements and agriculture in the low-lying flood prone
Rewa Delta, Fiji, is shown by Lata and Nunn (2012) to place populations
in increasingly severe conditions of vulnerability to flooding and marine
inundation. Fourth, Hoeke et al. (2013) describe a 2008 widespread
inundation event that displaced some 63,000 people in Papua New
Guinea and Solomon Islands alone. That event was caused primarily by
remotely generated swell waves, and the severity of flooding was
greatly increased by anomalously high regional sea levels linked with
ENSO and ongoing SLR. Such examples serve to highlight that extreme
events superimposed on a rising sea level baseline are the main drivers
that threaten the habitability of low-lying islands as sea levels continue
to rise.

"Similarly in French Polynesia, Yates et al. (2013) showed mixed shoreline
change patterns over the last 40 to 50 years with examples of both
erosion and accretion in the 47 atoll islands assessed. SLR did not
appear to be the primary control on shoreline processes on these islands.
On uninhabited Raine Island on the Great Barrier Reef, Dawson and
Smithers (2010) also found that shoreline processes were dynamic but
that island area and volume increased 6 and 4%, respectively, between
1967 and 2007. Overall, these studies of observed shoreline change on
reef islands conclude that for rates of change experienced over recent
decades, normal seasonal erosion and accretion processes appear to
predominate over any long-term morphological trend or signal at this
time. Ford's (2013) investigation of Wotje Atoll, Marshall Islands, also
found shoreline variability between 1945 and 2010 but that overall
accretion had been more prevalent than erosion up until 2004. From
2004 to the present, 17 out of 18 islands became net erosive, potentially
corresponding to the high sea levels in the region over the last 10 years.
On the high tropical islands of Kauai and Maui, Hawaii, Romine and
Fletcher (2013) found shoreline change was highly variable over the
last century but that recently chronic erosion predominated with over
70% of beaches now being erosive. Finally, it is important to note the
majority of these studies warn that (1) past changes cannot be simply
extrapolated to determine future shoreline responses; and (2) rising sea
level will incrementally increase the rate and extent of erosion in the
future.

on which many island communities are dependent for subsistence foods

Guinea, 65% of coastal fish are dependent on living reefs at some stage
in their life cycle and there is evidence that fish abundance declined
following degradation of the reef (Jones et al., 2004). Even where coral
reef recovery has followed bleaching, reef-associated species composition
may not recover to its original state (Pratchett et al., 2009; Donner et al.,

with a lag in the larval supply of coral reef fishes, as reported by Lo-Yat

reefs show greater resilience than others. There is also some evidence
to show that coral reef resilience is enhanced in the absence of other
environmental stresses such as declining water quality. In Belize
chronologies of growth rates in massive corals (Montastraea faveolata)
over the past 75 to 150 years suggest that the bleaching event in 1998
was unprecedented and its severity appeared to stem from reduced
thermal tolerance related to human coastal development (Carilli et al.,
2010). Likewise a study over a 40-year period (1960s—2008) in the
Grand Recif of Tulear, Madagascar, concluded that severe degradation
of the reef was mostly ascribed to direct anthropogenic disturbance,
despite an average 1°C increase in temperature over this period (Harris

central Pacific atolls of Tarawa and Abaiang (Kiribati) was also noted to

"Increased coral bleaching and reduced reef calcification rates due to
thermal stress and increasing carbon dioxide (CO,) concentration are
expected to affect the functioning and viability of living reef systems
(Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007; Eakin et al., 2009). Some studies already
implicate thermal stress in reduced coral calcification rates (Tanzil et
al., 2009) and regional declines in calcification of corals that form reef
framework (De‘ath et al., 2009; Cantin et al., 2010). Unprecedented
bleaching events have been recorded in the remote Phoenix Islands
(Kiribati), with nearly 100% coral mortality in the lagoon and 62%
mortality on the outer leeward slopes of the otherwise pristine reefs of
Kanton Atoll during 2002-2003 (Alling et al., 2007). Similar patterns of
mortality were observed in four other atolls in the Phoenix group and
temperature-induced coral bleaching was also recorded in isolated
Palmyra Atoll during the 2009 ENSO event (Williams et al., 2010). In
2005 extensive bleaching was recorded at 22 sites around Rodrigues
Island in the western Indian Ocean, with up to 75% of the dominant
species affected in some areas (Hardman et al., 2007). Studies of the
severe 1998 El Nifio bleaching event in the tropical Indian Ocean
showed reefs in the Maldives, Seychelles, and Chagos Islands were
among the most impacted (Cinner et al., 2012; Tkachenko, 2012). In
2005 a reef survey around Barbados following a Caribbean regional
bleaching event revealed the most severe bleaching ever recorded, with
approximately 70% of corals impacted (Oxenford et al., 2008). Globally,
the incidence and implications of temperature-related coral bleaching
in small islands is well documented, and combined with the effects of
increasing ocean acidification these stressors could threaten the

surface runoff is minimal and water rapidly passes through the substrate

variable, and manifest in quite different ways. A study of seven species

variability in response to heat and light stress (Campbell et al., 2006).
Light reduction may be a limiting factor to seagrass growth due to
increased water depth and sedimentation (Ralph et al., 2007). Ogston
and Field (2010) observed that a 20-cm rise in sea level may double the
suspended sediment loads and turbidity in shallow waters on fringing

on seagrass (e.g., Campbell et al., 2006; Waycott et al., 2011). Literature
on seagrass diebacks in small islands is scarce but research in the
Balearic Islands (Western Mediterranean) has shown that over a 6-year

"Increasing global temperatures may also lead to altitudinal species
range shifts and contractions within high islands, with an upward creep
of the tree line and associated fauna (Benning et al., 2002; Krushelnycky

island of Taiwan, Province of China, historical survey and resurvey data
from 1906 to 2006 showed that the upper altitudinal limits of plant
distributions had risen by about 3.6 m yr during the last century in
parallel with rising temperatures in the region (Jump et al., 2012).
Comparable effects also occur in the tropics such as in Hawaii Volcano
National Park, where comparison of sample plots over a 40-year period
from 1966/1967 to 2008 show fire-adapted grasses expanded upward
along a warming tropical elevation gradient (Angelo and Daehler, 2013).
Reduction in the numbers and sizes of endemic populations caused by
such habitat constriction and changes in species composition in mountain
systems may result in the demise and possibly extinction of endemic
species (Pauli et al, 2007; Chen et al., 2009; Sekercioglu et al., 2008;

"Climate change impacts on terrestrial biodiversity on islands, frequently
interacting with several other drivers (Blackburn et al., 2004; Didham

and species horizontal shifts and range decline; (2) altitudinal species
range shifts and decline mainly due to temperature increase on high
islands; and (3) exotic and pest species range increase and invasions
mainly due to temperature increase in high-latitude islands. Owing to
the limited area and isolated nature of most islands, these effects are
generally magnified compared to continental areas and may cause
species loss, especially in tropical islands with high numbers of endemic
species. For example, in two low-lying islands in the Bahamas, Greaver
and Sternberg (2010) found that during periods of reduced rainfall the
shallow freshwater lens subsides and contracts landward and ocean
water infiltrates further inland, negatively impacting on coastal strand
vegetation. SLR has also been observed to threaten the long-term
persistence of freshwater-dependent ecosystems within low-lying
islands in the Florida Keys (Goodman et al., 2012). On Sugarloaf Key,
Ross et al. (2009) found pine forest area declined from 88 to 30 ha from
1935 to 1991 due to increasing salinization and rising groundwater,
with vegetation transitioning to more saline-tolerant species such as

"While traditional settlements on high islands in the Pacific were often
located inland, the move to coastal locations was encouraged by colonial

tourism (Barnett and Campbell, 2010). Now the majority of settlement,
infrastructure, and development are located on lowlands along the
coastal fringe of small islands. In the case of atoll islands, all development
and settlement is essentially coastal. It follows that populations,
infrastructure, agricultural areas, and fresh groundwater supplies are
all vulnerable to extreme tides, wave and surge events, and SLR (Walsh
et al., 2012). Population drift from outer islands or from inland, together
with rapid population growth in main centers and lack of accommodation
space, drives growing populations into ever more vulnerable locations
(Connell, 2012). In addition, without adequate resources and planning,

traditional settlement patterns has resulted in movement from less

Tuvalu, show that engineering works during World War II, and rapid
development and population growth since independence, have led to
the settlement of inappropriate shoreline and swampland areas, leaving
communities in heightened conditions of vulnerability (e.g., Yamano et
al., 2007). Ascribing direct climate change impacts in such disturbed
environments is problematic owing to the existing multiple lines of
stress on the island's biophysical and social systems. However, it is clear
that such preexisting conditions of vulnerability add to the threat of
climate change in such locations. Increased risk can also result from
lack of awareness, particularly in communities in rural areas and outer
islands (""periphery"") of archipelagic countries such as Cook Islands, Fiji,
Kiribati, and Vanuatu, whose climate change knowledge often contrasts
sharply with that of communities in the major centers (“core”). In the

"There is a paucity of empirical evidence linking saline (seawater) intrusion
into fresh groundwater reserves due simply to incremental SLR at this

subject of improved research given the importance of groundwater
aquifers in small island environments. White and Falkland’s (2010)
review of existing small island studies indicates that a sea level increase
of up to 1 m would have negligible salinity impacts on atoll island
groundwater lenses so long as there is adequate vertical accommodation
space, island shores remain intact, rainfall patterns do not change, and
direct human impacts are managed. However, wave overtopping and
wash-over can be expected to become more frequent with SLR, and this
has been shown to impact freshwater lenses dramatically. On Pukapuka
Atoll, Cook Islands, storm surge over-wash occurred in 2005. This caused
the freshwater lenses to become immediately brackish and took 11
months to recover to conductivity levels appropriate for human use
(Terry and Falkland, 2010). The ability of the freshwater lens to float
upward within the substrate of an island in step with incremental SLR
also means that in low-lying and central areas of many atoll islands the
lens may pond at the surface. This phenomenon already occurs in central
areas of Fongafale Island, Tuvalu, and during extreme high “king” tides
large areas of the inner part of the island become inundated with
brackish waters (Yamano et al., 2007; Locke, 2009).

degradation challenges such as beach erosion and coral bleaching
have been found to negatively impact the perception of destination
attractiveness in various locations, for example, in Martinique (Schleupner,

tourists are well aware of coral bleaching, particularly the experienced

acute impacts are felt by tourism operators and resorts that cater to
these markets. Houston (2002) and Buzinde et al. (2010) also indicate
that beach erosion may similarly affect accommodation prices in some

variety of resource restoration initiatives including artificial beach
nourishment, coral and mangrove restoration, and the establishment
of marine parks and protected areas (McClanahan et al., 2008; Mycoo

investments are or their capability to cope effectively with future climate

consider the climate risk of tourism operations (Scott et al., 2012b),
including those associated with the availability of freshwater. Freshwater
is limited on many small islands, and changes in its availability or quality
during drought events linked to climate change have adverse impacts
on tourism operations (UNWTO, 2012). Tourism is a seasonally significant
water user in many island destinations, and in times of drought concerns
over limited supply for residents and other economic activities become
heightened (Géssling et al., 2012b). The increasing use of desalination

in infrastructural outlays. This is of major relevance to climate change
adaptation that often requires upgrades and redesign of island

associated with purchases of raw materials and industrial supplies in
small quantities, and sales of local produced products to distant
markets. These disadvantages are associated with the inability of small
islands to reap the benefits of economies of scale, resulting in a high
cost of doing business in small islands (Winters and Martins, 2004).

"Evidence of human migration as a response to climate change is scarce
for small islands. Although there is general agreement that migration
is usually driven by multiple factors (Black et al., 2011), several authors
highlight the lack of empirical studies of the effect of climate-related
factors, such as SLR, on island migration (Mortreux and Barnett, 2009;
Lilleor and Van den Broeck, 2011). Furthermore, there is no evidence of
any government policy that allows for climate “refugees” from islands
to be accepted into another country (Bedford and Bedford, 2010). This
finding contrasts with the early desk-based estimates of migration
under climate change such as the work of Myers (2002). These early
studies have been criticized as they fail to acknowledge the reality of
climate impacts on islands, the capacity of islands and islanders to
adapt, or the actual drivers of migration (Barnett and O'Neill, 2012).

"The economic and environmental vulnerabilities of small islands states are
well documented (Briguglio et al, 2009, Bishop, 2012). Such vulnerabilities,
which render the states at risk of being harmed by economic and
environmental conditions, stem from intrinsic features of these vulnerable
states, and are not usually governance induced. However, governance
does remain one of the challenges for island countries in the Pacific in the
pursuit of sustainable development through economic growth (Prasad,
2008). Economic vulnerability is often the result of a high degree of
exposure to economic conditions often outside the control of small island
states, exacerbated by dependence on a narrow range of exports and a
high degree of dependence on strategic imports, such as food and fuel
(Briguglio et al., 2009). This leads to economic volatility, a condition
that is harmful for the economy of the islands (Guillaumont, 2010).

"Studies of island migration commonly reveal the complexity of a decision
to migrate and rarely identify a single cause. For example, when looking
at historical process of migration within the Mediterranean, it appears
that rising levels of income, coupled with a decreased dependence on
subsistence agriculture, has left the Mediterranean less vulnerable to
all environmental stressors, resulting in a reduced need for mobility to
cope with environmental or climatic change (de Haas, 2011). Studies
from the Pacific have also shown that culture, lifestyle, and a connection
to place are more significant drivers of migration than climate (Barnett
and Webber, 2010). For example, a Pacific Access Category of migration
has been agreed between New Zealand and Tuvalu that permits 75
Tuvaluans to migrate to New Zealand every year (Kravchenko, 2008).
Instead of enabling climate-driven migration, this agreement is designed
to facilitate economic and social migration as part of the Pacific Island

"There is, however, some evidence that environmental change has played
a role in Pacific Island migration in the past (Nunn, 2007). In the Pacific,
environmental change has been shown to affect land use and land rights,
which in turn have become drivers of migration (Bedford and Bedford,
2010). In a survey of 86 case studies of community relocations in Pacific
Islands, Campbell et al. (2005) found that environmental variability and
natural hazards accounted for 37 communities relocating. In the Pacific,
where land rights are a source of conflict, climate change could increase
levels of stress associated with land rights and impact on migration
(Campbell, 2010; Weir and Virani, 2011). Although there is not yet a
climate fingerprint on migration and resettlement patterns in all small
islands, it is clear that there is the potential for human movement as a
response to climate change. To understand better the impact of climate
change on migration there is an urgent need for robust methods to
identify and measure the effects of the drivers of migration on migration
and resettlement.

development is well established (Chaves and Koenraadt, 2010; Béguin

climate change on malaria, using deterministic or statistical models
(Martens et al., 1999; Pascual et al., 2006; Hay et al., 2009; Parham and
Michael, 2010). Although the present incidence of malaria on small
islands is not reported to be high, favorable environmental and social
circumstances for the spread of the disease are present in some island
regions and are expected to be enhanced under projected changes in
climate in Papua New Guinea, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guyana
(Michon et al., 2007; Figueroa, 2008; Rawlins et al., 2008). In the
Caribbean, the occurrence of autochthonous malaria in non-endemic
island countries in the last 10 years suggests that all of the essential
malaria transmission conditions now exist. Rawlins et al. (2008) call for
enhanced surveillance, recognizing the possible impact of climate

"Small islands face many challenges in using climate change projections

these is the inaction inherent in the mismatch of the short-term time
scale on which government decisions are generally taken compared
with the long-term time scale required for decisions related to climate

"of the climate signal from the vulnerability associated with socioeconomic
conditions and governance. There is, however, a problem in generating
formal climate scenarios at the scale of small islands because they are
generally much smaller than the resolution of the global climate models.
This is because the grid squares in the Global Circulation Models (GCMs)
used in the SRES scenarios over the last decade were between 200 and
600 km?, which provides inadequate resolution over the land areas of most
small islands. This has recently improved with the new Representative
Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenario GCMs with grid boxes generally
between 100 and 200 km? in size.

"While exceptional vulnerability of many small islands to future climate
change is widely accepted, the foregoing analysis indicates that the
scientific literature on observed impacts is quite limited. Detection of past
and recent climate change impacts is challenging owing to the presence
of other anthropogenic drivers, especially in the constrained environments
of small islands. Attribution is further challenged by the strong influence
of natural climate variability compared to gradual incremental change
of climate drivers. Notwithstanding these limitations, a summary of the
relationship between detection and attribution to climate change of
several of the phenomena described in the preceding sections has been
prepared. Figure 29-2 reflects the degree of confidence in the link between
observed changes in several components of the coastal, terrestrial, and
human systems of small islands and the drivers of climate change.

"The scale problem has been usually addressed by the implementation
of statistical downscaling models that relate GCM output to the historical
climate of a local small island data point. The limitation of this approach
is the need for observed data ideally for at least 3 decades for a number
of representative points on the island, in order to establish the statistical
relationships between GCM data and observations. In most small
islands long-term quality-controlled climate data are generally sparse,
so that in widely dispersed islands such as in the Pacific, observational
records are usually supplemented with satellite observations combined
with dynamical downscaling computer models (Australian Bureau of
Meteorology and CSIRO, 2011a; Keener et al., 2012). However, where
adequate local data are available for several stations for at least 30
years, downscaling techniques have demonstrated that they can provide
projections at fine scales ranging from about 10 to 25 km? (e.g., Charlery
and Nurse, 2010; Australian Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO, 201 1a).
Even so, most projected changes in climate for the Caribbean Sea,
Pacific and Indian Oceans, and Mediterranean islands generally apply to
the region as a whole, and this may be adequate to determine general
trends in regions where islands are close together.
"	Text
"Adaptation to climate change that involves infrastructural works generally requires large up-front overhead costs,
which in the case of small islands cannot be easily downscaled in proportion to the size of the population or territory.
This is a major socioeconomic reality that confronts many small islands, notwithstanding the benefits that could
accrue to island communities through adaptation. Referred to as “indivisibility” in economics, the problem can be
illustrated by the cost of shore protection works aimed at reducing the impact of sea level rise. The unit cost of
shoreline protection per capita in small islands is substantially higher than the unit cost for a similar structure in a
larger territory with a larger population. This scale-reality applies throughout much of a small island economy
including the indivisibility of public utilities, services, and all forms of development. Moreover, the relative impact
of an extreme event such as a tropical cyclone that can affect most of a small island’s territory has a disproportionate
impact on that state’s gross domestic product, compared to a larger country where an individual event generally
affects a small proportion of its total territory and its GDP. The result is relatively higher adaptation and disaster risk
reduction costs per capita in countries with small populations and areas—especially those that are also geographically
isolated, have a poor resource base, and have high transport costs.

competitive position and sustainability of coastal tourism destinations

based on six scenarios for SLR from 0.09 to 0.88 m in combination with
six scenarios for storm surge with return intervals from 1 to 50 years
(Gravelle and Mimura, 2008). Another example of qualitative modeling
from the Pacific is a case study from Nauru that uses local data and
knowledge of climate to assess the GCM projections. It suggests that
Nauru should plan for continued ENSO variability in the future with dry
years during La Nifia and an overall increase in mean rainfall and
extreme rainfall events. Climate adaptation concerns that arise include
water security and potential changes in extreme wet events that affect

the AR4 of medium emissions climate scenario projections for small
island regions (Mimura et al., 2007) shows concordance with the new
RCP scenarios (see Table 29-1 and new RCP projections in Figure 29-3).

a 1.8°C to 2.3°C median annual increase in surface temperature in the
Caribbean Sea and Indian and Pacific Ocean small islands regions by
2100 compared to a 1980-1999 baseline, with an overall annual decrease

temperature by 2100 compared to a 1986-2005 baseline and a decrease
in precipitation of about 5 or 6% in the Caribbean and Mediterranean,
respectively, signaling potential future problems for agriculture and

Negotiation and Distribution (FUND) model to assess the economic
impact of substantial SLR in a range of socioeconomic scenarios
downscaled to the national level, including the four SRES storylines

a few regions will experience most of the absolute costs of SLR by 2100,

results when expressed as percent of GDP showed that most of the top
ten and four of the top five most impacted are small islands from the
Pacific (Federated States of Micronesia, Palau, Marshall Islands, Nauru)
and Caribbean (Bahamas). The point is made that the damage costs for
these small island states are enormous in relation to the size of their

they will find it most difficult to locally raise the finances necessary to

"In the Caribbean, downscaled climate projections have been generated
for some islands using the Hadley Centre PRECIS (Providing REgional

regional climate model projects an increase in temperature across the
Caribbean of 1°C to 4°C compared to a 1960-1990 baseline, with
increasing rainfall during the latter part of the wet season from November
to January in the northern Caribbean (i.e., north of 22°N) and drier
conditions in the southern Caribbean linked to changes in the Caribbean
Low Level Jet (CLLJ) with a strong tendency to drying in the traditional
wet season from June to October (Whyte et al., 2008; Campbell et al.,

and increasing frequency of drought are expected to increase demand
for water throughout the region under the SRES A1B scenario (Cashman

the SRES B1 (low), A2 (mid to high), and A1F1 scenarios during
September although increased crop yield is suggested during February

publications providing downscaled climate data projections, and even
less illustrating the experience gained from their use for policy making.
A possible 2°C temperature increase by the year 2100 has potentially
far-reaching consequences for sentinel ecosystems such as coral reefs
that are important to tropical islands (see Section 6.2.2.4.4). This is
because “degree heating months” (DHMs) greater than 2°C per month
are the determining threshold for severe coral bleaching (Donner, 2009).
For example, in a study of SST across all coral reef regions using GCM
ensemble projections forced with five different SRES future emissions
scenarios, Donner (2009) concluded that even warming in the future
from the current accumulation of GHGs in the atmosphere could cause
more than half of the world’s coral reefs to experience harmfully
frequent thermal stress by 2080. Further, this timeline could be brought
forward to as early as 2030 under the A1B medium emissions scenario.
He further stated that thermal adaptation of 1.5°C would delay the
thermal stress forecast by only 50 to 80 years. Donner (2009) also

should be based on Global Mean Surface Temperature (GMST) increase

that for the Caribbean, Indian Ocean, and Pacific SIDS in the tropics, the
median projected regional increase is in the range 0.5°C to 0.9°C by 2100
compared to 1986-2005. This, together with the temperature change that
has already occurred since the Industrial Revolution, suggests that a
temperature “well below” 1.5°C is unlikely to be achieved with the lowest
RCP2.6 projection (Peters et al., 2013). By comparison, temperature
projections for the intermediate low RCP4.5 scenario (Table 29-1; Figure

increase compared to pre-industrial temperatures. Associated with
this change, the Caribbean and Mediterranean regions may experience
a noticeable decrease in mean rainfall while the Indian and Pacific

different from the tropical Pacific RCP4.5 projections, with projected
temperature increases of about +1.2 to 1.4°C by 2100 and an increase
in rainfall of about 4% (Table 29-1). A comprehensive assessment of
the vulnerability of the fisheries and aquaculture sectors to climate
change in 22 Pacific island countries and territories focused on two
future time frames (2035 and 2100) and two SRES emissions scenarios,
B1 (low emissions) and A2 (high emissions) (Bell et al., 2013). Many
anticipated changes in habitat and resource availability such as coral
reef-based fisheries are negative. By contrast, projected changes in tuna
fisheries and freshwater aquaculture/fisheries can be positive with
implications for government revenue and island food security (Bell et
al., 2013). Simulation studies on changes in stocks of skipjack and
bigeye tuna in the tropical Pacific area summarized in Table 29-2 and
also discussed in Sections 7.4.2.1 and 30.6.2.1.1. Some of these
projected changes may favor the large international fishing fleets that
can shift operations over large distances compared to local, artisanal
fishers (Polovina et al., 2011).

"Whereas the origin of the long period ocean swells that impact small
islands in the tropical regions come from the mid- and high latitudes in
the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans, there are also instances of
unusually large waves generated from tropical cyclones that spread into
the mid- and high latitudes. One example occurred during 1999 when
tide gauges at Ascension and St. Helena Islands in the central south
Atlantic recorded unusually large deep-ocean swell generated from
distant Hurricane Irene (Vassie et al., 2004). The impacts of increasing

"Invasive species are colonizer species that establish populations outside
their normal distribution ranges. The spread of invasive alien species
is regarded as a significant transboundary threat to the health of
biodiversity and ecosystems, and has emerged as a major factor in
species decline, extinction, and loss of biodiversity goods and services
worldwide. This is particularly true of islands, where both endemicity

Lopez-Villarrubia et al, 2010). During major events, dust concentrations
can exceed 100 pg m3 (Prospero, 2006). Independent studies using
different methodologies have all found a strong positive correlation
between dust levels in the Caribbean and periods of drought in the
Sahara, while concentrations show a marked decrease during periods
of higher rainfall. Consequently, it is argued that higher dust emissions
due to increasing aridity in the Sahel and other arid areas could enhance
climate change effects over large areas, including the eastern Caribbean
and the Mediterranean (Prospero and Lamb, 2003). Similar findings
have been reported at Cape Verde where dust emission levels were
found to be a factor of nine lower during the decade of the 1950s when
rainfall was at or above normal, compared to the 1980s, a period of
intense drought in the Sahel region (Nicoll et al., 2011). Dust from the

"The movement of aquatic and terrestrial invasive fauna within and across
regions will almost certainly exacerbate the threat posed by climate
change in island regions, and could impose significant environmental,
economic, and social costs. Recent research has shown that the invasion
of the Caribbean Sea by the Indo-Pacific lionfish (Pterois volitans), a
highly efficient and successful predator, is a major contributor to observed
increases in algal dominance in coral and sponge communities in the
Bahamas and elsewhere in the region. The consequential damage to these
ecosystems has been attributed to a significant decline in herbivores due
to predation by lionfish (Albins and Hixon, 2008; Schofield, 2010; Green
et al., 2011; Lesser and Slattery, 2011). Although there is no evidence
that the lionfish invasion is climate-related, the concern is that when
combined with preexisting stress factors the natural resilience of
Caribbean reef communities will decrease (Green et al., 2012; Albins
and Hixon, 2013), making them more susceptible to climate change
effects such as bleaching. Englund (2008) has documented the negative
effects of invasive species on native aquatic insects on Hawaii and
French Polynesia, and their potential role in the extirpation of native
aquatic invertebrates in the Pacific. Similarly, there is evidence that on
the island of Oahu introduced slugs appear to be “skewing species
abundance in favour of certain non-native and native plants,"" by altering
the “rank order of seedling survival rates,” thereby undermining the
ability of preferred species (e.g., the endangered C. superba) to compete

"Islands face risks from both climate-related hazards that have occurred
for centuries, as well as new risks from climate change. There have been
extensive studies of the risks associated with past climate-related
hazards and adaptations to these, such as tropical cyclones, drought,
and disease, and their attendant impacts on human health, tourism,
fisheries, and other areas (Bijlsma et al., 1996; Cronk 1997; Solomon
and Forbes 1999; Pelling and Uitto 2001). There have also been many
studies that have used a variety of vulnerability, risk, and adaptation
assessment methods particularly in the Pacific that have recently been
summarized by Hay et al. (2013). But for most islands, there is very little
published literature documenting the probability, frequency, severity,
or consequences of climate change risks such as SLR, ocean acidification,
and salinization of freshwater resources—or associated adaptation
measures. Projections of future climate change risks are limited by the
lack of model skill in projecting the climatic variables that matter to
small islands, notably tropical cyclone frequency and intensity, wind
speed and direction, precipitation, sea level, ocean temperature, and
ocean acidification (Brown et al., 2013b); inadequate projections of
regional sea levels (Willis and Church, 2012); and a lack of long-term
baseline monitoring of changes in climatic risk, or to ground-truth
models (Voccia, 2012), such as risk of saline intrusion, risk of invasive
species, risk of biodiversity loss, or risk of large ocean waves. In their
absence, qualitative studies have documented perceptions of change
in current risks (Fazey et al., 2011; Lata and Nunn, 2012), reviewed
effective coping mechanisms for current stressors (Bunce et al., 2009;
Campbell et al., 2011) and have considered future scenarios of change
(Weir and Virani, 2011). These studies highlight that change is occurring,
but they do not quantify the probability, speed, scale, or distribution of
future climate risks. The lack of quantitative published assessments of

critical (Forbes et al., 2013).

"To understand climate vulnerability on islands, it is necessary to assess
all of these dimensions of vulnerability (Rasmussen et al., 2011). For
example, with individual ecosystems such as coral reef ecosystems,
those already under stress from non-climate factors are more at risk
from climate change than those that are unstressed (Hughes et al.,
2003; Maina et al., 2011). Evidence is starting to emerge that shows
the same applies at the island scale. In Majuro atoll (Marshall Islands),
34 to 37 years of aerial photography shows that socio-ecological stress
is exacerbating shoreline change associated with SLR, especially on the
lagoon side of islands (Ford, 2012; see also Section 29.3.1.1). Islands
faced with multiple stressors can therefore be assumed to be more at
risk from climate impacts.
"	Text
"Island vulnerability is often a function of four key stressors: physical,
socioeconomic, socio-ecological, and climate-induced, whose reinforcing
mechanisms are important in determining the magnitude of impacts.
Geophysical characteristics of islands (see Table 29-2; Figure 29-1)
create inherent physical vulnerabilities. Thus, for example the Azores
(Portugal) face seismic, landslide, and tsunami risks (Coutinho et al.,
2009). Socioeconomic vulnerabilities are related to ongoing challenges
of managing urbanization, pollution, and sanitation, both in small island
states and non-sovereign islands as highlighted by Storey and Hunter
(2010) in Kiribati, Lopez-Marrero and Yarnal (2010) in Puerto Rico, and
in Mayotte, France (Le Masson and Kelman, 2011). Socio-ecological
stresses, such as habitat loss and degradation, invasive species
(described in Sax and Gaines, 2008), overexploitation, pollution, human
encroachment, and disease can harm biodiversity (Kingsford et al., 2009;
Caujape-Castells et al, 2010), and reduce the ability of socio-ecological
systems to bounce back after shocks.
"	Text
"Islands are heterogeneous in geomorphology, culture, ecosystems,
populations, and hence also in their vulnerability to climate change.
Vulnerabilities and adaptation needs are as diverse as the variety of
islands between regions and even within nation states (e.g., in Solomon
Islands; Rasmussen et al., 2011), often with little climate adaptation
occurring in peripheral islands, for example, in parts of the Pacific (Nunn
et al, 2013). Quantitative comparison of vulnerability is difficult owing
to the paucity of vulnerability indicators. Generic indices of national
level vulnerability continue to emerge (Cardona, 2007) but only a
minority are focused on small islands (e.g., Blancard and Hoarau, 2013).
The island-specific indicators that exist often suffer from lack of data
(Peduzzi et al, 2009; Hughes et al., 2012), use indicators that are not
relevant in all islands (Barnett and Campbell, 2010), or use data of limited
quality for islands, such as SLR (as used in Wheeler, 2011). As a result
indicators of vulnerability for small islands often misrepresent actual
vulnerability. Recent moves toward participatory approaches that link
scientific knowledge with local visions of vulnerability (see Park et al, 2012)
offer an important way forward to understanding island vulnerability in
the absence of certainty in model-based scenarios.

"As in previous IPCC assessments, there is continuing strong support for
the incorporation of indigenous knowledge into adaptation planning.
However, this is moderated by the recognition that current practices
alone may not be adequate to cope with future climate extremes or
trend changes. The ability of a small island population to deal with
current climate risks may be positively correlated with the ability to
adapt to future climate change, but evidence confirming this remains
limited (such as Lefale, 2010). Consequently, this section focuses on
evidence for adaptive capacity that reduces vulnerability to existing

undertaken: reducing socioeconomic vulnerabilities, building adaptive

climate resilience (e.g., see McGray et al., 2007; Eakin et al., 2009).
Figure 29-5 highlights the implications of the various options. Not all
adaptations are equally appropriate in all contexts. Understanding the
baseline conditions and stresses (both climate and other) are important
in understanding which climate change adaptation option will generate

anticipate change and prepare strategies; self-awareness of human
impact on environment; willingness to change occupation; livelihood

risks for specific islands, or the limited capacity of island vulnerability
indicators, scenario based damage assessments can be undertaken.
Storm surge risks have been effectively modeled for the Andaman and

maps have been produced for both Jamaica (Miller, S. et al., 2009) and
the Chuuk Islands (Federated States of Micronesia; Harp et al., 2009).
However, the probability of change in frequency and severity of extreme
rainfall events and storm surges remains poorly understood for most small
islands. Other risks, such as the climate change-driven health risks from
the spread of infectious disease, loss of settlements and infrastructure,
and decline of ecosystems that affect island economies, livelihoods, and
human well-being also remain under-researched. Nevertheless, it is
possible to consider these risks along with the threat of rising sea level

prospects for small islands (see Table 29-4).

researchers found that a lack of demand for insurance products (in their
study countries: Grenada, Jamaica, Fiji, and Vanuatu) meant an under-

current hydro-meteorological extreme events, both in terms of the

(Anthoff et al., 2010; Table 29-5). Under climate change the risks of
damage and associated losses are expected to continue to rise (Nicholls
and Cazenave, 2010). Yet much of the existing literature on climate risk
in small islands does not consider how to address high future risks, but
instead focuses on managing present-day risks through risk transfer,
risk spreading, or risk avoidance. Risk transfer is largely undertaken
through insurance; risk spreading through access to and use of common
property resources, livelihood diversification, or mutual support through
networks (see Section 29.6.2.3); and risk avoidance through structural
engineering measures or migration (see Section 29.6.2.4).

"Traditional systems appear less effective when multiple civilization-
nature stresses are introduced. For example, in Reunion and Mayotte,
population growth, and consequent rises in land and house prices, have
led low-income families to settle closer to hazardous slopes that are
prone to landslides and to river banks which are prone to flooding (Le
Masson and Kelman, 2011). Traditional belief systems can also limit
adaptive capacity. Thus, for example, in two Fijian villages, approximately
half of survey respondents identified divine will as the cause of climate
change (Lata and Nunn, 2012). These findings reinforce earlier studies
in Tuvalu (Mortreux and Barnett, 2009), and more widely across the
Pacific (Barnett and Campbell, 2010). The importance of taking into
account local interests and traditional knowledge in adaptation in small
islands is emphasized by Kelman and West (2009) and McNamara and
Westoby (2011), yet evidence does not yet exist that reveals the limits
to such knowledge, such as in the context of rapid socio-ecological

"Traditional construction methods have long been identified across the
Pacific as a means of reducing vulnerability to tropical cyclones and
floods in rural areas. In Solomon Islands traditional practices include:
elevating concrete floors on Ontong Java to keep floors dry during heavy
rainfall events; building low, aerodynamic houses with sago palm leaves
as roofing material on Tikopia as preparedness for tropical cyclones; and
in Bellona local perceptions are that houses constructed from modern
materials and practices are more easily destroyed by tropical cyclones,
implying that traditional construction methods are perceived to be more
resilient in the face of extreme weather (Rasmussen et al., 2009). In
parallel, Campbell (2009) documents the characteristics of traditional
building styles (in Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga) where relatively steep hipped
roofs, well bound connections and joints, and airtight spaces with few
windows or doors offer some degree of wind resistance. Traditional
building measures can also reduce damages associated with earthquakes,
as evidenced in Haiti (Audefroy, 2011). By reducing damage caused by
other stresses (such as earthquakes), adaptive capacity is more likely
to be maintained. The quality of home construction is critical to its wind
resistance. If inadequately detailed, home construction will fail irrespective
of method. Although some traditional measures could be challenged as

"Traditional technologies and skills can be effective for current disaster
risk management but there is currently a lack of supporting evidence
to suggest that they will be equally appropriate under changing cultural
conditions and future climate changes on islands. Campbell (2009)
identified that traditional disaster reduction measures used in Pacific
islands focused around maintaining food security, building community
cooperation, and protecting settlements and inhabitants. Examples of
actions to maintain food security include: the production and storage
of food surpluses, such as yam and breadfruit buried in leaf-lined pits
to ferment; high levels of agricultural diversity to minimize specific
damage to any one crop; and the growth of robust famine crops, unused
in times of plenty that could be used in emergencies (Campbell, 2009).
Two discrete studies from Solomon Islands highlight the importance of
traditional patterns of social organization within communities to support
food security under social and environmental change (Reenberg et al.,
2008; Mertz et al., 2010). In both studies the strategy of relying on
traditional systems of organization for farming and land use management
have been shown to work effectively—largely as there has been little
cultural and demographic change. Nonetheless there are physical and
cultural limits to traditional disaster risk management. In relation to the
ability to store surplus production on atoll islands, on Rongelap in the
Marshall Islands, surpluses are avoided, or are redistributed to support
community bonds (Bridges and McClatchey, 2009). Further, traditional
approaches that Pacific island communities have used for survival for
millennia (such as building elevated settlements and resilient structures,
and working collectively) have been abandoned or forgotten due to
processes of globalization, colonialism, and development (Campbell,
2009). Ongoing processes of rapid urbanization and loss of language
and tradition suggest that traditional approaches may not always be
efficacious in longer term adaptation.

central, more diversified risk portfolio—offering lower premiums for

principles to reduce residential damage from hurricanes have been

However, expected levels of success have often not been achieved
owing to inadequate training of construction workers, minimal inspection

"In addition, not all engineered structures are seen as effective risk
avoidance mechanisms. In the Azores archipelago, a proliferation of
permanent engineered structures along the coastline to prevent erosion
have resulted in a loss of natural shoreline protection against wave
erosion (Calado et al., 2011). In Barbados it is recognized that seawalls
can protect human assets in areas prone to high levels of erosion;
however, they can also cause sediment starvation in other areas, interfere
with natural processes of habitat migration, and cause coastal squeeze,
which may render them less desirable for long-term adaptation (Mycoo
and Chadwick, 2012; see also Section 5.4.2.1). To reduce erosion risk
an approach with less detrimental downstream effects that also
supports tourism is beach nourishment. This is increasingly being
recommended, for example, in the Caribbean (Mycoo and Chadwick,
2012), the Mediterranean (Anagnostou et al., 2011), and western Indian
Ocean (Duvat, 2009). Beach nourishment, however, is not without its
challenges, as requirements such as site-specific oceanographic and
wave climate data, adequate sand resources, and critical engineering
design skills may not be readily available in some small islands.

"Risk can be spread socially, for example, through social networks and
familial ties (see also Section 29.6.2.3), or ecologically, for example, by
changing resource management approach. Social networks can be used
to spread risk among households. In Fiji, after Tropical Cyclone Ami in 2003,
households whose homes were not affected by the cyclone increased their
fishing effort to support those whose homes were damaged (Takasaki,
2011)—mutual support formed a central pillar for community-based
adaptation. In the case of natural systems, risks can be spread through
enhancing representation of habitat types and replication of species,
for example, through the creation of marine protected areas, around
key refuges that protect a diversity of habitat, that cover an adequate
proportion of the habitat and that protect critical areas such as nursery
grounds and fish spawning aggregation areas (McLeod et al., 2009).
Locally Managed Marine Areas—which involve the local community in
the management and protection of their local marine environment—
have proven to be effective in increasing biodiversity, and in reducing
poverty in areas dependent on marine resources in several Pacific islands
(Techera, 2008; Game et al., 2011). By creating a network of protected
areas supported by local communities the risks associated with some
forms of climate change can be spread and potentially reduced (Mills
et al., 2010) although such initiatives may not preserve thermally
sensitive corals in the face of rising SST.

displacement are frequently cited as outcomes of SLR, salinization, and
land loss on islands (Byravan and Rajan, 2006; Kolmannskog and Trebbi,
2010; see also Section 29.3.3.3). Climate stress is occurring at the same
time as the growth in rural to urban migration. The latter is leading to
squatter settlements that strain urban infrastructure—notably sewerage,
waste management, transport, and electricity (Connell and Lea, 2002;
Jones, 2005). Urban squatters on islands often live in highly exposed
locations, lacking basic amenities, leaving them highly vulnerable to
climate risks (Baker, 2012). However, a lack of research in this area

that helps people to help themselves, for example, through marine
catch monitoring (Breckwoldt and Seidel, 2012), while addressing local
priorities and building on local knowledge and capacity. This approach
to adaptation is being promoted as an appropriate strategy for small
islands, as it is something done “with” rather than “to” communities
(Warrick, 2009). Nonetheless externally driven programs to encourage
community-level action have produced some evidence of effective
adaptation. Both Limalevu et al. (2010) and Dumaru (2010) describe the
outcomes of externally led pilot CBA projects (addressing water security
and coastal management) implemented in villages across Fiji, notably
more effective management of local water resources through capacity
building; enhanced knowledge of climate change; and the establishment
of mechanisms to facilitate greater access to technical and financial

"SLR poses one of the most widely recognized climate change threats to
low-lying coastal areas on islands (Section 29.3.1). However, long-term
climate impacts depend on the type of island (see Figure 29-1) and the
adaptation strategy adopted. Small island states have 16% of their land
area in low elevation coastal areas (<10 m) as opposed to a global
average of 2%, and the largest proportion of low-elevation coastal
urban land area: 13% (along with Australia and New Zealand), in
contrast to the global average of 8% (McGranahan et al., 2007).
Statistics like these underpin the widely held view about small islands
being “overwhelmed” by rising seas associated with SLR (Loughry and
McAdam, 2008; Laczko and Aghazarm, 2009; Yamamoto and Esteban,
2010; Berringer, 2012; Dema, 2012; Gordon-Clark, 2012; Lazrus, 2012).
Yet there remains limited evidence as to which regions (Caribbean,
Pacific and Indian Oceans, West African islands) will experience the
largest SLR (Willis and Church, 2012) and which islands will experience
the worst climate impacts. Nicholls et al. (2011) have modeled impacts
of 4°C warming, producing a 0.5 to 2.0 m SLR, to assess the impacts
on land loss and migration. With no adaptation occurring, they estimate
that this could produce displacement of between 1.2 and 2.2 million
people from the Caribbean and Indian and Pacific Oceans. More
research is needed to produce robust agreement on the impact of SLR
on small islands, and on the range of adaptation strategies that could
be appropriate for different island types under those scenarios. Research
into the possible un-inhabitability of islands has to be undertaken
sensitively to avoid short-term risks (i.e, to avoid depopulation and
ultimately island abandonment) associated with a loss of confidence in
an island's future (McNamara and Gibson, 2009; McLeman, 2011).

"Collaboration between stakeholders can lessen the occurrence of simple
mistakes that can reduce the effectiveness of adaptation actions (medium
evidence, medium agreement). Evidence from the eastern Caribbean
suggests that adaptations taken by individual households to reduce
landslide risk—building simple retaining walls—can be ineffective
compared to community-level responses (Anderson et al., 2011).
Landslide risk can be significantly reduced through better hillside
drainage. In the eastern Caribbean, community groups, with input from
engineers, have constructed these networks of drains to capture surface
runoff, household roof water, and gray water. Case studies from Fiji and
Samoa in which multi-stakeholder and multi-sector participatory
approaches were used to help enhance resilience of local residents to
the adverse impacts of disasters and climate change (Gero et al., 2011)
further support this view. In the case of community-based disaster risk
reduction (CBDRR), Pelling (2011) notes that buy-in from local and
municipal governments is needed, as well as strong preexisting
relationships founded on routine daily activities, to make CBDRR effective.
Research from both Solomon Islands and the Cayman Islands reinforce
the conclusion that drivers of community resilience to hazard maps
closely onto factors driving successful governance of the commons, that
is, community cohesion, effective leadership, and community buy-in to
collective action (Tompkins et al., 2008; Schwarz et al., 2011). Where
community organizations are operating in isolation, or where there is
limited coordination and collaboration, community vulnerability is
expected to increase (Ferdinand et al., 2012). Strong local networks,
and trusting relationships between communities and government,
appear to be key elements in adaptation, in terms of maintaining
sustainable agriculture and in disaster risk management (medium
evidence, high agreement).

"Although lack of access to adequate financial, technological and human
resources is often cited as the most critical constraint, experience has
shown that endogenous factors such as culture, ethics, knowledge, and
attitudes to risk are important in constraining adaptation. Translating
the word “climate” into Marshallese implies cosmos, nature, and culture
as well as weather and climate (Rudiak-Gould, 2012). Such cultural
misunderstandings can create both barriers to action and novel ways
of engaging with climate change. The lack of local support (owing to
encroachment on traditional lands) for the development of new infiltration
galleries to augment freshwater supply on Tarawa atoll, Kiribati, highlights
the importance of social acceptability (Moglia et al., 2008a,b). Such
considerations have led to the conclusion that there is still much to be
learned about the drivers of past adaptation and how “mainstreaming”

"Notwithstanding the extensive and ever-growing body of literature
on the subject, there is still a relatively low level of awareness and
understanding at the community level on many islands about the nature
of the threat posed by climate change (Nunn, 2009). Even where the
threat has been identified, it is often not considered an urgent issue,
or a local priority, as exemplified in Malta (Akerlof et al., 2010) and
Funafuti, Tuvalu (Mortreux and Barnett, 2009). Lack of awareness,
knowledge, and understanding can function as an effective barrier to
the implementation and ultimate success of adaptation programs.
This is borne out in both Fiji and Kiribati, where researchers found that
spiritual beliefs, traditional governance mechanisms, and a short-term
approach to planning were barriers to community engagement and
understanding of climate change (Kuruppu, 2009; Lata and Nunn, 2012).
Although widely acknowledged to be critical in small islands, few
initiatives pay little more than perfunctory attention to the importance of
awareness, knowledge, and understanding in climate change adaptation
planning. Hence, the renewed call for adaptation initiatives to include
and focus directly on these elements on an ongoing basis (e.g., Crump,
2008; Kelman and West, 2009; Kelman, 2010; Gero et al., 2011; Kuruppu
and Liverman, 2011) is timely, if these barriers are to be eventually
removed.

"There is a growing body of literature that discusses the benefits and
possibilities of mainstreaming or integrating climate change policies in
development plans. Various mechanisms through which development
agencies as well as donor and recipient countries can seek to capitalize
on the opportunities to mainstream are beginning to emerge (see, e.g.,
Klein et al., 2007; Mertz et al., 2009). Agrawala and van Aalst (2008)
provide examples, from Fiji and elsewhere, of where synergies (and
trade-offs) can be found in integrating adaptation to climate change
into development cooperation activities, notably in the areas of disaster
risk reduction, community-based approaches to development, and
building adaptive capacity. Boyd et al. (2009) support the need for more
rapid integration of adaptation into development planning, to ensure
that adaptation is not side-lined, or treated separately from sectoral
policies. Although there are synergies and benefits to be derived from
the integration of climate change and development policies, care is
needed to avoid institutional overlaps, and differences in language and
approach— which can give rise to conflict (Schipper and Pelling, 2006).
Overall, there appears to be an emerging consensus around the views
expressed by Swart and Raes (2007) that climate change and development
strategies should be considered as complementary, and that some
elements such as land and water management and urban, peri-urban,
and rural planning provide important adaptation, development, and
mitigation opportunities. Although the potential to deliver such an
integrated approach may be reasonably strong in urban centers on
islands, there appears to be limited capacity to mainstream climate
change adaptation into local decision making in out-lying islands or
peripheral areas (Nunn et al., 2013).
"	Text
"Since publication of the SAR in 1996, significant barriers to climate
change adaptation strategies in island settings have been discussed
in considerable detail. Barriers include inadequate access to financial,
technological, and human resources; issues related to cultural and social
acceptability of measures; constraints imposed by the existing political
and legal framework; the emphasis on island development as opposed
to sustainability; a tendency to focus on addressing short-term climate
variability rather than long-term climate change; and community
preferences for “hard” adaptation measures such as seawalls instead of
“soft” measures such as beach nourishment (Sovacool, 2012). Heger et
al. (2008) recognized that more diversified economies have more robust
responses to climate stress, yet most small islands lack economies of
scale in production, thus specializing in niche markets and developing
monocultures (e.g., sugar or bananas). Non-sovereign island states face
additional exogenous barriers to adaptation. For example, islands such
as Réunion and Mayotte benefit from the provision of social services
somewhat similar to what obtains in the Metropole, but not the level
of enforcement of building codes and land use planning as in France
(Le Masson and Kelman, 2011). Owing to their nature and complexity,
these constraints will not be easily eliminated in the short term and will
require ongoing attention if their impact is to be minimized over time.
Exogenous factors such as the comparatively few assessments of social
vulnerability to climate change, adaptation potential, or resilience for
island communities (Barnett, 2010) limit current understanding. In part
this is due to the particularities of islands—both their heterogeneity
and their difference from mainland locations—as well as the limitations
of climate models in delivering robust science for small islands. It
remains the case that, 13 years after Nurse et al. (2001) noted that
downscaled global climate models do not provide a complete or
necessarily accurate picture of climate vulnerabilities on islands, there
is still little climate impacts research that reflects local concerns and
contexts (Barnett et al., 2008).

"Small islands are not homogeneous. Rather they have diverse geophysical
characteristics and economic structures (see Table 29-2; Figure 29-1).
Following Nunn (2009), the combination of island geography and
economic types informs the extent to which adaptation and mitigation
actions might interact. The geography and location of islands affect their
sensitivity to hydro-meteorological and related hazards such as cyclones,
floods, droughts, invasive alien species, vector-borne disease, and
landslides. On the other hand, the capacity of island residents to cope
is often related to income levels, resources endowment, technology,
and knowledge (see Section 29.6.2).

"In the absence of significant mitigation efforts at the global scale,
adaptation interventions could become very costly and difficult to
implement, once certain thresholds of change are reached (Birkmann,
2011; Nelson, 2011). Nicholls et al. (2011) make a similar observation
with respect to coastal protection as a response to SLR. They suggest
that if global mean temperatures increase by around 4°C (which
may lead to sea level rise between 0.5 m and 2 m) the likelihood of
successful coastal protection in some locations, such as low-lying small
islands, will be low. Consequently, it is argued that the relocation of
communities would be a likely outcome in such circumstances (Nicholls
et al., 2011).

"The potential for mitigation and emissions reductions in islands depends
to a large extent on their size and stage of economic development. In
the small and less developed islands key “mitigation” sectors including
energy, transport, industry, built environment, agriculture, forestry, or
waste management sectors are generally relatively small (IPCC, 2007;
Swart and Raes, 2007). Hence opportunities for emissions reductions
are usually quite limited and are mostly associated with electricity
generation and utilization of vehicles. More mitigation opportunities
should exist in more economically advanced and larger islands that rely
on forms of production that utilize fossil fuels, including manufacturing,
and where vehicle usage is extensive and electricity-driven home
appliances, such as air conditioners and water heaters, are extensively
used.

"GHG emissions from most small islands are negligible in relation to
global emissions, yet small islands will most probably be highly impacted
by climate change (Srinivasan, 2010). However, many small island
governments and communities have chosen to attempt to reduce their
GHG emissions because of the cost and the potential co-benefits and
synergies. Malta and Cyprus are obliged to do so in line with EU climate
and energy policies. This section considers some of the interlinkages
between adaptation and mitigation on small islands and the potential
synergies, conflicts, trade-offs, and risks. Unfortunately there is relatively
little research on the emissions reduction potential of small islands, and
far less on the interlinkages between climate change adaptation and
emissions reduction in small islands. Therefore in this section a number
of assumptions are made about how and where adaptation and
mitigation actions interact.
"	Text
"Small islands have relatively large coastal zones (in comparison to
land area) and most development (as well as potential mitigation and
adaptation activities) are located in the coastal zone. Coastal ecosystems
(coral reefs, seagrasses, and mangroves) play an important role in
protecting coastal communities from wave erosion, tropical cyclones,
storm surges, and even moderate tsunami waves (Cochard et al., 2008).
Although coastal forests—including both endemic and exotic species,
especially mangroves—are seen as effective adaptation options
(“bioshields”; Feagin et al., 2010) in the coastal zones, they also play an
important role in mitigation as carbon sinks (van der Werf et al., 2009).
Thus, the management and conservation of mangrove forests has the
potential to generate synergies between climate change adaptation and
mitigation. However, despite this knowledge, population, development,
and agricultural pressures have constrained the expansion of island
forest carbon stocks (Fox et al., 2010) while Gilman et al. (2008) note
that such pressures can also reduce the buffering capacity of coastal
vegetation systems.

"Renewable energy resources on small islands have only recently been
considered within the context of long-term energy security (Chen et al.,
2007; Praene et al., 2012). Stuart (2006) speculates that the lack of
uptake of renewable technologies to date might be due to historical
commitments to conventional fossil fuel-based infrastructure, and a lack
of resources to undertake research and development of alternatives.
Those islands that have introduced renewable energy technologies have
often done so with support from international development agencies
(Dornan, 2011). Despite this, there remain significant barriers to the
wider institutionalization of renewable technologies in small islands.
Research in Europe and the USA has shown the mitigation and cost
savings benefits of Energy Service Companies (ESCOs): companies that
enter into medium- to long-term performance-based contracts with
energy users, invest in energy-efficiency measures in buildings and firms,
and profit from the ensuing energy savings measures for the premises
(see, e.g., Steinberger et al., 2009). Potential benefits exist in creating
the opportunity for ESCOs to operate in small islands. Preliminary
evidence from Fiji suggests that if the incentive mechanisms can be
resolved, and information asymmetries between service providers and
users can be aligned, ESCOs could provide an opportunity to expand
renewable technologies (Dornan, 2009). IPCC (2011) presents examples
of opportunities for renewable energy, including wind energy sources,
as deployed in the Canary Islands.

some guidance, caution must be exercised to ensure that the transfer of such experiences is appropriate to local
biophysical, social, economic, political, and cultural circumstances. If this approach is not purposefully incorporated
into the implementation process, it is possible that maladaptation and inappropriate mitigation may result. It is
therefore necessary to carefully assess the risk profile of each individual island so as to ensure that any investments
in adaptation and mitigation are context specific. The varying risk profiles between individual small islands and
small island regions have not always been adequately acknowledged in the past.

"Although there is a clear consensus that adaptation to the risks posed
by global climate change is necessary and urgent in small islands, the
implementation of specific strategies and options is a complex process
that requires critical evaluation of multiple factors, if expected outcomes
are to be achieved (Kelman and West, 2009; Barnett and O'Neill, 2012).
These considerations may include, inter alia, prior experience with similar
or related threats, efficacy of the strategies or options and their co-
benefits, costs (monetary and non-monetary), availability of alternatives,
and social acceptability. In addition, previous work (e.g., Adger et al.,
2005) has emphasized the relevance of scale as a critical factor when
assessing the efficacy and value of adaptation strategies, as the extent
to which an option is perceived to be a success, failure, or maladaptive
may be conditioned by whether it is being assessed as a response to
climate variability (shorter term) or climate change (longer term).

"Many small islands rely heavily on the foreign exchange from tourism
to expand and develop their economies, including the costs of mitigation
and adaptation. Tourism, particularly in small islands, often relies on
coastal and terrestrial ecosystems to provide visitor attractions and
accommodation space. Recognizing the relationship between ecosystem
services and tourism in Jamaica, Thomas-Hope and Jardine-Comrie (2007)
suggest that sustainable tourism planning should include activities
undertaken by the industry, that is, tertiary treatment of waste and reuse
of water, as well as composting organic material and investing in
renewable energy. Gdssling and Schumacher (2010) and others who
have examined the linkages between GHG emissions and sustainable
tourism argue that the tourism sector (operators and tourists) should
pay to promote sustainable tourism, especially where they benefit directly
from environmental services sustained by these investments.

"As in other regions, adaptation in islands is locally delivered and context
specific (Tompkins et al., 2010). Yet, sectors and communities on small
islands are often so intricately linked that there are many potential
pathways that may lead to maladaptation, be it via increased GHG
emissions, foreclosure of future options, or burdensome opportunity
costs on local communities. There is also a concern that some types of
interventions may actually be maladaptive. For example, Barnett and
O'Neill (2012) suggest that strategies such as resettlement and migration
should be regarded as options of “last resort” on islands, as they may
actually discourage viable adaptation initiatives, by fostering over-
dependence on external support. They further argue that a priori
acceptance of adaptation as an efficacious option for places like the
Pacific Islands may also act as a disincentive for reducing GHG emissions
(Barnett and O'Neill, 2012).

"Energy prices in small islands are among the highest anywhere in the

the judicious exploitation of renewable energy sources, combined with
the implementation of energy-efficiency measures (van Alphen et al.,
2008; Banuri, 2009; Mohanty, 2012; Rogers et al., 2012). Realizing the
potential for such transformation, the countries comprising the Alliance
of Small Island States (AOSIS) launched SIDS Dock, which is intended
to function as a “docking station” to connect the energy sector in small
island developing states with the international finance, technology, and

the Government of Australia collapsed before a mutually acceptable

proposal to relocate (Tabucanon and Opeskin, 2011). Overall, however,
it is suggested that states contemplating long-term, off-island migration
may wish to consider early proactive planning, as resettlement of entire
communities might prove to be socially, culturally, and economically
disruptive (Campbell, 2010; McMichael et al., 2012; see also Section

"Other studies reveal that new paradigms whose adoption can reduce
the risk of maladaptation in island environments are emerging across
various sectors. In the area of natural resource management, Hansen
et al. (2010) suggest that the use of protected areas for climate refugia,
reduction of non-climate stressors on ecosystems, and adoption of
adaptive management approaches, combined with reduction of GHG
emissions wherever possible, may prove to be more effective response
strategies than traditional conservation approaches. Other strategic
approaches, including the implementation of multi-sectoral and cross-
sectoral measures, also facilitate adaptation in a more equitable,
integrated, and sustainable manner. Similarly, “no-regret” measures
such as wastewater recycling, trickle irrigation, conversion to non-fossil
fuel-based energy, and transportation which offer collateral benefits
with or without the threat of climate change and “low-regret” strategies,
which may increase existing operational costs only marginally, are
becoming increasingly attractive options to island governments (Gravelle
and Mimura, 2008; Heltberg et al., 2009; Howard et al., 2010). Together,
these constitute valid risk management approaches, as they are designed
to assist communities in making prudent, but necessary decisions in the
face of an uncertain future.

"Similarly, although insurance is being promoted as an element of the
overall climate change response strategy in some island regions, for
example, the Caribbean, concerns have been expressed about possible
linkages to maladaptation. The potential consequences include the
imposition of exorbitant premiums that are beyond the capacity of
resource-scarce governments as the perception of climate change risks
increase, discriminatory coverage of sectors that may not align with
local priorities, and tacit encouragement for the state, individuals, and
the private sector to engage in behavior that is not risk-averse, for
example, development in hazard-prone areas (Herweijer et al., 2009;
Linnerooth-Bayer et al., 2011; Thomas and Leichenko, 2011; van
Nostrand and Nevius, 2011). Likewise, although the exploitation of
renewable energy is vital to the sustainable development of small
islands, more attention needs to be paid to the development of energy
storage technologies, if rapid transition from conventional fuels is to be
achieved in an efficient manner. This is especially important in the case of
intermittent energy sources (e.g., solar and wind), as the cost of current
storage technologies can frustrate achievement of full conversion to
renewable energy. Thus to avoid the possibility of maladaptation in
the sector, countries may wish to consider engaging in comprehensive
planning, including considerations relating to energy storage (Krajaci¢
et al., 2010; Bazilian et al., 2011).

Because most socioeconomic decisions are taken at the local level,
there is a need for a more extensive database of simulations of future
small island climates and socioeconomic conditions at smaller spatial
scales.

Difficulties in detecting and attributing past impacts on
small islands to climate change processes. Further investigation
of the observed impacts of weather, climate, and ocean events that
may be related to climate change is required to clarify the relative
role of climate change and non-climate change drivers.
Uncertainty in the projections is not a sufficiently valid
reason to postpone adaptation planning in small islands. In
several small islands adaptation is being progressed without a full
understanding of past or potential impacts and vulnerability.
Although assessment of future impacts is hampered because of
uncertainty in climate projections at the local island level, alternative
scenarios based on a general understanding of broad trends could
be used in vulnerability and sensitivity studies to guide adaptation
strategies.

Need for a range of climate change-related projections
beyond temperature and sea level. Generally, climate-model
projections of temperature and sea level have been satisfactory,
but there are strong requirements for projections for other variables
that are of critical importance to small islands. These include rainfall
and drought, wind direction and strength, tropical storms and wave
climate, and recognition that transboundary processes are also
significant in a small island context. Although some such work has
been undertaken for some parts of the Pacific (Australian Bureau
of Meteorology and CSIRO, 2011a,b), similar work still needs to be
carried out in other small island regions. In addition, the reliability
of existing projections for some of the other parameters needs to
be improved and the data should be in suitable formats for use in
risk assessments.

Need to acknowledge the heterogeneity and complexity of
small island states and territories. Although small islands have
several characteristics in common, neither the variety nor complexity
of small islands is sufficiently reflected in the literature. Thus,
transfer of data and practices from a continental situation, or from
one small island state to another, needs to be done with care and
in a manner that takes full cognizance of such heterogeneity and
complexity.

Within-country and -territory differences need to be better
understood. Many of the environmental and human impacts
reported in the literature on islands have been attributed to the
whole country, when in fact they refer only to the major center or
town or region. There is need for more work on rural areas, outer
islands, and secondary communities. Several examples of such
research have been cited in this chapter. Also it should be noted
that some small island states are single islands and others highly
fragmented multiple islands.

Lack of investment and attention to climate and environmental
monitoring frameworks in small islands. A fundamental gap in
the ability to improve empirical understanding of present and future
climate change impacts is the lack of climate and environmental
monitoring frameworks that in turn hampers the level of confidence
with which adaptation responses can be designed and implemented.

The Ocean plays a central role in Earth’s climate and has absorbed 93% of the extra energy from the enhanced greenhouse effect
and approximately 30% of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO,) from the atmosphere. Regional responses are addressed here by
dividing the Ocean into seven sub-regions: High-Latitude Spring Bloom Systems (HLSBS), Eastern Boundary Upwelling Ecosystems (EBUE),
Coastal Boundary Systems (CBS), Equatorial Upwelling Systems (EUS), Subtropical Gyres (STG), Semi-Enclosed Seas (SES), and the Deep Sea
(DS; >1000 m). An eighth region, Polar Seas, is dealt with by Chapter 28. {Figure 30-1; WGI AR5 6.3.1; WGI AR5 Boxes 3.1, 3.8}

The average sea surface temperature (SST) of the Indian, Atlantic, and Pacific Oceans has increased by 0.65°C, 0.41°C, and 0.31°C,
respectively, over the period 1950-2009 (very likely, p-value < 0.05). Changes in the surface temperatures of the ocean basins are
consistent with temperature trends simulated by ocean-atmosphere models with anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing over the past
century (high confidence). Sub-regions within the Ocean also show robust evidence of change, with the influence of long-term patterns of variability
(e.g., Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO); Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO)) contributing to variability at regional scales, and making
changes due to climate change harder to distinguish and attribute. {30.3.1; Figure 30-2e-g; Table 30-1; WGI ARS 2.4.2-3, 3.2, 10.4.1, 14}

"Rapid changes in physical and chemical conditions within ocean sub-regions have already affected the distribution and abundance

zooplankton migrating at the fastest rates, particularly in HLSBS regions. Changes to sea temperature have also altered the phenology, or timing

"Global warming will result in more frequent extreme events and greater associated risks to ocean ecosystems (high confidence).
In some cases (e.g., mass coral bleaching and mortality), projected increases will eliminate ecosystems, and increase risks and vulnerabilities to
coastal livelihoods and food security (e.g., CBS in Southeast Asia; SES, CBS, and STG in the Indo-Pacific) (medium to high confidence). Reducing
stressors not related to climate change represents an opportunity to strengthen the ecological resilience within these regions, which may help
them survive some projected changes in ocean temperature and chemistry. {5.4, 30.5.3-4, 30.5.6, 30.6.1; Figure 30-4; Box CC-CR; IPCC, 2012}

(Pacific EUS: 0.43°C, Atlantic EUS: 0.54°C; very likely, p-value < 0.05). Although warming is consistent with changes in upwelling intensity,
there is low confidence in our understanding of how EUS will change, especially in how El Nifio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and other patterns

microbial respiration and reduce O, levels (medium confidence). Oxygen concentrations are also declining in the tropical Pacific, Atlantic, and
Indian Oceans (particularly EUS) due to reduced 0, solubility at higher temperatures, and changes in ocean ventilation and circulation. {6.3.3,

the risk of greater thermal stratification in some regions, which can lead to reduced O, ventilation and the formation of additional hypoxic
Zones, especially in the Baltic and Black Seas (medium confidence). In some CBS, such as the East China Sea and Gulf of Mexico, these changes
are further influenced by the contribution of nutrients from coastal pollution contributing to the expansion of hypoxic (low O,) zones. These

and use of ocean-based infrastructure, together with the evolution of policy (medium agreement). Risks and uncertainties will increase with
further climate change. New opportunities as well as risks for shipping, energy, and mineral extraction, and international issues over access

Oceans by 9%, 12%, and 11%, respectively, over and above the inherent seasonal and interannual variability from 1998 to 2010
(high confidence; p-value < 0.05). Significant warming over this period has resulted in increased water column stratification, reduced mixed
layer depth, and possibly decreases in nutrient availability and ecosystem productivity (limited evidence, medium agreement). The short time
frame of these studies against well-established patterns of long-term variability leads to the conclusion that these changes are about as likely
as not due to climate change. {6.3.4, 30.5.6; Table 30-1; Box CC-PP; WGI AR5 3.8.4}

"Significant opportunity exists within the Ocean and its sub-regions for reducing the CO, flux to the atmosphere (limited evidence,

(eg., Blue Carbon; limited evidence, medium agreement). Blue Carbon strategies can also be justified in terms of the ecosystem services provided
by coastal vegetated habitats such as protection against coastal erosion and storm damage, and maintenance of habitats for fisheries species.
Sequestration of anthropogenic CO, into deep ocean areas still faces considerable hurdles with respect to the expense, legality, and vulnerability
of storage sites and infrastructure. There are also significant opportunities with the Ocean for the development of offshore renewable energy
such as wind and tidal power. {5.5.7, 30.6.1, 30.6.4}

"Changes to ocean temperature, chemistry, and other factors are generating new challenges for fisheries, as well as benefits (high
agreement). Climate change is a risk to the sustainability of capture fisheries and aquaculture development, adding to the threats of over-
fishing and other non-climate stressors. In EUS and STG, shifts in the distribution and abundance of large pelagic fish stocks will have the
potential to create “winners” and “losers” among island nations and economies. There has been a boost in fish stocks of high-latitude fisheries
in the HLSBS of the North Pacific and North Atlantic, partly as a result of 30 years of increase in temperature. This is very likely to continue,
although some fish stocks will eventually decline. A number of practical adaptation options and supporting international policies can minimize
the risks and maximize the opportunities. {7.4.2, 7.5.1.1.2, 29.4, 30.6-7}

"Adaptation strategies for ocean regions beyond coastal waters are generally poorly developed but will benefit from international
legislation and expert networks, as well as marine spatial planning (high agreement). Fisheries and aquaculture industries with high
technology and/or large investments, as well as marine shipping and oil and gas industries, have high capacities for adaptation due to greater
development of environmental monitoring, modeling, and resource assessments. For smaller scale fisheries and developing nations, building
social resilience, alternative livelihoods, and occupational flexibility represent important strategies for reducing the vulnerability of ocean-
dependent human communities. Building strategies that include climate forecasting and early-warning systems can reduce impacts of warming
and ocean acidification in the short term. Overall, there is a strong need to develop ecosystem-based monitoring and adaptation strategies to
mitigate rapidly growing risks and uncertainties to the coastal and oceanic industries, communities, and nations (high agreement). {7.5.1.1,

"International frameworks for collaboration and decision making are critically important for coordinating policy that will enable
mitigation and adaptation by the Ocean sectors to global climate change (e.g., United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
(UNCLOS)). These international frameworks offer an opportunity to solve problems collectively, including improving fisheries management
across national borders (e.g., reducing illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing), responding to extreme events, and strengthening
international food security. Given the importance of the Ocean to all countries, there is a need for the international community to progress
rapidly to a “whole of ocean” strategy for responding to the risks and challenges posed by anthropogenic ocean warming and acidification.

"An integrated assessment of the impacts of climate change and ocean
acidification on the Ocean as a region was not included in recent IPCC
assessments, although a chapter devoted to the Ocean in the Second
Assessment Report (SAR) did “attempt to assess the impacts of projected
regional and global climate changes on the oceans” (Ittekkot et al.,
1996). The fact that assessments for ocean and coastal systems are
spread throughout previous IPCC assessment reports reduces the
opportunity for synthesizing the detection and attribution of climate
change and ocean acidification across the physical, chemical, ecological,
and socioeconomic components of the Ocean and its sub-regions. The
IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) concluded, however, that, while
terrestrial sub-regions are warming faster than the oceans, “Observations
since 1961 show that the average temperature of the global ocean has
increased to depths of at least 3000 m and that the ocean has been
taking up over 80% of the heat being added to the climate system”
(AR4 Synthesis Report, p. 30). AR4 also concluded that sea levels had

"The Ocean exerts a profound influence as part of the Earth, interacting
with its atmosphere, cryosphere, land, and biosphere to produce planetary
conditions. It also directly influences human welfare through the provision
and transport of food and resources, as well as by providing cultural
and economic benefits. The Ocean also contributes to human welfare
indirectly through the regulation of atmospheric gas content and the
distribution of heat and water across the planet. This chapter examines
the extent to which regional changes to the Ocean can be accurately
detected and attributed to anthropogenic climate change and ocean
acidification, building on the conclusions of Chapter 6, which focuses
on the marine physiological and ecological responses to climate change
and ocean acidification. Detailed assessment of the role of recent physical
and chemical changes within the Ocean to anthropogenic climate change
is provided in WGI ARS (particularly Chapters 2, 3, 13, and 14). In this
chapter, impacts, risks, and vulnerabilities associated with climate change
and ocean acidification are assessed for seven ocean sub-regions, and
the expected consequences and adaptation options for key ocean-based
sectors are discussed. Polar oceans (defined by the presence of sea ice
in the north and by the Polar Front in the south) are considered in
Chapter 28.
"	Text
"Generally, successful attribution to climate change occurs when the full
range of possible forcing factors is considered and those related to
climate change are found to be the most probable explanation for the
detected change in question (Section 18.2.1.1). Comparing detected
changes with the expectations of well-established scientific evidence
also plays a central role in the successful attribution of detected
changes. This was attempted for seven sub-regions of the Ocean. There
are a number of general limitations to the detection and attribution of
impacts to climate change and ocean acidification that are discussed
elsewhere (Section 18.2.1) along with challenges (Section 18.2.2).
Different approaches and “best practice” guidelines are discussed in
WGI ARS Chapters 10 and 18, as well as in several other places (Hegerl
et al., 2007, 2010; Stott et al., 2010). The fragmentary nature of ocean
observing, structural uncertainty in model simulations, the influence of
long-term variability, and confounding factors unrelated to climate
change (e.g., pollution, introduced species, over-exploitation of fisheries)
represent major challenges (Halpern et al., 2008; Hoegh-Guldberg et
al., 2011b; Parmesan et al., 2011). Different factors may also interact
synergistically or antagonistically with each other and climate change,
further challenging the process of detection and attribution (Hegerl et
al., 2007, 2010).

"The Ocean represents a vast region that stretches from the high tide
mark to the deepest oceanic trench (11,030 m) and occupies 71% of
the Earth's surface. The total volume of the Ocean is approximately
1.3 billion km?, with approximately 72% of this volume being below
1000 m (Deep Sea (DS); Section 30.5.7). There are considerable challenges
in assessing the regional impacts of climate change on the Ocean.
Devising an appropriate structure to explore the influence of climate
change across the entire Ocean region and the broad diversity of life
forms and habitats is challenging. Longhurst (1998) identified more
than 50 distinct ecological provinces in the Ocean, defined by physical
characteristics and the structure and function of phytoplankton
communities. Longhurst's scheme, however, yields far more sub-regions
than could be sensibly discussed in the space allocated within AR5.
Consequently, comparable principles were used with a division of the
non-polar ocean into seven larger sub-regions similar to Barber (1988).
It is recognized that these sub-regions do not always match physical-
chemical patterns or specific geographies, and that they interact strongly
with terrestrial regions through weather systems and the exchange of
materials. Different ocean sub-regions may also have substantially
different primary productivities and fishery catch. Notably, more than
80% of fishery catch is associated with three ocean sub-regions:
Northern Hemisphere High-Latitude Spring Bloom Systems (HLSBS),
Coastal Boundary Systems (CBS), and Eastern Boundary Upwelling
Ecosystems (EBUE; Table SM30-1, Figure 30-1). The DS (>1000 m) is
included as a separate category that overlaps with the six other ocean
sub-regions dealt with in this chapter.

"While some regions (e.g., North Pacific) did not show a clear warming
trend, most regions showed either significant warming in the average
temperature, or significant warming in either/or the warmest and
coolest months of the year, over the period 1950-2009 (HadISST1.1
data; Table 30-1). Trends in SST show considerable sub-regional
variability (Table 30-1; Figure 30-2a). Notably, the average temperature
of most HLSBS did not increase significantly from 1950 to 2009
(except in the Indian Ocean; Table 30-1) yet the temperatures of the
warmest month (North and South Atlantic, and Southeastern Pacific)
and of the coolest month (North and South Atlantic, and South Pacific)
showed significant upward trends over this period (p-value < 0.05;

"Substantial evidence presented in AR4 indicated that changing ocean
conditions have extensively influenced marine ecosystems (WGII AR4
Table 1.5). AR4 noted that there is an “accumulating body of evidence
to suggest that many marine ecosystems, including managed fisheries,
are responding to changes in regional climate caused predominately by
warming of air and sea surface temperatures (SST) and to a lesser extent
by modification of precipitation regimes and wind patterns” (WGII AR4
Section 1.3.4.2, p. 94). Observed changes in marine ecosystems and
managed fisheries reported within AR4 included changes to plankton
community structure and productivity, the phenology and biogeography
of coastal species, intertidal communities on rocky shores, kelp forests,
and the distribution of pathogens and invasive species. Changes were
also observed in coral reefs (primarily increased mass coral bleaching
and mortality) and migratory patterns and trophic interactions of marine
birds, reptiles, and mammals, as well as of a range of other marine
organisms and ecosystems (WGIl AR4 Table 1.5), although a separate
exercise in detection and attribution of changes due to climate change
(as done for terrestrial studies) was not done as part of AR4.

"of the United States and the United Kingdom (WGIlI AR4 Section 1.3.3.1,
p. 92). The AR4 assessment was virtually certain that rising atmospheric
carbon dioxide (CO,) had changed carbonate chemistry of the ocean (i.e.,
buffering capacity, carbonate and bicarbonate concentrations), and that
a decrease in surface pH of 0.1 had occurred over the global ocean
(calculated from the uptake of anthropogenic CO, between 1750 and
1994; Sabine et al., 2004; Raven et al., 2005; WGI AR4 Section 5.4.2.3;
WGI AR4 Table 7.3). Large-scale changes in ocean salinity were also
observed from 1955 to 1998 and were “characterized by a global
freshening in sub-polar latitudes and salinification of shallower parts of
the tropical and subtropical oceans” (WGI AR4 Chapter 5 ES, p. 387). In
this case, freshening was observed in the Pacific, with increased salinity
being observed in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans (WGI AR4 Sections
5.3.2-5). These changes in surface salinity were qualitatively consistent
with expected changes to surface freshwater flux. Freshening of mid-
and high-latitude waters together with increased salinity at low latitudes
were seen as evidence “of changes in precipitation and evaporation
over the oceans” (WGI AR4 SPM, p. 7).

"ARS Section 3.2.3, Figure 3.2, Box 3.1). It is certain that global
average SSTs have increased since the beginning of the 20th century,
with improvements and growth of data sets and archives, and the
understanding of errors and biases since AR4 (WGI ARS Section 2.4.2).
It is virtually certain that the upper ocean (0 to 700 m depth) has warmed
from 1971 to 2010 (Figure 30-2a), while it is /ikely that the surface layers
of the Ocean have warmed from the 1870s to 1971. Rates of increase
in temperature are highest near the surface of the Ocean (>0.1°C per
decade in the upper 75 m from 1971 to 2010) decreasing with depth
(0.015°C per decade at 700 m; Figure 30-2b,c). It is very likely that the
intensification of this warming near the surface has increased thermal
stratification of the upper ocean by about 4% between 0 and 200 m depth
from 1971 to 2010 in all parts of the ocean north of 40°S. It is likely
that the Ocean has warmed between 700 and 2000 m from 1957 to
2010, with the warming signal becoming less apparent or non-existent
at deeper depths (WGI ARS Sections 3.2.1-3, Figures 3.1, 3.2, 3.9). These
changes include a significant anthropogenic signal (virtually certain;
Gleckler et al., 2012; Pierce et al., 2012), with the surface waters of all
three ocean basins warming at different rates that exceed those
expected if there were no changes to greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing
over the past century (Figure 30-2e,f,g). In this respect, the observed
record also falls within the range of historical model outputs that include
increases in the concentration of GHGs as opposed to models that do
not (Figure 30-2e,f,g).

regions defined for analysis, see Figure S$M30-1 and Table SM30-2, column 1). A linear regression was fitted to the average of all 1x1 degree monthly SST data extracted from
the Hadley Centre HadISST1.1 data set (Rayner et al, 2003) for each sub-region over the period 1950-2009. All SST values less than —1.8°C, together with all SST pixels that
were flagged as being sea ice, were reset to the freezing point of seawater (—1.8°C) to reflect the sea temperature under the ice. Separate analyses were also done to explore
trends in the temperatures extracted from the coldest-ranked and the warmest-ranked month of each year (Table SM30-2). The table includes the slope of the regression (°C per
decade), the p-value for the slope being different from zero and the total change over 60 years (i.e., the slope of linear regression multiplied by six decades) for each category.
The p-values that exceed 0.05 plus the associated slope and change values have an orange background, denoting the lower statistical confidence in the slope being different

"Given the essential role that temperature plays in the biology and
ecology of marine organisms (Box CC-MB; Sections 6.2-3; Portner, 2002;
Poloczanska et al., 2013), the speed of isotherm migration ultimately
determines the speed at which populations must either move, adapt,
or acclimate to changing sea temperatures (Portner, 2002; Burrows et
al., 2011; Hoegh-Guldberg, 2012). Burrows et al. (2011) calculated the
rate at which isotherms are migrating as the ratio of the rate of SST
change (°C yr) to the spatial gradient of temperature (°C km) over the
period 1960-2009 (Figure 30-3). Although many of these temperature
trajectories are toward the polar regions, some are not and are influenced
by features such as coastlines. This analysis and others (e.g., North
Atlantic; Gonzdlez-Taboada and Anadon, 2012) reveals that isotherms
in the Ocean are moving at high velocities (to over 200 km per decade),
especially at low latitudes (high confidence; Figure 30-3). Other sub-
regions showed smaller velocities with contracting isotherms (cooling)
in some areas (e.g., the Central and North Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans;
Figure 30-3). There are also changes in the timing of seasonal temperatures
in both spring and fall/autumn (Burrows et al., 2011; Poloczanska et al.,
2013), which, together with other variables (e.g., light, food availability,
geography), are likely to affect biological processes such as the
migration of species to higher latitudes, and the timing and synchrony
of reproductive and other seasonal behaviors.

regions in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans have the greatest levels of
accumulated heat stress (Figure 30-4a). These are areas rich in thermally
sensitive coral reefs (Figure 30-4b; Strong et al, 2011). There was also
a higher proportion of years that have had at least one stress event

the maximum monthly mean (MMM) climatology from 1985 to 2000,
ensuring that all anomalies were comparable across time periods and
across RCPs (Figure 30-10). Model hind-cast changes matched those
observed for ocean sub-regions for the period 1980-2009 (HadISST1.1;
Figure 30-2), with the model ensemble slightly overestimating the extent
of change across the different ocean sub-regions (slope of observed/
model = 0.81, ? = 0.76, p-value < 0.001). In this way, the absolute
amount of change projected to occur in the ocean sub-regions was
calculated for near-term (2010-2039) and long-term (2070-2099)
periods (Table SM30-4). In the near term, changes in the temperature
projected for the surface layers of the Ocean were largely indistinguishable
between the different RCP scenarios owing to the similarity in forcing
up to 2040. By the end of the century, however, SSTs across the ocean
sub-regions were 1.8°C to 3.3°C higher under RCP8.5 than those
projected to occur under RCP2.6 (Table $M30-4; Figure 30-2e,f,g). The
implications of these projected changes on the structure and function
of oceanic systems are discussed below.

"Solar insolation plays a crucially important role in the biology of many
marine organisms, not only as a source of energy for photosynthesis
but also as a potential co-stressor in the photic zone (with temperature),
as is seen during mass coral bleaching and mortality events (e.g.,
Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999). Global surface solar insolation (from the
National Centers for Environmental Prediction—National Center for
Atmospheric Research (NCEP—NCAR) Reanalysis Project; Kalnay et al.,
1996) decreased by 4.3 W m7 per decade from the 1950s until 1991,
after which it increased at 3.3 W m7 per decade until 1999 (Ohmura,

ambiguity and therefore /ow confidence in observations of global-scale
cloud variability and trends (WGI AR5 Section 2.5.6). There is also jow
confidence in projections of how cloudiness, solar insolation, and
precipitation will change as the planet warms due to the large interannual

Decadal Oscillation (PDO)), short observation time series, and uneven
spatial sampling, particularly in the early record (before 1950; WGI AR5

"Although there is low confidence for long-term trends in tropical cyclone
activity globally (largely due to the lack of reliable long-term data sets),
it is virtually certain that the frequency and intensity of the strongest
tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic have increased since the 1970s
(WGI ARS Section 2.6.3). There is medium agreement that the frequency
of the most intense cyclones in the Atlantic has increased since 1987
(WGI ARS Section 2.6.3) and robust evidence of inter-decadal changes in
the storm track activity within the North Pacific and North Atlantic (Lee
et al., 2012). It is also /ikely that there has been a decrease in the number
of land-falling tropical cyclones along the East Australian coast since
the 19th century (WGI ARS Section 2.6.3; Callaghan and Power, 2011).
It is likely that these patterns are influenced by interannual variability
such as ENSO, with land-falling tropical cyclones being twice as common
in La Nifia versus El Nifio years (high confidence; Callaghan and Power,
2011). There has been an increase in the number of intense wintertime
extratropical cyclone systems since the 1950s in the North Pacific.
Similar trends have been reported for the Asian region, although analyses
are limited in terms of the spatial and temporal coverage of reliable
records (WGI ARS Section 2.6.4). There is low confidence, however, in
large-scale trends in storminess or storminess proxies over the last century
owing to the lack of long-term data and inconsistencies between studies
(WGI ARS Section 2.6.4).

"There has been a poleward movement of circulation features, including
a widening of the tropical belt, contraction of the northern polar vortex,
and a shift of storm tracks and jet streams to higher latitudes (medium
confidence; WGI ARS Sections 2.7.5-6, 2.7.8; WGI AR5 Box 2.5). Long-
term patterns of variability (years to decades) continue to prevent robust
conclusions regarding long-term changes in atmospheric circulation and
winds in many cases (WGI ARS Section 2.7.5). There is high confidence,
however, that the increase in northern mid-latitude westerly winds from
the 1950s to the 1990s, and the weakening of the Pacific Walker
Circulation from the late 19th century to the 1990s, have been largely
offset by recent changes (WGI AR5 Sections 2.7.5, 2.7.8; WGI AR5
Box 2.5). Wind stress has increased since the early 1980s over the
Southern Ocean (medium confidence; WGI AR5 Section 3.4.4), and
tropical Pacific since 1990 (medium confidence), while zonal mean wind
stress may have declined by 7% in the equatorial Pacific from 1862—
1990 due to weakening of the tropical Walker Circulation (medium
confidence; WGI ARS Section 3.4.4; Vecchi et al., 2006). For example, it
is very likely that the subtropical gyres of the major ocean basins have
expanded and strengthened since 1993. However, the short-term nature
of observing means that these changes are as likely as not to be due to
decadal variability and/or due to longer term trends in wind forcing
associated with climate change (WGI ARS Section 3.6). Other evidence
of changes in ocean circulation is limited to relatively short-term records
that suffer from low temporal and spatial coverage. Therefore, there is
very low confidence that multi-decadal trends in ocean circulation can
be separated from decadal variability (WGI ARS Section 3.6.6). There is
no evidence of a long-term trend in large-scale currents such as the
Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), Indonesian
Throughflow (ITF), the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), or the

thermal stratification has reduced ocean ventilation and the depth of

consequently primary productivity (medium confidence; Section 6.3.4).
In the STG, which dominate the three major ocean basins (Section

that other processes (e.g., ENSO, PDO, North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO),
winds, eddies, advection) can counteract broad-scale trends at local
scales (Box CC-PP). The continued warming of the surface layers of the
Ocean will very likely further enhance stratification and potentially limit
the nutrient supply to the euphotic zone in some areas. The response

"The global water cycle is dominated by evaporation and precipitation
occurring over ocean regions, with surface ocean salinity varying with
temperature, solar radiation, cloud cover, and ocean circulation (Deser
et al., 2004). Changes in salinity influence stratification of water masses
and circulation. Ocean salinity varies regionally (Figure 30-6a) and is a
function of the balance between evaporation and precipitation (Durack
and Wijffels, 2010; WGI ARS Section 3.3). Evaporation-dominated
regions (Figure 30-6b) such as the STG and Atlantic and Western Indian
Oceans (WGI ARS Section 3.3.3) have elevated salinity, while areas of
high precipitation such as the North Pacific, northeastern Indian Ocean,
Southeast Asia, and the eastern Pacific have relatively low salinities
(WGIARS Section 3.3.3; Figure 30-6a). It is likely that large-scale trends
in salinity have also occurred in the Ocean interior, deriving from
changes to salinity at the surface and subsequent subduction (WGI AR5
Section 3.3).
"	Text
"Salinity trends are consistent with the amplification of the global
hydrological cycle (Durack et al., 2012; Pierce et al., 2012), a consequence
of a warmer atmosphere very likely producing the observed trend in
greater precipitation, evaporation, atmospheric moisture (Figure 30-6b),
and extreme events (WGI ARS Sections 2.6.2.1, 3.3.4; IPCC, 2012).
Spatial patterns in salinity and evaporation-precipitation are correlated,
providing indirect evidence that these processes have been enhanced
since the 1950s (WGI ARS Sections 3.3.2-4; WGI AR5 Figures 3.4, 3.5,
3.20d; WGI ARS FAQ 3.3). These trends in salinity are very likely to have
a discernible contribution from anthropogenic climate change (WGI
ARS Section 10.4.2). The combined changes in surface salinity and
temperature are consistent with changes expected due to anthropogenic
forcing of the climate system and are inconsistent with the effects of
natural climate variability, either internal to the climate system (e.g.,
ENSO, PDO; Figure 30-6c,d) or external to it (e.g., solar forcing or
volcanic eruptions; Pierce et al., 2012). There is high confidence between
climate models that the observed trends in ocean salinity will continue
as average global temperature increases (Durack and Wijffels, 2010;
Terray et al., 2012). Ramifications of these changes are largely unknown
but are of interest given the role of ocean salinity and temperature in
fundamental processes such as the AMOC.

"In less than 150 years, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have resulted in such major physical and chemical changes
in our oceans that it will take thousands of years to reverse them. There are a number of reasons for this. Given
its large mass and high heat capacity, the ability of the Ocean to absorb heat is 1000 times larger than that of the
atmosphere. The Ocean has absorbed at least nine-tenths of the Earth’s heat gain between 1971 and 2010. To reverse
that heating, the warmer upper layers of the Ocean have to mix with the colder deeper layers. That mixing can take
as much as 1000 years. This means it will take centuries to millennia for deep ocean temperatures to warm in response
to today’s surface conditions, and at least as long for ocean warming to reverse after atmospheric GHG concentrations
decrease (virtually certain). But climate change-caused alteration of basic conditions in the Ocean is not just about
temperature. The Ocean becomes more acidic as more carbon dioxide (CO,) enters it and will take tens of thousands
of years to reverse these profound changes to the carbonate chemistry of the ocean (virtually certain). These enormous
physical and chemical changes are producing sweeping and profound changes in marine ecosystems. Large and
abrupt changes to these ecosystems are unlikely to be reversible in the short to medium term (high confidence).

"Dissolved O, is a major determinant of the distribution and abundance
of marine organisms (Section 6.3.3). Oxygen concentrations vary across
ocean basins and are lower in the eastern Pacific and Atlantic basins,
and northern Indian Ocean (Figure 30-9b; Section 6.1.1.3). In contrast,
some of the highest concentrations of 0, are associated with cooler high-
latitude waters (Figure 30-9b). There is high agreement among analyses
providing medium confidence that 0, concentrations have decreased
in the upper layers of the Ocean since the 1960s, particularly in the
equatorial Pacific and Atlantic Oceans (WGI ARS Section 3.8.3; WGI AR5
Figure 3.20). A formal fingerprint analysis undertaken by Andrews et al.
(2013) concluded that recent decreases in oceanic O, are due to external
influences (very likely). Conversely, O, has increased in the North and
South Pacific, North Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, and is consistent with
greater mixing and ventilation due to strengthening wind systems (WGI
ARS Section 3.8.3). The reduction in O, concentration in some areas of the
Ocean is consistent with that expected from higher ocean temperatures
and a reduction in mixing (increasing stratification) (WGI ARS Section
3.8.3). Analysis of ocean O, trends over time (Helm et al., 2011b) reveals
that the decline in O, solubility with increased temperature is responsible
for no more than 15% of the observed change. The remaining 85%,
consequently, is associated with increased deep-sea microbial respiration
and reduced 0, supply due to increased ocean stratification (WGI AR5
Section 6.1.1.3). In coastal areas, eutrophication can lead to increased
transport of organic carbon into adjacent ocean habitats where microbial
metabolism is stimulated, resulting in a rapid drawdown of 0, (Weeks
et al., 2002; Rabalais et al., 2009; Bakun et al., 2010).

"Overall, observations from a wide range of laboratory, mesocosm, and
field studies reveal that marine macro-organisms and ocean processes
are sensitive to the levels of ocean acidification projected under elevated
atmospheric CO, (high confidence; Box CC-OA, Section 6.3.2; Munday
et al., 2009; Kroeker et al, 2013). Ecosystems that are characterized by
high rates of calcium carbonate deposition (e.g., coral reefs, calcareous
plankton communities) are sensitive to decreases in the saturation states
of aragonite and calcite (high confidence). These changes are very likely
to have broad consequences such as the loss of three-dimensional coral
reef frameworks (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007; Manzello et al., 2008;
Fabricius et al., 2011; Andersson and Gledhill, 2013; Dove et al., 2013)
and restructuring of food webs at relatively small (~50 ppm) additional
increases in atmospheric CO,. Projected shoaling of the aragonite and
calcite saturation horizons are /ikely to impact deep water (100 to
2000 m) communities of scleractinian corals and other benthic organisms
as atmospheric CO, increases (Orr et al., 2005; Guinotte et al., 2006;
WGI ARS Section 6.4.4), although studies from the Mediterranean
and seamounts off southwest Australia report that some deep water
corals may be less sensitive (Thresher et al., 2011; Maier et al. 2013).
Organisms are also sensitive to changes in pH with respect to
physiological processes such as respiration and neural function
(Section 6.3.2). Owing to the relatively short history, yet growing effort,
to understand the implications of rapid changes in pH and ocean
carbonate chemistry, there are a growing number of organisms and
processes reported to be sensitive. The impact of ocean acidification on
marine organisms and ecosystems continues to raise serious scientific

"High-Latitude Spring Bloom Systems (HLSBSs) stretch from 35°N to the
edge of the winter sea ice (and from 35°S to the polar front) and provide
36% of world’s fish catch (Figure 30-1b). Although much of the North
Pacific is iron limited (Martin and Fitzwater, 1988) and lacks a classical
spring bloom (McAllister et al., 1960), strong seasonal variability of
primary productivity is pronounced at all high latitudes because of
seasonally varying photoperiod and water column stability (Racault et
al., 2012). Efficient transfer of marine primary and secondary production
to higher trophic levels, including commercial fish species, is influenced
by the magnitude as well as the spatial and temporal synchrony
between successive trophic production peaks (Hjort, 1914; Cushing,

expected in the distribution and abundance of marine organisms in

and acidification reveals that relatively small changes in temperature
and other variables can result in often large biological responses that
range from simple linear trends to more complex non-linear outcomes.
There has been an increase in studies that focus on the influence and
consequences of climate change for marine ecosystems since AR4

"The greater thermal inertia of the Ocean means that temperature anomalies and extremes are lower than those
seen on land. This does not necessarily mean that impacts of ocean warming are less for the ocean than for land.
A large body of evidence reveals that small amounts of warming in the Ocean can have large effects on ocean
ecosystems. For example, relatively small increases in sea temperature (as little as 1°C to 2°C) can cause mass coral
bleaching and mortality across hundreds of square kilometers of coral reef (high confidence). Other analyses have
revealed that increased temperatures are spreading rapidly across the world’s oceans (measured as the movement
of bands of equal water temperature or isotherms). This rate of warming presents challenges to organisms and
ecosystems as they try to migrate to cooler regions as the Ocean continues to warm. Rapid environmental change
also poses steep challenges to evolutionary processes, especially where relatively long-lived organisms such as corals

"Climate change is virtually certain to drive major changes to the northern
fringes of the Atlantic HLSBS by 2100. For the Barents Sea region, which
borders the HLSBS and Arctic regions, modeling projections from 1995 to
2060 (SRES B2 scenario) gave an increase in phytoplankton production
of 8%, an increase in Atlantic zooplankton production of 20%, and a
decrease of Arctic zooplankton production of 50% (Ellingsen et al., 2008).
These changes result in a total increase in zooplankton production in
the HLSBS section of the Barents Sea and a decrease in the Arctic section.
Together with poleward shifts of fish species, a substantial increase in
fish biomass and catch is also very likely at the northern fringes of the
HLSBS (Cheung et al., 2011). However, for some species such as capelin,
which feeds in summer at the ice edge and spawns in spring at the
southern Atlantic Norwegian/Murman coast of the Barents Sea, the
continuous temperature increase is very likely to cause discontinuous
changes in conditions. The limited migration potential for this small

days from the 1960s to the 2000s, but its warm-water equivalent, C.
helgolandicus, did not advance (Bonnet et al., 2005). In the North Sea,
bottom temperatures in winter have warmed by 1.6°C (1980-2004;
Dulvy et al., 2008). The whole demersal fish community shifted deeper
by 3.6 m per decade over the period 1980-2004, although mean latitude
of the whole community did not show net displacement (Dulvy et al.,
2008). Within the community, cool-water specialists generally shifted
northward while abundant warm-water species shifted southward,
reflecting winter warming of the southern North Sea. The cold winter
temperatures of the shallow regions of the southern North Sea have
acted to exclude species with warm-water affinities. Trawl survey
data from the rapidly warming southern North Sea suggests waves of
immigration by southern species such as red mullet (Mullus surmuletus),
anchovy (Engraulis encrasicholus), and sardines (Sardina pilchardus),
linked to increasing population sizes and warming temperatures (Beare

"The major portion of the literature on the influence of climate change
on the North Atlantic region covers time spans that are longer than for
most other sub-regions of the Ocean. Even here, however, the bulk of
the literature is limited to the last 30 to 50 years. The few publications
covering the first half of the 20th century represent an important longer
term perspective on the influence of climate change (Toresen and
Qstvedt, 2000; Drinkwater, 2006; Sundby and Nakken, 2008; Bafion,
2009; Astthorsson et al., 2012). For example, distinct changes in fauna
were associated with a pronounced warming period over 1920-1940
(Wood and Overland, 2010), when fish and other fauna shifted northward
(Iversen, 1934; Southward et al., 2005; Drinkwater, 2006; Hatun et al.,
2009). The major lesson from these reports is that a rapid large-scale
temperature increase occurred in the high-latitude North Atlantic
between the 1920s and 1940s, with basin-scale consequences for
marine ecosystems that are comparable to warming and observed
impacts over the last 30 years. The former event was of great concern
within the scientific community, particularly during the late 1940s and
early 1950s (Iversen, 1934; Taning, 1949, 1953; Southward, 1980).
However, with the subsequent long-term cooling in the 1970s, discussion
around climate responses was discontinued (Southward, 1980). The
centennial-long perspective indicates that multi-decadal variability has
played a major role in changes observed over the past 30 years. The
150-year instrumental record shows distinct warm phases of the AMO
during approximately 1930-1965 and from 1995, and cool phases
between approximately 1900-1930 and 1960-1995 (WGI ARS Section
14.7.6). However, it is virtually certain that the enhanced warming in
recent decades cannot be explained without external forcing (WGI
ARS Section 10.3.1.1.3). Understanding the changes in inter-decadal
variability over the next century is particularly important. The current
warm phase of the AMO is /ikely to terminate in the next few decades,
leading to a cooling influence in the North Atlantic and potentially
offsetting some of the effects of global warming (WGI ARS Sections
11.3.2.4.1, 14.7.6). Over the transition period, the climate of the North
Atlantic is likely to change more rapidly than during previous transitions
since 1900.

This region underwent major changes in recent decades as a result of
climate variability, climate change, and fishing impacts (Litzow et al.,

2006), although there is no linear trend between 1953 and 2006, and
the initiation of spring ice retreat over the southeastern Bering Sea shelf

high-latitude ecosystems in the North Pacific HLSBS (eastern Bering Sea

These periods were associated with regime shifts in foraging fish that
occurred in 1979-1982, 1988-1992, and 1998-2001. The changes
indicate how basin-scale variability such as the PDO can manifest
across distinct ecosystems (Overland et al., 2008; Link et al., 2009a,b).
Phenological shifts observed in the zooplankton communities of the
North Pacific were very likely in response to decadal climate variability,
with distinct changes noted after the climate shifts of the 1970s and
1990s (Mackas et al., 1998; Peterson and Schwing, 2003; Chiba et al.,

occurrences of the negative phase but the credibility of projections
remains uncertain (WGI ARS Section 14.7.3). It is about as likely as not
that the PDO will change its form or behavior in the future (WGI AR5

"Over a vast region of the eastern Pacific stretching from southern Chile
to the Aleutian Islands, waters low in dissolved 0, (Oxygen Minimum
Zone (OMZ)) are found at 300 m depth (Karstensen et al., 2008).
Sporadic upwelling of these low-O, waters along the continental shelf
is well documented, where biological respiration can further reduce
dissolved O, levels and result in hypoxic or anoxic conditions that lead
to mortality of coastal fishes and invertebrates (Grantham et al., 2004;
Chan et al., 2008). The magnitude and severity of seasonal hypoxic
conditions in shallow-shelf waters of the eastern North Pacific HLSBS
increased in recent decades (Bograd et al., 2008; Chan et al., 2008). In
addition, minimum pH values in the water column usually occur near
the depths of the OMZ (WGI ARS Box 3.2). A shoaling of the aragonite
saturation horizon has /ikely resulted in low-aragonite conditions within

in the length of the growth season and the intensity of the light available

In the long term, however, primary production may decrease due to the
reduced supply of nutrients to the surface layers (Box CC-PP). The decline

shipping routes (Section 30.6.2.3), between the North Atlantic and the

"HLSBS from warming of surface waters include changes to primary
production and carbon cycling, and the reorganization of ecosystems in
response to warmer and more acidified oceans. Both primary production

environmental change. Latitudinal shifts in the distribution of phyto- and
Zooplankton communities will alter seasonality, community composition,
and bloom dynamics (Beaugrand, 2009; Ito et al., 2010; Shoji et al., 2011).
Alteration of the structure and composition of plankton communities can
propagate through high-latitude food webs due to tight trophic linkages

Table 30-1), although some areas within this sub-region have warmed.
For example, the western Tasman Sea has shown enhanced warming
since 1900 as compared to average global trends (high confidence).
This has been driven by changes in large-scale wind-forcing leading to
a southward expansion of the South Pacific STG and intensification of
the southward-flowing East Australian Current (EAC; Cai, 2006; Hill et

contribute to the observed trend in wind stress (Cai and Cowan, 2007).
Coinciding with this warming and intensified EAC is the observation
that a number of benthic invertebrates, fish, and zooplankton are now

declines during El Nifio events, when the trade winds weaken, or even
reverse, and is strengthened during La Nifia events. ENSO periodicity

"Drifting microscopic plants known as phytoplankton are the dominant marine primary producers at the base of

future changes in fisheries and marine ecosystems (low confidence). Changes have been reported to a range of
different ocean systems (e.g., High-Latitude Spring Bloom Systems, Subtropical Gyre Systems, Equatorial Upwelling
Systems, and Eastern Boundary Upwelling Ecosystems), some of which are consistent with changes in ocean
temperature, mixing, and circulation. However, direct attribution of these changes to climate change is made difficult
by long-term patterns of variability that influence productivity of different parts of the Ocean (e.g., Pacific Decadal

sub-regions are projected to continue to warm significantly (p-value <

Sea warmed by 0.74°C from 1982 to 2006 (Belkin, 2009), although
trends in the average SST, however, are not significant from 1950 to
2009 (p-value > 0.05; Table 30-1) owing to a high degree of variability
involved when longer periods were examined (supplementary material
in Belkin, 2009). The temperature of the warmest month of the year,
however, showed a significant increase over the 60-year period (0.05°C
per decade; Table 30-1). Regional trends within the Red Sea may also
differ, with at least one other study reporting higher rates of warming

"Long-term monitoring of coral community structure and size over 20
years shows that average colony size of corals has declined (high

confidence). The decline in average colony size is ascribed to heat-
mediated bleaching as well as increases in coral diseases and crown of
thorns starfish (Acanthaster sp.) predation (Riegl et al., 2012). The
patterns of this decline correlate well with the pattern of recent heating
in the Red Sea (Raitsos et al., 2011), with the biggest changes being
seen in the southern part of the Red Sea. Skeletal growth of the long-
lived massive coral Diploastrea heliopora has declined significantly, very
likely due to warming temperatures (medium confidence; p-value = 0.05;

"Semi-Enclosed Seas (SES) represent a subset of ocean sub-regions
that are largely land locked and consequently heavily influenced by
surrounding landscapes and local climates (Healy and Harada, 1991). In
most cases, they support small but regionally significant fisheries (3.3%
of global production; Table SM30-1; Figure 30-1b) and opportunities for
other industries such as tourism. Five SES (all over 200,000 km? with
single entrances <120 km wide) are considered here. This particular
geography results in reduced circulation and exchange with ocean waters,
and jurisdictions for these water bodies that are shared by two or more
neighboring states. In many cases, the small volume and disconnected
nature of SES (relative to coastal and oceanic environments) makes
them highly vulnerable to both local and global stressors, especially with
respect to the much reduced options for the migration of organisms as
conditions change.

"There is low confidence in the current understanding of how (or if)
climate change will influence the behavior of ENSO and other long-term
climate patterns (Collins et al., 2010; WGI AR5 Section 12.4.4.2). There
is also low agreement between different CMIP5 General Circulation
Models (GCMs) on how ocean warming will affect ENSO, with no
significant change to ENSO amplitude in half of the models examined,
and both increasing and decreasing activity in others (Guilyardi et al.,
2012). These differences appear to be a consequence of the delicate
balance within ENSO between dampening and amplifying feedbacks,
and the different emphasis given to these processes within the different
GCMs (Collins et al., 2010). Other studies have looked at the interaction
between the STG and EUS, and warming of surface waters in the Pacific,
with at least one study projecting the possible expansion of the STG at
the expense of the EUS (Polovina et al., 2011). In the latter case, the
area of equatorial upwelling within the North Pacific would decrease
by 28%, and primary production and fish catch by 15%, by 2100. Many
of the projected changes imply additional consequences for pelagic
fisheries resulting from the migration of fish stocks deriving from
changing distribution of particular sea temperatures (Lehodey et al., 2006,
2008, 2011; Cheung et al., 2010; Sumaila et al, 2011; Bell et al., 2013b).
These projections suggest that fisheries within EUS will experience
increased vulnerability as a result of climate change (low confidence).

"35°C). Like other SES, the Arabian Gulf is particularly vulnerable to
changing environmental conditions as a result of its landlocked nature.
Trends in SST were not significant over the period 1950-2009 (Table
30-1), which is probably due to long-term variability, and a consequence
of regional and abrupt changes that occurred in the late 1980s (Conversi
et al., 2010). In keeping with this, recent (1985-2002) localized analyses
(e.g., Kuwait Bay) show strong and significant warming trends (based
in this case on Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellite data)
of 0.6°C per decade (Al-Rashidi et al., 2009). There is limited evidence
and low agreement as to how this variability influences marine ecosystems
and human activities within the Arabian Gulf, although impacts on some
ecosystem components (e.g., coral reefs) have been defined to some
extent. The mass coral bleaching and mortality that occurred in 1996
and 1998 were a direct result of the sensitivity of reef-building corals
to unusually elevated sea temperatures (high confidence; Riegl, 2002,
2003; Box CC-CR). These changes to coral reefs have resulted in a loss
of fish species that feed on coral-associated invertebrates while
herbivores and planktivorous fish abundances have increased (medium
confidence; Rieg|, 2002). Despite coral ecosystems in this sub-region
being adapted to some of the highest temperatures in shallow seas on
Earth, anthropogenic climate change is driving higher frequencies and
intensities of mass coral bleaching and mortality (Riegl et al., 2011).
Other biological changes (e.g., harmful algal blooms and fish kills; Heil
et al., 2001) have been associated with the increasing sea temperatures
of the Arabian Gulf, although attribution to increasing temperatures as
opposed to other factors (e.g., water quality) is limited (Bauman et al.,

seen in any SES (Belkin, 2009). Increases of this magnitude are not seen
in longer records throughout the Baltic Sea (1861-2001: MacKenzie et

the Baltic Sea, for example, Gdansk Basin (Aleksandrov et al., 2009)
and central Baltic (Fonselius and Valderrama, 2003; Méllmann et al.,

"Cantin et al. (2010) proposed that the massive coral Diploastrea helipora
will cease to grow in the central Red Sea by 2070 under SRES A1B and
A2 (medium confidence), although this may not hold for other coral
species. For example, an increase in linear extension of Porites corals,
beginning in the 1980s, was recorded in the northern Red Sea (Heiss,
1996), where temperatures have increased by 0.74°C from 1982 to 2006
(Belkin, 2009), suggesting that these corals were living in sub-optimal
conditions (cooler waters). They may therefore benefit from elevated
temperature before reaching their thermal threshold, at which point
growth rates would be predicted to decline, as they are doing in other
oceans. Rieg| and Piller (2003) concluded that coral habitats at moderate
depths in the Red Sea might provide important refugia from some aspects
of climate change in the future (/imited evidence). Silverman et al.
(2007) quantified the sensitivity of net coral reef ecosystem calcification
to changes in carbonate chemistry (pH, aragonite saturation). Their
results demonstrate a strong negative effect of ocean acidification on
ecosystem-scale calcification and decalcification, and show that small
changes in carbonate dissolution could have large-scale implications
for the long-term persistence of carbonate coral reef systems within the
Red Sea (Silverman et al., 2007, 2009).

"The annual biomass of phytoplankton has declined almost threefold in
the Baltic Transition Zone (Kattegat, Belt Sea) and Western Baltic Sea
since 1979 (Henriksen, 2009), reputedly due to changing nitrogen loads
in the Danish Straits (medium confidence) in addition to increasing
sea temperature (very likely; Madsen and Hgjerslev, 2009). Reduced
phytoplankton production may have decreased the productivity of
fisheries in the western Baltic Sea and the Transition Zone (/ow to
medium confidence; Chassot et al., 2007). Decreasing salinity in the Baltic
deep basins may also affect zooplankton reproduction, especially that of
the copepod Pseudocalanus acuspes, contributing to density-dependent
decrease in growth of the commercially important herring and sprat
stocks (high confidence; Mollmann et al., 2003, 2005; Casini et al., 2011).
The strong relationship between phytoplankton and fish production, and
increasing sea temperature, decreasing salinity, and other environmental
factors, suggests that major changes in fisheries production will occur
as sea temperatures increase and the hydrological cycle in the Baltic
region changes (high confidence; MacKenzie et al., 2012). A combination
of climate change-induced oceanographic changes (i.e., decreased salinity
and increased temperatures), eutrophication, and overfishing have

0.96°C from 1982 to 2006 (Belkin, 2009), which is consistent with other
studies (high confidence; Buongiorno Nardelli et al., 2010; Bozkurt and
Sen, 2011). As with other SES (ie., Arabian Gulf and Baltic, Mediterranean,
and Red Seas), longer data sets do not reveal a significant trend due to
large-scale variability prior to 1982, which may be due to the influence
of AMO, NAO, and other long-term sources of variability (Table 30-1;
supplementary material in Belkin, 2009). Buongiorno Nardelli et al.
(2010) observed that short-term SST variability (week-month) is strongly
influenced by interactions with the overlying atmosphere, which itself
is strongly influenced by the surrounding land temperatures. As with
the Mediterranean and Red Seas, however, a significant upward trend
in the temperature is recorded in the warmest month of the year over
the period 1950-2009 (Table 30-1). Freshwater discharge from rivers
draining into the Black Sea has remained more or less constant since
the early 1960s (Ludwig et al., 2009). Increasing water temperature has
steadily eliminated the Cold Intermediate Layer (CIL; temperatures below
8°C) throughout the Black Sea basin over 1991-2003 (high confidence;
Oguz et al., 2003). Reduced water column mixing and upwelling during
warmer winter periods has reduced the supply of nutrients to the upper
layers of the Black Sea (Oguz et al., 2003) and expanded areas of low
0, in the deeper parts of the Black Sea, which is the world’s largest
anoxic marine basin (high confidence; Murray et al., 1989). These
changes coincided with the collapse of fish stocks and the invasion by
the ctenophore, Mnemiopsis leidyi, in the 1980s (Oguz et al., 2008),
while inputs of nutrients such as phosphate from the Danube River
has decreased strongly since 1992-1993 (Oguz and Velikova, 2010).
Environmental perturbations explain the declining levels of primary
productivity, phytoplankton, bacterioplankton, and fish stocks in the
Black Sea from the mid-1990s (Yunev et al., 2007; Oguz and Velikova,
2010). The Black Sea system is very dynamic and is strongly affected by
non-climate stressors in addition to climate change, making attribution
of detected trends to climate change difficult.

greenhouse warming (Bethoux et al., 1990; Rixen et al., 2005; Vargas-

influence of the AMO (Kerr, 2000; Moron, 2003). Reported temperature

"Longer-term data series (over several decades) of changes in relative

the pH of Mediterranean waters has decreased by 0.05 to 0.14 pH units

Touratier and Goyet, 2011). Anthropogenic CO, has penetrated the
entire Mediterranean water column, with the western basin being more

Studies that have explored the consequences of ocean acidification for
the biology and ecology of the Mediterranean Sea are rare (Martin and
Gattuso, 2009; Rodolfo-Metalpa et al., 2010; Movilla et al., 2012),
although insights have been gained by studying natural CO, seeps at
Mediterranean sites such as Ischia in Italy, where biodiversity decreases
with decreasing pH toward the vents, with a notable decline in calcifiers

vulnerability to CO, levels expected over the next 100 years (low

temperature can increase vulnerability to ocean acidification, thereby
increasing the long-term risk posed to Mediterranean organisms and

lack of trend in SES SST when examined from 1950 to 2009 (Table 30-1).
These changes in physical conditions (increased temperature, higher sea
level pressure, positive NAO index) also coincided with step changes in
the diversity and abundance of zooplankton, decreases in stock abundance
of anchovies and the frequency of “red tides,” and increases in mucilage
outbreaks (Conversi et al., 2010). Mucilage outbreaks are strongly
associated with warmer and more stratified water columns (high

microbes and potentially disease-causing organisms (likely; Danovaro

spread of warm-water species (medium confidence) such as the sardine

contributed to the spread of the invading Atlantic coral Oculina patagonia

projected for the surface waters of the Baltic Sea (4.37°C) and Arabian
Gulf (4.26°C), and lower yet substantial amounts of warming in the Red

ocean regions is very likely to increase stratification, which will reduce
the nutrient supply to the upper layers of the water column, reducing
primary productivity and driving major changes to the structure and
productivity of fisheries. Reduced mixing and ventilation, along with
increased microbial metabolism, will very likely increase hypoxia and
expand the number and extent of “dead zones.” Changing rainfall
intensity (Section 23.3; WGI ARS Section 12.4.5) can exert a strong
influence on the physical and chemical conditions within SES, and in
some cases will combine with other climatic changes to transform these
areas. These changes are likely to increase the risk of reduced bottom-
water O, levels to Baltic and Black Sea ecosystems (due to reduced
solubility, increased stratification, and microbial respiration), which is
very likely to affect fisheries. These changes will increase the frequency

activities, many of these changes are consistent with those expected as
SST increases.

"The surface waters of the SCS have been warming steadily from 1945
to 1999 with the annual mean SST in the central SCS increasing by
0.92°C (1950-2006; Cai et al., 2009), a rate similar to that observed for
the entire Indo-Pacific/Southeast Asian CBS from 1950 to 2009 (0.80°C;
Table 30-1). Significant freshening in the SCS intermediate layer since
the 1960s has been observed (Liu et al., 2007). The temperature change
of the upper layers of the SCS has made a significant contribution to
sea level variation, which is heterogeneous in space and time (Li et al.,
2002; Cheng and Qi, 2007; Liu et al., 2007).

"The South China Sea (SCS) is surrounded by continental areas and
includes large numbers of islands, and is connected to the Pacific, ECS,
and Sulu Sea by straits such as the Luzon and Taiwan Strait. The region
is greatly influenced by cyclones/typhoons, and by the Pearl, Red, and
Mekong Rivers. The region has a distinct seasonal circulation and is
greatly influenced by the southwest monsoon (in summer), the Kuroshio
Current, and northeast monsoon (in winter). The SCS includes significant
commercial fisheries areas and includes coral reefs, mangroves, and
seagrass beds.

"The aragonite saturation horizon in both the Arabian Sea and Bay of
Bengal is now 100 to 200 m shallower than in preindustrial times as a

Shoaling of the aragonite saturation horizon is likely to affect a range
of organisms and processes, such as the depth distribution of pteropods
(zooplankton) in the western Arabian Sea (medium confidence; Hitchcock

this region (high confidence; Helly and Levin, 2004; Karstensen et al.,

"The Arabian Sea and Somali Current are relatively productive ocean
areas, being strongly influenced by upwelling and the monsoonal system.
Wind-generated upwelling enhances primary production in the western
Arabian Sea (Prakash and Ramesh, 2007). Several key fisheries within
this region are under escalating pressure from both fishing and climate
change. SST increased by 0.18°C and 0.26°C in the Arabian Sea and
Somali Current, respectively, from 1982 to 2006 (HadSST2; Rayner et
al., 2003; Belkin, 2009), which is consistent with the overall warming
of the Western Indian Ocean portion of the CBS from 1950 to 2009
(0.60°C; Table 30-1). Salinity of surface waters in the Arabian Sea
increased by 0.5 to 1.0% over the past 60 years (Figure 30-6c), due to
increased evaporation from warming seas and contributions from the
outflows of the saline Red Sea and Arabian Gulf. As in other tropical
sub-regions, increasing sea temperatures have increased the frequency
of mass coral bleaching and mortality within this region (Wilkinson and
Hodgson, 1999; Goreau et al., 2000; Wilkinson, 2004).

"Identifying the extent to which climate change is influencing the SCS is
difficult due to confounding non-climate change factors and their
interactions (e.g., local human pollution, over-exploitation together with
“natural” climate variability such as EAM, ENSO, and PDO). Changing
sea temperatures have influenced the abundance of phytoplankton,
benthic biomass, cephalopod fisheries, and the size of demersal trawl
catches in the northern SCS observed over the period 1976-2004
(limited evidence, medium agreement; Ning et al., 2009). Coral reefs
and mangroves are degrading rapidly as a result of both climate change
and non-climate change-related factors (very likely; Box CC-CR; Chen
et al., 2009; China-SNAP, 2011; Zhao et al., 2012). Mass coral bleaching
and mortality of coral reefs within the SCS were triggered by elevated
temperatures in 1998 and 2007 (Yu et al., 2006; Li et al. 2011).
Conversely, warming enabled the establishment of a high-latitude, non-
carbonate, coral community in Daya Bay in northern SCS, although this
community has recently degraded as a result of increasing anthropogenic
stresses (Chen et al., 2009; Qiu et al., 2010).

"world’s most biologically diverse marine area, it includes parts of
Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Timor Leste, the Solomon Islands,

spatial variation. Trends examined over longer periods (1950-2009)
show significant warming (+0.80°C, p-value < 0.05; Table 30-1). The
sea level is rising by up to 10 mm yr“ in much of this region (Church et
al., 2004, 2006; Green et al., 2010). Like other tropical areas in the world,
coral reefs within SAS have experienced periods of elevated temperature,
which has driven several mass coral bleaching and mortality events
since the early 1980s (high confidence; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2009;
McLeod et al., 2010; Figure 30-10a). The most recent occurred during
warm conditions in 2010 (Krishnan et al., 2011). These changes are the
result of increasing ocean temperatures and are very likely to be a
consequence of anthropogenic climate change (high confidence; Box
CC-CR; WGI ARS Section 10.4.1). Although calcification rates of some
key organisms (e.g., reef-building corals; Tanzil et al., 2009) have slowed
over the past 2 decades, it is not possible to conclude that the changes
are due to ocean acidification. While a large part of the decline in coral
reefs has been due to increasing local stresses (principally destructive
fishing, declining water quality, and over-exploitation of key reef species),
projected increases in SST represent a major challenge for these valuable
ecosystems (high agreement; Burke et al., 2002; Burke and Maidens,
2004).

range of activities including mineral extraction, fishing, and tourism, which
provide employment and opportunity for almost 75 million people who
live in coastal areas of the USA, Mexico, and a range of other Caribbean
nations (Adams et al., 2004). The Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea
have warmed by 0.31°C and 0.50°C, respectively, from 1982 to 2006
(very likely; Belkin, 2009). Warming trends are not significant from
1950 to 2009 (Table 30-1), which may be partly due to spatial variability
in warming patterns (Section 30.5.3.1). The Caribbean region has
experienced a sustained decrease in aragonite saturation state from
1996 to 2006 (very likely; Gledhill et al., 2008). Sea levels within the

"Worldwide, 850 million people live within 100 km of tropical coastal
ecosystems such as coral reefs and mangroves deriving multiple benefits
including food, coastal protection, cultural services, and income from
industries such as fishing and tourism (Burke et al., 2011). Marine
ecosystems within the CBS are sensitive to increasing sea temperatures
(Figure 30-10), although detection and attribution are complicated by the
significant influence and interaction with non-climate change stressors
(water quality, over-exploitation of fisheries, coastal degradation; Box
CC-CR). Warming is likely to have changed the primary productivity of
ocean waters, placing valuable ecosystems and fisheries within the ECS
at risk (low to medium confidence). Other risks include the expansion
of hypoxic conditions and associated dead zones in many parts of the
CBS. Given the consequences for coastal ecosystems and fisheries,
these changes are very likely to increase the vulnerability of coastal
communities throughout the CBS.

"A combination of local and global disturbances has driven a large-scale
loss of reef-building corals across the Caribbean Sea since the late 1970s
(high confidence; Hughes, 1994; Gardner et al., 2003). Record thermal
stress in 2005 triggered the largest mass coral bleaching and mortality
event on record for the region, damaging coral reefs across hundreds of
square kilometers in the eastern Caribbean Sea (high confidence; Donner

than in 2005, elevated temperatures still occurred in some parts of the
Caribbean (Smith et al., 2013). Increasing temperatures in the Caribbean
have also been implicated in the spread of marine diseases (Harvell et

"The Western Indian Ocean strongly influences the coastal conditions
associated with Kenya, Mozambique, Tanzania, Madagascar, La Réunion,
Mayotte, and three archipelagos (Comoros, Mauritius, and the Seychelles).
Sea temperatures in the Western Indian Ocean have increased by 0.60°C
over 1950-2009 (high confidence; p-value < 0.05; Table 30-1), increasing
the frequency of positive thermal anomalies that have triggered mass
coral bleaching and mortality events across the region over the past
2 decades (high confidence; Baker et al., 2008; Nakamura et al., 2011;
Box CC-HS). Trends in changes in SST and surface salinity vary with
location along the East African coastline, with faster rates at higher
latitudes (Figure 30-2). Periods of heat stress over the past 20 years have
triggered mass coral bleaching and mortality on coral reef ecosystems
within this region (McClanahan et al., 2007, 2009a,b,c; Ateweberhan
and McClanahan, 2010; Ateweberhan et al., 2011). Steadily increasing
sea temperatures have also produced anomalous growth rates in long-
lived corals such as Porites (high confidence; McClanahan et al., 2009b).
Differences in the susceptibility of reef-building corals to stress from
rising sea temperatures has also resulted in changes to the composition
of coral (high confidence; p-value < 0.05; McClanahan et al., 2007) and
benthic fish communities (high confidence; p-value < 0.05; Graham et
al., 2008; Pratchett et al., 2011a). These changes are very likely to alter
species composition and potentially the productivity of coastal fisheries
(robust evidence, high agreement; high confidence; Jury et al., 2010),
although there may be a significant lag between the loss of coral
communities and the subsequent changes in the abundance and
community structure of fish populations (p-value < 0.05; Graham et al.,
2007). Some of these potential changes can be adverted or reduced by
interventions such as the establishment of marine protected areas and
changes to fishing management (McClanahan et al., 2008; Cinner et al.,
2009; Jury et al., 2010; MacNeil et al., 2010).

"How climate change will influence ocean upwelling is central to resolving
ecosystem and fishery responses within each EBUE. There is considerable

intensification of upwelling (e.g., Bakun et al., 2010; Narayan et al., 2010;
Barton et al., 2013) in all regions. This debate is outlined in Box CC-UP.
EBUE are also areas of naturally low pH and high CO, concentrations
due to upwelling, and consequently may be vulnerable to ocean
acidification and its synergistic impacts (Barton et al., 2012). A full
understanding of the consequences of ocean acidification for marine

to much smaller changes in the past over CBS regions (0.14°C to 0.80°C
from 1950-2009; Table 30-1), the projected changes of 2.44°C to
3.32°C over 2010-2099 are very likely to have large-scale and negative
consequences for the structure and function of many CBS ecosystems
(virtually certain), especially given the observed sensitivity of coral reefs

of cooler waters stimulates primary production that is transferred to
mid and upper trophic levels, resulting in substantial fish, seabird, and
marine mammal populations. As a result, the EBUE are considered
“hotspots” of productivity and biodiversity (Block et al. 2011). The high
level of productivity is a result of large-scale atmospheric pressure
gradients and wind systems that advect surface waters offshore, leading
to the upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich waters from depth (Box CC-UP;
Chavez and Messie, 2009; Chavez et al., 2011). Upwelling waters are
typically low in pH and high in CO,, and are likely to continue to enhance
changes in pH and CO, resulting from rising atmospheric CO, (Feely et

"There are extensive studies of the coupled climate-ecosystem dynamics
of individual EBUE (e.g., California Current). Decadal variability poses
challenges to the detection and attribution of changes within the EBUE
to anthropogenic climate change, although there are a number of long-
term studies that have been able to provide insight into the patterns
of change and their causes. Like other ocean sub-regions, EBUE are
projected to warm under climate change, with increased stratification
and intensified winds as westerly winds shift poleward (likely). However,
cooling has also been predicted for some EBUE, resulting from the
intensification of wind-driven upwelling (Bakun, 1990). The California
and Canary Currents have warmed by 0.73°C and 0.53°C (very likely;
p-value < 0.05, 1950-2009; Table 30-1), respectively, while no significant
trend was detected in the sea surface temperatures of the Benguela

2009 (Table 30-1). These trends match shorter-term trends for various
EBUE using Pathfinder version 5 data (Demarcq, 2009). These differences
are likely to be the result of differences in the influence of long-term
variability and the specific responses of coastal wind systems to warming,
although an analysis of wind data over the same period did not pick
up clear trends (/ow confidence, with respect to long-term wind trends;

(and elsewhere) will continue to decline and will consequently provide
significantly less ecosystem goods and services for coastal communities if
sea temperatures increase by more than 1°C above current temperatures
(Box CC-CR; Figure 30-10). Combining the known sensitivity of coral
reefs within the Caribbean and Coral Triangle sub-regions (Strong et al.,
1997, 2011; Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999), with the exposure to higher
temperatures that are projected under medium (RCP4.5) to high (RCP8.5)
scenarios, reveals that both coral reef-rich regions are virtually certain
to experience levels of thermal stress (DHM = 1) that cause coral
bleaching every 1 to 2 years by the mid- to late part of this century
(robust evidence, high agreement; very high confidence; Figures 30-4b,c,

"Most research on the Benguela Current has focused on fisheries and
oceanography, with little emphasis on climate change. As with the other
EBUE, strong interannual and inter-decadal variability in physical
oceanography make the detection and attribution of biophysical trends
to climate change difficult. Nevertheless, the physical conditions of the
Benguela Current are highly sensitive to climate variability over a range
of scales, especially to atmospheric teleconnections that alter local wind
stress (Hutchings et al., 2009; Leduc et al., 2010; Richter et al., 2010;
Rouault et al., 2010). Consequently, there is medium agreement, despite
limited evidence (Demarcq, 2009), that upwelling intensity and associated
variables (e.g., temperature, nutrient, and O, concentrations) from the
Benguela system will change as a result of climate change (Box CC-UP).

"Despite its apparent sensitivity to environmental variability, there is
limited evidence of ecological changes in the Benguela Current EBUE
due to climate change (Poloczanska et al., 2013). For example, pelagic
fish (Roy et al., 2007), benthic crustaceans (Cockcroft et al., 2008), and
seabirds (Crawford et al., 2008) have demonstrated general eastward
range shifts around the Cape of Good Hope. Although these may be
associated with increased upwelling along the South African south
coast, specific studies that attribute these changes to anthropogenic
climate change are lacking. Trawl surveys of demersal fish and cephalopod
species showed consistently predictable “hotspots” of species richness
over a 20- to 30-year study period (the earliest surveys since 1984 off
South Africa) that were associated with greater depths and cooler
bottom waters (Kirkman et al., 2013). However, major changes in the
structure and function of the demersal community have been shown in
some parts of the Benguela Current EBUE in response to environmental

"The temperature of the surface waters of the Benguela Current did not
increase from 1950 to 2009 (p-value > +0.05; Table 30-1), although
shorter records show an decrease in the south-central Benguela Current
(0.35°C to 0.55°C per decade; Rouault et al., 2010) or an increase for
the whole Benguela region (0.24°C; Belkin, 2009). These differences
between short versus long records indicate the substantial influence of
long-term variability on the Benguela system (Belkin, 2009). Information
on other potential consequences of climate change within the Benguela
system is sparse. SLR is similar to the global mean, although it has not
been measured rigorously within the Benguela (Brundrit, 1995; Veitch,
2007). Although upwelling water in the northern and southern portions
of the Benguela Current exhibits elevated and suppressed partial pressure
of CO,, respectively (Santana-Casiano et al., 2009), the consequences
of changing upwelling intensity remain poorly explored with respect to
ocean acidification. Finally, although periodic hypoxic events in the
Benguela system are largely driven by natural advective processes, these
may be exacerbated by future climate change (Monteiro et al., 2008;

"Most observations suggest that the Canary Current has warmed since
the early 1980s (Aristegui et al., 2009; Belkin, 2009; Demarcq, 2009;
Barton et al., 2013), with analysis of HadISST1.1 data from 1950 to 2009
indicating warming of 0.53°C from 1950-2009 (p-value < 0.05; Table
30-1). Gomez-Gesteira et al. (2008) suggest a 20 and 45% decrease in
the strength of upwelling in winter and summer, respectively, from 1967
to 2006, consistent with a decrease in wind strength and direction over
the past 60 years. More recently, Barton et al. (2013) show no clear
increasing or decreasing trend in wind strength over the past 60 years,
and a lack of agreement among wind trends and variability from
different wind products (e.g., Pacific Fisheries Environmental Laboratory
(PFEL), International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set
(ICOADS), Wave- and Anemometer-based Sea Surface Wind (WASWind)).
Barton et al. (2013) present no evidence for changes in upwelling
intensity, with the exception of upwelling off northwest Spain, where
winds are becoming slightly less favorable. Alteration of wind direction
and strength influences upwelling and hence nutrient concentrations;
however, nutrient levels can also change in response to other variables
such as the supply of iron-laden dust from the Sahara (Alonso-Pérez et
al., 2011). There is medium evidence and medium agreement that
primary production in the Canary Current has decreased over the past
2 decades (Aristegui et al., 2009; Demarcq, 2009), in contrast to the
nearby upwelling region off northwest Spain where no significant trend
was observed (Bode et al., 2011). Satellite chlorophyll records (Sea-
viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), Moderate Resolution
Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS)) are relatively short, making it difficult
to distinguish the influence of warming oceans from longer term patterns
of variability (Aristegui et al., 2009; Henson et al., 2010). Changing
temperature has resulted in changes to important fisheries species. For
example, Mauritanian waters have become more suitable as feeding
and spawning areas for some fisheries species (e.g., Sardinella aurita)
as temperatures increased (Zeeberg et al., 2008). Clear attribution of
these changes depends on the linkage between the Azores High and
global temperature, and on longer records for both physical and
biological systems, as pointed out for data sets in general (Aristegui et
al., 2009; Henson et al., 2010).

portions of the Humboldt Current, although wind has decreased in its
southern and northern sections (Demarcq, 2009). The lack of a consistent
warming signal may be due to the strong influence of adjacent ENSO
activity exerting opposing drivers on upwelling and which, if they
intensify, would decrease temperatures (limited evidence, medium

"The Humboldt Current is the largest of the four EBUE, covering an area
larger than the other three combined. It comprises the eastern edge
of the South Pacific Gyre, linking the northern part of the Antarctic
Circumpolar Current with the Pacific South Equatorial Current. Although
the primary productivity per unit area is modest compared to that of
the other EBUE, the total Humboldt Current system has very high levels
of fish production. Current catches are in line with a long-term average
(since the 1960s) of 8 million tonnes yr (www.seaaroundus.org/Ime/
13/1.aspx), although decadal-scale variations range from 2.5 to 13
million tonnes yr. While anchovies currently contribute 80% of the
total catch, they alternate with sardines on a multi-decadal scale, with
their dynamics mediated by the approach and retreat of subtropical
waters to and from the coast (Alheit and Bakun, 2010). This variability
does not appear to be changing due to anthropogenic climate change.
Thus, from the late 1970s to the early 1990s, sardines were more
important (Chavez et al., 2003). The other major commercial fish species

from 1985 to 2007 (Demarcq, 2009). Like other EBUE, the California
Current is characterized by large-scale interannual and inter-decadal
climate-ecosystem variability (McGowan et al., 1998; Hare and Mantua,
2000; Chavez et al., 2003; Checkley and Barth, 2009). During an El Nifio,
coastally trapped Kelvin waves from the tropics deepen the thermocline,
thereby severely reducing upwelling and increasing ocean temperatures
from California to Washington (Peterson and Schwing, 2003; King et al.,
2011). Atmospheric teleconnections to the tropical Pacific alter wind
stress and coastal upwelling. Therefore, the ENSO is intimately linked
with Bakun’s (1990) upwelling intensification hypothesis (Box CC-UP).
Inter-decadal variability in the California Current stems from variability
in the Pacific-North America pattern (Overland et al., 2010), which is
influenced by the PDO (Mantua et al., 1997; Peterson and Schwing,
2003) and the NPGO (Di Lorenzo et al., 2008). The major effects of the
PDO and NPGO appear north of 39°N (Di Lorenzo et al., 2008; Menge

sources of nutrient input and fishing pressure (Bakun et al., 2010). This

"Changes in the intensity of upwelling within the EBUE will drive
fundamental changes to the abundance, distribution, and viability of
resident organisms, although an understanding of their nature and
direction is limited. In some cases, large-scale decreases in primary
productivity and dependent fisheries are projected to occur for EBUE
ecosystems (Blanchard et al., 2012), while other projections question
the strong connection between primary productivity and fisheries
production (Aristegui et al., 2009). Increased upwelling intensity also
has potential disadvantages. Elevated primary productivity may lead
to decreasing trophic transfer efficiency, thus increasing the amount of
organic carbon exported to the seabed, where it is virtually certain to
increase microbial respiration and hence increase low O, stress (Weeks
et al., 2002; Bakun et al., 2010). Increased wind stress may also increase
turbulence, breaking up food concentrations (affecting trophic transfer),
or causing excessive offshore advection, which could remove plankton
from shelf habitats. The central issue for the EBUE is therefore whether
or not upwelling will intensify and, if so, whether the negative
consequences (e.g., reduced O, and elevated CO,) associated with
upwelling intensification will outweigh potential benefits from increased
primary production and fisheries catch.

"Dissolved oxygen is a major determinant of the distribution and abundance of marine organisms. Dead zones are
persistent hypoxic conditions where the water doesn’t have enough dissolved oxygen to support oxygen-dependent
marine species. These areas exist all over the world and are expanding, with impacts on coastal ecosystems and
fisheries (high confidence). Dead zones are caused by several factors, particularly eutrophication where too many
nutrients run off coastal cities and agricultural areas into rivers that carry these materials out to sea. This stimulates
primary production, leading to a greater supply of organic carbon, which can sink into the deeper layers of the
ocean. As microbial activity is stimulated, there is a sharp reduction in dissolved oxygen levels and an increased risk
of dead zones (high confidence). Climate change can influence the distribution of dead zones by increasing water
temperature and hence microbial activity, as well as reducing mixing (i.e., increasing layering or stratification) of
the Ocean, thereby reducing mixing of oxygen-rich surface layers into the deeper parts of the Ocean. In other
areas, increased upwelling can lead to stimulated productivity, which can also lead to more organic carbon entering
the deep ocean, where it is consumed, decreasing oxygen levels (medium confidence). Managing local factors such
as the input of nutrients into coastal regions can play an important role in reducing the rate at which dead zones
are spreading across the world’s oceans (high agreement).

Chlorophyll levels did not change in the remaining two gyres (SPAC and

significant expansion of the world’s most unproductive waters, although
caution must be exercised given the limitations of satellite detection
methods (Box CC-PP) and the shortness of records relative to longer-
term patterns of climate variability. There is high confidence that
changes that reduce the vertical transport of nutrients into the euphotic

"Reduction of ocean productivity of the STG (Sarmiento et al., 2004;
Signorini and McClain, 2012) reduces the flow of energy to higher
trophic levels such as those of pelagic fish (Le Borgne et al., 2011). The
distribution and abundance of fisheries stocks such as tuna are also
sensitive to changes in sea temperature, and hence long-term variability
such as ENSO and PDO. The redistribution of tuna in the western central
equatorial region has been related to the position of the oceanic
convergence zones, where the warm pool meets the cooler tongue of
the Pacific. These changes have been reliably reproduced by population
models that use temperature as a driver of the distribution and abundance
of tuna (Lehodey et al, 1997, 2006). Projections of big-eye tuna (7, obesus)
distributions under SRES A2 show an improvement in spawning and
feeding habitats by 2100 in the eastern tropical Pacific and declines in
the western tropical Pacific, leading to an eastern displacement of tuna
stocks (Lehodey et al., 2008, 2010b).

of key pelagic fisheries such as skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis),
yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), big-eye tuna (7. obesus), and South
Pacific albacore tuna (7. alalunga), which make up the majority of key
fisheries in the Pacific Ocean. Changes in distribution and recruitment in
response to changes in sea temperature as result of ENSO demonstrate
the close association of pelagic fish stocks and water temperature. The
shift in habitat for top predators in the northeast Pacific was examined
by Hazen et al. (2012), who used tracking data from 23 marine species
and associated environmental variables to predict changes of up to 35%
in core habitat for these species within the North Pacific. Potential habitats
are predicted to contract for the blue whale, salmon shark, loggerhead
turtle, and blue and mako sharks, while potential habitats for the sooty
shearwater; black -footed albatross; leatherback turtle; white shark;
elephant seal; and albacore, bluefin and yellowfin tuna are predicted to
expand (Hazen et al., 2012). However, expansion of OMZs in the Pacific
STG is predicted to compress habitat (depth) for hypoxia-intolerant
species such as tuna (Stramma et al., 2010, 2012).

"Fisheries that exploit tuna and other large pelagic species are very
valuable to many small island states within the Indian Ocean. As with
Pacific fisheries, the distribution and abundance of large pelagic fish
in the Indian Ocean is greatly influenced by sea temperature. The
anomalously high sea temperatures of 1997-1998 (leading to a
deepening of the mixed layer in the west and a shoaling in the east)
coincided with anomalously low primary production in the Western
Indian Ocean and a major shift in tuna stocks (high confidence; Menard
et al., 2007; Robinson et al., 2010). Fishing grounds in the Western Indian
Ocean were deserted and fishing fleets underwent a massive shift toward
the eastern basin, which was unprecedented for the tuna fishery (high
confidence). As a result of these changes, many countries throughout
the Indian Ocean lost significant tuna-related revenue (Robinson et al.,
2010). In 2007, tuna fishing revenue was again reduced by strong
surface warming and deepening of the mixed layer, and associated with
a modest reduction in primary productivity in the west. These trends
highlight the overall vulnerability of tuna fishing countries in the Indian
Ocean to climate variability, a situation similar to that in the other major

conditions in 1998 varied between sub-regions, with the central Indian
Ocean islands (Maldives, Seychelles, Chagos, and Lakshadweep)

(from 40 to 53% coral cover in 1977-1997 to 7% in 1999-2000; high

southern India and Sri Lanka experienced similar decreases in coral cover

Indian Ocean (Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mayotte, Réunion, and

Recovery from these increases in mortality has been variable, with sites

mass coral bleaching and mortality becomes an annual risk under all

years by 2100 (virtually certain; Box CC-CR; Figures 30-10, SM30-3).
Coral-dominated reef ecosystems (areas with more than 30% coral

Warming is projected to continue (Table SM30-4), with substantial
increases in the vulnerability and risk associated with systems that have
been observed to change so far (high confidence; Figure 30-12). Under
RCP2.6, the temperatures of the STG are projected to increase by 0.17°C

"Understanding how storm frequency and intensity will change represents
a key question for many countries and territories within the various STG.
Projections of increasing sea temperature are /ikely to change the
behavior of tropical cyclones. At the same time, the maximum wind
speed and rainfall associated with cyclones is /ikely to increase, although
future trends in cyclones and severe storms are very likely to vary from
region to region (WGI ARS Section 14.6). Patterns such as “temporal
clustering” can have a strong influence on the impact of tropical cyclones
on ecosystems such as coral reefs (Mumby et al., 2011), although how
these patterns will change within all STG is uncertain at this point.
However, an intensifying hydrological cycle is expected to increase
precipitation in many areas (high confidence; WGI ARS Sections 2.5,
14.2), although longer droughts are also expected in other STG (medium
confidence). Changes in the hydrological cycle impact coastal ecosystems,
increasing damage through coastal flooding and physical damage from
storm waves (Mumby et al., 2011). Improving our understanding of how
weather systems associated with features such as the SPCZ (WGI AR5
Section 14.3.1) will vary is critical to climate change adaptation of a large
number of nations associated with the STG. Developing an understanding
of how ocean temperature, climate systems such as the SPCZ and ITCZ,
and climate change and variability (e.g., ENSO, PDO) interact will be
essential in this regard. For example, variability in the latitude of the
SPCZ is projected to increase, possibly leading to more extreme events
in Pacific Island countries (Cai et al., 2012).

"Assessments of the influence of climate change on the Deep Sea (DS)
are challenging because of difficulty of access and scarcity of long-term,
comprehensive observations (Smith, Jr. et al., 2009). The size of this habitat
is also vast, covering well over 54% of the Earth's surface and stretching
from the top of the mid-oceanic ridges to the bottom of deep ocean
trenches (Smith, Jr. et al., 2009). The fossil record in marine sediments
reveals that the DS has undergone large changes in response to climate
change in the past (Knoll and Fischer, 2011). The paleo-skeletal record
shows that it is the rate, not just the magnitude, of climate change
(temperature, 0,, and CO,) that is critical to marine life in DS. The current
rate of change in key parameters very likely exceeds that of other major
events in Earth history. Two primary time scales are of interest. The first
is the slow rate (century-scale) of ocean circulation and mixing, and
consequently the slow rate at which DS ecosystems experience physical
climate change. The second is the rapid rate at which organic matter
enters the deep ocean from primary productivity generated at the surface
of the Ocean, which represents a critical food supply to DS animals
(Smith, Jr and Kaufmann, 1999; Smith, Jr. et al, 2009). It can also represent
a potential risk in some circumstances where the flux of organic carbon
into the deep ocean, coupled with increased sea temperatures, can lead
to anoxic areas (dead zones) as metabolism is increased and O, decreased
(Chan et al., 2008; Stramma et al., 2010).

"The greatest rate of change of temperature is occurring in the upper 700
m of the Ocean (very high confidence; WGI ARS Section 3.2), although
smaller yet significant changes are occurring at depth. The DS environment
is typically cold (~-0.5°C to 3°C; Smith et al., 2008), although abyssal
temperatures in the SES can be higher (e.g., Mediterranean DS ~12°C;
Danovaro et al., 2010). In the latter case, DS organisms can thrive in these
environments as well, illustrating the variety of temperature conditions
that differing species of abyssal life have adapted to. Individual species,
however, are typically constrained within a narrow thermal and 0,-
demand window of tolerance (Portner, 2010) and therefore it is likely
that shifts in the distribution of DS species and regional extinctions will
occur. Warming over multiple decades has been observed below 700 m
(Levitus et al., 2005, 2009), with warming being minimal at mid-range
depths (2000 to 3000 m), and increasing toward the sea floor in some
sub-regions (e.g., Southern Ocean; WGI AR5 Chapter 3). For the deep
Atlantic Ocean, the mean age of deep waters (mean time since last
exposure to the atmosphere) is approximately 250 years; the oldest deep
waters of the Pacific Ocean are >1000 years old. The patterns of ocean
circulation are clearly revealed by the penetration of tracers and the
signal of CO, released from burning fossil fuel penetrating into the abyss
(Sabine et al., 2004). It will take many centuries for full equilibration of
deep ocean waters and their ecosystems with recent planetary warming
and CO, levels (Wunsch and Heimbach, 2008).

the Ocean. Many of these services are provided by coastal and shelf
areas, and are consequently addressed in other chapters (e.g., Sections
5.4.3, 7.3.2.4, 22.3.2.3). Oceans contribute provisioning (e.g., food, raw

recycling, carbon storage, climate regulation, water flux), supporting
(e.g., habitat, genetic diversity), and cultural (e.g., recreational, religious)

The influences of climate change on Ocean sectors will be mediated

Environmental changes can therefore impact farm profitability, depending

"The Ocean provided 64% of the production supplied by world fisheries
(capture and aquaculture) in 2010, amounting to 148.5 million tonnes
of fish and shellfish (FAO, 2012). This production, valued at US$217.5
billion, supplied, on average, 18.6 kg of protein-rich food per person
to an estimated population of 6.9 billion (FAO, 2012). Marine capture
fisheries supplied 77.4 million tonnes with highest production from the
northwest Pacific (27%), west-central Pacific (15%), northeast Atlantic
(11%), and southeast Pacific (10%) (FAO, 2012). World aquaculture
production (59.9 million tonnes in 2010) is dominated by freshwater
fishes; nevertheless, marine aquaculture supplied 18.1 million tonnes

"Fisheries, in particular shellfish, are also vulnerable to declining pH
and carbonate ion concentrations. As a result, the global production of
shellfish fisheries is likely to decrease (Cooley and Doney, 2009; Pickering
et al., 2011) with further ocean acidification (medium confidence;
Sections 6.3.2, 6.3.5, 6.4.1.1; Box CC-OA). Impacts may be first observed
in EBUE where upwelled water is already relatively low in 0, and under-
saturated with aragonite (Section 30.5.5). Seasonal upwelling of
acidified waters onto the continental shelf in the California Current
region has recently affected oyster hatcheries along the coast of
Washington and Oregon (Barton et al., 2012; Section 30.5.5.1.1). Whether
declining pH and aragonite saturation due to climate change played a
role is unclear; however, future declines will increase the risk of such
events occurring.

"Marine capture fisheries production increased from 16.8 million tonnes
in 1950 to a peak of 86.4 million tonnes in 1996, then declined before
stabilizing around 80 million tonnes (FAO, 2012). The stagnation of marine
capture fisheries production is attributed to full exploitation of around
60% of the world’s marine fisheries and overexploitation of 30%
(estimates for 2009) (FAO, 2012). Major issues for industrial fisheries
include illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing; ineffective
implementation of monitoring, control, and surveillance; and overcapacity
in fishing fleets (World Bank and FAO, 2008; FAO, 2012). Such problems
are being progressively addressed in several developed and developing
countries (Hilborn, 2007; Pitcher et al., 2009; Worm et al., 2009), where
investments have been made in stock assessment, strong management,
and application of the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries

large numbers of politically weak fishers operating from decentralized
localities, with poor governance and insufficient data to monitor catches
effectively (Kurien and Willmann, 2009; Cochrane et al., 2011; Pomeroy
and Andrew, 2011). For these SSF, management that aims to avoid
further depletion of overfished stocks may be more appropriate in
the short-term than management aimed at maximizing sustainable
production. These aims are achieved through adaptive management by
(1) introduction of harvest controls (e.g., size limits, closed seasons and
areas, gear restrictions, and protection of spawning aggregations) to
avoid irreversible damage to stocks in the face of uncertainty (Cochrane
et al., 2011); (2) flexible modification of these controls through
monitoring (Plaganyi et al., 2013); and (3) investing in the social capital

new challenges for fisheries resulting in loss of coastal and oceanic
habitat (Hazen et al., 2012; Stramma et al., 2012), the movement of
species (Cheung et al., 2011), the spread and increase of disease and
invading species (Ling, 2008; Raitsos et al., 2010; Chan et al., 2011),

medium evidence and medium agreement that these changes will
change both the nature of fisheries and their ability to provide food and
protein for hundreds of millions of people (Section 7.2.1.2). The risks to
ecosystems and fisheries vary from region to region (Section 7.3.2.4).
Dynamic bioclimatic envelope models under SRES A1B project potential
increases in fisheries production at high latitudes, and potential
decreases at lower latitudes by the mid-21st century (Cheung et al.,
2010; Section 6.5). Overall, warming temperatures are projected to shift
optimal environments for individual species polewards and redistribute

only liberates much of the carbon associated with vegetation loss, but
can also release and oxidize buried organic carbon through erosion of
cleared coastlines (high confidence; Duarte et al., 2005). Combining
data on global area, land use conversion rates, and near-surface carbon
stocks for marshes, mangroves, and seagrass meadows, Pendleton et
al. (2012) revealed that the CO, emissions arising from destruction of
these three ecosystems was equivalent to 3 to 19% of the emissions
generated by deforestation globally, with economic damages estimated
to be US$6 to US$42 billion annually. Similarly, Luisetti et al. (2013)
estimate the carbon stock of seagrass and salt marshes in Europe,
representing less than 4% of global carbon stocks in coastal vegetation,
was valued at US$180 million, at EU Allowance price of €8/tCO, in June
2012.A reversal of EU Environmental Protection Directives could result
in economic losses of US$1 billion by 2060. Blue Carbon strategies can
also be justified in light of the numerous ecosystem services these
ecosystems provide, such as protection against coastal erosion and
storm damage, and provision of habitats for fisheries species (Section

fisheries that tend to operate at family or community level, have low
levels of capitalization, and make an important contribution to food
security and livelihoods. They are often dependent on coastal ecosystems,
such as coral reefs, that provide habitats for a wide range of harvested
fish and invertebrate species. Despite their importance to many developing
countries, such ecosystems are under serious pressure from human
activities including deteriorating coastal water quality, sedimentation,
ocean warming, overfishing, and acidification (Sections 7.2.1.2, 30.3,

"The challenges of optimizing the economic and social benefits of both
industrial fisheries and SSF and aquaculture operations, which often

and capitalize on the opportunities (Pecl et al., 2009; Bell et al., 2013b;

"Fisheries for skipjack, yellowfin, big-eye, and albacore tuna provide
substantial economic and social benefits to the people of Small Island
Developing States (SIDS). For example, tuna fishing license fees
contribute substantially (up to 40%) to the government revenue of
several Pacific Island nations (Gillett, 2009; Bell et al., 2013b). Tuna
fishing and processing operations also contribute up to 25% of gross
domestic product in some of these nations and employ more than
12,000 people (Gillett, 2009; Bell et al., 2013b). Considerable economic
benefits are also derived from fisheries for top pelagic predators in the
Indian and Atlantic Oceans (FAO, 2012; Bell et al, 2013a). Increasing
sea temperatures and changing patterns of upwelling are projected to
cause shifts in the distribution and abundance of pelagic top predator
fish stocks (Sections 30.5.2, 30.5.5-6), with potential to create “winners”
and “losers” among island economies as catches of the transboundary
tuna stocks change among and within their exclusive economic zones

"Aquaculture production is expanding rapidly (Bostock et al., 2010) and
will play an important role in food production and livelihoods as the
human demand for protein grows. This may also add pressure on
capture fisheries (FAO, 2012; Merino et al., 2012). Two-thirds of farmed
food fish production (marine and freshwater) is achieved with the use
of feed derived from wild-harvested, small, pelagic fish and shellfish.
Fluctuations in the availability and price of fishmeal and fish oil for
feeds, as well as their availability, pose challenges for the growth of
sustainable aquaculture production, particularly given uncertainties in
changes in EBUE upwelling dynamics to climate change (Section
30.5.5). Technological advances and changes in management such as
increasing feed efficiencies, using alternatives to fishmeal and fish oil,
and farming of herbivorous finfish, coupled with economic and regulatory
incentives, will reduce the vulnerability of aquaculture to the impacts
of climate change on small, pelagic fish abundance (Naylor et al., 2009;

(1) full implementation of the regional “vessel day scheme,” designed to
distribute the economic benefits from the resource in the face of climatic
variability, and other schemes to control fishing effort in subtropical

programs to assist domestic fleets to cope with increasing fuel costs
and the possible need to fish further from port; and (5) the eventual
restructuring of regional fisheries management organizations to help
coordinate management measures across the entire tropical Pacific.
Efforts to ensure provision of operational-level catch and effort data
from all industrial fishing operations will improve models for projecting
redistribution of tuna stocks and quotas under climate change (Nicol

temperature (Belkin, 2009; Sherman et al., 2009), there has been an
increase in the size of fish stocks associated with high-latitude fisheries
in the Northern Hemisphere. This is particularly the case for the Norwegian
spring-spawning herring, which has recovered from near-extinction as a
result of overfishing and a cooler climate during the 1960s (Toresen and
Qstvedt, 2000). The major components of both pelagic and demersal
high-latitude fish stocks are boreal species located north of 50°N.
Climate change is projected to increase high-latitude plankton production
and displace zooplankton and fish species poleward. As a combined
result of these future changes, the abundance of fish (particularly boreal

of locations and the opportunities for tourism through their influence
on the movement of organisms and the state of ecosystems such as
coral reefs (Section 10.6.2; Box CC-CR; UNWTO and UNEP, 2008). Mass
coral bleaching and mortality (triggered by elevated sea temperatures;
high confidence) can decrease the appeal of destinations for diving-
related tourism, although the level of awareness of tourists of impacts
(e.g., <50% of tourists were concerned about coral bleaching during a
major bleaching year, 1998) and expected economic impacts have been
found to be uncertain (Scott et al., 2012b). Some studies, however, have
noted reduced tourist satisfaction and identified “dead coral” as one
of the reasons for disappointment at the end of the holiday (Westmacott
et al., 2000). Tourists respond to changes in factors such as weather and
opportunity by expressing different preferences. For example, preferred
conditions and hence tourism are projected to shift toward higher
latitudes with climate change, or from summer to cooler seasons
(Amelung et al., 2007; Section 10.6.1).

"The changes in distribution and migration of pelagic fish shows
considerable spatial and temporal variability, which can increase tensions
among fishing nations. In this regard, tension over the Atlantic mackerel
fisheries has led to what many consider the first climate change-related
conflict between fishing nations (Cheung et al., 2012; Section 30.6.5),
and which has emphasized the importance of developing international
collaboration and frameworks for decision making (Miller et al., 2013;
Sections 15.4.3.3, 30.6.7). The Atlantic mackerel has over the recent
decades been a shared stock between the EU and Norway. However,
the recent advancement of the Atlantic mackerel into the Icelandic EEZ
during summer has resulted in Icelandic fishers operating outside the
agreement between the EU and Norway. Earlier records of mackerel
from the first half of the 20th and second half of the 19th century show,
however, that mackerel was present in Icelandic waters during the
earlier warm periods (Astthorsson et al., 2012). In the Barents Sea, the
northeast Arctic cod, Gadus morhua, reached record-high abundance
in 2012 and also reached its northernmost-recorded distribution (82°N)
(ICES, 2012). A further northward migration is impossible as this would
be into the Deep Sea Polar Basin, beyond the habitat of shelf species.
A further advancement eastwards to the Siberian shelf is, however,
possible. The northeast Arctic cod stock is shared exclusively by Norway
and Russia, and to date there has been a good agreement between
those two nations on the management of the stock. These examples
highlight the importance of international agreements and cooperation
(Table 30-4).

which is /ikely to increase given that future storm systems are expected

Knutson et al., 2010). Events such as Hurricane Katrina have illustrated
challenges which will arise for this industry with projected increases in
storm intensity (Cruz and Krausmann, 2008). In this regard, early
warning systems and integrated planning offer some potential to reduce
the effect of extreme events (IPCC, 2012).

Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. Other consequences for oil
pipelines and production facilities ultimately reduced US refining
capacity by 20% (IPCC, 2012). The increasing demand for oil and gas
has pushed operations to waters 2000 m deep or more, far beyond
continental shelves. The very large-scale moored developments required
are exposed to greater hazards and higher risks, most of which are not
well understood by existing climate/weather projections. Although there

wells, manifolds, and pipes that are not exposed to surface forcing,
these systems face different hazards from instability and scouring of
the unconsolidated sediments by DS currents (Randolph et al., 2010).
The influence of warming oceans on sea floor stability is widely debated
due largely to uncertainties about the effects of methane and methane
hydrates (Sultan et al., 2004; Archer et al., 2009; Geresi et al., 2009).
Declining sea ice is also opening up the Arctic to further oil and gas

its use (Schoyen and Brathen, 2011), and the potential full operation of
the Northwest Passage and Northern Sea Route would require a transit

WGIII ARS Section 8.1). Changes in shipping routes (Borgerson, 2008)
and variation in the transport network due to shifts in grain production
and global markets, as well as new fuel and weather-monitoring
technology, may alter these emission patterns (WGIII AR5 Sections 8.3,

interrupt ports and transport routes more frequently, damaging
infrastructure and introducing additional dangers to ships, crews, and
the environment (UNCTAD, 2009a,b; Pinnegar et al., 2012; Section

"Major threats to public health due to climate change include diminished
security of water and food supplies, extreme weather events, and
changes in the distribution and severity of diseases, including those due
to marine biotoxins (Costello et al., 2009; Sections 5.4.3.5, 6.4.2.3, 11.2).
The predominantly negative impacts of disease for human communities
are expected to be more serious in low-income areas such as Southeast
Asia, southern and east Africa, and various sub-regions of South America
(Patz et al., 2005), which also have under-resourced health systems
(Costello et al., 2009). Many of the influences are directly or indirectly
related to basin-scale changes in the Ocean (e.g., temperature, rainfall,
plankton populations, SLR, and ocean circulation; McMichael et al.,
2006). Climate change in the Ocean may influence the distribution of
diseases such as cholera (Section 11.5.2.1), and the distribution and
occurrence of HABs. The frequency of cholera outbreaks induced by
Vibrio cholerae and other enteric pathogens are correlated with sea
surface temperatures, multi-decadal fluctuations of ENSO, and plankton
blooms, which may provide insight into how this disease may change
with projected rates of ocean warming (Colwell, 1996; Pascual et al.,
2000; Rod6 et al., 2002; Patz et al., 2005; Myers and Patz, 2009; Baker-
Austin et al., 2012). The incidence of diseases such as ciguatera also
shows links to ENSO, with ciguatera becoming more prominent after
periods of elevated sea temperature. This indicates that ciguatera may
become more frequent in a warmer climate (Llewellyn, 2010), particularly
given the higher prevalence of ciguatera in areas with degraded coral
reefs (low confidence; Pratchett et al., 2011a).

offshore wind turbines (Section 10.2.2). At present, there is high
uncertainty about how changes in wind intensity and patterns, and
extreme events (from climate change), will impact the offshore wind

sequestration from co-produced CO, into sub-sea geologic formations is

Brazil. These activities will increase as offshore oil and gas production
increasingly exploits fields with high CO, in the source gas and oil.
Significant risks from the injection of high levels of CO, into deep ocean

chronic effects have not yet been studied. These risks are similar to those

coastlines, human communities, resource access, and new seaways

been clearly defined in all cases, it is possible that changes in the Ocean
as result of climate change will increase pressure on resources aimed
at maintaining maritime security and countering criminal activity,

National maritime security capacity and infrastructure may also require

"Evidence that human activities are fundamentally changing the Ocean
is virtually certain. Sea temperatures have increased rapidly over the
past 60 years at the same time as pH has declined, consistent with the
expected influence of rising atmospheric concentrations of CO, and
other GHGs (very high confidence). The rapid rate at which these
fundamental physical and chemical parameters of the Ocean are
changing is unprecedented within the last 65 Ma (high confidence) and
possibly 300 Ma (medium confidence). As the heat content of the
Ocean has increased, the Ocean has become more stratified (very likely),
although there is considerable regional variability. In some cases,
changing surface wind has influenced the extent of mixing and upwelling,
although our understanding of where and why these differences occur
regionally is uncertain. The changing structure and function of the
Ocean has led to changes in parameters such as O,, carbonate ion, and
inorganic nutrient concentrations (high confidence). Not surprisingly,
these fundamental changes have resulted in responses by key marine
organisms, ecosystems, and ecological processes, with negative
implications for hundreds of millions of people that depend on the
ecosystem goods and services provided (very likely). Marine organisms
are migrating at rapid rates toward higher latitudes, fisheries are
transforming, and many organisms are shifting their reproductive and
migratory activity in time and in concert with changes in temperature
and other parameters. Ecosystems such as coral reefs are declining
rapidly (high confidence). An extensive discussion of these changes is

assessment of the literature and expert judgments made by authors of the various WGII ARS chapters, with supporting evaluation of evidence and agreement in the referenced
chapter sections. Each key risk is characterized as very low, low, medium, high, or very high. Risk levels are presented for the near-term era of committed climate change (here,
for 2030-2040), in which projected levels of global mean temperature increase do not diverge substantially across emissions scenarios. Risk levels are also presented for the
longer term era of climate options (here, for 2080-2100), for global mean temperature increases of 2°C and 4°C above pre-industrial levels. For each time frame, risk levels are
estimated for the current state of adaptation and for a hypothetical highly adapted state. As the assessment considers potential impacts on different physical, biological, and
human systems, risk levels should not necessarily be used to evaluate relative risk across key risks. Relevant climate variables are indicated by symbols.

to increasing levels of stress may not occur fast enough given fairly long
generation times of organisms such as reef-building corals and many
other invertebrates and fish (Table 30-3). In this case, risks may be
reduced by addressing stresses not related to climate change (e.g.,
pollution, overfishing), although this strategy could have minimal

FAQ 30.5 | How can we use non-climate factors to manage
climate change impacts on the oceans?
"	Title
"coral reefs, Halimeda beds), increasing ocean acidification puts at risk
ecosystems services that are critical for hundreds of thousands of
marine species, plus people and industries, particularly within CBS, STG,
and SES (high confidence). Further risks may emerge from the non-
linear interaction of different factors (e.g., increasing ocean temperature
may amplify effects of ocean acidification, and vice versa) and via the
interaction of local stressors with climate change (e.g., interacting
changes may lead to greater ecosystems disturbances than each impact
on its own). There is an urgent need to understand these types of
interactions and impacts, especially given the long time it will take to
return ocean ecosystems to preindustrial pH and carbonate chemistry
(ie., tens of thousands of years (FAQ 30.1) should CO, emissions continue
at the current rate).

"at risk, particularly in EBUE (e.g., California and Humboldt Current
ecosystems; Section 30.5.5), SES (e.g., Baltic and Black Seas; Section
30.5.3), and CBS (e.g., Gulf of Mexico, northeast Indian Ocean; Sections
30.3.2.3, 30.5.4). It is very likely that the warming of surface waters has
also increased the stratification of the upper ocean by about 4% between
0 and 200 m from 1971 to 2010 in all oceans north of about 40°S. In
many cases, there is significant adaptation opportunity to reduce
hypoxia locally by reducing the flow of organic carbon, hence microbial
activity, within these coastal systems (Section 30.5.4). Relocating fishing
effort, and modifying procedures associated with industries such as
aquaculture, may offer some opportunity to adapt to these changes
(likely). Declining 0, concentrations are likely to have significant impacts
on DS habitats, where organisms are relatively sensitive to environmental
changes of this nature owing to the very constant conditions under
which they have evolved (Section 30.5.7).
"	Text
"The Ocean is exposed to a range of stresses that may or may not be related to climate change. Human activities
can result in pollution, eutrophication (too many nutrients), habitat destruction, invasive species, destructive fishing,
and over-exploitation of marine resources. Sometimes, these activities can increase the impacts of climate change,
although they can, in a few circumstances, dampen the effects as well. Understanding how these factors interact
with climate change and ocean acidification is important in its own right. However, reducing the impact of these
non-climate factors may reduce the overall rate of change within ocean ecosystems. Building ecological resilience
through ecosystem-based approaches to the management of the marine environment, for example, may pay dividends
in terms of reducing and delaying the effects of climate change (high confidence).
"	Text
"Ocean acidification has increased the vulnerability of ocean ecosystems
by affecting key aspects of the physiology and ecology of marine
organisms (particularly in CBS, STG, and SES; Section 6.3.2; Table 30-3;
Box CC-OA). Decreasing pH and carbonate ion concentrations reduce
the ability of marine organisms to produce shells and skeletons, and
may interfere with a range of biological processes such as reproduction,
gas exchange, metabolism, navigation ability, and neural function in a
broad range of marine organisms that show minor to major influences of
ocean acidification on their biology (Sections 6.3.2, 30.3.2.2; Box CC-OA).
Natural variability in ocean pH can interact with ocean acidification to
create damaging periods of extremes (i.e, high CO,, low O, and pH),
which can have a strong effect on coastal activities such as aquaculture
(medium confidence; Section 6.2; Figure 30-12 A; Box CC-UP). There may
be opportunity to adapt aquaculture to increasingly acidic conditions
by monitoring natural variability and restricting water intake to periods
of optimal conditions. Reducing other non-climate change or ocean
acidification associated stresses also represents an opportunity to build
greater ecological resilience against the impacts of changing ocean
carbonate chemistry. Ocean acidification is also an emerging risk for
DS habitats as CO, continues to penetrate the Ocean, although the
impacts and adaptation options are poorly understood and explored.
Ocean acidification has heightened importance for some groups of
organisms and ecosystems (Box CC-OA). In ecosystems that are heavily
dependent on the accumulation of calcium carbonate over time (e.g.,
"	Text
"It is very likely that surface warming has increased stratification of
the upper ocean, contributing to the decrease in 0, along with the
temperature-related decreases in oxygen solubility (WGI AR5 Section
3.8.3). Changes to wind speed, wave height, and storm intensity influence
the location and rate of mixing within the upper layers of the Ocean
and hence the concentration of inorganic nutrients (e.g., in EBUE, EUS;
Figure 30-12 1,3). These changes to ocean structure increase the risks and
vulnerability of food webs within the Ocean. However, our understanding
of how primary productivity is going to change in a warming and more
acidified ocean is limited, as is our understanding of how upwelling will
respond to changing surface wind as the world continues to warm
(Boxes CC-PP, CC-UP). As already discussed, these types of changes can
have implications for the supply of 0, into the Ocean and the upward
transport of inorganic nutrients to the euphotic zone. Although our
understanding is limited, there is significant potential for regional increases
in wind speed to result in greater rates of upwelling and the supply of
inorganic nutrients to the photic zone. Although this may increase
productivity of phytoplankton communities and associated fisheries,
greater rates of upwelling can increase the risk of hypoxic conditions
developing at depth as excess primary production sinks into the Ocean
and stimulates microbial activity at depth (Sections 6.1.1.3, 30.3.2.3,
30.5.5; Table 30-3). Changes in storm intensity may increase the risk of
damage to shipping and industrial infrastructure, which increases the risk
of accidents and delays to the transport of products between countries,
security operations, and the extraction of minerals from coastal and
oceanic areas (Section 30.6.2; IPCC, 2012).

the processes that lead to persistent range shifts, and a focus on
the ecosystem, social, and economic implications of range shifts is an
important research need.

"expansion of “dead zones” (Sections 30.3.2, 30.5.2-4). Understanding
surface wind in a warming climate will also yield important information
on surface mixing as well as how surface wave height might also vary,
improving our understanding of potential interactions in coastal areas
between wind, waves, and SLR (Section 30.3.1). Given the importance
of mixing and upwelling to the supply of inorganic nutrients to the
surface layers of the ocean, understanding these important phenomena
at the ocean-atmosphere interface will provide important insight into
how ocean warming and acidification are likely to impact ecosystems,
food webs, and ultimately important fisheries such as those found along
the west coasts of Africa and the Americas.

"Understanding cumulative and synergistic impacts is poorly developed
for ocean systems. Much of our understanding has been built on
experimental approaches that are focused on single stressors that
respond gradually without interaction or impacts that accumulate over
time (Table 30-3). Multifactorial experiments exploring the impact of
combined variables (e.g., elevated temperature and acidification at the
same time) will enable more realistic projections of the future to be
established. Equally, developing a better understanding of how biological
and ecological responses change in relation to key environmental
variables should also be a goal of future research. In this regard,
assumptions that responses are likely to be gradual and linear over
time ultimately have little basis, yet are widespread within the scientific
literature.

"Oceanic phytoplankton are responsible for approximately 50% of global
net primary productivity. However, our understanding of how oceanic
primary production is likely to change in a warmer and more acidified
ocean is uncertain (Boxes CC-PP, CC-UP). Changes in net primary
productivity will resonate through food webs and ultimately affect
fisheries production. Given the central role that primary producers and
their associated ecological processes play in ocean ecosystem functioning,
the understanding of how net primary productivity is likely to vary at
global and regional levels is improved (Sections 30.5.2, 30.5.5). At the
same time, understanding how plankton communities will vary spatially
and temporarily will be important in any attempt to understand how fish
populations will fare in a warmer and more acidified ocean. The research
challenge is to determine when and where net primary production is
expected to change, coupled with research on adaptation strategies for
coping with the changes to the global distribution of seafood procurement,
management, and food security.

"The declining level of 0, in the Ocean is an emerging issue of major
importance (Section 30.3.2). Developing a better understanding of the
role and temperature sensitivity of microbial systems in determining O,
concentrations will enable a more coherent understanding of the changes
and potential risks to marine ecosystems. Given the importance of
microbial systems to the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics
of the Ocean, it is extremely important that these systems receive
greater focus, especially with regard to their response to ocean warming
and acidification. This is particularly important for the DS (>1000 m),
which is the most extensive habitat on the planet. In this respect,
increasing our understanding of DS habitats and how they may be
changing under the influence of climate change and ocean acidification
is of great importance. Linkages between changes occurring in the surface
layers and those associated with the DS are particularly important in
light of our need to understand how rapidly changes are occurring and
what the implications are for the metabolic activity and 0, content of
DS habitats.

"The rapid and largely unprecedented changes to ocean acidification
represent an emerging issue given the central importance of pH and
the concentration of ions such as carbonate in the biology of marine
organisms (Box CC-OA). Despite the relatively short history of research
on this issue, there are already a large number of laboratory and field
studies that demonstrate a large range of effects across organisms,
processes, and ecosystems. Key gaps (Gattuso et al., 2011) remain in
our understanding of how ocean acidification will interact with other
changes in the Ocean, and whether or not biological responses to ocean
acidification are necessarily linear. The vulnerability of fishery species
(e.g., molluscs) to ocean acidification represents an emerging issue, with
a need for research to understand and develop strategies for fishery
and aquaculture industries to minimize the impacts. Understanding of
how carbonate structures such as coral reefs and Halimeda beds will
respond to a rapidly acidifying ocean represents a key gap and research
need, especially in understanding the rate at which consolidated
carbonate structures and related habitats are likely to erode and dissolve.
Interactions between ocean acidification, upwelling, and decreasing O,
represent additional areas of concern and research. There is also a need
to improve our understanding of the socioeconomic ramifications of
ocean acidification (Turley and Boot, 2011; Hilmi et al., 2013).

"Many communities depend on marine ecosystems for food and income
yet our understanding of the consequences of environmental degradation
is poor. For example, although there is high confidence that coral reefs
will continue to deteriorate at current rates of climate change and ocean
acidification (Gardner et al., 2003; Bruno and Selig, 2007; De'ath et al.,
2012), there is relatively poor understanding of the implications for the
hundreds of millions of people who depend on these important coastal
ecosystems for food and livelihoods. Improving our understanding of
how to reinforce socio-ecological resilience in communities affected by
the deterioration of key coastal and oceanic ecosystems is central to
developing effective adaptation responses to these growing challenges
(Section 30.6, Tables 30-3, 30-4).

"webs (virtually certain; Hoegh-Guldberg and Bruno, 2010; Poloczanska
et al., 2013; Box CC-MB). One of the inevitable outcomes of differing
tolerances and responses to climate change and ocean acidification is the
development of novel assemblages of organisms in the near future. Such
communities are likely to have no past or contemporary counterparts,
and will consequently require new strategies for managing coastal
areas and fisheries. Changes to a wide array of factors related or not
related to climate change have the potential to drive extremely complex
changes in community structure and, consequently, food web dynamics.
Developing a greater capability for detecting and understanding these
changes will be critical for future management of ocean and coastal
resources.

Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the average weather, or

variability of relevant quantities over a period of time ranging from months
to thousands or millions of years. The classical period for averaging
these variables is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological

An interaction in which a perturbation in one climate quantity causes
a change in a second, and the change in the second quantity ultimately
leads to an additional change in the first. A negative feedback is one in
which the initial perturbation is weakened by the changes it causes; a
positive feedback is one in which the initial perturbation is enhanced.
In this Assessment Report, a somewhat narrower definition is often
used in which the climate quantity that is perturbed is the global mean
surface temperature, which in turn causes changes in the global
radiation budget. In either case, the initial perturbation can either be
externally forced or arise as part of internal variability.

that the Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in its
Article 1, defines climate change as: “a change of climate which is
attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the
composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to
natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods.” The
UNFCCC thus makes a distinction between climate change attributable
to human activities altering the atmospheric composition, and climate
variability attributable to natural causes. See also Climate change

cryosphere and land surfaces, the climate would continue to change
even if the atmospheric composition were held fixed at today’s values.
Past change in atmospheric composition leads to a committed climate
change, which continues for as long as a radiative imbalance persists
and until all components of the climate system have adjusted to a new
state. The further change in temperature after the composition of the
atmosphere is held constant is referred to as the constant composition
temperature commitment or simply committed warming or warming
commitment. Climate change commitment includes other future
changes, for example, in the hydrological cycle, in extreme weather
events, in extreme climate events, and in sea level change. The constant
emission commitment is the committed climate change that would
result from keeping anthropogenic emissions constant and the zero
emission commitment is the climate change commitment when emissions
are set to zero. See also Climate change.

A climate projection is the simulated response of the climate system to
a scenario of future emission or concentration of greenhouse gases and

A period of abnormally dry weather long enough to cause a serious
hydrological imbalance. Drought is a relative term; therefore any
discussion in terms of precipitation deficit must refer to the particular
precipitation-related activity that is under discussion. For example,
shortage of precipitation during the growing season impinges on crop
production or ecosystem function in general (due to soil moisture
drought, also termed agricultural drought), and during the runoff and
percolation season primarily affects water supplies (hydrological drought).
Storage changes in soil moisture and groundwater are also affected
by increases in actual evapotranspiration in addition to reductions in
precipitation. A period with an abnormal precipitation deficit is defined
as a meteorological drought. A megadrought is a very lengthy and
pervasive drought, lasting much longer than normal, usually a decade
or more. For the corresponding indices, see WGI ARS Box 2.4.

The term El Nifio was initially used to describe a warm-water current
that periodically flows along the coast of Ecuador and Peru, disrupting
the local fishery. It has since become identified with a basin-wide
warming of the tropical Pacific Ocean east of the dateline. This oceanic
event is associated with a fluctuation of a global-scale tropical and
subtropical surface pressure pattern called the Southern Oscillation. This
coupled atmosphere-ocean phenomenon, with preferred time scales of
2 to about 7 years, is known as the El Nifio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO).
It is often measured by the surface pressure anomaly difference between
Tahiti and Darwin or the sea surface temperatures in the central and
eastern equatorial Pacific. During an ENSO event, the prevailing trade
winds weaken, reducing upwelling and altering ocean currents such that
the sea surface temperatures warm, further weakening the trade winds.
This event has a great impact on the wind, sea surface temperature,
and precipitation patterns in the tropical Pacific. It has climatic effects
throughout the Pacific region and in many other parts of the world,
through global teleconnections. The cold phase of ENSO is called La
Nifia. For the corresponding indices, see WGI ARS Box 2.5.

Geoengineering refers to a broad set of methods and technologies that
aim to deliberately alter the climate system in order to alleviate the
impacts of climate change. Most, but not all, methods seek to either
(1) reduce the amount of absorbed solar energy in the climate system
(Solar Radiation Management) or (2) increase net carbon sinks from
the atmosphere at a scale sufficiently large to alter climate (Carbon
Dioxide Removal). Scale and intent are of central importance. Two key
characteristics of geoengineering methods of particular concern are that
they use or affect the climate system (e.g., atmosphere, land, or ocean)
globally or regionally and/or could have substantive unintended effects
that cross national boundaries. Geoengineering is different from weather
modification and ecological engineering, but the boundary can be fuzzy
(IPCC, 2012b, p. 2).

Greenhouse gases are those gaseous constituents of the atmosphere,
both natural and anthropogenic, that absorb and emit radiation at
specific wavelengths within the spectrum of terrestrial radiation emitted
by the Earth's surface, the atmosphere itself, and clouds. This property
causes the greenhouse effect. Water vapor (H,0), carbon dioxide (CO,),
nitrous oxide (N,O), methane (CH,), and ozone (03) are the primary
greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere. Moreover, there are a
number of entirely human-made greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,
such as the halocarbons and other chlorine- and bromine-containing
substances, dealt with under the Montreal Protocol. Beside CO,, N,0,
and CH,, the Kyoto Protocol deals with the greenhouse gases sulfur
hexafluoride (SF,), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and perfluorocarbons
(PFCs). For a list of well-mixed greenhouse gases, see WGI ARS Table
2.5M.1.

The infrared radiative effect of all infrared-absorbing constituents in the
atmosphere. Greenhouse gases, clouds, and (to a small extent) aerosols
absorb terrestrial radiation emitted by the Earth’s surface and elsewhere
in the atmosphere. These substances emit infrared radiation in all
directions, but, everything else being equal, the net amount emitted to
space is normally less than would have been emitted in the absence of
these absorbers because of the decline of temperature with altitude
in the troposphere and the consequent weakening of emission. An
increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases increases the
magnitude of this effect; the difference is sometimes called the enhanced
greenhouse effect. The change in a greenhouse gas concentration
because of anthropogenic emissions contributes to an instantaneous
radiative forcing. Surface temperature and troposphere warm in
response to this forcing, gradually restoring the radiative balance at
the top of the atmosphere.

Poverty trap is understood differently across disciplines. In the social
sciences, the concept, primarily employed at the individual, household,
or community level, describes a situation in which escaping poverty
becomes impossible due to unproductive or inflexible resources. A
poverty trap can also be seen as a critical minimum asset threshold,
below which families are unable to successfully educate their children,
build up their productive assets, and get out of poverty. Extreme poverty
is itself a poverty trap, since poor persons lack the means to participate
meaningfully in society. In economics, the term poverty trap is often
used at national scales, referring to a self-perpetuating condition
where an economy, caught in a vicious cycle, suffers from persistent
underdevelopment (Matsuyama, 2008). Many proposed models of
poverty traps are found in the literature.

related variations back in time. Climate-related data derived in this way
are referred to as proxy data. Examples of proxies include pollen analysis,
tree ring records, speleothems, characteristics of corals, and various data
derived from marine sediments and ice cores. Proxy data can be calibrated

Reanalyses are estimates of historical atmospheric temperature and

created by processing past meteorological or oceanographic data using
fixed state-of-the-art weather forecasting or ocean circulation models

effects from the changing analysis system that occur in operational
analyses. Although continuity is improved, global reanalyses still suffer
from changing coverage and biases in the observing systems.

Scenarios that include time series of emissions and concentrations of
the full suite of greenhouse gases and aerosols and chemically active
gases, as well as land use/land cover (Moss et al., 2008). The word
representative signifies that each RCP provides only one of many
possible scenarios that would lead to the specific radiative forcing
characteristics. The term pathway emphasizes that not only the long-

Radiative forcing is the change in the net, downward minus upward,
radiative flux (expressed in W m~) at the tropopause or top of atmosphere
due to a change in an external driver of climate change, such as a
change in the concentration of carbon dioxide or the output of the Sun.
Sometimes internal drivers are still treated as forcings even though they
result from the alteration in climate, for example aerosol or greenhouse
gas changes in paleoclimates. The traditional radiative forcing is computed
with all tropospheric properties held fixed at their unperturbed values,
and after allowing for stratospheric temperatures, if perturbed, to
readjust to radiative-dynamical equilibrium. Radiative forcing is called
instantaneous if no change in stratospheric temperature is accounted
for. The radiative forcing once rapid adjustments are accounted for is
termed the effective radiative forcing. For the purposes of this report,
radiative forcing is further defined as the change relative to the year
1750 and, unless otherwise noted, refers to a global and annual average
value. Radiative forcing is not to be confused with cloud radiative forcing,
which describes an unrelated measure of the impact of clouds on the
radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere.

Sea level can change, both globally and locally due to (1) changes in
the shape of the ocean basins, (2) a change in ocean volume as a result
of a change in the mass of water in the ocean, and (3) changes in ocean
volume as a result of changes in ocean water density. Global mean sea
level change resulting from change in the mass of the ocean is called
barystatic. The amount of barystatic sea level change due to the addition
or removal of a mass of water is called its sea level equivalent (SLE).
Sea level changes, both globally and locally, resulting from changes in
water density are called steric. Density changes induced by temperature
changes only are called thermosteric, while density changes induced by
salinity changes are called halosteric. Barystatic and steric sea level
changes do not include the effect of changes in the shape of ocean
basins induced by the change in the ocean mass and its distribution.

with social policy and can be described as all public and private initiatives
that provide access to services, such as health, education, or housing, or
income and consumption transfers to people. Social protection policies
protect the poor and vulnerable against livelihood risks and enhance
the social status and rights of the marginalized, as well as prevent
vulnerable people from falling into poverty.
