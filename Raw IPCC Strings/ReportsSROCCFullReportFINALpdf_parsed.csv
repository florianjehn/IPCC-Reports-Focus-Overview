"This /PCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing
Climate (SROCC), is the third Special Report to be produced in
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Sixth
Assessment Report (AR6) cycle. SROCC is unique because — for the
first time — the IPCC has produced an in-depth report examining
the farthest corners of the Earth — from the highest mountains
and remote polar regions to the deepest oceans. The report finds
that even and especially in these places, human-caused climate
change is evident. These changes show that the world’s ocean
and cryosphere have been ‘taking the heat’ for climate change for
decades. The consequences for nature and humanity are sweeping
and severe. This report highlights the urgency of timely, ambitious,
coordinated, and enduring action.
"	Text
"SROCC was jointly prepared by Working Groups | and II, and provides
the latest state of knowledge on the ocean and cryosphere in
a changing climate. It focuses on changes to mountain cryosphere,
polar regions and ecosystems, sea level rise and coastal extremes,
ocean and marine life, as well as providing key information to enable
action at all scales and to manage risks and build resilience through
adaptation for the benefit of ecosystems and human societies. The
report highlights the observed and projected changes in the ocean
and cryosphere, the associated impacts and risks for human societies
and ecosystems, as well as assessing a range of response options
and adaption measures. SROCC clearly presents the level of risks
and the limits of adaptation for high emission scenarios and thereby
the benefits of ambitious and effective adaptation for sustainable
development. It highlights the importance of irreversible and
committed changes on timescales of decades to centuries. It stresses
the urgency of near-term action to reduce risks also by reducing
emissions of greenhouse gases, strengthening findings from the SR15
and SRCCL reports.

"The IPCC SROCC responds to proposals for Special Reports from
governments and observer organisations provided at the start of the
IPCC AR6 cycle. It assesses the observed and projected changes to
the ocean and cryosphere and their associated impacts and risks,
with a focus on resilience, risk management response options, and
adaptation measures, considering both their potential and limitations.
SROCC brings together knowledge on physical and biogeochemical
changes, the interplay with ecosystem changes, and the implications
for human communities. The report was produced with careful
attention to other assessments, with the aim of achieving coherence
and complementarity, as well as providing an updated assessment

meeting for SROCC was held in Monaco in December 2016, and the
final outline was agreed by the Panel at its 45th Session in March 2017
in Guadalajara, Mexico. Governments and IPCC observer organisations
nominated more than 500 experts for the chapter team. The team of
14 Coordinating Lead Authors, 75 Lead Authors, and 15 Review Editors
were selected by Working Groups | and II Bureaux. In addition, 222
Contributing Authors were invited by the chapter teams to provide
scientific and technical information in the form of text, graphs or data.
The report drafts prepared by the authors were subject to two rounds
of formal review and revision followed by a final round of government
comments on the Summary for Policymakers. The enthusiastic
participation of the scientific community and governments to the
review process resulted in over 31,000 written review comments,

"This Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere! in a Changing Climate (SROCC) was prepared following an IPCC Panel
decision in 2016 to prepare three Special Reports during the Sixth Assessment Cycle. By assessing new scientific literature?,
the SROCC‘ responds to government and observer organization proposals. The SROCC follows the other two Special Reports
on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5) and on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL)° and the Intergovernmental Science Policy

"This Summary for Policymakers (SPM) compiles key findings of the report and is structured in three parts: SPM.A: Observed
Changes and Impacts, SPM.B: Projected Changes and Risks, and SPM.C: Implementing Responses to Ocean and Cryosphere
Change. To assist navigation of the SPM, icons indicate where content can be found. Confidence in key findings is reported

using IPCC calibrated language® and the underlying scientific basis for each key finding is indicated by references to sections
of the underlying report.

"The cryosphere is defined in this report (Annex |: Glossary) as the components of the Earth System at and below the land and ocean surface that are
frozen, including snow cover, glaciers, ice sheets, ice shelves, icebergs, sea ice, lake ice, river ice, permafrost, and seasonally frozen ground.

The decision to prepare a Special Report on Climate Change and Oceans and the Cryosphere was made at the Forty-Third Session of the IPCC in
Nairobi, Kenya, 11-13 April 2016.

Cut-off dates: 15 October 2018 for manuscript submission, 15 May 2019 for acceptance for publication.

The SROCC is produced under the scientific leadership of Working Group | and Working Group II. In line with the approved outline, mitigation options
(Working Group III) are not assessed with the exception of the mitigation potential of blue carbon (coastal ecosystems).

The full titles of these two Special Reports are: “Global Warming of 1.5°C. An IPCC special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above
pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of

climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty”; “Climate Change and Land: an IPCC special report on climate change,
desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems”.

Each finding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement. A level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers: very low, low,
medium, high and very high, and typeset in italics, e.g., medium confidence. The following terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of
an outcome or a result: virtually certain 99-100% probability, very likely 90-100%, likely 66—100%, about as likely as not 33-66%, unlikely 0-33%,
very unlikely 0-10%, exceptionally unlikely 0-1%. Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics, e.g., very likely. This is consistent with ARS and the other
AR6 Special Reports. Additional terms (extremely likely 95-100%, more likely than not >50-100%, more unlikely than likely O-<50%, extremely
unlikely 0-5%) are used when appropriate. This Report also uses the term ‘likely range’ or ‘very likely range’ to indicate that the assessed likelihood
of an outcome lies within the 17-83% or 5-95% probability range. {1.9.2, Figure 1.4}

"All people on Earth depend directly or indirectly on the ocean and cryosphere. The global ocean covers 71% of the
Earth surface and contains about 97% of the Earth's water. The cryosphere refers to frozen components of the Earth
system!. Around 10% of Earth's land area is covered by glaciers or ice sheets. The ocean and cryosphere support
unique habitats, and are interconnected with other components of the climate system through global exchange of
water, energy and carbon. The projected responses of the ocean and cryosphere to past and current human-induced
greenhouse gas emissions and ongoing global warming include climate feedbacks, changes over decades to millennia
that cannot be avoided, thresholds of abrupt change, and irreversibility. {Box 1.1, 1.2}

"Human communities in close connection with coastal environments, small islands (including Small Island Developing
States, SIDS), polar areas and high mountains’ are particularly exposed to ocean and cryosphere change, such as sea
level rise, extreme sea level and shrinking cryosphere. Other communities further from the coast are also exposed to
changes in the ocean, such as through extreme weather events. Today, around 4 million people live permanently in
the Arctic region, of whom 10% are Indigenous. The low-lying coastal zone’ is currently home to around 680 million
people (nearly 10% of the 2010 global population), projected to reach more than one billion by 2050. SIDS are home
to 65 million people. Around 670 million people (nearly 10% of the 2010 global population), including Indigenous
peoples, live in high mountain regions in all continents except Antarctica. In high mountain regions, population is
projected to reach between 740 and 840 million by 2050 (about 8.4-8.7% of the projected global population).

a low greenhouse gas emissions, high mitigation future, that in CMIP5 simulations gives a two in three chance of
limiting global warming to below 2°C by 2100"". By contrast, RCP8.5 is a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario
in the absence of policies to combat climate change, leading to continued and sustained growth in atmospheric
greenhouse gas concentrations. Compared to the total set of RCPs, RCP8.5 corresponds to the pathway with the

ZJ is Zettajoule and is equal to 102! Joules. Warming the entire ocean by 1°C requires about 5500 ZJ; 144 ZJ would warm the top 100 m by about 1°C.

A marine heatwave is a period of extreme warm near-sea surface temperature that persists for days to months and can extend up to thousands of
kilometres (Annex |: Glossary).

In this report density stratification is defined as the density contrast between shallower and deeper layers. Increased stratification reduces the vertical

It is virtually certain that the global ocean has warmed unabated since 1970 and has taken u
more than 90% of the excess heat in the climate system (high confidence). Since 1993, the rat
of ocean warming has more than doubled (likely). Marine heatwaves have very likely double

Deis Observations, both in situ (2004-2017) and based on sea surface temperature reconstructions,
indicate that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)*' has weakened relative to 1850-1900
(medium confidence). There is insufficient data to quantify the magnitude of the weakening, or to properly attribute
it to anthropogenic forcing due to the limited length of the observational record. Although attribution is currently not
possible, CMIP5 model simulations of the period 1850-2015, on average, exhibit a weakening AMOC when driven by
anthropogenic forcing. {6.7}

Global mean sea level (GMSL) is rising, with acceleration in recent decades due to increasing
rates of ice loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets (very high confidence), as well as
continued glacier mass loss and ocean thermal expansion. Increases in tropical cyclone winds
and rainfall, and increases in extreme waves, combined with relative sea level rise, exacerbate
extreme sea level events and coastal hazards (high confidence). {3.3, 4.2, 6.2, 6.3, 6.8, Figures
SPM.1, SPM.2, SPM.4, SPM.5}

A\ x Total GMSL rise for 1902-2015 is 0.16 m (likely range 0.12-0.21 m). The rate of GMSL rise for
2006-2015 of 3.6 mm yr“ (3.1-4.1 mm yr"", very likely range), is unprecedented over the last century (high confidence),
and about 2.5 times the rate for 1901-1990 of 1.4 mm yr (0.8- 2.0 mm yr"", very likely range). The sum of ice
sheet and glacier contributions over the period 2006-2015 is the dominant source of sea level rise (1.8 mm yr"", very
likely range 1.7-1.9 mm yr), exceeding the effect of thermal expansion of ocean water (1.4 mm yr"", very likely
range 1.1-1.7 mm yr)”? (very high confidence). The dominant cause of global mean sea level rise since 1970 is
anthropogenic forcing (high confidence). {4.2.1, 4.2.2, Figure SPM.1}

Sea level rise has accelerated (extremely likely) due to the combined increased ice loss from
the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets (very high confidence). Mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet over the period
2007-2016 tripled relative to 1997-2006. For Greenland, mass loss doubled over the same period (likely, medium
confidence). {3.3.1, Figures SPM.1, SPM.2, SPM A.1.1}

Acceleration of ice flow and retreat in Antarctica, which has the potential to lead to sea
level rise of several metres within a few centuries, is observed in the Amundsen Sea Embayment of West Antarctica
and in Wilkes Land, East Antarctica (very high confidence). These changes may be the onset of an irreversible? ice
sheet instability. Uncertainty related to the onset of ice sheet instability arises from limited observations, inadequate
model representation of ice sheet processes, and limited understanding of the complex interactions between the
atmosphere, ocean and the ice sheet. {3.3.1, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3, 4.2.3}

Sea level rise is not globally uniform and varies regionally. Regional differences, within +30%
of the global mean sea level rise, result from land ice loss and variations in ocean warming and circulation. Differences
from the global mean can be greater in areas of rapid vertical land movement including from local human activities
(e.g. extraction of groundwater). (high confidence) {4.2.2, 5.2.2, 6.2.2, 6.3.1, 6.8.2, Figure SPM.2}

Cryospheric and associated hydrological changes have impacted terrestrial and freshwater
species and ecosystems in high mountain and polar regions through the appearance of land
previously covered by ice, changes in snow cover, and thawing permafrost. These changes have
contributed to changing the seasonal activities, abundance and distribution of ecologically,
culturally, and economically important plant and animal species, ecological disturbances, and
ecosystem functioning. (high confidence) {2.3.2, 2.3.3, 3.4.1, 3.4.3, Box 3.4, Figure SPM.2}

iN Over the last century some species of plants and animals have increased in abundance, shifted
their range, and established in new areas as glaciers receded and the snow-free season lengthened (high confidence).
Together with warming, these changes have increased locally the number of species in high mountains, as
lower-elevation species migrate upslope (very high confidence). Some cold-adapted or snow-dependent species
have declined in abundance, increasing their risk of extinction, notably on mountain summits (high confidence). In
polar and mountain regions, many species have altered seasonal activities especially in late winter and spring (high
confidence). {2.3.3, Box 3.4}

iN Increased wildfire and abrupt permafrost thaw, as well as changes in Arctic and mountain
hydrology have altered frequency and intensity of ecosystem disturbances (high confidence). This has included positive
and negative impacts on vegetation and wildlife such as reindeer and salmon (high confidence). {2.3.3, 3.4.1, 3.4.3}

Ia Across tundra, satellite observations show an overall greening, often indicative of increased
plant productivity (high confidence). Some browning areas in tundra and boreal forest are indicative that productivity
has decreased (high confidence). These changes have negatively affected provisioning, regulating and cultural
ecosystem services, with also some transient positive impacts for provisioning services, in both high mountains
(medium confidence) and polar regions (high confidence). {2.3.1, 2.3.3, 3.4.1, 3.4.3, Annex |: Glossary}

Since about 1950 many marine species across various groups have undergone shifts in
geographical range and seasonal activities in response to ocean warming, sea ice change and
biogeochemical changes, such as oxygen loss, to their habitats (high confidence). This has
resulted in shifts in species composition, abundance and biomass production of ecosystems,
from the equator to the poles. Altered interactions between species have caused cascading
impacts on ecosystem structure and functioning (medium confidence). In some marine
ecosystems species are impacted by both the effects of fishing and climate changes (medium
confidence). {3.2.3, 3.2.4, Box 3.4, 5.2.3, 5.3, 5.4.1, Figure SPM.2}

oS Rates of poleward shifts in distributions across different marine species since the 1950s
are 52 + 33 km per decade and 29 + 16 km per decade (very likely ranges) for organisms in the epipelagic
(upper 200 m from sea surface) and seafloor ecosystems, respectively. The rate and direction of observed shifts in
distributions are shaped by local temperature, oxygen, and ocean currents across depth, latitudinal and longitudinal
gradients (high confidence). Warming-induced species range expansions have led to altered ecosystem structure
and functioning such as in the North Atlantic, Northeast Pacific and Arctic (medium confidence). {5.2.3, 5.3.2, 5.3.6,
Box 3.4, Figure SPM.2}

oS In recent decades, Arctic net primary production has increased in ice-free waters
(high confidence) and spring phytoplankton blooms are occurring earlier in the year in response to sea ice change
and nutrient availability with spatially variable positive and negative consequences for marine ecosystems (medium
confidence). In the Antarctic, such changes are spatially heterogeneous and have been associated with rapid local
environmental change, including retreating glaciers and sea ice change (medium confidence). Changes in the
seasonal activities, production and distribution of some Arctic zooplankton and a southward shift in the distribution
of the Antarctic krill population in the South Atlantic are associated with climate-linked environmental changes
(medium confidence). In polar regions, ice associated marine mammals and seabirds have experienced habitat
contraction linked to sea ice changes (high confidence) and impacts on foraging success due to climate impacts on
prey distributions (medium confidence). Cascading effects of multiple climate-related drivers on polar zooplankton
have affected food web structure and function, biodiversity as well as fisheries (high confidence). {3.2.3, 3.2.4,

& Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUS) are amongst the most productive ocean
ecosystems. Increasing ocean acidification and oxygen loss are negatively impacting two of the four major upwelling
systems: the California Current and Humboldt Current (high confidence). Ocean acidification and decrease in oxygen
level in the California Current upwelling system have altered ecosystem structure, with direct negative impacts on
biomass production and species composition (medium confidence). {Box 5.3, Figure SPM.2}

Pats Ocean warming in the 20th century and beyond has contributed to an overall decrease in
maximum catch potential (medium confidence), compounding the impacts from overfishing for some fish stocks
(high confidence). In many regions, declines in the abundance of fish and shellfish stocks due to direct and indirect
effects of global warming and biogeochemical changes have already contributed to reduced fisheries catches
(high confidence). In some areas, changing ocean conditions have contributed to the expansion of suitable habitat and/
or increases in the abundance of some species (high confidence). These changes have been accompanied by changes
in species composition of fisheries catches since the 1970s in many ecosystems (medium confidence). {3.2.3, 5.4.1,

Coastal ecosystems are affected by ocean warming, including intensified marine heatwaves,
acidification, loss of oxygen, salinity intrusion and sea level rise, in combination with adverse
effects from human activities on ocean and land (high confidence). Impacts are already
observed on habitat area and biodiversity, as well as ecosystem functioning and services
(high confidence). {4.3.2, 4.3.3, 5.3, 5.4.1, 6.4.2, Figure SPM.2}

De ;
yay Vegetated coastal ecosystems protect the coastline from storms and erosion and help

buffer the impacts of sea level rise. Nearly 50% of coastal wetlands have been lost over the last 100 years, as
a result of the combined effects of localised human pressures, sea level rise, warming and extreme climate events
(high confidence). Vegetated coastal ecosystems are important carbon stores; their loss is responsible for the
current release of 0.04-1.46 GtC yr (medium confidence). In response to warming, distribution ranges of seagrass
meadows and kelp forests are expanding at high latitudes and contracting at low latitudes since the late 1970s
(high confidence), and in some areas episodic losses occur following heatwaves (medium confidence). Large-scale
mangrove mortality that is related to warming since the 1960s has been partially offset by their encroachment into
subtropical saltmarshes as a result of increase in temperature, causing the loss of open areas with herbaceous plants
that provide food and habitat for dependent fauna (high confidence). {4.3.3, 5.3.2, 5.3.6, 5.4.1, 5.5.1, Figure SPM.2}

ya» Increased sea water intrusion in estuaries due to sea level rise has driven upstream

redistribution of marine species (medium confidence) and caused a reduction of suitable habitats for estuarine
communities (medium confidence). Increased nutrient and organic matter loads in estuaries since the 1970s from
intensive human development and riverine loads have exacerbated the stimulating effects of ocean warming on
bacterial respiration, leading to expansion of low oxygen areas (high confidence). {5.3.1}

physical changes and impacts at least partly to a change in the cryosphere is shown. No assessment means: not applicable, not assessed at regional
scale, or the evidence is insufficient for assessment. The physical changes in the ocean are defined as: Temperature change in 0-700 m layer of the
ocean except for Southern Ocean (0-2000 m) and Arctic Ocean (upper mixed layer and major inflowing branches); Oxygen in the 0-1200 m layer

Since the mid-20th century, the shrinking cryosphere in the Arctic and high mountain area:
has led to predominantly negative impacts on food security, water resources, water quality
livelihoods, health and well-being, infrastructure, transportation, tourism and recreation, a:

Global-scale glacier mass loss, permafrost thaw, and decline in snow cover and Arctic sea
extent are projected to continue in the near-term (2031-2050) due to surface air temperat
increases (high confidence), with unavoidable consequences for river runoff and local haza

increasing rate throughout the 21st century and beyond (high confidence). The rates <
magnitudes of these cryospheric changes are projected to increase further in the second |

Andes, Mexico, eastern Africa and Indonesia), are projected to lose more than 80% of their current ice mass by 2
under RCP8.5 (medium confidence), and many glaciers are projected to disappear regardless of future emiss

likely range) under RCP2.6, and 0.15 m (0.08-0.27 m, likely range) under RCP8.5. In 2100, the Antarctic Ice S|
is projected to contribute 0.04 m (0.01-0.11 m, likely range) under RCP2.6, and 0.12 m (0.03-0.28 m, likely rai
under RCP8.5. The Greenland Ice Sheet is currently contributing more to sea level rise than the Antarctic Ice SI
(high confidence), but Antarctica could become a larger contributor by the end of the 21st century as a conseque
of rapid retreat (low confidence). Beyond 2100, increasing divergence between Greenland and Antarctica’s rela
contributions to GMSL rise under RCP8.5 has important consequences for the pace of relative sea level rise in
Northern Hemisphere. {3.3.1, 4.2.3, 4.2.5, 4.3.3, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3, Figure SPM.1}

LN Widespread permafrost thaw is projected for this century (very high confidence) and beyond.
By 2100, projected near-surface (within 3-4 m) permafrost area shows a decrease of 24 + 16% (likely range) for
RCP2.6 and 69 + 20% (likely range) for RCP8.5. The RCP8.5 scenario leads to the cumulative release of tens to
hundreds of billions of tons (GtC) of permafrost carbon as C076 and methane to the atmosphere by 2100 with
the potential to exacerbate climate change (medium confidence). Lower emissions scenarios dampen the response
of carbon emissions from the permafrost region (high confidence). Methane contributes a small fraction of the
total additional carbon release but is significant because of its higher warming potential. Increased plant growth is
projected to replenish soil carbon in part, but will not match carbon releases over the long term (medium confidence).
{2.2.4, 3.4.2, 3.4.3, Figure SPM.1, Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1}

LN In many high mountain areas, glacier retreat and permafrost thaw are projected to further
decrease the stability of slopes, and the number and area of glacier lakes will continue to increase (high confidence).
Floods due to glacier lake outburst or rain-on-snow, landslides and snow avalanches, are projected to occur also in
new locations or different seasons (high confidence). {2.3.2}

LN River runoff in snow-dominated or glacier-fed high mountain basins is projected to change
regardless of emissions scenario (very high confidence), with increases in average winter runoff (high confidence)
and earlier spring peaks (very high confidence). In all emissions scenarios, average annual and summer runoff from
glaciers are projected to peak at or before the end of the 21st century (high confidence), e.g., around mid-century in
High Mountain Asia, followed by a decline in glacier runoff. In regions with little glacier cover (e.g., tropical Andes,
European Alps) most glaciers have already passed this peak (high confidence). Projected declines in glacier runoff by
2100 (RCP8.5) can reduce basin runoff by 10% or more in at least one month of the melt season in several large river
basins, especially in High Mountain Asia during the dry season (low confidence). {2.3.1}

depending on the magnitude of global warming: for stabilised global warming of 1.5°C the annual probability of
a sea ice-free September by the end of century is approximately 1%, which rises to 10-35% for stabilised global
warming of 2°C (high confidence). There is low confidence in projections for Antarctic sea ice. {3.2.2, Figure SPM.1}

locations depending on exposure (high confidence). Sea level rise is projected to continu
beyond 2100 in all RCP scenarios. For a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5), projections of globa
sea level rise by 2100 are greater than in AR5 due to a larger contribution from the Antarcti
Ice Sheet (medium confidence). In coming centuries under RCP8.5, seatevel rise is projected t

while for RCP2.6 sea level rise is projected to be limited to around 1 min 2300 (low confidence)
Extreme sea levels and coastal hazards will be exacerbated by projected increases in tropica

The rate of global mean sea level rise is projected to reach 15 mm yr! (10-20 mm yr, likel

reduced emissions for limiting sea level rise. Processes controlling the timing of future ice-shelf loss and the extent o
ice sheet instabilities could increase Antarctica’s contribution to sea level rise to values substantially higher than th

Peis Projected ocean warming and changes in net primary production alter biomass, production
and community structure of marine ecosystems. The global-scale biomass of marine animals across the foodweb is
projected to decrease by 15.0 + 5.9% (very likely range) and the maximum catch potential of fisheries by 20.5-24.1%
by the end of the 21st century relative to 1986-2005 under RCP8.5 (medium confidence). These changes are projected
to be very likely three to four times larger under RCP8.5 than RCP2.6. {3.2.3, 3.3.3, 5.2.2, 5.2.3, 5.4.1, Figure SPM.3}

& Under enhanced stratification reduced nutrient supply is projected to cause tropical ocean
net primary production to decline by 7-16% (very likely range) for RCP8.5 by 2081-2100 (medium confidence). In
tropical regions, marine animal biomass and production are projected to decrease more than the global average
under all emissions scenarios in the 21st century (high confidence). Warming and sea ice changes are projected to
increase marine net primary production in the Arctic (medium confidence) and around Antarctica (low confidence),
modified by changing nutrient supply due to shifts in upwelling and stratification. Globally, the sinking flux of organic
matter from the upper ocean is projected to decrease, linked largely due to changes in net primary production
(high confidence). As a result, 95% or more of the deep sea (3000-6000 m depth) seafloor area and cold-water
coral ecosystems are projected to experience declines in benthic biomass under RCP8.5 (medium confidence).

& Warming, ocean acidification, reduced seasonal sea ice extent and continued loss of
multi-year sea ice are projected to impact polar marine ecosystems through direct and indirect effects on habitats,
populations and their viability (medium confidence). The geographical range of Arctic marine species, including
marine mammals, birds and fish is projected to contract, while the range of some sub-Arctic fish communities is
projected to expand, further increasing pressure on high-Arctic species (medium confidence). In the Southern Ocean,
the habitat of Antarctic krill, a key prey species for penguins, seals and whales, is projected to contract southwards
under both RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 (medium confidence). {3.2.2, 3.2.3, 5.2.3}

relation to changes in Global Mean Surface Temperature (GMST) relative to pre-industrial level. Since assessments of risks and impacts are based
on global mean Sea Surface Temperature (SST), the corresponding SST levels are shown. The assessment of risk transitions is described in Chapter
5 Sections 5.2, 5.3, 5.2.5 and 5.3.7 and Supplementary Materials SM5.3, Table SM5.6, Table SM5.8 and other parts of the underlying report. The
figure indicates assessed risks at approximate warming levels and increasing climate-related hazards in the ocean: ocean warming, acidification,
deoxygenation, increased density stratification, changes in carbon fluxes, sea level rise, and increased frequency and/or intensity of extreme events.
The assessment considers the natural adaptive capacity of the ecosystems, their exposure and vulnerability. Impact and risk levels do not consider
tisk reduction strategies such as human interventions, or future changes in non-climatic drivers. Risks for ecosystems were assessed by considering
biological, biogeochemical, geomorphological and physical aspects. Higher risks associated with compound effects of climate hazards include
habitat and biodiversity loss, changes in species composition and distribution ranges, and impacts/risks on ecosystem structure and functioning,
including changes in animal/plant biomass and density, productivity, carbon fluxes, and sediment transport. As part of the assessment, literature was
compiled and data extracted into a summary table. A multi-round expert elicitation process was undertaken with independent evaluation of threshold
judgement, and a final consensus discussion. Further information on methods and underlying literature can be found in Chapter 5, Sections 5.2
and 5.3 and Supplementary Material. (3.2.3, 3.2.4, 5.2, 5.3, 5.2.5, 5.3.7, SM5.6, SM5.8, Figure 5.16, Cross Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1 Table CCB1}

Risks of severe impacts on biodiversity, structure and function of coastal ecosystems are
projected to be higher for elevated temperatures under high compared to low emissions
scenarios in the 21st century and beyond. Projected ecosystem responses include losses
of species habitat and diversity, and degradation of ecosystem functions. The capacity of
organisms and ecosystems to adjust and adapt is higher at lower emissions scenarios (high
confidence). For sensitive ecosystems such as seagrass meadows and kelp forests, high risks
are projected if global warming exceeds 2°C above pre-industrial temperature, combined with
other climate-related hazards (high confidence). Warm-water corals are at high risk already
and are projected to transition to very high risk even if global warming is limited to 1.5°C
(very high confidence). {4.3.3, 5.3, 5.5, Figure SPM.3}

high risk under RCP2.6 to high to very high risk under RCP8.5 by 2100. Intertidal rocky shore ecosystems are projected
to be at very high risk by 2100 under RCP8.5 (medium confidence) due to exposure to warming, especially during
marine heatwaves, as well as to acidification, sea level rise, loss of calcifying species and biodiversity (high confidence).
Ocean acidification challenges these ecosystems and further limits their habitat suitability (medium confidence) by
inhibiting recovery through reduced calcification and enhanced bioerosion. The decline of kelp forests is projected to

~ In the absence of more ambitious adaptation efforts compared to today, and under current

trends of increasing exposure and vulnerability of coastal communities, risks, such as erosion and land loss, flooding,
salinization, and cascading impacts due to mean sea level rise and extreme events are projected to significantly
increase throughout this century under all greenhouse gas emissions scenarios (very high confidence). Under the
same assumptions, annual coastal flood damages are projected to increase by 2-3 orders of magnitude by 2100
compared to today (high confidence). {4.3.3, 4.3.4, Box 6.1, 6.8, SM.4.3, Figures SPM.4, SPM.5}

yay High to very high risks are approached for vulnerable communities in coral reef environments,
urban atoll islands and low-lying Arctic locations from sea level rise well before the end of this century in case of high
emissions scenarios. This entails adaptation limits being reached, which are the points at which an actor's objectives
(or system needs) cannot be secured from intolerable risks through adaptive actions (high confidence). Reaching
adaptation limits (e.g., biophysical, geographical, financial, technical, social, political, and institutional) depends on the
emissions scenario and context-specific risk tolerance, and is projected to expand to more areas beyond 2100, due to the
long-term commitment of sea level rise (medium confidence). Some island nations are likely to become uninhabitable
due to climate-related ocean and cryosphere change (medium confidence), but habitability thresholds remain extremely
difficult to assess. {4.3.4, 4.4.2, 4.4.3, 5.5.2, Cross-Chapter Box 9, SM.4.3, SPM C.1, Glossary, Figure SPM.5}

Globally, a slower rate of climate-related ocean and cryosphere change provides greater
adaptation opportunities (high confidence). While there is high confidence that ambitious adaptation, including
governance for transformative change, has the potential to reduce risks in many locations, such benefits can vary
between locations. At global scale, coastal protection can reduce flood risk by 2-3 orders of magnitude during
the 21st century, but depends on investments on the order of tens to several hundreds of billions of US$ per year
(high confidence). While such investments are generally cost efficient for densely populated urban areas, rural and
poorer areas may be challenged to afford such investments with relative annual costs for some small island states
amounting to several percent of GDP (high confidence). Even with major adaptation efforts, residual risks and
associated losses are projected to occur (medium confidence), but context-specific limits to adaptation and residual
risks remain difficult to assess. {4.1.3, 4.2.2.4, 4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.3.4, 4.4.3, 6.9.1, 6.9.2, Cross-Chapter Boxes 1-2 in

Ia Integrated water management approaches across multiple scales can be effective at
addressing impacts and leveraging opportunities from cryosphere changes in high mountain areas. These approaches
also support water resource management through the development and optimization of multi-purpose storage
and release of water from reservoirs (medium confidence), with consideration of potentially negative impacts to
ecosystems and communities. Diversification of tourism activities throughout the year supports adaptation in high
mountain economies (medium confidence). {2.3.1, 2.3.5}

Coastal communities face challenging choices in crafting context-specific and integrated
responses to sea level rise that balance costs, benefits and trade-offs of available options
and that can be adjusted over time (high confidence). All types of options, including
protection, accommodation, ecosystem-based adaptation, coastal advance and retreat,
wherever possible, can play important roles in such integrated responses (high confidence).
{4.4.2, 4.4.3, 4.4.4, 6.9.1, Cross-Chapter Box 9, Figure SPM.5}

The higher the sea levels rise, the more challenging is coastal protection, mainly due to

economic, financial and social barriers rather than due to technical limits (high confidence). In the coming decades,
reducing local drivers of exposure and vulnerability such as coastal urbanization and human-induced subsidence
constitute effective responses (high confidence). Where space is limited, and the value of exposed assets is high
(e.g., in cities), hard protection (e.g., dikes) is likely to be a cost-efficient response option during the 21st century
taking into account the specifics of the context (high confidence), but resource-limited areas may not be able to
afford such investments. Where space is available, ecosystem-based adaptation can reduce coastal risk and provide
multiple other benefits such as carbon storage, improved water quality, biodiversity conservation and livelihood
support (medium confidence). {4.3.2, 4.4.2, Box 4.1, Cross-Chapter Box 9, Figure SPM.5}

~ Some coastal accommodation measures, such as early warning systems and flood-proofing of

buildings, are often both low cost and highly cost-efficient under current sea levels (high confidence). Under projected
sea level rise and increase in coastal hazards some of these measures become less effective unless combined with
other measures (high confidence). All types of options, including protection, accommodation, ecosystem-based
adaptation, coastal advance and planned relocation, if alternative localities are available, can play important roles in
such integrated responses (high confidence). Where the community affected is small, or in the aftermath of a disaster,
reducing risk by coastal planned relocations is worth considering if safe alternative localities are available. Such
planned relocation can be socially, culturally, financially and politically constrained (very high confidence). {4.4.2,
Box 4.1, Cross-Chapter Box 9, SPM B.3}

~ Responses to sea level rise and associated risk reduction present society with profound

governance challenges, resulting from the uncertainty about the magnitude and rate of future sea level rise, vexing
trade-offs between societal goals (e.g., safety, conservation, economic development, intra- and inter-generational
equity), limited resources, and conflicting interests and values among diverse stakeholders (high confidence).
These challenges can be eased using locally appropriate combinations of decision analysis, land-use planning,
public participation, diverse knowledge systems and conflict resolution approaches that are adjusted over time as
circumstances change (high confidence). {Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1, 4.4.3, 4.4.4, 6.9}

~ Despite the large uncertainties about the magnitude and rate of post 2050 sea level rise, many

coastal decisions with time horizons of decades to over a century are being made now (e.g., critical infrastructure,
coastal protection works, city planning) and can be improved by taking relative sea level rise into account, favouring
flexible responses (i.e, those that can be adapted over time) supported by monitoring systems for early warning
signals, periodically adjusting decisions (i.e., adaptive decision making), using robust decision-making approaches,
expert judgement, scenario-building, and multiple knowledge systems (high confidence). The sea level rise range
that needs to be considered for planning and implementing coastal responses depends on the risk tolerance of

"Figure SPM.5 | Sea level rise risks and responses. The term response is used here instead of adaptation because some responses, such as retreat,
may or may not be considered to be adaptation. (a) shows the combined risk of coastal flooding, erosion and salinization for illustrative geographies
in 2100, due to changing mean and extreme sea levels under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 and under two response scenarios. Risks under RCPs 4.5 and 6.0
were not assessed due to a lack of literature for the assessed geographies. The assessment does not account for changes in extreme sea level beyond
those directly induced by mean sea level rise; risk levels could increase if other changes in extreme sea levels were considered (e.g., due to changes
in cyclone intensity). Panel a) considers a socioeconomic scenario with relatively stable coastal population density over the century. {SM4.3.2} Risks to
illustrative geographies have been assessed based on relative sea level changes projected for a set of specific examples: New York City, Shanghai and
Rotterdam for resource-rich coastal cities covering a wide range of response experiences; South Tarawa, Fongafale and Male’ for urban atoll islands;
Mekong and Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna for large tropical agricultural deltas; and Bykovskiy, Shishmaref, Kivalina, Tuktoyaktuk and Shingle Point
for Arctic communities located in regions remote from rapid glacio-isostatic adjustment. {4.2, 4.3.4, SM4.2} The assessment distinguishes between
two contrasting response scenarios. “No-to-moderate response” describes efforts as of today (i.e., no further significant action or new types of
actions). “Maximum potential response” represents a combination of responses implemented to their full extent and thus significant additional efforts
compared to today, assuming minimal financial, social and political barriers. The assessment has been conducted for each sea level rise and response
scenario, as indicated by the burning embers in the figure; in-between risk levels are interpolated. {4.3.3} The assessment criteria include exposure
and vulnerability (density of assets, level of degradation of terrestrial and marine buffer ecosystems), coastal hazards (flooding, shoreline erosion,
salinization), in-situ responses (hard engineered coastal defenses, ecosystem restoration or creation of new natural buffers areas, and subsidence
management) and planned relocation. Planned relocation refers to managed retreat or resettlement as described in Chapter 4, i.e., proactive and
local-scale measures to reduce risk by relocating people, assets and infrastructure. Forced displacement is not considered in this assessment. Panel (a)
also highlights the relative contributions of in-situ responses and planned relocation to the total risk reduction. (b) schematically illustrates the risk
reduction (vertical arrows) and risk delay (horizontal arrows) through mitigation and/or responses to sea level rise. (c) summarizes and assesses
responses to sea level rise in terms of their effectiveness, costs, co-benefits, drawbacks, economic efficiency and associated governance challenges.
{4.4.2} (d) presents generic steps of an adaptive decision-making approach, as well as key enabling conditions for responses to sea level rise.

responses to climate-related changes in the ocean and cryosphere include intensifying
cooperation and coordination among governing authorities across spatial scales and planning
horizons. Education and climate literacy, monitoring and forecasting, use of all available
knowledge sources, sharing of data, information and knowledge, finance, addressing social
vulnerability and equity, and institutional support are also essential. Such investments

LN x & In light of observed and projected changes in the ocean and cryosphere, many nations will
face challenges to adapt, even with ambitious mitigation (very high confidence). In a high emissions scenario, many
ocean- and cryosphere-dependent communities are projected to face adaptation limits (e.g. biophysical, geographical,
financial, technical, social, political and institutional) during the second half of the 21st century. Low emission
pathways, for comparison, limit the risks from ocean and cryosphere changes in this century and beyond and enable
more effective responses (high confidence), whilst also creating co-benefits. Profound economic and institutional
transformative change will enable Climate Resilient Development Pathways in the ocean and cryosphere context

ambitious mitigation and effective adaptation for sustainable development and, conversely, the escalating costs and

Each finding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement. The summary terms for evidence are: limited, medium or robust. For agreement, they are
low, medium or high. In many cases, a synthesis of evidence and agreement supports an assignment of confidence. A level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers:
very low, low, medium, high and very high, and typeset in italics, e.g., medium confidence. The following terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an
outcome or a result: virtually certain 99-100% probability, very likely 90-100%, likely 66-100%, about as likely as not 33-66%, unlikely 0-33%, very unlikely 0-10%,
exceptionally unlikely 0—1%. Additional terms (extremely likely 95-100%, more likely than not >50-100%, more unlikely than likely O-<50%, extremely unlikely 0-5%)
may also be used when appropriate. Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics, e.g., very likely. This Report also uses the term ‘likely range’ or ‘very likely range’ to indicate
that the assessed likelihood of an outcome lies within the 17-83% or 5~95% probability range. For more details see Chapter 1, Section 1.9.2 and Figure 1.4.

are shown in different formats in (a) and (b). For each region, physical changes, impacts on key ecosystems, and impacts on human systems and ecosystem function and services are shown.
For physical changes, yellow/green refers to an increase/decrease, respectively, in amount or frequency of the measured variable. For impacts on ecosystems, human systems and ecosystems
services blue or red depicts whether an observed impact is positive (beneficial) or negative (adverse), respectively, to the given system or service. Cells assigned ‘increase and decrease’
indicate that within that region, both increase and decrease of physical changes are found, but are not necessarily equal; the same holds for cells showing ‘positive and negative’ attributable
impacts. For ocean regions, the confidence level refers to the confidence in attributing observed changes to changes in greenhouse gas forcing for physical changes and to climate change for
ecosystem, human systems, and ecosystem services. For high mountain and polar land regions, the level of confidence in attributing physical changes and impacts at least partly to a change
in the cryosphere is shown. No assessment means: not applicable, not assessed at regional scale, or the evidence is insufficient for assessment. The physical changes in the ocean are defined
as: Temperature change in 0-700 m layer of the ocean except for Southern Ocean (0-2000 m) and Arctic Ocean (upper mixed layer and major inflowing branches); Oxygen in the 0-1200 m
layer or oxygen minimum layer; Ocean pH as surface pH (decreasing pH corresponds to increasing ocean acidification). Ecosystems in the ocean: Coral refers to warm-water coral reefs and
cold-water corals. The ‘upper water column’ category refers to epipelagic zone for all ocean regions except Polar Regions, where the impacts on some pelagic organisms in open water deeper
than the upper 200 m were included. Coastal wetland includes salt marshes, mangroves and seagrasses. Kelp forests are habitats of a specific group of macroalgae. Rocky shores are coastal
habitats dominated by immobile calcified organisms such as mussels and barnacles. Deep sea is seafloor ecosystems that are 3000-6000 m deep. Sea-ice associated includes ecosystems
in, on and below sea ice. Habitat services refer to supporting structures and services (e.g., habitat, biodiversity, primary production). Coastal Carbon Sequestration refers to the uptake and
storage of carbon by coastal blue carbon ecosystems. Ecosystems on Land: Tundra refers to tundra and alpine meadows, and includes terrestrial Antarctic ecosystems. Migration refers to an
increase or decrease in net migration, not to beneficial/adverse value. Impacts on tourism refer to the operating conditions for the tourism sector. Cultural services include cultural identity,
sense of home, and spiritual, intrinsic and aesthetic values, as well as contributions from glacier archaeology. The underlying information is given for land regions in tables SM2.6, SM2.7,

"Figure TS.7 | Sea level rise risks and responses. The term response is used here instead of adaptation because some responses, such as retreat, may or may not be
considered to be adaptation. (a) shows the combined risk of coastal flooding, erosion and salinization for illustrative geographies in 2100, due to changing mean and
extreme sea levels under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 and under two response scenarios. Risks under RCPs 4.5 and 6.0 were not assessed due to a lack of literature for the
assessed geographies. The assessment does not account for changes in extreme sea level beyond those directly induced by mean sea level rise; risk levels could increase
if other changes in extreme sea levels were considered (e.g., due to changes in cyclone intensity). Panel (a) considers a socioeconomic scenario with relatively stable
coastal population density over the century. {SM4.3.2} Risks to illustrative geographies have been assessed based on relative sea level changes projected for a set of
specific examples: New York City, Shanghai and Rotterdam for resource-rich coastal cities covering a wide range of response experiences; South Tarawa, Fongafale and
Male’ for urban atoll islands; Mekong and Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna for large tropical agricultural deltas; and Bykovskiy, Shishmaref, Kivalina, Tuktoyaktuk and Shingle
Point for Arctic communities located in regions remote from rapid glacio-isostatic adjustment. {4.2, 4.3.4, SM4.2} The assessment distinguishes between two contrasting
response scenarios. “No-to-moderate response” describes efforts as of today (ie., no further significant action or new types of actions). “Maximum potential response”
represents a combination of responses implemented to their full extent and thus significant additional efforts compared to today, assuming minimal financial, social and
political barriers. The assessment has been conducted for each sea level rise and response scenario, as indicated by the burning embers in the figure; in-between risk levels
are interpolated. {4.3.3} The assessment criteria include exposure and vulnerability (density of assets, level of degradation of terrestrial and marine buffer ecosystems),
coastal hazards (flooding, shoreline erosion, salinization), in-situ responses (hard engineered coastal defenses, ecosystem restoration or creation of new natural buffers
areas, and subsidence management) and planned relocation. Planned relocation refers to managed retreat or resettlement as described in Chapter 4, ie., proactive and
local-scale measures to reduce risk by relocating people, assets and infrastructure. Forced displacement is not considered in this assessment. Panel (a) also highlights the
relative contributions of in-situ responses and planned relocation to the total risk reduction. (b) schematically illustrates the risk reduction (vertical arrows) and risk delay

The assessment of risk transitions is described in Chapter 5 Sections 5.2, 5.3, 5.2.5 and 5.3.7 and Supplementary Materials SM5.3, Table SM5.6, Table SM5.8 and other

acidification, deoxygenation, increased density stratification, changes in carbon fluxes, sea level rise, and increased frequency and/or intensity of extreme events. The
assessment considers the natural adaptive capacity of the ecosystems, their exposure and vulnerability. Impact and risk levels do not consider risk reduction strategies such
as human interventions, or future changes in non-climatic drivers. Risks for ecosystems were assessed by considering biological, biogeochemical, geomorphological and
physical aspects. Higher risks associated with compound effects of climate hazards include habitat and biodiversity loss, changes in species composition and distribution

cryosphere in the Earth system include the uptake and redistribution
of anthropogenic carbon dioxide and heat by the ocean, as well as
their crucial involvement of in the hydrological cycle. The cryosphere
also amplifies climate changes through snow, ice and permafrost
feedbacks. Services provided to people by the ocean and/or
cryosphere include food and freshwater, renewable energy, health

Almost 10% of the global population lives in the Arctic or high
mountain regions. People in these regions face the greatest exposure
to ocean and cryosphere change, and poor and marginalised people
here are particularly vulnerable to climate-related hazards and risks

"In this report, the following summary terms are used to describe the available evidence: limited, medium, or robust; and for the degree of agreement: low, medium or
high. A level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers: very low, low, medium, high and very high, and typeset in italics, for example, medium confidence. For a given
evidence and agreement statement, different confidence levels can be assigned, but increasing levels of evidence and degrees of agreement are correlated with increasing
confidence (see Section 1.9.2 and Figure 1.4 for more details).

In this report, the following terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or a result: Virtually certain 99-100% probability, Very likely 90-100%,
Likely 66-100%, About as likely as not 33-66%, Unlikely 0-33%, Very unlikely 02-10%, and Exceptionally unlikely 0-1%. Additional terms (Extremely likely: 95-100%,
More likely than not >50-100%, and Extremely unlikely 0-5%) may also be used when appropriate. Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics, for example, very likely

on coordinated climate model experiments from the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) forced with Representative
Concentration Pathways (RCPs) of future radiative forcing. Current
emissions continue to grow at a rate consistent with a high emission
future without effective climate change mitigation policies (referred
to as RCP8.5). The SROCC assessment contrasts this high greenhouse

mountains, to the polar regions, to coasts and into the deep reaches
of the ocean. Changes by the end of this century are expected to
be larger under high greenhouse gas emission futures compared
with low-emission futures (Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1), and
inaction on reducing emissions will have large economic costs.
If human impacts on the ocean continue unabated, declines in
ocean health and services are projected to cost the global economy
428 billion USD yr"" by 2050, and 1.979 trillion USD yr’ by 2100.
Alternatively, steps to reduce these impacts could save more than
a trillion dollars USD yr"" by 2100 (Ackerman, 2013). Similarly, sea
level rise scenarios of 25 to 123 cm by 2100 without adaptation
are expected to see 0.2—4.6% of the global population impacted by
coastal flooding annually, with average annual losses amounting
to 0.3-9.3% of global GDP. Investment in adaptation reduces by 2 to
3 orders of magnitude the number of people flooded and the losses
caused (Hinkel et al., 2014).

"Even people living far from the ocean or cryosphere depend on these
systems. Snow and glacier melt from high mountains helps to sustain
the rivers that deliver water resources to downstream populations
(Kaser et al., 2010; Sharma et al., 2019). In the Indus and Ganges river
basins, for example, snow and glacier melt provides enough water to
grow food crops to sustain a balanced diet for 38 million people, and
supports the livelihoods of 129 million farmers (Biemans et al., 2019).
The ocean and cryosphere regulate global climate and weather; the
ocean is the primary source of rain and snowfall needed to sustain
life on land, and uptake of heat and carbon into the ocean has so
far limited the magnitude of anthropogenic warming experienced at
the Earth’s surface (Section 1.2). The ocean's biosphere is responsible
for about half of the primary production on Earth, and around 17%
of the non-grain protein in human diets is derived from the ocean
(FAO, 2018). Communities far from the coast can also be exposed
to changes in the ocean through extreme weather events. Ocean
and cryosphere changes can result in differing consequences and
benefits on local to global scales; for example, declining sea ice in
the Arctic is allowing access to shorter international shipping routes
but restricting traditional sea ice based travel for Arctic communities.

"All people depend directly or indirectly on the ocean and cryosphere

As of 2010, 28% of the global population (1.9 billion people) were
living in areas less than 100 km from the coastline and less than
100 m above sea level, including 17 major cities which are each home
to more than 5 million people (Kummu et al., 2016). Small Island
Developing States are together home to around 65 million people
(UN, 2015a). The low elevation coastal zone (land less than 10 m
above sea level), where people and infrastructure are most exposed
to coastal hazards, is currently home to around 11% of the global
population (around 680 million people), and by 2050 the population
in this zone is projected to grow to more than one billion under all
Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) (Section 4.3.3.2; Merkens
et al., 2016; O'Neill et al., 2017). In 2010, approximately 4 million
people lived in the Arctic (Section 3.5.1), and an increase of only
4% is projected for 2030 (Heleniak, 2014) compared to 16-23%
for the global population increase (O'Neill et al., 2017). Almost 10%
of the global population (around 670 million people) lived in high
mountain regions in 2010, and by 2050 the population in these
regions is expected to grow to between 736-844 million across the
SSPs (Section 2.1). For people living in close contact with the ocean
and cryosphere, these systems provide essential livelihoods, food
security, well-being and cultural identity, but are also a source of

The global ocean is the interconnected body of saline water that encompasses polar to equatorial climate zones and covers 71% of the
Earth surface. It includes the Arctic, Pacific, Atlantic, Indian and Southern Oceans, as well as their marginal seas. The ocean contains

"The ocean is a fundamental climate regulator on seasonal to millennial time scales. Seawater has a heat capacity four times larger
than air and holds vast quantities of dissolved carbon. Heat, water, and biogeochemically relevant gases (e.g., 02 and CO2) exchange

The cryosphere refers to frozen components of the Earth system that are at or below the land and ocean surface. These include snow,
glaciers, ice sheets, ice shelves, icebergs, sea ice, lake ice, river ice, permafrost and seasonally frozen ground. Cryosphere is widespread

in polar regions (Chapter 3) and high mountains (Chapter 2), and changes in the cryosphere can have far-reaching and even global
impacts (Chapters 2 to 6, Cross-Chapter Box 9).

"Snow is common in polar and mountain regions. It can ultimately either melt seasonally or transform into ice layers that build glaciers
and ice sheets. Snow feeds groundwater and river runoff together with glacier melt causes natural hazards (avalanches, rain-on-snow
flood events) and is a critical economic resource for hydropower and tourism. Snow plays a major role in maintaining high mountain

"Coasts are where ocean and land processes interact, and includes coastal cities, deltas, estuaries, and other coastal ecosystems
such as mangrove forests. Low elevation coastal zones (less than 10 m above sea level) are densely populated and particularly exposed
to hazards from the ocean (Chapters 4 to 6, Cross-Chapter Box 9). Moving into the ocean, the continental shelf represents the shallow
ocean areas (depth <200 m) that surround continents and islands, before the seafloor descends at the continental slope into the deep
ocean. The edge of the continental shelf is often used to identify the coastal ocean from the open ocean. Ocean depth and distance from
the coast may influence the governance and economic access that applies to ocean areas (Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1).

"The average depth of the global ocean is about 3,700 m, with a maximum depth of more than 10,000 m. The ocean is vertically
stratified with less dense water sitting above more dense layers, determined by the seawater temperature, salinity and pressure. The
surface of the ocean is in direct contact with the atmosphere, except for sea ice covered regions. Sunlight penetrates the water column
and supports primary production (by phytoplankton) down to 50-200 m depth (epipelagic zone). Atmospheric-driven mixing occurs
from the sea surface and into the mesopelagic zone (200—1,000 m). The distinction between the upper ocean and deep ocean depends
on the processes being considered.

"Ice sheets and glaciers are land-based ice, built up by accumulating snowfall on their surface. Presently, around 10% of Earth's
land area is covered by glaciers or ice sheets, which in total hold about 69% of Earth's freshwater (Gleick, 1996). Ice sheets and
glaciers flow, and at their margins ice and/or melt water is discharged into lakes, rivers or the ocean. The largest ice bodies on Earth
are the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. Marine-based sections of ice sheets (e.g., West Antarctic Ice Sheet) sit upon bedrock that
largely lies below sea level and are in contact with ocean heat, making them vulnerable to rapid and irreversible ice loss. Ice sheets
and glaciers that lose more ice than they accumulate contribute to global sea level rise.

"Permafrost is ground (soil or rock containing ice and frozen organic material) that remains at or below 0°C for at least two consecutive
years. It occurs on land in polar and high mountain areas, and also as submarine permafrost in shallow parts of the Arctic and Southern
Oceans. Permafrost thickness ranges from less than 1 m to greater than 1,000 m. It usually occurs beneath an active layer, which thaws
and freezes annually. Unlike glaciers and snow, the spatial distribution and temporal changes of permafrost cannot easily be observed.
Permafrost thaw can cause hazards, including ground subsidence or landslides, and influence global climate through emissions of
greenhouse gases from microbial breakdown of previously frozen organic carbon.

"Sea ice forms from freezing of seawater, and sea ice on the ocean surface is further thickened by snow accumulation. Sea ice may be
discontinuous pieces moved on the ocean surface by wind and currents (pack ice), or a motionless sheet attached to the coast or to ice
shelves (fast ice). Sea ice provides many critical functions: it provides essential habitat for polar species and supports the livelihoods
of people in the Arctic (including Indigenous peoples); regulates climate by reflecting solar radiation; inhibits ocean-atmosphere
exchange of heat, momentum and gases (including C02); supports global deep ocean circulation via dense (cold and salty) water
formation; and aids or hinders transportation and travel routes in the polar regions.

"The ocean and cryosphere are interconnected in a multitude of ways
(Box 1.1, Figure 1). Evaporation from the ocean provides snowfall
that builds and sustains the ice sheets and glaciers that store large
amounts of frozen water on land (Section 4.2.1). The vast ice sheets
in Antarctica and Greenland currently hold about 66 m of potential
global sea level rise (Fretwell et al., 2013), although the loss of a large
fraction of this potential would require millennia of ice sheet retreat.
Ocean temperature and sea level affect ice sheet, glacier and ice shelf
stability in places where the base of ice bodies are in direct contact
with ocean water (Section 3.3.1). The nonlinear response of ice-melt
to ocean temperature changes means that even slight increases in
ocean temperature have the potential to rapidly melt and destabilise
large sections of an ice sheet or ice shelf (Section 3.3.1.5).

"Water is exchanged between the ocean, atmosphere, land and
cryosphere as part of the hydrological cycle driven by solar heating
(Box 1.1, Figure 1; Trenberth et al., 2007; Lagerloef et al, 2010; Durack
et al., 2016). Evaporation from the surface ocean is the main source of
water in the atmosphere, which is moved back to the Earth's surface
as precipitation (Gimeno et al., 2012). The hydrological cycle is closed
by the eventual return of water to the ocean by rivers, streams, and
groundwater flow, and through ice discharge and melting of ice
sheets and glaciers (Yu, 2018). Hydrological extremes related to
the ocean include floods from extreme rainfall (including tropical
cyclones) or ocean circulation-related droughts (Sections 6.3, 6.5),
while cryosphere-related flooding can be caused by rapid snow melt
and melt water discharge events (Sections 2.3, 3.4).

"The formation of sea ice leads to the production of dense ocean
water that contributes to the deep ocean circulation (Section 3.3.3.2).
Paleoclimate evidence and modelling indicates that releases of large
amounts of glacier and ice sheet melt water into the surface ocean
can disrupt deep overturning circulation of the ocean, causing global
climate impacts (Knutti et al., 2004; Golledge et al., 2019). Ice sheet
melt water in the Antarctic may cause changes in surface ocean
salinity, stratification and circulation, that feedback to generate
further ocean-driven melting of marine-based ice sheets (Golledge
et al., 2019) and promote sea ice formation (Purich et al., 2018).
The cryosphere and ocean further link through the movement of
biogeochemical nutrients. For example, iron accumulated in sea ice
during winter is released to the ocean during the spring and summer
melt, helping to fuel ocean productivity in the seasonal sea ice zone
(Tagliabue et al., 2017). Nutrient rich sediments delivered by glaciers
further connect cryosphere processes to ocean productivity (Arrigo
et al., 2017).

"During an equilibrium (stable) climate state, the amount of incoming
solar energy is balanced by an equal amount of outgoing radiation
at the top of Earth’s atmosphere (Hansen et al., 2011). At the Earth’s
surface energy from the Sun is transformed into various forms (heat,
potential, latent, kinetic, and chemical), that drive weather systems
in the atmosphere and currents in the ocean, fuel photosynthesis
on land and in the ocean, and fundamentally determine the climate
(Trenberth et al., 2014). The ocean has a large capacity to store
and release heat, and the Earth’s energy budget can be effectively
monitored through the heat content of the ocean on time scales
longer than one year (Palmer and McNeall, 2014; von Schuckmann
et al., 2016; Cheng et al., 2018). The large heat capacity of the ocean
leads to different characteristics of the ocean response to external
forcings compared with the atmosphere (Sections 1.3, 1.4). The
reflective properties of snow and ice also play an important role in
regulating climate via the albedo effect. Increased amounts of solar
energy are absorbed when snow or ice are replaced by less reflective
land or ocean surfaces, resulting in a climate change feedback
responsible for amplified changes.

Time Scales, Thresholds and Detection
of Ocean and Cryosphere Change
"	Title
"It takes hundreds of years to millennia for the entire deep ocean
to turn over (Matsumoto, 2007; Gebbie and Huybers, 2012), while
renewal of the large ice sheets requires many thousands of years
(Huybrechts and de Wolde, 1999). Long response times mean that
the deep ocean and the large ice sheets tend to lag behind in their
response to the rapidly changing climate at Earth’s surface, and that
they will continue to change even after radiative forcing stabilises
(e.g., Golledge et al, 2015; Figure 1.1a). Such ‘committed’ changes
mean that some ocean and cryosphere changes are essentially
irreversible on time scales relevant to human societies (decades to
centuries), even in the presence of immediate action to limit further
global warming (e.g., Section 4.2.3.5).
"	Text
"While some aspects of the ocean and cryosphere might respond
in a linear (i.e., directly proportional) manner to a perturbation
by some external forcing, this may change fundamentally when
critical thresholds are reached. A very important example for such a
threshold is the transition from frozen water to liquid water at around
0°C that can lead to rapid acceleration of ice-melt or permafrost
thaw (e.g., Abram et al., 2013; Trusel et al., 2018). Such thresholds
often act as tipping points, as they are associated with rapid and
abrupt changes even when the underlying forcing changes gradually
(Figure 1.1a, 1.1¢). Tipping elements include, for example, the collapse
of the ocean's large-scale overturning circulation in the Atlantic
(Section 6.7), or the collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet though
a process called marine ice sheet instability (Cross-Chapter Box 8
in Chapter 3; Lenton et al, 2008). Potential ocean and cryosphere
tipping elements form part of the scientific case for efforts to limit
climate warming to well below 2°C (IPCC, 2018).
"	Text
"Anthropogenically forced change occurs against a backdrop of
substantial natural variability (Figure 1.1b). The anthropogenic signal
is already detectable in global surface air temperature and several
other climate variables, including ocean temperature and salinity
(IPCC, 2014), but short observational records and large year-to-
year variability mean that formal detection is not yet the case for
many expected ocean and cryosphere changes (Jones et al., 2016).
‘Time of Emergence’ refers to the time when anthropogenic change
signals emerge from the background noise of natural variability in a
pre-defined reference period Hawkins and Sutton, 2012; (Figure 1.1b;
Section 5.2, Box 5.1). For some variables, (e.g., for those associated
with ocean acidification), the current signals emerge from this natural
variability within a few decades, whereas for others, such as primary
production and expected Antarctic-wide sea ice decline, the signal
may not emerge for many more decades even under high emission
scenarios (Collins et al., 2013; Keller et al., 2014; Rodgers et al., 2015;
Frélicher et al., 2016; Jones et al., 2016).
"	Text
"‘Detection and Attribution’ assesses evidence for past changes in
the ocean and cryosphere, relative to normal/reference-interval
conditions (detection), and the extent to which these changes have
been caused by anthropogenic climate change or by other factors
(attribution) (Bindoff et al., 2013; Cramer et al., 2014; Knutson et al.,
2017; Figure 1.1d). Reliable detection and attribution is fundamental
to our understanding of the scientific basis of climate change (Hegerl
et al, 2010). For example, the main attribution conclusion of the
IPCC 4th Assessment Report (AR4), in other words, that ‘most of the
observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th
century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic
greenhouse gas concentrations’, has had a strong impact on climate
policy (Petersen, 2011). In ARS this attribution statement was elevated
to ‘extremely likely’ (Bindoff et al., 2013). Statistical approaches for
attribution often involve using contrasting forcing scenarios in climate
model experiments to detect the forcing that best explains an observed
change (Figure 1.1d). In addition to passing the statistical test, a
successful attribution also requires a firm process understanding.
Confident attribution remains challenging though, especially when
there are multiple or confounding factors that influence the state
of a system (Hegerl et al, 2010). Particular challenges to detection
and attribution in the ocean and cryosphere include the often
short observational records (Section 1.8.1.1, Figure 1.3), which are
particularly confounding given the long adjustment time scales to
anthropogenic forcing of many properties of interest.

"Extreme climate events (e.g., marine heatwaves or storm surges) push
a system to near or beyond the ends of its normally observed range
(Seneviratne et al., 2012; Figure 1.1b; Chapter 6;). Extremes can be
very costly in terms of loss of life, ecosystem destruction, and economic
damage. In a system affected by climate change, the recurrence and
intensity of these extreme events can change much faster and have
greater impacts than changes of the average system state (Easterling
et al., 2000; Parmesan et al., 2000; Hughes et al., 2018). Of particular
concern are ‘compound events’, when the joint probability of two or
more properties of a system is extreme at the same time or closely
connected in time and space (Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1;
Sections 4.3.4, 6.8). Such a compound event is given, for example,
when marine heatwaves co-occur with very low nutrient levels in the
ocean potentially resulting in extreme impacts (Bond et al., 2015). The
interconnectedness of the ocean and cryosphere (Section 1.2.2) can
also lead to cascading effects where changes in one element trigger
secondary changes in completely different but connected elements
of the systems, including its socioeconomic aspects. (Figure 1.1e). An
example is the large change in ocean productivity triggered by the
changes in circulation and iron inputs induced by the large outflow of
melt waters from Greenland (Kanna et al., 2018). New methodologies
for attributing extreme events and the risks they bring to climate
change have emerged since ARS (Trenberth et al., 2015; Stott et al.,
2016; Kirchmeier-Young et al., 2017; Otto, 2017), especially also for
the attribution of individual events through an assessment of the
fraction of attributable risk (Figure 1.1f).

"By 2011, the ocean had taken up about 30 + 7% of the anthropogenic
CO that had been released to the atmosphere since the industrial
revolution (Ciais et al., 2013; Section 5.2). In response, ocean pH
decreased by 0.1 since the beginning of the industrial era (high
confidence), corresponding to an increase in acidity of 26% (Table
SM1.1) and leading to both positive and negative biological and
ecological impacts (high confidence) (Gattuso et al., 2014). Evidence
is increasing that the ocean's oxygen content is declining (Oschlies
et al., 2018). AR5 did not come to a final conclusion with regard
to potential long-term changes in ocean productivity due to short
observational records and divergent scientific evidence (Boyd et al.,

"Since the onset of the industrial revolution, human activities have
had a strong impact on the climate system, including the ocean
and cryosphere. Human activities have altered the external forcings
acting on Earth's climate (Myhre et al., 2013) by changes in land
use (albedo), and changes in atmospheric aerosols (e.g., soot)
from the burning of biomass and fossil fuels. Most significantly,
human activities have led to an accumulation of greenhouse gases
(including COz) in the atmosphere as a result of the burning of fossil
fuels, cement production, agriculture and land use change. In 2016,
the global average atmospheric CO2 concentration crossed 400 parts
per million, a level Earth's atmosphere did not experience for at least
the past 800,000 years and possibly much longer (Lithi et al., 2008;
Fischer et al., 2018). These anthropogenic forcings have not only
warmed the ocean and begun to melt the cryosphere, but have also
led to widespread biogeochemical changes driven by the oceanic
uptake of anthropogenic CO2 from the atmosphere (IPCC, 2013).

in the Earth system (Section 1.2) and as reported since 1970, there

(IPCC, 2013). Mean ocean surface temperature has increased since the
1970s at a rate of 0.11 (0.09-0.13)°C per decade (high confidence),
and forms part of a long-term warming of the surface ocean since
the mid-19th century. The upper ocean (0-700 m, virtually certain)
and intermediate ocean (700 to 2,000 m, likely) have warmed since
the 1970s. Ocean heat uptake has continued unabated since AR5
(Sections 3.2.1.2.1, 5.2), increasing the risk of marine heat waves and
other extreme events (Section 6.4). During the 21st century, ocean
warming is projected to continue even if anthropogenic greenhouse
gas emissions cease (Sections 1.3, 5.2). The global water cycle has
been altered, resulting in substantial regional changes in sea surface

cycles; robust detection was not yet possible in 1990, but has been
characterised as unequivocal since AR4 in 2007. Projections of
near-term warming rates in early reports have been realised over
the subsequent decades, while projections have tended to err on the
side of caution for sea level rise and ocean heat uptake that have
developed faster than predicted (Brysse et al., 2013; Section 4.2,

not observable are now emerging. The expected acceleration of sea
level rise is now observed with high confidence (Section 4.2). There
is emerging evidence in sustained observations and from long-term
palaeoclimate reconstructions for the expected slow-down of AMOC

(Section 6.7). Significant sea level rise contributions from Antarctic
ice sheet mass loss (very high confidence), which earlier reports
did not expect to manifest this century, are already being observed

The word representative signifies that each RCP provides only one of many possible pathways that would lead to the specific radiative

Assessing the future risks and opportunities that climate change will bring for the ocean and cryosphere, and for their dependent
ecosystems and human communities, is a main objective of this report. However, the future is inherently uncertain. A well-established
methodological approach that the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) report uses to assess
the future under these uncertainties is through scenario analysis (Kainuma et al. 2018). The ultimate physical driver of the ocean and
cryosphere changes that SROCC assesses are greenhouse gas emissions, while the exposure to hazards and the future risks to natural
and human systems are also shaped social, economic and governance factors (Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1; Section 1.5). This
Cross-Chapter Box introduces the main scenarios that are used in the SROCC assessment. Examples of key climate change indicators

and reasonably comprehensive remote-sensing cryosphere data (Section 1.8.1), and aligns this report with a more current reference
than the 1986-2005 reference adopted by ARS. This 10-year present day period is short relative to natural variability. However, at this
decadal scale the bias in the present day interval due to natural variability is generally small compared to differences between present
day conditions and the pre-industrial baseline. There is also no indication of global average surface temperature in either 1986-2005 or
2006-2015 being substantially biased by short-term variability (Allen et al., 2018), consistent with the ARS finding that each of the last

A baseline provides a reference period from which changes can be evaluated. In the context of anthropogenic climate change, the
baseline should ideally approximate the ‘pre-industrial’ conditions before significant human influences on the climate began. The IPCC
5th Assessment Report (AR5) and SR15 (Allen et al., 2018) use 1850-1900 as the pre-industrial baseline for assessing historical and
future climate change. Atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and global surface temperatures had already begun to rise in this
interval from early industrialisation (Abram et al., 2016; Hawkins et al., 2017; Schurer et al., 2017). However, the scarcity of reliable
climate observations represents a major challenge for quantifying earlier pre-industrial states (Hawkins et al., 2017). To maintain
consistency across IPCC reports, the 1850-1900 pre-industrial baseline is used wherever possible in SROCC, recognising that this is a
compromise between data coverage and representativeness of typical pre-industrial conditions.

"Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) complement the RCPs with varying socioeconomic challenges to adaptation and mitigation
(e.g., population, economic growth, education, urbanisation and the rate of technological development; O'Neill et al., 2017). The SSPs
describe five alternative socioeconomic futures comprising: sustainable development (SSP1), middle-of-the-road development (SSP2),
regional rivalry (SSP3), inequality (SSP4), and fossil-fuelled development (SSP5; Figure SM1.1; Kriegler et al., 2016; Riahi et al., 2017).
The RCPs set plausible pathways for greenhouse gas concentrations and the climate changes that could occur, and the SSPs set the
stage on which reductions in emissions will or will not be achieved within the context of the underlying socioeconomic characteristics
and shared policy assumptions of that world. The combination of SSP-based socioeconomic scenarios and RCP-based climate
projections provides an integrative frame for climate impact and policy analysis. The SSPs will be included in the CMIP6 simulations to
be assessed in AR6 (O'Neill et al., 2016). In SROCC, the SSPs are used only for contextualising estimates from the literature on varying
future populations in regions exposed to ocean and cryosphere changes.

"Four RCPs were used for projections of the future climate in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) (Taylor et al.,
2012). They are identified by their approximate anthropogenic radiative forcing (in W m~, relative to 1750) by 2100: RCP2.6, RCP4.5,
RCP6.0, and RCP8.5 (Figure SM1.1). RCP8.5 is a high greenhouse gas emission scenario without effective climate change mitigation
policies, leading to continued and sustained growth in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations (Riahi et al., 2011). RCP2.6
represents a low greenhouse gas emission, high mitigation future that gives a two in three chance of limiting global atmospheric
surface warming to below 2°C by the end of the century (van Vuuren et al., 2011b; Collins et al., 2013; Allen et al., 2018). Achieving the
RCP2.6 pathway would require implementation of negative emissions technologies at a not-yet-proven scale to remove greenhouse
gases from the air, in addition to other mitigation strategies such as energy from sustainable sources and existing nature-based
strategies (Gasser et al., 2015; Sanderson et al., 2016; Royal Society, 2018; National Academies of Sciences, 2019). An even more
stringent RCP1.9 pathway is considered most compatible with limiting global warming to below 1.5°C, called a 1.5°C-consistent
pathway in the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR15; O'Neill et al, 2016; IPCC, 2018), and will be assessed in the IPCC
6th Assessment Report (AR6) using projections of Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Global fossil
C02 emissions rose more than 2% in 2018 and 1.6% in 2017, after a temporary slowdown in emissions from 2014-2016. Current
emissions continue to grow in line with the RCP8.5 trajectory (Peters et al., 2012; Le Quéré et al., 2018).

"Beyond mitigation, adaptation is a key avenue to reduce risk (Section 1.6). Adaptation can also include exploiting new opportunities;
however, this box focuses on risk, and thus, the latter is not discussed in detail here. Adaptation efforts link into the causal fabric of
risk by reducing existing and future vulnerability, exposure, and/or (where possible) hazards (Figure CB2.1). Addressing the different
risk components (hazards, exposure and vulnerability) involves assessing and selecting options for policy.

"‘Human systems’ include physiological, health, socio-cultural,
belief, technological, economic, food, political, and legal systems,

et al., 2011; Watt-Cloutier, 2018) for many millennia (Redman, 1999).
Contemporary human populations still depend directly on elements
of the ocean and cryosphere, and the ecosystem services they provide,
but at a much larger scale and with greater environmental impact
than in pre-industrial times (Inniss and Simcock, 2017).

SROCC considers risk from climate change-related effects on the ocean and cryosphere as the result of the interaction between:
(1) environmental hazards triggered by climate change, (2) exposure of humans, infrastructure and ecosystems to those hazards,
and (3) systems’ vulnerabilities. Risk refers to the potential for adverse consequences, and impacts refer to materialised effects
of climate change. Next to assessing risk and impacts specifically resulting from climate change-related effects on the ocean, coast and
cryosphere, SROCC is also concerned with the options to reduce climate-related risk.

"The ocean and cryosphere are unique systems that have intrinsic
value, including the ecosystems and biodiversity they support.
Frameworks of Ecosystem Services and Nature's Contributions to
People are both used within SROCC to assess the impacts of changes
in the ocean and cryosphere on humans directly, and through changes
to the ecosystems that support human life and civilisations (Sections
2.3, 3.4.3.2, 4.3.3.5, 5.4, 6.4, 6.5, 6.8). The Millennium Ecosystem
Assessment (MEA, 2005) established a conceptual Ecosystem
Services framework between biodiversity, human well-being, and
drivers of change. This framework highlights that natural systems
provide vital life-support services to humans and the planet, including
direct material services (e.g., food, timber), non-material services
(eg., cultural continuity, health), and many services that regulate
environmental status (e.g., soil formation, water purification). This
framework supports decision-making by quantifying benefits for
valuation and trade-off analyses. The Ecosystem Services framework
has been challenged as monetising the relationships of people with
nature, and undervaluing small-scale livelihoods, cultural values and
other considerations that contribute little to global commerce (Diaz
et al., 2018). More recent frameworks, such as Nature’s Contributions
to People (Diaz et al., 2018), used in the Intergovernmental Platform
on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services assessments (IPBES), aim to
better encompass the non-commercial ways that nature contributes
to human quality of life.

"Figure CB2.1| There are options for risk reduction through adaptation. Adaptation can reduce risk by addressing one or more of the three risk factors: vulnerability,
exposure, and/or hazard. The reduction of vulnerability, exposure, and/or hazard potential can be achieved through different policy and action choices over time until
limits to adaptation might be reached. The figure builds on the conceptual framework of risk used in the IPCC 5th Assessment Report (AR5) (Oppenheimer et al., 2014).

responses are more effective when they promote resilience to climate change, consider plausible futures and unexpected events,
strengthen essential or desired characteristics as well as values of the responding system and/or make adjustments to avoid
unsustainable pathways (high agreement, medium evidence; Section 2.3; Box 2.4; 4.4.4; 4.4.5).

"Adaptation requires adaptive capacity, which for human systems includes assets (financial, physical, and/or ecological), capital (social
and institutional), knowledge and technical know-how (Klein et al., 2014). The extent of adaptive capacity determines adaptation
potential, but does not necessarily translate into effective adaptation if awareness of the need to act, the willingness to act and/or the
cooperation needed to act is lacking (high confidence; Sections 2.3; Box 2.4; 4.3.2.6.3; 5.5.2.4).

"Residual risks (i.e., the risk that endures following adaptation and risk reduction efforts) remain even where adaptation is possible

"There are limits to adaptation, which include, for example, physical, ecological, technological, economic, political, institutional,
psychological and/or socio-cultural aspects (medium evidence, high agreement) (Dow et al., 2013; Barnett et al, 2014; Klein et al.,
2014). For example, the ability to adapt to sea level rise depends, in part, on the elevation of the low-lying islands and coasts in
question, but also on the capacity to successfully negotiate protection or relocation measures socially and politically (Cross-Chapter
Box 9, also see Section 6.4.3 for a wider overview). Limits to adaptation are sometimes considered as something different from
barriers to adaptation. Barriers can in principle be overcome if adaptive capacity is available (e.g., where funding is made available),
even though overcoming barriers is often hard in reality, particularly for resource-poor communities and countries (high confidence;
Section 4.4.3). Limits to adaptation are reached when adaptation no longer allows an actor or ecosystem to secure valued objectives
or key functions from intolerable risks (Section 4.4.2; Dow et al., 2013). Defining tolerable risks and key system functions is, therefore,
of central importance for the assessment of limits to adaptation.

"Applying the concept of resilience in mitigation and adaptation planning builds the capacity of a social-ecological system to navigate
anticipated changes and unexpected events (Biggs et al., 2012; Varma et al., 2014; Sud et al, 2015). Resilience also emphasises
social-ecological system dynamics, including the possibility of crossing critical thresholds and experiencing a regime shift (ie., state
change). Seven general strategies for building social-ecological resilience have been identified (Figure CB2.2; Ostrom, 2010; Biggs
et al., 2012; Quinlan et al., 2016). The concept of resilience also allows analysts, accessors of risk and decision makers to recognise
how climate-change related risks often cannot be fully avoided or alleviated despite adaptation. For SROCC, this is especially relevant
along low-lying coasts, high mountain areas and the polar regions (medium evidence, high agreement; Sections 2.3; 2.4; 3.5, 6.8, 6.9).

Addressing climate change-related risk, impacts (including extreme events and shocks) and trade-offs together with shaping the
trajectories of social and ecological systems is facilitated by considering resilience (Biggs et al., 2012; Quinlan et al., 2016). In SROCC,
resilience is understood as the capacity of interconnected social, economic and ecological systems to cope with disturbances by
reorganising in ways that maintain their essential function, structure, and identity (Walker et al., 2004). Resilience may be considered
as a positive attribute of a system and an aspirational goal when it contributes to the capacity for adaptation and learning without
changing the structure, function, and identity of the system (Walker et al., 2004; Steiner, 2015). Alternately, resilience may be used
descriptively as a system property that is neither good nor bad (Walker et al., 2004; Chapin et al., 2009; Weichselgartner and Kelman,
2014). For example, a system can be highly resilient in keeping its unfavoured attributes, such as poverty or institutional rigidity
(Carpenter and Brock, 2008). Critics of the resilience concept warn that the application of resilience to social systems is problematic
when the responsibility for resilience building is shifted onto the shoulders of vulnerable and resource-poor populations (e.g., Chandler,
2013; Reid, 2013; Rigg and Oven, 2015; Tierney, 2015; Olsson et al., 2017).

trends of changing habitat due to climate change are reported for
the cryosphere (Sections 2.2, 3.4.3.2). The risk of irreversible loss of
many marine and coastal ecosystems increases with global warming,
especially at 2°C or more (high confidence; IPCC, 2018). Risk also
increases for habitat displacements, both poleward (Section 3.2.4)

CRDPs are a relatively new concept to describe climate change mitigation and adaptation trajectories that strengthen sustainable
development and efforts to eradicate poverty and reduce inequalities while promoting fair and cross-scalar adaptation to, and
resilience in, a changing climate (Kainuma et al., 2018; Roy et al., 2018). CRDPs are increasingly being explored as an approach
for combining scientific assessments, stakeholder participation, and forward-looking development planning, acknowledging that
pursuing CRDP is not only a technical challenge of risk management but also a social and political process (Roy et al, 2018). Adaptive
decision-making over time is key to CRDPs (Haasnoot et al., 2013; Wise et al., 2014; Fazey et al., 2016; Ramm et al., 2017; Bloemen
et al., 2018; Lawrence et al., 2018). CRDPs accommodate both the interacting cultural, social, and ecosystem factors that influence
multi-stakeholder decision making processes, and the overall sustainability of adaptation measures.
"	Text
"Adequate climate change mitigation and adaptation allows for opportunities for sustainable development pathways and the options for
resilience building. CRDPs involve series of mitigation and adaptation choices over time, balancing short-term and long-term goals
and accommodating newly available knowledge (Denton et al., 2014). The CRDPs approach has been successfully used, for example,
in urban, remote and disadvantaged communities, and can showcase the potential to counter maladaptive choices (e.g., Barnett et al.,
2014; Butler et al., 2014; Maru et al., 2014). CRDPs aim to establish narratives of hope and opportunity that can extend beyond risk
reduction and coping (Amundsen et al., 2018). Although climate change impacts on the ocean and cryosphere elicit many emotions,
including fear, anger, despair and apathy (Cunsolo Willox et al., 2013; Cunsolo and Landman, 2017; Cunsolo and Ellis, 2018), narratives
of hope are critical in provoking motivation, creative thinking and behavioural changes in response to climate change (Myers et al.,
2012; Smith and Leiserowitz, 2014; Feldman and Hart, 2016; Feldman and Hart, 2018; Prescott and Logan, 2018; Section 1.8.3).
"	Text
"Much of the adaptation and resilience literature published since AR5 highlights the need for transformations that enable effective climate
change mitigation (most notably, to decarbonise the economy) (Riahi et al., 2017), and support adaptation (e.g., Pelling et al., 2015;
Few et al., 2017). Transformation becomes particularly relevant when existing mitigation and adaptation practices cannot reduce risks
and impacts to an acceptable level. Transformative adaptation, therefore, involves fundamental modifications of policies, policy making
processes, institutions, human behaviour and cultural values (Pelling et al, 2015; Solecki et al., 2017). Successful transformation
requires attention to conditions that allow for such changes, including timing (e.g., windows of opportunity), social readiness (e.g.,
some level of willingness) and resources to act (e.g., trust, human skill and financial resources; Kofinas et al, 2013; Moore et al., 2014).
Examples related to SROCC include shifting from a paradigm of protection reliant on seawalls to living with saltwater as a response
to coastal flooding in rural areas (Renaud et al., 2015) or involving fundamental risk management changes in coastal megacities,
including retreat (Solecki et al., 2017). Transformation in changing ocean and cryosphere contexts can be fostered by transdisciplinary
collaboration between actors in science, government, the private sector, civil society and affected communities (Padmanabhan, 2017;
Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1; Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 1).

Arctic climate warming (e.g., Pistone et al., 2014) that then locally
increases surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet (Liu et al., 2016;
Stroeve et al., 2017). Additionally, ice loss from ice sheets contribute
to the global-scale exposure of sea level rise, and more local-scale
modifications and losses of coastal habitats and ecosystems (Sections
3.2.3 and 4.3.3.5). Interactions within and between natural systems also
influence the spatial reach of risks associated with cryosphere change.
Permafrost degradation, for example, interacts with ecosystems and
climate on various spatial and temporal scales, and feedbacks from
these interactions range from local impacts on topography, hydrology
and biology, to global-scale impacts via biogeochemical cycling (e.g.,
methane release) on climate (Sections 2.2, 2.3, 3.4; Kokelj et al, 2015;

"Climate change impacts on the ocean and cryosphere can also
present opportunities, in at least the near- and medium-term. For
example, in Nepal warming of high mountain environments and
accelerated melting of snow and ice have extended the growing
season and crop yields in some regions (Section 2.3; Gaire et al.,
2015; Merrey et al., 2018), while tourism and shipping has increased
in the Arctic with loss of sea ice (Section 3.2.4). Moreover, rising
ocean temperatures redistribute the global fish population, allowing
new fishing opportunities while reducing some established fisheries
(Bell et al., 2011; Fenichel et al., 2016; Section 5.4). To gain from new
opportunities, while also avoiding or mitigating new or increasing
hazards, it is necessary to be aware of trade-offs between risks and
benefits to understand who is and is not benefiting. For example,
opportunities can involve trade-offs with mitigation and/or SDGs
(Section 3.5.2), and the balance of economic costs and benefits may
differ substantially between the near-term and long-term future

such as inundation and salinisation (Section 4.3), ocean acidification

dramatically altering ecosystem structure and function in the coastal

rising ocean temperature and acidification (Section 5.3.4). Increasing
exposure to climate change hazards in open ocean natural systems

"Changes in the ocean and cryosphere bring hazards that affect the
health, wellbeing, safety and security of populations in coastal,
mountain and polar environments (Section 2.3.5, 3.4.3, 4.3.2). Some
impacts are direct, such as sea level rise or coastal erosion that can
displace coastal residents (4.3.2.3, 4.4.2.6, Box 4.1). Other effects are
indirect; for example, rising ocean temperatures have led to increases
in maximum wind speed and rainfall rates in tropical cyclones
(Section 6.3), creating hazards with severe consequences for natural
and human systems (Sections 4.3, 6.2, 6.3, 6.8). The multiple category
4 and 5 Atlantic hurricanes in 2017 caused the loss of over 3300 lives
and more than 350 billion USD in economic damages (Cross-Chapter
Box 9; Andrade et al., 2018; Murakami et al., 2018; NOAA, 2018). In
mountain regions, glacial lake outburst floods have caused severe
impacts on lives, livelihoods and infrastructure that often extend
beyond the directly affected areas (Section 2.3.2 and 6.2.2). Some
hazards related to ocean and cryosphere change involve abrupt
and irreversible changes (Section 1.3), which generate sometimes
unpredictable risks, and multiple hazards can coincide to greatly
elevate the total risk (Section 6.8.2). For example, combinations of
thawing permafrost, sea level rise, loss of sea ice, ocean surface waves
and extreme weather events (Thomson and Rogers, 2014; Ford et al.,
2017) have damaged Arctic infrastructure (e.g., buildings, roads)
(AMAP, 2015; AMAP, 2017), impacted reindeer husbandry livelihoods
for Sami and other Arctic Indigenous peoples and impeded access to
hunting grounds, other communities and travel routes fundamental
to the livelihoods, food security and wellbeing of Inuit and other
Northern cultures (Section 3.4.3). In some Arctic regions, tipping
points may have already been reached such that adaptive practices
can no longer work (Section 3.5).

However, even populations with greater wealth and privilege can be

to climate change as well as deterioration of ecosystem services. For
example, about half of species assessed on the northeast United States
continental shelf exhibited high to very high climate vulnerability due
to temperature preferences and changes in habitat space (Hare et al.,
2016), with corresponding northward range shifts for many species
(Kleisner et al., 2017) and increased vulnerability for organisms or
ecosystems unable to migrate or evolve at the rate required to adapt
to ocean and cryosphere changes (Miller et al., 2018). Non-climatic
pressures also magnify the vulnerability of ocean and cryosphere
ecosystems to climate-related changes, such as overfishing, coastal
development, and pollution, including plastic pollution (Halpern et al.,
2008; Halpern et al., 2015; IPBES, 2018a; IPBES, 2018b; IPBES, 2018c;
IPBES, 2018d). Conventional (fossil fuel-based) plastics produced in

"Effective and ambitious mitigation of climate change would be required

change impacts on the ocean and cryosphere is necessary to enable
CRDPs that minimise residual risk, and loss and damage (very high
confidence; Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1; IPCC, 2018). Mitigation
refers to human actions to limit climate change by reducing the
emissions and enhancing the sinks of greenhouse gases. Adaptation
refers to processes of adjustment by natural or human systems to actual
or expected climate and its effects, intended to moderate harm or
exploit beneficial opportunities. The presidency of the 23rd Conference
Of the Parties of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) introduced the oceans pathway into the climate
solution space, acknowledging both the importance of the ocean in
the climate system and that ocean commitments for adaptation and
mitigation are available through Nationally Determined Contributions
under the UNFCCC (Gallo et al., 2017).

mitigation measures have trade-offs, with the greatest benefits
derived by combining global and local measures (high confidence;
Gattuso et al., 2018). Local measures, such as pollution reduction and
conservation, provide significant co-benefits and few adverse side
effects (high confidence; Sections 5.5.1, 5.5.2). They can be relatively
rapidly implemented, but are generally less effective in addressing
the global problem (high confidence; Sections 5.5.1, 5.5.2). Likewise,
local efforts to decrease air pollution near mountain glaciers and
other cryosphere components, for example reducing black carbon
emissions, can bring regional-scale benefits for health and in reducing
snow and ice-melt (Shindell et al., 2012; Box 2.2).

"Well-chosen human interventions can enhance the adaptive capacity
of natural systems to climate change. Such interventions through
manipulating an ecosystem’s structural or functional properties
(eg., restoration of mangroves) may minimise climate change
pressures, enhance natural resilience and/or re-direct ecosystem
responses to reduce cascading risks on societies. In human systems,
adaptation can involve both infrastructure (e.g., enhanced sea
defences) and community-based action (e.g., changes in policies
and practices). Adaptation options to ongoing climate change are
most effective when considered together with mitigation strategies
because there are limits to effective adaptation, mitigation actions
can make adaptation more difficult, and some adaptation measures
may increase greenhouse gas emissions.

"Adaptation and mitigation decisions are connected with economic
concerns. In SROCC, two main economic approaches are used. The
first comprises the Total Economic Value method and the valuation
of ecosystem services. SROCC considers the paradigm of sustainable
development, and the linkages between climate impacts on ecosystem
services (Section 5.4.1) and the consequences on SDGs including food
security or poverty eradication (Section 5.4.2). The second economic
approach used are formal decision analysis methods, which help to
identify options (also called alternatives) that perform best or well
with regards to given objectives. These methods include cost-benefit
analysis, multi-criteria analysis and robust decision-making and are
specifically relevant for appraising long-term investment decisions in

including solar radiation management and several other forms of
carbon dioxide removal, but these are not addressed in SROCC as
they are covered in other products of the IPCC Sixth Assessment

the ocean and the cryosphere (Figure 1.2) by supporting biological

organic carbon pollution (which moderates ocean acidification in

"There are several human adaptation options for climate change

nature- and ecosystem-based approaches (Renaudetal., 2016; Serpetti

adaptation range from community-based and infrastructure-based
approaches to managed retreat, along with other forms of internal
migration (Black et al., 2011; Hino et al., 2017). Building on AR5 (Wong
et al., 2014), Chapter 4 describes four main modes of adaptation to
mean and extreme sea level rise: protect, advance, accommodate,
and retreat. This report demonstrates that all modes of adaptation
include mixes of institutional, individual, socio-cultural, engineering,
behavioural and/or ecosystem-based measures (e.g., Section 4.4.2).

across spatial and social scales is influenced by their social
acceptance, political feasibility, cost-efficiency, co-benefits and
trade-offs (Jones et al., 2012; Adger et al., 2013; Eriksen et al., 2015).
Scientific evaluation of past successes and future options, including
understanding barriers, limits, risks and opportunities, are complex
and inadequately researched (Magnan and Ribera, 2016). In the end,
adaptation priorities will depend on multiple parameters including
the extent and rate of climate change, the risk attitudes and social
preferences of individuals and institutions (and the returns they may
gain) (Adger et al., 2009; Briigger et al., 2015; Evans et al., 2016; Neef

"In ARS, a range of changes in ocean and cryosphere natural systems
were linked with medium to high confidence to pressures associated
with climate change (Cramer et al, 2014). Climate change impacts
on natural ecosystems are variable in space and time. The multiplicity
of pressures these natural systems experience impedes attribution
of population or ecosystem responses to a specific ocean and/or
cryosphere change. Moreover, the interconnectivity of populations
within ecosystems means that a single ‘adaptive response’ of a
population, or the aggregate response of an ecosystem (the adaptive
responses of the interconnected populations), is influenced not just
by direct pressures of climate change, but occurs in concert with
the adaptive responses of other species in the ecosystem, further
complicating efforts to disentangle specific patterns of adaptation.
"	Text
"Since ARS, transformational adaptation (i.e., the need for fundamental
changes in private and public institutions and flexible decision-making
processes to face climate change consequences) has been
increasingly studied (Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1). The recent
literature documents how societies, institutions, and/or individuals
increasingly assume a readiness to engage in transformative change,
via their acceptance and promotion of fundamental alterations
in natural or human systems (Klinsky et al., 2016). People living in
and near coastal, mountain and polar environments often pioneer
these types of transformations, since they are at the forefront of
ocean and cryosphere change (e.g., Solecki et al., 2017). Community
led and indigenous led adaptation research continues to burgeon
(Ayers and Forsyth, 2009; David-Chavez and Gavin, 2018), especially
in many mountain (Section 2.3.2.3), Arctic (Section 3.5), and
coastal (Section 4.4.4.4, 4.4.5.4, Cross-Chapter Box 9) areas,
and demonstrate potential for enabling transformational adaptation
(Dodman and Mitlin, 2013; Chung Tiam Fook, 2017). Similarly, the
concepts of scenario planning and ‘adaptation pathway’ design
have expanded since ARS, especially in the context of development
planning for coastal and delta regions (Section 4.4, Cross-Chapter
Box 9; Wise et al, 2014; Maier et al., 2016; Bloemen et al., 2018;
Flynn et al., 2018; Frame et al., 2018; Lawrence et al., 2018).

"AR5 and SR15 have highlighted the importance of evolutionary
adaptation as a component of how populations adapt to climate
change pressures (eg., Portner et al, 2014; Hoegh-Guldberg
et al., 2018). Acclimatisation (variation in morphology, physiology or
behaviour) can result from changes in gene expression but does not
involve change in the underlying DNA sequence. Responses related
to acclimatisation can occur both within single generations and over
several generations. In contrast, evolution requires changes in the
genetic composition of a population over multiple generations; for
example, by differential survival or fecundity of different genotypes
(Sunday et al., 2014). Adaptive evolution is the subset of evolution
attributable to natural selection, and natural selection may lead to
populations becoming more fit (Sunday et al, 2014) or extend the
range of environments where populations persist (van Oppen et al.,
2015). The efficacy of natural selection is affected by population size
(Charlesworth, 2009), standing genetic variation, the ability of a
population to generate novel genetic variation, migration rates and
the frequency of genetic recombination (Rice, 2002). Many studies
have shown evolution of traits within and across life stages of
populations (Pespeni et al., 2013; Hinners et al., 2017), but there are
fewer studies on how evolutionary change can impact ecosystem or
community function, and whether trait evolution is stable (Schaum
and Collins, 2014). Although acclimatisation and evolutionary
adaptation are separate processes, they influence each other, and
both adaptive and maladaptive variation of traits can facilitate
evolution (Schaum and Collins, 2014; Ghalambor et al., 2015).
Natural evolutionary adaptation may be challenged by the speed and
magnitude of current ocean and cryosphere changes, but emerging
studies investigate how human actions may assist evolutionary
adaptation and thereby possibly enhance the resilience of natural

mismatches (Eriksen et al., 2015; Young, 2016; Cosens et al., 2018),
improving the ability for nations to cooperate effectively (Downie

divided policy domains, most notably of climate change adaptation

access private and public sector capabilities requires a polycentric
approach to governance (Ostrom, 2010; Jordan et al. 2015).
Polycentric governance connotes a complex form of governance with
multiple centres of decision making working with some degree of

coasts and cryosphere in a changing climate. It illustrates these through three cases: (Case 1) multi-level interactions in Ocean and
Arctic governance; (Case 2) mountain governance; and (Case 3) coastal risk governance. Governance refers to how political, social,
economic and environmental systems and their interactions are governed or ‘steered’ by establishing and modifying institutional and
organisational arrangements which regulate social processes, mitigate conflicts and realise mutual gains (North, 1990; Pierre and
Peters, 2000; Paavola, 2007). Institutions are formal and informal rules and norms, constructed and held in common by social actors
that guide, constrain and shape human interactions (North, 1990; Ostrom, 2005). Formal institutions include constitutions, laws,
policies and contracts, while informal institutions include customs, social norms and taboos. Both administrative or state government

governance arenas to strengthen responses supporting adaptation in socio-ecological systems (Section 3.5.4). Chapter 4 illustrates
how sea level rise governance attempts to address conflicting interests in coastal development, risk management and adaptation with
a diversity of governance contexts and degrees of community participation, with a focus on equity concerns and inevitable trade-offs
(Section 4.4). Chapter 5 includes a review of existing international legal regimes for addressing ocean warming, acidification and
deoxygenation impacts on social-ecological systems and considers ways to facilitate appropriate responses to ocean change (Sections
5.4, 5.5). Chapter 6 explores the issues of credibility, trust, and reliability in government that arise from promoting ‘paying the costs of
preparedness and prevention’ as an alternative to ‘bearing the costs of loss and damage’ (Section 6.9).

"Climate change challenges existing governance arrangements in a variety of ways. First, there are complex interconnections between
climate change and other processes that influence the ocean, coasts and cryosphere, making it difficult to untangle climate governance
from other governance efforts. Second, the time frames for societal decision-making and government terms are mismatched with
the long-term commitment of climate change. Third, governance choices have to be made in the face of uncertainty about the
rate and scale of change that will occur in the medium to long-term (Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1). Lastly, climate change
progressively alters the environment and hence requires continual innovation and adjustment of governance arrangements (Bisaro
and Hinkel, 2016; Roggero et al., 2018). Novel transboundary interactions and conflicts are emerging as well as new multi-level
governance structures for international and regional cooperation, strengthening shared decision-making among States and other
actors (Case 1). The prospects of ‘disappearing states’, glacier retreat and increasing water scarcity are resulting in States redefining
complex water-sharing agreements (Case 2). Coastal risk is escalating, which may require participatory governance responses and the
co-production of knowledge at the local scale (Case 3; see also Cross-Chapter Box 9).

"Case Study 2 — Mountain Governance: Water management in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan. Gilgit-Baltistan is an arid territory
in a mountainous region of northern Pakistan. Melt water fed streams supply irrigation water for rural livelihoods (NUsser and
Schmidt, 2017). The labour intensive work of constructing and maintaining gravity-fed irrigation canals is done by jirga, traditional
community associations. As glaciers retreat due to climate change, water sources at the edge of glaciers have been impacted, reducing
water available for irrigation. In response, villagers constructed new channels accessing more distant water for irrigation needs
(Parveen et al., 2015). The Aga Khan Development Network supported this substantial task by providing funding and developing a new
kind of cross-scale governance network, drawing on local residents for staff (Walter, 2014), and strengthening community resources,
training and networks. Challenges remain, including the potential for increased rainfall causing landslides that could damage new
canals, and possible expansion of Pakistan’s hydropower infrastructure that would further diminish water resources and displace
villages (Shaikh et al., 2015). On a geopolitical scale, decreased water supplies from the glaciers could exacerbate tensions over water
resources in the region, impacting water management in many parts of the Indus watershed (Uprety and Salman, 2011; Jamir, 2016;
see Section 2.3.1.4 for details).

"Case Study 1 — Multi-level Interactions and Synergies in Governance. The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the
changing Arctic: Climate-change induced sea level rise (Section 4.2), could shift the boundaries and territory of some coastal states,
changing the areas where their coastal rights are applied under UNCLOS. In extreme cases, inundation from sea level rise might
lead to loss of territory and sovereignty, the disappearance of islands and the loss of international maritime jurisdiction subject to
maritime claim. These challenges have limited opportunities for recourse in international law and it remains unclear what adequate
responses from an international law perspective would be (Vidas et al., 2015; Andreone, 2017; Mayer and Crépeau, 2017; Chircop
et al., 2018). While specific legal arrangements and instruments of environmental protection are in place at a regional, sub-regional
and national level, they are insufficient to address the new challenges sea level rise brings. Institutional responses to the geopolitical
transformation caused by climate change, such as through the Arctic Council (AC) and the ‘Law of the Sea’ are still evolving. Similar to
many international agreements, UNCLOS ‘Law of the Sea’ provisions for enforcement, compliance, monitoring and dispute settlement
mechanisms are not comprehensive, and commonly depend on further, detailed law-making by state parties, acting through competent
international organizations (Vidas, 2000; Karim, 2015; De Lucia, 2017; Grip, 2017). Shifts from traditional state-based practices of
international law to multi-level and informal governance structures that involve state and non-state actors (including Indigenous
Peoples) may address these challenges (medium confidence; Cassotta, 2012; Shadian, 2014; Young, 2016; Andreone, 2017). The AC is
a regionally focused governance structure blending new forms of formal and informal multi-level regional cooperation (Young, 2016).
The soft law mechanisms employed draw upon best available practice and standards from multiple knowledge systems (Cassotta and
Mazza, 2015; Pincus and Ali, 2015) in an attempt to respond to the ocean's global, trans-regional and national climate challenges
(Section 3.5.4.2). Reconfiguration and restructuring of the AC has been proposed in order to address emerging trans-regional and global
problems (high confidence; Baker and Yeager, 2015; Pincus and Ali, 2015; Young, 2016). Within the existing scope, the AC has amplified
the voice of Arctic people affected by the impacts of climate change and mobilized action (Koivurova, 2016). The influence of actors
‘beyond the state’ is emerging (Figure CB3.2). However, the state retains its importance in tackling the new challenges produced by
climate change, as the role of international cooperation in UNCLOS and the Polar Regions demonstrates (Section 3.5.4.2). For example,
Article 234 (Ice-covered areas) and Article 197 of the UNCLOS Convention in protecting the marine environment, states that ‘States shall
cooperate on a global basis and, as appropriate, on a regional basis [...] taking into account characteristic regional features’.

sources to observe and interact with their environment, respond to

both mindful of international frameworks on climate change and responsive to national and provincial legislation and policy. A major
challenge that remains is how to navigate the power struggles that will be triggered by this consultative process, as different actors
define and negotiate their interests, roles and responsibilities (see Section 4.4.3; Table 4.9).

scientific knowledge for specific regions and physical processes of
particular concern in a warming climate, including the Greenland and
West Antarctic ice sheets (Section 3.3), and the AMOC (Section 6.7).
Ocean and cryosphere mass changes and sea level studies have
benefited from sustained or newly implemented satellite-based
remote sensing technologies, complemented by in situ data such as
tide gauges measurements (Sections 3.3, 4.2; Dowell et al., 2013;
Raup et al, 2015; PSMSL, 2016). Glacier length measurements in
some locations go back many centuries (Figure 1.3), but it is the
systematic high resolution satellite monitoring of a large number of

assessments of glacier mass loss (Sections 2.2.3, 3.3.2).

These cases illustrate four important points. First, new governance challenges are emerging due to climate change, including: disruptions
to long-established cultures, livelihoods and even territorial sovereignty (Case 1); changes in the accessibility and availability of vital
resources (Case 2); and the blurring of public and private boundaries of risk and responsibility through accelerated coastal erosion
(Case 3; Figure CB3.1). Second, new governance arrangements are emerging to address these challenges, including participatory and
networked structures linking formal and informal networks, and involving state, private sector, indigenous and civil society actors in
different configurations (Figure CB3.2). Third, climate governance is a complex, contested and unfolding process, with governance
actors and networks having to learn from experience, to innovate and develop context-relevant arrangements that can be adjusted
in the face of ongoing change. Lastly, there is no single climate governance panacea for the ocean, coasts and cryosphere. Empirical
evidence on which governance arrangements work well in which context is still limited, but ‘good governance’ norms indicate the
importance of inclusivity, fairness, deliberation, reflexivity, responsiveness, social learning, the co-production of knowledge and
respect for ethnic and cultural diversity.

"Models are numerical approximations of the Earth system that allow
hypotheses about the mechanisms of ocean and cryosphere change
to be tested, support attribution of observed changes to specific
forcings (Section 1.3), and are the best available information for
assessing future change (Figure 1.3). General Circulation Models
(GCMs) typically simulate the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, and land
surface, and sometimes also incorporate terrestrial and marine
ecosystems. Earth System Models (ESM) are climate models that
explicitly include the carbon cycle and may include additional
components (e.g., atmospheric chemistry, ice sheets, dynamic
vegetation, nitrogen cycle, but also urban or crop models). The
systematic set of global-scale model experiments (Taylor et al., 2012)
used in SROCC were produced by CMIP5 (Cross-Chapter Box 1 in

"Palaeoclimate data provide a way to establish the nature of ocean
and cryosphere changes prior to direct measurements (Figure 1.3),
including natural variability and early anthropogenic climate change
(Masson-Delmotte et al., 2013; Abram et al., 2016). Palaeoclimate
records utilise the accumulation of physical, chemical or biological
properties within natural archives that are related to climate at the
time the archive formed. Commonly used palaeoclimate evidence
for ocean and cryosphere change comes from marine and lake
sediments, ice layers and bubbles, tree growth rings, past shorelines
and shallow reef deposits. In many mountain areas, centuries to
millennia of palaeoclimate information is now being lost through
widespread melting of glacier ice (Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 2).
Palaeoclimate data are spatially limited (Figure 1.3), but often
represent regional to global-scale climate patterns, either individually

and cryosphere areas remain difficult to observe systematically,
for example, the ocean under sea ice, subsurface permafrost, high
mountain areas, marginal seas, coastal areas (Section 4.2.2.3)
and ocean boundary currents (Hu and Sprintall, 2016), basin
interconnections (Section 6.6) and the Southern Ocean (Sections
3.2, 5.2.2). Measurements that reflect ecosystem change are often
location or species specific, and assessments of long-term ocean
ecosystem changes are currently only feasible for a limited subset
of variables, for example coral reef health (e.g., coral reef health)
(Section 5.3; Miloslavich et al., 2018). The deep ocean below 2,000 m
is still rarely observed (Talley et al., 2016), limiting (for example) the
accurate estimate of deep ocean heat uptake and, consequently the
full magnitude of Earth’s energy imbalance (e.g., von Schuckmann

level rises and shifts in climate zones and ocean ecosystems during
past warm climate states where temperatures were similar to those
expected later this century (Hansen et al., 2016; Fischer et al., 2018;
Section 4.2.2). Palaeoclimate reconstructions give context to recent
ocean and cryosphere changes that are unusual in the context of
variability over past centuries to millennia, including acceleration in
Greenland and Antarctic Peninsula ice-melt (Section 3.3.1), declining
Arctic sea ice (Section 3.2.1), and emerging evidence for a slowdown
of AMOC (Section 6.7.1). Assessments of climate model performance
across a wider-range of climate states than is possible using direct
observations alone also draws on palaeoclimate data (Flato et al.,
2013), and since AR5 important progress has been made to calibrate
modelled ice sheet processes and future sea level rise based on
palaeoclimate evidence (Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3).

"Models may differ in their spatial resolution, and in the extent
to which processes are explicitly represented or approximated
(parameterised). Model output can be biased due to uncertainties in
their physical equations or parameterisations, specification of initial
conditions, knowledge of external forcing factors, and unaccounted
processes and feedbacks (Hawkins and Sutton, 2009; Deser et al.,
2012; Gupta et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2016). Since ARS there have been
advances in modelling the dynamical processes of the Greenland
and Antarctica ice sheets, leading to better representation of the
range of potential future sea level rise scenarios (Sections 4.2.3).
Downscaling, including the use of regional models, makes it possible
to improve the spatial resolution of model output in order to better
resolve past and future climate change in specific areas, such as high
mountains and coastal seas (e.g., Sections 2.2.2, 3.2.3, 3.5.4, 4.2.2,
6.3.1). For biological processes, such as nutrient levels and organic
matter production, model uncertainty at regional scales is the main
issue limiting confidence in future projections (Sections 5.3, 5.7).
While model projections of range shifts for fishes agree with theory
and observations, at a regional scale there are known deficiencies in
the ways models represent the impacts of ocean variables such as
temperature and productivity (Sections 5.2.3, 5.7).

"Advances have been made over the past decade in developing more
reliable and more highly resolved ocean and atmosphere reanalysis
products. Reanalysis products combine observational data with
numerical models through data assimilation to produce physically
consistent, and spatially complete ocean and climate products
(Balmaseda et al., 2015; Lellouche et al., 2018; Storto et al., 2018;
Zuo et al., 2018). Ocean reanalyses are widely used to understand
changes in physical properties (Section 3.2.1, 5.2), extremes
(Sections 6.3 to 6.6), circulation (Section 6.6, 6.7) and to provide
climate diagnostics (Wunsch et al., 2009; Balmaseda et al., 2013; Hu
and Sprintall, 2016; Carton et al, 2018). Reanalysis products are used
in SROCC for assessing climate change process that cause changes
in the ocean and cryosphere (e.g., Sections 2.2.1, 3.2.1, 3.3.1, 3.4.1,
5.2.2, 6.3.1, 6.6.1, 6.7.1). Improvements in reanalysis products
provide more realistic forcing for regional models, which are used
for assessing regional ocean and cryosphere changes that cannot be
resolved in global-scale models (e.g., Section 2.2.1; Mazloff et al.,
2010; Fenty et al, 2017). The weather forecasts, and seasonal to
decadal predictions building on reanalysis products have important
applications in the early warning systems that reduce risk and aid
human adaptation to extreme events (Sections 6.3.4, 6.4.3, 6.5.3,

"Global environmental assessments increasingly recognise the
importance of IK and LK (Thaman et al., 2013; Beck et al., 2014;
Diaz et al, 2015). References to IK in IPCC assessment reports
increased 60% from AR4 to ARS, and highlighted the exposures and
vulnerabilities of Indigenous populations to climate change risks
related to socioeconomic status, resource-based dependence and
geographic location (Ford et al., 2016a). All four IPBES assessments
in 2018 (IPBES, 2018a; IPBES, 2018b; IPBES, 2018c; IPBES, 2018d)
engaged IK and LK (Diaz et al., 2015; Roué and Molnar, 2017; Diaz
et al., 2018). Peer-reviewed research on IK and LK is burgeoning
(Savo et al., 2016), providing information that can guide responses
and inform policy (Huntington, 2011; Nakashima et al., 2012;
Lavrillier and Gabyshev, 2018). However, most global assessments
still fail to incorporate ‘the plurality and heterogeneity of worldviews’
(Obermeister, 2017), resulting ‘in a partial understanding of core
issues that limits the potential for locally and culturally appropriate
adaptation responses’ (Ford et al., 2016b).

"Education and climate literacy contribute to climate change action
and adaptation (high confidence). Although public understanding
of humanity's role in both causing and abating climate change
has increased in the last decade (Milfont et al., 2017), levels of
climate concern vary greatly globally (Lee et al., 2015). Educational
attainment has the strongest effect on raising climate change
awareness (Lee et al., 2015), and research documents the value of
evidence-based climate change education, particularly during formal
schooling (Motta, 2018). People further understand climate change
as a serious threat when they experience it in their lives and have
knowledge of its human causes (Lee et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2016).
Education and tailored climate communication strategies that are
respectful of people's values and identity can aid acceptance and
implementation of the local to global-scale approaches and policies
required for effective climate change mitigation and adaptation (Shi

This Cross-Chapter Box describes how Indigenous knowledge (IK) and local knowledge (LK) are different and unique sources
of knowledge, which are critical to observing, responding to, and governing the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate (See SROCC
Annex |: Glossary for definitions). International organisations recognise the importance of IK and LK in global assessments, including
UN Environment, UNDP, UNESCO, IPBES, and the World Bank. IK and LK are referenced throughout SROCC, understanding that
many climate change impacts affect, and will require responses from, local communities (both Indigenous and non-Indigenous) who
maintain a close connection with the ocean and/or cryosphere.
"	Text
"Attention to IK and LK in understanding global change is relatively recent, but important (high confidence). For instance, in 1980,
Alaskan Inuit formed the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission in response to the International Whaling Commission's science that
underestimated the Bowhead whale population and, in 1977, banned whaling as a result (Huntington, 1992). The Commission
facilitated an improved population count using a study design based on IK, which indicated a harvestable population (Huntington,
2000). There are various approaches for utilising multiple knowledge systems. For example, the Mi’kmaw Elders’ concept of Two Eyed
Seeing: which is ‘learning to see from one eye with the strengths of Indigenous knowledges, and from the other eye with the strengths
of Western [scientific] knowledges, and to use both together, for the benefit of all’ (Bartlett et al., 2012), to preserve the distinctiveness
of each, while allowing for fuller understandings and actions (Bartlett et al, 2012: 334).

Scientific knowledge, IK and LK can complement one another by engaging both quantitative data and qualitative information,
including people's observations, responses and values (Huntington, 2000; Crate and Fedorov, 2013; Burnham et al., 2016; Figure CB4.1).
However, this process of knowledge co-production is complex (Jasanoff, 2004) and IK and LK possess uncertainties of a different
nature from those of scientific knowledge (Kahneman and Egan, 2011), often resulting in the dominance of scientific knowledge over
IK and LK in policy, governance and management (Mistry and Berardi, 2016). Working across disciplines (interdisciplinarity; Strang,
2009), and/or engaging multiple stakeholders (transdisciplinarity; Klenk and Meehan, 2015; Crate et al., 2017), are approaches used
to bridge knowledge systems. The use of all knowledge relevant to a specific challenge can involve approaches such as: scenario
building across stakeholder groups to capture the multiple ways people perceive their environment and act within it (Klenk and
Meehan, 2015); knowledge co-production to achieve collaborative management efforts (Armitage et al, 2011); and working with
communities to identify shared values and perceptions that enable context-specific adaptation strategies (Grunblatt and Alessa,
2017). Broad stakeholder engagement, including affected communities, Indigenous Peoples, local and regional representatives, policy
makers, managers, interest groups and organisations, has the potential to effectively use all relevant knowledge (Obermeister, 2017)
and produce results that reduce the disproportionate influence that formally educated and economically advantaged groups often
exert in scientific assessments (Castree et al., 2014).

Perspectives from the Himalayas: |K and LK holders in the Himalayas have conducted long-term systematic observations in these remote
areas for centuries. Contemporary IK details change in phenology, weather patterns, and flora and fauna species, which enriches scientific
knowledge of glacial retreat and potential glacial lake outbursts (Sherpa, 2014). The scientific community can close many knowledge gaps
by engaging IK and LK holders as counterparts. Suggestions towards this objective are to work with affected communities to elicit their
knowledge of change, especially IK and LK holders with more specialised knowledge (farmers, herders, mountain guides, etc.), and use
location- and culture-specific approaches to share scientific knowledge and use it with IK and LK.

IK and LK in the Pacific: Historically, Pacific communities, who depend on marine resources for essential protein (Pratchett et al., 2011),
use LK for management systems to determine access to, and closure of, fishing grounds, the latter to respect community deaths, sacred
sites, and customary feasts. Today a hybrid system, Locally Managed Marine Protected Areas (LMMAs), is common and integrates local
governance with NGO or government agency interventions (Jupiter et al., 2014). The expected benefits of these management systems
support climate change adaptation through sustainable resource management (Roberts et al., 2017) and mitigation through improved
carbon storage (Vierros, 2017). The challenges to wider use include both how to upscale LMMAs (Roberts et al., 2017; Vierros, 2017),
and how to assess them as climate change adaptation and mitigation solutions (Rohe et al., 2017; Section 5.4).

"LK to manage flooding: Climate change is increasing glacial melt water and rain-induced disasters in the Himalayan region and
affected communities in China, Nepal, and India use LK to adapt (Nadeem et al., 2012). For instance, rains upstream in Gandaki
(Nepal) flood downstream areas of Bihar, India. Local communities’ knowledge of forecasting floods has evolved over time through
the complexities of caste, class, gender and ecological flux, and is critical to flood forecasting and disaster risk reduction. Local
communities manage risk by using a diverse set of knowledge, including phenomenological (e.g., river sound), ecological (e.g., red ant
movement) and riverine (e.g., river colour) indicators, alongside meteorological and official information (Acharya and Prakash, 2018;

surrounded by ice, andis also one of the most biologically productive regions in the Arctic (Barber et al., 2001). Adjacent Inuit communities
depend on Pikialasorsuaq for their food security and subsistence economy (Hastrup et al., 2018). They use Qaujimajatugangit, an IK
system, in daily and seasonal activities (ICC, 2017). The sea ice bridge north of the Pikialasorsuaq is no longer forming as reliably as
in the past, resulting in a polynya that is geographically and seasonally less defined (Ryan and Miinchow, 2017). In response, the
Inuit Circumpolar Council initiated the Pikialasorsuaq Commission who formed an Inuit-led management authority to (1) oversee
monitoring and research to conserve the polynya’s living resources; (2) identify an Indigenous Protected Area, to include the polynya
and dependent communities; and (3) establish a free travel zone for Inuit across the Pikialasorsuaq region (ICC, 2017; Box 3.2).

"Perspectives from the Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC), Canada: Engaging Inuit as partners across all climate research disciplines
ensures that Inuit knowledge and priorities guide research, monitoring, and the reporting of results in Inuit homeland. Doing so
enhances the effectiveness, impact, and usefulness of global assessments, and ensures that Inuit knowledge is appropriately reported
in assessments. Inuit seek to achieve self-determination in all aspects of research carried out in Inuit homeland (e.g., Nickels et al.,
2005). Inuit actively produce and use climate research (e.g., ITK, 2005; ICC, 2015) and lead approaches to address climate challenges
spurred by great incentive to develop innovative solutions. Engaging Inuit representative organisations and governments as partners
in research recognises that the best available knowledge includes IK, enabling more robust climate research that in turn informs
climate policy. When interpreted and applied properly, IK comes directly from research by Inuit and from an Inuit perspective (ICC,
2018). This can be achieved by working with Inuit on scoping and methodology for assessments and supporting inclusion of Inuit
experts in research, analysis, and results dissemination.

The IPCC assessment process provides instances of how deep uncertainty can manifest. In assessing the scientific evidence for
anthropogenic climate change, and its influence on the Earth system in the past and future, IPCC assessments can identify areas where
a large range of possibilities exist in the scientific literature or where knowledge of the underlying processes and responses is lacking.
Existing guidelines to ensure consistent treatment of uncertainties by IPCC author teams (Mastrandrea et al., 2010; Section 1.9.2) may
not be sufficient to ensure the desired consistency or guide robust findings when conditions of deep uncertainty are present (Adler
and Hirsch Hadorn, 2014).

Characterising, assessing and managing risks to climate change involves dealing with inherent uncertainties. Uncertainties can lead to
complex decision-making situations for managers and policymakers tasked with risk management, particularly where decisions relate
to possibilities assessed as having low or unknown confidence/likelihood, yet would have high impacts if realised. While uncertainty
can be quantitatively or qualitatively assessed (Section 1.9.2; Figure 1.4), a situation of deep uncertainty exists when experts or
stakeholders do not know or cannot agree on: (1) appropriate conceptual models that describe relationships among key driving forces
in a system; (2) the probability distributions used to represent uncertainty about key variables and parameters; and/or, (3) how to
weigh and value desirable alternative outcomes (adapted from Lempert et al., 2003; Marchau et al., 2019b).

"The concept of deep uncertainty has been debated and addressed in the literature for some time, with diverse terminology used.
Terms such as great uncertainty (Hansson and Hirsch Hadorn, 2017), contested uncertain knowledge (Douglas and Wildavsky, 1983),
ambiguity (Ellsberg, 1961) and Knightian uncertainty (Knight, 1921) among others, are also present in the literature to refer to the
multiple components of uncertainty that need to be accounted for in decision making. The purpose of this Cross-Chapter Box is to
constructively engage with the concept of deep uncertainty, by first providing some context for how the IPCC has dealt with deep
uncertainty in the past. This is followed by examples of cases from the ocean and cryosphere assessments in the Special Report on the

Oceans and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC), where deep uncertainty has been addressed to advance assessment of risks
and their management.
"	Text
"Quantitative expressions (likelihood scale) are used when sufficient
data and confidence exists for findings to be assigned a quantitative
or probabilistic estimate (Figure 1.4, step 3). In the scientific literature,
a finding is often said to be significant if it has a likelihood exceeding
95% confidence. Using calibrated IPCC language, this level of
statistical confidence would be termed extremely likely. Lower levels
of likelihood than those derived numerically can be assigned by
expert judgement to take into account structural or measurement
uncertainties within the products or data used to determine the
probabilistic estimates (e.g., Table CB1.1). Likelihood statements
may be used to describe how climate changes relate to the ends of
distribution functions, such as in detection and attribution studies
that assess the likelihood that an observed climate change or event is
different to a reference climate state (Section 1.3). In other situations,
likelihood statements refer to the central region across a distribution
of possibilities. Examples are the estimates of future changes based
on large ensembles of climate model simulations, where the central
66% of estimates across the ensemble (i.e, the 17-83% range)
would be termed a /ikely range (Figure 1.4, step 3).

"The literature has expanded greatly since, allowing successive IPCC assessments to refine the approach taken in the Charney report. By
the IPCC 5th Assessment Report (ARS), four lines of evidence (from instrumental records, palaeoclimate data, model intercomparison
of sensitivity, and model-climatology comparisons) were assessed to determine that ‘Equilibrium climate sensitivity is likely in the
range 1.5°C—4.5°C (high confidence), extremely unlikely less than 1°C (high confidence), and very unlikely greater than 6°C (medium
confidence)’ (Box 12.2 in Collins et al., 2013). The Charney report began the process of convergence of opinion around a single
probability range (essentially, category (2) in the definition of deep uncertainty, above), at least for sensitivity arising from fast
feedbacks captured by global climate models (Hansen et al., 2007). Subsequent assessments increased confidence, eliminating deep
uncertainty about this part of the sensitivity problem over a wide range of probability.

"Case B: Antarctic ice sheet and sea level rise. Dynamical ice loss from Antarctica (Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3) provides an example
of lack of knowledge about processes, and disagreement about appropriate models and probability distributions for representing
uncertainty (categories (1) and (2) in the definition of deep uncertainty). AR5 used a statistical model and expert judgment to reduce
uncertainty compared to AR4 (Church et al., 2013). Based on modelling of marine ice sheet processes after AR5, SROCC has further
reduced uncertainty in the Antarctic contribution to sea level rise. The /ikely range including the potential contribution of marine ice
sheet instability is quantified as 0.02-0.23 m for 2081-2100 (and 0.03-0.28 m for 2100) compared to 1986-2005 under RCP8.5
(medium confidence). However, the magnitude of additional rise beyond 2100, and the probability of greater sea level rise than that
included in the likely range before 2100, are characterised by deep uncertainty (Section 4.2.3).

"The IPCC, and earlier assessments, encountered deep uncertainty when evaluating numerous aspects of the climate change
problem. Examining these cases sheds light on approaches to quantifying and reducing deep uncertainty. An assessment by the
US National Academy of Sciences (Charney et al., 1979; commonly referred to as the Charney Report) provides a classic example.
Evaluating climate sensitivity to a doubling of carbon dioxide concentration, and developing a probability distribution for it, was
challenging because only two 3-D climate models and a handful of model variants and realisations were available. The panel invoked
three strategies to eliminate some of these simulations: (1) Using multiple lines of evidence to complement the limited model
results; (2) estimating the consequences of poor or absent model representations of certain physical processes (particularly cumulus
convection, high-altitude cloud formation, and non-cloud entrainment); and, (3) evaluating mismatches between model results and
observations. This triage yielded ‘probable bounds’ of 2°C-3.5°C on climate sensitivity. The panel then invoked expert judgment
(Box 12.2 in Collins et al., 2013) to broaden the range to 3 + 1.5°C, with 3°C referred to as the ‘most probable value’. The panel did
not report its confidence in these judgments.

Case A: Permafrost carbon and greenhouse gas emissions. AR5 reported the estimated size of the organic carbon pool stored frozen in
permafrost zone soils, but uncertainty estimates were not available (Tarnocai et al., 2009; Ciais et al., 2013). AR5 further reported that
future greenhouse gas emissions (CO2 only) from permafrost were the most uncertain biogeochemical feedback on climate of the ten
factors quantified (Figure 6.20 in Ciais et al, 2013). However, the /ow confidence assigned to permafrost was not due to few studies,
but rather to divergence on the conceptual framework relating changes in permafrost carbon and future greenhouse gas emissions, as
well as the probability distribution of key variables. Most large-scale carbon climate models still lack key landscape-level mechanisms
that are known to abruptly thaw permafrost and expose organic carbon to decomposition, and many do not include mechanisms
needed to differentiate the release of methane versus carbon dioxide with their very different global warming potentials. Studies since
ARS on potential methane release from laboratory soil incubations (Schadel et al., 2016; Knoblauch et al., 2018), actual methane
release from the Siberian shallow Arctic ocean shelves (Shakhova et al., 2013; Thornton et al., 2016), changes in permafrost carbon
stocks from the Last Glacial Maximum until present (Ciais et al., 2011; Lindgren et al., 2018) and potential carbon uptake by future
plant growth (Qian et al., 2010; McGuire et al., 2018) have widened rather than narrowed the uncertainty range (Section 3.4.3.1.1).
Accounting for greenhouse gas release from polar and high mountain (Box 2.2) permafrost, introduces an element of deep uncertainty
when determining emissions pathways consistent with Article 2 of the Paris Agreement (Comyn-Platt et al., 2018). With stakeholder
needs in mind, scientists have been actively engaged in narrowing this uncertainty by using multiple lines of evidence, expert judgment,
and joint evaluation of observations and models. As a result, SROCC has reduced uncertainty and introduced confidence assessments
across some but not all components of this problem (Section 3.4.3.1.1.).

"The three cases validate the continued iterative process required to meaningfully engage with deep uncertainty in situations of risk,
through means such as elicitation, deliberation and application of expert judgement, scenario building and invoking multiple lines
of evidence. These approaches demonstrate feasible ways to address or even reduce deep uncertainty in complex decision situations

(see also Marchau et al., 2019a), considering that possible obstacles and time investment needed to address deep uncertainty, should
not be underestimated.

Using the adapted definition as a framing concept for deep uncertainty (see also Annex 1: Glossary), we find that each of the three
cases described in this Cross-Chapter Box involve at least one of the three ways that deep uncertainty can manifest. In Case A,
incomplete knowledge on relationships and key drivers and feedbacks (category 1), coupled with broadened probability distributions
in post-ARS literature (category 2), are key reasons for deep uncertainty. In Case B, the inability to characterise the probability of
marine ice sheet instability due to a lack of adequate models resulting in divergent views on the probability of ice loss lead to
deep uncertainty (categories 1 and 2). In Case C, the Australian example provides insights on the inadequacy of models or previous
experience for estimating risk of multiple simultaneous extreme events, contributing to the exhaustion of resources which were then
insufficient to meet the need for emergency response. This case also points to the complex task of addressing multiple simultaneous
extreme events, and the multiple ways of valuing preferred outcomes in reducing future losses (category 3).

"Policy makers at various levels of governance are considering adaptation investments (e.g., hard infrastructure, retreat, and nature-based
defences) for multi-decadal time horizons that consider projection uncertainty (Sections 4.4.2, 4.4.3). For example, extreme sea levels
(e.g., the local ‘hundred-year flood’) now occurring during storms that are historically rare are projected to become annual events by
2100 or sooner at many low-lying coastal locations (Section 4.4.3). Sea level rise exceeding the /ikely range, or an alternate pathway
to the assumed climate change scenario (e.g., which RCP is used in risk estimation), could alter these projections and both factors
are characterised by deep uncertainty. Among the strategies used to reduce deep uncertainty in these cases are formal and informal
elicitation of expert judgment to project ice sheet behaviour (Horton et al., 2014; Bamber et al., 2019), and development of plausible
sea level rise scenarios, including extreme cases (Sections 4.2.3, 4.4.5.3). Frameworks for risk management under deep uncertainty in
the context of time lags between commitment to ice sheet losses and emissions mitigation, and between coastal adaptation planning
and implementation, are currently emerging in the literature (Section 4.4.5.3.4).
"	Text
"Case C: Compound risks and cascading impacts. Compound risks and cascading impacts (Section 6.1, 6.8, Figure 1.1, Figure 6.1)
arise from multiple coincident or sequential hazards (Zscheischler et al., 2018). Compound risks are an example of deep uncertainty
because their rarity means that there is often a lack of data or modelling to characterise the risks statistically under present conditions
or future changes (Gallina et al., 2016), and there is the potential that climate elements could cross tipping points (e.g., Cai et al.,
2016). Nevertheless, effective risk reduction strategies can be developed without knowing the statistical likelihoods of such events
by acknowledging the possibility that an event can occur (Dessai et al, 2009). Such strategies are typically well hedged against a
variety of different futures and adjustable through time in response to emerging information (Lempert et al, 2010). Case studies are
useful for raising awareness of the possibility of compound events and provide valuable learnings for decision makers in the form of
analogues (McLeman and Hunter, 2010). They can provide a basis for devising scenarios to stress test systems in other regions for
the purposes of understanding and reducing risk. The case study describing the ocean, climate and weather events in the Australian
state of Tasmania in 2015/2016 (Box 6.1) provides such an example. It led to compound risks that could not have been estimated
due to deep uncertainty. The total cost of the co-occurring fires, floods and marine heat wave to the state government was estimated
at about 300 million USD, and impacts on the food, energy and manufacturing sectors reduced Tasmania's anticipated economic
growth by approximately half (Eslake, 2016). In the aftermath of this event, the government increased funding to relevant agencies
responsible for flood and bushfire management and independent reviews have recommended major policy reforms that are now
under consideration (Blake et al., 2017; Tasmanian Climate Change Office, 2017).

"1.10 Integrated Storyline
of this Special Report
"	Title
"The chapters that follow in this special report are framed around
geographies or climatic processes where the ocean and/or
cryosphere are particularly important for ecosystems and people. The
chapter order follows the movement of water from Earth's shrinking
mountain and polar cryosphere into our rising and warming ocean.
"	Text
"This report does not attempt to assess all aspects of the ocean and
cryosphere in a changing climate. Examples of research themes that
will be covered elsewhere in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Cycle and
not SROCC include: assessments of ocean and cryosphere changes in
the CMIP6 experiments (AR6), cryosphere changes outside of polar
and high mountain regions (e.g., snow cover in temperate and low
altitude settings; AR6), and a thorough assessment of mitigation
options for reducing climate change impacts (SR15, AR6 WGIll).
"	Text
"Each chapter of SROCC presents an integrated storyline on the ocean
and/or cryosphere in a changing climate. The chapter assessments
each present evidence of the pervasive changes that are already
underway in the ocean and cryosphere (Figure 1.5). The impacts that
physical changes in the ocean and cryosphere have had on ecosystems
and people are assessed, along with lessons learned from adaptation
measures that have already been employed to avoid adverse impacts.
The assessments of future change in the ocean and cryosphere
demonstrate the growing and accelerating changes projected for the
future and identify the reduced impacts and risks that choices for
a low greenhouse gas emission future would have compared with a
high emission future (Figure 1.5). Potential adaptation strategies to
reduce future risks to ecosystems and people are assessed, including
identifying where limits to adaptation may be exceeded. The local- to
global-scale responses for charting CRDPs are also assessed.
"	Text
"Chapter 2 assesses High Mountain areas outside of the polar
regions, where glaciers, snow and/or permafrost are common.
Chapter 3 moves to the Polar Regions of the northern and southern
high latitudes, which are characterised by vast stores of frozen water
in ice sheets, glaciers, ice shelves, sea ice and permafrost, and by
the interaction of these cryosphere elements and the polar oceans.
Chapter 4 examines Sea Level Rise and the hazards this brings to
Low-Lying Regions, Coasts and Communities. Chapter 5 focuses
on the Changing Ocean, with a particular focus on how climate
change impacts on the ocean are altering Marine Ecosystems
and affecting Dependent Communities. Chapter 6 is dedicated to
assessing Extremes and Abrupt Events, and reflects the potential
for rapid and possibly irreversible changes in Earth’s ocean and
cryosphere, and the challenges this brings to Managing Risk. The
multitude ways in which Low-Lying Islands and Coasts are exposed
and vulnerable to the impacts of ocean and cryosphere change,
along with resilience and adaptation strategies, opportunities and
governance options specific to these settings, is highlighted in
integrative Cross-Chapter Box 9.

"Ocean ecosystems are threatened globally by three major climate change-induced stressors: warming, loss
of oxygen and acidification. Marine heat waves are occurring everywhere across the surface ocean, and are
becoming more frequent and more intense as the ocean warms. These are causing disease and mass-mortality

"Changes in the ocean and cryosphere occur naturally, but the speed, magnitude, and pervasiveness of the
global changes happening right now have not been observed for millennia or longer. Evidence shows that
the majority of ocean and cryosphere changes observed in the past few decades are the result of human
influences on Earth’s climate.
"	Text
"In high mountains and the Arctic, around 700 million people live in close contact with the cryosphere. These
people, including many Indigenous Peoples, depend on snow, glaciers and sea ice for their livelihoods, food
and water security, travel and transport, and cultures (see FAQ 1.2). They are also exposed to hazards as the
cryosphere changes, including flood outbursts, landslides and coastal erosion. Changes in the polar and high
mountain regions also have far-reaching consequences for people in other parts of the world (see FAQ 3.1).
"	Text
"Warming of the climate system leads to sea level rise. Melt from glaciers and ice sheets is adding to the amount
of water in the ocean, and the heat being absorbed by the ocean is causing it to expand and take up more
space. Today’s sea level is already about 20 cm higher than in 1900. Sea level will continue to rise for centuries
to millennia because the ocean system reacts slowly. Even if global warming were to be halted, it would take
centuries or more to halt ice sheet melt and ocean warming.

"The ocean and cryosphere regulate the climate and weather on Earth, provide food and water, support economies, trade and
transportation, shape cultures and influence our well-being. Many of the recent changes in Earth's ocean and cryosphere are
the result of human activities and have consequences on everyone's life. Deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions will reduce
negative impacts on billions of people and help them adapt to changes in their environment. Improving education and
combining scientific knowledge with Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge helps communities to further address the
challenges ahead.

"Nearly two billion people live near the coast, and around 800 million on land less than 10 m above sea level.
The ocean directly supports the food, economies, cultures and well-being of coastal populations (see FAQ 1.2).
The livelihoods of many more are tied closely to the ocean through food, trade, and transportation. Fish and
shellfish contribute about 17% of the non-grain protein in human diets and shipping transports at least 80% of
international imports and exports. But the ocean also brings hazards to coastal populations and infrastructure,
and particularly to low-lying coasts. These populations are increasingly exposed to tropical cyclones, marine heat
waves, sea level rise, coastal flooding and saltwater incursion into groundwater resources.
"	Text
"Enhanced warming in the Arctic and in high mountains is causing rapid surface melt of glaciers and the
Greenland ice sheet. Thawing of permafrost is destabilising soils, human infrastructure, and Arctic coasts, and
has the potential to release vast quantities of methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere that will further
exacerbate climate change. Widespread loss of sea ice in the Arctic is opening up new routes for shipping, but
at the same time is reducing habitats for key species and affecting the livelihoods of Indigenous cultures. In
Antarctica, glacier and ice sheet loss is occurring particularly quickly in places where ice is in direct contact with
warm ocean water, further contributing to sea level rise.

"Every one of us benefits from the role of the ocean and cryosphere in regulating climate and weather. The ocean
has absorbed about a third of the carbon dioxide humans have emitted from the burning of fossil fuels since the
Industrial Revolution, and the majority (more than 90%) of the extra heat within the Earth system. In this way,
the ocean has slowed the warming humans and ecosystems have experienced on land. The reflective surface of
snow and ice reduce the amount of the sun’s energy that is absorbed on Earth. This effect diminishes as snow and
ice melts, contributing to amplified temperature rise across the Arctic. The ocean and cryosphere also sustain life
giving water resources, by rain and snow that come from the ocean, and by melt water from snow and glaciers
in mountain and polar regions.

"The speed and intensity of the future risks and impacts from ocean and cryosphere change depend critically on
future greenhouse gas emissions. The more these emissions can be curbed, the more the changes in the ocean
and cryosphere can be slowed and limited, reducing future risks and impacts. But humankind is also exposed to
the effects of changes triggered by past emissions, including sea level rise that will continue for centuries to come.
Improving education and using scientific knowledge alongside local knowledge and Indigenous knowledge can

support the development of context-specific options that help communities to adapt to inevitable changes and
respond to challenges ahead.

"Warming of the ocean reduces not only the amount of oxygen it can hold, but also tend to stratify it. As a result,
less oxygen is transported to depth, where it is needed to support ocean life. Dissolved carbon dioxide that has
been taken up by the ocean reacts with water molecules to increase the acidity of seawater. This makes the
water more corrosive for marine organisms that build their shells and structures out of mineral carbonates, such
as corals, shellfish and plankton. These climate-change stressors occur alongside other human-driven impacts,
such as overfishing, excessive nutrient loads (eutrophication), and plastic pollution. If human impacts on the
ocean continue unabated, declines in ocean health and services are projected to cost the global economy
428 billion USD yr"" by 2050, and 1.979 trillion USD yr-! by 2100.

"	Text
"Climate change impacts on the ocean and cryosphere also have many implications for progress on food security
that is addressed in SDG 2 (Zero Hunger). Changes in rainfall patterns caused by ocean warming will increase
aridity in some areas and bring more (or more intense) rainfall to others. In mountain regions, these changes
bring varying challenges for maintaining reliable crops and livestock production. Some adaptation opportunities
might be found in developing strains of crops and livestock better adapted to the future climate conditions, but
this response option is also challenged by the rapid rate of climate change. In the Arctic, very rapidly warming
temperatures, diminishing sea ice, reduced snow cover and degradation of permafrost are restricting the habitats
and migration patterns of important food sources (SDG 2 Zero Hunger), including reindeer and several marine
mammals (SDG 15 Life on Land; SDG 14 Life below Water), resulting in reduced hunting opportunities for staple
foods that many northern Indigenous communities depend upon.

"SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) will be affected by ocean and cryosphere changes. Melting mountain glaciers
bring an initial increase in water, but as glaciers continue to shrink so too will the essential water they provide
to millions of mountain dwellers, downstream communities, and cities. These populations also depend on water
flow from the high mountains for drinking, sanitation, and irrigation, and for SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy).
Water security is also threatened by changes in the magnitude and seasonality of rainfall, driven by rising ocean
temperatures, which increases the risk of severe storms and flooding in some regions, or the risk of more severe
or more frequent droughts in other regions. Among other effects, ongoing sea level rise is allowing salt water to
intrude further inland, contaminating drinking water and irrigation sources for some coastal populations. Actions
to address these threats will likely require new infrastructure to manage rain, melt water, and river flow, in order
to make water supplies more reliable. These actions would also benefit SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) by
reducing the risk of flooding and negative health outcomes posed by extreme rainfall and outbursts of glacial melt.

"Ocean changes are of concern for small island developing states and coastal cities and communities. Beyond possible
reductions in marine food supply and related risks for SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), their lives, livelihoods and well-being
are also threatened in ways that are linked to several SDGs, including SDG 3 (Good Health and Wellbeing), SDG
8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), and SDG 11 (Sustainable
Cities and Communities). For example, sea level rise and warming oceans can cause inundation of coastal homes
and infrastructure, more powerful tropical storms, declines in established economies such as tourism and losses
of cultural heritage and identity. Improved community and coastal infrastructure can help to adapt to these
changes, and more effective and faster disaster responses from health sectors and other emergency services can
assist the populations who experience these impacts. In some situations, the most appropriate responses may
involve relocation of critical services and, in some cases, communities; and for some populations, migration away
from their homeland may become the only viable response.

"	Text
"Without transformative adaptation and mitigation, climate change could undermine progress towards achieving
the 2030 SDGs, and make it more difficult to implement CRDPs in the longer term. Reducing global warming
(mitigation) provides the best possibility to limit the speed and extent of ocean and cryosphere change and give
more options for effective adaptation and sustainable development. Progress on SDG 4 (Quality Education),
SDG 5 (Gender Equality) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) can moderate the vulnerabilities that shape people's
risk to ocean and cryosphere change, while SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 16 (Peace,
Justice and Institutions) and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) will help to facilitate the scales of adaptation
and mitigation responses required to achieve sustainable development. Investment in social and physical
infrastructure that supports adaptation to inevitable ocean and cryosphere changes will enable people to
participate in initiatives to achieve the SDGs. Current and past IPCC efforts have focused on identifying CRDPs.
Such adaptation and mitigation strategies, supported by adequate investments, and understanding the potential
for SDG initiatives to increase the exposure or vulnerability of the activities to climate change hazards, could also
constitute pathways for progress on the SDGs.

"The cryosphere (including, snow, glaciers, permafrost, lake and
river ice) is an integral element of high mountain regions, which
are home to roughly 10% of the global population. Widespread
cryosphere changes affect physical, biological and human systems in
the mountains and surrounding lowlands, with impacts evident even
in the ocean. Building on the IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report (ARS),
this chapter assesses new evidence on observed recent and projected
changes in the mountain cryosphere as well as associated impacts,
risks and adaptation measures related to natural and human systems.
Impacts in response to climate changes independently of changes in
the cryosphere are not assessed in this chapter. Polar mountains are
included in Chapter 3, except those in Alaska and adjacent Yukon,
Iceland and Scandinavia, which are included in this chapter.

"In this report, the following summary terms are used to describe the available evidence: limited, medium, or robust; and for the degree of agreement: low, medium or
high. A level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers: very low, low, medium, high and very high, and typeset in italics, for example, medium confidence. For a given
evidence and agreement statement, different confidence levels can be assigned, but increasing levels of evidence and degrees of agreement are correlated with increasing
confidence (see Section 1.9.2 and Figure 1.4 for more details).

In this report, the following terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or a result: Virtually certain 99-100% probability, Very likely 90-100%,
Likely 66-100%, About as likely as not 33-66%, Unlikely 0-33%, Very unlikely 0-10% and Exceptionally unlikely 0-1%. Additional terms (Extremely likely: 95—-100%,
More likely than not >50-100% and Extremely unlikely 05%) may also be used when appropriate. Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics, for example, very likely (see
Section 1.9.2 and Figure 1.4 for more details). This Report also uses the term ‘likely range’ to indicate that the assessed likelihood of an outcome lies within the 17-83%
probability range.

"Species composition and abundance have markedly changed
in high mountain ecosystems in recent decades (very high
confidence), partly due to changes in the cryosphere (high
confidence). Habitats for establishment by formerly absent species
have opened up or been altered by reduced snow cover (high
confidence), retreating glaciers (very high confidence), and thawing
of permafrost (medium confidence). Reductions in glacier and
snow cover have directly altered the structure of many freshwater
communities (high confidence). Reduced snow cover has negatively
impacted the reproductive fitness of some snow-dependent
plant and animal species, including foraging and predator-prey
relationships of mammals (high confidence). Upslope migration
of individual species, mostly due to warming and to a lesser extent
due to cryosphere-related changes, has often increased local species
richness (very high confidence). Some cold-adapted species, including
endemics, in terrestrial and freshwater communities have declined

"Changes in snow and glaciers have changed the amount and
seasonality of runoff in snow-dominated and glacier-fed river
basins (very high confidence) with local impacts on water
resources and agriculture (medium confidence). Winter runoff
has increased in recent decades due to more precipitation falling as
rain (high confidence). In some glacier-fed rivers, summer and annual
runoff have increased due to intensified glacier melt, but decreased
where glacier melt water has lessened as glacier area shrinks.
Decreases were observed especially in regions dominated by small
glaciers, such as the European Alps (medium confidence). Glacier
retreat and snow cover changes have contributed to localized declines
in agricultural yields in some high mountain regions, including the
Hindu Kush Himalaya and the tropical Andes (medium confidence).
There is limited evidence of impacts on operation and productivity
of hydropower facilities resulting from changes in seasonality and
both increases and decreases in water input, for example, in the
European Alps, Iceland, Western Canada and USA, and the tropical
Andes. {2.3.1}

"Observations show general decline in low-elevation snow
cover (high confidence’), glaciers (very high confidence) and
permafrost (high confidence) due to climate change in recent
decades. Snow cover duration has declined in nearly all regions,
especially at lower elevations, on average by 5 days per decade,
with a likely? range from 0-10 days per decade. Low elevation snow
depth and extent have declined, although year-to-year variation is
high. Mass change of glaciers in all mountain regions (excluding the
Canadian and Russian Arctic, Svalbard, Greenland and Antarctica)
was very likely -490 + 100 kg m~ yr"" (-123 + 24 Gt yr’) in 2006-
2015. Regionally averaged mass budgets were likely most negative
(less than -850 kg m~ yr’) in the southern Andes, Caucasus and the
European Alps/Pyrenees, and least negative in High Mountain Asia
(-150 + 110 kg m~ yr“) but variations within regions are strong.
Between 3.6-5.2 million km? are underlain by permafrost in the
eleven high mountain regions covered in this chapter corresponding
to 27-29% of the global permafrost area (medium confidence).
Sparse and unevenly distributed measurements show an increase
in permafrost temperature (high confidence), for example, by
0.19°C + 0.05°C on average for about 28 locations in the European
Alps, Scandinavia, Canada and Asia during the past decade. Other
observations reveal decreasing permafrost thickness and loss of ice

glacier mass reductions between 2015-2100 are likely 22-44% for
RCP2.6 and 37-57% for RCP8.5. In regions with mostly smaller
glaciers and relatively little ice cover (e.g., European Alps, Pyrenees,
Caucasus, North Asia, Scandinavia, tropical Andes, Mexico, eastern
Africa and Indonesia), glaciers will lose more than 80% of their

many glaciers will disappear regardless emission scenario (very high

ecosystems are expected to continue and impacts to intensify
(very high confidence). While high mountains will provide new
and greater habitat area, including refugia for lowland species,
both range expansion and shrinkage are projected, and at high
elevations this will lead to population declines (high confidence).
The latter increases the risk of local extinctions, in particular for
freshwater cold-adapted species (medium confidence). Without
genetic plasticity and/or behavioural shifts, cryospheric changes will
continue to negatively impact endemic and native species, such as
some coldwater fish (e.g., trout) and species whose traits directly
depend on snow (e.g., snowshoe hares) or many large mammals
(medium confidence). The survival of such species will depend
on appropriate conservation and adaptation measures (medium
confidence). Many projected ecological changes will alter ecosystem
services (high confidence), affecting ecological disturbances (e.g.,
fire, rock fall, slope erosion) with considerable impacts on people

winter snowmelt runoff is projected to increase (high confidence), and
spring peaks to occur earlier (very high confidence). Projected trends
in annual runoff vary substantially among regions, and can even be
opposite in direction, but there is high confidence that in all regions
average annual runoff from glaciers will have reached a peak that
will be followed by declining runoff at the latest by the end of the
21st century. Declining runoff is expected to reduce the productivity
of irrigated agriculture in some regions (medium confidence).
Hydropower operations will increasingly be impacted by altered
amount and seasonality of water supply from snow and glacier melt
(high confidence). The release of heavy metals, particularly mercury,
and other legacy contaminants currently stored in glaciers and

institutional and spatial remoteness. These features are often linked
to physical and social-ecological processes that, although not unique
to mountain regions, typify many of the special aspects of these
regions. Due to their higher elevation compared with the surrounding
landscape, mountains often feature cryosphere components, such as
glaciers, snow cover and permafrost, with a significant influence on
surrounding lowland areas even far from the mountains (Huggel

spring (Auer et al., 2007; Ceppi et al, 2012), while on the Tibetan

elevation dependent warming, ie., that the warming rate is different

"In mountain regions, surface air temperature generally tends to decrease with increasing elevation thus directly impacting how much
of the precipitation falls as snow as opposed to rain. Therefore, changes in air temperature have different consequences for snow
cover, permafrost and glaciers at different elevations. A number of studies have reported that trends in air temperature vary with
elevation, a phenomenon referred to as elevation dependent warming (EDW; Pepin et al., 2015, and references therein), with potential
consequences beyond those of uniform warming. EDW does not imply that warming is larger at higher elevation, and smaller at lower
elevation, but it means that the warming rate (e.g., in °C per decade) is not the same across all elevation bands. Although this concept
has received wide attention in recent years, the manifestation of EDW varies by region, season and temperature indicator (e.g., daily
mean, minimum or maximum temperature), meaning that a uniform pattern does not exist. The identification of the underlying driving
mechanisms for EDW and how they combine is complex.
"	Text
"Several physical processes contribute to EDW, and quantifying their relative contributions has remained largely elusive (Minder et al.,
2018; Palazzi et al., 2019). Some of the processes identified are similar to those explaining the amplified warming in the polar regions
(Chapter 3). For example, the sensitivity of temperature to radiative forcing is increased at low temperatures common in both polar and
mountain environments (Ohmura, 2012). Because the relationship between specific humidity and downwelling radiation is nonlinear,
in a dry and cold atmosphere found at high elevation, any increase in atmospheric humidity due to temperature increase drives
disproportionately large warming (Rangwala et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2014). Snow-albedo feedback plays an important role where the
snow cover is in decline (Pepin and Lundquist, 2008; Scherrer et al., 2012), increasing the absorption of solar radiation which in turn
leads to increased surface air temperature and further snowmelt. Other processes are specific to the mountain environment. Especially
in the tropics, warming can be enhanced at higher elevation by a reduction of the vertical temperature gradient, due to increased
latent heat release above the condensation level, favored in a warmer and moister atmosphere (Held and Soden, 2006). The cooling
effect of aerosols, which also cause solar dimming, is more pronounced at low elevation and reduced at high elevation (Zeng et al.,
2015). While many mechanisms suggest that warming should be enhanced at high elevation, observed and simulated EDW patterns
are usually more complex (Pepin et al., 2015, and references therein). Numerical simulations by global and regional climate models,
which show EDW, need to be considered carefully because of intrinsic limitations due to potentially incomplete understanding and
implementation of relevant physical processes, in addition to coarse grid spacing with respect to mountainous topography (Ménégoz
et al., 2014; Winter et al., 2017).

"Snow on the ground is an essential and widespread component of

the underlying ground, including permafrost, with implications for
ecosystems. Climate change modifies key variables driving the onset

"Assessing the impact of the deposition of short-lived climate forcers
on snow cover changes is an emerging issue (Skiles et al., 2018
and references therein). This concerns light absorbing particles, in
particular, which include deposited aerosols such as black carbon,
organic carbon and mineral dust, or microbial growth (Qian
et al, 2015), although the role of the latter has not been specifically
quantified. Due to their seasonally variable deposition flux and
impact, and mostly episodic nature in case of dust deposition
(Kaspari et al, 2014; Di Mauro et al., 2015), light absorbing particles
contribute to interannual fluctuations of seasonal snowmelt rate
(Painter et al., 2018) (medium evidence, high agreement). There is
limited evidence (medium agreement) that increases in black carbon
deposition from anthropogenic and biomass burning sources have
contributed to snow cover decline in High Mountain Asia (Li et al.,

interannual and decadal variability, similar to its main driving force
solid precipitation (Lafaysse et al., 2014; Mankin and Diffenbaugh,

quantify trends. Long-term in situ records are scarce in some regions
of the world, particularly in High Mountain Asia, Northern Asia and
South America (Rohrer et al., 2013). Satellite remote sensing provides
new capabilities for monitoring mountain snow cover on regional
scales. The satellite record length is often insufficient to assess trends
(Bormann et al., 2018). Evidence of past changes from regional
studies is provided in Table SM2.6. At lower elevation, there is high
confidence that the mountain snow cover has generally declined
in duration (on average by 5 snow cover days per decade, with a
likely range from 0 to 10 days per decade), mean snow depth and
accumulated mass (snow water equivalent) since the middle of the

projections generally do not specifically account for future changes
in the deposition rate of light absorbing particles on snow (or, if
so, simple approaches have been used hitherto; e.g., Deems et al.,
2013), so that future changes in snow conditions are mostly driven
by changes in meteorological drivers assessed in Section 2.2.1.
Evidence from regional studies is provided in Table SM2.7. Although
existing studies in mountain regions do not use homogenous
reference periods and model configurations, common future trends
can be summarised as follows. At lower elevation in many regions
such as the European Alps, Western North America, Himalaya and
subtropical Andes, the snow depth or mass is projected to decline by
25% (likely range between 10 and 40%), between the recent past
period (1986-2005) and the near future (2031-2050), regardless
of the greenhouse gas emission scenario (Cross-Chapter Box 1
in Chapter 1). This corresponds to a continuation of the ongoing
decrease in annual snow cover duration (on average 5 days per
decade, with a likely range from 0 to 10). By the end of the century
(2081-2100), reductions of up to 80% (likely range from 50 to 90%)
are expected under RCP8.5, 50% (likely range from 30 to 70%) under
RCP4.5 and 30% (likely range from 10 to 40%) under RCP2.6. At
higher elevations, projected reductions are smaller (high confidence),
as temperature increases at higher elevations affect the ablation
component of snow mass evolution, rather than both the onset and
accumulation components. The projected increase in winter snow
accumulation may result in a net increase in winter snow mass
(medium confidence). All elevation levels and mountain regions
are projected to exhibit sustained interannual variability of snow
conditions throughout the 21st century (high confidence). Figure 2.3
provides projections of temperature and snow cover in mountain
areas in Europe, High Mountain Asia (Hindu Kush, Karakoram and
Himalaya), North America (Rocky Mountains) and South America
(sub-tropical Central Andes), illustrating how changes vary with
elevation, season, region, future time period and climate scenario.

considerable interannual and regional variations (Medwedeff and Roe,

"Deposition of light absorbing particles, growth of algae and bacteria
and local amplification phenomena such as the enhancement of
particles concentration due to surface snow and ice melt, and
cryoconite holes, have been shown to enhance ice melt (e.g., Ginot

is limited evidence and low agreement that long-term changes in
glacier mass are linked to light absorbing particles (Painter et al.,

there is limited evidence on its role in recent glacier changes (Gardelle

glaciers in Patagonia was attributed to changes in glacier dynamics

"Region averaged glacier mass budgets have been nearly balanced
in the Karakoram since at least the 1970s (Bolch et al., 2017; Zhou
et al, 2017; Azam et al., 2018), while slightly positive balances since
2000 have been reported in the western Kunlun Shan, eastern Pamir,
and the central and northern Karakoram mountains (Gardelle et al.,
2013; Brun et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2017; Berthier and Brun, 2019).
This anomalous behavior has been related to specific mechanisms
countering the effects of atmospheric warming, for example, an
increase in cloudiness (Bashir et al, 2017) and snowfall (Kapnick
et al, 2014) spatially heterogeneous glacier mass balance sensitivity
(Sakai and Fujita, 2017), feedbacks due to intensified lowland
irrigation (de Kok et al., 2018), and changes in summer atmospheric
circulation (Forsythe et al., 2017).
"	Text
"Other factors, such as changes in meteorological variables other
than air temperature or internal glacier dynamics, have modified
the temperature-induced glacier response in some regions (high
confidence). For example, glacier mass loss over the last seven
decades on a glacier in the European Alps was intensified by higher
air moisture leading to increased longwave irradiance and reduced
sublimation (Thibert et al, 2018). Changes in air moisture have also
been found to play a significant role in past glacier mass changes
in eastern Africa (Prinz et al., 2016), while an increase in shortwave
radiation due to reduced cloud cover contributed to an acceleration
in glacier recession in the Caucasus (Toropov et al., 2019). In the
Tien Shan mountains changes in atmospheric circulation in the
North Atlantic and North Pacific in the 1970s resulted in an abrupt
reduction in precipitation and thus snow accumulation, amplifying
temperature-induced glacier mass loss (Duethmann et al., 2015).

"These estimates combined with available regional estimates
(Table 2.A.1) indicate that the glacier mass budget of all mountain
regions (excluding Antarctica, Greenland, the Canadian and
Russian Arctic, and Svalbard) was very likely -490 + 100 kg m@ yr
(-123 + 24 Gt yr) during the period 2006-2015 with most negative
averages (less than -850 kg m~ yr“) in the Southern Andes, Caucasus/
Middle East, European Alps and Pyrenees. High Mountain Asia shows
the least negative mass budget (-150 + 110 kg m yr, Figure 2.4),
but variations within the region are large with most negative regional
balance estimates in Nyaingentanglha, Tibet (-620 + 230 kg m@ yr"")
and slightly positive balances in the Kunlun Mountains for the period
2000-2016 (Brun et al., 2017). Due to large ice extent, the total
mass loss and corresponding contribution to sea level 2006-2015 is
largest in Alaska, followed by the Southern Andes and High Mountain
Asia (Table 2.4.1). Zemp et al. (2019) estimated an increase in mean
global-scale glacier mass loss by ~30% between 1986-2005 and
2006-2015.
"	Text
"Departing from this global trend of glacier recession, a small fraction
of glaciers have gained mass or advanced in some regions mostly
due to internal glacier dynamics or, in some cases, locally restricted
climatic causes. For example, in Alaska 36 marine-terminating
glaciers exhibited a complex pattern of periods of significant retreat
and advance during 1948-2012, highly variable in time and lacking
coherent regional behaviour (McNabb and Hock, 2014). These
fluctuations can be explained by internal retreat-advance cycles
typical of tidewater glaciers that are largely independent of climate
(Brinkerhoff et al., 2017). Irregular and spatially inconsistent glacier
advances, for example, in Alaska, Iceland and Karakoram, have been
associated with surge-type flow instabilities largely independent of
changes in climate (Sevestre and Benn, 2015; Bhambri et al., 2017;
Section 2.3.2). Regional scale glacier mass gain and advances in
Norway in the 1990s and in New Zealand between 1983-2008 have
been linked to local increases in snow precipitation (Andreassen
et al., 2005) and lower air temperatures (Mackintosh et al. 2017),
respectively, caused by changes in atmospheric circulation. Advances
of some glaciers in Alaska, the Andes, Kamchatka and the Caucasus
were attributed to volcanic activity causing flow acceleration through
enhanced melt water at the ice-bed interface (Barr et al., 2018).

"The magnitude and timing of these projected mass losses is assigned medium confidence because the projections have been
carried out using relatively simple models calibrated with limited observations in some regions and diverging initial glacier volumes.
For example, mass loss by iceberg calving and subaqueous melt processes that can be particularly important components of glacier
mass budgets in polar regions (McNabb et al., 2015) have only been included in one global-scale study (Huss and Hock, 2015).

additional models have been presented (Hirabayashi et al., 2013; Huss and Hock, 2015). These six models were driven by climate
projections from 8-21 General Circulation Models (GCMs) from the CMIP5 (Taylor et al., 2012) forced by various RCPs, and results are
systematically compared in Hock et al. (2019).

"Based on these studies there is high confidence that glaciers in polar and high mountain regions will lose substantial mass by the
end of the century. Results indicate global glacier mass losses by 2100 relative to 2015 of 18% (likely range 11-25%) (mean of
all projections with range referring to + one standard deviation) for scenario RCP2.6 and 36% (likely range 26-47%) for RCP8.5,
but relative mass reductions vary greatly between regions (Figure CB6.1). Projected end-of-century mean mass losses relative to
2015 tend to be largest in mountain regions dominated by smaller glaciers and relatively little ice cover, exceeding on average
80%, for example, the European Alps, Pyrenees, Caucasus/Middle East, Low Latitudes and North Asia for RCP8.5 (see Figure 2.1 for
region definitions). While these glaciers’ contribution to sea level is negligible their large relative mass losses have implications for
streamflow (Section 2.3.1, FAQ 2.1).
"	Text
"The projected global-scale relative mass losses 2015-2100 correspond to a sea level contribution of 94 (likely range 69-119) mm sea
level equivalent (SLE) corresponding to an average rate of 1.1 (likely range 0.8-1.4) mm SLE yr for RCP2.6, and 200 (likely range
156 to 240) mm SLE, a rate of 2.4 (likely range 1.8-2.8) mm SLE yr for RCP8.5, in addition to the sea level contribution from the
Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets (Chapter 4). Averages refer to the mean and ranges to + one standard deviation of all simulations.
For RCP2.6, rates increase only slightly until approximately year 2040 with a steady decline thereafter, as glaciers retreat to higher
elevations and reach new equilibrium. In contrast, for RCP8.5, the sea level contribution from glaciers increases steadily for most of
the century, reaching an average maximum rate exceeding 3 mm SLE yr (Hock et al., 2019). For both RCPs the polar regions are the
largest contributors with projected mass reductions by 2100 relative to 2015 combined for the Antarctic periphery, Arctic Canada, the
Greenland periphery, Iceland, Russian Arctic, Scandinavia and Svalbard ranging from 16% (likely range 9 to 23%) for RCP2.6 to 33%
(likely range 22 to 44%) for RCP8.5. Due to extensive ice cover, these regions make up roughly 80% of the global sea level contribution
from glaciers by 2100. The global projections are similar to those reported in AR5 for the period 2081-2100 relative to 1986-2005,
if differences in period length and domain are accounted for (AR5's glacier estimates excluded the Antarctic periphery). The eleven
mountain regions covered in Chapter 2 are likely to lose 22-44% of their glacier mass by 2100 relative to 2015 for RCP2.6 and
37-57% for RCP8.5. Worldwide many glaciers are expected to disappear by 2100 regardless emission scenario, especially in regions

Unlike glaciers and snow, permafrost is a subsurface phenomenon
that cannot easily be observed remotely. As a consequence, its
distribution and change are less understood than for glaciers or
snow, and in many mountain regions it can only be inferred (Gruber

warms at a lower rate than colder permafrost because ground-ice
melt slows warming. Similarly, bedrock warms faster than debris
or soil because of low ice content. For example, several European
bedrock sites (Table 2.1) have warmed rapidly, by up to 1°C per
decade, during the past two decades. By contrast, total warming of
0.5°C—0.8°C has been inferred for the second half of the 20th century
based on thermal gradients at depth in an ensemble of European
bedrock sites (Isaksen et al., 2001; Harris et al, 2003). Warming has
been shown to accelerate at sites in Scandinavia (Isaksen et al.,

was generally greater than for warmer permafrost (high confidence).
SREX found a /ikely warming of permafrost in recent decades and
expressed high confidence that its temperatures will continue to
increase. AR5 found decreases of northern high-latitude near surface
permafrost for 2016-2035 to be very likely and a general retreat of
permafrost extent for the end of the 21st century and beyond to be
virtually certain. While some permafrost phenomena, methods of
observation and scale issues in scenario simulations are specific to
mountainous terrain, the basic mechanisms connecting climate and
permafrost are the same in mountains and polar regions.

"During recent decades, the velocity of rock glaciers in the European
Alps exceeded values of the late 20th century (limited evidence, high
agreement). Some rock glaciers, that is, masses of ice-rich debris
that show evidence of past or present movement, show increasing
velocity as a transient response to warming and water input, although
continued permafrost degradation would eventually inactivate them
(Ikeda and Matsuoka, 2002). Rock glacier velocities observed in the
European Alps in the 1990s were on the order of a few decimetres
per year and during approximately the past 15 years they often
were about 2-10 times higher (Bodin et al., 2009; Lugon and Stoffel,
2010; PERMOS, 2016). Destabilisation, including collapse and rapid
acceleration, has been documented (Delaloye et al., 2010; Buchli
et al., 2013; Bodin et al., 2016). One particularly long time series
shows velocities around 1960 just slightly lower than during recent
years (Hartl et al, 2016). In contrast to nearby glaciers, no clear
change in rock glacier velocity or elevation was detected at a site in
the Andes between 1955-1996 (Bodin et al., 2010). The majority of
similar landforms investigated in the Alaska Brooks Range increased
their velocity since the 1950s, while few others slowed down (Darrow
et al., 2016).

"Because air temperature is the major driver of permafrost change,
permafrost in high mountain regions is expected to undergo
increasing thaw and degradation during the 21st century, with
stronger consequences expected for higher greenhouse gas emission
scenarios (very high confidence). Scenario simulations for the Tibetan
Plateau until 2100 estimate permafrost area to be strongly reduced,
for example by 22-64% for RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 and a spatial
resolution of 0.5° (Lu et al., 2017). Such coarse-scale studies (Guo
et al., 2012; Slater and Lawrence, 2013; Guo and Wang, 2016),
however, are of limited use in quantifying changes and informing
impact studies in steep terrain due to inadequate representation of
topography (Fiddes and Gruber, 2012). Fine-scale simulations, on the
other hand, are local or regional, limited in areal extent and differ
"	Text
"widely in their representation of climate change and permafrost.
They reveal regional and elevational differences of warming and
degradation (Bonnaventure and Lewkowicz, 2011; Hipp et al., 2012;
Farbrot et al, 2013) as well as warming rates that differ between
locations (Marmy et al., 2016) and seasons (Marmy et al., 2013).
While structural differences in simulations preclude a quantitative
summary, these studies agree on increasing warming and thaw
of permafrost for the 21st century and reveal increased loss of
permafrost under stronger atmospheric warming (Chadburn et al.,
2017). Permafrost thaw at depth is slow but can be accelerated by
mountain peaks warming from multiple sides (Noetzli and Gruber,
2009) and deep percolation of water (Hasler et al., 2011). Near Mont
Blanc in the European Alps, narrow peaks below 3,850 m a.s.|. may
lose permafrost entirely under RCP8.5 by the end of the 21st century
(Magnin et al., 2017). As ground-ice from permafrost usually melts
slower than glacier ice, some mountain regions will transition from
having abundant glaciers to having few and small glaciers but large
areas of permafrost that is thawing (Haeberli et al., 2017).

"There is high confidence that air temperature and solar radiation are
the most important drivers to explain observed changes of lake ice
dynamics (Sharma et al., 2019). In mountainous regions where the
interannual variability in ice cover duration is high, additional drivers
become important, for example, morphometry, wind exposure,
salinity, and hydrology, in particular hydrological processes driven by
glaciers (Kropacek et al., 2013; Song et al., 2014; Yao et al., 2016; Gou
et al., 2017). Despite high spatial and temporal variability in lake and
river ice cover dynamics in mountain regions there is limited evidence
(high agreement) that further air temperature increases will result in
a general trend towards later freezing, earlier break-up, and shorter
ice cover duration in the future (Gebre et al., 2014; Du et al., 2017).

of 71 lakes >50 km? including lakes on the Tibetan Plateau during

"The mountain cryosphere is an important source of freshwater in
the mountains themselves and in downstream regions. The runoff
per unit area generated in mountains is on average approximately
twice as high as in lowlands (Viviroli et al., 2011) making mountains
a significant source of fresh water in sustaining ecosystem and
supporting livelihoods in and far beyond the mountain ranges
themselves. The presence of snow, glaciers, and permafrost generally
exert a strong control on the amount, timing and biogeochemical
properties of runoff (FAQ 2.1). Changes to the cryosphere due
to climate change can alter freshwater availability with direct
consequences for human populations and ecosystems.
"	Text
"The cryosphere interacts with the environment and contributes to several climate feedbacks, most notably ones involving
the snow cover, referred to as the snow albedo feedback. The presence or absence of snow on the ground drives profound changes in
the energy budget of land surfaces, hence influencing the physical state of the overlying atmosphere (Armstrong and Brun, 2008).
The reduction of snow on the ground, potentially amplified by aerosol deposition and modulated by interactions with the vegetation,
increases the absorption of incoming solar radiation and leads to atmospheric warming. In mountain regions, this positive feedback
loop mostly operates at the local scale and is seasonally variable, with most visible effects at the beginning and end of the snow
season (Scherrer et al., 2012). Examples of other mechanisms contributing to local feedbacks are introduced in Box 2.1.At the regional
scale, feedbacks associated with deposition of light absorbing particles and enhanced snow albedo feedback were shown to induce
surface air warming (locally up to 2°C) (Ménégoz et al., 2014) with accelerated snow cover reduction (Ji, 2016; Xu et al., 2016), and
may also influence the Asian monsoon system (Yasunari et al., 2015). However, many of these studies have considered so-called
rapid adjustments, without changes in large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns, because they used regional or global models
constrained by large-scale synoptic fields. In summary, regional climate feedbacks involving the high mountain cryosphere, particularly
the snow albedo feedback, have only been detected in large mountain regions such as the Himalaya, using global and regional climate
models (medium confidence).
"	Text
"Global-scale climate feedbacks from the cryosphere remain largely unexplored with respect to the proportion originating from
high mountains. Although mountain topography affects global climate (e.g., Naiman et al., 2017), there is little evidence for
mountain-cryosphere specific feedbacks, largely because of the limited spatial extent of the mountain cryosphere. The most relevant
feedback probably relates to permafrost in mountains, which contain about 28% of the global permafrost area (Section 2.2.4). Organic
carbon stored in permafrost can be decayed following thaw and transferred to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide or methane (Schuur
et al., 2015). This self-reinforcing effect accelerates the pace of climate change and operates in polar (Section 3.4.1.2.3) and mountain
areas alike (Mu et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2018a). In contrast to polar areas, however, there is limited evidence and low agreement on
the total amount of permafrost carbon in mountains because of differences in upscaling and difficulties to distinguish permafrost
and seasonally frozen soils due to the lack of data. For example, on the Tibetan Plateau, the top 3 m of permafrost are estimated to
contain about 15 petagrams (Ding et al., 2016) and mountain soils with permafrost globally are estimated to contain approximately
66 petagrams of organic carbon (Bockheim and Munroe, 2014). At the same time, there is limited evidence and high agreement that
the average density (kg C m2) of permafrost carbon in mountains is lower than in other areas. For example, densities of soil organic
carbon are low in the sub-arctic Ural (Dymov et al., 2015) and 1-2 orders of magnitude lower in subarctic Sweden (Fuchs et al.,
2015) in comparison to lowland permafrost, and 50% lower in mountains than in steppe-tundra in Siberia and Alaska (Zimov et al.,
2006). Some mechanisms of soil carbon decay and transfer to the atmosphere in mountains are similar to those in lowland areas, for
example collapse following thaw in peatlands (Mu et al., 2016; Mamet et al., 2017), and some are specific to areas with steep slopes,
for example drainage of water from thawing permafrost leading to soil aeration (Dymov et al., 2015). There is no global-scale analysis
of the climate feedback from permafrost in mountains. Given that projections indicate increasing thaw and degradation of permafrost
in mountains during the 21st century (very high confidence) (Section 2.2.4), a corresponding increase in greenhouse gas emissions
can be anticipated but is not quantified.

be opposite in sign, there is high confidence that average annual
runoff from glaciers will have reached a peak, with declining runoff
thereafter, at the latest by the end of the 21st century in all regions

peak water in regions with little ice cover and smaller glaciers

glaciers (e.g., Alaska, Southern Andes). In some regions (e.g., Iceland)
peak water from most glacier area is projected to occur earlier for
RCP2.6 than RCP8.5, caused by decreasing glacier runoff as glaciers
find a new equilibrium. In contrast melt-driven glacier runoff
continues to rise for the higher emission scenario. There is very high
confidence that spring peak runoff in many snow-dominated basins
around the world will occur earlier in the year, up to several weeks,
by the end of the century caused by earlier snowmelt (e.g., Coppola

Sultana and Choi, 2018).

"These contrasting trends for summer and annual runoff often result
from spatially variable changes in the contribution of glacier and
snow melt. As glaciers shrink, annual glacier runoff typically first
increases, until a turning point, often called ‘peak water’ is reached,
upon which runoff declines (FAQ 2.1). There is robust evidence and
high agreement that peak water in glacier-fed rivers has already
passed with annual runoff declining especially in mountain regions
with predominantly smaller glaciers, for example, in the tropical
Andes (Frans et al., 2015; Polk et al., 2017), Western Canada (Fleming
and Dahlke, 2014; Brahney et al., 2017) and the Swiss Alps (Huss
and Fischer, 2016). A global modelling study (Huss and Hock, 2018)
suggests that peak water has been reached before 2019 for 82-95%
of the glacier area in the tropical Andes, 40-49% in Western Canada
and USA, and 55-67% in Central Europe (including European Alps
and Pyrenees) and the Caucasus (Figure 2.6).
"	Text
"In addition to changes in ice and snow melt, changes in other
variables such as precipitation and evapotranspiration due to
atmospheric warming or vegetation change affect runoff amounts
and timing (e.g., Bocchiola, 2014; Lutz et al., 2016). Changes in melt
water from ice and snow often dominates the runoff response to
climate change at higher elevations, while changes in precipitation
and evapotranspiration become increasingly important at lower
elevations (Kormann et al., 2015). Permafrost thaw may affect runoff
by releasing water from ground ice (Jones et al., 2018) and indirectly
by changing hydrological pathways or ground water recharge as
permafrost degrades (Lamontagne-Hallé et al., 2018). The relative
importance of runoff from thawing permafrost compared to runoff
from melting glaciers is expected to be greatest in arid areas where
permafrost tends to be more abundant (Gruber et al., 2017). Because
glaciers react more rapidly to climate change than permafrost, runoff
in some mountain landscapes may become increasingly affected by
permafrost thaw in the future (Jones et al., 2018).

"Projections indicate a continued increase in winter runoff in many
snow and/or glacier-fed rivers over the 21st century (high confidence)
regardless of the climate scenario, for example, in North America

(Addor et al., 2014; Bosshard et al., 2014), Scotland (Capell et al.,
2014) and High Mountain Asia (Kriegel et al., 2013) due to increased
winter snowmelt and more precipitation falling as rain in addition to
increases in precipitation in some basins (Table SM2.9). There is robust
evidence (high agreement) that summer runoff will decline over the
21st century in many basins for all emission scenarios, for example,
in Western Canada and USA (Shrestha et al., 2017), the European
Alps (Venicek et al., 2018), High Mountain Asia (Prasch et al., 2013;
Engelhardt et al., 2017) and the tropical Andes (Baraer et al., 2012),
due to less snowfall and decreases in glacier melt after peak water.
A global-scale projection suggests that decline in glacier runoff by
2100 (RCP8.5) may reduce basin runoff by 10% or more in at least
one month of the melt season in several large river basins, especially
in High Mountain Asia during dry seasons, despite glacier cover of

"How does glacier shrinkage affect river runoff further downhill?
"	Title
"Glaciers supply water that supports human communities both close to the glacier and far away from the glacier, for example
for agriculture or drinking water. Rising temperatures cause mountain glaciers to melt and change the water availability. At
first, as the glacier melts, more water runs downhill away from the glacier. However, as the glacier shrinks, the water supply

will diminish and farms, villages and cities might lose a valuable water source.
"	Text
"Furthermore, glacier decline can change the timing in the year and day when the most water is available in
rivers that collect water from glaciers. In mid- or high latitudes, glacier runoff is greatest in the summer, when
the glacier ice continues to melt after the winter snow has disappeared, and greatest during the day when air
temperature and solar radiation are at their highest (FAQ 2.1, Figure 1). As peak water occurs, more intense
glacier melt rates also increase these daily runoff maxima significantly. In tropical areas, such as parts of the
Andes, seasonal air temperature variations are small, and alternating wet and dry seasons are the main control
on the amount and timing of glacier runoff throughout the year.
"	Text
"The effects of glaciers on river runoff further downhill depend on the distance from the glacier. Close to the
glaciers (e.g., within several kilometres), initial increases in yearly glacier runoff until peak water followed by
decreases can affect water supply considerably, and larger peaks in daily runoff from the glaciers can cause
floods. Further away from the glaciers the impact of glacier shrinkage on total river runoff tends to become
small or negligible. However, the melt water from glaciers in the mountains can be an important source of water
in hot and dry years or seasons when river runoff would otherwise be low, and thereby also reducing variability
in total river runoff from year to year, even hundreds of kilometres away from the glaciers. Other components
of the water cycle such as rainfall, evaporation, groundwater and snowmelt can compensate or strengthen the
effects of changes in glacier runoff as the climate changes.
"	Text
"Melting glaciers can affect river runoff, and thus freshwater resources available to human communities, not only
close to the glacier but also far from mountain areas. As glaciers shrink in response to a warmer climate, water
is released from long-term glacial storage. At first, glacier runoff increases because the glacier melts faster and
more water flows downhill from the glacier. However, there will be a turning point after several years or decades,
often called ‘peak water’, after which glacier runoff and hence its contribution to river flow downstream will
decline (FAQ 2.1; Figure 1). Peak water runoff from glaciers can exceed the amount of initial yearly runoff by
50% or more. This excess water can be used in different ways, such as for hydropower or irrigation. After the
turning point, this additional water decreases steadily as the glacier continues to shrink, and eventually stops
when the glacier has disappeared, or retreated to higher elevations where it is still cold enough for the glacier
to survive. As a result, communities downstream lose this valuable additional source of water. Total amounts of
river runoff will then depend mainly on rainfall, snowmelt, ground water and evaporation.

relative amounts of water from different sources — glaciers, snow (outside the glacier), rain and groundwater. Three different time scales are shown: annual
runoff from the entire basin (upper panel); runoff variations over one year (middle panel) and variations during a sunny then a rainy summer day (lower panel).
Note that seasonal and daily runoff variations are different before, during and after peak flow. The glacier’s initial negative annual mass budget becomes more
negative over time until eventually the glacier has melted away. This is a simplified figure so permafrost is not addressed specifically and the exact partitioning
between the different sources of water will vary between river basins.

to the lag time of release from glaciers (Li et al., 2017). Glaciers also
represent the most unstable stores of DDT in European and other
mountain areas flanking large urban centres and glacier derived DDT

(Bogdal et al., 2010). However, bioflocculation (the aggregation of
dispersed organic particles by the action of organisms) can increase
the residence time of these contaminants stored in glaciers thereby
reducing their overall toxicity to freshwater ecosystems (Langford

"Hydropower comprises about 16% of electricity generation globally
but close to 100%, in many mountainous countries (Hamududu

of revenue for mountainous regions (Gaudard et al., 2016). Due
to the dependence on water resources as key input, hydropower
operations are expected to be affected by changes in runoff from
glaciers and snow cover (Section 2.3.1.1, FAQ 2.1). Both increases
and decreases in annual and/or seasonal water input to hydropower
facilities have been recorded in several high mountain regions, for
example, in Switzerland (Hanggi and Weingartner, 2012; Schaefli

that changes in runoff have led to changes in hydropower plant
operation. For example, in Iceland, the National Power Company
observed in 2005 that flows into their energy system were greater
than historical flows. By incorporating the most recent runoff data
into strategies for reservoir management it was possible to increase

"Of the heavy metals, mercury is of particular concern and an estimated
2.5 tonnes has been released by glaciers to downstream ecosystems
across the Tibetan Plateau over the last 40 years (Zhang et al., 2012).
Mercury in glacial silt, originating from grinding of rocks as the
glacier flows over them, can be as large or larger than the mercury
flux from melting ice due to anthropogenic sources deposited on the
glacier (Zdanowicz et al., 2013). Both glacier erosion and atmospheric
deposition contributed to the high rates of total mercury export found
in a glacierised watershed in coastal Alaska (Vermilyea et al., 2017)
and mercury output is predicted to increase in glacierised mountain
catchments (Sun et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2018b) (medium confidence).
However, a key issue is how much of this glacier-derived mercury,
largely in the particulate form, is converted to toxic methyl mercury
downstream. Methyl mercury can be incorporated into aquatic food
webs in glacier streams (Nagorski et al., 2014) and bio-magnify up
the food chain (Lavoie et al., 2013). Water originating from rock
glaciers can also contribute other heavy metals that exceed guideline
values for drinking water quality (Thies et al., 2013). In addition,
permafrost degradation can enhance the release of other trace
elements (e.g., aluminium, manganese and nickel) (Colombo et al.,
2018). Indeed, projections indicate that all scenarios of future climate
change will enhance the mobilisation of metals in metamorphic
mountain catchments (Zaharescu et al., 2016). The release of toxic
contaminants, particularly where glacial melt waters are used for
irrigation and drinking water in the Himalayas and the Andes, is
potentially harmful to human health both now and in the future

"In addition to the effects on agriculture of changing availability of
irrigation water, reductions in snow cover can also impact agriculture
through its direct effects on soil moisture, as reported for Nepal,
where lesser snow cover has led to the drying of soils and lower
yields of potatoes and fodder (Smadja et al., 2015). Agriculture in high
mountain areas is sensitive to other climatic drivers as well. Rising air
temperatures increase crop evapotranspiration, thus increasing water
demand for crop production to maintain optimal yield (Beniston and
Stoffel, 2014). They are also associated with upslope movement of
cropping zones, which favours some farmers in high mountain areas,
who are increasingly able to cultivate new crops, such as onions,
garlic and apples in Nepal (Huntington et al., 2017; Hussain et al.,

hydropower infrastructure when they empty suddenly (Engeset

(Section 2.3.2; Figure 2.7). If large enough, hydropower reservoirs
can reduce the downstream negative impacts of changes in the
cryosphere by storing and providing freshwater during hot, dry
periods or by alleviating the effects of glacier floods (Jackson and
Ragulina, 2014; Colonia et al, 2017). In mountain rivers, sediment

"Adaptation activities in mountain agriculture related at least partially
to cryospheric changes are detailed in Table SM2.12 and their
geographic spread shown in Figure 2.9. Agriculture in these areas
is sensitive to non-climate drivers as well, such as market forces
and political pressures (Montana et al., 2016; Sietz and Feola, 2016;
Figueroa-Armijos and Valdivia, 2017) and shifts in water governance
(Rasmussen, 2016). The majority of the adaptation activities are
autonomous, though some are planned or carried out with support
from national governments, non-governmental organisations (NGOs),
or international aid organisations. Though many studies report on
benefits from these activities which accrue to community members
as increased harvests and income, systematic evaluations of these

Pakistan (Dame and Mankelow, 2010; Clouse, 2016; Niisser and

"To cope with the reduced water supplies, planted areas have been
reduced in a number of different places in Nepal (Gentle and
Maraseni, 2012; Sujakhu et al., 2016). Adaptation responses within
irrigation systems include the adoption of new irrigation technologies
or upgrading existing technologies, adopting water conservation
measures, water rationing, constructing water storage infrastructure,
and change in cropping patterns (Rasul et al., 2019; Figure 2.9). Water
delivery technologies which reduce loss are adopted in Chile (Young

have been adopted in Nepal (Konchar et al. 2015) to reduce
evapotranspiration and frost damage, though limited access to finance
is a barrier to these activities. Box 2.3 describes innovative irrigation
practices in India. Local pastoral communities have responded
to these challenges with techniques broadly similar to those in
agricultural settings by expanding irrigation facilities, for example,
in Switzerland (Fuhrer et al 2014). In addition to adopting new
technologies, some water users make investments to tap more distant
sources of irrigation water. Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1 discusses
such efforts in Northern Pakistan, where landslides, associated with
cryosphere change, have also damaged irrigation systems.

"Lowland agricultural areas which receive irrigation water from rivers

the Rhone basin in Switzerland, many irrigated pasture areas are
projected to face water deficits by 2050, under the A1B scenario
(Fuhrer et al., 2014; Cross Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1). For California
and the southwestern USA, a shift to peak snowmelt earlier in the

existing reservoirs to store water by 2050 under RCP8.5 (Pagan et al.,

at 10.8-48.6 billion USD by around 2050 (Sturm et al., 2017).
A similar transition to runoff peaks earlier in the year by 2100 under
RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, creating challenges for management of
irrigation water, has been reported for the countries in central Asia
which are dependent on snow cover and glaciers of the Tien Shan

"The adoption of new crops and varieties is an adaptation response
found in several regions. Farmers in northwest India have increased
production of lentils and vegetables, which provide important
nutrients to the local diet, with support from government watershed
improvement programs which help address decreased availability
of irrigation water, though stringent requirements for participation
in the programs have limited access by poor households to this
assistance (Dame and Niisser, 2011). Farmers who rely on irrigation
in the Naryn River basin in Kyrgyzstan have shifted from the water
intensive fruits and vegetables to fodder crops such as barley and
alfalfa, which are more profitable. Upstream communities, with
greater access to water and more active local institutions, are more
willing to experiment with new crops than those further downstream
(Hill et al, 2017). In other areas, crop choices also reflect responses
to rising temperatures along with new market opportunities such as
the demand for fresh vegetables by tourists in Nepal (Konchar et al.,
2015; Dangi et al., 2018) and the demand for roses in urban areas in
Peru (SENASA, 2017). Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge
(Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 1), access to local and regional seed
supply networks, proximity to agricultural extension and support
services also facilitate the adoption of new crops (Skarbe and

crop failure risks, and the possibility of growing cash crops. However, the study questioned their usefulness as a long-term adaptation
strategy, because their operation depends on winter runoff and freeze-thaw cycles, both of which are sensitive to interannual
variability, and often deviate from the optimum range required for effective functioning of the reservoirs. It also raised questions
about the financial costs and labour requirements, which vary across the four types of ice reservoirs.

"To cope with seasonal water scarcity at critical times for irrigation, villagers in the region have developed four types of artificial ice
reservoirs: basins, cascades, diversions and a form known locally as ice stupas. All these types of ice reservoirs capture water in the
autumn and winter, allowing it to freeze, and hold it until spring, when it melts and flows down to fields (Clouse et al., 2017; Niisser
et al., 2018). In this way, they retain a previously unused portion of the annual flow and facilitate its use to supplement the decreased
flow in the following spring (Vince, 2009; Shaheen, 2016). Frozen basins are formed from water which is conveyed across a slope
through channels and check dams to shaded surface depressions near the villages. Cascades and diversions direct water to pass over
stone walls, slowing its movement and allowing it to freeze. Ice stupas direct water through pipes into fountains, where it freezes
into conical shapes (Box 2.3 Figure 1). These techniques use local materials and draw on local knowledge (Nlisser and Baghel, 2016).

during the dry season (Soruco et al., 2015), though rising as high as
86% during extreme drought months (Buytaert and De Bievre, 2012).
Despite a 50% area loss, the glacier retreat has not contributed to
reduced water supplies for the city, because increased melt rates
have compensated for reductions in glacier volume. However, for
a complete disappearance of the glaciers, assuming no change in
precipitation, a reduction in annual runoff by 12% and 24% in the
dry season was projected (Soruco et al., 2015) similar to reductions
projected by 2050 under a RCP8.5 scenario for a basin in southern
Peru (Drenkhan et al., 2019). Huaraz and Huancayo in Peru are other
cities with high average contribution of melt water to surface water
resources (up to ~20%; Buytaert et al., 2017) and rapid glacier retreat
in their headwaters (Rabatel et al., 2013).

"Overall, risks to water security and related vulnerabilities are highly
heterogeneous varying even at small spatial scales with populations
closer to the glaciers being more vulnerable, especially during dry
months and droughts (Buytaert et al., 2017; Mark et al. 2017).
A regional-scale modelling study including all of Bolivia, Ecuador and
Peru (Buytaert et al, 2017) estimated that roughly 390,000 domestic
water users, mostly in Peru, rely on a high (>25%) long-term average
contribution from glacier melt, with this number rising to almost
4 million in the driest month of a drought year. Despite high confidence
in declining longer-term melt water contributions from glaciers in the
tropical Andes (Figure CB6.1), major uncertainties remain how these
will affect future human water use. Regional-scale water balance
simulations forced by multi-model climate projections (Buytaert and
De Biévre, 2012), suggest a relatively limited effect of glacier retreat
on water supply in four major cities (Bogota, La Paz, Lima, Quito)
due to the dominance of human factors influencing water supply
(Carey et al., 2014; Mark et al., 2017; Vuille et al., 2018), though
uncertainties are large. Population growth and limited funding for
infrastructure maintenance exacerbate water scarcity, though water
managers have established programs in Quito and in Huancayo and
the Santa and Vilcanota basins (Peru) to improve water management
through innovations in grey infrastructure and ecosystem-based
adaptations (Buytaert and De Biévre, 2012; Buytaert et al., 2017;
Somers et al., 2018).

"A key risk factor that influences how water is managed and
governed, rests on existing and unresolved conflicts that may or
may not necessarily arise exclusively from demands over shared
water resources, raising tensions within and across borders in river
basins influenced by snow and glacier melt (Valdés-Pineda et al.,
2014; Bocchiola et al., 2017). For example, in Central Asia, competing
demand for water for hydropower and irrigation between upstream
and downstream countries has raised tensions (Bernauer and
Siegfried, 2012; Bocchiola et al., 2017). Similarly, competing demand
for water is also reported in Chile (Valdés-Pineda et al., 2014) and in
Peru (Vuille, 2013; Drenkhan et al., 2015). Since AR5, some studies
have examined the impacts and risks related to projections of
cryosphere-related changes in streamflow in transboundary basins
in the 21st century, and suggest that these changes create barriers in
effectively managing water in some settings (medium confidence). For
instance, within the transnational Indus River basin, climate change
impacts may reduce streamflow by the end of this century, thus
putting pressure on established water sharing arrangements between
nations (Jamir, 2016) and subnational administrative units (Yang
et al., 2014b). In this basin, management efforts may be hampered
by current legal and regulatory frameworks for evaluating new dams,
which do not take into account changes in streamflow that may
result from climate change (Raman, 2018). Within the transnational
Syr Darya and Amu Darya basins in Central Asia, competition for
water between multiple uses, exacerbated by reductions in flow
later in this century, may hamper future coordination (Reyer et al.,
2017; Yu et al., 2019). However, other evidence from Central Asia
suggests that relative water scarcity may not be the only factor to
exacerbate conflict in this region (Hummel, 2017). Overall, there is
medium confidence in the ability to meet future water demands in
some mountain regions, given the combined uncertainties associated
with accurate projections of water supply in terms of availability and
the diverse sociocultural and political contexts in which decisions on
water access and distribution are taken.

"Permafrost degradation and thaw as well as increased water flow
into frozen slopes can increase the rate of movement of frozen
debris bodies and lower their surface due to loss of ground ice
(subsidence). Such processes affected engineered structures such
as buildings, hazard protection structures, roads, or rail lines in all
high mountains during recent decades (Section 2.3.4). Movement
of frozen slopes and ground subsidence/heave are strongly related
to ground temperature, ice content, and water input (Wirz et al.,
2016; Kenner et al., 2017). Where massive ground ice gets exposed,
retrogressive thaw erosion develops (Niu et al., 2012). The creep
of rock glaciers (frozen debris tongues that slowly deform under
gravity) is in principle expected to accelerate in response to rising
ground temperatures, until substantial volumetric ice contents have
melted out (Kaab et al., 2007; Arenson et al., 2015a). As documented
for instance for sites in the European Alps and Scandinavia for recent
years to decades, rock glaciers replenished debris flow starting zones
at their fronts, so that the intensified material supply associated
with accelerated movement (Section 2.2.4) contributed to increased
debris flow activity (higher frequency, larger magnitudes) or slope
destabilisation (Stoffel and Graf, 2015; Wirz et al., 2016; Kummert

"There is high confidence that the frequency of rocks detaching and
falling from steep slopes (rock fall) has increased within zones of
degrading permafrost over the past half-century, for instance in
high mountains in North America, New Zealand, and Europe (Allen
et al., 2011; Ravanel and Deline, 2011; Fischer et al., 2012; Coe et al.,
2017). Compared to the SREX and AR5 reports, the confidence in this
finding increased. Available field evidence agrees with theoretical
considerations and calculations that permafrost thaw increases
the likelihood of rock fall (and also rock avalanches, which have
larger volumes compared to rock falls) (Gruber and Haeberli, 2007;
Krautblatter et al., 2013). These conclusions are also supported by
observed ice in the detachment zone of previous events in North
America, Iceland and Europe (Geertsema et al., 2006; Phillips et al.,
2017; Seemundsson et al., 2018). Summer heat waves have in recent
years triggered rock instability with delays of only a few days or
weeks in the European Alps (Allen and Huggel, 2013; Ravanel et al.,
2017). This is in line with theoretical considerations about fast thaw
of ice filled frozen fractures in bedrock (Hasler et al., 2011) and other
climate impacts on rock stability, such as from large temperature
variations (Luethi et al., 2015). Similarly, permafrost thaw increased
the frequency and volumes of landslides from frozen sediments in
many mountain regions in recent decades (Wei et al., 2006; Ravanel
et al., 2010; Lacelle et al., 2015). At lower elevations in the French
Alps, though, climate driven changes such as a reduction in number
of freezing days are projected to lead to a reduction in debris flows

meteorological factors such as loading by snowfall or liquid water
infiltration following, for example, surface melt or rain-on-snow, or
can be triggered by the passage of people in avalanche terrain, the
impact of falling ice or rocks, or by explosives used for avalanche
control (Schweizer et al., 2003). There is no published evidence found
that addresses the links between climate change and accidental
avalanches triggered by recreationists or workers. Changes in snow
cover characteristics are expected to induce changes in spontaneous
avalanche activity including changes in friction and flow regime
(Naaim et al., 2013; Steinkogler et al., 2014).

"Ice break-off and subsequent ice avalanches are natural processes
at steep glacier fronts. How climate driven changes in geometry and
thermal regime of such glaciers influenced ice avalanche hazards over
years to decades depended strongly on local conditions, as shown for
the European Alps (Fischer et al., 2013; Faillettaz et al., 2015). The few
available observations are insufficient to detect trends. Where steep
glaciers are frozen to bedrock, there is, however, medium evidence
and high agreement from observations in the European Alps and
from numerical simulations that failures of large parts of these
glaciers were and will be facilitated in the future due to an increase
in basal ice temperature (Fischer et al., 2013; Faillettaz et al., 2015;

"A rare type of glacier instability with large volumes (in the order of
10-100 million m3) and high mobility (up to 200-300 km/h) results
from the complete collapse of large sections of low-angle valley
glaciers and subsequent combined ice/rock/debris avalanches. The
largest of such glacier collapses have been reported in the Caucasus
Mountains in 2002 (Kolka Glacier, ~130 fatalities) (Huggel et al.,
2005; Evans et al., 2009), and in the Aru Range in Tibet in 2016 (twin
glacier collapses with 9 fatalities) (Kaab et al., 2018). Although there
is no evidence that climate change has played a direct role in the
2002 event, changes in glacier mass balance, water input into the
glaciers, and the frozen regime of the glacier beds were involved in
the 2016 collapses and at least partly linked with climate change
(Gilbert et al., 2018). Besides the 2016 Tibet cases, it is unknown
if such massive and rare collapse-like glacier instabilities can be
attributed to climate change.

"In some regions, glacier surges constitute a recurring hazard, due
to widespread, quasi-periodic and substantial increases in glacier
speed over a period of a few months to years, often accompanied
by glacier advance (Harrison et al., 2015; Sevestre and Benn, 2015).
In a number of cases, mostly in North America and High Mountain
Asia (Bevington and Copland, 2014; Round et al., 2017; Steiner et al.,
2018), surge-related glacier advances dammed rivers, causing major
floods. In rare cases, glacier surges directly inundated agricultural
land and damaged infrastructure (Shangguan et al., 2016). Sevestre
and Benn (2015) suggest that surging operates within a climatic
envelope of temperature and precipitation conditions, and that shifts
in these conditions can modify surge frequencies and magnitudes.
Some glaciers have reduced or stopped surge activity, or are
projected to do so within decades, as a consequence of negative
glacier mass balances (Eisen et al., 2001; Kienholz et al., 2017). For
such cases, related hazards can also be expected to decrease. In

"Arange of slope instability types was found to be connected to glacier
retreat (Allen et al, 2011; Evans and Delaney, 2015). Debris left
behind by retreating glaciers (moraines) slid or collapsed, or formed
fast flowing water-debris mixtures (debris flows) in recent decades,
for instance in the European and New Zealand Alps (Zimmermann
and Haeberli, 1992; Blair, 1994; Curry et al., 2006; Eichel et al., 2018).
Over decades to millennia, or even longer, rock slopes adjacent to or
formerly covered by glaciers, became unstable and in some cases,
eventually collapsed. Related landslide activity increased in recently
deglacierised zones in most high mountains (Korup et al. 2012;
McColl, 2012; Deline et al., 2015; Kos et al. 2016; Serrano et al.,
2018). For example, according to Cloutier et al. (2017) more than
two-thirds of the large landslides that occurred in Northern British
Columbia between 1973-2003, occurred on cirque walls that have
been exposed after glacier retreat from the mid-19th century on.
Ice-rich permafrost environments following glacial retreat enhanced
slope mass movements (Oliva and Ruiz-Fernandez, 2015). At lower
elevations, re-vegetation and rise of tree limit are able to stabilise
shallow slope instabilities (Curry et al., 2006). Overall, there is high
confidence that glacier retreat in general has in most high mountains
destabilised adjacent debris and rock slopes over time scales from
years to millennia, but robust statistics about current trends in this
development are lacking. This finding reconfirms, and for some
processes increases confidence in related findings from the SREX and

documented for individual glaciers in North America and Greenland,

A decrease in moraine-dammed glacier lake outburst floods in recent
decades suggests a response of lake outburst activity being delayed

of events (Veh et al., 2018). For the Himalaya, Veh et al. (2019)161

20 and 30% decrease of natural avalanche activity in the French Alps
for the mid and end of the 21st century, respectively, under A1B
scenario, compared to the reference period 1960-1990. Katsuyama

wet snow are projected to occur more frequently during the winter at
all elevations due to surface melt or rain-on-snow (e.g., Castebrunet
et al., 2014, for the French Alps), and the overall number and runout
distance of snow avalanches is projected to decrease in regions
and elevations experiencing significant reduction in snow cover

agreement that observed changes in avalanches in mountain regions

"Floods originating from the combination of rapidly melting snow and
intense rainfall, referred to as rain-on-snow events, are some of the
most damaging floods in mountain areas (Pomeroy et al., 2016; II
Jeong and Sushama, 2018). The hydrological response of a catchment
to a rain-on-snow event depends on the characteristics of the
precipitation event, but also on turbulent fluxes driven by wind and
humidity, which typically provide most of the melting energy during
such events (Pomeroy et al., 2016), and the state of the snowpack, in
particular the liquid water content (Wiirzer et al., 2016). An increase
in the occurrence of rain-on-snow events in high-elevation zones, and
a decrease at the lowest elevations have been reported (Western USA,
1949-2003, McCabe et al. (2007); Oregon, 1986-2010, Surfleet and

central Europe, 1950-2010, Freudiger et al. (2014)). These trends
are consistent with studies carried out at the scale of the Northern
Hemisphere (Putkonen and Roe, 2003; Ye et al., 2008; Cohen et al.,
2015). There are no studies found on this topic in Africa and South
America. In summary, evidence since AR5 suggests that rain-on-
snow events have increased over the last decades at high elevations,
particularly during transition periods from autumn to winter and
winter to spring (medium confidence). The occurrence of rain-on-
snow events has decreased over the last decade in low-elevation or
low-latitude areas due to a decreasing duration of the snowpack,

"Glacier-related floods, including floods from lake outbursts (GLOFs),
are documented for most glacierised mountain ranges and are among
the most far-reaching glacier hazards. Past events affected areas
tens to hundreds of kilometres downstream (Carrivick and Tweed,
2016). Retreating glaciers produced lakes at their fronts in many high
mountain regions in recent decades (Frey et al., 2010; Gardelle et al.,
2011; Loriaux and Casassa, 2013). Lake systems in High Mountain
Asia also often developed on the surface of downwasting, low-slope
glaciers where they coalesced from temporally variable supraglacial
lakes (Benn et al., 2012; Narama et al., 2017). Corroborating SREX
and ARS findings, there is high confidence that current global glacier
shrinkage caused new lakes to form and existing lakes to grow in
most regions, for instance in South America, High mountain Asia and
Europe (Loriaux and Casassa, 2013; Paul and Mdlg, 2014; Zhang et al.,
2015; Buckel et al., 2018). Exceptions occurred and are expected to
occur in the future for few lakes where evaporation, runoff and
reduced melt water influx in total led to a negative water balance
(Sun et al, 2018a). Also, advancing glaciers temporarily dammed
rivers, lake sections, or fjords (Stearns et al., 2015), for instance
through surging (Round et al., 2017), causing particularly large floods
once the ice dams breached. Outbursts from water bodies in and
under glaciers are able to cause floods similar to those from surface
lakes but little is known about the processes involved and any trends
under climate change. In some cases, the glacier thermal regime
played a role so that climate driven changes in thermal regime are

"Landslides and rock avalanches in glacier environments were often
documented to entrain snow and ice that fluidise, and incorporate
additional loose glacial sediments or water bodies, thereby
multiplying their mobility, volume and reach (Schneider et al., 2011;

glacier advances in recent decades, for instance in North America,
New Zealand and Europe, mainly through reducing surface melt
(Deline, 2009; Reznichenko et al., 2011; Menounos et al., 2013).
In glacier covered frozen rock walls, particularly complex thermal,
mechanical, hydraulic and hydrologic interactions between steep

lead to combined rock/ice instabilities that are difficult to observe
and anticipate (Harris et al., 2009; Fischer et al., 2013; Ravanel et al.,

project future trends. However, from the observed and projected
degradation of permafrost, shrinkage of glaciers and increase in
glacier lakes it is reasonable to assume that event chains involving

has strengthened these findings (Anacona et al., 2015a; Evans and
Delaney, 2015). Some process chains occur frequently, while others
are rare, specific to local circumstances and difficult to anticipate.
Glacier lake outbursts were in many mountain regions and over
recent decades documented to have been triggered by impact waves
from snow-, ice- or rock-avalanches, landslides, iceberg calving
events, or by temporary blockage of surface or subsurface drainage
channels (Benn et al. 2012; Narama et al., 2017). Rock-slope
instability and catastrophic failure along fjords caused tsunamis
(Hermanns et al., 2014; Roberts et al., 2014). For instance, a landslide
generated wave in 2015 at Taan Fjord, Alaska, ran up 193 m on the
opposite slope and then travelled more than 20 km down the fjord
(Higman et al., 2018). Earthquakes have been a starting point for
different types of cascading events, for instance by causing snow-,
ice- or rock-avalanches, and landslides (van der Woerd et al., 2004;
Podolskiy et al., 2010; Cook and Butz, 2013; Saemundsson et al.,
2018). Glaciers and their moraines, including morainic lake dams,
seem however, not particularly prone to earthquake triggered failure
(Kargel et al., 2016).

"Confirming findings from SREX, there is high confidence that the
exposure of people and infrastructure to cryosphere hazards in high
mountain regions has increased over recent decades, and this trend
is expected to continue in the future (Figure 2.7). In some regions,
tourism development has increased exposure, where often weakly
regulated expansion of infrastructure such as roads, trails, and
overnight lodging brought more visitors into remote valleys and
exposed sites (Gardner et al., 2002; Uniyal, 2013). As an example
for the consequences of increased exposure, many of the more
than 350 fatalities resulting from the 2015 earthquake triggered
snow-ice avalanche in Langtang, Nepal, were foreign trekkers and
their local guides (Kargel et al., 2016). Further, several thousand
religious pilgrims were killed during the 2013 Kedarnath glacier
flood disaster (State of Uttarakhand, Northern India) (Kala, 2014).
The expansion of hydropower (Section 2.3.1) is another key factor,
and in the Himalaya alone, up to two-thirds of the current and
planned hydropower projects are located in the path of potential
glacier floods (Schwanghart et al., 2016). Changes in exposure of
local communities, for instance, through emigration driven by climate
change related threats (Grau and Aide, 2007; Gosai and Sulewski,
2014), or increased connectivity and quality of life in urban centres
(Tiwari and Joshi, 2015), are complex and vary regionally. The effects
of changes in exposure on labour migration and relocation of entire
communities are discussed in Section 2.3.7.

"Volcanoes covered by snow and ice often produce substantial
melt water during eruptions. This typically results in floods and/or
lahars (mixtures of melt water and volcanic debris) which can be
exceptionally violent and cause large-scale loss of life and destruction
to infrastructure (Barr et al., 2018). The most devastating example
from recent history occurred in 1985, when the medium-sized
eruption of Nevado del Ruiz volcano, Colombia, produced lahars that
killed more than 23,000 people some 70 km downstream (Pierson
et al., 1990). Hazards associated with ice and snow-clad volcanoes
have been reported mostly from the Cordilleras of the Americas,
but also from the Aleutian arc (USA), Mexico, Kamchatka (Russia),
Japan, New Zealand and Iceland (Seynova et al., 2017). In particular,
under Icelandic glaciers, volcanic activity and eruptions melted large
amounts of ice and caused especially large floods if water accumulated
underneath the glacier (Bjérnsson, 2003; Seneviratne et al., 2012).
There is medium confidence that the overall hazard related to floods
and lahars from ice- and snow-clad volcanoes will gradually diminish
over years-to-decades as glaciers and seasonal snow cover continue
to decrease under climate change (Aguilera et al., 2004; Barr et al.,
2018). On the other hand, shrinkage of glaciers may uncover steep
slopes of unconsolidated volcanic sediments, thus decreasing in the
future the resistance of these volcano flanks to heavy rain fall and
increasing the hazard from related debris flows (Vallance, 2005). In
summary, future changes in snow and ice are expected to modify the
impacts of volcanic activity of snow- and ice-clad volcanoes (high
confidence) although in complex and locally variable ways and at
a variety of time scales (Barr et al., 2018; Swindles et al., 2018).

respond to emergencies, and to ensure the long-term sustainability

"Empirical evidence from past events shows that cryosphere
related landslides and floods can have severe impacts on lives and
livelihoods, often extending far beyond the directly affected region,
and persisting for several years. Glacier lake outburst floods alone
have over the past two centuries directly caused at least 400 deaths
in Europe, 5,745 deaths in South America, and 6,300 deaths in Asia
(Carrivick and Tweed, 2016), although these numbers are heavily
skewed by individual large events occurring in Huaraz and Yungay,
Peru (Carey, 2005) and Kedarnath, India (Allen et al., 2016b).

"Economic losses associated with these events are incurred through
two pathways. The first consists of direct losses due to the disasters,
and the second includes indirect costs from the additional risk and
loss of potential opportunities, or from additional investment that
would be necessary to manage or adapt to the challenges brought
about by the cryosphere changes. Nationwide economic impacts from
glacier floods have been greatest in Nepal and Bhutan (Carrivick and
Tweed, 2016). The disruption of vital transportation corridors that can
impact trading of goods and services (Gupta and Sah, 2008; Khanal
et al., 2015), and the loss of earnings from tourism can represent
significant far-reaching and long-lasting impacts (Nothiger and
Elsasser, 2004; IHCAP, 2017). The Dig Tsho flood in the Khumbu Himal
of Nepal in 1985 damaged a hydropower plant and other properties,
with estimated economic losses of 500 million USD (Shrestha et al.,
2010). Less tangible, but equally important impacts concern the
"	Text
"cultural and social disruption resulting from temporary or permanent
evacuation (Oliver-Smith, 1979). According to the International
Disaster — Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT), over the period
1985-2014, absolute economic losses in mountain regions from all
flood and mass movements (including non-cryosphere origins) were
highest in the Hindu Kush Himalaya region (45 billion USD), followed
by the European Alps (7 billion USD), and the Andes (3 billion USD)
(Staubli et al., 2018). For example, a project to dig a channel in Tsho
Rolpa glacier in Nepal that lowered a glacial lake cost 3 million
USD in 2000 (Bajracharya, 2010), and similar measures have been
taken at Imja Tsho Lake in Nepal in 2016 (Cuellar and McKinney,
2017). Other impacts are related to drinking and irrigation water and
livelihoods (Section 2.3.1). In summary, there is high confidence that
in the context of mountain flood and landslide hazards, exposure, and
vulnerability growing in the coming century, significant risk reduction
and adaptation strategies will be required to avoid increased impacts.
"	Text
"Considering the wide ranging social, economic, and institutional
factors that enable communities to adequately prepare for, respond
to and recover from climate change impacts (Cutter and Morath,
2013), there is limited evidence and high agreement that mountain
communities, particularly within developing countries, are highly
vulnerable to the adverse effects of enhanced cryosphere hazards.
There are few studies that have systematically investigated the
vulnerability of mountain communities to natural hazards (Carey
et al., 2017). Coping capacities to withstand impacts from natural
hazards in mountain communities are constrained due to a number
of reasons. Fundamental weather and climate information is lacking
to support both short-term early warning for imminent disasters, and
long-term adaptation planning (Rohrer et al., 2013; Xenarios et al.,
2018). Communities may be politically and socially marginalised
(Marston, 2008). Incomes are typically lower and opportunities
for livelihood diversification restricted (McDowell et al., 2013).
Emergency responders can have difficulties accessing remote
mountain valleys after disasters strike (Sati and Gahalaut, 2013).
Cultural or social ties to the land can limit freedom of movement
(Oliver-Smith, 1996). Conversely, there is evidence that some
mountain communities exhibit enhanced levels of resilience, drawing
on long-standing experience, and Indigenous knowledge and local
knowledge (Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 1) gained over many
centuries of living with extremes of climate and related disasters
(Gardner and Dekens, 2006). In the absence of sufficient data, few
studies have considered temporal trends in vulnerability (Huggel
et al., 2015a).
"	Text
"There is medium confidence that applying an_ integrative
socioecological risk perspective to flood, avalanche and landslide
hazards in high mountain regions paves the way for adaptation
strategies that can best address the underlying components of
hazard, exposure and vulnerability (Carey et al, 2014; McDowell and
Koppes, 2017; Allen et al., 2018; Vaidya et al., 2019). Some degree
of adaptation action has been identified in a number of countries
with glacier covered mountain ranges, mostly in the form of reactive
responses (rather than formal anticipatory plans) to high mountain
hazards (Xenarios et al., 2018; McDowell et al., 2019) (Figure 2.9).
However, scientific literature reflecting on lessons learned from
adaptation efforts generally remains scarce. Specifically for flood and
landslide hazards, adaptation strategies that were applied include:
hard engineering solutions such as lowering of glacier lake levels,
channel engineering, or slope stabilisation that reduce the hazard
potential; nature-based solutions such as revegetation efforts to
stabilise hazard prone slopes or channels; hazard and risk mapping
as a basis for land zoning and early warning systems that reduce
potential exposure; various community level interventions to develop
disaster response programmes, build local capacities and reduce
vulnerability. For example, there is a long tradition of engineered
responses to reduce glacier flood risk, most notably beginning in the
mid-20th century in Peru (Box 2.4), Italian and Swiss Alps (Haeberli
et al., 2001), and more recently in the Himalaya (Ives et al., 2010).
There is no published evidence that avalanche risk management,
through defence structures design and norms, control measures and
warning systems, has been modified as an adaptation to climate
change, over the past decades. Projected changes in avalanche
character bear potential reductions of the effectiveness of current
approaches for infrastructure design and avalanche risk management
(Ancey and Bain, 2015).

technical capacities, strong local participation and early engagement
in the process, and high-level communication and exchange between
all actors. Particularly for mountain regions, there is high confidence
that integration of knowledge and practices across natural and social
sciences, and the humanities, is most efficient in addressing complex
hazards and risks related to glaciers, snow, and permafrost.

period as an opportunity to build new resilience and adaptive
capacities. Ziegler et al. (2014) exemplify consequences when such
process is rushed or poorly supported by appropriate long-term
planning, as illustrated following the 2013 Kedarnath glacier flood
disaster, where guest houses and even schools were being rebuilt
in the same exposed locations, driven by short-term perspectives. As
changes in the mountain cryosphere, together with socioeconomic,
cultural and political developments are producing conditions beyond
historical precedent, related responses are suggested to include
forward-thinking planning and anticipation of emerging risks and
opportunities (Haeberli et al., 2016).

"The Cordillera Blanca of Peru contains most of the glaciers in the tropics, and its glacier coverage declined significantly in the recent
past (Burns and Nolin, 2014; Mark et al., 2017). Since the 1940s, glacier hazards have killed thousands (Carey, 2005) and remain
threatening. Glacier wastage has also reduced river runoff in most of its basins in recent decades, particularly in the dry season (Baraer
et al., 2012; Vuille et al., 2018). Residents living adjacent to the Cordillera Blanca have long recognised this glacier shrinkage, including
tural populations living near glaciers and urban residents worried about glacier lake floods and glacier landslides (Jurt et al, 2015;
Walter, 2017). Glacier hazards and the glacier runoff variability increase exposure and uncertainty while diminishing adaptive capacity
(Rasmussen, 2016).
"	Text
"Vulnerability to hydrologic variability and declining glacier runoff is also shaped by intertwining human and biophysical drivers playing
out in dynamic hydro-social systems (Bury et al., 2013; Rasmussen 2016; Drenkhan et al., 2015; Carey et al., 2017). Water security is
influenced by both water availability (supply from glaciers) as well as by water distribution, which is affected by factors such as water
laws and policies, global demand for agricultural products grown in the lower Santa River basin, energy demands and hydroelectricity
production, potable water usage, and livelihood transformations over time (Carey et al., 2014; Vuille et al., 2018). In some cases, the
formation of new glacial lakes can create opportunities as well as hazards, such as new tourist attractions and reservoirs of water,
thereby showing how socioeconomic and geophysical forces intersect in complex ways (Colonia et al., 2017).
"	Text
"Cordillera Blanca residents’ risk of glacier-related disasters is amplified by intersecting physical and societal factors. Cryosphere hazards
include expanding or newly forming glacial lakes, slope instability, and other consequences of rising temperatures, and precipitation
changes (Emmer et al., 2016; Colonia et al., 2017; Haeberli et al., 2017). Human vulnerability to these hazards is conditioned by
factors such as poverty, limited political influence and resources, minimal access to education and healthcare, and weak government
institutions (Hegglin and Huggel, 2008; Carey et al., 2012; Lynch, 2012; Carey et al., 2014; Heikkinen, 2017). Early warning systems
have been, or are being, installed at glacial lakes Laguna 513 and Palcacocha to protect populations (Mufoz et al., 2016). Laguna
513 was lowered by 20 m for outburst prevention in the early 1990s but nonetheless caused a destructive flood in 2010, though
much smaller and less destructive than a flood that would have been expected without previous lake mitigation works (Carey et al.,
2012; Schneider et al., 2014). An early warning system was subsequently installed, but some local residents destroyed it in 2017
due to political, social and cultural conflicts (Fraser, 2017). The nearby Lake Palcacocha also threatens populations (Wegner, 2014;
Somos-Valenzuela et al., 2016). The usefulness for ground-level education and communication regarding advanced early warning
systems has been demonstrated in Peru (Mujioz et al., 2016).

"The cryosphere can play a critical role in moderating and driving
how species respond to climate change in high mountains (high

changed abundances and migrated upslope while expanding or
contracting their ranges over the past decades to century, whereas
others show no change (Morueta-Holme et al., 2015; Suding et al.,

in the form of decreasing snow thickness or altered seasonality of
snow (e.g., Matteodo et al., 2016; Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Amagai

for growth, fitness and survival of many species (e.g., Grytnes et al.,

"Widespread climate driven ecological changes have occurred in high
mountain ecosystems over the past century. Those impacts were
assessed in a dedicated manner only in earlier IPCC assessments
(Beniston and Fox, 1996; Gitay et al., 2001; Fischlin et al., 2007) but
not in ARS (Settele et al., 2014). Two of the most evident changes
include range shifts of plants and animals in Central Europe and the
Himalaya but also for other mountain regions (e.g., Morueta-Holme
et al., 2015; Evangelista et al., 2016; Freeman et al., 2018; Liang
et al. 2018; You et al., 2018; He et al., 2019), and increases in
species richness on mountain summits (Khamis et al., 2016; Fell

during recent decades (e.g., Steinbauer et al., 2018), though slowing
over the past ten years in Austria (e.g., Lamprecht et al., 2018).
While many changes in freshwater communities have been directly
attributed to changes in the cryosphere (Jacobsen et al., 2012;
Milner et al., 2017), separating the direct influence of atmospheric
warming from the influence of concomitant cryospheric change
and independent biotic processes has been often challenging for
terrestrial ecosystems (Grytnes et al., 2014; Lesica and Crone, 2016;
Frei et al., 2018; Lamprecht et al., 2018). Changing climate in high
mountains places further stress on biota, which are already impacted
by land use and its change, direct exploitation, and pollutants (Diaz
et al, 2019; Wester et al., 2019). Species are required to shift their
behaviours, including seasonal aspects, and distributional ranges to
track suitable climate conditions (Settele et al., 2014). In the Special
Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR15), climate change scenarios
exceeding mean global warming of 1.5° C relative to preindustrial

"Cryospheric change in high mountains directly harms some plant
species and ecosystems in some regions, degrading a number
of ecosystem services, such as maintaining regional and global
biodiversity, and some provisioning services, for example, fodder
or wood production, in terms of timing and magnitude (high
confidence). In mountains, microrefugia (a local environment
different from surrounding areas) and isolation have contributed
to high plant endemism that increases with elevation (Steinbauer
et al, 2016; Zhang and Zhang, 2017; Muellner-Riehl, 2019).
Microrefugia may enable alpine species to persist if global warming
remains below 2°C relative pre-industrial levels (Scherrer and
Kérner, 2011; Hannah et al., 2014; Graae et al., 2018) (medium
evidence, medium agreement). Yet, where glaciers have been
retreating over recent decades, cool microrefugia have shifted
location or decreased in extent (Gentili et al, 2015). In regions with
insufficient summer precipitation, earlier snowmelt and absence
of permafrost lead to insufficient water supply during the growing
season, and consequently an earlier end of peak season, altered
species composition, and a decline in greenness or productivity
(Trujillo et al., 2012; Sloat et al., 2015; Williams et al., 2015;

plant species and increasing plant productivity (high confidence).
Decreasing snow cover duration, glacier retreat and permafrost
thaw have already and will over coming decades allow plant species,
including some endemic species, to increase their abundance and
extend their range in many mountain ranges (Yang et al., 2010a;
Grytnes et al., 2014; Elsen and Tingley, 2015; Dolezal et al., 2016;
Wang et al., 2016b; D'Amico et al., 2017; Liang et al., 2018; Yang
et al., 2018; You et al., 2018; He et al., 2019). Over recent decades,
plant colonisation after glacier retreat has been swift, for example,
at many sites with favourable soils in the European Alps (Matthews
and Vater, 2015; Fickert and Griininger, 2018) or has even accelerated
compared to 100 years ago (Fickert et al, 2016). At other sites of
the European Alps (D'Amico et al., 2017) and in other mountain
ranges (e.g., Andes and Alaska; Darcy et al., 2018; Zimmer et al.,
2018) the rate of colonisation remains slow due to soil type, soil
formation and phosphorous limitation (Darcy et al., 2018). In Bhutan,
snowlines have ascended and new plant species have established
themselves in these areas, yet despite range expansion and increased
productivity, yak herders describe impacts on the ecosystem services
as mostly negative (Wangchuk and Wangdi, 2018). Earlier snowmelt
often leads to earlier plant growth and, provided there is sufficient
water, including from underlying permafrost, plant productivity has
increased in many alpine regions (e.g., Williams et al., 2015; Yang
et al., 2018). Decreased snow cover duration has led to colonisation
of snowbed communities by wide-ranging species in several regions,
for example, in the Australian Alps (Pickering et al, 2014), though
this can lead to declines in the abundance of resident species, for
example, in the Swiss Alps (Matteodo et al., 2016).

"The shrinking cryosphere represents a loss of critical habitat for
wildlife that depend on snow and ice cover, affecting well-known and

snow and glaciers are essential habitat for birds and mammals
within mountain ecosystems for foraging, relief from climate stress,
food caching and nesting grounds (Hall et al., 2016; Rosvold, 2016)
(robust evidence). Above 5,000 m a.s.|. in Peru, there was recently
a first observation of bird nesting for which its nesting may be
glacier obligate (Hardy et al, 2018). The insulated and thermally
stable region under the snow at the soil-snow interface, termed
the subnivean, has been affected by changing snowpack, limiting
winter activity and decreasing population growth for some mountain
animals, including frogs, rodents and small carnivores (Penczykowski

have moved to new snow free habitat after emerging in spring
from hibernation to dig for forage, which may increase the risk of
human-bear encounters (Berman et al., 2019). In the US Central Rocky
Mountains, migratory herbivores, such as elk, moose and bison, track
newly emergent vegetation that greens soon after snowmelt (Merkle
et al., 2016). For elk, this was found to increase fat gain (Middleton
et al., 2018). Due to loss of snow patches that increase surface water
and thus insect abundance, some mammal species, for example,
reindeer and ibex, have changed their foraging behaviour to evade
the biting insects with negative impacts on reproductive fitness (Vors
and Boyce, 2009; Biintgen et al., 2017).

"Many climate variables influence fisheries, through both direct and
indirect pathways. The key variables linked to cryospheric change
include: changes in air and water temperature, precipitation, nutrient
levels and ice cover (Stenseth et al., 2003). A shrinking cryosphere has
significantly affected cold mountain resident salmonids (e.g., brook
trout, Salvelinus fontinalis), causing further migration upstream in
summer thereby shrinking their range (Hari et al., 2006; Eby et al.,
2014; Young et al., 2018). Within the Yanamarey watershed of the
Cordillera Blanca in Peru, fish stocks have either declined markedly
or have become extinct in many streams, possibly due to seasonal
reductions of fish habitat in the upper watershed resulting from
glacier recession (Bury et al., 2011; Vuille et al., 2018). In contrast,
glacier recession in the mountains of coastal Alaska and to a lesser
extent the Pacific northwest have created a large number of new
stream systems that have been, and could continue to be with
further glacier retreat, colonised from the sea by salmon species
that contribute to both commercial and sport fisheries (Milner et al.,
2017; Schoen et al., 2017) (medium confidence). Changes in water
temperature will vary seasonally, and a potential decreased frequency
of rain-on-snow events in winter compared to rain-on-ground would
increase water temperature, benefiting overwintering survival (Leach

"In the future, increased primary production dominated by diatoms
and golden algae will occur in streams as glacier runoff decreases,
although some cold-tolerant diatom species will be lost, resulting in
a decrease in regional diversity (Fell et al, 2017; Fell et al., 2018).
Reduced glacier runoff is projected to improve water clarity in
many mountain lakes, increasing biotic diversity and the abundance
of bacterial and algal communities and thus primary production
(Peter and Sommaruga, 2016) (limited evidence). Extinction of
range-restricted prey species may increase as more favourable
conditions facilitate the upstream movement of large bodied
invertebrate predators (Khamis et al., 2015) (medium confidence).

notably trout, in mountain streams, (Papadaki et al., 2016; Vigano

which will potentially impact sport fisheries. In northwest North
America, where salmon are important in native subsistence as well
as commercial and sport fisheries, all species will potentially be
affected by reductions in glacial runoff from mountain glaciers over

"The trend to a higher productivity in high mountain ecosystems due to
a warmer environment and cryospheric changes, affects provisioning
and regulating services (high confidence). Due to earlier snowmelt,
the growing season has begun earlier, for example, on the Tibetan
Plateau, and in the Swiss Alps (Wang et al., 2017; Xie et al, 2018),
and in some regions earlier growth has been linked to greater plant
production or greater net ecosystem production, possibly affecting
carbon uptake (Scholz et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2018).
In other areas productivity has decreased, despite a longer growing
season, for example, in the US Rocky Mountains, US Sierra Nevada
Mountains, Swiss Alps, and Tibetan Plateau (Arnold et al., 2014; Sloat

of the vegetation in turn can affect the timing, quantity and quality
of water supply, a critical regulating service ecosystems play in high
mountain areas (Goulden and Bales, 2014; Hubbard et al., 2018)

changed some alpine ecosystems through altered soil temperature
and permeability, decreasing the climate regulating service of a vast

regional species will be lost Jacobsen et al., 2012; Milner et al., 2017)

invertebrates — many of them endemic — as glacier runoff decreases
and transitions to a regime more dominated by snowmelt leading
to a reduction in turnover between and within stream reaches (beta
diversity) and regional (gamma) diversity (very high confidence).
Regional genetic diversity within individual riverine invertebrate
species in mountain headwater areas has decreased with the loss
of environmental heterogeneity (Giersch et al., 2017), as decreasing
glacier runoff reduces the isolation of individuals permitting a greater
degree of genetic intermixing (Finn et al., 2013; Finn et al., 2016;

certain regions as species move upstream, although not in the Andes,

"Conversely, there is also evidence suggesting that some of these
mining activities affect glaciers locally, and the mountain environment
around them, further altering glacier dynamics, glacier structure and
permafrost degradation. This is due mainly to excavation, extraction,
and use of explosives (Brenning, 2008; Brenning and Azocar, 2010;
Kronenberg, 2013), and deposition of dust and other mine waste
material close to or top of glaciers during extraction and transportation
(Brenning, 2008; Torgoev and Omorov, 2014; Arenson et al., 2015b;
Jamieson et al., 2015). These activities have reportedly generated slope
instabilities (Brenning, 2008; Brenning and Azocar, 2010; Torgoev and

dust and debris deposition (Torgoev and Omorov, 2014; Arenson et al.,

kilometres (Jamieson et al., 2015), although their impact is considered
less than that reported for changes in glaciers due to climatic change

similar measures have been introduced in countries such as Chile and
Argentina to address these impacts (Khadim, 2016; Anacona et al.,

(high confidence). For example, in the Western USA, mountain
ecosystems are experiencing an increase in the number and extent
of wildfires, which have been attributed to many factors, including
climate factors such as earlier snowmelt and vapour-pressure deficit
(Settele et al., 2014; Westerling, 2016; Kitzberger et al., 2017; Littell,
2018; Littell et al., 2018). Similarly, landslides and floods in many
areas have been attributed to cryospheric changes (Section 2.3.2).
Disturbances can feedback and diminish many of the ecosystem
services such as provisioning, regulating and cultural services (Millar
and Stephenson, 2015; McDowell and Koppes, 2017; Mcdowell et al.,
2018; Murphy et al., 2018; Maxwell et al., 2019). Consistent with AR5
findings (Settele et al., 2014) the capacity of many freshwater and
terrestrial mountain species to adapt naturally to climate change is
projected to be exceeded for high warming levels, leading to species
migration across mountain ranges or loss with consequences for
many ecosystem services (Elsen and Tingley, 2015; Dobrowski and
Parks, 2016; Pecl et al., 2017; Rumpf et al., 2019) (robust evidence,
medium agreement, i.e., high confidence). Although the adaptive
potential of aquatic biota to projected changes in glacial runoff is not
fully understood (Lencioni et al., 2015), dispersion and phenotypic
plasticity together with additional microrefugia formation due to
cryospheric changes, is expected to help threatened species to better
adapt, perhaps even in the long term (Shama and Robinson, 2009).
Likewise, traits shaped by climate and with high genetically-based
standing variation may be used to spatially identify, map and manage
global ‘hotspots’ for evolutionary rescue from climate change (Jones
et al., 2018; Mills et al., 2018). Nature conservation increases the
potential for mitigating adverse effects on many of these ecosystem
services, including those that are essential for the support of the
livelihoods and the culture of mountain peoples, including economical

The Alps in Europe support the largest ski industry (Vanat, 2018). In
Europe, the growth of alpine skiing and winter tourism after 1930
brought major economic growth to alpine regions and transformed
winter sports into a multi-billion USD industry (Denning, 2014).
Sixteen percent of skier visits occur in the USA, where expenditures
from all recreational snow sports generated more than 695,000
jobs and 72.7 billion USD in trip-related spending in 2016 (Outdoor

USA has been decreasing since the 1980s, China added 57 new ski
resorts in 2017 (Vanat, 2018). Although the bulk of economic activity
is held within mountain communities, supply chains for production
of ski equipment and apparel span the globe. Steiger et al. (2017)

"The projected economic losses reported in the literature include
an annual loss in hotel revenues of EUR 560 million (2012 value)
in Europe, compared to the period 1971-2000 under a 2°C global
warming scenario (Damm et al., 2017). This estimate includes
population projections but does not account for snow management.
In the USA, Wobus et al. (2017) estimate annual revenue losses from
tickets (skiing) and day fees (cross country skiing and snowmobiling)
due to reduced snow season length, will range from 340-780 million
USD in 2050 for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively, and from 130 million
to 2 billion USD in 2090 for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 respectively, taking
into account snow management and population projections. Total
economic losses from these studies would be much higher if all
costs were included (costs for tickets, transport, lodging, food and
equipment). Regardless of the climate scenario, as risk of financial
unviability increases, there are reported expectations that companies
would need to forecast when their assets may become stranded
assets and require devaluation or conversion to liabilities, and
report this on their balance sheets (Caldecott et al., 2016). Economic
impacts are projected to occur in other snow-based winter activities
including events (e.g., ski races) and other recreation activities
such as cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, backcountry skiing, ice
climbing, sledding, snowmobiling and snow tubing. By 2050, 13 (out
of 21) prior Olympic Winter Games locations are projected to exhibit
adequate snow reliability under RCP2.6, and 10 under RCP8.5. By
2080, the number decreases to 12 and 8, respectively (Scott et al.,

"make it particularly vulnerable to climate change (Arent et al., 2014;
Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018). Snow reliability, although not universally
defined, quantifies whether the snow cover is sufficient for ski resorts
operations. Depending on the context, it focuses on specific periods
of the winter season, and may account for interannual variability
and/or for snow management (Steiger et al., 2017). The effects of
less snow, due to strong correlation between snow cover and skier
visits, cost the USA economy 1 billion USD and 17,400 jobs per year
between 2001-2016 in years of less seasonal snow (Hagenstad et al.,
2018). Efforts to reduce climate change impacts and risks to economic
losses focus on increased snowmaking, such as artificial production
of snow (Steiger et al, 2017), summertime slope preparation (Pintaldi
et al., 2017), grooming (Steiger et al., 2017), and snow farming, that
is, storage of snow (Griinewald et al., 2018). The effectiveness of
snow management methods as adaptation to long-term climate
change depends on sufficiently low air temperature conditions
needed for snowmaking, water and energy availability, compliance
with environmental regulations (de Jong, 2015), and ability to pay
for investment and operating costs. When these requirements are
met, evidence over the past decades shows that snow management
methods have generally proven efficient in reducing the impact of
reduced natural snow cover duration for many resorts (Dawson and
Scott, 2013; Hopkins and Maclean, 2014; Steiger et al., 2017; Spandre
et al., 2019a). The number of skier visits was found to be 39% less
sensitive to natural snow variations in Swiss ski resorts with 30%
areal snowmaking coverage (representing the national average),
compared to resorts without snowmaking (Gonseth, 2013). In some
regions, many resorts (mostly smaller, low-elevation resorts) have
closed due to unfavourable snow conditions brought on by climate
change and/or the associated need for large capital investments for
snowmaking capacities (e.g., in northeast USA; Beaudin and Huang,
2014). To offset loss in ski tourism revenue, a key adaptation strategy
is diversification, offering other non-snow recreation options such
as mountain biking, mountain coasters and alpine slides, indoor
climbing walls and water parks, festivals and other special events

respect to sacred beings or to follow proper conduct. Experiencing
deep concern that they have disturbed cosmic order, they seek to
behave in closer accord with established traditions; they anticipate
that the retreat will continue, leading to further environmental
degradation and to the decline of natural and social orders — a
prospect which causes them distress (Becken et al., 2013; Gagné
et al., 2014; Allison, 2015). In the USA, the snow covered peaks of the
Cascades have also evoked a deep sense of awe and majesty, and
an obligation to protect them (Carroll, 2012; Duntley, 2015). Similar
views are found in the Italian Alps, where villagers speak of treating
glacier peaks with “respect,” and state that glacier retreat is due,
at least in part, to humans “disturbing” the glaciers (Brugger et al.,
2013), resulting in an emotion which Albrecht et al. (2007) termed
solastalgia, a kind of deep environmental distress or ecological grief
(Cunsolo and Ellis, 2018).

extensively in AR5, with particular emphasis on small island states

Heritage natural sites recognised for their outstanding universal

presence of glaciers is stated among the principal reason (5 sites), or
secondary reason (28 sites), for World Heritage inscription; complete
glacier extinction is projected by 2100 in 8 to 21 of these sites,
under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively, compromising the
outstanding universal value placed on these sites, which have been
inscribed at least partly for their exceptional glaciers (Bosson et al.,
2019). UNESCO defines “outstanding universal value” as “cultural
and/or natural significance which is so exceptional as to transcend
national boundaries and to be of common importance for present and
future generations of all humanity” (UNESCO, 2012). Furthermore, in
recognising the importance of the cultural and intangible value placed
by communities on aspects of their surrounding environment, such as
those afforded by cryosphere elements in the high mountains, cultural
values are mentioned under the workplan of the Warsaw International

mountain areas have influenced human mobility and migration
during this century by altering water availability and increasing
exposure to mass movements and floods and other cryospheric
induced disasters (Figure 2.7) (Barnett et al., 2005; Carey et al., 2017;

"wage labour migration to provide supplementary income in a number
of regions (medium evidence, high agreement). Wage labour
migration linked to cryosphere changes occurs on several time scales,
including short-term, long-term and permanent migration, and on
different spatial scales. Though migration usually takes place within
the country of origin, and sometimes within the region, cases of
international migration have also been recorded (Merrey et al., 2018).
The studies since ARS on migration driven by cryosphere changes
are concentrated in High Mountain Asia and the Andes, supporting
the finding, reported in ARS Working Group II (Section 12.7), that
stress on livelihoods is an important driver of climate change induced
migration. The research on such migration also supports the finding
in $R15 (Section 4.3.5.6) that migration can have mixed outcomes
on reducing socioeconomic vulnerability, since cases of increase and
of reduction of vulnerability are both found in migration from high
mountain regions that is driven by cryosphere changes.

"Transhumant pastoralism, involving movements between summer
and winter pastures, is a centuries old practice in high mountain
areas (Lozny, 2013). In High Mountain Asia and other regions, it is
declining due to both climatic factors, including changes in snow
distribution and glaciers, and to non-climatic factors, and is projected
to continue declining, at least in the short term (medium evidence,
high agreement). The changes in snow and glaciers adversely affect
herders at their summer residences and winter camps in the Himalaya
(Namgay et al., 2014) and in Scandinavian mountains (Mallory and
Boyce, 2018). Reduced winter snowfall has led to poorer pasture
quality in Nepal (Gentle and Maraseni, 2012) and India (Ingty, 2017).
Other climate change impacts, including erratic snowfall patterns
and a decrease in rainfall, are perceived by herders in Afghanistan,
Nepal and Pakistan to have resulted in vegetation of lower quality
and quantity (Shaoliang et al., 2012; Joshi et al., 2013; Gentle and
Thwaites, 2016). Heavy snowfall incidents in winter caused deaths of
a large number of livestock in northern Pakistan in 2009 (Shaoliang
et al., 2012). Herders in Nepal reported of water scarcity in traditional
water sources along migration routes (Gentle and Thwaites, 2016).
Increased glacier melt water has caused lakes on the Tibetan Plateau
to increase in size, covering pasture areas and leading pastoralists
to alter their patterns of seasonal movement (Nyima and Hopping,
2019). However, rising temperatures, with associated effects on snow
cover, have some positive impacts. Seasonal migration from winter
to summer pastures start earlier in Northern Pakistan, and residence
in summer pasture lasts longer (Joshi et al., 2013), as it does in
Afghanistan (Shaoliang et al., 2012).

"Changing water availability, mass movements and floods are
cryosphere processes which drive wage labour migration (medium
evidence, high agreement). A debris flow in central Nepal in 2014, in
a region where landslides have increased in recent decades, led more
than half the households to migrate for months (van der Geest and
Schindler, 2016). In the Santa River drainage, Peru, rural populations
have declined 10% between 1970-2000, and the area of several
major subsistence crops also declined (Bury et al., 2013). Research in
this region suggests that seasonal wage labour migration from small
basins within the main Santa basin is largest in the small drainages in
which glacier retreat has reduced melt water flow most significantly;
where this process is not as acute, and streamflow is less reduced,
migration rates are lower (Wrathall et al., 2014). A study from a
region in the central Peruvian Andes shows that the residents of the
villages that have the highest dependence on glacier melt water travel
further and stay away longer than the residents of the villages where
glacier melt water forms a smaller portion of stream flow (Milan
and Ho, 2014). However, the inverse relation between reliance on
cryosphere-related water sources and migration was noted in a case
in the Naryn River drainage in Kyrgyzstan, where the villages that are
more dependent on glacier melt water had lower, rather than higher,
rates of wage labour migration than the villages which were less
dependent on it; the villages with lower rates of such migration also
had more efficient water management institutions than the others
(Hill et al, 2017). Several studies, which project cryosphere-related
emigration to continue in the short term, emphasise decreased
water availability, due to glacier retreat as a driver in Kyrgyzstan
(Chandonnet et al., 2016) and Peru (Oliver-Smith, 2014), and to
reduced snow cover in Nepal (Prasain, 2018). In most cases, climate
is only one of several drivers (employment opportunities and better
educational and health services in lowland areas are others).

natural hazards are responsible for resettlement of villages in certain
high mountain areas (McDonald, 1989; Parveen et al., 2015). A village
in Western Nepal moved to lower elevation after decreasing snowfall
reduced the flow of water in the river on which their pastoralism and
agriculture depended (Barnett et al., 2005). Three villages in Nepal
faced severe declines in agricultural and pastoral livelihoods because
decreased snow cover led to reduced soil moisture and to the drying
up of springs, which were the historical source of irrigation water;
in conjunction with an international non-governmental organisation

"The issue of habitability arises in the cases, mentioned above, of
communities that relocate after floods or debris flows destroy houses
and irrigation infrastructure, or damage fields and pastures. It occurs
as well in the cases of households with extensive long-term migration,
where agricultural and pastoral livelihoods are undermined by
reduced water supply caused by cryospheric change (Barnett et al.,
2005). In addition, the loss of cultural values, including spiritual
and intrinsic values (Section 2.3.6), can contribute to decisions to
migrate (Kaenzig, 2015). Combined with the patterns of permanent
emigration, this issue of habitability raises the issue of limits to
adaptation in mountain areas (Huggel et al., 2019). Projections of
decreased streamflow by 2100 in watersheds with strong glacier melt
water components in Asia, Europe, and North and South America
(Section 2.3.1.1) indicate that threats to habitability may continue
through this period and affect the endeavours of achieving the SDGs
in developing countries (Rasul et al., 2019).

"Recent research on cryosphere driven migration shows some
cases of complex livelihood interactions or feedback loops, in
which migration is not merely a result of changes in agricultural
livelihoods, but also has impacts, either positive or negative, on these
livelihoods (medium confidence). In some instances, the different
livelihood strategies complement each other to support income and
well-being. A review of migration in the Himalaya and Hindu Kush
found that households that participated in labour migration and
received remittances had improved adaptive capacity, and lowered
exposure to natural hazards (Banerjee et al., 2018). In other cases,
the households and communities, which undertake wage labour
migration, encounter conflicts or incompatibilities between migration
and agricultural livelihoods. Sustainable management of land, water
and other resources is highly labour intensive, and hence labour
mobility constrains and limits the adoption of sustainable practices
(Gilles et al., 2013). Moreover, the labour available to a household
is differentiated by age. In Northern Pakistan, where cryosphere
changes are reducing streamflow the emigration of young people
has led to a decline not only in the labour in fields and orchards,
but also a decline in the maintenance of irrigation infrastructure,
leading to an overall reduction of the agricultural livelihoods in the
community (Parveen et al., 2015).

(Parveen et al., 2015). Emigration has increased in recent decades
from two valleys in highland Bolivia which rely on glacier melt water,
as water supplies have declined, though other factors also contribute
to emigration, including land fragmentation, increasing household
needs for income, the lack of local wage-labour opportunities and
an interest among the young in educational opportunities located in
cities (Brandt et al., 2016). In Nepal, young members of high-elevation
pastoral households impacted by cryosphere change have been
increasingly engaged in tourism and labour migration since 2000
(Shaoliang et al., 2012); similar responses are reported for Sikkim
in the Indian Himalaya (Ingty, 2017). A recent study documents the
inter-generational dynamics of emigration from a livestock raising
community in the Peruvian Andes, where glacier retreat has led to
reduced streamflow that supports crucial dry season pasture (Alata
et al., 2018). Though people 50 years old or older in this community
are accustomed to living in the high pasture zones, younger people
use livestock raising as a means of accumulating capital. They sell
off their animals and move to towns at lower elevations. This loss of
young adults has reduced the capacity of households to undertake
the most demanding tasks, particularly in periods of inclement
weather, accelerating the decline of herding. As a result, the human
and animal populations of the communities are shrinking.

mountain cryosphere are evident in the observations reported in this
chapter (Section 2.3). However, uncertainties remain with detection
and attribution of key atmospheric drivers that influence much of
these climate-related changes (Section 2.2.1), due to limited spatial
density and/or temporal extent of observation records at high
elevations. For example, trends in total or solid precipitation at high
elevation remain highly uncertain, due to intrinsic uncertainties with
in situ observation methods, and large natural variability. There
are clear knowledge gaps in the distribution and characteristics
of cryospheric variables, in particular the extent and ice content
of permafrost in mountains, but also current glacier ice volumes,
trends in lake and river ice, and the spatial and temporal variation
of snow cover. These knowledge gaps persist despite a wealth of
new data since ARS especially from Earth observation satellites,
which overcome much of the remoteness and inaccessibility of high

"Two global-scale estimates of recent glacier mass changes have
been published since ARS (Wouters et al., 2019; Zemp et al., 2019)
that include area-averaged estimates for large-scale glacier regions
as defined by the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI Consortium,
2017). Zemp et al. (2019) is based on extrapolation of geodetic and
glaciological observations, while Wouters et al. (2019) use gravimetric
measurements from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment
(GRACE). For some regions, additional estimates are available mostly
based on remote sensing data (Table 2.A.1).

"These estimates were used to derive an average mass change rate
for the period 2006-2015 for each glacier region covered in both
Chapter 2 and 3. Where several estimates were available for this
period or similar periods, these were averaged and uncertainties
obtained from standard error propagation assuming the estimates
to be independent. The GRACE estimates were only considered in
regions with extensive ice cover due to generally large uncertainties
in regions with little ice cover (Wouters et al., 2019). The estimates
for the polar regions by Box et al. (2018) were not used since they
are based on an earlier version of the data by Wouters et al. (2019).

"for 2000-2009 was assumed to hold for 2006-2009, and the rate
of -12 + 5 Gt yr for 2009-2018 was assumed to be valid for 2010-
2015. For Iceland the mass change rate by Bjdrnsson et al. (2013)
for 2003-2010 was assumed to hold for 2006-2010, and the rate
by Foresta et al. (2016) for 2011-2015 was used for the remaining
years. The estimate for Iceland by Nilsson et al. (2015) for the period
2003-2009 is similar to the estimate by Bjornsson et al. (2013), but
was not used since it is based on spatially relatively scarce remote
sensing data compared to Bjérnsson et al. (2013), which is based on
detailed glaciological and geodetic balances. The GRACE estimate for
Iceland was not used since it deviates strongly from the estimate by
Zemp et al. (2019) which is well-constrained by direct observations
in this region, while the GRACE estimate may have been affected
by the mass change signal from ice masses in southeast Greenland
and processes in the Earth mantle cause by isostatic adjustments
since the end of the 19th century (Sorensen et al., 2017). For the
Low Latitudes (>99% of glacier area in the Andes) available mass
loss estimates differ considerably. Zemp et al. (2019)’s high estimate
relies on extrapolation of observations from less than 1% of the
glacier area, while the low estimate by Braun et al. (2019) for the
Andes may underestimate mass loss due to incomplete coverage
and systematic errors in their derived digital elevation models due
to radar penetration. In the absence of other estimates for this
period the average of both estimates is used. For Arctic Canada and
the Southern Andes, the estimates by Zemp et al. (2019) were not
considered since they rely on observations from less than 5% of the
glacier area. The regional estimates by Gardner et al. (2013) for the
period 2003-2009 informed AR5 and are given for comparison but
not included in the composite estimate for 2006-2015.

"This chapter assesses the state of physical, biological and social
knowledge concerning the Arctic and Antarctic ocean and cryosphere,
how they are affected by climate change, and how they will evolve
in future. Concurrently, it assesses the local, regional and global
consequences and impacts of individual and interacting polar system
changes, and it assesses response options to reduce risk and build
resilience in the polar regions. Key findings are:
"	Text
"Both polar oceans have continued to warm in recent years,
with the Southern Ocean being disproportionately and
increasingly important in global ocean heat increase (high
confidence). Over large sectors of the seasonally ice-free Arctic,
summer upper mixed layer temperatures increased at around 0.5°C
per decade during 1982-2017, primarily associated with increased
absorbed solar radiation accompanying sea ice loss, and the inflow
of ocean heat from lower latitude increased since the 2000s (high
confidence). During 1970-2017, the Southern Ocean south of 30°S
accounted for 35-43% of the global ocean heat gain in the upper
"	Text
"The Arctic and Southern Oceans are continuing to remove
carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and to acidify (high
confidence). There is medium confidence that the amount of CO
drawn into the Southern Ocean from the atmosphere has experienced
significant decadal variations since the 1980s. Rates of calcification (by
which marine organisms form hard skeletons and shells) declined in the
Southern Ocean by 3.9 + 1.3% between 1998 and 2014. In the Arctic
Ocean, the area corrosive to organisms that form shells and skeletons
using the mineral aragonite expanded between the 1990s and 2010,
with instances of extreme aragonite undersaturation. {3.2.1.2.4}
"	Text
"Arctic sea ice extent continues to decline in all months of
the year (very high confidence); the strongest reductions in
September (very likely -12.8 + 2.3% per decade; 1979-2018)
are unprecedented in at least 1000 years (medium confidence).
Arctic sea ice has thinned, concurrent with a shift to younger ice:
since 1979, the areal proportion of thick ice at least 5 years old has
declined by approximately 90% (very high confidence). Approximately
half the observed sea ice loss is attributable to increased atmospheric
greenhouse gas concentrations (medium confidence). Changes in Arctic
sea ice have potential to influence mid-latitude weather on timescales
of weeks to months (/ow to medium confidence). {3.2.1.1; Box 3.2}

confidence in projections of further Arctic warming (Overland et al., 2018a). Mechanisms for Arctic amplification are still debated,
but include: reduced summer albedo due to sea ice and snow cover loss, the increase of total water vapour content in the Arctic
atmosphere, changes in total cloudiness in summer, additional heat generated by newly formed sea ice across more extensive open
water areas in the autumn, northward transport of heat and moisture and the lower rate of heat loss to space from the Arctic relative

to interdecadal variability. This weaker amplified warming compared to the Arctic is due to deep ocean mixing and ocean heat
uptake over the Southern Ocean (Collins et al., 2013). The Southern Annular Mode (SAM), Pacific South American mode (by which
tropical Pacific convective heating signals are transmitted to high southern latitudes) and zonal-wave 3 are the dominant large-scale

"A number of recent events in the Arctic indicate new extremes in the Arctic climate system. Annual Arctic surface temperature for
each of the past five years since AR5 (2014-2018; relative to a 1980-2010 base line) exceeded that of any year since 1900 (Overland
et al., 2018b). Winter January to March) near-surface temperature anomalies of +6°C (relative to 1981-2010) were recorded in the
central Arctic during both 2016 and 2018, nearly double the previous record anomalies (Overland and Wang, 2018a). These events
were caused by a split of the tropospheric polar vortex into two cells, which facilitated the intrusion of subarctic storms (Overland and
Wang, 2016). The resulting advection of warm air and moisture from the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans into the central Arctic increased
downward longwave radiation, delayed sea ice freeze-up, and contributed to an unprecedented absence of sea ice. Delayed freeze-up

toward the North Pole (Kim et al., 2017). In addition to dramatic Arctic summer sea ice loss over the past 15 years, all Arctic winter
sea ice maxima of the last 4 years were at record low levels relative to 1979-2014 (Overland, 2018). Multi-year, large magnitude

rapid thermodynamic ice growth occurs over thin ice areas after air

less insulating snowpack (Section 3.2.1.1.6) (Sturm and Massom,

poleward wind trends in the Bellingshausen Sea push sea ice closer
to the coast (Holland and Kwok, 2012) and advect warm air to the
sea ice zone (Kusahara et al., 2017), and the reverse is true over
much of the Ross Sea. These meridional wind trends are linked to
Pacific variability (Coggins and McDonald, 2015; Meehl et al., 2016;
Purich et al., 2016b). Ozone depletion may also affect meridional

transition from perennial to seasonal sea ice (Haine and Martin,
2017; see Section 3.2.1.1.2). Other drivers include increased warm,
moist air intrusions into the Arctic during both winter (Box 3.1) and
spring (Boisvert et al., 2016; Cullather et al., 2016; Kapsch et al.,

limits a more definitive differentiation between anthropogenic versus
internal drivers of summer Arctic sea ice loss (Serreze et al., 2016;

"The proportion of Arctic sea ice at least 5 years old declined from
30% to 2% between 1979 and 2018; over the same period first-year
sea ice proportionally increased from approximately 40% to 60-70%
(Stroeve and Notz, 2018) (very high confidence) (Sections 3.2.1.1.3
and 3.2.1.1.4). Arctic sea ice has thinned through volume reductions
in satellite altimeter retrievals (Laxon et al., 2013; Kwok, 2018),
ocean-sea ice reanalyses (Chevallier et al, 2017) and in situ
measurements (Renner et al, 2014; Haas et al., 2017) (very high
confidence). Data from multiple satellite altimeter missions show
declines in Arctic Basin ice thickness from 2000 to 2012 of -0.58
+ 0.07 m per decade (Lindsay and Schweiger, 2015). Integration of
data from submarines, moorings, and earlier satellite radar altimeter
missions shows ice thickness declined across the central Arctic by
65%, from 3.59 to 1.25 m between 1975 and 2012 (Lindsay and
Schweiger, 2015). There is emerging evidence that this sea ice volume
loss may be unprecedented over the past century (Schweiger et al.,
2019). New estimates of ice thickness are available for the marginal
seas (up to a maximum thickness of ~1 metre) from low-frequency
satellite passive microwave measurements (Kaleschke et al., 2016;
Ricker et al. 2017) but data are only available since 2010. The
shift to thinner seasonal sea ice contributes to further ice extent
reductions through enhanced summer season melt via increased
energy absorption (Nicolaus et al, 2012), and it is vulnerable to
fragmentation from the passage of intense Arctic cyclones in summer
and increased ocean swell conditions (Zhang et al., 2013; Thomson
and Rogers, 2014).

"Snow accumulation on sea ice inhibits sea ice melt through a high
albedo, but the insulating properties limit sea ice growth (Sturm and
Massom, 2016) and inhibits photosynthetic light (important for in-

depress the ice below the sea level surface, which forms snow-ice
due to surface flooding. This process is widespread in the Antarctic
(Maksym and Markus, 2008) and the Atlantic Sector of the Arctic
(Merkouriadi et al., 2017), and may become more common across
the Arctic (with implications for sea ice ecosystems) as the ice

extended by 3 days per decade since 1979 due earlier melt onset,

of sea ice extent and thickness (Sections 3.2.1.1.1; 3.2.1.1.2). While
the melt onset trends are smaller, they play a large role in the earlier
development of open water (Stroeve et al., 2012b; Serreze et al.,

sea ice drift speeds have increased since 1979, both within the Arctic
Basin and through Fram Strait (Rampal et al., 2009; Krumpen et al.,

the start of observations in the early 1960s, until they disappeared
during the anomalously warm summer of 1998, and they have rarely

"Since AR5, understanding how observed changes in the Arctic can influence mid-latitude weather has emerged as a societally
important topic because hundreds of millions of people can potentially be impacted (Jung et al., 2015). The early to middle part
of the Holocene coincided with substantial decreases in net precipitation that may be due to weakening jet stream winds related
to Arctic temperatures (Routson et al., 2019). There is only /ow to medium confidence in the current nature of Arctic/mid-latitude
weather linkages because conclusions of recent analyses are inconsistent (National Research Council, 2014; Barnes and Polvani,
2015; Francis, 2017). The atmosphere interacts with the ocean and cryosphere through radiation, heat, precipitation and wind,
but a full understanding of complex interconnected physical processes is lacking. Arctic forcing on the atmosphere from loss of sea
ice and terrestrial snow is increasing, but the potential for Arctic/mid-latitude weather linkages varies for different jet stream patterns
(Grotjahn et al., 2016; Messori et al., 2016; Overland and Wang, 2018a). Connectivity is reduced by the influence of chaotic internal
natural variability and other tropical and oceanic forcing. Part of the scientific disagreement is due to irregular connections in the

heat during 1870-1995 (Figure SM3.2; Frolicher et al, 2015), of
which ~43% resided in the Southern Ocean with the remainder
redistributed to lower latitudes. Over 1970-2017, observations show
that the upper 2000 m of the ocean south of 30°S was responsible

Both models and observations show that, relative to its size (Table

gain (Table 3.1) (equivalent figures for other indicative Southern
Ocean extents are in Table SM3.2). This accords with Roemmich et al.

accounted for 67-98% of total heat gain in the upper 2000 m of the
global ocean. (The smaller proportion for 2005-2017 c.f. 2006-2013
is due to comparatively greater warming in the earlier part of the

than its long-term trend over either the preceding several decades
(1970-2004, 30-51%, Table SM3.3) or the full period 1970-2017

The Southern Ocean is the key region globally for the upwelling of interior ocean waters to the surface, enabling waters that were last

that sink back into the ocean interior. Such export of both extremely cold and dense Antarctic Bottom Water and the lighter mode and

The Southern Ocean is disproportionately important in global climate and ecological systems, being the major connection linking the
Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans in the global circulation. The horizontal circulation in the circumpolar Southern Ocean is comprised
of an eastward-flowing mean current concentrated in a series of sinuous, braided jets exhibiting strong meandering variability and
shedding small-scale transient eddies (Figure CB7.1). The mean flow circumnavigates Antarctica as the world’s largest ocean current,
the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), transporting approximately 173.3 + 10.7 x 10° m? s' (Donohue et al., 2016) of water
eastward in a geostrophic balance set up by the contrasting properties of waters around Antarctica and those inside the subtropical
gyres to the north of ACC. This contrast is maintained by a combination of strong westerly winds and ocean heat loss south of the ACC.

"Working Group | (WGl) of the IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report (AR5) assessed that there was medium confidence that the mean position
of the ACC had moved southwards in response to a contraction of the Southern Ocean circumpolar winds. Such movements can in
principle have profound effects on marine ecosystems via, e.g., changing habitat ranges for different species (e.g., Cristofari et al., 2018;
Meijers et al., 2019) (Section 3.2.3.2). Since AR5, however, substantial contrary evidence has emerged. While winds have strengthened
over the Southern Ocean, reanalysis products show no significant shift in the annual mean latitude of zonal wind jets between 1979-
2009 (Swart et al., 2015a). Similarly, a variety of methods applied to satellite data have found no long-term trend and no statistically
significant correlation of ACC position with winds (Gille, 2014; Chapman, 2017; Chambers, 2018). The discrepancy between these
studies and those assessed in WGI ARS appears to be caused by issues associated with using a fixed sea surface height contour as
a proxy for frontal position in the presence of strongly eddying fields (Chapman, 2014) and large-scale increases in sea surface height
consistent with mean global trends in sea level rise (Gille, 2014). The increase in sea surface height is ascribed largely to warming-driven
steric expansion in the upper ocean, but the mechanism driving such warming is still uncertain (Gille, 2014). These recent findings do
not preclude more local changes in frontal position, but it is now assessed as unlikely that there has been a statistically significant net
southward movement of the mean ACC position over the past 20 years.

"Trends in the atmospheric forcing of the Southern Ocean are dominated by a strengthening of westerly winds in recent decades (Swart
et al., 2015a), but there is no evidence that this enhanced wind stress has significantly altered the ACC transport. While the annual
mean value of transport is stable in the instrumental period (Chidichimo et al., 2014; Koenig et al., 2014; Donohue et al., 2016) it is
difficult to resolve changes in barotropic transport; overall there is medium confidence that ACC transport is only weakly sensitive
to changes in winds. This is consistent with longer-term analyses that find only minimal changes in ACC transport since the last
glaciation (McCave et al., 2013). Theoretical predictions and high-resolution ocean modelling suggest that the weak sensitivity of the
ACC to changes in wind stress is a consequence of eddy saturation (Munday et al., 2013), whereby the time-mean state of the ocean
remains close to a marginal condition for eddy instability and hence additional energy input from stronger winds cascades rapidly
into the smaller-scale eddy field. Satellite measurements of eddy kinetic energy over the last two decades are consistent with this,
showing a statistically significant upward trend in eddy energy in the Pacific and Indian Ocean sectors of the Southern Ocean (Hogg
et al., 2015) (medium confidence). This is supported by eddy-resolving models, which also show a marked regional variability (Patara
et al., 2016), and there is evidence that local hotspots in eddy energy, especially downstream of major topographic features including
the Drake Passage, Kerguelen Plateau, Campbell Plateau and the East Pacific Rise, may dominate the regional fields (Thompson and

Projections of future trends in the Southern Ocean are dominated by the potential for a continued strengthening of the westerly winds
(Bracegirdle et al., 2013), as well as a combination of warming and increased freshwater input from both increased net precipitation
and changes in sea ice export (Downes and Hogg, 2013). Dynamical considerations and numerical simulations indicate that, if further
increases in the westerly winds are sustained, then it is very likely that the eddy field will continue to grow in intensity (Morrison and
Hogg, 2013; Munday et al., 2013), with potential consequences for the upper-ocean overturning circulation and transport of tracers
(Abernathey and Ferreira, 2015) (including heat, carbon, oxygen and nutrients), and /ikely that the mean position and strength of the
ACC will remain only weakly sensitive to winds.

"The considerable Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) inter-model variations in Southern Ocean time-mean
circulation projections reported in WGI ARS (Meijers et al., 2012; Downes and Hogg, 2013) remain largely unchanged. Some of the
differences in projected changes have been found to be correlated with biases in the various models’ ability to simulate the historical
state of the Southern Ocean, such as mixed layer depth (Sallée et al., 2013a) and westerly wind jet latitude (Bracegirdle et al., 2013).
This suggests that bias reduction against observed historical metrics (Russell et al., 2018) in future generations of coupled models
(e.g., Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6)) should lead to improved confidence in aspects of projected Southern
Ocean changes. CMIP5 models suggest that the subduction of mode and intermediate water will increase (Sallée et al., 2013b), which
will affect oxygen and nutrient transports, and the overall transport of the Southern Ocean upper overturning cell will increase by up
to 20% (Downes and Hogg, 2013), but model performance is limited by the inability to explicitly resolve eddy processes (Gent, 2016;
Downes et al., 2018). The formation and export of Antarctic Bottom Water is predicted to continue decreasing (Heuzé et al., 2015)
due to warming and freshening of surface source waters near the continent. These are, however, some of the most poorly represented
processes in global models. Further uncertainty derives from increased meltwater from the AIS not being considered in the CMIP5
climate models, despite its potential for significant impact on Southern Ocean dynamics and the global climate, and its potential for
positive feedbacks (Bronselaer et al., 2018). Due to these uncertainties, low confidence is therefore ascribed to the CMIP5-based
model projections of future Southern Ocean circulation and watermasses.

Arctic polynyas (areas of open water surrounded by sea ice) are important because they ventilate the Arctic Ocean. The polynyas induce
bottom reaching convection on shallow shelves (Damm et al., 2018) because the warm and exposed ocean surface creates very high
heat fluxes and new sea ice formation during winter, releasing brine and creating dense water (Barber et al., 2012). On the shallow
Siberian shelves, the ocean surface waters are dominated by river runoff which is rich with sediments (Damm et al., 2018), which end
up both in the dense bottom water and in new sea ice (Bauch et al., 2012; Janout et al., 2015). This process maintains the Arctic Ocean
halocline (Bauch et al., 2011), which insulates the sea ice cover from the heat of the underlying Atlantic-derived waters.

"There is low confidence in projections of Antarctic sea ice because
there are multiple anthropogenic forcings (ozone and greenhouse
gases) and complicated processes involving the ocean, atmosphere,
and adjacent ice sheet (Section 3.2.1.1.). Model deficiencies are related
to stratification (Sallée et al., 2013a), freshening by ice shelf melt
water (Bintanja et al, 2015), atmospheric processes including clouds
(Schneider and Reusch, 2015; Hyder et al, 2018), and wind and ocean
driven processes (Purich et al., 2016a; Purich et al., 2016b; Schroeter

ice projections reduces confidence in projections of Antarctic Ice Sheet

precipitation trends (Bracegirdle et al., 2015), and impacts projected

variability results in an uncertainty of approximately 20 years in the
timing of seasonally ice-free conditions (Notz, 2015; Jahn, 2018), but
the clear link between summer sea ice extent and cumulative CO2
emissions provides a basis for when consistent ice-free conditions
may be expected (high confidence). For stabilised global warming
of 1.5°C, sea ice in September is likely to be present at end of century
with an approximately 1% chance of individual ice-free years (Notz

more frequent occurrence of an ice-free summer Arctic is expected
(around 10-35%) (Mahlstein and Knutti, 2012; Jahn et al., 2016;
Notz and Stroeve, 2016). Model simulations show that a temporary
temperature overshoot of a warming target has no lasting impact
on ice cover (Armour et al., 2011; Ridley et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013).

"Polynyas are projected to change in different ways depending on regional ice conditions and ice formation processes. Further reductions
in sea ice are projected for Arctic shelf seas which have already lost ice in recent decades (Barnhart et al., 2015; Onarheim et al., 2018)
so polynyas will cease to exist where seasonal sea ice disappears or evolve to become part of the marginal sea ice zone due to changes
in ice dynamics (ie., the North Water polynya and the Circumpolar Flaw Lead); new or enlarged polynyas could result in regions where
thinner ice becomes more effectively advected offshore, or where marine terminating glaciers increase land ice fluxes to the marine
system (medium confidence). The reduced survival rate of sea ice in the Transpolar Drift interrupts the transport of sediment-laden ice
produced from Siberian shelf polynyas (Krumpen et al., 2019), with consequences for the associated biogeochemical matter and gas
fluxes (Damm et al., 2018) (medium confidence).

"Projected changes to polynyas are important because the spring phytoplankton bloom starts early as the ocean is often well-ventilated
and nutrient rich, so the entire biological range from phytoplankton to seabirds to marine mammals thrive in polynya waters (high
confidence) (Stirling, 1997; Arrigo and van Dijken, 2004; Karnovsky et al., 2009). Secondary production and upper food web processes
are typically adapted to the early availability of energy to the system with arrival of higher trophic species (Asselin et al., 2011).
Because of the abundance of marine food resources including seals, whales and fish in and around polynyas, Arctic peoples have
hunted regularly in these areas for thousands of years (Barber and Massom, 2007). Recent implementation of Inuit-led marine
management areas acknowledge the Inuit knowledge of polynyas, and recognise the potential for development of fisheries and
other resources in polynya systems, provided these activities minimise harm on the environment and wildlife. The Inuit Circumpolar
Council's Pikialasorsuaq Commission is an example of a proposal to develop an Inuit management area in the North Water Polynya

The Antarctic continent is surrounded by coastal polynyas, which form from the combined effects of winds and landfast ice in the lee of
coastal features that protrude into the westward coastal current (Nihashi and Ohshima, 2015; Tamura et al., 2016). Intense ice growth
within these polynyas contributes to the production of Antarctic Bottom Water, the densest and most voluminous water mass in the
global ocean (Jacobs, 2004; Nicholls et al., 2008; Orsi and Wiederwohl, 2009; Ohshima et al., 2013). Sea ice production is greatest in
Ross and Weddell sea polynyas and around East Antarctica (Drucker et al., 2011; Nihashi and Ohshima, 2015; Tamura et al., 2016)

"The productivity associated with these polynyas is a critical food source for some of the most abundant top predators in Antarctic
waters, including penguins, albatross and seals (Raymond et al., 2014; Malpress et al., 2017) (Section 3.2.3.2.4). However, only
a fraction of the carbon fixed by phytoplankton in coastal polynyas is consumed by upper trophic levels. The rest sinks to the seafloor
where it is re-mineralised or sequestered (Shadwick et al., 2017), or is advected off the shelf (Lee et al., 2017b). Given the high amount
of residual macronutrients in polynya surface waters, there is evidence that future changes in ice shelf melt rates could increase water
column productivity (Gerringa et al., 2015; Rickard and Behrens, 2016; Kaufman et al., 2017), influencing Antarctic coastal ecosystems
and increasing the ability of continental shelf waters to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide (Arrigo and van Dijken, 2015).

"Antarctic coastal polynyas are biological hot-spots that support high rates of primary production (Ainley et al., 2015; Arrigo et al.,
2015) due to a combination of both high light (Park et al., 2017) and high nutrient levels, especially iron (Gerringa et al., 2015). Basal
ice shelf melt is the primary supplier of iron to coastal polynyas (Arrigo and van Dijken, 2015) although sea ice melt and intrusions
of Circumpolar Deep Water are significant in the Ross Sea (McGillicuddy et al., 2015; Hatta et al., 2017). As ice shelves retreat, the
polynyas created in their wake also increase local primary production: the new polynyas created after the collapse of the Larsen A and
B ice shelves are as productive as other Antarctic shelf regions, likely increasing organic matter export and altering marine ecosystem
evolution (Cape et al., 2013). The recent calving of Mertz Glacier Tongue in East Antarctica has altered sea ice and ocean stratification
(Fogwill et al., 2016) such that polynyas there are now twice as productive (Shadwick et al., 2017).

The Weddell Polynya is a large area of open water within the winter ice pack of the Weddell Sea close to the Maud Rise seamount
(at approximately 65°S, 3°E), and has importance on a global scale for deep water ventilation. The polynya opens intermittently, and
remained open from 1974 to 1976, with an area of 0.2-0.3 million km? (Carsey, 1980). A similar polynya appeared in spring 2017,
with a smaller area in 2016, but did not occur in 2018 (Campbell et al., 2019; Jena et al., 2019). Based on these recent events, there is
medium confidence in the drivers of Weddell Polynya formation; it forms over deep water and appears connected to sea ice divergence
created by ocean eddies (Holland, 2001) or strong winds (Campbell et al., 2019; Francis et al., 2019; Wilson et al., 2019). Around Maud
Rise, the ocean is weakly stratified, and winter sea ice formation causes brine release and the related deepening mixed layer brings
warmer deep waters towards the surface. This causes heat loss to the atmosphere above 200 W m2 (Campbell et al., 2019). These
polynya formation processes cause deep ocean convection that releases heat from the deep ocean to the atmosphere (Smedsrud,
2005), and may contribute to the uptake of anthropogenic carbon (Bernardello et al., 2014).

(medium confidence). Blooms of this size (1000s of km’) and
intensity (peaks of approximately 30 mg Chla-m-?) were previously
thought to be restricted to the marginal ice zone and the open ocean
where ample light reaches the surface ocean for rapid phytoplankton
growth (Arrigo et al., 2012). Evidence shows that these blooms
can thrive beneath sea ice in areas of reduced thickness, increased
coverage of melt ponds (Arrigo et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015; Jin

the latter has not changed significantly in the last three decades

"Alongside the mean state changes, Southern Ocean aragonite
saturation is also affected by the seasonal cycle of carbonate as
well as by the impact of reduced buffering capacity (SM3.2.4) on the
seasonal cycle of CO2 (Sasse et al., 2015; McNeil and Sasse, 2016).
This leads to an amplification of the seasonal variability of pCOz
(Hauck and Volker, 2015; McNeil and Sasse, 2016; Landschiitzer et al.,
2018) and the hydrogen ion concentration that accelerates the onset
of hypercapnia (i.e., high pCO2 levels; pCO2 > 1000 patm) to nearly
2 decades (~2085) ahead of anthropogenic C02 forcing (McNeil and
Sasse, 2016). The seasonal cycles of pH and aragonite saturation
will be attenuated (Kwiatkowski and Orr, 2018) (Section 5.2.2.3),
however when the mean state changes are combined with the
changes in seasonality, the onset of undersaturation is brought
forward by 10-20 years (Table SM3.5). Model projections remain
uncertain and affected by the resolution of local ocean physics, which
leads to overall medium confidence in the timing of undersaturation
and hypercapnia.

"Carbon uptake and storage by Antarctic benthic communities is

gains from longer algal blooms outweigh ice scour mortality in the

flux will also influence Southern Ocean ecosystem responses to climate
change (Jansen et al., 2017). Benthic communities in shallow water
habitats mostly consist of dark-adapted invertebrates and rely on sea
ice to create low-light marine environments. Increases in the amount
of light reaching the shallow seabed under climate change may
result in ecological regime shifts, in which invertebrate-dominated
communities are replaced by macroalgal beds (Clark et al., 2015;

in the Southern Ocean under RCP8.5 for 2099. Their results suggest
that 79% of Antarctica’s endemic species will face a reduction in
suitable temperature habitat (an average 12% reduction) over the
current century. Predicted reductions in the number of species are
most pronounced for the West Antarctic Peninsula and the Scotia Sea

ecosystem structure and function recognise the importance of at least
two dominant energy pathways in pelagic foodwebs — a short trophic
pathway transferring primary production to top predators via krill, and at
least one other pathway that moves energy from smaller phytoplankton
to top predators via copepods and small mesopelagic fishes — and
indicate that the relative importance of these pathways will change

period from 2011 to 2015, and 206.7 million USD yr for toothfish
fisheries (combined) over the same period (CCAMLR, 2016b). The
fishery for Antarctic krill in the southern Atlantic Sector and the
northern West Antarctic Peninsula (together the current area of
focus for the fishery) has become increasingly concentrated in space
over recent decades, which has raised concern regarding localised
impacts on krill predators (Hinke et al., 2017a). The krill fishery has
also changed its peak season of operation. In the early years of the
fishery, most krill were taken in summer and autumn, with lowest
catches being taken in spring. In recent years the lowest catches have
occurred over summer, catches have peaked in late autumn, and very
little fishing activity has occurred in spring (Nicol and Foster, 2016).
Some of these temporal and spatial shifts in the fishery over time have
been attributed to reductions in winter sea ice extent in the region

use of krill catch to produce krill oil (as a human health supplement)

priorities, tourism demand, ship building technologies and insurance
costs (Lasserre and Pelletier, 2011; Tétu et al., 2015; Johnston et al.,

Arctic shipping include a higher rate of reported accidents per km
travelled compared to southern waters (CCA, 2016), increases in
vessel noise propagation (Halliday et al, 2017) and air pollution
(Marelle et al, 2016). Disruptions to cultural and subsistence
hunting activities from increased shipping (Huntington et al., 2015;
Olsen et al. 2019) compound climate-related impacts to people
(Sections 3.4.3.3.2, 3.4.3.3.3).

satellite era using complementary methods based on time series of
satellite altimetry to measure volume change, ice-flux measurements
combined with modelled surface mass balance (SMB) to calculate
mass inputs and outputs, and satellite gravimetry to measure regional
mass change. Ice sheet changes over earlier periods have also been

uncertain and could influence future traffic volume (Zhang et al.,
2016). The Northern Sea Route is expected to be more viable than
other routes because of infrastructure already in place (Milakovic¢ et al.,
2018); favourable summer ice conditions in recent years have reduced
transit times (Aksenov et al., 2017). In comparison, the Northwest
Passage and Arctic Bridge presently have limited port and marine
transportation infrastructure, incomplete soundings and hydrographic
charting, challenging sea ice conditions and limited search and rescue
capacity; these compound the risks from shipping activity (Stephenson

"It is virtually certain that the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) and West
Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) combined have cumulatively lost mass since
widespread measurements began in 1992, and that the rate of loss has
increased since around the year 2006 and continued post-AR5 (Martin-
Espajiol et al., 2016; Zwally et al, 2017; Bamber et al., 2018; Gardner
et al, 2018; The IMBIE Team, 2018; Rignot et al, 2019), extending
and reinforcing previous findings (IPCC, 2013) (Figure 3.7, Table 3.3,
SM3.3.1.1). From medium evidence, there is high agreement in the sign
and medium agreement in the magnitude of both WAIS and AP mass
change between the complementary satellite methods (Mémin et al.,
2015; The IMBIE Team, 2018).

"Future shipping impacts will be regionally diverse considering the
unique geographies, sea ice dynamics, infrastructure and service
availability and regulatory regimes that exist across different
Arctic nations. Considerations include socioeconomic and political
implications related to safety (marine and local accidents), security
(trafficking, terrorism and local issues), and environmental and
cultural sustainability (invasive species, release of biocides,
chemicals and other waste, marine mammal strikes, fuel spills, air
and underwater noise pollution and impacts to subsistence hunting)
(Arctic Council, 2015a; Halliday et al., 2017; Hauser et al., 2018).
Black carbon emissions from shipping activity within the Arctic are
projected to increase (Arctic Council, 2017) and are more easily
deposited at the surface in the region compared with emissions from
lower latitudes (Sand et al., 2013). Commercial shipping mainly uses
heavy fuel oil, with associated emissions of sulphur, nitrogen, metals,
hydrocarbons, organic compounds, black carbon and fly ash to the
atmosphere during combustion (Turner et al., 2017a). Mitigation
approaches include banning heavy fuel oil as already implemented
in Antarctica and the waters around Svalbard, and the use of new
technology like scrubbers.

"Antarctic Ice Sheet mass changes are dominated by changes in
snowfall and glacier flow. The WAIS and AP loss trends in recent

thinning losses were -112 + 12 Gt yr for 2003-2013, largely from
the Amundsen Sea Embayment (Figure SM3.8) (Martin-Espafiol

increased by 77% since the 1970s (Mouginot et al., 2014), primarily
from acceleration of Pine Island Glacier that began around 1945, Smith,
Pope and Kohler glaciers around 1980, and Thwaites Glacier around
2000 (Mouginot et al., 2014; Konrad et al, 2017; Smith et al., 2017c).
Dynamic thinning in the Amundsen Sea Embayment and western AP

Sheet mass loss from 2008 to 2015 (Gardner et al., 2018). Glacier

dynamic-thinning losses (high confidence). On the AP, snowfall began
to increase in the 1930s, accelerated in the 1990s (Thomas et al.,

snowfall increases offset 20th century sea-level rise by 7.7 + 4.0 mm

"Mass balance contributions from ice sheet basal melting were not
described in ARS (IPCC, 2013) and the sensitivity of the AIS subglacial
hydrological system to climate change is poorly understood. Around
half of the AlS bed melts (Siegert et al, 2017), producing ~65 Gt yr!
of water (Pattyn, 2010) (low confidence), some of which refreezes (Bell,
2008) and some accumulates in subglacial lakes with a total volume of
10s of 1000s of km? (Popov and Masolov, 2007; Lipenkov et al., 2016;
Siegert, 2017). This system contributes fresh water and nutrients to the

widespread surface warming over northern GIS from 2000 to 2012

GIS near-surface summer air temperatures of 1840-2010 (+1.1°C)

"The remaining ~40% of non-SMB GIS mass loss from 1991 to 2015
has resulted from increased ice discharge due to dynamic thinning
(high confidence) (Enderlin et al., 2014; van den Broeke et al., 2016;
King et al., 2018) (Figure 3.7). From 2000 to 2016, dynamic thinning of
89% of GIS outlet glaciers accounted for -682 + 31 Gt mass change,
of which 92% came from the northwest and southeast GIS (King
et al, 2018). Half came from only four glaciers (Jakobshavn Isbree,
Kangerdlugssuaq, Koge Bugt, and Ikertivaq South) (Enderlin et al.,
2014). Glacier thinning has decreased glacier discharge, however,
reducing the dynamic contribution to GIS mass loss (e.g., from 58%
from 2000 to 2005 to 32% between 2009 and 2012; Enderlin et al.,
2014). Furthermore, there is now high confidence that for most of
the GIS, increased surface melt has not led to sustained increases
in glacier flux on annual timescales because subglacial drainage
networks have evolved to drain away the additional water inputs

"Only around half of the 1960-2014 surface melt ran off, most of the
rest being retained in firn and snow (Steger et al., 2017), particularly
in recently observed firn aquifers in south and west Greenland
(Humphrey et al., 2012; Forster et al., 2013; Munneke et al., 2014;
Poinar et al., 2017) that cover up to 5% of GIS (Miége et al., 2016;
Steger et al., 2017) and stored around one fifth of the meltwater

While potential aquifer storage is equivalent to about a quarter of
annual GIS melt production (Koenig et al., 2014; van den Broeke et al.,
2016) and aquifers have spread to higher altitudes (Steger et al., 2017),
their potential to buffer runoff has been reduced by firn densification
(Polashenski et al., 2014), diversion of water to the bed via crevasses
(Poinar et al., 2017), and the formation of ice layers that prevent
drainage and promote surface ponding on the firn (Charalampidis
et al., 2016) (high confidence). Such ponding lowers the firn albedo,
promoting further melting (high confidence) (e.g., Charalampidis
et al., 2015), but the extent of bare ice is a fivefold stronger control
on melt (Ryan et al., 2019). Bare ice produced ~78% of runoff from
1960 to 2014, and its extent is expected to increase non-linearly as
snow cover retreats to higher, flatter areas of ice sheet (Steger et al.,
2017). This extent is not well reproduced in climate models, however,
with biases of -6% to 13% (Ryan et al., 2019).

changes in the post-AR5 period, and /ow confidence in how
stratification changes are affecting sea ice and basal ice shelf melt.
An increase in stratification caused by release of freshwater from the
AIS was invoked as a mechanism to suppress vertical heat flux and
permit an increase in sea ice extent (Bintanja et al., 2013; Bronselaer
et al., 2018; Purich et al., 2018), though some studies conclude that
glacial freshwater input is insufficient to cause a significant sea ice
expansion (Swart and Fyfe, 2013; Pauling et al., 2017) (Section 3.2.1.1).
In contrast, where warm water intrusions drive melting within ice
shelf cavities, a significant entrained heat flux to the surface can
exist and increase stratification and potentially reduce sea ice extent
(Jourdain et al., 2017; Merino et al., 2018). It has been argued that
freshening from glacial melt can enhance basal melting of ice shelves
by reducing dense water production and modulating oceanic heat
flow into ice shelf cavities (Silvano et al., 2018).

"Little information is available on Holocene and historic changes
in glaciers in Antarctica (separate from the ice sheet), and on
sub-Antarctic islands (Hodgson et al., 2014). Mass changes of glaciers
in these regions between 2006 and 2015 (-90 + 860 Gt yr"") have low
confidence as they are based on a single data compilation with large
uncertainties in the Antarctic region (Zemp et al., 2019) (Figure 3.8).
Limited evidence with high agreement from individual glaciers
suggests that regional variability in glacier mass changes may be
linked to changes in the large-scale Southern Hemisphere atmospheric
circulation (Section 3.3.1.5.2). On islands adjacent to the AP, glaciers
experienced retreat and mass loss during the mid to late 20th century,
but since around 2009 there has been a reduction in mass loss rate
or a return to slightly positive balance (Navarro et al., 2017; Oliva
et al., 2017). Reduced mass loss has been linked to increased winter
snow accumulation and decreased summer melt at these locations,
associated with recent deepening of the circumpolar pressure trough
(Oliva et al., 2017). Conversely, on the sub-Antarctic Kerguelen Islands,
increased glacier mass loss (Verfaillie et al., 2015) may be due to
reduced snow accumulation rather than increased air temperature as
a result of southward migration of storm tracks (Favier et al., 2016).

"The future dynamic response of the AIS to warming will largely be determined by changes in ice shelves, because their thinning
or collapse will reduce their buttressing capacity, leading to an acceleration of the grounded ice and to thinning of the ice margin. In
turn, this thinning can initiate grounding line retreat (Konrad et al., 2018). If the grounding line is located on bedrock sloping downwards
toward the ice sheet interior (retrograde slope), initial retreat can trigger a positive feedback, due to non-linear response of the
seaward ice flow to the grounding line thickness change. As a result, progressively more ice will flow into the ocean (Figure CB8.1a).

"Accumulation and percolation of surface melt and rain water also impact ice shelves by lowering albedo, deepening surface crevasses,
and causing flexural stresses that can lead to hydrofracturing and ice shelf collapse (Macayeal and Sergienko, 2013). In some cases
supraglacial (ie., flowing on the glacier surface) rivers might diminish destabilising impact of surface melt by removing meltwater
before it ponds on the ice shelf surface (Bell et al., 2017). In summary, both ocean forcing and surface melt affect ice shelf mechanical
stability (high confidence), but the precise importance of the different mechanisms remains poorly understood and observed.

"In many places around the AIS margin, the seaward-flowing ice forms floating ice shelves (Figure CB8.1). Ice shelves in contact with
bathymetric features on the sea floor or confined within embayments provide back stress (buttressing) that impedes the seaward
flow of the upstream ice and thereby stabilises the ice sheet. The ice shelves are thus a key factor controlling AlS dynamics. Almost
all Antarctic ice shelves provide substantial buttressing (First et al., 2016) but some are currently thinning at an increasing rate
(Khazendar et al., 2016). Today, thinning and retreat of ice shelves is associated primarily with ocean driven basal melt that, in turn,
promotes iceberg calving (Section 3.3.1.2).

"For Greenland and Svalbard, there is limited evidence with high
agreement that the retreat of marine-terminating glaciers will alter
food supply to higher trophic levels of marine food webs (Meire et al.,
2017; Milner et al, 2017). The consequences of changes in glacial
systems on marine ecosystems are often mediated via the fjordic
environments that fringe the edge of the ice sheets, for example
changing physical-chemical conditions have affected the benthic
ecosystems of Arctic fjords (Bourgeois et al., 2016). The amplification
of nutrient fluxes caused by enhanced upwelling at calving fronts
(Meire et al., 2017), combined with high carbon/nutrient burial and
recycling rates (Wehrmann et al., 2013; Smith et al, 2015), plays
an important role in sustaining high productivity of the Arctic fjord
ecosystems of Greenland and Svalbard (Lydersen et al., 2014). Glacier
retreat, causing glaciers to shift from being marine-terminating to
land-terminating, can reduce the productivity in coastal areas
off Greenland with potentially large ecological implications, also
negatively affecting production of commercially harvested fish (Meire
et al., 2017). There is also evidence that marine-terminating glaciers
are important feeding areas for marine mammals and seabirds at
Greenland (Laidre et al., 2016) and Svalbard (Lydersen et al., 2014).

"For Antarctica, there is high agreement based on medium evidence
that ice shelf retreat or collapse is leading to new marine habitats
and to biological colonisation (Gutt et al., 2011; Fillinger et al, 2013;
Trathan et al., 2013; Hauquier et al., 2016; Ingels et al., 2018). The loss
of ice shelves and retreat of coastal glaciers around the AP in the last
50 years has exposed at least 2.4 x 104 km? of new open water. These
newly-revealed habitats have allowed new phytoplankton blooms
to be produced resulting in new marine zooplankton and seabed
communities (Gutt et al., 2011; Fillinger et al, 2013; Trathan et al.,

in enhanced carbon uptake by coastal marine ecosystems (medium

uptake are highly variable (Trathan et al., 2013; Barnes et al., 2018).
Newly available habitat on coastlines may also provide breeding
or haul out sites for land-based predators such as penguins and
seals (Trathan et al., 2013) (low confidence). Fjords that have been
studied in the subpolar western AP are hotspots of abundance and
biodiversity of benthic macro-organisms (Grange and Smith, 2013)

several major Amundsen Sea outlets, including Thwaites, Pine Island, Smith, and Kohler glaciers (e.g., Rignot et al., 2014) supporting
the MISI hypothesis, although observed grounding line retreat on retrograde slope is not definitive proof that MISI isunderway.

"The disappearance of ice shelves may allow the formation of ice cliffs, which may be inherently unstable if they are tall enough
(subaerial cliff height between 100 and 285 m) to generate stresses that exceed the strength of the ice (Parizek et al., 2019). This ice
cliff failure can lead to ice sheet retreat via a process called marine ice cliff instability (MICI; Figure CB8.1b), that has been hypothesised
to cause partial collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) within a few centuries (Pollard et al., 2015; DeConto and Pollard, 2016).

"This self-sustaining process is known as Marine Ice Sheet Instability (MISI). The onset and persistence of MISI is dependent on several
factors in addition to overall bed slope, including the details of the bed geometry and conditions, ice shelf pinning points, lateral shear
from the walls, self-gravitation effects on local sea level and isostatic adjustment. Hence, long-term retreat on every retrograde sloped
bed is not necessarily unstoppable (Gomez et al., 2015).

"One of the largest outlets of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS), Totten glacier, has also been retreating and thinning in recent decades (Li

has been in the previous warm periods (Aitken et al., 2016). It is not clear, however, if the changes observed recently are a linear response
to increased ocean forcing (Section 3.3.1.2), or an indication that MISI has commenced (Roberts et al., 2018).

"Figure CB8.1 | Schematic representation of Marine Ice Sheet Instability (MISI, a) and Marine Ice Cliff Instability (MICI, b) from Pattyn (2018). (a) thinning of the
buttressing ice shelf leads to acceleration of the ice sheet flow and thinning of the marine-terminated ice margin. Because bedrock under the ice sheet is sloping
towards ice sheet interior, thinning of the ice causes retreat of the grounding line followed by an increase of the seaward ice flux, further thinning of the ice margin,
and further retreat of the grounding line. (b) disintegration of the ice shelf due to bottom melting and/or hydro-fracturing produces an ice cliff. If the cliff is tall
enough (at least ~800 m of total ice thickness, or about 100 m of ice above the water line), the stresses at the cliff face exceed the strength of the ice, and the cliff
fails structurally in repeated calving events. Note that MISI requires a retrograde bed slope, while MICI can be realised on a flat or seaward-inclined bed. Like MISI,
the persistence of MICI depends on the lack of ice shelf buttressing, which can stop or slow brittle ice failure at the grounding line by providing supportive backstress.

ice mass removal (Kingslake et al., 2018), thus supporting the stabilising role of glacial isostatic adjustment on ice sheets (Barletta et al.,

sites in the Northern Hemisphere circumpolar permafrost region
(AMAP, 2017d) (Figure 3.10) (very high confidence). At some
locations, the temperature is 2°C-3°C higher than 30 years ago.
During the decade between 2007 and 2016, the rate of increase in
permafrost temperatures was 0.39°C + 0.15°C for colder continuous

discontinuous zone permafrost, giving a global average of 0.29
+ 0.12°C across all polar and mountain permafrost (Biskaborn et al.,

warmer sites indicate that permafrost is thawing with heat absorbed
by the ice-to-water phase change, and as a result, the active layer may
be increasing in thickness. In contrast to temperature, there is only
medium confidence that active layer thickness across the region has
increased. This confidence level is because decadal trends vary across
regions and sites (Shiklomanov et al., 2012) and because mechanical
probing of the active layer can underestimate the degradation
of permafrost in some cases because the surface subsides when
ground ice melts and drains (Mekonnen et al., 2016; AMAP, 2017d;

would be caused by increasing air temperature alone. This process

wildfire that affects the ground thermal regime (Jones et al., 2015a).
There is medium confidence in the importance of abrupt thaw for
driving change in permafrost at the circumpolar scale because
it occurs at point locations rather than continuously across the
landscape, but the risk for widespread change from this mechanism
remains high because of the rapidity of change in these locations
(Kokelj et al., 2017; Nitze et al., 2018). New research at the global
scale has revealed that 3.6 x 10° km2, about 20% of the northern
permafrost region, appears to be vulnerable to abrupt thaw (Olefeldt

"The current inventory has also highlighted additional carbon pools
that are likely to be present but are so poorly quantified (low
confidence) that they cannot yet be added into the number reported
above. There are deep terrestrial soil/sediment deposits outside of the
Yedoma region that may contain about 400 Pg C (Schuur et al., 2015).
An additional pool is organic carbon remaining in permafrost but that
is now submerged on shallow Arctic sea shelves that were formerly
exposed as terrestrial ecosystems during the Last Glacial Maximum
~20,000 years ago (Walter et al., 2007). This permafrost is degrading
slowly due to seawater intrusion, and it is not clear what amounts
of permafrost and organic carbon still remain in the sediment versus
what has already been converted to greenhouse gases. A recent
synthesis of permafrost extent for the Beaufort Sea shelf showed
that most remaining subsea permafrost in that region exists near
shore with much reduced area (high confidence) as compared to
original subsea permafrost maps that outlined the entire 3 x 10° km?
shelf area (<120 m below sea level depth) that was formerly exposed
as land (Ruppel et al., 2016). These observations are supported by
similar studies in the Siberian Arctic Seas (Portnov et al., 2013), and
by modelling that suggests that subsea permafrost would be thawed
many meters below the seabed under current submerged conditions

warming has been linked to increased wildfire activity in the boreal
forest regions in Alaska and western Canada where this has been
studied (Gillett, 2004; Veraverbeke et al., 2017). Based on satellite
imagery, an estimated 80,000 km? of boreal area was burned
globally per year from 1997 to 2011 (van der Werf et al., 2010;
Giglio et al., 2013). Extreme fire years in northwest Canada during
2014 and Alaska during 2015 doubled the long-term (1997-2011)
average area burned annually in this region (Canadian Forest Service,
2017), surpassing Eurasia to contribute 60% of the global boreal
area burned (van der Werf et al., 2010; Randerson et al., 2012; Giglio
et al., 2013). These extreme North American fire years were balanced
by lower-than-average area burned in Eurasian forests, resulting in
a 5% overall increase in global boreal area burned. The annual area
burned in Arctic tundra is generally small compared to the forested
boreal biome. In Alaska — the only region where estimates of burned
area exist for both boreal forest and tundra vegetation types — tundra
burning averaged approximately 270 km? yr! during the last half
century (French et al., 2015), accounting for 7% of the average annual
area burned throughout the state (Pastick et al., 2017). There is high
confidence that changes in the fire regime are degrading permafrost
faster than had occurred over the historic successional cycle (Turetsky
et al., 2011; Rupp et al, 2016; Pastick et al., 2017), and that the
effect of this driver of permafrost change is under-represented in the
permafrost temperature observation network.

intensified thermokarst activity and subsequent ponding (resulting
in lake/wetland expansion), observations of change in surface water
coverage across the Arctic are regionally variable (Nitze et al., 2017;
Ulrich et al., 2017; Pastick et al., 2019). In landscapes with degrading
ice-wedge polygons, subsidence can reduce inundation, increase
runoff, and decrease surface water (Liljedahl et al., 2016; Perreault
et al., 2017). In discontinuous permafrost, thaw opens up pathways
of subsurface flow, improving the connection among inland water
systems which supports the drainage of lakes and overall reduction
in surface water cover (Jepsen et al., 2013). Enhanced subsurface
connectivity from thaw in discontinuous permafrost serves tempers
short-term lake fluctuations (Rey et al., 2019).

Increased cold-season precipitation is projected across the Arctic

"alone, if the rates of these disturbances increase. The observed
trend of increasing fire is projected to continue for the rest of the
century across most of the tundra and boreal region for many climate
scenarios, with the boreal region projected to have the greatest
increase in total area burned (Balshi et al., 2009; Kloster et al., 2012;
Wotton et al., 2017). Due to vegetation-climate interactions, there is
only medium confidence in projections of future area burned. As fire
activity increases, flammable vegetation, such as the black spruce
forest that dominates boreal Alaska, is projected to decline as it is
replaced by low-flammability deciduous forest (Johnstone et al., 2011;
Pastick et al., 2017). In other regions such as western Canada, by
contrast, black spruce could be replaced by the even more flammable
jack pine, creating regional-scale feedbacks that increase the spread
of fire on the landscape (Héon et al., 2014). A regional process-model
study of Alaska projected annual median area burned during the
21st century to be 1.3-1.7 times higher compared with the historical
average (Pastick et al., 2017). Fire also appears to be expanding as
a novel disturbance into tundra and forest-tundra boundary regions
previously protected by a cool, moist climate (Jones et al., 2009; Hu

burned in Alaska is projected to double under RCP6.0 from a historic

et al., 2015).A statistical approach projected a fourfold increase in the
30-year probability of fire occurrence in the forest-tundra boundary
by 2100 (Young et al., 2017). In contrast to fire, there has not yet
been a comprehensive circumpolar projection of how abrupt thaw
rates may change in the future, but one component of abrupt thaw,
change in abrupt thaw lake area, has been projected to increase to
increase by 53% under RCP8.5 (Walter Anthony et al., 2018) above
the 1.4 x 10° km? of small lakes and ponds that currently exist in
the permafrost region (Muster et al., 2017). As a result, there is low
confidence in the ability to assess the magnitude by which abrupt
thaw across the entire landscape will affect regional permafrost,

important for projecting future change (Kokelj et al., 2017).

"Climate warming is expected to change the storage of carbon in
vegetation and soils in northern regions, and net carbon transferred
to the atmosphere as CO2 and methane acts as a feedback to
accelerate global climate change. There is high confidence that the
northern region acted as a net carbon sink as carbon accumulated in
terrestrial ecosystems over the Holocene (Loisel et al., 2014; Lindgren
et al., 2018). There is medium evidence with low agreement whether
changing climate in the modern period has shifted these ecosystems
into net carbon sources. Syntheses of ecosystem CQ fluxes have
alternately showed tundra ecosystems as carbon sinks or neutral
averaged across the circumpolar region for the 1990s and 2000s
(McGuire et al., 2012), or carbon sources over the same time period
(Belshe et al., 2013). Both syntheses agree that the summer growing
season is a period of net carbon uptake into terrestrial ecosystems
(high confidence), and this uptake appears to be increasing as
a function of vegetation density/biomass (Ueyama et al., 2013). The
discrepancy between these syntheses may be a result of CO2 release
rates during the non-summer season that are now thought to be
higher than previously estimated (high confidence) (Webb et al., 2016)
or the separation of upland and wetland ecosystem types, which was
done in one synthesis but not the other. Moisture status is a primary
control over ecosystem carbon sink/source strength with wetlands
more often than not still acting as annual net carbon sinks even while
methane is emitted (Lund et al., 2010). Recent aircraft measurements
of atmospheric CO2 concentrations over Alaska showed that
tundra regions of Alaska were a consistent net COz source to the

(Figure 3.11) (medium confidence). Expert assessment and laboratory
soil incubation studies suggest that substantial quantities of C (tens to
hundreds Pg C) could potentially be transferred from the permafrost
carbon pool into the atmosphere under RCP8.5 (Schuur et al., 2013;
Schadel et al., 2014)4. Global dynamical models supported these
findings, showing potential carbon release from the permafrost zone
ranging from 37-174 Pg C by 2100 under high emission climate
warming trajectories, with an average across models of 92 + 17 Pg C
(mean = SE) (Zhuang et al., 2006; Koven et al., 2011; Schaefer et al.,
2011; MacDougall et al., 2012; Burke et al., 2013; Schaphoff et al.,
2013; Schneider von Deimling et al., 2015). This range is generally
consistent with several newer data-driven modelling approaches that
estimated that soil carbon releases by 2100 (for RCP8.5) will be 57
Pg C (Koven et al., 2015) and 87 Pg C (Schneider von Deimling et al.,
2015), as well as an updated estimate of 102 Pg C from one of the
previous models (MacDougall and Knutti, 2016). However, the latest
model runs performed with either structural enhancements to better
represent permafrost carbon dynamics (Burke et al., 201 7a), or common
environmental input data (McGuire et al., 2016) show similar soil carbon
losses, but also indicate the potential for stimulated plant growth
(nutrients, temperature/growing season length, COz fertilisation) to
offset some (Kleinen and Brovkin, 2018) or all of these losses, at least
during this century, by sequestering new carbon into plant biomass and
increasing carbon inputs into the surface soil (McGuire et al., 2018).
These future carbon emission levels would be a significant fraction of
those projected from fossil fuels with implications for allowable carbon
budgets that are consistent with limiting global warming, but will also
depend on how vegetation responds (high confidence). Furthermore,
there is high confidence that climate scenarios that involve mitigation
(e.g., RCP4.5) will help to dampen the response of carbon emissions

additional 1.6-5 Tg CHa yr"" over the last 60 years (Walter Anthony
et al, 2014). At the same time, there is high confidence that methane
fluxes at the ecosystem to regional scale have been under-observed, in
part due to the low solubility of methane in water leading to ebullution
(bubbling) flux to the atmosphere that is heterogeneous in time
and space. Some new quantifications include: cold-season methane
emissions that can be >50% of the annual budget of terrestrial
ecosystems (Zona et al., 2016); geological methane seeps that may
be climate sensitive if permafrost currently serves as a cap preventing
atmospheric release (Walter Anthony et al., 2012; Ruppel and Kessler,
2016; Kohnert et al., 2017); estimates of shallow Arctic Ocean shelf
methane emissions where the range of estimates based on methane
concentrations in air and water has widened with more observations
and now ranges from 3 Tg CHa yr (Thornton et al, 2016) to 17 Tg
CHa yr“ (Shakhova et al., 2013). Observations such as these underlie
the fact that source estimates for methane made from atmospheric
observations are typically lower than methane source estimates made
from upscaling of ground observations (e.g., Berchet et al., 2016), and
this problem has not improved, even at the global scale, over several
decades of research (Saunois et al., 2016; Crill and Thornton, 2017).

"In many of the dynamical model projections previously discussed,
methane release is not explicitly represented because fluxes are
small even though higher global warming potential of methane
makes these emissions relatively more important than on a mass
basis alone. Global models that do include methane show that
emissions may already (from 2000 to 2012) be increasing at a rate
of 1.2 Tg CHa yr! in the northern region as a direct response
to temperature (Riley et al., 2011; Gao et al., 2013; Poulter et al.,
2017). A model intercomparison study forecast northern methane
emissions to increase from 18 Tg CHa yr! to 42 Tg CHa yr! under
RCP8.5 by 2100 largely as a result of an increase in wetland extent
(Zhang et al, 2017). However, projected methane emissions are
sensitive to changes in surface hydrology (Lawrence et al., 2015) and
a suite of models that were thought to perform well in high-latitude
ecosystems showed a general soil drying trend even as the overall
water cycle intensified (McGuire et al, 2018). Furthermore, most
models described above do not include many of the abrupt thaw
processes that can result in lake expansion, wetland formation, and
massive erosion and exposure to decomposition of previously frozen
carbon-rich_ permafrost, leading to medium confidence in future
model projections of methane. Recent studies that addressed some
of these landscape controls over future emissions projected increases
in methane above the current levels on the order 10-60 Tg CHa yr“!
under RCP8.5 by 2100 (Schuur et al., 2013; Koven et al., 2015;
Lawrence et al., 2015; Schneider von Deimling et al., 2015; Walter
Anthony et al., 2018). These additional methane fluxes are projected
to cause 40-70% of total permafrost-affected radiative forcing in
this century even though methane emissions are much less than CO2
by mass (Schneider von Deimling et al., 2015; Walter Anthony et al.,
2018). As with total carbon emissions, there is high confidence that
mitigation of anthropogenic methane sources could help to dampen
the impact of increased methane emissions from the Arctic and
boreal regions (Christensen et al., 2019).

"Projections of tundra vegetation distribution across the Arctic by
2050 in response to changing environmental conditions suggest
that the areal extent of most tundra types will decrease by at least
50% (Pearson et al., 2013) (medium confidence). Woody shrubs and
trees are projected to expand to cover 24-52% of the current tundra
region by 2050, or 12-33% if tree dispersal is restricted. Adding
to this, the expansion of fire into tundra that has not experienced
large-scale disturbance for centuries causes large reductions in soil
carbon stocks (Mack et al., 2011), shifts in vegetation composition
and productivity (Bret-Harte et al., 2013), and can lead to widespread
permafrost degradation (Jones et al., 2015a) at faster rates than
would occur by changing environmental conditions alone. In tundra
regions, graminoid (grasses and sedges) tundra is projected to be
replaced by more flammable shrub tundra in future climate scenarios,
and tree migration into tundra could further increase fuel loading

"Similar to tundra, boreal forest vegetation shows trends of both
greening and browning over multiple years in different regions across
the satellite record (Beck and Goetz, 2011; Ju and Masek, 2016) (high
confidence). Here, patterns of changing vegetation are a result of
direct responses to changes in climate (temperature, precipitation
and seasonality) and other driving factors for vegetation (nutrients,
disturbance) similar to what has been reported in tundra. While boreal
forest may expand at the northern edge (Pearson et al., 2013), climate
projections suggest that it could diminish at the southern edge and
be replaced by lower biomass woodland/shrublands (Koven, 2013;
Gauthier et al, 2015) (medium confidence). Furthermore, changes in
fire disturbance are leading to shifts in landscape distribution of early
and late successional ecosystem types, which is also a major factor in
satellite trends. Fires that burn deeply into the organic soil layer can
alter permafrost stability, hydrology and vegetation. Loss of the soil
organic layer exposes mineral soil seedbeds (Johnstone et al., 2009),
leading to recruitment of deciduous tree and shrub species that do
not establish on organic soil Johnstone et al., 2010). This recruitment
has been shown to shift post-fire vegetation to alternate successional
trajectories Johnstone et al., 2010). Model projections suggest that
Alaskan boreal forest soon may cross a point where recent increases
in fire activity have made deciduous stands as abundant as spruce
stands on the landscape (Mann et al., 2012) (medium confidence).
This projected trend of increasing deciduous forest at the expense
of evergreen forest is mirrored in Russian and Chinese boreal forests
as well (Shakhova et al., 2013; Shuman et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2017)
(medium confidence).

enhanced summer precipitation increases lichen biomass, while an
increase in winter precipitation lowers it (Kumpula et al., 2014). Fire
disturbance reduces the amount of pasture available for domestic
reindeer and increases predation on herding lands (Lavrillier and
Gabyshev, 2017). Later ice formation on waterbodies can impact
herding activities (Turunen et al., 2016). Ice formation from rain-on-

of catastrophic mass starvation (Bartsch et al., 2010; Forbes et al.,

observed Rangifer changes. Hunting and predation (the latter
exacerbated by modification of the landscape for exploration and
resource extraction; Dabros et al., 2018) increase in importance
as populations decline. Climate strongly influences productivity:
extremes in heat, drought, winter icing and snow depth reduce
Rangifer survival (Mallory and Boyce, 2017). Changes in the timing
of sea ice formation have direct effects on risks during Rangifer
migration via inter-island movement and connection to the mainland
(Poole et al., 2010). Summer warming is changing the composition
of tundra plant communities, modifying the relationship between
climate, forage and Rangifer (Albon et al., 2017), which also impacts
other Arctic species such as musk ox (Ovibos moschatus) (Schmidt
et al., 2015). As polar trophic systems are highly connected (Schmidt
et al., 2017), changes will propagate through the ecosystem with
effects on other herbivores such as geese and voles, as well as
predators such as wolves (Hansen et al., 2013; Klaczek et al, 2016).

"Climate-driven changes in seasonal ice and permafrost conditions
influence water quality (high confidence). Shortened duration of
freshwater ice cover (more light absorption, increased nutrient
input) is expected to result in higher primary productivity (Hodgson
and Smol, 2008; Vincent et al., 2011; Griffiths et al, 2017b) and
may also encourage greater methane emissions from Arctic lakes
(Greene et al., 2014; Tan and Zhuang, 2015). Thaw slumps, active
layer detachments and peat plateau collapse affect surface water
connectivity (Connon et al., 2014) and enhance sediment, particulate
and solute fluxes in river and stream networks (Kokelj et al, 2013).
The transfer of enhanced nutrients from land to water (driven by
active layer thickening and thermokarst processes; Abbott et al.,
2015; Vonk et al., 2015) has been linked to heightened autotrophic
productivity in freshwater ecosystems (Wrona et al., 2016). Still, there
is low confidence in the influence of permafrost changes on dissolved
organic carbon, because of competing mechanisms that influence
carbon export. Permafrost thaw could contribute to the mobilisation of
previously frozen organic carbon (Abbott et al., 2014; Wickland et al.,
2018; Walvoord et al., 2019) thereby enhancing both particulate and
dissolved organic carbon export to aquatic systems. Increased delivery
of this dissolved carbon from enhanced river discharge to the Arctic
Ocean (Section 3.4.3.1.2) can exacerbate regionally extreme aragonite
undersaturation of shelf waters (Semiletov et al, 2016) driven by
ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 (Section 3.2.1.2.4). Conversely,
reduced dissolved organic carbon export could accompany permafrost
thaw as (1) water infiltrates deeper and has longer residence times
for decomposition (Striegl et al., 2005) and (2) the proportion of
groundwater (typically lower in dissolved organic carbon and higher
in DIC than runoff) to total streamflow increases (Walvoord and
Striegl, 2007). Increased thermokarst also has the potential to impact
freshwater cycling of inorganic carbon (Zolkos et al., 2018).

Surface water loss, reduced surface water connectivity among aquatic
habitats, and changes to the timing and magnitude of seasonal flows
(Section 3.4.1.2) result in a direct loss of spawning, feeding, or rearing
habitats (Poesch et al, 2016). Changes to permafrost landscapes

to increased sea temperature and retreating sea ice. This includes capelin (Ingvaldsen and Gjoszeter, 2013), Atlantic cod (Kjesbu

floor. Simultaneous with rising sea temperatures and retreating sea ice, these Arctic fishes are being replaced by boreal, fast-growing,
large-bodied generalist fish moving in from the south. These large, migratory predators take advantage of increased production while
the Arctic fish species suffer from higher competition and predation and are retracting northwards and eastwards. Consequently,
climate change is inducing structural change over large spatial scales, leading to a borealisation (‘Atlantification’) of the European
Arctic biological communities (Fossheim et al., 2015; Kortsch et al., 2015; Frainer et al., 2017) (medium confidence).

"Expansion of subarctic terrestrial species and biological communities into the Arctic and displacing native species is considered

northward. Here, the most vulnerable species and communities may be in the species-poor, but unique, northernmost sub-zone of the
Arctic because species cannot migrate northward as southern species encroach (CAVM Team, 2003; Walker et al., 2016; AMAP, 2018).
This ‘Arctic squeeze’ is a combined effect of the fact that the area of the globe increasingly shrinks when moving poleward and that
there is nowhere further north on land to go for terrestrial biota at the northern coast. The expected overall result of these shifts and
limits will be a loss of biodiversity (CAFF, 2013a; CAFF, 2013b; AMAP, 2018) (medium confidence). At the southern limit of the Arctic,
thermal hotspots may support high biological productivity, but not necessarily high biodiversity (Walker et al., 2015) and may even
act as advanced bridgeheads for expansion of subarctic species into the true Arctic (medium confidence). At the other end of the
Arctic zonal range, a temperature increase of only 1°C-2°C in the northernmost subzone may allow the establishment of woody dwarf
shrubs, sedges and other species into bare soil areas that may radically change its appearance and ecological functions (Walker et al.,
2015; Myers-Smith et al., 2019) (medium confidence).

"Alien species are a major driver of terrestrial biodiversity change also in the Antarctic region (Frenot et al., 2005; Chown et al., 2012;
McClelland et al., 2017). The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty restricts the introduction of non-native
species to Antarctica as do the management authorities of sub-Antarctic islands (De Villiers et al., 2006). Despite this, alien species
and their propagules continue to be introduced to the Antarctic continent and sub-Antarctic islands (Hughes et al., 2015). To date, 14
non-native terrestrial species have colonised the Antarctic Treaty area (excluding sub-Antarctic islands) (Hughes et al., 2015), while the
number in the sub-Antarctic is much higher (on the order of 200 species) (Frenot et al., 2005) (low confidence). Species distribution
models for terrestrial invasive species indicate that climate does not currently constitute a barrier for the establishment of invasive
species on all subantarctic islands, and that the AP region will be the most vulnerable location on the Antarctic continent to invasive
species establishment under RCP8.5 (Duffy et al., 2017). Thus, for continental Antarctica, existing climatic barriers to alien species
establishment will weaken as warming continues across the region (medium confidence). An increase in the ice-free area linked to
glacier retreat in Antarctica is expected to increase the area available for new terrestrial ecosystems (Lee et al., 2017a). Along with
growing number of visitors, this is expected to increase in the establishment probability of terrestrial alien species (Chown et al., 2012;
Hughes et al., 2015) (medium confidence).

"Many northern communities rely on ponds, streams and lakes for
drinking water (Cochran et al., 2013; Goldhar et al, 2013; Nymand
and Fondahl, 2014; Daley et al., 2015; Dudley et al, 2015; Masina
et al, 2019), so there is high confidence that projected changes in
hydrology will impact water supply (Section 3.4.2.2). Surface water
is vulnerable to thermokarst disturbance and drainage, as well as
bacterial contamination, the risks of which are increased by warming
ground and water temperatures (Cozzetto et al., 2013; Goldhar
et al., 2013; Dudley et al., 2015; Masina et al., 2019). Icebergs or
old multi-year ice are important sources of drinking water for some
coastal communities, so reduced accessibility to stable sea ice
conditions affects local water security. Small remote communities
have limited capacity to respond quickly to water supply threats,
which amplifies vulnerabilities to water security (Daley et al., 2015).
"	Text
"There is high confidence that both risks and opportunities arise for
coastal communities with changing sea ice and open water conditions.
Of particular concern for coastal communities is landfast sea ice
(Section 3.3.1.1.5), which creates an extension of the land in winter
that facilitates travel (Inuit Circumpolar Council Canada, 2014). The
floe edge position, timing and dynamics of freeze-up and break-up,
sea ice stability through the winter, and length of the summer open
water season are important indicators of changing ice conditions
and safe travel (Gearheard et al., 2013; Eicken et al., 2014; Baztan
et al., 2017). Warming water temperature, altered salinity profiles,
snow properties, changing currents and winds all have consequences
for the use of sea ice as a travel or hunting platform (Hansen et al.,
2013; Eicken et al., 2014; Clark et al., 2016a). More leads (areas
of open water), especially in the spring, can mean more hunting
opportunities such as whaling off the coast of Alaska (Hansen et al.,
2013; Eicken et al., 2014). In Nunavut, a floe edge closer to shore
improves access to marine mammals such as seals or narwhal (Ford
et al., 2013). However, these conditions also hamper access to coastal
or inland hunting grounds (Hansen et al., 2013; Durkalec et al., 2015),
have increased potential for break-off events at the floe edge (Ford
et al., 2013), or can result in decreased presence (or total absence) of
ice-associated marine mammals with an absence of summer sea ice
(Eicken et al., 2014).

"There is high confidence in indicators that food insecurity risks are on
the rise for Indigenous Arctic peoples. Food is strongly tied to culture,
identity, values and ways of life (Donaldson et al., 2010; Cunsolo Willox
et al, 2015; Inuit Circumpolar Council-Alaska (ICC-AK), 2015); thus,
impacts to food security go beyond access to food and physical health.
Food systems in northern communities are intertwined with northern
ecosystems because of subsistence hunting, fishing and gathering
activities. Environmental changes to animal habitat, population sizes
and movement mean that culturally important food species may no
longer be found within accessible ranges or familiar areas (Parlee and
Furgal, 2012; Rautio et al., 2014; Inuit Circumpolar Council-Alaska
(ICC-AK), 2015; Lavrillier et al, 2016) (Section 3.4.3.2.2). This impacts
negatively the accessibility of culturally important local food sources
(Lavrillier, 2013; Rosol et al., 2016) that make important contributions
to a nutritious diet (Donaldson et al., 2010; Hansen et al., 2013; Dudley
et al, 2015). Longer open water seasons and poorer ice conditions on
lakes impact fishing options (Laidler, 2012) and waterfowl hunting
(Goldhar et al., 2014). Permafrost warming and increases in active
layer thickness (Section 3.4.1.3) reduce the reliability of permafrost
for natural refrigeration. In some cases these changes have reduced
access to, and consumption of, locally resourced food and can result
in increased incidence of illness (Laidler, 2012; Cochran et al., 2013;
Cozzetto et al., 2013; Rautio et al., 2014; Beaumier et al., 2015). These
consequences of climate change are intertwined with processes of
globalisation, whereby complex social, economic and cultural factors
are contributing to a dietary transformation from locally resourced
foods to imported market foods across the Arctic (Harder and Wenzel,
2012; Parlee and Furgal, 2012; Nymand and Fondahl, 2014; Beaumier
etal. 2015). Limiting exposures to zoonotic, foodborne and waterborne
pathogens (Section 3.4.3.2.2) depends on accurate and comprehensive
data on species diversity, biology and distribution and pathways for
invasion (Hoberg and Brooks, 2015; Kafle et al, 2018).

community development quotas. This intricate regulatory framework
has inherent risks and benefits to fishers and industry by limiting
flexibility (Anderson et al. 2017b). To address these challenges,

abandonment of traditional food storage and drying practices

emphasis on community self-reliance, such as use of household and

"Adaptation by subsistence users to climate change falls into several
categories. In some cases harvesters are shifting the timing of
harvesting and the selection of harvest areas due to changes in
seasonality and access to traditional use areas (AMAP, 2017a;
AMAP, 2017b; AMAP, 2018). Changes in the navigability of rivers
(ie., shallower) and more open (i.e., dangerous) seas have resulted in
harvesters changing harvesting gear, such as shifting from propeller
to jet-propelled boats or all-terrain vehicles, and to larger ocean-going
vessels for traditional whaling (Brinkman et al., 2016). In many cases,
using different gear results in an increase in fuel costs (e.g., jet boats
are about 30% less efficient). Unsafe ice conditions have resulted in
greater risks of travel on rivers and the ocean in the frozen months.
In Savoonga, Alaska, whalers reported limitations in harvesting
larger bowhead because of thin ice conditions that do not allow for
safe haul outs, and as a result, community residents now anticipate
a greater dependence on western Alaska’s reindeer as a source of
meat in the future (Rosales and Chapman, 2015). Harvesters have
also responded with switching of harvested species and in some
cases doing without (AMAP, 2018). In many cases, adaption has
allowed for continued provisioning of wildfoods in spite of climate
change impacts (BurnSilver et al., 2016; AMAP, 201 7a; Fauchald et al.,

response to climate change (i.e., icing events and early spring runoffs

to change migration routes or take deer to other pastures. In practice,
however, the full set of challenges has meant more Yamal herders
opting out of the traditional collective migration partially or entirely
to manage their herds privately. The reason to have private herds
is one of adaptive advantage; smaller, privately owned herds are
nimbler in the face of rapid changes in land cover and the expansion
of infrastructure (Forbes, 2013). The same logic has more recently
been applied by some herders in the wake of recent rain-on-snow

"The growth of the polar tourism market is, in part, a response to
climate change, as travellers seek ‘last-chance’ opportunities, which,
in turn, is creating new challenges in governance (Section 3.2.4.2).
Polar-class expedition cruise vessels are now, for the first time, being
purposefully built for recreational Arctic sea travel. The anticipated
near- and long-term growth of Arctic tourism, especially with small
vessels (yachts) Johnston et al., 2017), points to a deficiency in current
regulations and policies to address human safety, environmental
risks and cultural impacts. Industry growth also points to the need
for operators, governments, destination communities and others to
identify and evaluate adaptation strategies, such as disaster relief
management plans, updated navigation technologies for vessels, codes
of conduct for visitors and improved maps (Pizzolato et al, 2016) and
to respond to perceptions of tourism by residents of local destinations
(Kajan, 2014; Stokke and Haukeland, 2017). Efforts were initiated
with stakeholders in Arctic Canada to identify strategies that would
lower risks (Pizzolato et al., 2016); a next step to lower risks and build
resilience is to further develop those strategies (AMAP, 2017a; AMAP,
2017b; AMAP, 2018). Opportunities for tourism vessels in the Arctic to
contribute to international research activities (‘ships of opportunity’)

"Climate change in some Arctic regions is facilitating easier access
to natural resources (Section 3.5.2.3), which may generate financial
capital for Arctic residents and their governments, including
Indigenous peoples but also greater exposure to risks such as
oil spills and increases in noise. Receding sea ice and glaciers has
opened new possibilities for development, such as areas of receding
glaciers of eastern Greenland (Smits et al. 2017). As mineral
development commenced in Greenland, its home rule government
developed environmental impact assessment protocols to provide
for improved public participation (Forbes et al, 2015). Indigenous
peoples are considered as non-state actors and in many, but not
all cases, promote environmental protection in support of the
sustainability of their traditional livelihoods. This protection is at
times in opposition to the industrial development business sector,
which is well-funded and lobbies strongly. Bilateral agreements for
resource development in the Arctic are typically state dominated and
controlled, and are negotiated with powerful non-state actors, such
as state-dominated companies (Young, 2016). Among the non-state
actors, new networks and economic forums have been established
(Wehrmann, 2016). One example is the Arctic Economic Council,
created by the Arctic Council during 2013-2015 as an independent

climate change adaptation planning at the local level have previously
been identified: formal analytical models need to be relevant to
the concerns and needs of stakeholders, experts should be made
sensitive to community perspectives, information should be packaged

in adaptation planning has been closely linked to transnational
municipal networks that foster social learning and in which local
governments assume a role as key players (Sheppard et al., 2011;

can be a catalyst for action and promoting innovation, there remain

that the current international legal framework is inadequate when
applying a precautionary approach at the regional level (medium

Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the
North East Atlantic, which applies only to the North East Atlantic, and
that provides a framework for implementation of the United Nations

"In the Arctic, responses to climate change do not only lead to
international governance cooperation but also to competition
in access to natural resources, especially hydrocarbons. With ice
retreating and thinning, and improved access to natural resources,
coastal states are increasingly recurring to the option to invoke Article
76 of the UNCLOS (Art. 76 UNCLOS; Verschuuren, 2013) and seek to
demonstrate with scientific data, submitted to the Commission on
the Limits of Continental Shelf, and within a set timeline, that their
continental shelf is extended. In that case they can enjoy sovereign
rights beyond the EEZ. It is very unlikely that this new trend from
states to refer to Article 76 will lead to future (military) conflicts

"In both polar regions, cooperative approaches to regional governance
have been developed to allow for the participation of non-state actors.
In some cases, regimes allow for a substantial level of participation
by specific groups of the civil society Jabour, 2017; Keil and Knecht,
2017). For example, in the Antarctic Treaty System, the Antarctic Treaty
Parties included the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research into
their Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.
In the Arctic, the status of Permanent Participants has enabled the
effective participation of Indigenous Peoples in the work of the
Council (Pincus and Ali, 2016). Climate change has contributed to
modifying the balance between the interests of state and non-state
actors, leading to changing forms of cooperation (Young, 2016).
While such changes and modifications occur in both the Arctic and
Antarctic, the role of states has remained present in all the regimes
and sectors of human responses (Young, 2016; Jabour, 2017).

the Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea and the Convention for

environmental and climate regimes that are implemented and
managed through regional regimes (such as the Kyoto Protocol or
the Paris Agreement) are also relevant for the Antarctic Treaty and
its Protocol on Environmental Protection, which requires, amongst
other issues, a minimisation of adverse environmental impacts.
Cooperation in the Antarctic also occurs through the the Convention
for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. Climate
change and its consequences for the marine environment are
a central issue for this Convention because it challenges ways to
regulate and manage fisheries and designate and manage Marine
Protected Areas. Nevertheless, CCAMLR has not agreed to any
climate change program and at its most recent meeting, there was
again no agreement to do so (Brooks et al. (2018), CCAMLR Report

The Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) is the collective term for the
Antarctic Treaty and related agreements. The ATS regulates
international relations with respect to Antarctica. 54 countries have
acceded to the Treaty and 29 of them participate in decision making
as Consultative Parties. 27 countries are Party to the CCAMLR, and
40 have ratified the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the
Antarctic Treaty. The importance of understanding, mitigating and
adapting to the impacts of changes to the Southern Ocean and
Antarctic cryosphere has been realised by all of the major bodies
responsible for governance in the Antarctic region (south of 60°S).
The Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties agreed that a Climate
Change Response Work Programme would address these matters
(ATCM, 2016). This led to the establishment of the Subsidiary Group
of the Committee for Environmental Protection on Climate Change
Response (ATCM, 2017). By contrast, consensus is currently limiting
work programme-level responses to climate change by CCAMLR
(2017a), while opportunities exist to incorporate climate concerns
into mechanisms for implementation and monitoring aimed to

"Despite lacking the role to enact hard law, three binding agreements
were negotiated under the auspices of the Council (in its task forces),
the latest of which is the Agreement on Enhancing International
Arctic Scientific Cooperation, which is an indication that the Council
is preparing a regulatory role to respond to climate change in the
Arctic using hard-law instruments (Morgera and Kulovesi, 2016;
Shapovalova, 2016). Through organising the Task Force on Black
Carbon and Methane (Morgera and Kulovesi, 2016), the Council has
catalysed action on short-lived climate forcers as the task force was
followed by the adoption in 2015 of the Arctic Council Framework for
Action on Enhanced Black Carbon and Methane Emission Reductions.
In this non-legally binding agreement, Arctic States lay out a common
vision for national and collective action to accelerate decline in black
carbon and methane emissions (Shapovalova, 2016). The Council
thereby moved from merely assessing problems to attempting to
solve them (Baker and Yeager, 2015; Young, 2016; Koivurova and
Caddell, 2018). While mitigation of global emissions from fossil fuels
requires global cooperation, progress with anthropogenic emissions
of short-term climate forcers (such as black carbon and methane) may
be achieved through smaller groups of countries (Aakre et al., 2018).
However, even though the Council has also embraced the Ecosystem
Approach, it does not have a mandate to manage climate-related risks
and impacts, or apply a precautionary approach, on fisheries issues.

have limited comparability and generalisability (Ford and King,

The identification and on-going use of indicators of social-ecological
resilience are theoretically best achieved through highly participatory
processes that engage stakeholders of a locale, with those processes
potentially resulting in self-reflection and actions that improve
adaptive capacity (Quinlan et al., 2016; Carson and Sommerkorn,

"Community-based monitoring (CBM) in the Arctic has emerged as
a practice of great interest because of its potential to link western
ways of knowing with local knowledge and indigenous knowledge
(Retter et al., 2004; Johnson et al., 2015a; Johnson et al., 2015b;
Kouril et al., 2016; AMAP, 2017a; Williams et al., 2018). In several
CBM programs, innovative approaches using the internet, mobile
phones, hand-held information devices, and camera-equipped
GPS units are capturing, documenting and communicating local
observations of change (Brubaker et al., 2011; Brubaker et al., 2013).
The integration of community observations with instrument-based
observations and its use in research has proven challenging, with
technical and cultural issues (Griffith et al, 2018). Execution of
CBM programs in the Arctic has also proven to be labour intensive
and difficult to sustain, requiring long-term financial support,
agreements specifying data ownership, sufficient human capital,
and in some cases, the involvement of boundary organisations that
provide technical support (Pulsifer et al., 2012; Eicken et al. 2014)
and link CBM with governance (CAFF, 2015b; Robards et al., 2018).
As is the case in all knowledge production, power relationships
(ie, who decides what is a legitimate observation, who has access to
resources for involvement and who benefits) have been challenging
where the legitimacy of local knowledge and indigenous knowledge
is questioned (e.g., Pristupa et al, 2018). There is high agreement
and limited evidence that CBM facilitates knowledge co-production
and resilience building. More analyses of Arctic communities and
their institutional capabilities related to CBM are needed to evaluate
the potential of these observation systems, and experimentation
and innovation may help determine how CBM can more effectively
inform decision making beyond the community Johnson et al.,
2015a; Johnson et al., 2015b) (medium confidence).

"regions, scientists and policy makers often work in separate spheres
of influence, tend to maintain different values, interests, concerns,
responsibilities and perspectives, and gain limited exposure to the
other's knowledge system (see Liu et al., 2008; Armitage et al,
2011). Information exchange flows unequally, as officials struggle
with information overload and proliferating institutional voices,
and where local residents are mistrusting of scientists (Powledge,
2012). Inherent tensions between science-based assessment and
interest-based policy, and many existing institutions often prevent
direct connectivity. Further, the longstanding science mandate
to remain ‘policy neutral’ typically leads to norms of constrained

"Participatory scenario analysis is a quickly evolving and widely
used practice in polar regions, and has proven particularly useful
for supporting climate adaptation at multiple scales when it uses
a social-ecological perspective (ARR, 2016; AMAP, 2017a; Crépin
et al., 2017; Planque et al., 2019) (medium confidence). While there
are technical dimensions in scenario analysis and planning (e.g., the
building of useful simulation models that capture and communicate
nuanced social-ecological system dynamics such as long-fuse big
bang processes, pathological dynamics, critical thresholds, and
unforeseen processes (Crépin et al., 2017), there are also creative
aspects, such as the use of art to help in the visualisation of possible

"Structured decision making (SDM) is an emerging practice used with
stakeholders to identify alternative actions, evaluate trade-offs, and
inform decisions in complex situations (Gregory et al., 2012). Few
SDM processes have been undertaken in polar regions, with most
as exploratory demonstration projects led by researchers. These have
included indigenous residents and researchers identifying trade-offs
and actions related to subsistence harvesting in a changing
environment (Christie et al., 2018) stakeholder interviews to show
how a ‘triage method’ can link community monitoring with community
needs and wildlife management priorities (Wheeler et al., 2018), and
the application of multi-criteria decision analysis to address difficult
decisions related to mining opportunities in Greenland (Trump et al.,
2018). The Decision Theater North at the University of Alaska is also
being explored as an innovative method of decision support (Kofinas
et al., 2016). SDM may have potential in creating climate resilience
pathways in polar regions (low confidence), but there is currently
limited experience with its application.

"A review of scenario analysis in the Arctic, however, found that while
the practice is widespread and many are using best practice methods,
less than half scenarios programs incorporated climate projections
and that those utilising a backcasting approach had higher local
participation than those only using forecasting (Flynn et al., 2018).
It noted that integrating different knowledge systems and attention
to cultural factors influence program utility and acceptance. Planque
et al. (2019) also found that most participating stakeholders had
limited experience using scenario analysis, suggesting the importance
of process methods for engaging stakeholders when exploring
possible, likely, and desirable futures. The long-term utility of this
practice in helping stakeholders engage with each other to envision
possible futures and be forward thinking in decision making will
depend on the science of climate projections, further development
of decision support systems to inform decision makers, attention to
cultural factors and worldview, as well as refinement of processes
that facilitate participants’ dialogue (medium confidence).

"Creating pathways towards greater climate resilience will therefore
depend, in part, on a redefined ‘actionable science’ that creates
bridges supporting better decisions through more rigorous, accessible,
and engaging products, while shaping a narrative that instils public
confidence (Beier et al, 2015; Fleming and Pyenson, 2017) (high
confidence). Stakeholders of polar regions are increasingly using
a suite of creative tools and practices for moving from theory to
practice in resilience building by informing decision making and
fostering long-term planning (Baztan et al., 2017). As noted above,
these practices include participatory scenario planning, forecasting
for stakeholders, and use structured decision making, solution
visualisation tools and decision theatres (e.g., Schartmiller et al., 2015;
Kofinas et al. 2016; Garrett et al, 2017; Holst-Andersen et al.,
2017; Camus and Smit, 2019). The extent to which these practices
can contribute to resilience building in the future will depend, in part,
on the willingness of key actors such as scientists, to provide active
decision-support services, more often than mere decision-support
products (Beier et al., 2015). While progress has been made in linking
science with policy, more enhanced data collaboration at every
scale, more strategic social engagement, communication that both
informs decisions and improves climate literacy and explicit creation
of consensus documents that provide interpretive guidance about
research implications and alternative choices will be important
(high confidence).

"This chapter has assessed the consequences of climate change in the
polar regions in three sections, focusing on sea ice and the ocean
(Section 3.2), glaciers and ice sheets (Section 3.3), and permafrost and
snow on land (Section 3.4). A systems approach was taken to assess
individual and interacting changes within and between these elements
to consider consequences, impacts and risks for marine and terrestrial
ecosystems and for people. Mapping on to those observed and
projected impacts, Section 3.5 assessed human responses to climate
change in the polar regions. This brief synopsis considers the chapter
findings across sections, and draws out three key assessment points
that inform global responses to polar ocean and cryosphere change.

"Shifts in the distribution, abundance and human use of species and
populations due to climate-induced cryosphere and ocean change,
concurrent with land use changes, increase the risks to ecosystem
health and biodiversity (Kaiser et al, 2015). Building resilience in these
challenging conditions follows from spatial planning for biodiversity
that links multiple scales and considers how impacts to ecosystems
may materialise in social-ecological systems elsewhere (Bengtsson
et al., 2003; Cumming, 2011; Allen et al., 2016). Developing pathways
for spatial resilience in polar regions involves systematic planning
and designating networks of protected areas to protect connected
tracts of representative habitats, and biologically and ecologically
significant features (Ban et al., 2014). Protected area networks
that combine both spatially rigid and spatially flexible regimes
with climate refugia can support ecological resilience to climate
change by maintaining connectivity of populations, foodwebs, and
the flow of genes across scales (McLeod et al., 2009). This approach
reduces direct pressures on biodiversity, and thus gives biological
communities, populations and ecosystems the space to adapt
(Nystrém and Folke, 2001; Hope et al., 2013; Thomas and Gillingham,
2015) (medium confidence). Networks of protected areas are now
being planned (Solovyev et al., 2017) and implemented (Juvonen and

"‘Adaptive Ecosystem Governance’ differs from conventional resource
management or integrated ecosystem management (Chapin Ill et al.,
2009; Chapin III et al., 2010; Chapin Ill et al., 2015), with a strong
focus on trajectories of change (i.e., emergence), implying that
maintaining ecosystems in a state of equilibrium is not possible
(Biggs et al., 2012; ARR, 2016). This approach strengthens response
options by maintaining or increasing resource diversity (to support
human adaptation) and biological diversity (to support ecosystem
adaptation) (Biggs et al. 2012; Chapin Ill et al, 2015; Quinlan
et al., 2016) (high confidence). Adaptive ecosystem governance
emphasises iterative social learning processes of observing,
understanding and acting with collaborative partnerships, such as
adaptive co-management arrangements currently used in regions of
the Arctic (Armitage et al., 2009; Dale and Armitage, 2011; Chapin III
et al, 2015; Arp et al., 2019). This approach is also currently realised
through adaptive management of Arctic fisheries in Alaska that
combines annual measures and within-season provisions informed
by assessments of future ecosystem trends (Section 3.5.2.1), and the
use of simulation models with Canadian caribou co-management
boards to assess the cumulative effects of proposed land use change
with climate change (Gunn et al., 2011; Russell, 2014a; Russell,
2014b). Linking these regional efforts to pan-polar programs can
enhance resilience building cross multiple scales (e.g., Gunn et al.,
2013) (medium confidence).

"Incorporating measures of ecosystem services into assessments
is key in integrating environmental, economic, and social policies
that build resilience to climate change in polar regions (CAFF,
2015a; Malinauskaite et al., 2019; Sarkki and Acosta Garcia, 2019)
(high confidence). Currently, there is limited recognition of the
wide range of benefits people receive from polar ecosystems and
a lack of management tools that demonstrate their benefits in
decision-making processes (CAFF, 2015a). The concept of ecosystem
services is increasingly used in the Arctic, yet there continues to be
significant knowledge gaps in mapping, valuation, and the study
of the social implications of changes in ecosystem services. There
are few Arctic examples of the application of ecosystem services in
management (Malinauskaite et al., 2019). A strategy of ecosystem
stewardship, therefore, is to maintain a continued flow of ecosystem
services, recognising how their benefits provide incentives for
preserving biodiversity, while also ensuring options for sustainable
development and ecosystem-based adaptation (Chapin Ill
et al, 2015; Guerry et al., 2015; Diaz et al., 2019). Arctic stewardship
opportunities at landscape, seascape, and community scales to
a great extent lie in supporting culturally engrained (often traditional
indigenous) values of respect for land and animals, and reliance on
the local environment through the sharing of knowledge and power
between local users of renewable resources and agencies responsible
for managing resources (Mengerink et al., 2017) (high confidence). In
the Antarctic, ecosystem stewardship is dependent on international
formally-defined and informally-enacted cooperation, and the
recognition of its service to the global community (Section 3.5.3.2).

"By the end of this century, Arctic sea ice and snow on land are projected
to be diminished compared with today, as are the masses of theAlS and
GIS and the polar glaciers (Sections 3.2.2, 3.3.2; 3.4.2). Acidification
of both polar oceans will have progressed; this, and changing marine
habitats associated with ocean warming, are projected to impact
marine ecosystems (Sections 3.2.2, 3.2.3). Permafrost thaw and
decrease in snow on land are projected to drive habitat and biome
shifts, affecting ranges and abundance of ecologically important
species, and driving changes in wildfire, vegetation and human
infrastructure (Sections 3.4.2, 3.4.3). Collectively, these very different
future polar environments pose strong challenges to sustainable use
of natural resources, infrastructure, cultures and lives and livelihoods.
Although manifested locally, these very different future polar

"Compared with high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, projections
using low emissions scenarios result in polar regions that will
be significantly less altered. For example, for stabilised global
warming of 1.5°C, a sea ice-free Arctic in September is projected
to occur significantly less frequently than at 2°C (1% c.f. 10-35%)
(Section 3.2.2). The potential for reduced but stabilised Arctic
autumn and spring snow extent by mid-century for RCP2.6 contrasts
with continued loss under RCP8.5, and the area with near-surface
permafrost is projected to decrease less by 2100 under RCP2.6 than
under RCP8.5 (Section 3.4.2). Polar glaciers are projected to lose
much less mass between 2015 and 2100 under RCP2.6 compared
with RCP8.5 (Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 2). Acidification of the
polar oceans will progress more slowly and affect much smaller areas
under RCP2.6 compared with RCP8.5 (Section 3.2.2). These differences
have strong implications for natural resource management, economic
sectors and Arctic cultures (Section 3.5.2). The choices that enable
these differences influence the rate and magnitude of polar change,
their consequences and impacts at regional and global scales, the
effectiveness of adaptation and opportunities for climate resilient

"The polar regions influence the global climate through a number of processes. As spring snow and summer sea
ice cover decrease, more heat is absorbed at the surface. There is growing evidence that ongoing changes in
the Arctic, primarily sea ice loss, can potentially influence mid-latitude weather. As temperatures increase in the
Arctic, permafrost soils in northern regions store less carbon. The release of carbon dioxide and methane from
the land to the atmosphere further contributes to global warming.

"The Southern Ocean that surrounds Antarctica is the main region globally where waters at depth rise to the
surface. Here, they become transformed into cold, dense waters that sink back to the deep ocean, storing
significant amounts of human-produced heat and dissolved carbon for decades to centuries or longer, and
helping to slow the rate of global warming in the atmosphere. Future changes in the strength of this ocean
circulation can so far only be projected with limited certainty.

"Melting ice sheets and glaciers in the polar regions cause sea levels to rise, affecting coastal regions and their
large populations and economies. At present, the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) and polar glaciers are contributing
more to sea level rise than the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS). However, ice loss from the AIS has continued to accelerate,
driven primarily by increased melting of the underside of floating ice shelves, which has caused glaciers to flow
faster. Even though it remains difficult to project the amount of ice loss from Antarctica after the second half of
the 21st century, it is expected to contribute significantly to future sea level rise.

Reduced Arctic sea ice cover allows greater access to offshore petroleum resources and ports supporting resource

"Among the risks to societies and economies, aspects of food provision, transport and access to non-renewable
resources are of great importance. Fisheries in the polar oceans support regional and global food security and
are important for the economies of many countries around the world, but climate change alters Arctic and
Antarctic marine habitats, and affects the ability of polar species and ecosystems to withstand or adapt to
physical changes. This has consequences for where, when, and how many fish can be captured. Impacts will
vary between regions, depending on the degree of climate change and the effectiveness of human responses.
While management in some polar fisheries is among the most developed, scientists are exploring modifications
to existing precautionary, ecosystem-based management approaches to increase the scope for adaptation to
climate change impacts on marine ecosystems and fisheries.

"Each finding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement. A level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers: very low, low, medium, high and
very high, and typeset in italics, e.g., medium confidence. The following terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or a result: virtually certain
99-100% probability, very likely 90-100%, likely 66-100%, about as likely as not 33-66%, unlikely 0-33%, very unlikely 0O-10%, exceptionally unlikely 0-1%. Assessed
likelihood is typeset in italics, e.g., very likely. This is consistent with AR5 and the other AR6 Special Reports. Additional terms (extremely likely 95-100%, more likely than
not >50-100%, more unlikely than likely 0-<50%, extremely unlikely 0—5%) are used when appropriate. This Report also uses the term ‘likely range’ or ‘very likely range’
to indicate that the assessed likelihood of an outcome lies within the 17-83% or 5~95% probability range. For more details see {1.9.2, Figure 1.4}.

Statements about uncertainty in Section 4.2 are contingent upon the RCP or other emissions assumptions that accompany them. In Section 4.4, the entirety of information
facing a decision maker is taken into consideration, including the unknown path of future emissions, in assessing uncertainty. Depending on which perspective is chosen,
uncertainty may or may not be characterised as ‘deep’.

"Coastal ecosystems are already impacted by the combination
of SLR, other climate-related ocean changes, and adverse
effects from human activities on ocean and land (high
confidence). Attributing such impacts to SLR, however, remains
challenging due to the influence of other climate-related and
non-climatic drivers such as infrastructure development and
human-induced habitat degradation (high confidence). Coastal
ecosystems, including saltmarshes, mangroves, vegetated dunes and
sandy beaches, can build vertically and expand laterally in response
to SLR, though this capacity varies across sites (high confidence).
These ecosystems provide important services that include coastal
protection and habitat for diverse biota. However, as a consequence
of human actions that fragment wetland habitats and restrict
landward migration, coastal ecosystems progressively lose their
ability to adapt to climate-induced changes and provide ecosystem
services, including acting as protective barriers (high confidence).

"GMSL was considerably higher than today during past climate
states that were warmer than pre-industrial, including the
Last Interglacial (LIG; 129-116 ka), when global mean surface
temperature was 0.5°C-1.0°C warmer, and the mid-Pliocene
Warm Period (mPWP; ~3.3 to 3.0 million years ago), 2°C-4°C
warmer. Despite the modest global warmth of the Last
Interglacial, GMSL was likely 6-9 m higher, mainly due to
contributions from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets
(GIS and AIS, respectively), and unlikely more than 10m higher
(medium confidence). Based on new understanding about
geological constraints since the IPCC 5th Assessment Report
(AR5), 25 m is a plausible upper bound on GMSL during the
mPWP (low confidence). Ongoing uncertainties in palaeo sea level
reconstructions and modelling hamper conclusions regarding the
total magnitudes and rates of past sea level rise (SLR). Furthermore,
the long (multi-millennial) time scales of these past climate and
sea level changes, and regional climate influences from changes in
Earth's orbital configuration and climate system feedbacks, lead to
low confidence in direct comparisons with near-term future changes.

and relocation of sediment (high confidence). Under favourable

with fast rates of SLR (e.g., >10 mm yr), but this capacity varies
significantly depending on factors such as wave exposure of the

"Future rise in GMSL caused by thermal expansion, melting

strongly dependent on which Representative Concentration
Pathway (RCP) emission scenario is followed. SLR at the end
of the century is projected to be faster under all scenarios,
including those compatible with achieving the long-term
temperature goal set out in the Paris Agreement. GMSL will
rise between 0.43 m (0.29-0.59 m, likely range; RCP2.6) and
0.84 m (0.61-1.10 m, likely range; RCP8.5) by 2100 (medium

continue to rise for centuries due to continuing deep ocean heat
uptake and mass loss of the GIS and AIS and will remain elevated

challenges to hard protection increase with higher sea levels and will

more to biophysical limits of EbA. For corals, limits may be reached
during this century, due to ocean acidification and ocean warming,
and for tidal wetlands due to pollution and infrastructure limiting
their inland migration. Limits to accommodation are expected to occur
well before limits to protection occur. Limits to retreat are uncertain,

"1. Climate-change induced GMSL rise is caused by thermal expansion
of ocean water and ocean mass gain, the latter primarily due to a
decrease in land-ice mass. However, responses to SLR are local and
hence always based on RSL experienced at a particular location.
GMSL is modified regionally by climate processes and locally by
a variety of factors, some driven or influenced by human activity.
Of particular relevance for responding to SLR is anthropogenic
subsidence, which can lead to rates of RSL rise that exceed those
of climate-induced SLR by an order of magnitude, specifically in
delta regions and near cities (4.2.2.4). In these subsiding regions,
one available response to prepare for future climate-induced SLR
is to manage and reduce anthropogenic subsidence (4.4.2).

and long term investment in critical infrastructure) may also consider
SLR above this range, because there is a 17% chance that GMSL
will exceed 0.59 m under RCP2.6 and 1.10 m under RCP8.5 in 2100.
Process-model based studies cannot yet provide this information, but
expert elicitation studies show that a GMSL of 2 m in 2100 cannot be
ruled out (4.2.3).

"Despite the large uncertainty in late 21st century SLR, progress in
adaptation planning and implementation is feasible today and may be
economically beneficial. Many coastal decisions with time horizons of
decades to over a century are made today (e.g., critical infrastructure,
coastal protection works, city planning, etc.) and accounting for
relative SLR can improve these decisions. Decision-analysis methods
specifically targeting situations of large uncertainty are available and,
combined with suitable planning, public participation and conflict
resolution processes, can improve outcomes (high confidence; 4.4.4.2,
4.4.4.3). For example, adaptation pathway analysis recognises and
enables sequenced long-term decision making in the face of dynamic
coastal risk characterised by deep uncertainty (medium evidence, high
agreement; 4.4.4.3.4). The use of these decision-analysis tools can
be integrated into statutory land use or spatial planning provisions
to formalise these decisions and enable effective implementation by
relevant governing authorities (4.4.4.2).

"After an increase of sea level from 1-2 mm yr in most regions over
the past century, rates of 3-4 mm yr are now being experienced that
will further increase to 4-9 mm yr"" under RCP2.6 and 10-20 mm yr“!
at the end of the century under RCP8.5. Nevertheless, up to 2050,
uncertainty in climate change-driven future sea level is relatively
small, which provides a robust basis for short-term (£30 years)
adaptation planning. GMSL will rise between 0.24 m (0.17-0.32 m,
likely range) under RCP2.6 and 0.32 m (0.23-0.40 m, likely range)
under RCP8.5 (medium confidence; 4.2.3). The combined effect of
mean and extreme sea levels results in events which are rare in the
historical context (return period of 100 years or larger; probability
<0.01 yr) occurring yearly at some locations by the middle of this
century under all emission scenarios (4.2.3.4.1; high confidence). This
includes, for instance, those parts of the intertropical low-lying coasts
that are currently exposed to storm surges only infrequently. Hence,
additional adaptation is needed irrespective of the uncertainties in
future global GHG emissions and the Antarctic contribution to SLR.

remain elevated for thousands of years (high confidence; 4.2.3.5).
Only a few modelling studies are available for SLR beyond 2100.
However, all studies agree that the difference in GMSL between
RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 increases substantially on multi-centennial and
millennial time scales (very high confidence). On a millennial time
scale, this difference is about 10 metres in some model simulations,
whereas it is only several decimetres at the end of 21st century.
The larger the emissions the larger the risks associated with SLR as
already assessed in $R1.5. Under RCP8.5 the few available studies

"In many places, however, non SLR-related, local environmental and
human dimensions of exposure and vulnerability play a critical
role in increasing exposure and vulnerability to coastal hazards
(Section 4.3.2.5). For example, the ability of morphological and
ecological systems (Sections 4.3.3.3 and 4.3.3.5) to protect human
settlements and infrastructure by attenuating ESL events and
stabilising shorelines is progressively being lost due to coastal squeeze,
pollution, habitat degradation and fragmentation (Section 4.3.3.5.4;
high confidence). Hence, an important near term response to RSL rise
is to reduce these adverse environmental and human dimensions
of exposure and vulnerability. In addition, the drivers of exposure
and vulnerability vary across different coastal contexts ranging
from resource-rich cities to small islands (Sections 4.3.3, 4.3.4).
Accordingly, effective responses need to be context-specific, and
address the locality-specific drivers of risk.

Arctic communities remote from regions of rapid glacial-isostatic adjustment have been selected for this assessment. N.B (2): according to the specific scope of the chapter,

further significant intensification of action nor new types of actions). (B) ‘Maximum potential response’ represents the opposite situation, that is, an ambitious combination
of both incremental and transformational adaptation that leads to significant additional efforts compared to today and to (A). Here, the authors assume adaptation
implemented at its full potential, that is, the extent of adaptation that is technologically possible, with minimal financial, social and political barriers.

"Along sparsely populated rural coasts, safeguarding communities
by conserving coastal ecosystems and natural morphodynamic
processes, and restoring those already degraded, is the central
element of an integrated strategy. Intact coastal ecosystems can
protect settlements and, in some contexts, natural sedimentation
processes and avoiding sand mining can help to raise exposed land
(4.4.2.2). Hard coastal protection can lead to flooding or erosion
elsewhere (4.4.2.2.5), and the destruction of ecosystems and the
coastal protection they offer (4.3.3.5). Ecosystem health can be
further maintained by reducing non-climatic drivers such as those
that interrupt sediment flows in deltas and estuaries (4.3.2.3). Hard
protection may be appropriate for areas containing high value assets
(e.g., settlements and cultural sites). Retreat is worth considering
now where coastal population size and density is low, risks are
already high, and the economic, cultural and sociopolitical impacts of
retreat and resettlement are carefully considered and addressed by
at-risk communities and their governing authorities.

remain for poorer and developing regions (4.3.3.4, 4.4.2.2.3). In
cities, advance can offer a way to finance coastal protection through
revenues generated from newly created land (4.4.2.4), but raises
equity concerns with regard to the distribution of costs and access
to the new land (4.4.2.4.6). Where space is available, EbA can
supplement hard protection (4.4.2.3), except in situations where
other human interventions, like infrastructure and pollution, interfere
with EbA, especially for RCP8.5 (Cross-Chapter Box 9). Retreat may
currently be favoured over rebuilding in the aftermath of major
flooding disasters, but in densely populated areas protected by hard
infrastructure, general retreat need not be considered until later in
the century once it is known whether or not SLR will reach the higher
end of the projections (1.1 m or more by 2100; 4.4.2.6).

"Responding to SLR refers to reducing hazards, exposure and
vulnerability of low-lying coastal areas. It can be approached in
fundamentally different ways and five major categories are described
in this chapter (Box 4.3): Protection reduces coastal risk and impacts
by blocking the inland propagation and other effects of mean or
extreme sea levels hazards (e.g., through dikes, seawalls, storm
surge barriers, breakwaters, beach-dune systems, etc.). Advance
creates new land by building seawards (e.g., reclamation of new land
above sea levels or planting vegetation with the specific intention
to support natural accretion of land). Ecosystem-based adaptation
(EbA) provides a combination of the benefits of protect and advance
strategies based on the conservation and restoration of ecosystems
such as reefs and coastal vegetation. Accommodation includes a
diverse set of biophysical and institutional responses to reduce
vulnerability of coastal residents, human activities, ecosystems and
the built environment (e.g., raising buildings, planting salt tolerant
crops, insurance and EWS for ESL events). Retreat reduces exposure
to coastal hazards by moving people, assets and human activities out
of the exposed coastal area.
"	Text
"Each type of response has particular advantages and disadvantages,
and may play a synergistic role in an integrated and sequenced
response to SLR. For example, hard protection needs less space and
its effectiveness is more predictable than for EbA (high confidence;
4.4.2.2.4, 4.4.2.3.4). EbA has advantages of contributing to
conservation goals and providing additional ecosystem services such
as carbon sequestration and improved water quality (4.4.2.2.5). EbA
can become more effective over time, because coastal ecosystems can
migrate inland with rising sea levels, provided this is not restricted
by infrastructure (4.4.2.2.4). In practise, hard, sediment-based and
ecosystem-based protection responses are often combined and there
is high agreement that such hybrid approaches are a promising way
forward (4.4.2.3.1). Advance is an option widely practised when land
is scarce and offers the opportunity to finance adaptation through
land sale revenues, but can also increase exposure and destroy coastal
wetlands and their protective function (4.4.2.4). Accommodation
measures such as flood proofing buildings, flood forecasting, early
warning and emergency planning have high benefit-cost ratios,
which means that implementing them is much cheaper than doing
nothing (4.4.2.5.6). Retreat, and avoidance of development in some
locations, are the only types of responses that eliminate residual
risks, assuming there is sufficiently safe alternative land to retreat to
or develop (4.4.2.6, Cross-Chapter Box 9).

multiple governance levels. Public participation approaches can be

"Sea level changes have been discussed throughout the various
IPCC assessment reports as SLR is a key feature of climate change.
Complex interactions between the oceans and ice sheets only
recently have been recognised as important drivers of processes that
can lead to rapid dynamical changes in the ice sheets. Understanding
of basal melt below the ice shelves, ice calving processes and glacial
hydrological processes was also limited. Projections of future sea
level in the IPCC 4th Assessment Report (AR4; Lemke et al., 2007)
were presented with the caveat that dynamical ice sheet processes
were not accounted for, as our physical understanding of these
processes was too rudimentary and no literature could be assessed
(Bindoff et al., 2007). In ARS (Church et al., 2013), a first attempt
was made to quantify the dynamic contribution of the ice sheets,
although still with modeling based on limited physcis, relying mainly
on an extrapolation of existing observations (Little et al., 2013) and
a single process based case study (Bindschadler et al., 2013). Here
the focus is on sea level changes around coastlines and low-lying
islands, updating the GMSL rise by including a new estimate of the
dynamic contribution of Antarctica. The mechanism driving past and
contemporary sea level changes and episodic extremes of sea level is
explained, and confidence in regional projections of future sea level
over the 21st century and beyond is assessed.

"As a consequence of natural and anthropogenic changes in the
climate system, sea level changes are occurring on temporal and
spatial scales that threaten coastal communities, cities, and low-lying
islands. Sea level in this context means the time average height of
the sea surface, thus eliminating short duration fluctuations like
waves, surges and tides. GMSL rise refers to an increase in the
volume of ocean water caused by warmer water having a lower
density, and by the increase in mass caused by loss of land ice or a
net loss in terrestrial water reservoirs. Spatial variations in volume
changes are related to spatial changes in the climate. In addition,
mass changes due to the redistribution of water on the Earth's
surface and deformation of the lithosphere leads to a change in the
Earth's rotation and gravitational field, producing distinct spatial
patterns in regional sea level change. In addition to the regional
changes associated with contemporary ice and water redistribution,
the solid Earth may cause sea level changes due to tectonics, mantle
dynamics or glacial isostatic adjustment (see Section 4.2.1.5). These
processes cause vertical land motion (VLM) and sea surface height
changes at coastlines. Hence, RSL change is defined as the change in
the difference in elevation between the land and the sea surface at a
specific time and location (Farrell and Clark, 1976). Here, regional sea
level refers to spatial scales of around 100 km, while local sea level
refers to spatial scales smaller than 10 km.

"Changing distributions of water mass between land, ice and ocean

field and rotation, and elastic deformation of the solid Earth. These
processes combine to produce spatially varying patterns of sea level
change (Mitrovica et al., 2001; Mitrovica et al, 2011). For example,
adjacent to an ice sheet losing mass, reduced gravitational attraction
between the ice and nearby ocean causes RSL to fall, despite the rise
in GMSL from the input of melt water to the ocean. The opposite
effect is found far from the ice sheet, where RSL rise can be enhanced
as much as 30% relative to the global average.

"Glaciers outside of the GIS and AIS are important contributors to sea
level change (Figure 4.4). Because of their specific accumulation and
ablation rates, which are often high compared to those of the ice
sheets, they are sensitive indicators of climate change and respond
quickly to changes in climate. Over the past century, glaciers have
added more mass to the ocean than the GIS and AIS combined
(Gregory et al., 2013). However, the mass of glaciers is small by
comparison, equivalent to only 0.32 + 0.08 m mean SLR if only the
fraction of ice above sea level is considered (Farinotti et al., 2019).

leading to sea level fall, but in recent decades, land water depletion

contribute to sea level change (Wada et al. 2017). Changes in
terrestrial reservoirs may also be related to climate variability: in
particular, the El Nifio Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has a strong
impact on precipitation distribution and temporary storage of water

"because of ice mass loss, and partly because of thermal expansion.
Models and observations indicate that over recent decades, more
than 90% of the increase in energy in the climate system has been
stored in the ocean. Hence, thermal expansion provides insight into
climate sensitivity (Church et al., 2013). Findings from sea level
studies and the energy budget are consistent (Otto et al, 2013). As
thermal expansion per degree is dependent on the temperature itself,
heat uptake by a warm region has a larger impact on SLR than heat
uptake by a cold region. This contributes to regional changes in sea
level, which are also caused by the water temperature and salinity
variations (e.g., Lowe and Gregory, 2006; Suzuki and Ishii, 2011;
Bouttes et al., 2014; Saenko et al., 2015). Regional patterns in sea
level change are also modified from the global average by oceanic
and atmospheric (fluid) dynamics (Griffies and Greatbatch, 2012),
including trends in ocean currents, redistribution of temperature and
salinity (sea water density), buoyancy, and atmospheric pressure. An
analysis of these trends in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
Phase 5 (CMIP5) General Circulation Models (GCMs; Yin, 2012)
demonstrates the potential for >15 cm of SLR by 2100 and >30 cm

Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) GCM simulations are not

"Ice sheets gain or lose mass through changes in surface mass
balance (SMB), the sum of accumulation and ablation controlled
by atmospheric processes, the loss of ice to the ocean though
melting of ice shelves, and by calving (breaking off of ice bergs) at
marine-terminating ice fronts (see Chapter 3). Ice shelves, the floating
extensions of grounded ice flowing into the ocean (Figure 4.4) do not
directly contribute to sea level, but they play an important role in
ice sheet dynamics by providing resistance to the seaward flow of
the grounded ice upstream (Fiirst et al., 2016; Reese et al., 2018b).
Ice shelves gain mass through the inflow of ice from the ice sheet,
precipitation, and accretion at the ice-ocean interface. They lose
mass through a combination of calving and by melting from below,
especially where basal ice is in contact with warm water (Paolo et al.,
2015, Khazendar et al., 2016). Calving rates at the terminus of marine
terminating ice fronts are governed by complex ice-mechanical
processes, the internal strength of the ice, and interaction with
ocean waves and tides (Benn et al., 2007; Bassis, 2011; Massom
et al., 2018). Sub-ice shelf melts rates are controlled by ice-ocean
interactions involving the large-scale circulation, more localised
heat and fresh water fluxes, and micro (mm)-scale processes in
the ice-ocean boundary layer (Gayen et al., 2015; Dinniman et al.,
2016; Schodlok et al., 2016). Ice shelves are also impacted by surface
processes. Where surface melt rates are high, ice shelves not only
lose mass, they can collapse (hydrofracture) from flexural stresses
caused by the movement of the meltwater and the deepening of
water-filled crevasses (Banwell et al., 2013; Macayeal and Sergienko,
2013; Kuipers Munneke et al., 2014). These complex ice-ocean
interactions, calving and hydrofracture processes remain difficult to
model, particularly at the scale of ice sheets.

"Superimposed on gradual changes in RSL, as described in the previous
sections, tides, storm surges, waves and other high-frequency
processes (Figure 4.4) can be important. Understanding the localised
impact of such processes requires detailed knowledge of bathymetry,
erosion and sedimentation, as well as a good description of the
temporal variability of the wind fields generating waves and storm
surges. The potential for compounding effects, like storm surge
and high SLR, are of particular concern as they can contribute
significantly to flooding risks and extreme events (Little et al., 2015a).
These processes can be captured by hydrodynamical models (see
Section 4.2.3.4).

"adjustment (GIA) is causing uplift and a lowering of RSL that continues
today. In other locations proximal to the previous ice load, and where
a glacial forebulge once existed, the relaxing forebulge can contribute
to a relative SLR, as currently being experienced along the coastline of
the northeast United States. Water being syphoned to high latitudes
as the peripheral bulges collapse leads to a widespread RSL fall in
equatorial regions, while the overall loading of ocean crust by melt
water can cause uplift of land areas near continental margins, far from
the location of previous ice loading (Mitrovica and Milne, 2003; Milne
and Mitrovica, 2008). Rates of modern VLM associated with these
post-glacial processes are generally on the order of a few mm yr
or less, but can exceed 1 cm yr in some places. Because these
gravity, rotation, and deformation (GRD) processes control spatial
patterns of SLR from melting land ice, they need to be accounted for
in regional-to-local sea level assessments. GRD processes are also
important for marine-based ice sheets themselves, because they
locally reduce RSL at retreating grounding lines which can slow and
reduce retreat (Gomez et al., 2015; see 4.3.3.1.2 and Cross-chapter
Box 8 in Chapter 3; Larour et al., 2019).

sea level are sensitive to the assumed ice history before and after the

"Greenland and Antarctic climate change on these time scales is
influenced by inter-hemispheric differences in polar amplification
(Stap et al., 2018), changes in Earth’s orbit, and long-term climate
system processes. This complicates relationships between global
mean temperature and ice sheet response. On Greenland, the
magnitude of LIG summer warming and changes in ice sheet volume
continue to be contested. Extreme summer warming of 6°C or more,
reconstructed from ice cores (Dahl-Jensen et al., 2013; Landais et al.,
2016; Yau et al., 2016) and lake archives (McFarlin et al., 2018)
is in apparent conflict with a persistent, spatially extensive GIS
reconstructed from ice cores and radar imaging (Dahl-Jensen et al.,
2013). Maximum retreat of the GIS during the LIG varies widely
among modelling studies, ranging from ~1 m to ~6 m (Helsen et al.,
2013; Quiquet et al., 2013; Dutton et al, 2015a; Goelzer et al., 2016;
Yau et al., 2016); however, the models consistently indicate a small
Greenland contribution to GMSL early in the interglacial, implying
Antarctica was the dominant contributor to the early interglacial
highstand of 6 + 1.5 m, beginning around 129 ka (Dutton et al.,
2015b). An early LIG loss of Antarctic ice is consistent with recent
ice sheet modelling (DeConto and Pollard, 2016; Goelzer et al.,
2016). Due to its bedrock configuration and susceptibility to marine
ice sheet instabilities (Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3), the WAIS
would have been especially vulnerable to subsurface ocean warming
during the LIG (Sutter et al., 2016). However, most evidence of WAIS
retreat during the LIG remains indirect (Steig et al., 2015) and firm
geological evidence has yet to be uncovered. A recent analysis of East
Antarctic sediments provides evidence of some ice retreat in Wilkes
subglacial basin during the LIG (Wilson and Forsyth, 2018), but the
volume of ice loss is not quantified.

"Most estimates of peak GMSL during the mPWP range between 6
and 30 m higher than today (Miller et al., 2012; Rovere et al., 2014;
Dutton et al., 2015a) but with deep uncertainty (Cross-Chapter Box 5
in Chapter 1) and few constraints on the high end of the range. The
large uncertainty is contributed by uncertain GIA corrections applied
to palaeo shoreline indicators (Raymo et al., 2011; Rovere et al., 2014),
dynamic topography, the vertical land surface motion associated
with Earth's mantle flow (Rowley et al., 2013), and possible biases
in geochemical records of ice volume derived from marine sediments
(Raymo et al., 2018). Estimates of GMSL >10 m higher than today
require a meltwater contribution from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet in
addition to the GIS and West Antarctic Ice Sheets (WAIS; Miller et al.,
2012; Dutton et al., 2015a). Pliocene modelling studies appearing
since AR5 (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2013) demonstrate the potential
for substantial retreat of East Antarctic ice into deep submarine
basins (Austermann and Mitrovica, 2015; Pollard et al., 2015; Aitken
et al., 2016; DeConto and Pollard, 2016; Gasson et al., 2016; Golledge
et al, 2019), as does emerging geological evidence from marine
sediment cores recovered from the East Antarctic margin (Cook
et al., 2013; Patterson et al., 2014; Bertram et al., 2018). However,
the range of maximum Pliocene GMSL contributions from Antarctic
modelling (Austermann and Mitrovica, 2015; Pollard et al., 2015;
Yamane et al., 2015; DeConto and Pollard, 2016; Gasson et al., 2016)
remains large (5.4-17.8 m), providing little additional constraint on
the geological estimates. Land surface exposure measurements on
sediment sourced from East Antarctica (Shakun et al., 2018) suggests
Pliocene ice loss was limited to marine-based ice, where the bedrock
is below sea level and possibly prone to marine ice sheet instabilities
(Cross-Chapter box 8 in Chapter 3). The total potential contribution
to GMSL rise from marine-based ice in Antarctica is ~22.5 m (Fretwell
et al., 2013). Combined with the complete loss of the GIS, this could
conceivably produce ~30 m of GMSL rise. However, this would
require maximum retreat of GIS and AIS to be synchronous, which is
not probable due to orbitally paced, inter-hemispheric asymmetries
in Greenland and Antarctic climate (de Boer et al., 2017). As such,
25 m is found to be a reasonable upper bound on GMSL during the
mPWP, but with low confidence.

"The number of tide gauges has increased over time from only a few in
northern Europe in the 18th century to more than 2000 today along
the world’s coastlines. Because of their location and limited number,
tide gauges sample the ocean sparsely and non-uniformly with a bias
towards the Northern Hemisphere. Most tide gauge records are short
and have significant gaps. In addition, tide gauges are anchored
on land and are affected by the vertical motion of Earth's crust
caused by both natural processes (e.g., GIA, tectonics and sediment
compaction; Woppelmann and Marcos, 2016; Pfeffer et al., 2017) and
anthropogenic activities (e.g., groundwater depletion, dam building
"	Text
"or settling of landfill in urban areas; Raucoules et al., 2013; Pfeffer
et al., 2017). When estimating the GMSL due to the ocean thermal
expansion and land ice melt, tide gauges must be corrected for this
VLM, where VLM = GIA + anthropogenic subsidence + (tectonics,
natural subsidence). This is possible with stations of the Global
Positioning System (GPS) network when they are co-located with
tide gauges (Santamaria-Gomez et al., 2017; Kleinherenbrink et al.,
2018). However, this approach provides information on the VLM over
the past two to three decades and has limited value over longer time
scales for places where the VLM has varied significantly through the
last century (Riva et al., 2017).
"	Text
"Observational estimates of the sea level variations over past
millennia rely essentially on proxy-based regional relative sea
level reconstructions corrected for GIA. Since AR5, the increasing
availability of regional proxy-based reconstructions enables the
estimation of GMSL change over the last ~3 kyr. The first statistical
integration of the available reconstructions shows that the GMSL
experienced variations of +9 [+7 to +11] cm (5-95% uncertainty
range; Kopp et al., 2016) over the 2400 years preceding the 20th
century (medium confidence). This is more tightly bound than the AR5
assessment which indicated a variability in GMSL that was <+25 cm
over the same period. This progress since AR5 confirms that it is
virtually certain that the mean rate of GMSL has increased during the
last two centuries from relatively low rates of change during the late
Holocene (order tenths of mm yr) to modern rates (order mm yr"";
Woodruff et al., 2013).

"Over the last two centuries, sea level observations have mostly
relied on tide gauge measurements. These records, beginning around
1700 in some locations (Holgate et al., 2012; PSMSL, 2019), provide
insight into historic sea level trends. Since 1992, the emergence of
precise satellite altimetry has advanced our knowledge on GMSL and
regional sea level changes considerably through a combination of
near global ocean coverage and high spatial resolution. It has also
enabled more detailed monitoring of land ice loss. Since 2002, high
precision gravity measurements provided by the Gravity Recovery
and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On missions
show the loss of land ice in Greenland and Antarctica, and confirm
independent assessments of ice sheet mass changes based on
satellite altimetry (Shepherd et al., 2012; The Imbie team, 2018)
and InSAR measurements combined with ice sheet SMB estimates
(Noél et al., 2018; Rignot et al., 2019). Since 2006, when the array
of Argo profiling floats reached near-global coverage, it has been
possible to get an accurate estimate of the ocean thermal expansion
(down to 2000 m depth) and test the closure of the sea level
budget. The combined analysis of the different observing systems
that are available has improved significantly the understanding of
the magnitude and relative contributions of the different processes
causing sea level change. In particular, important progress has been
achieved since AR5 on estimating and understanding the increasing
contribution of the ice sheets to SLR.

"ARS assessed the different strategies to estimate the 20th century
GMSL changes. These strategies only accounted for the inhomogeneous
space and time coverage of tide gauge data and for the VLM induced
by GIA (Figure 4.5). Since ARS two new approaches have been
developed. The first one uses a Kalman smoother which combines tide
gauge records with the spatial patterns associated with ocean dynamic
change, change in land ice and GIA. It enables accounting for the
inhomogeneous distribution of tide gauges and the VLM associated
with both GIA and current land ice loss (Hay et al., 2015; Figure 4.5).
The second approach uses ad hoc corrections to tide gauge records
with an additional spatial pattern associated with changes in terrestrial
water storage to account for the inhomogeneous distribution in tide
gauges. It also accounts for the total VLM (Dangendorf et al., 2017;
Figure 4.5). Both methods yield significantly lower GMSL changes
over the period 1950-1970 than previous estimates, leading to
long-term trends since 1900 that are smaller than previous estimates
by 0.4 mm yr"" (Figure 4.5). Different arguments including biases in
the tide gauge datasets (Hamlington and Thompson, 2015), biases in
the averaging technique and absence of VLM correction (Dangendorf
et al., 2017), or in the spatial patterns associated with the sea level
contributions (Hamlington et al. 2018) have been proposed to
explain these smaller GMSL rates. There is no agreement yet on which
is the primary reason for the differences and it is not clear whether
all the reasons invoked can actually explain all the differences
across reconstructions. As there is no clear evidence to discard any
reconstruction, this assessment considers the ensemble of AR5 sea
level reconstructions augmented by the two recent reconstructions
from Hay et al. (2015) and Dangendorf et al. (2017) to evaluate the
GMSL changes over the 20th century. On this basis, it is estimated
that it is very likely that the long-term trend in GMSL estimated from
tide gauge records is 1.5 (1.1-1.9) mm yr! between 1902 and 2010
for a total SLR of 0.16 (0.12—-0.21) m (see also Table 4.1) over this
period. This estimate is consistent with the AR5 assessment (but with
an increased uncertainty range) and confirms that it is virtually certain
that GMSL rates over the 20th century are several times as large as
GMSL rates during the late Holocene (see 4.2.2.1). Over the 20th
century the GMSL record also shows an acceleration (high confidence)
as now four out of five reconstructions extending back to at least
1902 show a robust acceleration (Jevrejeva et al., 2008; Church and
White, 2011; Ray and Douglas, 2011; Haigh et al., 2014b; Hay et al.,
2015; Watson, 2016; Dangendorf et al, 2017). The estimates of the
acceleration ranges between -0.002—0.019 mm yr over 1902-2010
are consistent with ARS.

"Historically, however, observational gaps exist and some ocean
regions remain under-sampled to date (Sections 1.8.1.1 and
5.2.2.2.2; Figure 1.3; Appendix 1.A, Figure 1.1). Other factors also
introduce uncertainty in estimates of thermal expansion like changes
in instrumentation, systematic instrumental errors, changes in
the quality control of the data and the mapping method used to
produce regular grids (Section 5.2.2.2.2; Palmer et al., 2010). In the
upper 700 m, the largest sources of uncertainty for estimates of
global mean thermal expansion from 1970 to 2004 are the choice
of mapping methods (Boyer et al., 2016), followed by the choice
of bias correction for the bathythermographic observations (Cheng
et al., 2016; Section 5.2.2.2.2). From 2006 onwards, the uncertainty
is considerably reduced (Roemmich et al., 2015; von Schuckmann

its targeted near-global (up to +60°latitude) coverage for the upper

"Since ARS, in a community effort, the (WCRP Global Sea Level Budget
Group, 2018) revisited the global mean thermal expansion estimates
based on observations only. On the basis of a full-depth 13-member
ensemble of global mean thermal expansion time series developed
with the latest data and corrections available, they estimated that
the global thermal expansion was 1.40 (1.08-1.72) mm yr for
2006-2015, 1.36 (0.96-1.76) mm yr“ for 1993-2015 (see Table 4.1).
While the relative contribution of the upper 300 m did not change
(~70%) between 2006-2015 and 1993-2015, the 700-2000 m
contribution increased around 10% over the Argo decade (2006-
2015), when observations for that depth interval soared (Figure 1.3;
Appendix 1.A, Figure 1.1). This suggests that observed changes for
700-2000 m may have been underestimated for 1993-2005. Before
1993, estimates are based on a smaller ensemble of 4 datasets in
which no thermal expansion is assumed below 2000 m because of
lack of data (see Section 5.2.2.2.2 for more details). This ensemble
shows a thermal expansion linear rate of 0.89 (0.84-0.94) mm yr“

"High precision satellite altimetry started in October 1992 with the
launch of the TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason series of spacecraft. Since
then, 11 satellite altimeters have been launched providing nearly
global sea level measurements (up to +82°latitude) over more
than 25 years. Six groups (AVISO/CNES, SL_cci/ESA, University of

ARS, several studies using two independent approaches based on
tide gauge records (Watson et al., 2015) and the sea level budget
closure (Chen et al, 2017; Dieng et al, 2017) identified a drift of
1.5 (0.4-3.4) mm yr"" in TOPEX A from January 1993 to February
1999. Accounting for this drift leads to a revised GMSL rate from
satellite altimetry of 3.16 (2.79-3.53) for 1993-2015 (WCRP
Global Sea Level Budget Group, 2018; see Table 4.1) compared to
3.3 mm yr (2.7-3.9) for 1993-2010 in AR5. Compared to ARS,
the revised satellite altimetry GMSL estimates now show with high
confidence an acceleration of 0.084 (0.059-0.090) mm yr over
1993-2015 (5-95% uncertainty range; Watson et al., 2015; Nerem
et al., 2018). This acceleration is due to an increase in Greenland
mass loss since the 2000s (Chen et al., 2017; Dieng et al., 2017) and
a slight increase in all other contributions probably partly due to
the recovery from the Pinatubo volcanic eruption in 1991 (Fasullo
et al, 2016) and partly due to increased GHG concentrations
eg., (Slangen et al, 2016; high confidence). The current sea level
rise is 3.6 + 0.3 mm yr over 2006-2015 (90% confidence level).
This is the highest rate measured by satellite altimetry (Ablain et al.,
2019; medium confidence). Before the satellite altimetry era, the
highest rate of sea level rise recorded was reached during the period
1935-1944. It amounted 2.5 + 0.7 mm yr"" (estimate at the 90%
confidence level from sea level reconstructions; Church and White,
2011; Ray and Douglas, 2011; Jevrejeva et al., 2008; Hay et al., 2015;
Dangendorf et al., 2017). This is expected to be smaller than the
current rate of sea level rise, making the current sea level rise the
highest on instrumental record (medium confidence).

The number is calculated as the mean between the estimate from a reconstruction of glacier mass balance based on glacier length (update of Leclercq et al. (2011)) and tk
estimate from a mass balance model forced with atmospheric observations (Marzeion et al., 2015). The uncertainty is assumed to be a gaussian with a standard deviatic
of half the difference between the two estimates.

The number is calculated as the sum of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) contribution from Kjeldsen et al. (2015) and the peripheral glaciers’ contribution. The peripher
glaciers’ contribution and the associated uncertainty are computed from a mass balance model forced with atmospheric observations (Marzeion et al., 2015). The tot
uncertainty is computed assuming that both uncertainties from the GIS contribution and from the peripheral glaciers’ contribution are independent.

Sea level reconstructions that end before 2015 have been extended to 2015 with the satellite altimetry record from Legeais et al. (2018). The uncertainty is derived from th

The mean estimate is from the satellite altimetry estimate in WCRP Global Sea Level Budget Group (2018) corrected for GIA and for the elastic response of the ocean cru

Land water storage is estimated from Wada et al. (2016) and ice discharge is deduced from Shepherd et al. (2012). The ice discharge contribution is assumed to be ze

"The ocean mass changes correspond to the sum of land ice and
terrestrial water storage changes. Since 2002, the GRACE and
GRACE follow-on missions provide direct estimates of the ocean
mass changes and thus they provide an independent estimate of
the sum of land ice and terrestrial water storage contributions to
sea level. Since AR5, GRACE-based estimates of the ocean mass
rates are increasingly consistent (WCRP Global Sea Level Budget
Group, 2018) because of the extended length of GRACE missions’
observations (over 15 years), the improved understanding of data
and methods for addressing GRACE limitations (e.g., noise filtering,
leakage correction and low-degree spherical harmonics estimates),
and the improved knowledge of geophysical corrections applied
to GRACE data (e.g., GIA). The most recent estimates (Dieng et al.,
2015b; Reager et al., 2016; Rietbroek et al., 2016; Chambers et al.,
2017; Blazquez et al., 2018; Uebbing et al., 2019) report a global
ocean mass increase of 1.7 (1.4-2.0) mm yr over 2003-2015 (see
also Table 4.1). The uncertainty arises essentially from differences
in the inversion method to compute the ocean mass (Chen et al.,
2013; Jensen et al., 2013; Johnson and Chambers, 2013; Rietbroek
et al., 2016), uncertainties in the geocentre motion and uncertainty
in the GIA correction (Blazquez et al., 2018; Uebbing et al., 2019). The
consistency between estimates of the global mean ocean mass on a
monthly time scale has also increased since ARS.

"Frequent observations of ice sheet mass changes have only been
available since the advent of space observations (see Section 3.3.1).
In the pre-satellite era, mass balance was geodetically reconstructed
only for the GIS (Kjeldsen et al., 2015). These geodetic reconstructions
empirically constrain the contribution of the GIS to SLR between
1900 and 1983 to 17.2 (10.7—-23.2; Kjeldsen et al., 2015). During the
satellite era, three approaches have been developed to estimate ice
sheet mass balance: 1) Mass loss is estimated by direct measurements
of ice sheet height changes with satellite laser or radar altimetry in
combination with climatological/glaciological models for firn density
and compaction, 2) the input-output method combines measurements
of ice flow velocities estimated from satellite (synthetic aperture
radar or optical imagery) across key outlets with estimates of net
surface balance derived from ice thickness data, 3) space gravimetry
data yields direct estimate of the mass changes by inversion of the
anomalies in the gravity field (see Section 3.3.1 for more details). AR5
concluded that the three space-based methods give consistent results.
They agree in showing that the rate of SLR due to the GIS and Als’
contributions has increased since the early 1990s. Since ARS, up-to-
date observations confirm this statement with increased confidence
for both ice sheets (Rignot et al., 2019; see Section 3.3.1). The
assessment of the literature since AR5 made in Section 3.3.1 shows
that the contribution from Greenland to SLR over 2012-2016 (0.68
(0.64-0.72) mm yr) was similar to the contribution over 2002-2011
(0.73 (0.67-0.79) mmyr) andextremely likely greater than over 1992-
2001 (0.02 (0.21-0.25) mm yr’). The contribution from Antarctica over
2012-2016 (0.55 (0.48-0.62) mm yr) was extremely likely greater
than over the 2002-2011 period (0.23 (0.16-0.30) mm yr"") and
likely greater than over the period 1992-2001 (0.14 (0.12-0.16); see

to satellite altimetry and when the Argo network reaches a near-global
coverage). The budget of GMSL rise is also assessed with sea level
contributions simulated by climate models over the same periods
(Table 4.1, Figure 4.5). The periods 1993-2015 and 2006-2015 are
only 23 and 10 years long respectively, short enough so that they can
be affected by internal climate variability. Therefore, it is not expected
that observations over these periods will be precisely reproduced by
climate model historical experiments. For the contribution from land
water storage, the estimated effect of direct human intervention
was used, neglecting climate-related variations until 2002 (Ngo-Duc
et al., 2005). From 2002 to 2015, total land water storage estimated
with GRACE was used. In general, historical simulations of climate
models end in 2005. Historical simulations were extended here to
2015 using the RCP8.5 scenario. This choice of RCP scenario is not
critical for the simulated sea level, as the different scenarios only
start to diverge significantly after the year 2030 (Church et al., 2013).

"For 1993-2015 and 2006-2015, the observed GMSL rise is consistent
within uncertainties with the sum of the estimated observed
contributions (Table 4.1). Over the period 1993-2015 the two largest
terms are the ocean thermal expansion (accounting for 43% of the
observed GMSL rise) and the glacier mass loss (accounting for a further
20%). Compared to ARS, the extended observations corrected for the
TOPEX-A drift (see Section 4.2.2.1.2) allow us now to identify an
acceleration in the observed SLR over 1993-2015 and to attribute this
acceleration mainly to Greenland ice loss along with an acceleration in
Antarctic ice loss (Velicogna et al., 2014; Harig and Simons, 2015; Chen
etal., 2017; Dieng et al., 2017; Yiet al., 2017; see also Sections 4.2.2.2.2,
4.2.2.3.4, 3.3.1). Since 2006, land ice, collectively from glaciers and
the ice sheets has become the most important contributor to GMSL
rise over the thermal expansion with mountain glaciers contributing
20% and ice sheets 33% (see Table 4.1). Over the periods 1993-2015,
the sum of the observed sea level contributions is consistent with the
total observed sea level within uncertainties at monthly-scales (not
shown, e.g., Dieng et al., 2017). This is also true for the period 2006—
2015, when uncertainties are significantly smaller. This agreement
at monthly time scales represents a significant advance since the
ARS in physical understanding of the causes of past GMSL change.
It provides an improved basis for the evaluation of models. Given
these elements there is high confidence that the current observing
system is capable of resolving decadal to multidecadal changes
in GMSL and its components (with an uncertainty of <0.7 mm yr!
at decadal and longer time scales, see Table 4.1 and for example,
WCRP Global Sea Level Budget Group, 2018). However, despite this
advance since AR5 there are still no comprehensive observations of
ocean thermal expansion below 2000 m, in regions covered by sea ice
and in marginal seas. The understanding of glacier mass loss can be
improved at regional scale and the understanding of the land water
storage contribution is still limited. Thus, for smaller changes in sea
level of the order of a few tenths of a mm yr at decadal time scales
and shorter time scales there is medium confidence in the capability of
the current observing system to resolve them (e.g., WCRP Global Sea
Level Budget Group, 2018).

"Water is stored on land not only in the form of ice but snow, surface
water, soil moisture and groundwater. Temporal changes in land
water storage, defined as all forms of water stored on land excluding
land ice, contribute to observed changes in ocean mass and thus sea
level on annual to centennial time scales (Doll et al., 2016; Reager
et al, 2016; Hamlington et al., 2017; Wada et al., 2017). They are
caused by both climate variability and direct human interventions,
at the multi-decadal to centennial time scales. Over the past century,
the main cause for land water storage changes are the groundwater
depletion and impoundment of water behind dams in reservoirs
(Déll et al., 2016; Wada et al., 2016). While the rate of groundwater
depletion and thus its contribution to SLR increased during the 20th
century and up to today (Wada et al., 2016), its effect on sea level
was more than balanced by the increase in land water storage due to
dam construction between 1950 and 2000 (Wada et al., 2016). Since
about 2000, based on hydrological models, the combined effect of
both processes is a positive contribution to SLR (Wada et al., 2016).
Decreased water storage in lakes, wetlands and soils due to human
activities are less important for ocean mass changes (Wada et al.,
2016). Overall, the integrated effects of the direct human intervention
on land hydrology have reduced land water storage during the last
decade, increasing the rate of SLR by 0.15-0.24 mm yr"" (Wada
et al., 2016; Wada et al., 2017; Scanlon et al., 2018; WCRP Global
Sea Level Budget Group, 2018). Over periods of a few decades,
land water storage was affected significantly by climate variability
(Dieng et al, 2015a; Reager et al, 2016; Dieng et al., 2017). Net
land water storage change driven by both climate and direct human
interventions can be determined based on GRACE observations and
global hydrological modelling. They indicate different estimates of
the rate of SLR. Over the period 2002-2014 GRACE-based estimates
of the net land water storage (i.e., not including glaciers) show a
negative contribution to sea level (e.g., Scanlon et al., 2018) resulting
in the negative value after 2006 in Table 1while hydrological models
determined a slightly positive one. The reasons for this difference
between estimates are not elucidated. There is scientific consensus
that uncertainties of both net land water storage contribution to sea
level and its individual contributions remain high (WCRP Global Sea
Level Budget Group, 2018). The differences in estimates and the lack
of multiple consistent studies give /ow confidence in the net land
water storage contribution to current SLR.

of the ocean represents 43% of the observed GMSL rise while the
glaciers’ contribution represents 22% (see Table 4.1). This result
indicates a slightly smaller contribution from glaciers than reported
by ARS. If the GIS contribution and the Antarctic SMB is added, then
the sum of the contributors to sea level is in agreement with the
low end observed SLR estimates over 1970-2015 (Frederikse et al.,

the effect of dynamic mass redistribution becomes important. At

regional changes are essentially due to changing winds, air-sea heat

of melting ice into the ocean, which alters the ocean circulation
(Stammer et al., 2013; Forget and Ponte, 2015; Meyssignac et al.,

increase in air temperatures in and around Greenland over the period
1900-1940, which lead to increased melt in Greenland (Bjork et al.,
2012; Fettweis et al., 2017) and surrounding glaciers in the first half
of the 20th century. This increase in air temperature over 1900-1940
is not reproduced by climate models (Slangen et al., 2017b). It may
be because this increase in air temperature was due to internal
climate variability on temporal and spatial scales that cannot be
precisely reproduced by climate models. It may also be due to a bias
in atmospheric circulation in climate models (Fettweis et al., 2017),
or an issue with the spatial pattern of the historical aerosol forcing.

and observations of the global thermal expansion, glacier mass loss

starting after 1970. However, for periods prior to 1970, significant
discrepancies between climate models and observations arise
from the inability of climate models to reproduce some observed
regional changes in glacier and GIS SMB around the southern tip of
Greenland. It is not clear whether this bias in climate models is due to
the internal variability of the climate system or deficiencies in climate
models. For this reason, there is still medium confidence in the ability
of climate models to simulate past and future changes in glaciers

"As for GMSL, net regional sea level changes can be estimated from
a combination of the various contributions to sea level change. The
contributions from dynamic sea level, atmospheric loading, glacier
mass changes and ice sheet SMB can be derived from CMIP5 climate
model outputs either directly or through downscaling techniques
(Perrette et al., 2013; Kopp et al., 2014; Slangen et al., 2014a;
Bilbao et al., 2015; Carson et al., 2016; Meyssignac et al., 2017a).
The contributions from groundwater depletion, reservoir storage
and dynamic ice sheet mass changes are not simulated by coupled
climate models over the 20th century and have to be estimated
from observations. The sum of all contributions, including the GIA
contribution, provides a modelled estimate of the 20th century net
regional sea level changes that can be compared with observations
from satellite altimetry and tide-gauge records (see Figure 4.6).

2014). Several studies suggested that in addition to the PDO signal,
warming of the tropical Indian and Atlantic Oceans enhanced surface
easterly trade winds and thus also contributes to the intensified SLR
in the western tropical Pacific (England et al., 2014; Hamlington et al.,
2014; McGregor et al., 2014).

"Over the Atlantic, the regional sea level variability at interannual to
multi-decadal time scales, is generated by surface wind anomalies
and heat fluxes associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO;
Han et al., 2017) and also by ocean heat transport due to changes
in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC; McCarthy
et al., 2015). Both mechanisms are not independent as heat fluxes
and wind stress anomalies associated with NAO can induce changes
in the AMOC (Schloesser et al., 2014; Yeager and Danabasoglu,
2014). In the Southern Ocean, the sea level variability is dominated
by the SAM influence in particular in the Indian and Pacific sectors.
The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) influence becomes weaker
equator-wards in these sectors while the influence of PDO, ENSO and
IOD increases (Frankcombe et al., 2015). In the southern ocean, the
Zonal asymmetry in westerly winds associated to the SAM, generates
convergent and divergent transport in the Antarctic Circumpolar
Current which may have contributed to the regional asymmetry of
decadal sea level variations during most of the twentieth century
(Thompson and Mitchum, 2014).

century regional sea level changes due to GIA, thermal expansion,

ARS. But some doubts remain regarding the ability of climate models
to reproduce local variations such as the glaciers and the Greenland
SMB contributions to sea level in the region around the southern
tip of Greenland (Slangen et al., 2017b) or such as the thermal
expansion in some eddy active regions (Sérazin et al., 2016). Because
of these doubts there is still medium confidence in climate models
to project future regional sea level changes associated with thermal

"In terms of interannual to multi-decadal variability, there is a
general agreement between the simulated regional sea level and
tide gauge records, over the period 1900-2015 (see inset figures in
Figure 4.6). The relatively large, short-term oscillations in observed
sea level (black lines in insets in Figure 4.6), which are due to the
natural internal climate variability, are included in general within the
modelled internal variability of the climate system represented by
the blue shaded area (5-95% uncertainty). But, as for GMSL, climate
models tend to systematically underestimate the observed sea level
trends from tide gauge records, particularly in the first half of the
20th century. This underestimation is explained by a bias identified in
modelled Greenland SMB, and glacier ice loss around Greenland in the
early 20th century (see Section 4.2.2.2.6; Slangen et al., 2017b). The
correction of this bias improves the agreement between the spatial
variability in sea level trends from observations and from climate
models (see Figure 4.6). Climate models indicate that the spatial
variability in sea level trends observed by tide-gauge records over the
20th century is dominated by the GIA contribution and the thermal

Nicholls, 2015).A fraction of these subsidence rates might be caused by
long-term processes of increased sediment loading during the Holocene
resulting from changes in the monsoon system (Karpytchev et al., 2018).
Subsidence rates are expected to decrease in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-

"In deltas, the local sea level can be dominated by anthropogenic
subsidence more than by the processes outlined above. It is often
a primary driver of elevated local SLR and increased flood hazards
in those regions. This is particularly true for deltaic systems, where
fertile soils, low-relief topography, freshwater access, and strategic
ports have encouraged the development of many of the world’s
most densely populated coastlines and urban centres. For example,
globally, one in fourteen humans resides in mid-to-low latitude
deltas (Day et al., 2016). Although in these areas RSL is dominated
by anthropogenic subsidence, climate effects need to be included for
estimating risks associated with RSL (Syvitski et al., 2009).

waters have increased twice as much as one would expect from

cycle, yielding a 30% increase in risk of flooding. Such effects are
likely to be highly dependent on the local conditions. For example,
using WAVEWATCH III, TOPEX/Poseidon altimetry tide model data

"Deltas are formed by the accumulation of unconsolidated river born
sediments and porous organic material, both of which are particularly
prone to compaction. It is the compaction which causes a drop in
land elevation that increases the rate of local SLR above what would
be observed along a static coastline or one where only climatological
forced processes control the RSL. Under stable deltaic conditions,
the accumulation of fluvially-sourced surficial sediment and organic
matter offsets this natural subsidence (Syvitski and Saito, 2007);
however, in many cases this natural process of delta construction has
been disturbed by reductions in fluvial sediment supply via upstream
dams and fluvial channelisation (Vordsmarty et al., 2003; Syvitski
and Saito, 2007; Syvitski et al, 2009; Luo et al., 2017). Further,
the extraction of fluids and gas that fill the pore space of deltaic
sediments and provide support for overlying material has significantly
increased the rate of compaction and resultant anthropogenic
subsidence along many populated deltas (Higgins, 2016). In addition,
Nicholls (2011) pointed to anthropogenic subsidence by the weight
of buildings in megacities in South-East Asia.

"Since the local coastal sea level (scale ~10 km) is affected by global,
regional (scale ~100 km) and coastal scale features and processes like
anthropogenic subsidence, it may differ substantially from the regional
sea level. At the coast, the sea level change is additionally affected
by wave run up, tidal level, wind forcing, sea level pressure (SLP), the
dominant modes of climate variability, seasonal climatic periodicities,
mesoscale eddies, changes in river flow, as well as anthropogenic
subsidence (see also Box 4.1). These local contributions, combined
with sea level events generated by storm surges and tides result in
anomalous conditions (ESL) which last for a short time in contrast
to the gradual increase over time from for instance ice mass loss.
Flood risk due to ESL is exacerbated due to its interaction with RSL
and hence physical vulnerability assessments combine uncertainties
around ESL and RSL, both in terms of contemporary assessments and
future projections (Little et al., 2015b; Vousdoukas, 2016; Vousdoukas
et al., 2016; Wahl et al., 2017). Changes in mean sea level have been
dealt with in previous sections (e.g., Section 4.2.2.2.6). Here the
focus is on some of the components of ESL that have been assessed
in combination with changes in RSL. Church et al. (2013) concluded
that change in sea level extremes is very likely to be caused by a
RSL increase, and that storminess and surges will contribute towards
these extremes; however, it was noted that there was /ow confidence
in region-specific projections as there was only a limited number of
studies with a poor geographical coverage available.

"The GIS is currently losing mass at roughly twice the pace of the
AIS (see Chapter 3 and Table 4.1). About 60% of the mass loss
between 1991 and 2015 has been attributed to increasingly negative
SMB from surface melt and runoff on the lower elevations of the
ice sheet margin. Ice dynamical changes and increased discharge
of marine-terminating glaciers account for the remaining 40% of
mass loss (Csatho et al., 2014; Enderlin, 2014; van den Broeke et al.,
2016). The ability of firn on Greenland to retain meltwater until it
tefreezes has diminished markedly since the late 1990s, especially
in lower elevations and on peripheral ice caps (Noél et al., 2017).
Patterns of surface melt on Greenland are highly dependent on
regional atmospheric patterns (Bevis et al., 2019), adding uncertainty
to future projections of SMB. Melt-albedo feedbacks associated with
darkening of the ice surface from ponded water, changes in snow and
firn properties, and accumulation of impurities are also important,
because they can strongly enhance surface melt (Tedesco et al., 2016;
Ryan et al., 2018; Trusel et al., 2018; Ryan et al., 2019). These processes
are not fully captured by most Greenland-scale models which is an
important deficiency, because surface processes tend to dominate
uncertainty in future GIS model projections (e.g., Edwards et al.,
2014; Aschwanden et al., 2019). Increases in meltwater and changes
in the basal hydrologic regime, once thought to have a possible
destabilising effect on the ice sheet (Zwally et al., 2002), have been
linked with recent reductions in ice velocity in western Greenland. On
decadal time scales the effect of meltwater on ice dynamics are now
assessed to be small (van de Wal et al., 2015; Flowers, 2018), which
is supported by ice sheet model experiments (Shannon et al., 2013).

"Coupled climate models can be applied on century time scales, to
provide estimates of the steric (temperature and salinity effects
on sea water density) and ocean dynamical (ocean circulation)
components of sea level change, both globally and regionally.
However, the glacier and ice sheet component are calculated off-line
based on temperature and precipitation changes. In the AR5 report,
changes in the SMB of glaciers and ice sheet were calculated
from the global surface air temperature. In addition, GCMs also
resolve climate variability related to changes in precipitation and
evaporation. These changes are used to calculate short duration sea
level changes (Cazenave and Cozannet, 2014; Hamlington et al.,
2017). With various degrees of success those models capture ENSO,
PDO and other modes of variability (e.g., Yin et al., 2009; Zhang
and Church, 2012), which affect sea level through redistributions
of energy and salt in the ocean on slightly longer time scales.
Off-line temperature and precipitation fields can be dynamically or
statistically downscaled to match the high spatial resolution required
for ice sheets and glaciers, but serious limitations remain. This
deficiency limits adequate representation of potentially important
feedbacks between changes in ice sheet geometry and climate, for
example through fresh water and iceberg production that impact on
ocean circulation and sea ice, which can have global consequences
(Lenaerts et al., 2016; Donat-Magnin et al., 2017). Another limitation
is the lack of coupling with the solid Earth which controls the ice
sheet evolution (Whitehouse et al., 2019). Dynamics of the interaction
of ice streams with bedrock and till at the ice base remain difficult
to model due to lack of direct observations. Nevertheless, several
new ice sheet models have been generated over the last few years,
particularly for Antarctica (Section 4.2.3.1) focusing on the dynamic
contribution of the ice sheet to sea level change, which remains the
key uncertainty in future projections (Church et al., 2013), particularly

work by coupling the ice models with regional climate models and
using multiple climate and ice sheet models within single studies
(Edwards et al., 2014). Recent modelling studies use higher-order
representations of ice flow (Fiirst et al., 2015), include more explicit
representations of ice sheet processes including subglacial hydrology
(Calov et al., 2018), run the models at higher resolution and with
updated boundary conditions (Aschwanden et al., 2019), and account
for two-way coupling between the ice sheet and the global ocean

as emphasised by Edwards et al. (2014). It was found that central
estimates and ranges for RCP8.5 simulated by Fiirst et al. (2015), Calov
et al. (2018), and Golledge et al. (2019) are in reasonable agreement
with previous multi-model results (Bindschadler et al., 2013) and
the assessment of ARS (Church et al., 2013), which reported a likely
RCP8.5 range of Greenland’s contribution to GMSL between 7-21 cm
by 2100 (Table 4.2.). The GIS simulations provided by Vizcaino et al.
(2015), using a relatively course-resolution ice model (10 km) with
SMB forcing provided by a single GCM, estimate much less ice loss
than other recent studies. Their GMSL projections (Vizcaino et al.,
2015) also fall below the /ikely range of AR5 estimates. In contrast,
the study by Aschwanden et al. (2019) shows a significantly higher
contribution to GMSL than the other studies, especially under RCP8.5
and beyond 2100 (see 4.2.3.5). This may be due to their SMB forcing,
which is based on spatially uniform warming derived from future
CMIP5 GCM climatologies averaged over the entire Greenland region.
As noted by earlier work (e.g., Van de Wal and Wild, 2001; Gregory
and Huybrechts, 2006), this approach can overestimate melt rates
in the ablation zone, which could account for their higher projected
ice loss. It is noted that the process-based estimates of future GMSL
rise from Greenland found in Aschwanden et al. (2019) are closest
to those from an updated, structured judgement of glaciological
and modelling experts (Bamber et al., 2019). Calculations from the
expert elicitation (Bamber et al., 2019) result in higher estimates
of Greenland ice loss than any of the process-based studies, with a
mean and standard deviation of 33 + 30 cm and a 17-83% range
of 10-60 cm by 2100, following a climate scenario comparable to
RCP8.5. The combination of the new process-based studies produces
central estimates (Table 4.2) consistent with the /ikely ranges for
Greenland's contribution to GMSL in 2100 assessed by ARS.

"Unlike Greenland, most of the AlS margin terminates in the ocean. The
AIS also contains almost eight times more glacial ice above flotation
than Greenland, and nearly half of this ice is marine-based, that is,
grounded on bedrock hundreds of metres (or more) below sea level
(Figure 4.7; Fretwell et al 2013). In places where the subglacial
bedrock slopes downward away from the coast (reverse-sloped),
the marine-based glacial ice is susceptible to dynamical instabilities
(Weertman, 1974; Schoof, 2007b; Pollard et al., 2015) that can
contribute rapid ice loss (Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3). The
instabilities can be triggered by the loss or thinning of ice shelves
through changes in the surrounding ocean and increased sub-ice melt
rates and changes in the overlying atmosphere affecting SMB and
surface meltwater production. Much progress has been made since
AR3 in the understanding of these processes, but their representation in
continental-scale models continue to be heavily parameterised in most
cases. Complex interactions between the ice sheet, ocean, atmosphere
and underlying bedrock also remain difficult to simulate collectively.

"dynamic ice discharge to the ocean as the ice sheet margin thins and
the termini of outlet glaciers retreat from the coast (Goelzer et al.,
2013; Lipscomb et al., 2013). Greenland’s bedrock geography and the
limited, direct access of thick interior ice to the ocean ultimately limits
the potential pace of GMSL rise from the GIS. Figure 4.7 illustrates
a fundamental difference between Greenland and Antarctica. In
Greenland, most of the bedrock at the ice sheet margin is above sea
level (land terminating), with relatively narrow (generally <10 km
wide) outlet glaciers reaching the ocean. In contrast, Antarctica
has extensive areas with subglacial bedrock below sea level, and
thick marine-terminating ice in direct contact with the open ocean.
Recent subglacial mapping and mass conservation calculations since
ARS (Morlighem et al., 2014; Morlighem et al., 2017) revise earlier
bathymetric maps under and around the ice sheet, and reveal deeper
and more extensive valley networks extending into the GIS interior
than previously known. Accurate subglacial topography is important
for modelling individual Greenland outlet glaciers (Aschwanden
et al., 2016; Morlighem et al., 2016); however, the importance of
these revised bedrock boundary conditions for the broader ice sheet
has yet to be fully tested. Based on the limited cross sectional area of
subglacial valleys and outlet glaciers on Greenland (Figure 4.7) and
the results of Nick et al. (2013), the effects of uncertain bathymetric
boundary conditions are assessed to be small relative to the
uncertainties in future SMB forcing (medium confidence).

"While limited to 50 year simulations, Seroussi et al. (2017) provide the
first interactively coupled ice-ocean model simulations of Thwaites
Glacier at a high spatial resolution. Their model demonstrates
MISI-like grounding line retreat at a rate of ~1 km yr-', comparable
to observations between 1992 and 2011 (Rignot et al., 2014). The
retreat is interrupted when the main trunk of the glacier stabilises on
a bathymetric ridge, ~20 km upstream of the present-day grounding
line (Figure 4.8), but due to the short duration of the simulation, the
long-term potential for additional retreat into the interior of the ice
sheet is not captured.

"Like Thwaites, the neighbouring Pine Island Glacier (PIG) has also
been thinning and retreating at an accelerating rate in recent decades,
in response to incursions of warm CDW in the waters underlying the
glacier's ice shelf. These incursions of CDW are controlled in part by
sea floor bathymetry and climatic variability (Dutrieux et al., 2014).
Favier et al. (2014) used three models with differing formulations to
simulate PIG’s response to elevated sub-ice melt. Consistent with
modelling of Thwaites Glacier (Joughin et al., 2014), all three models
demonstrate sustained future retreat at an increasing rate, as the
glacier backs onto its retrograde bed. Only one of the three models
used by Favier et al. (2014) demonstrates the possibility that the
glacier can recover if sub-ice melt rates are reduced enough to allow
the ice shelf to thicken and pin on bathymetric features to provide
buttressing. These results highlight the long-term commitment to
marine-based ice loss.

"Several of West Antarctica’s major outlet glaciers, including Pine Island
Glacier, and Thwaites Glacier in the Amundsen Sea (Figure 4.8) have
grounding lines currently retreating on retrograde bedrock (Rignot
et al., 2014). Thwaites Glacier is particularly important (Figure 4.8),
because it extends into the interior of the WAIS, where the bed is
>2000 m below sea level in places. By itself, the Thwaites drainage
area contains the equivalent of ~0.4 m GMSL (Holt et al., 2006; Millan
et al, 2017), but loss of the glacier could have a destabilising impact
on the entire WAIS (Feldmann and Levermann, 2015). The WAIS
contains enough ice to raise GMSL by ~3.4 m (Fretwell et al., 2013).
Since ARS, a number of ice sheet modelling studies have focussed on
limited fractions of Antarctica and so are not included in estimating
the SROCC Antarctic contribution to GMSL (see Section 4.2.3.2).
However, these studies do allow an assessment of the potential for
persistent and increasing ice loss, and the role of the marine ice sheet
instability (MISI, see Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3).

"Observations of rapid bedrock uplift in the Amundsen Sea, low
viscosity of the underlying mantle, and short GIA response times to
glacial unloading suggest ice-Earth interactions could be important
there (Barletta et al., 2018). Bedrock uplift and reduced gravitational
attraction between the ice sheet and ocean as an ice margin loses
mass reduces RSL at the grounding line, promoting stability and
providing a negative feedback on retreat (Adhikari et al., 2014;
Gomez et al., 2015). Using a high-resolution ice sheet-Earth model,
Larour et al. (2019) showed that long-term future retreat of Amundsen
Sea grounding lines are slowed by these processes, but the effect
is found to be minimal until after ~2250. This agrees with other
recent modelling accounting for ice-Earth interactions, including the
viscoelastic Earth response to changing ice loads and self-gravitation
(Gomez et al., 2015; Konrad et al., 2015; Pollard et al., 2017). These
studies also showed a small negative feedback on future retreat over
the next several centuries, particularly under strong climate forcing.
However, the viscosity structure of the Earth under the AIS is not
well resolved, and lateral variations in Earth structure could impact
these results (Hay et al., 2017). Based on these consistent model

"Joughin et al. (2014) modelled the response of the Thwaites Glacier
to a combination of elevated sub-ice melt rates and increased
precipitation and found persistent future retreat, despite either the
partial compensation of increased accumulation or a future reduction
in melt. Sub-ice melt rates sustained at current levels were found
to generate >1 mm yr! equivalent GMSL rise within a millennium.
Higher melt rates and an assumed weak ice shelf triggered rapid
retreat within a few centuries. Similarly, Waibel et al. (2018) used
the BISICLES ice sheet model (Cornford et al., 2015) to investigate
the potential for self-sustained retreat of Thwaites Glacier, by
incrementally increasing sub-ice melt rates until retreat is triggered,
and then returning to pre-retreat melt rates. Consistent with Joughin
et al. (2014), they found self-sustained retreat of Thwaites Glacier
through MISI. Most uncertainty in their future WAIS simulations
arises from uncertainties in the long-term response of Thwaites
Glacier (Figure 4.8). Nias et al. (2016) demonstrated model sensitivity
of Thwaites Glacier to poorly resolved bedrock boundary conditions
(small scale topography), pointing to the need for better geophysical
information to reduce model uncertainty (Schlegel et al., 2018).
Arthern and Williams (2017) used adaptive mesh techniques, but with
a different formulation than Cornford et al., (2015), to simulate the
future response of Amundsen Sea outlet glaciers. They demonstrate
a sustained, but slow future retreat when sub-ice melt is maintained
at current rates, and a direct relationship between the strength of
ocean forcing and the pace of MlSI-driven ice loss. Yu et al. (2018)

deep water (CDW), with melt rates up 200 m yr~ near the groundling line in some places (Milillo et al., 2019). The bathymetry upstream of the grounding zone is complex,
but it generally slopes downward into a deep basin, up to 2000 m below sea level under the centre of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) (far left), making the glacier
vulnerable to marine ice sheet instabilities (Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3).

"Continental-scale ice sheet simulations are ultimately required
to provide projections of future GMSL rise from Antarctica. At this
spatial scale, most models rely on simplifying approximations of the

they parameterise ice flow at the grounding line (Schoof, 2007b) to
improve computational efficiency. Such simplifications are necessary
to allow long simulations that can be validated against geological
information, in addition to modern observations (Briggs et al., 2013;
Pollard et al., 2016), however processes related to MISI are best

"Various ice sheet model formulations, including the choice of
grounding line parameterisations and basal sliding schemes can
strongly affect model response to a given forcing (Brondex et al.,

have been increasingly used since AR5 to quantitatively gauge model
uncertainty (Bulthuis et al., 2019; Edwards et al, 2019). Accurate
atmospheric forcing (SMB) and sub-ice melt are also prerequisite
to resolving the time-evolving dynamics of the system, with sub-ice
melt rates being particularly important (Schlegel et al., 2018). An
important ongoing deficiency is the lack of ice-ocean coupling in
most continental-scale studies, which remains too computationally
expensive to simulate the ocean at the spatial scales necessary to
capture circulation in ice shelf cavities and time-evolving ice-ocean
interactions (Donat-Magnin et al., 2017; Hellmer et al., 2017). Instead,
melt rates are often parameterised as a depth dependent function of
nearby ocean temperature derived from offline ocean models, but
the lack of ice-ocean interaction can seriously overestimate melt

"Atmospheric forcing is also becoming increasingly recognised to be
an important factor for the future of the AIS. A sustained (15 days)
melt event over the Ross Sea sector of the WAIS in 2016 illustrated
both the connectivity of Antarctica to the tropics and El Nifio, and the
possibility that future meltwater production on ice shelf surfaces could
change in the near future (Nicolas et al., 2017). This was highlighted
by Trusel et al. (2015), who evaluated the future expansion of surface
meltwater using the snow component in the RACMO2 regional
atmospheric model (Kuipers Munneke et al., 2012) and output from
CMIP5 GCMs. Under RCP8.5, they found a substantial expansion
of surface meltwater production on ice shelves late in the 21st
century that exceed melt rates observed before the 2002 collapse
of the Larsen B Ice Shelf. Surface meltwater is important for both ice
dynamics and SMB due to its potential to reduce albedo, saturate the
firn layer, deepen surface crevasses, and to cause flexural stresses
that can contribute to ice shelf break-up (hydrofracturing) (Banwell
et al., 2013; Kuipers Munneke et al., 2014). The presence of surface
meltwater does not necessarily lead to immediate ice shelf collapse
(Bell et al., 2017b; Kingslake et al., 2017), although surface meltwater
was a precursor on ice shelves which have collapsed (Scambos et al.,
2004; Banwell et al., 2013). This dichotomy illustrates the uncertain
role of meltwater and the need for additional study. When and if melt
rates will be sufficiently high in future warming scenarios to trigger
widespread hydrofracturing is a key question, because the loss of ice
shelves is associated with the onset of marine ice sheet instabilities
(Cross-chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3). Based on the single modelling

influence on hydrofracturing of ice shelves; and 2) brittle failure of
thick, marine-terminating ice fronts that have lost their buttressing

"Bulthuis et al. (2019) used a different continental-scale ice sheet

RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios. Simulations with varying model
parameters were used to quantify uncertainties related to the
atmospheric forcing, various ice-model physics, and bedrock response
to changing ice loads. A key finding was that irrespective of model
parametric uncertainty, the strongly mitigated RCP2.6 scenario
prevents catastrophic WAIS collapse over the coming centuries. The
probabilistic projections of Antarctic GMSL contributions (Bulthuis
et al, 2019) represent a rigorous blending of physical ice sheet
modelling and uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques, albeit with
a simplistic representation of future climate and using a relatively
coarse-resolution ice sheet model. These results are well-supported
by Schlegel et al. (2018), who blend UQ with a higher resolution ice

climate forcing scheme not directly linked to time-evolving future
climate trajectories. Their 800 simulations, run to 2100, provide not
only probabilistic constraints on future GMSL-rise from Antarctica,
but an assessment of key drivers of uncertainty, including uniform
and regional dependencies on model physical parameters, climate
forcing, and boundary conditions. Sub-ice shelf melt rates provide
the greatest source of uncertainty in their projections, although the

"Golledge et al. (2015) used PISM (Parallel Ice Sheet Model;
Winkelmann et al., 2011) to simulate the future response of the AIS
to RCP emission scenarios. PISM links grounded, streaming, and shelf
flow, and has freely evolving grounding lines required to capture
MISI. PISM’s parameterised treatment of sub-ice melt applies melt
under partially grounded grid cells (Feldmann and Levermann, 2015),
making the model sensitive to subsurface ocean warming, although
the validity of this approach is contested (Arthern and Williams, 2017;
Seroussi and Morlighem, 2018; Yu et al, 2018). While providing
alternative outcomes with the two basal melt rate parameterisations,
the model is not calibrated to observations and doesn’t provide a
probability distribution. In a subsequent study Golledge et al. (2019)
used PISM, but with updated RCP climate forcing based on CMIP5
GCMs, and with sub-ice ocean melt calibrated to observations. An
offline, intermediate-complexity climate model was used to capture
global ice-climate feedbacks ignored in most other studies, but the
simulations only include RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 and do not extend
beyond 2100. Accounting for the climatic effects of meltwater input
from Greenland and Antarctica nearly doubled their estimates of
Antarctic’s contribution to GMSL in 2100 from 2.4 cm to 4.6 cm in
RCP4.5, and from 7.7 cm to 14 cm in RCP8.5. The increase is caused
by a combination of SMB decrease over the WAIS, combined with
subsurface ocean warming that increases sub-ice melt. However, the
climate model used to diagnose the spatial patterns of the atmospheric

"Ritz et al. (2015) is difficult to contextualise as they only provided
estimates for the A1B scenario and not for the RCP scenarios. Despite
this limitation their results, which are close to the other studies,
are included as if they represent RCP8.5 and as such supports the
assessment. The results by DeConto and Pollard (2016) indicate
significantly higher mass loss even for RCP4.5, potentially related to
their high surface melt rates on the ice shelves as contested by Trusel
et al. (2015). This early onset of high surface melt rates in DeConto and
Pollard (2016) leads to extensive hydrofracturing of ice shelves before
the end of the 21st century and therefore to rapid ice mass loss. For this
reason, their results and probabilistic (e.g., Kopp et al., 2017; Le Bars
et al., 2017) and statistical emulation estimates that build on them
(Edwards et al., 2019), are not used in SROCC sea level projections.
Consequently, the process-based studies by Golledge et al. (2015),
Ritz et al. (2015), Levermann et al. (2014), Golledge et al. (2019), and
Bulthuis et al. (2019) are used to assess the Antarctic contribution for
the different RCP scenarios. The study by Schlegel et al. (2018) does
not provide RCP based scenarios, but is considered as an extensive
sensitivity estimate providing a high-end estimate based on physical
process understanding of the Antarctic contribution.

"In addition to the model including MICI from DeConto and Pollard
(2016), only a subset of studies (Levermann et al., 2014; Golledge
et al., 2015; Ritz et al, 2015; Bulthuis et al, 2019; Golledge et al.,
2019), and statistical emulation of DeConto and Pollard (2016) by
Edwards et al. (2019) provide continental-scale estimates of future
Antarctic ice loss, under a range of GHG emissions scenarios. They
all provide probabilistic information, but vary considerably, both
in their physical approaches and their resulting projections of
Antarctica’s future contribution to GMSL. Such variations facilitate
the first quantitative uncertainty assessment of the full dynamical
contribution of Antarctica, which could not be made by Church
et al. (2013) in ARS. The assessment by Church et al. (2013), based
on a single statistical-physical model, reported median values (and
likely ranges) of 0.05 m (-0.04-0.13) and 0.04 m (-0.06-0.12), for
RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively, for the total Antarctic contribution
in 2081-2100 relative to 1986-2005, and added the following:
‘Based on current understanding, only the collapse of marine-based
sectors of the AIS, if initiated, could cause GMSL to rise substantially
above the likely range during the 21st century. This potential
additional contribution cannot be precisely quantified but there is
medium confidence that it would not exceed several tenths of a
metre of SLR during the 21st century (Church et al., 2013). Given the
above-mentioned publications after ARS, Antarctica’s contribution to
sea level change was reassessed and now include the possibility of
MIS! allowing for a more complete assessment of the /ikely range
of the projections for three RCP scenarios. Our assessment is based
"	Text
"Each study expresses an uncertainty in the Antarctic contribution to
GMSL rise which is, in part, dependent on a common driver, namely
regional warming. The uncertainties were therefore interpreted as
being dependent and propagate the total uncertainty accordingly. As
a result, the total uncertainty exceeds that of the individual studies,
which reflects that the individual studies only sample a fraction of
the total uncertainty. The uncertainty estimates of Levermann et al.
(2014) concentrate on the oceanic basal melt rates including a time
delay between atmosphere and ocean temperature, but do not
consider other sources of uncertainty. Ritz et al. (2015) is constrained
by observations and provides an asymmetric distribution of the rate
of mass loss. The ice sheet simulations by Golledge et al. (2015)
and Golledge et al. (2019) only provide two alternative subgrid
parameterisations for sub-ice melt, rather than a statistical estimate
of the uncertainty. The more sensitive of these two parameterisations
which induces more ice loss is challenged by Seroussi and Morlighem
(2018). In order to assess a realistic uncertainty for the total Antarctic
contribution, it was first assumed that Golledge et al. (2015) and
Golledge et al. (2019) are dependent, because they use similar
parameterisations. For each study, a probabilistic distribution is used,
assuming a normal distribution with a /ikely range bounded by the
high and low estimate from those studies. Levermann et al. (2014)
also provides two alternatives, one with and one without a time
delay between oceanic temperatures below the Antarctic ice shelves
and global mean atmospheric temperature. As it is unclear which
version best matches the updated record of ice loss presented by The
IMBIE team, (2018), results are combined assuming full probabalistic
"	Text
"parameterisations, but the glaciological processes themselves are
supported by more detailed modelling and observations (Scambos
et al., 2009; Banwell et al., 2013; Ma et al., 2017; Wise et al., 2017;
Parizek et al., 2019). DeConto and Pollard (2016) provide four
ensembles for RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios, representing
two alternative ocean model treatments and two alternative palaeo
sea level targets used to tune their model physical parameters.
However, their ensembles do not explore the full range of model
parameter space or provide a probabilistic assessment (Kopp et al.,
2017; Edwards et al., 2019). Under RCP2.6, DeConto and Pollard
(2016) find very little GMSL rise from Antarctica by 2100 (0.02-—
0.16 m), consistent with the findings of Golledge et al. (2015) and
Bulthuis et al. (2019). In contrast, their four ensemble means range
between 0.26-0.58 m for RCP4.5, and 0.64—-1.14 m for RCP8.5. In
RCP8.5, rates of GMSL rise from Antarctica exceed 5 cm yr"" in the
22nd century and contribute as much as 15 m of GMSL rise by 2500,
largely due to the ice cliff calving process. The climate forcing used by
DeConto and Pollard (2016) simulates the appearance of extensive
surface meltwater several decades earlier than indicated by other
CMIP5 climate simulations (Trusel et al., 2015). Because their model
physics are sensitive to melt water through hydrofracturing, this
makes the timing and magnitude of their simulated ice loss too
uncertain to include in SROCC sea level projections. However, their
results do demonstrate the potential for brittle ice sheet processes
not considered by AR5 to exert a strong influence on future rates
of GMSL rise and the possibility that GMSL beyond 2100 could be
considerably higher than the /ikely range projected by models that do
not include these processes.

contribution are nearly identical to ARS results used here (see
Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 2). Greenland, thermal expansion
and land water storage are also not updated, mainly due to a
lack of updated CMIP simulations. Hence, our revised projections
replace only the AR5 estimate for Antarctica by a new assessment
as outlined in the previous paragraph based on post-AR5 literature
and maintaining identical contributions for the non-Antarctic
components. As no general dependence between the Antarctic
contribution and the non-Antarctic components can be derived from
the four studies, independent uncertainties are assumed, which is

"dependence as for the two Golledge studies. Bulthuis et al. (2019)
uses a simplified ice sheet model to study the uncertainty caused
by the atmospheric forcing, ice dynamics, ice and bed rheology,
calving and sub-shelf melting. Finally, the studies by Ritz et al.
(2015), Bulthuis et al. (2019) and the averages for Golledge and
Levermann are combined to identify a best estimate for the Antarctic
contribution under RCP8.5. This results in a median contribution of
16 cm in 2100 under RCP8.5. A Monte Carlo technique is used to
combine the uncertainties in the aforementioned studies, assuming
mutual dependence. The resulting 5-95 percentile range, 2-37 cm in
2100 under RCP8.5, is assessed as the likely range. This assessment is
used in order to reflect ongoing limited understanding of the physics
and the fact that the individual studies only reflect part of the total
uncertainty. The distribution is slightly skewed to higher values,
because of an underlying skewness in the studies of Levermann et al.
(2014) and Ritz et al. (2015). This skewed distribution is supported by
an expert elicitation study (Bamber et al., 2009). The expert elicitation
approach (Bamber et al., 2018), which applied elicitation to both ice
sheets, suggests considerably higher values for total SLR for RCP2.6,
RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 than provided in Table 4.3.

processes caused by GIA that lead to horizontal and VLM. Finally,
the inverse barometer effect caused by changes in the atmospheric
pressure, sometimes neglected in projections, can also make a small

"the expert elicitation with the non-Antarctic components from ARS as
done for Table 4.4 leads to an estimated SLR of 0.95 m (median) for
the high scenario and an upper /ikely range of 1.32 m (Figure 4.2),
which is slightly higher than the process-based results. Results by
Bamber and Aspinall (2013) were criticised because of their procedure
for post-processing the expert data of individual ice sheets to a total
sea level contribution from the ice sheets (de Vries and van de Wal,
2015; Bamber et al., 2016; de Vries and van de Wal, 2016). Bamber
et al. (2019) avoids this issue by eliciting expert judgments about ice
sheet dependence. Alternatively, Horton et al. (2014) used a simpler
elicitation protocol focusing on the total SLR rather than the ice sheet
contribution alone. Finally, several probabilistic studies (e.g., Bakker
et al., 2017; Kopp et al., 2017; Le Bars et al., 2017) used the results of
a single ice sheet model study from DeConto and Pollard (2016) as the
Antarctic contribution to GMSL.

"A wide range of probabilistic sea level projections exist, ranging from
simple scaling relations to partly process-based components combined
with scaling relations. Table 4.5 illustrates the overlap between many
of the studies, a complete overview is presented by Garner et al. (2017),
and differences between different classes of models are discussed in
Horton et al. (2018). Many studies rely on CMIP simulations for an
important part of their sea level components. The largest difference
can be found in the treatment of the ice dynamics, particularly for
Antarctica, which are usually not CMIP5 based. Instead, each derives
from one of several estimates of the Antarctic contribution. These
results are useful for the purposes of elucidating sensitivities of
process-based studies and effects of changing components to the
total projection. This report relies on the Antarctic component from
Section 4.2.3.2 for calculating the likely range of RSL. Hence the values
in Table 4.5 are not used for the final assessment of RSL including
the SROCC specific Antarctic contribution presented in Section 4.2.3.2.
Comparing the probabilistic projections (Table 4.6) is difficult because
of the subtle differences between their assumptions. Nevertheless,
values range much more for 2100 than for 2050.
"	Text
"more recent studies the differences are vanishingly small. Ongoing
advances in closing the sea level budget and in the process
understanding of the dynamics of ice have reduced the salience of
estimates from semi-empirical models. Moreover, the results from
semi-empirical models (Kopp et al., 2016; Mengel et al., 2016) are
in general agreement with Church et al. (2013), except when those
results reflect the combined hydrofracturing and ice cliff instability
mechanism as presented by DeConto and Pollard (2016). At the same
time, semi-empirical models based on past observations capture
poorly or miss altogether the recent observed changes in Antarctica.
MISI may lend a very different character to ice sheet evolution in
the near future than in the recent past and hydrofracturing remains
impossible to quantify from observational records only. For this
reason, a new generation of semi-empirical models and emulators
has been developed that estimate individual components of SLR,
which the former models do not (Mengel et al., 2018). These newer
models aim to emulate the response of more complex models
providing more detailed information for different climate scenarios
or probability estimates than process-based models (Bakker et al.,
2017; Nauels et al., 2017a; Wong et al., 2017; Edwards et al., 2019).

"ESL events are water level heights that consist of contributions from
mean sea level, storm surges and tides. Compound effects of surges
and tides are drivers of the ESL events. Section 4.2.3.4.1 discusses
the combination of mean sea level change with a characterisation
of the ESL events derived from tide gauges over the historical period
and the sections 4.2.3.4.2 and 4.2.3.4.3 evaluate possible changes
in these characteristics caused by cyclones and waves. This section
discusses the importance of ESL and different modelling strategies to
improve our understanding of ESL projections.
"	Text
"Even a small increase in mean sea level can significantly augment
the frequency and intensity of flooding. This is because SLR elevates
the platform for storm surges, tides, and waves, and because there is
a log-linear relationship between a flood's height and its occurrence
interval. Changes are most pronounced in shelf seas. Roughly 1.3%
of the global population is exposed to a 1 in 100-year™ flood (Muis
et al., 2016). This exposure to ESL and resulting damage could
increase significantly with SLR, potentially amounting to 10% of the
global GDP by the end of the century in the absence of adaptation
(Hinkel et al., 2014).
"	Text
"Changes in ESL are presented here, based on the projections as
presented in 4.2.3.2 at the tide gauge locations in the GESLA2
database (Woodworth et al., 2016). Results include GIA effects, but
anthropogenic subsidence is not prescribed. These calculations serve
as a signal to guide adaption to SLR (Stephens et al., 2018). Return
periods are calculated as a combination of regional RSL projections
and a probabilistic characterisation of the variability in sea level as
derived from the GESLA2 data set which contains a quasi-global
set of tide gauges. By doing so, it is assumed that the variability in
the tide gauge record does not change over time. Models are not
accurate enough to address whether this is correct or not.
"	Text
"To quantify the average return period of ESL events, a peak-over-
threshold method is applied following Arns et al. (2013) and Wahl
et al. (2017). Tide gauge records are detrended by subtracting a
running mean of one year. Peaks above the 99th percentile of hourly
water levels are extracted and declustered by applying a minimum
time between peaks of 72 hours. This threshold of 99% was
recommended by Wahl et al. (2017) for global applications. Using
a maximum likelihood estimator, a Generalized Pareto Distribution
(GPD) is fitted to these peaks, allowing for an extrapolation to
return periods beyond the available period of observations. Changes
in ESL events due to regional mean SLR are quantified following
Hunter (2010). Uncertainties in the GPD parameters and projections
are propagated using a Monte Carlo approach, from which a best
estimate is derived (see SM4.2). Only tide gauge records of 20 years

"An advantage of the use of hydrodynamic models is that they can
quantify interactions between the different components of ESL (Arns
et al., 2013). Hydrodynamical models can be executed over the entire
ocean with flexible grids at a high resolution (up to 1/20°or ~5 km)
where necessary, appropriate for local estimates (Kernkamp et al.,
2011). Input for these models are wind speed and direction, and
atmospheric pressure. Results of those models show that the Root
Mean Squared Error between modelled and observed sea level is
less than 0.2 m for 80% of a data set of 472 stations covering the
global coastline (Muis et al., 2016) at 10-minute temporal resolution
over a reference period from 1980-2011. This implies that for most
locations it can be used to describe the variability in ESL. However,
the areas where ESL is dominated by tropical storms are problematic
for hydrodynamical models. Another difficulty arises when these
models are forced with climate models: they inherit the limitations
"	Text
"The frequency and intensity of ESL events can be estimated with
statistical models or hydrodynamical models constrained by
observations. Hydrodynamic models simulate a series of ESL events
over time, which can then be fitted by extreme value distributions
to estimate the frequency and intensity (e.g. the return level of an
event occurring with a period of 100 years or frequency of 0.01 yr"",
also called the 100-year event). A tide model is sometimes included
and sometimes added offline to estimate the ESL events. Statistical
models fit tide gauge observations to extreme value distributions to
directly estimate ESL events or combine probabilistic RSL scenarios
with storm surge modelling. This can be done on global scale or
local scale. For example, Lin et al. (2016) and Garner et al. (2017)
estimate the increase in flood frequency along the US east coast.
Both of these modelling approaches can account for projections of
SLR. Rasmussen et al. (2018) used a combination of a global network
of tide gauges and a probabilistic localised SLR to estimate expected
ESL events showing inundation reductions for different temperature
stabilisation targets as shown in the SR15 report.
"	Text
"Statistical models have shown that the estimation of ESL is highly
sensitive to the characterisation of SLR and flood frequency
distributions (Buchanan et al., 2017). This is confirmed by Wahl et al.
(2017) who estimate that the 5-95 percentile uncertainty range,
attained through the application of different statistical extreme
value methods and record lengths, of the current 100-year event is
on average 40 cm, whereas the corresponding range in projected
GMSL of AR5 under RCP8.5 is 37 cm. For ESL events with a higher
return period, differences will be larger. Capturing changes in the ESL
return periods in the future is even more complicated because both
the changing variability over time and the uncertainty in the mean
projection must be combined. A statistical framework to combine
RSL and ESL, based on historical tide gauge data was applied to
the US coastlines (Buchanan et al., 2016). Hunter (2012) and the
AR5 (Church et al., 2013) projected changes in flood frequency
worldwide; however, these analyses used the Gumbel distribution
for high water return periods, which implies that the frequency of
all ESLs (e.g., whether the 1in 10-year or 1 in 500-year) will change
by the same magnitude for a given RSL, an approximation that can
underestimate or overestimate ESL (Buchanan et al., 2017). Hence,
the amplification factors of future storm return frequency in AR5 WGI
Figure 13.25 may underestimate flood hazards in some areas, while
overestimating them in others. By using the Gumbel distribution,
Muis et al. (2016) may also inadequately estimate flood frequencies.

frequency of extremes. In comparison, locations with small variability
in ESL events (e.g., Lautoka and Papeete) will experience large
amplifications even for a moderate rise in mean sea level (Vitousek

and small amplification factors becomes clear for projections by
mid-century (Fig 4.11, left panels). Although regional differences
in projected mean SLR are small for the coming centuries, regional
contrasts in amplification factors are considerable. In particular,

in low-latitude regions, away from the tropical cyclone (TC) tracks.
In these locations, historical sea level variability due to tides and
storm surges is small compared to projected mean SLR. Therefore,
even limited changes in mean sea level will have a noticeable effect
on ESLs, and for some locations, even RCP2.6 will lead to the annual
occurrence of historically rare events by mid-century. Results should
be treated with caution in regions where TCs are important as they
are underrepresented in the observations (Haigh et al., 2014a).

"A number of studies have included waves, in addition to tides and
sea level anomalies, to assess coastal vulnerability to SLR using
dynamical and statistical approaches. CoSMoS (Barnard et al.,
2014) includes a series of embedded wave models to estimate high
resolution projections of total water levels along the Southern
California coast for different extreme scenarios (O'Neill et al., 2017).
Arns et al. (2017) find that an increase in sea level may reduce the
depth-limitation of waves, thereby resulting in waves with greater
energy approaching the coast. Including wave effects is crucial for
coastal adaptation and planning (e.g., Isobe, 2013). For example Arns
et al. (2017) report that coastal protection design heights need to be
increased by 48-56% in the German Bight region relative to a design
height based on the effect of SLR on ESL only. Combining SLR with
extreme value theory applied to past observations of tides, storm
surges and waves, Vitousek et al. (2017) found that a 10-20 cm SLR
could result in a doubling of coastal flooding frequency in the tropics.
For the southern North Sea region, Weisse et al. (2012) argue that
increasing storm activity also increases hazards from ESL events.
Global-scale projections of ESL event changes including wave setup
indicate a very likely increase of the global average 100-year ESL
of 58-172 cm under RCP8.5 (Vousdoukas et al., 2018c). Changes in
storm surges and waves enhance the effects of relative SLR along the
majority of northern European coasts, with contributions up to 40%
in the North Sea (Vousdoukas et al., 2017).

"A warming climate is expected to affect wind patterns and storm
characteristics, which in turn will impact wind waves that contribute
to high coastal water levels. Wind-wave projections are commonly
based on dynamical and statistical wave models forced by projected
surface winds from GCMs, notably those participating in the CMIP.
In the framework of the Coordinated Ocean Wave Climate Project
(COWCLIP), an ensemble of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
Phase 3 (CMIP3)-based global wave projections (Hemer et al.,
2013) was produced and the results were summarised in the AR5
(WGI Chapter 13). Casas-Prat et al. (2018) expanded the geographic
domain to include the Arctic Ocean, highlighting the vulnerability of
high-latitude coastlines to wave action as ice retreats. Reduced sea
ice allows larger waves and stronger cyclones in the Arctic Ocean,
which can further disrupt and break up sea ice (e.g., Thomson and
Rogers, 2014; Day and Hodges, 2018). A review and consensus-based
analysis of regional and global scale wave projections, including
CMIP5-based projections, has been provided by Morim et al. (2018)
as part of COWCLIP. Projections of annual and seasonal mean
significant wave height changes agree on an increase in the Southern
Ocean, tropical eastern Pacific and Baltic Sea; and on a decrease over
the North Atlantic, northwestern Pacific and Mediterranean Sea.
Projections of mean significant wave height lack consensus over
the eastern North Pacific and southern Indian and Atlantic Oceans.
Projections of future extreme significant wave height are consistent
in projecting an increase over the Southern Ocean and a decrease
over the northeastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. Regional
projections of wind-waves have mostly been applied to Europe so far,
while highly vulnerable regions have been largely overlooked. This is

"Sea level at the end of the century will be higher than present day
and continuing to rise in all cases even if the Paris Agreement is
followed (Nicholls, 2018). The reasons for this are mainly related to
the slow response of glacier melt, thermal expansion and ice sheet
mass loss (Solomon et al., 2009). These processes operate on long
time scales, implying that even if the rise in global temperature slows
or the trend reverses, sea level will continue to rise (SR1.5 report,
ARS). A study by Levermann et al. (2013) based on palaeo-evidence
and physical models formed the basis of the assessment by Church
et al. (2013) indicating that committed SLR is approximately
2.3 m per degree warming for the next 2000 years with respect to
pre-industrial temperatures. This rate is based on a relation between
ocean warming and basal melt as used by Levermann et al. (2013),
without accounting for surface melt, hydrofracturing of ice shelves
and subsequent ice cliff failure, suggested to be a dominant long
term mechanism for ice mass loss (DeConto and Pollard, 2016). Deep
uncertainty (Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1) remains on the ice
dynamical contribution from Antarctica after 2100.

"Beyond the 21st century, the relative importance of the long-term
contributions of the various components of SLR changes markedly.
For glaciers, the long-term is of limited importance, because the sea
level equivalent of all glaciers is restricted to 0.32 + 0.08 m when
taking account of ice mass above present day sea level (Farinotti
et al., 2019). Hence, there is high confidence that the contribution
of glaciers to SLR expressed as a rate will decrease over the 22nd
century under RCP8.5 (Marzeion et al., 2012). For thermal expansion
the gradual rate of heat absorption in the ocean will lead to a further
SLR for several centuries (Zickfeld et al. 2017). By far, the most
important uncertainty on long time scales arises from the contribution
of the major ice sheets. The time scale of response of ice sheets is
thousands of years. Hence, if ice sheets contribute significantly to sea
level in 2100, they will necessarily also contribute to sea level in the
centuries to follow. Only for low emission scenarios, like RCP2.6, can
substantial ice loss be prevented, according to ice dynamical models

developed, and the ability to simulate TCs has been substantially

already underway and possibly capable of driving major WAIS
retreat on century time scales. Whether the retreat is driven by ocean
changes driven by climate change or by climate variability Jenkins

"Gradual melt of ice shelves accompanied by partial retreat of East
Antarctic ice would yield greater ice melt but on a time scale of
millennial or longer (Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3). Prescribing
a uniform warming of 2°C-3°C in the Southern Ocean triggers an
accelerated decay of West Antarctica in a coarse resolution model
with a temperature-driven basal melt formulation yielding 1-2 m
SLR by the year 3000 and up to 4 m by the year 5000 (Sutter et al.,

scales the interaction between ice and the solid Earth indicates the
possibility of a negative feedback slowing retreat by viscoelastic

have the potential to drive faster rates of ice mass loss than the
SMB processes that are /ikely to dominate the future loss of ice

represents a long-term (millennial) commitment to elevated SLR, due
to the long thermal memory of the ocean. Once marine based Antarctic
ice is lost, local ocean temperatures will have to cool sufficiently
for buttressing ice shelves to reform, allowing retreated grounding
lines to re-advance (DeConto and Pollard, 2016). A minimum time
scale, whereby the majority of West Antarctica decays, was derived
from a schematic experiment with an ice flow model by Golledge

surface lowering increases ablation further (positive feedback). As
a consequence, the ice sheet will significantly retreat. Church et al.

balance based on modelling studies lies between 1°C (Robinson
et al., 2012; low confidence) and 4°C (medium confidence) above
pre-industrial temperatures. Pattyn et al. (2018) demonstrated that
with more than 2.0°C of summer warming, it becomes more likely
than not that the GIS crosses a tipping point, and the ice sheet will
enter a long-term state of decline with the potential loss of most or all
of the ice sheet over thousands of years. If the warming is sustained,
ice loss could become irreversible due to the initiation of positive
feedbacks associated with elevation-SMB feedback (reinforced
surface melt as the ice sheet surface lowers into warmer elevations),
and albedo-melt feedback associated with darkening of the ice
surface due to the presence of liquid water, loss of snow, changes in
firn and biological processes (Tedesco et al., 2016; Ryan et al., 2018).
The precise temperature threshold and duration of warming required

"A blended statistical and physical model, calibrated by observed
recent ice loss in a few basins (Ritz et al., 2015) projects an Antarctic
contribution to sea level of 30 cm by 2100 and 72 cm by 2200,
following the SRES A1B scenario, roughly comparable to RCP6.0.
The projected contribution of WAIS was found to be limited to 48 cm
in 2200 following the A1B scenario. The key uncertainty in these
calculations comes from the dependency on the relation between the
sliding velocity and the friction at the ice-bedrock interface. Several
parameterisations are used to describe this process. Golledge et al.
(2015) present values between 0.6-3 m by 2300 for the RCP8.5
scenario. In contrast to the previous studies, Cornford et al. (2015)
used an adaptive grid model, which can describe more accurately
grounding line migration (Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3). Due
to the computational complexity of their model, simulations are
limited to West Antarctica. Starting from present-day observations,
they find that the results are critically dependent on initial conditions,
sub ice shelf melt rates, and grid resolution. The glacier with the
most uncertain vulnerability is the 120 km-wide Thwaites Glacier,
in the Amundsen Sea sector of West Antarctica. Thwaites Glacier is
currently retreating in a reverse-sloped trough extending into the
central WAIS (Figure 4.8), where the bed is up to 2 km below sea
level. In addition to Thwaites, several smaller outlet glaciers and ice
streams may contribute to sea level on long time scales, but in the
study by Cornford et al. (2015), a full West Antarctic retreat does
not occur with limited oceanic heating under the two major ice
shelves (Filchner-Ronne and Ross) keeping ice streams flowing into
the Ross and Weddell Seas in place. However, the representation of
these processes remains simplistic at the continental ice sheet scale

A complete loss of Greenland ice contributing about 7 m to sea
level over a millennium or more would occur for sustained GMST
between 1°C (low confidence) and 4°C (medium confidence) above
pre-industrial levels. Due to deep uncertainties regarding the dominant
processes that could trigger a major retreat, there is Jow confidence
in the estimates of the contribution of the AIS beyond 2100, but our
estimates (2.3-5.4 m in 2300) for RCP8.5 are considerably higher
than presented in ARS. High-emission scenarios or exhaustion of
fossil fuels over a multi-century period lead to rates of SLR as high
as several metres per century in the long term (low confidence).
Low-emission scenarios lead to a limited contribution over
multi-century time scales (high confidence). Discriminating between
1.5°C and 2°C scenarios in terms of long-term sea level change is not
possible with the limited evidence. Hence, it is concluded that the
SLR on millennial time scales is strongly dependent on the emission
scenario followed. This, combined with the lack in predictability
of the tipping points, indicates the importance of emissions
mitigation for minimising the risk to low-lying coastlines and islands

"Similar to the strategy for the 21st century, the long-term projections
of sea level were assessed. Since no new CMIP runs are available
there are no major new insights in the thermal expansion and
glacier component which deviate from the AR5 assessment for the
long-term contribution of these components. Some studies updated
the contribution of the GIS on long time scales. Vizcaino et al. (2015)
used a GCM coupled to an ice sheet model to calculate the Greenland
contribution which is within the range of estimates presented by
Church et al. (2013). This is also true for the ice sheet simulations
by Calov et al. (2018) which are based on off line simulations with
a regional climate model forced by RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios of
three different CMIP5 models. On the other hand, Aschwanden et al.
(2019) used temperatures to calculate SMB which was used to force
an ice sheet model to arrive at much higher values for SLR. However,
they used a spatially uniform temperature forcing, which is in conflict
with earlier work and overestimated temperatures in the ablation
zone (eg., Van de Wal and Wild, 2001; Gregory and Huybrechts,
2006). Given this limited and contrasting evidence for Greenland,
the assessed values presented in Table 13.8 of Church et al. (2013)
were also used, but again replacing the Antarctic component by the
assessed value from the process and climate scenario-based studies
published after 2013. The low scenario in Table 13.8 of Church et al.

"Past updates of the flood defences in Shanghai occurred after extreme flood events (i.e., typhoons in 1962, 1974 and 1981; Xian et al.,
2018). In contrast, the flood tide of Hurricane Sandy stands out in the record at the Battery tide gauge. Unlike the numerous episodes of
severe inundation experienced by Shanghai, NYC suffered relatively moderate consequences from individual events before Hurricane
Sandy. This and other factors led to higher-standard flood protection measures in Shanghai, such as sea walls designed to protect its
coastlines and critical infrastructure in developed areas against a 200-year (0.005 annual chance) flood level, and flood walls with
1000-year (0.001 annual chance) riverine flood return level along the Huangpu River. New York City, on the other hand, has relatively
low protection, consisting of sandy dunes (e.g., on Staten Island), vegetation (e.g., in Queens) and low-rise sea walls or bulkheads in
lower Manhattan. Another reason why Shanghai has repeatedly updated its flood protection while New York City failed to do so lies in
their differing governance structures (Wei and Leung, 2005; Yin et al., 2011; Rosenzweig and Solecki, 2014), as well as rapid economic
growth in China, providing funding for large-scale infrastructure (Zhang, 2003).

Coastal hazard for the Nile delta arises because large portions lie only +1.5 m above sea level (Shaltout et al., 2015) and while the
Delta includes only 2% of Egypt's total area, it held 41% of its population as of 2006 (Hereher, 2010; World Bank, 2017) and is key
to Egypt's economy (Bucx et al., 2010). The delta is an important resource for Egypt's fish farms (Hereher, 2009; El-Sayed, 2016) and
contains more than 63% of Egypt's cultivated lands (Hereher, 2010). The Nile Delta's coastal lagoons are internationally renowned
for abundant bird life, account for one fourth of Mediterranean wetlands and 60% of Egypt's fish catch (Government of Egypt, 2016).
Coastal flooding and salinisation of freshwater lagoons would negatively affect fisheries and biodiversity (UNDP, 2017).
"	Text
"The Nile Delta's low elevation translates into high exposure to SLR (Shaltout et al., 2015), and the level of protection varies greatly
from place to place (Frihy et al., 2010). Box 4.1, Figure 1 indicates that episodic flooding will increase substantially without effective
adaptation measures. An estimated 2660 km? in the northern delta will be inundated by 2100 for GMSL of 0.44 m (Gebremichael
et al., 2018; low confidence), which is comparable to the RCP2.6 emission scenario. In addition, subsidence due to sediment diversion
by the Aswan High Dam, water and natural gas extraction (Gebremichael et al., 2018) and some other critical natural aspects (Frihy
et al., 2010) heightens vulnerability to coastal flooding (Box 4.1, Table 3) and reduces fresh water supply to the delta. Subsidence
rates range from 0.4 mm yr in the west delta to 1.1 mm yr in the mid-delta and 3.4 mm yr” in the east delta (Elshinnawy et al.,
2010), although rates as high as 10 mm yr near natural gas extraction operations are also reported (Gebremichael et al., 2018).
While there is low confidence in reported values, these indicate that subsidence makes locally a substantial contribution to RSL. Future
construction of Ethiopia's Grand Renaissance Dam (Stanley and Clemente, 2017) may heighten problems of fresh water availability
and reduce hydropower production.

Exposure and Vulnerability

Current exposure and vulnerability considers topographic
elevation and human drivers.

Exposure and vulnerability for current and future time periods would
take into account projections that consider both biophysical and human
drivers (Section 4.3.3).

 

Levels of Risk

Reflect current hazard plus various freeboard for NYC; 0.5 m
for Shanghai, with no consideration of changes to date in
storm characteristics and socioeconomic factors.

Use risk scenarios to reflect the full suite of climate change and socio-
economic changes and their interdependency for the planned coastal
projects (Section 4.4.4.3); use freeboard that accounts for ESL uncer-
tainty, such as ESL with probability >5% during planning horizon.

 

Response Options

Protection measures: fixed-height sea wall for both NYC and
Shanghai; for NYC: building retrofit, ecosystem-based mea-
sures such as dune enhancement. Accommodation measures
for NYC: insurance, building codes.

Consider locally appropriate, sequenced mix of hard protection, EbA,
accommodation and retreat measures to minimise combined total costs;
more flexible design that reflects the dynamic risk (Section 4.4.2).

 

Planning and Decision
Making

Funding and governance issues slow down long-term plan-
ning and implementation process, especially for NYC.

Flexible adaptation responses to uncertain long-term risk facilitate SLR
planning and implementation (Section 4.4.4.3). Take into account vul-
nerability and equity implications, and continuously involve stakeholders
in locally appropriate ways.

 

Governance and Institutional
Dimensions

 

 

Shanghai has relatively high autonomy in China context
and alignment of central and local Governments’ objectives;
NYC's decision making occurs in context of city-to-national
multi-level governance.

 

More effective coordination of planning, finance, and transparency
among local, regional, and national government agencies, and between
government, civil society, and the private sector, enables response to
increasing risks (Section 4.4.5).

Since the IPCC Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters (SREX) report, vulnerability has been
more consistently considered in climate risk assessments (medium confidence). It is recognised that climate risk is not only
hazard-driven, but also a sociopolitical and economic phenomenon that evolves with changing societal and institutional conditions

vulnerability as a pre-existing condition while some interpret vulnerability as an outcome (Jurgilevich et al., 2017).

The dynamic nature of vulnerability, and the need to align climate forecasts with socioeconomic scenarios, was a key message of
IPCC SREX. Challenges in methodology and data availability, particularly of future socioeconomic data is overcome by extrapolating
empirical information of past trends in vulnerability to flooding (longman et al., 2015; Mechler and Bouwer, 2015; Kreibich et al.,
2017), downscaling global scenarios, for example, the SSPs (Van Ruijven et al., 2014; Viguié et al., 2014; Absar and Preston, 2015),
or by using participatory methods, surveys and interviews to develop future scenarios (Ordofiez and Duinker, 2015; Tellman et al.,
2016). The uncertainty of the downscaled projections needs to be considered along with the limitation that, even if population
data projections are available, the future level of education, poverty, etc. is hard to predict (Jurgilevich et al., 2017). Suggestions
to overcome these shortcomings entail the use of a combination of different data sources for triangulation and inclusion of
uncertainties (Hewitson et al, 2014), or the meaningful involvement of stakeholders to project plausible future socioeconomic

Exposure assessment is frequently based on census data, which is available at coarse resolutions. However, new technologies
(e.g., drones and mobile phone data) and more available satellite products provide new tools for exposure analysis. Exposure
assessment is increasingly based on the combination of high resolution satellite imagery and spatio-temporal population modelling
as well as improved quality of digital elevation models (DEM; Kulp and Strauss, 2017). This is used to understand better exposure to
coastal flooding (Kulp and Strauss, 2017), diurnal differences in flood risk exposure (Smith et al., 2016), dynamic gridded population
information for daily and seasonal differences in exposure (Renner et al., 2017), a combination of remotely-sensed and geospatial
data with modelling for a gridded prediction of population density at ~100 m spatial resolution (Stevens et al., 2015), or open building
data using building locations, footprint areas and heights (Figueiredo and Martina, 2016). In addition, methods based on mobile
phone data (Deville et al, 2014; Ahas et al., 2015), and social media-based participation are increasingly available for population
distribution mapping (Steiger et al., 2015). Some of these methodologies have been already applied in coastal assessments (Smith
et al., 2016). Integrating daily and seasonal changes with the distribution of population improves population exposure information for
risk assessments especially in areas with highly dynamic population distributions, as shown in high tourism areas in mountain regions
(e.g., Renner et al., 2017), which would have advantages at touristic coastal areas as well.

Recent studies assess exposure considering not only projected sea levels but also expected changes in population size Jongman et al.,
2012; Hauer et al., 2016). It involves different socioeconomic scenarios together with changing growth rates for coastal areas and
the hinterland (Neumann et al., 2015) and using spatially explicit simulation models for urban, residential and rural areas (Sleeter
et al., 2017). Migration-based changes in population distribution (Merkens et al., 2016; Hauer, 2017) are also considered, as well as
simulated future land use (specifically urban growth) to investigate future exposure to SLR (Song et al., 2017). Other studies assess
future exposure trends by accounting for the role of varying patterns of topography and development projections leading to different
rates of anticipated future exposure (Kulp and Strauss, 2017), which influence how effectively coastal communities can adapt. Recent
studies aim to account for the sociodemographic characteristics of potentially exposed future populations (Shepherd and Binita,
2015), and anticipate future risk by projecting the evolution of the exposure of vulnerable populations and groups (Hardy and Hauer,
2018). Using social heterogeneity modelling when developing future exposure scenarios enhances the quality of risk assessments
in coastal areas (Rao et al., 2017; Hardy and Hauer, 2018). Subnational population dynamics combined with an extended coastal
narrative-based version of the five shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP) for global coastal population distribution was used for
assessing global climate impacts at the coast, highlighting regions where high coastal population growth is expected and which
therefore face increased exposure to coastal flooding (Merkens et al., 2016). SSPs have also been used to estimate future population
in regional coastal-hazard risk exposure studies (Vousdoukas et al., 2018b).

Increasingly, multi-hazard risk assessments are undertaken at the coast (e.g., flooding and inundation of coastal lands in India; Kunte

interactions where one hazard triggers another or increases the probability of others occurring. Liu et al. (2016a) provide a systematic
hazard interaction classification based on the geophysical environment that allows for the consideration of all possible interactions
(independent, mutex, parallel and series) between different hazards, and for the calculation of the probability and magnitude of

The use of vulnerability functions has been shown to be helpful in assessing the damage response of buildings to tsunamis (Tarbotton

of different vulnerability indicators (e.g., proximity to the sea cannot always be fully compensated by being wealthy), the concepts
of preference, indifference and dominance thresholds have been applied as a form of data aggregation (Tonmoy and El-Zein, 2018).
Similar to advances in exposure assessments, freely available data and mobile technologies hold promise for enabling better input

Especially in rural, natural resource-dependent settings, where the population directly rely on the services provided by ecosystems, the
vulnerability of the ecosystems (e.g., fragmented, degraded ecosystems with low biodiversity) directly influence that of the population.
Since AR5, several methods have been developed and piloted to assess and map social-ecological vulnerability. Examples include
the use of i) the sustainable livelihood approach and resource dependence metrics for Australian coastal communities (Metcalf

and tourism (high confidence; Foster et al., 2017). The vulnerability of
exposed ecosystems is highly variable, as shown in intertidal rocky
reef habitats in Australia (high confidence; Thorner et al., 2014). Even
without SLR, the transition zone between two coastal ecosystems and
adjacent uplands responds dynamically and rapidly to interannual
changes in inundation, with local factors, such as management of
water control structures, outweighing regional ones (Wasson et al.,

Global and local-scale processes influence the stability of coastal
ecosystems and can interact to restrict ecosystem responses to SLR,
and thus increase their vulnerability. At the global scale, changes in
precipitation and air temperature represent a potentially significant
risk that increases the vulnerability of ecosystems to SLR and
related hazards (Garner et al., 2015; Osland et al., 2017). Maximum
temperature and mean precipitation change over the last 100 years
are main drivers of global ecosystem instability (Mantyka-Pringle
et al., 2013), with marked regional and local variations. In addition,
seawater warming may affect marine communities and ecosystems
but research remains sparse and results are contradictory (Crespo
et al., 2017; Hernan et al., 2017). The synergistic effects between
climate change and habitat loss due to human impact and urban
development are increasingly well-documented but the effects are
still not well-known at larger spatial and temporal scales (Kaniewski
et al. 2014; Sherwood and Greening, 2014). Although evidence
is limited, recurrent disturbances may lead to losses in ecosystem
adaptive capacity (Villnas et al, 2013).

"In contrast, ecosystems with strong physical influences controlling
elevation (sediment accretion and subsidence), even where mangrove
replacement of salt marsh is expected, do not show changes in their
vulnerability to SLR (McKee and Vervaeke, 2018), suggesting strong
resilience of some coastal ecosystems. In areas such as South Florida,
the wider Caribbean and the India-Pacific mangrove region (Lovelock
et al., 2015), however, mangroves cannot outpace current SLR rates,
and are at risk of disappearing. These regional and local effects are
highly variable (even contradictory between studies; e.g., Smoak
et al., 2013; Koch et al., 2015) and are related to local conditions
shaping vulnerability such as topography and controls over salinity
from freshwater and inputs (Flower et al., 2017), but further research
on the mass and surface energy balance is needed (Barr et al., 2013).
In addition, the responses and behaviour of private landowners, who
could impede landward migration of ecosystems, is incipient, but
needs to be taken into account in assessing the ability of coastal
ecosystems to respond to climate change (Field et al., 2017). Overall,
the long-term resilience of some coastal vegetation communities,
and their ability to respond to rapid changes in sea level, is not well
developed (Foster et al., 2017).

and related impacts are influenced by a variety of local social and/
or environmental processes unrelated to climate (e.g., anthropogenic
subsidence, glacial isostatic adjustment, sediment supply and
coastal squeeze). Some of these processes are partly attributable as
anthropogenic drivers, and although they may or may not be directly
related to RSL rise, they do cause changes in coastal ecosystem
habitat connectivity and ecosystem health conditions, for instance,
and consequently influence the ability of coastal social-ecological

"However, the scientific literature still barely deals with the
exposure and vulnerability of social-ecological systems to SLR
specifically. Papers predominantly analyse the immediate and
delayed consequences of extreme events such as TCs, storms and
distant swells (see Section 6.3.3), for instance, and the resulting
exposure and vulnerability ‘in the context of SLR’ (Woodruff et al.,
2013). One reason for this touches on the difficulty for society to
fully comprehend and for science to fully analyse long-term gradual
changes like SLR (Fincher et al., 2014; Oppenheimer and Alley, 2016;
Elrick-Barr et al., 2017). Consequently, Sections 4.3.2.2 to 4.3.2.5

"Coastal areas, including deltas, are highly dynamic as they are
affected by natural and/or human-induced processes locally or

Sediment supply reaching the coast is a critical factor for delta
sustainability (Tessler et al., 2018) and has declined drastically in the
last few decades due to dam construction, land use changes and
sand mining (Ouillon, 2018; high confidence). For instance, Anthony

"Population densification also affects rural areas’ exposure and
vulnerability, and interacts with other factors shaping settlement
patterns, such as the fact that ‘indigenous peoples in multiple
geographical contexts have been pushed into marginalised
territories that are more sensitive to climate impacts, in turn limiting
their access to food, cultural resources, traditional livelihoods and
place-based knowledge (...) [and therefore undermining] aspects of
social-cultural resilience’ (Ford et al., 2016b, p. 350). In the Pacific,
for example, ‘while traditional settlements on high islands (...) were
often located inland, the move to coastal locations was encouraged
by colonial and religious authorities and more recently through the
development of tourism’ (Ballu et al, 2011; Nurse et al., 2014, p.
1623; Duvat et al., 2017). Although these population movements
are orders of magnitude smaller than the global trends described
above, they play a critical role at the very local scale in explaining
the emergence of, or changes in exposure and vulnerability. In atoll
contexts, for example, the growing pressure on freshwater resources
together with a loss in local knowledge (e.g., how to collect water
from palm trees), result in increased exposure of communities to
brackish, polluted groundwater, inducing water insecurity and health
problems (Storey and Hunter, 2010; Lazrus, 2015).

"Major changes in coastal settlement patterns have occurred in the
course of the 20th century, and are continuing to take place due to
various complex interacting processes (Moser et al., 2012; Bennett
et al., 2016) that together configure and concentrate exposure and
vulnerability to climate change and SLR along the coast (Newton
et al, 2012; Bennett et al., 2016). These processes include population
growth and demographic changes (Smith, 2011; Neumann et al.,
2015), urbanisation and a rural exodus, tourism development, and
displacement or (re)settlement of some indigenous communities
(Ford et al., 2015). This has resulted in a growing number of people
living in the Low Elevation Coastal Zone (LECZ, coastal areas below
10 m of elevation; around 11% of the world’s population in 2010;

for long-term flood mitigation such as improved river-floodplain
connectivity, the controlled redirection of a river (i.e., avulsions)

the redirection of future development to lands less prone to extreme
flooding (Renaud et al., 2013; Day et al, 2016; Brakenridge et al.,

"Preserved coastal habitats can play important roles in reducing risks
related to some coastal hazards and initiatives are being put in place
to reduce coastal squeeze, such as managed realignment (Sections
4.1, 4.4.3.1) which includes removing inland barriers (Doody, 2013).
Coastal squeeze can lead to degradation of coastal ecosystems and
species (Martinez et al., 2014), but if inland migration is unencumbered,
observation data and modelling have shown that the net area of coastal
ecosystems could increase under various scenarios of SLR, depending
on the ecosystems considered (Torio and Chmura, 2015; Kirwan
et al., 2016; Mills et al., 2016). However, recent modelling research
has shown that rapid SLR in a context of coastal squeeze could be
detrimental to the areal extent and functionality of coastal ecosystems
(Mills et al., 2016) and, for marshes, could lead to a reduction of habitat
complexity and loss of connectivity, thus affecting both aquatic and
terrestrial organisms (Torio and Chmura, 2015). Contraction of marsh
extent is also identified by Kirwan et al. (2016) when artificial barriers
to landward migration are in place. Adaptation to SLR therefore needs
to account for both development and conservation objectives so
that trade-offs between protection and realignment that satisfy both
objectives can be identified (Mills et al., 2016).

"Shoreline erosion leads to coastal squeeze if the eroding coastline
approaches fixed and hard built or natural structures as noted in
ARS (Pontee, 2013; Wong et al., 2014), a process to which SLR also
contributes (Doody, 2013; Pontee, 2013). The AR5 further noted that
coastal squeeze is expected to accelerate due to rising sea levels
(Wong et al., 2014). Doody (2013) characterised coastal squeeze as
coastal habitats being pushed landward through the effects of SLR
and other coastal processes on the one hand and, on the other hand,
the presence of static natural or artificial barriers effectively blocking
this migration, thereby squeezing habitats into an ever narrowing
space. Distinctions are made between coastal squeeze being limited
to (1) the consequences of SLR vs. other environmental changes on
the coastline and (2) the presence of only coastal defence structures
vs. natural sloping land or other artificial infrastructure (Pontee,
2013). Recent publications have emphasised coastal squeeze related
to SLR, although inland infrastructure blocking habitat migration
is not necessarily limited to defence structures (Torio and Chmura,
2015; McDougall, 2017). Coastal ecosystem degradation by human
activities leading to coastal erosion is also an important consideration
(McDougall, 2017). Taking into consideration the current challenges
to attribute coastal impacts to SLR (Section 4.3.3.1), it can be
hypothesised here that as long as SLR impacts remain moderate, the
dominant driving factor of coastal squeeze will be anthropogenic
land-based development (e.g., Section 4.3.2.2). With higher SLR
scenarios and in the case of no further development at the coast,
SLR may become the dominant driver before the end of this century.

"Another rarely considered factor is the shift in TC climatology which
also plays a critical role in explaining changes in fluvial suspended
sediment loads to deltas as demonstrated by Darby et al. (2016), again
for the Mekong delta. More generally, most conventional engineering
strategies that are commonly employed to reduce flood risk (including
levees, sea walls, and dams) disrupt a delta’s natural mechanisms for
building land. These approaches are rather short-term solutions which
overall reduce the long-term resilience of deltas (Tessler et al., 2015;
Welch et al., 2017). Systems particularly prone to flood risk due to
anthropogenic activities include North America’s Mississippi River
delta, Europe's Rhine River delta, and deltas in East Asia (Renaud et al.,
2013; Day et al, 2016). In regions where suspended sediments are
still available in relatively large quantities, rates of sedimentation can
vary depending on multiple factors, including the type of infrastructure
present locally, as was shown by Rogers and Overeem (2017) for the
Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (Bengal) delta in Bangladesh as well
as seasonal differences in sediment supply and place of deposition.
For example, in meso-tidal and macro-tidal estuaries, during floods
most of the sediments are depositing in the coastal zones and a large
part of these sediments are brought back to the estuary during the
low flow season by tidal pumping. This can lead to significantly higher
deposition rates in the dry season as shown by Lefebvre et al. (2012)
in the lower Red River estuary and by Gugliotta et al. (2018) in the
Mekong delta. Enhanced sedimentation further upstream in estuaries
and a silting-up of estuarine navigation channels can have high
economic consequences for cities with a large estuarine harbour. In
Haiphong city, in North Vietnam, the authorities decided to build a
new harbour further downstream, for a cost estimated at 2 billion USD
(Duy Vinh et al., 2018).

the coastline, particularly in terms of water and sediment budgets

over short periods of time, outpacing the effects of SLR and leading
to increased exposure and vulnerability of social-ecological systems
(high confidence). Without losing sight of this fact, management of
catchment-level processes contribute to limiting rapid increases in
exposure and vulnerability. Further to hinterland influences, coastal
squeeze increases coastal exposure as well as vulnerability by the
loss of a buffer zone between the sea and infrastructure behind
the habitat undergoing coastal squeeze. The clear implication is
that coastal ecosystems progressively lose their ability to provide
regulating services with respect to coastal hazards, including as
a defence against SLR driven inundation and salinisation (high
confidence). Vulnerability is also increased if freshwater resources
become salinised, particularly if these resources are already scarce.
The exposure and vulnerability of human communities is exacerbated
by the loss of other provisioning, supporting and cultural services
generated by coastal ecosystems, which is especially problematic for
coast-dependent communities (high confidence).

"IK and LK contribute both as a foundation for and an outcome of
customary resource management systems aimed at regulating
resource use and securing critical ecosystem protection (examples
in Indonesia; Hiwasaki et al., 2015), structuring the relationship
between people and authorities, and framing and maintaining a
strong sense of place in the community (examples in Timor Leste;
Hiwasaki et al., 2015). In turn, this allows local communities to
predict and prepare for both sudden shock events that have historical
precedent and, when IK and LK are embedded in day-to-day rituals
and decision making processes, to also anticipate the consequences
of gradual changes, as in sea level (examples in Indonesia; Hiwasaki

IK and elders’ leadership — for instance, Rahui in French Polynesia
(Gharasian, 2016), or Mo in the Marshall Islands (Bridges and
McClatchey, 2009) — also allow communities to diversify access to
marine and terrestrial resources using seasonal calendars, to ensure
collective food and water security, and to maintain ecological
integrity (McMillen et al., 2014). In rural Pacific atolls, traditional
food preservation and storage (e.g., storing germinated coconuts
or drying fish) still play a role in anticipating disruptions in natural
resource availability (Campbell, 2015; Lazrus, 2015). Such practices
have enabled the survival of isolated communities from the Arctic
to tropical islands in constraining sea environments for centuries
to millennia (McMillen et al., 2014; Nunn et al., 2017a). Morrison
(2017) argues that IK and LK can also play a role in supporting
internal migration in response to SLR, by avoiding social and cultural

"While some studies have begun to highlight the influence of the

how risk perceptions vary across different geographical and social
contexts, and how this influences exposure and vulnerability to
coastal hazards (e.g., Terpstra, 2011; van der Linden, 2015). There
is a critical lack of studies specifically addressing SLR. Some recent
works conducted in coastal Australia suggest that while people are
confident about their ability to cope with an already experienced
event, when it comes to SLR, the dominant narrative is articulated
around the barriers related to the ‘uncertainty in the nature and
scale of the impacts as well as the response options available’
(Elrick-Barr et al., 2017, p. 1147). Similar conclusions have been
highlighted in the Caribbean islands of St. Vincent (Smith, 2018) and
the Bahamas (Thomas and Benjamin, 2018). SLR is rarely addressed
separately from sea-related extreme events, which masks a crucial
difference between already-observed and delayed impacts. Climate
change is considered a “distant psychological risk” (Spence et al.,
2012), making it and SLR per se ‘markedly different from the way
that our ancestors have traditionally perceived threats in their local

coastal hazards (Aldrich, 2017; Petzold, 2018). Although the term is
subject to debate (Meyer, 2018), social capital — that is, the level
of cohesion between individuals, between groups of individuals, and
between people and institutions, within and between communities —
is considered to be a key enabler for collective action to reduce risk
and build adaptive capacity (Adger, 2010; Aldrich and Meyer, 2015;
Petzold and Ratter, 2015). Levels of social capital can be influenced
by underlying social processes, such as socioeconomic (in)equalities,
gender issues, health, social networks and social media. It applies
to both developing and developed countries, for example in densely
populated deltas (Jordan, 2015), European coasts (Jones and Clark,
2014; Petzold, 2016), Asian urban or semi-urban coastal areas (Lo
et al., 2015; Triyanti et al., 2017) and Pacific islands (Neef et al., 2018).
Social capital framed as an enabler for reducing vulnerability has been
studied in the context of extreme events (risk prevention mechanisms,
emergency responses and post-crisis actions) and collective
environmental management (e.g., replanting mangroves, beach
cleaning, etc.). Social capital also enables adaptation prospects. For
example, its role has been explored in public acceptability of long-term
coastal adaptation policies in the UK (ones and Clark, 2014; Jones
et al., 2015). The role of social capital in building resilience to climate
stress in coastal Bangladesh was explored by Jordan (2015), who
found complex and even contradictory interactions between social
capital and resilience to climate stress. Among others, Jordan (2015)
also advises caution about uncritical importation of such Westernised
concepts in seeking to understand and address coastal vulnerability
in developing countries.

currently acts as a ‘background driver’, with extreme events, changes
in wave patterns, tides and human intervention often described as
the prevailing drivers of observed changes (Grady et al., 2013; Albert

impacts of SLR, such as coastal flooding (Pollard et al., 2018). Despite
the complexity of the attribution issue (Romine et al., 2013; Le

signs of the direct influence of recent SLR on shoreline behaviour,

"New coastal flood risk studies conducted since AR4 at global,
continental and city scale, reinforce AR5 findings that if coastal
societies do not adapt, flood risks will increase by 2-3 orders of

2100, with expected annual damages (EAD) amounting to 0.3-9.3%
of global GDP. Assessing 120 cities globally, Abadie (2018) find that

currently dominate over land gains and that human interventions are

of protection and retreat under RCP8.5 in 2050 has been estimated

small island states such as the Marshall Islands (7.6%), the Maldives

on a global average and for urban and densely populated regions,
hard protection is highly cost efficient with benefit-cost ratios up
to 104, but for poorer and less densely populated areas benefit-cost
ratios are generally smaller than one (Lincke and Hinkel, 2018). Hence,
without substantial transfer payments supporting poor areas, coastal
flood risks will evolve unequally during this century, with richer and
densely populated areas well protected behind hard structures and
poorer less densely populated areas suffering losses and damages,

"Since AR5, however, there is growing appreciation and understanding
of the ability of coastal systems to respond dynamically to SLR (Passeri
etal. 2015; Lentz et al., 2016; Deng et al., 2017). Most low-lying coastal
systems exhibit important feedbacks between biological and physical
processes (e.g., Wright and Nichols, 2018), that have allowed them
to maintain a relatively stable morphology under moderate rates of
SLR (<0.3 cm yr“) over the past few millennia (Woodruff et al., 2013;
Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1). In a global review on multi-decadal
changes in the land area of 709 atoll islands, Duvat (2019) shows that
in a context of more rapid SLR than the global mean (Becker et al.,
2012; Palanisamy et al., 2014), 73.1% of islands were stable in area,
while respectively 15.5% and 11.4% increased and decreased in size.
While anthropogenic drivers played a major role, especially in urban
islands (e.g., shoreline stabilisation by coastal defences, increase in
island size as a result of reclamation works), this study and others
(e.g., McLean and Kench, 2015) suggest that these islands have had
the capacity to maintain their land area by naturally adjusting to SLR
over the past decades (high confidence). However, it has been argued
that this capacity could be reduced in the coming decades, due to the
combination of higher rates of SLR, increased wave energy (Albert et al.,
2016), changes in run-up (Shope et al., 2017) and storm wave direction
(Harley et al., 2017), effects of ocean warming and acidification on
critical ecosystems such as coral reefs (Section 4.3.3.5.2), and a
continued increase in anthropogenic pressure.

"From a global scale perspective, based on AR4 SLR scenarios and
without considering the potential benefits of adaptation, Hinkel et al.
(2013b) estimate that about 6000 to 17,000 km? of land is expected
to be lost during the 21st century due to enhanced coastal erosion
associated with SLR, in combination with other drivers. This could
lead to a displacement of 1.6-5.3 million people and associated
cumulative costs of 300 to 1000 billion USD (Section 4.4.3.5).
Importantly, these global figures mask the wide diversity of local
situations; and some literature is emerging on the non-physical and
non-quantifiable impacts of coastal erosion, for example, on the loss
of recreational grounds and the induced risks to the associated social
dimensions (i.e., how local communities experience coastal erosion

"These changes will affect both freshwater availability (for drinking
water supply and agriculture) and vegetation dynamics. At many
locations, however, direct anthropogenic influences, such as
groundwater pumping for agricultural or urban uses, already impact
salinisation of coastal aquifers more strongly than what is expected
from SLR in the 21st century (Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012; Jiménez
Cisneros et al., 2014; Uddameri et al., 2014), with trade-offs in terms
of groundwater depletion that may contribute to anthropogenic
subsidence and thus increase coastal flood risk. Recent studies also
suggest that the influence of land-surface inundation on seawater
intrusion and resulting salinisation of groundwater lenses on
small islands has been underestimated until now (Ataie-Ashtiani

"direct (increased salinity) and indirect way (altered environmental
conditions which change the behaviour of pollutants and microbes).
In terms of direct impacts, statistical models and long-term (1950 to
present) records of salinity show significant upward trends in salinity
and a positive correlation between rising sea levels and increasing
residual salinity, for example in the Delaware Estuary, USA (Ross
et al., 2015). Higher salinity levels, further inland, have also been
reported in the Gorai river basin, southwestern Bangladesh (Bhuiyan
and Dutta, 2012), and in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. In the Mekong
Delta for instance, salinity intrusion extends around 15 km inland
during the rainy season and typically around 50 km during dry season
(Gugliotta et al., 2017). Importantly, salinity intrusion in these deltas
is caused by a variety of factors such as changes in discharge and
water abstraction along with relative SLR. More broadly, the impact
of salinity intrusion can be significant in river deltas or low-lying
wetlands, especially during low-flow periods such as in the dry season
(Dessu et al., 2018). In Bangladesh, for instance, some freshwater fish
species are expected to lose their habitat with increasing salinity, with
profound consequences on fish-dependent communities (Dasgupta
et al, 2017). In the Florida Coastal Everglades, sea level increasingly
exceeds ground surface elevation at the most downstream freshwater
sites, affecting marine-to-freshwater hydrologic connectivity and
transport of salinity and phosphorous upstream from the Gulf of
Mexico. The impact of SLR is higher in the dry season when there
is practically no freshwater inflow (Dessu et al., 2018). Salinity
intrusion was shown to cause shifts in the diatom assemblages,
with expected cascading effects through the food web (Mazzei and
Gaiser, 2018). Salinisation of surface water may lead to limitations
in drinking water supply (Wilbers et al., 2014), as well as to future
fresh water shortage in reservoirs, for example in Shanghai (Li et al.,
2015). Salinity changes the partitioning and mobility of some metals,
and hence their concentration or speciation in the water bodies
(Noh et al., 2013; Wong et al., 2015; de Souza Machado et al., 2018).
Varying levels of salinity also influence the abundance and toxicity of
Vibrio cholerae in the Ganges Delta (Batabyal et al., 2016).

alterations in drainage and sediment supply. (Sections 4.3.2.3, 5.3.2).
Potentially one of the most important of the eco-morphodynamic
feedbacks allowing for relatively stable morphology under SLR is the
ability of marsh and mangrove systems to enhance the trapping of
sediment, which in turn allows tidal wetlands to grow and increase
the production and accumulation of organic material (Kirwan and
Megonigal, 2013). When ecosystem health is maintained and
sufficient sediment exists to support their growth, this particular
feedback has generally allowed marshes and mangrove systems to
build vertically at rates equal to or greater than SLR up to the present
day (Kirwan et al., 2016; Woodroffe et al., 2016).

"While recent reviews suggest that mangroves’ surface accretion
rate will keep pace with a high SLR scenario (RCP8.5) up to years
2055 and 2070 in fringe and basin mangrove settings, respectively
(Sasmito et al. 2016), process-based models of vertical marsh
growth that incorporate biological and physical feedbacks support
survival under rates of SLR as high as 1-5 cm yr""! before drowning
(Kirwan et al., 2016). Threshold rates of SLR before marsh drowning
however vary significantly from site-to-site and can be substantially
lower than 1 cm yr in micro-tidal regions where the tidal trapping
of sediment is reduced and/or in areas with low sediment availability
(Lovelock et al., 2015; Ganju et al., 2017; Jankowski et al., 2017;
Watson et al., 2017). Global environmental change may also to lead
to changes in growth rates, productivity and geographic distribution
of different mangrove and marsh species, including the replacement
of environmentally sensitive species by those possessing greater
climatic tolerance (Krauss et al., 2014; Reef and Lovelock, 2014;
Coldren et al., 2019). Processes impacting lateral changes at the
marsh boundary including wave erosion are just as important, if not
more, than vertical accretion rates in determining coastal wetland
survival (e.g., Mariotti and Carr, 2014). For most low-lying coastlines,
a seaward loss of wetland area due to marsh retreat could be offset
by a similar landward migration of coastal wetlands (Kirwan and
Megonigal, 2013; Schile et al., 2014), this landward migration having

"Coral reefs are considered to be the marine ecosystem most
threatened by climate-related ocean change, especially ocean
warming and acidification, even under an RCP2.6 scenario (Gattuso
et al., 2015; Albright et al., 2018; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018; Diaz
et al., 2019; Section 5.3.4). ARS concluded that ‘a number of coral
reefs could [...] keep up with the maximum rate of SLR of 15.1 mm
yr projected for the end of the century [...] (medium confidence)
[but a future net accretion rate lower] than during the Holocene
(Perry et al, 2013) and increased turbidity (Storlazzi et al., 2011)
will weaken this capability (very high confidence)’ (Wong et al.,
2014: 379). Subsequently, some studies suggested that SLR may
have negligible impacts on coral reefs’ vertical growth because the
projected rate and magnitude of SLR by 2100 are within the potential
accretion rates of most coral reefs (van Woesik et al., 2015). Other
studies, however, stressed that the overall net vertical accretion of
reefs may decrease after the first 30 years of rise in a 1.2 m SLR
scenario (Hamylton et al., 2014), and that most reefs will not be able
to keep up with SLR under RCP4.5 and beyond (Perry et al., 2018). The
SR1.5 also concludes that coral reefs ‘are projected to decline by a
further 70-90% at 1.5°C (high confidence) with larger losses (>99%)
at 2°C (very high confidence)’ (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018: 10).A key
point is that SLR will not act in isolation of other drivers. Cumulative
impacts, including anthropogenic drivers, are estimated to reduce the
ability of coral reefs to keep pace with future SLR (Hughes et al.,
2017; Yates et al., 2017) and thereby reduce the capacity of reefs to
provide sediments and protection to coastal areas. For example, the
combination of reef erosion due to acidification and human-induced
mechanical destruction is altering seafloor topography, increasing
risks from SLR in carbonate sediment dominated regions (Yates et al.,
2017). Both ocean acidification (Albright et al., 2018; Eyre et al., 2018)
and ocean warming (Perry and Morgan, 2017) have been considered
to slow future growth rates and reef accretion (Section 5.3.4). Recent
literature also shows that alterations of coral reef 3D structure from
changes in growth, breakage, disease or acidification can profoundly
affect their ability to buffer waves impacts (through wave breaking
and wave energy damping), and therefore keep-up with SLR (Yates
et al, 2017; Harris et al., 2018). Such prospects contribute to raise
concerns about the future ability of atoll islands to adjust naturally
to SLR and persist (Section 4.3.3.3, Cross-Chapter Box 9). Another
concern is that locally, even minimal SLR can increase turbidity on
fringing reefs, reducing light and, therefore, photosynthesis and
calcification. SLR-induced turbidity can be caused by increased
coastal erosion and the transfer of sediment to nearby reefs and
enhanced sediment resuspension (Field et al., 2011).

"While there is little literature on the extent to which SLR specifically
will affect coastal protection by coastal and marine ecosystems, it
is estimated that SLR may reduce this ecosystem service (limited
evidence, high agreement) through the above-described impacts on
the ecosystems themselves, and in combination with the impacts of
other climate-related changes to the ocean (e.g., ocean warming
and acidification; Sections 5.3.1 to 5.3.6, 5.4.1). Wave attenuation
by coral reefs, for example, is estimated to be negatively affected
in the near future by changes in coral reefs’ structural complexity
more than by SLR (Harris et al., 2018); changes in mean and ESL
events will rather add a layer of stress. Beck et al. (2018) estimate
that under RCP8.5 by 2100, a 1 m loss in coral reefs’ height will
increase the global area flooded under a 100-year storm event by
116% compared to today, against +66% with no reef loss.
"	Text
"Due to their natural capacity to enhance accretion and in the
absence of mechanical or chemical destruction by human activities,
seagrasses are not expected to be severely affected by SLR, except
indirectly through the increase of the impacts of extreme weather
events and waves on coastal morphology (i.e., erosion) as well as
through changes in light levels and through effects on adjacent
ecosystems (Saunders et al., 2013). Extreme flooding events have
also been shown to cause large-scale losses of seagrass habitats
(Bandeira and Gell, 2003), for example seagrasses in Queensland,
Australia, were lost in a disastrous flooding event (Campbell and
McKenzie, 2004). Changes in ocean currents can have either positive
or negative effects on seagrasses, creating new space for seagrasses
to grow or eroding seagrass beds (Bjork et al., 2008). But overall,
seagrass will primarily be negatively affected by the direct effects
of increased sea temperature on growth rates and the occurrence
of disease (Marba and Duarte, 2010; Burge et al., 2013; Koch et al.,
2013; Thompson et al., 2015; Chefaoui et al., 2018; Gattuso et al.,
2018; Section 5.3.2) as well as by heavy rains that may dilute the
seawater to a lower salinity. Such impacts will be exacerbated by
major causes of seagrass decline including coastal eutrophication,
siltation and coastal development (Waycott et al., 2009). Noteworthy
is that some positive impacts are expected, as ocean acidification
is expected to benefit photosynthesis and growth rates of seagrass
(Repolho et al., 2017).
"	Text
"Major ‘protection’ benefits derived from the above-mentioned coastal
ecosystems include wave attenuation and shoreline stabilisation,
for example, by coral reefs (Elliff and Silva, 2017; Siegle and Costa,
2017), mangroves (Zhang et al., 2012; Barbier, 2016; Menéndez et al.,
2018) or salt marshes (Méller et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2015). Recently,
a global meta-analysis of 69 studies demonstrated that, on average,
these ecosystems together reduced wave heights between 35-71%
at the limited locations considered (Narayan et al., 2016), with coral
reefs, salt marshes, mangroves and seagrass/kelp beds reducing wave
heights by 54-81%, 62-79%, 25-37% and 25-45% respectively
(see Narayan et al., 2016 for map of locations considered). Additional
studies suggest greater wave attenuation in mangrove systems
(Horstman et al., 2014), and highlight broader complexities in wave
attenuation related to total tidal wetland extent, water depth, and
species. Global analyses show that natural and artificial seagrasses
can attenuate wave height and energy by as much as 40% and 50%,
respectively (Fonseca and Cahalan, 1992; John et al., 2015), while
coral reefs have been observed to reduce total wave energy by 94—
98% (n = 13; Ferrario et al., 2014) and wave driven flooding volume
by 72% (Beetham et al., 2017). In addition, storm surge attenuation
based on a recent literature review by Stark et al. (2015) range from
-2-25 cm km™ length of marsh, where the negative value denotes
actual amplification. Other ecosystems provide coastal protection,
including macroalgae, oyster and mussel beds, and also beaches,
dunes and barrier islands, but there is less understanding of the
level of protection conferred by these other organisms and habitats
(Spalding et al., 2014).

"SLR will affect agriculture mainly through land submergence, soil
and fresh groundwater resources salinisation, and land loss due
to permanent coastal erosion, with consequences on production,
livelihood diversification and food security, especially in heavily
coastal agriculture-dependent countries such as Bangladesh
(Khanom, 2016). Recent literature confirms that salinisation is
already a major problem for traditional agriculture in deltas (Wong
et al, 2014; Khai et al., 2018) and low-lying island nations where
some edible cultivated plants such as taro patches are threatened
(Nunn et al., 2017b). Taking the case of rice cultivation, recent works
emphasise the prevailing role of combined surface elevation and soil
salinity, such as in the Mekong delta (Vietnam; Smajgl et al., 2015)
and in the Ebro delta (Spain; Genua-Olmedo et al., 2016), estimating
for the latter a decrease in the rice production index from 61.2% in
2010 to 33.8% by 2100 in a 1.8 m SLR scenario. For seven wetland
species occurring in coastal freshwater marshes in central Veracruz
on the Gulf of Mexico, an increase in salinity was shown to affect the
germination process under wetland salt intrusion (Sanchez-Garcia
et al, 2017). In coastal Bangladesh, oilseed, sugarcane and
jute cultivation was reported to be already discontinued due to
challenges to cope with current salinity levels (Khanom, 2016), and
salinity is projected to have an unambiguously negative influence
on all dry-season crops over the next 15-45 years (especially in the
southwest; Clarke et al., 2018; Kabir et al., 2018). Salinity intrusion
and salinisation can trigger land use changes towards brackish or
saline aquaculture such as shrimp or rice-shrimp systems with
impacts on environment, livelihoods and income stability (Renaud
et al., 2015). However, increasing salinity is only one of the land use
change drivers along with, for example, policy changes and market
prices at the household level (Renaud et al., 2015).

"Recent studies support the AR5 conclusion that ocean warming and
acidification are considered more influential drivers of change in
fisheries and aquaculture than SLR (Larsen et al., 2014; Nurse et al.,

and aquaculture are indirect, through adverse impacts on habitats
(eg., coral reef degradation, reduced water quality in deltas and
estuarine environments, soil salinisation, etc.), as well as on facilities
(eg., damage to small and large harbours). This makes future
projections on SLR implications for coastal and marine fisheries and
aquaculture an understudied field of research. Conclusions only

manifestations of SLR and local fishery-dependent communities’
ability to adapt to alterations in fish and aquaculture conditions and

human/cultural impacts’ importance for and distribution within a
given society (Fatori¢ and Seekamp, 2017b). This field of research
(no detailed mention found in AR5) is just emerging due to the
transdisciplinary and qualitative nature of the topic. Graham et al.
(2013) advance a 5-category framing of social values specifically at
risk from SLR: health (i.e., the social determinants of survival such as
environmental and housing quality and healthy lifestyles), feeling of
safety (e.g., financial and job security), belongingness (i.e., attachment
to places and people), self-esteem (e.g., social status or pride that can
be affected by coastal retreat), and self-actualisation (ie., people's
efforts to define their own identity). Another emerging issue relates
to social values at risk due to land submergence in low-lying islands
(Yamamoto and Esteban, 2014) and parts of countries and individual
properties (Marino, 2012; Maldonado et al., 2013; Aerts, 2017;
Allgood and McNamara, 2017). Recent studies also highlight the
potential additional risks to social values in areas where displaced
people relocate (Davis et al., 2018).

Future changes in climatic conditions in tourists’ areas of origin will

of climate-related changes (Shakeela and Becken, 2015). Since AR5,
forecasting the consequences of climate change effects on global-to-
local tourism flows has remained challenging (Rossello-Nadal, 2014;
Wong et al., 2014; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018). There are also
concerns about the effect of SLR on tourism facilities, for example
hotels in Ghana (Sagoe-Addy and Addo, 2013), in a context where
tourism infrastructure often contributes to the degradation of
natural buffering environments through, for example, coastal
squeeze (e.g., Section 4.3.2.4) and human-driven coastal erosion.
Again, forecasting is constrained by the lack of scientific studies on
tourism stakeholders’ long-term strategies and adaptive capacity

"SLR projections for the 21st century, together with other ocean
related changes (e.g., acidification and warming) and the possible
increase in human-driven pressures at the coast (e.g., demographic
and settlement patterns), make low-lying islands, coasts and
communities relevant illustrations of some of the five Reasons for
Concern (RFCs) developed by the IPCC since the Third Assessment
Report (McCarthy et al., 2001; Smith et al., 2001) to assess risks from
a global perspective. The AR5 Synthesis Report (IPCC, 2014) as well
as the more recent SR1.5 (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018) refined the
RFC approach. The ARS Synthesis Report (IPCC, 2014) developed two
additional RFCs related to the coasts, subsequently updated along
with the other RFCs (O'Neill et al., 2017). One refers to risks to marine
species arising from ocean acidification, and the other one refers to
risks to human and natural systems from SLR. Despite the difficulty in
attributing observed impacts to SLR per se (Section 4.3.3.1), O'Neill
et al. (2017) estimate that risks related to SLR are already detectable
globally and will increase rapidly, so that high risk may occur before
a 1m rise level is reached. O'Neill et al. (2017) also suggest that
limits to coastal protection and EbA by 2100 could occur in a 1 m
SLR rise scenario. Previous assessments however left gaps, including
quantifying the benefits from adaptation in terms of risk reduction.

"Risks considered — \n line with the AR5 (IPCC, 2014), current and
future risks result from the interaction of SLR-related hazards with
the vulnerability of exposed ecosystems and societies. According
to the specific scope of the chapter, this assessment focusses on
the additional risks due to SLR and does not account for changes
in extreme event climatology. Hazards considered are coastal
flooding (Section 4.3.4.2), erosion (Section 4.3.4.3) and salinisation
(Section 4.3.4.4). The proxies used to describe exposure and
vulnerability are the density of assets at the coast (Section 4.3.2.2)
and the level of degradation of natural buffering by marine and
terrestrial ecosystems (Sections 4.3.2.3, 4.3.3.5.4, and 5.3.2 to

at the coast, including populations, infrastructures and livelihoods.
Specific metrics were developed (see $M4.3 for details), and their
contribution to present-day observed impacts and to end-century risk
have been assessed based on the authors’ expert judgment and a
methodological grid presented in SM4.3 (SM4.3.1 to SM4.3.6). The

of the geographies considered (Panel B in Figure 4.3), and that risk is
expected to increase over this century in virtually all low-lying coastal
areas whatever their context-specificities or nature (island/continental,
developed/developing county) (Cross-Chapter Box 9). In the absence
of high adaptation (bars (A)), risk is expected to significantly increase
in urban atoll islands and the selected Arctic coastal communities
even in a SROCC RCP2.6 scenario, and all geographies are expected
to experience almost high to very high risks at the upper /ikely range
of SROCC RCP8.5. These results allow refining AR5 conclusions by
showing, first, that high risk can indeed occur before the 1m rise

"Sea level rise scenarios — Based on the updates for ranges and
mean values developed in this chapter (Section 4.2, Table 4.3), this
assessment considers the end-century GMSL (2100) relative to 1986—
2005 levels for two scenarios, SROCC RCP2.6 and SROCC RCP8.5.
Both mean values and the SROCC RCP8.5 upper end of the likely range
are used to assess risk transitions (Figure 4.3, Panel A). For the sake
of readability, the following values were used: 43 cm (mean SROCC
RCP2.6), 84 cm (mean SROCC RCP8.5) and 110 cm (SROCC RCP8.5
upper end of likely range). While GMSL serves as a representation of
different possible climate change scenarios (see Panel A in Figure 4.3,
Section 4.1.2), the assessment of additional risks due to SLR
on specific geographies is developed against end-century relative SLR
(RSL) in order to allow a geographically accurate approach (Panel B,
Figure 4.3). Accordingly, risk was assessed to illustrative geographies
based on RSLs for each of the two SROCC RCP scenarios and each
of the real-world case studies to (SM4.3.6 and Table SM4.3.2; see
dotted lines in Panel B of Figure 4.3). RSL observations include some
or all of the following VLMs: both uplift (e.g., due to tectonics) and
subsidence due to natural (e.g., tectonics, sediment compaction)
and human (e.g., oil/gas/water extraction, mining activities) factors,
as well as to GIA. However, in SROCC, numerical RSL projections
only include GIA and the regional gravitational, rotational, and
deformational responses (GRD, see Section 4.2.1.5) to ice mass loss.

"Adaptation scenarios — Risk will also depend on the effectiveness
of coastal societies’ responses to both extreme events and slow onset
changes. To capture the response dimension, four metrics have been
considered that refer to the implementation of adequately calibrated
hard, engineered coastal defences (Section 4.4.2.2), the restoration
of the degraded ecosystems or the creation of new natural buffers
areas (Section 4.4.2.2 and 4.4.2.3), planned and local-scale relocation
(Section 4.4.2.6), and measures to limit human-induced subsidence
(Sections 4.4.2.2, 4.4.2.5). On these bases, two contrasting adaptation
scenarios were considered. The first one is called ‘No-to-moderate
response’ (see (A) bars in Panel B, Figure 4.3) and represents a
business-as-usual scenario where no major additional adaptation
efforts compared to today are implemented. That is, neither
substantial intensification of current actions nor new types of actions,
e.g., only moderate raising of existing protections in high-density
areas or sporadic episodes of relocation or beach nourishment where
largescale efforts are not already underway. The second one, called
‘Maximum potential response’ (bars (B) in Figure 4.3), refers to an
ambitious combination of both incremental and transformational
adaptation (ie., significantly upscaled effort); for example, relocation
of entire districts or raised protections in some cities, or creation/
restoration at a significant scale of beach-dune systems including
indigenous vegetation.

"The controlling factors of urban atoll islands’ future habitability are
the density of assets exposed to marine flooding and coastal erosion
(SM4.3.8.2), future trends in these hazards, and ecosystem response
to both ocean-climate related pressures and human activities. Urban
atoll islands already experience coastal flooding, for example,
in Male’ (Wadey et al., 2017) and Funafuti (Yamano et al., 2007;
McCubbin et al., 2015). Coastal erosion is also a major concern along
non-armoured shoreline in South Tarawa (Duvat et al., 2013) and
Fongafale (Onaka et al., 2017), but not in Male’ where surrounding
fortifications have extended along almost the entire shoreline
from several decades (Naylor, 2015). Salinisation already affects
groundwater lenses, but its contribution to risk varies from one case
to another, from low in Male’ (relying on desalinised seawater) to
important for human consumption and agriculture in South Tarawa
(Bailey et al., 2014; Post et al., 2018).

"Together, high population densities (from ~3,200 people per km? in
South Tarawa to ~65,700 people per km? in Male’) (Government of the
Maldives, 2014; Mclver et al., 2015) and the concentration of critical
infrastructure and settlements in naturally low-lying flood-prone areas
already substantially contribute to coastal risk (Duvat et al., 2013; Field
et al, 2017). Even stabilised densities in the future would translate
into a substantial increase of risk under a 43cm GMSL rise. Risk will
also be exacerbated by the negative effects of ocean warming and
acidification, especially on coral reef and mangrove capacity to cope
with SLR (Pendleton et al, 2016; Van Hooidonk et al., 2016; Perry and
Morgan, 2017; Perry et al., 2018) (Sections 4.3.3.5, 5.3). In addition,
even small values of SLR will significantly increase risk to atoll islands’
aquifers (Bailey et al., 2016; Storlazzi et al., 2018). Finally, land scarcity
in atoll environments will exacerbate the importance of SLR induced
damages (on housing, agriculture and infrastructure especially)
and cascading impacts (on livelihoods, for example, as a result of
groundwater and soil salinisation).

economic activities and critical infrastructure (airports, main
harbours). They illustrate the prominence of anthropogenic-driven
disturbances to marine and terrestrial ecosystems (e.g., mangrove
clearing in South Tarawa or human-induced coral reef degradation
through land reclamation in Male’; Duvat et al, 2013; Naylor, 2015)
and therefore to services such as coastal protection delivered by the
coral reef (i.e., wave energy attenuation that reduces flooding and
erosion, and sediment provision that contributes to island persistence

"Large tropical agricultural deltas (SM4.3.8.3, Panel B in
Figure 4.3) — River deltas considered in this analysis are the Mekong
Delta and the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna Delta. Both deltas
are large, low-lying and dominated by agricultural production. The
risk assessment to SLR considered the entire delta area (not only
the coastal fringe; see SM4.3.6 for explanation). High population
densities (1280 people per km? and 433 people per km? in the
Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna and Mekong deltas, respectively)
(Ericson et al., 2006; Government of the Maldives, 2014) and the
removal of natural vegetation buffers contribute to high exposure
rates to coastal flooding, erosion, and salinisation. Agricultural
production contributes to GDP strongly (Smajgl et al., 2015; Hossain
et al, 2018), making agricultural fields important assets. In both
deltas, mangroves are partially degraded (Ghosh et al., 2018;
Veettil et al., 2018) as well as other wetlands at the coast and
further inland (Quan et al., 2018a; Rahman et al., 2018). Currently,
riverine flooding dominates in both deltas (Auerbach et al., 2015;
Rahman and Rahman, 2015; Ngan et al., 2018). However, high tides
and cyclones can generate large coastal flooding events, especially
in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna Delta (Auerbach et al., 2015;

the likelihood of flooding in both deltas (Brown et al., 2018b).

GMSL rise and ESL events characterise coastal megacities (Hanson
et al, 2011). These are high concentrations of income and wealth
in geographic terms but within relatively small area exhibit large
distributional differences of both with important implications for
emergency response and adaptation. Concentration translates into
high exposure of monetary value to coastal hazards and the cities
noted here have both historical and recent experience with damaging
ESL events, such as Typhoon Winnie which struck Shanghai in 1997
(Xian et al., 2018), Hurricane Sandy in New York in 2012 (Rosenzweig
and Solecki, 2014), and the North Sea storm of 1953 which impacted
the Rotterdam area (Gerritsen, 2005; Jonkman et al., 2008). However,
high density, limited space and high cost of land leads to development
of below-ground space for transportation (e.g., subways, road
tunnels; MTA, 2017) and storage, and even habitation, creating
vulnerabilities not seen in low-density areas. Natural ecosystems
within the megacity boundaries and nearby have been exploited for
centuries and in some cases decimated or even extirpated (Hartig
et al, 2002). Accordingly, they provide limited benefits in terms of
coastal protection for the densest part of these cities but can be
critically important for protection of lower-density areas, for example,
wetlands and sandy beaches in the Jamaica Bay/Rockaway sector of
New York that protect nearby residential communities (Hartig et al.,
2002). Space limitations also constrain the potential benefits of EbA
measures. Instead, resource-rich coastal cities depend largely on
hard defences like sea walls and surge barriers for coastal protection
(Section 4.4.2.2). Such defences are costly but generally cost effective
due to the aforementioned concentration of population and value.
However, barriers to planning and implementing adaptation include
governance challenges (Section 4.4.2) such as limited control over
finances and the intermittent nature of ESLs which inhibit focused
attention over the long time scales needed to plan and implement
hard defences (Section 4.4.2.2). As a result, coastal adaptation for
resource-rich cities is uneven and the three presented here were
selected with a view toward exhibiting a range of current and
potential future effectiveness.

"Permafrost thaw is already accelerating due to increasing ground
temperatures that weaken the mechanical stability of frozen ground
(Section 3.4.2.2). Arctic SLR and sea surface warming have the
potential to substantially contribute to this thawing (Forbes, 2011;
Barnhart et al., 2014b; Lamoureux et al., 2015; Fritz et al., 2017).
An additional factor unique to the polar regions is the decrease
in seasonal sea ice extent in the Arctic (Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2),
which together with a lengthening open water season, provides less
protection from storm impacts, particularly later in the year when
storms are prevalent (Forbes, 2011; Lantuit et al., 2011; Barnhart
et al., 2014; Melvin et al. 2017; Fang et al., 2018; Forbes, 2019) and

"Accelerating permafrost thaw is promoting rapid erosion of ice-rich
sediments, e.g., at Bykovsky (Myers, 2005; Lantuit et al. 2011;
Vanderlinden et al., 2018) and Tuktoyaktuk (Lamoureux et al., 2015;
Ford et al, 2016a). Related to this, Kivalina, Shishmaref, Shingle
Point, Tuktoyaktuk, and parts of the Lena delta (less so for Bykovsky)
are already facing high risk of flooding. Shishmaref, for example,
experienced 10 flooding events between 1973 and 2015 that resulted
in emergency declarations (Bronen and Chapin, 2013; Lamoureux
et al., 2015; Irrgang et al., 2019). There is however no evidence of
salinisation in the selected communities, but brackish water flooding
of the outer Mackenzie Delta caused by a 1999 storm surge (a rare
event due to upwelling ahead of the storm) led to widespread die-off
of vegetation with negative ecosystem impacts (Pisaric et al., 2011;
Kokelj et al., 2012).

"Arctic communities (SM4.3.8.4, Panel B in Figure 4.3) — Five small
indigenous settlements located on the Arctic Coastal Plain are
considered in this analysis: Bykovsky (Lena Delta, Russian Federation),
Shishmaref and Kivalina (Alaska, USA), and Shingle Point and
Tuktoyaktuk (Mackenzie Delta, Canada). They lie on exposed coasts
composed of unlithified ice-rich sediments in permafrost, in areas
with seasonal sea ice and slow to moderate SLR. These communities
have populations ranging from 380 to 900 (fewer and seasonal at
Shingle Point) that are heavily dependent on marine subsistence
resources (Forbes, 2011; Ford et al., 2016a). Shishmaref and Kivalina
are located on low-lying barrier islands highly susceptible to rising
sea level (Marino, 2012; Bronen and Chapin, 2013; Fang et al., 2018;
Rolph et al., 2018). Shingle Point is situated on an active gravel spit;
Tuktoyaktuk is built on low ground with high concentrations of
massive ice; and Bykovsky is mostly situated on an ice-rich eroding
terrace about 20 m above sea level. All the selected communities are
remote from regions of rapid positive GIA; many other areas in the
Arctic experience rapid GIA uplift James et al., 2015; Forbes et al.,
2018) and have very low sensitivity to SLR, which may in fact help to
reduce shoaling.

"The assessment also shows that benefits in terms of risk reduction
over this century are to be expected from ambitious adaptation efforts
(bars (B), Sections 4.4.2, 4.4.3 and 4.4.3). In the case of resource-rich
coastal cities especially, adequately engineered coastal defences can
play a decisive role in reducing risk (Section 4.4.2.2, Box 4.1), for
example from high to moderate at the SROCC RCP8.5 upper /ikely
range. In other contexts, such as atoll islands for example, while
engineered protection structures will reduce risk of flooding, they will
not necessarily prevent seawater infiltration due to the permeable
nature of the island substratum. So even adequate coastal protection
would not eliminate risk (SM4.3.8.3). In urban atoll islands, large
tropical agricultural deltas and the selected Arctic communities,
ambitious adaptation efforts mixing adequate coastal defences, the
restoration and creation of buffering ecosystems (e.g., coral reefs),
and a moderate amount of relocation are expected to reduce risk. For
resource-rich coastal cities, adequately engineered hard protection
can virtually eliminate risk of flooding up to 84 cm except for
residual risk of structural failure (Sections 4.4.2 to 4.4.5). Benefits
are relatively important in a 84 cm SLR scenario, as they reduce
tisk from high-to-very-high to moderate-to-high (atolls, Arctic) and
from moderate-to-high to moderate (deltas). These benefits become
more modest when approaching the upper /ikely range of SROCC
RCP8.5, and risk tends to return to high-to-very-high (atolls, Arctic)
levels once the 110 cm rise in sea level is reached. Noteworthy in
urban atoll islands, intensified proactive coastal relocation (e.g.,
relocation of buildings and infrastructures that are very close to the
shoreline) is expected to play a substantial role in risk reduction

well as salinity intrusion, which is impacting coastal aquifers, soils
and surface waters (Anthony et al., 2015; Brown and Nicholls, 2015;
Li et al., 2017). Salinisation of water and soil resources remains a
coastal phenomenon (Smajgl et al., 2015), but salinity intrusion can
reach far inland in some extreme years and significantly contribute
to risk at the delta scale (Section 4.3.3.4.2). Both deltas are partly
protected with hard engineered defences such as dikes and sluice
gates to prevent riverine flooding, and polders and dikes in some
coastal stretches to prevent salinity intrusion and storm surges
(Smajgl et al, 2015; Rogers and Overeem, 2017; Warner et al.,
2018a). Today, in both deltas, the measures implemented to restore
natural buffers are still limited to mangroves ecosystems (Quan et al.,
2018a; Rahman et al., 2018), and the measures aiming at reducing
subsidence are underdeveloped (Schmidt, 2015; Schmitt et al.,
2017). Assuming stable population densities in the future, coastal
flooding will contribute increasingly to risk at the delta level (Brown
and Nicholls, 2015; Brown et al., 2018a; Dang et al., 2018). Coastal
erosion will increase (Anthony et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2017a; Uddin
et al., 2019) and salinisation of coastal waters and soils will be more
significant (Tran Anh et al., 2018; Vu et al., 2018; Rakib et al., 2019)
and will strongly impact agriculture and water supply for the entire
delta Viang et al., 2018; Timsina et al., 2018; Nhung et al. 2019).
Without increased adaptation, coastal ecosystems will be largely
destroyed at 110 cm of SLR (Schmitt et al., 2017; Mehvar et al., 2019;
Mukul et al., 2019). Given the size of these deltas, it is only under
high emission scenarios, that flooding, erosion and salinisation lead
to high risk at the entire delta scale.

pumping systems (Wang et al., 2014; Donchyts et al., 2016).

"Protection reduces coastal risk and impacts by blocking the inland propagation and other effects of mean or extreme sea levels (ESL).
This includes: i) hard protection such as dikes, seawalls, breakwaters, barriers and barrages to protect against flooding, erosion and
salt water intrusion (Nicholls, 2018), ii) sediment-based protection such as beach and shore nourishment, dunes (also referred to as
soft structures), and iii) ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) (see below). The three subcategories are often applied in combination as
so-called hybrid measures. Examples are a marsh green-belt in front of a sea wall, or a sea wall especially designed to include niches
for habitat formation (Coombes et al., 2015).

"under all SLR scenarios. Proactive relocation can indeed compensate
for the increasing extent of coastal flooding and associated damages
(SM4.3.8.3). When taken to the extreme, relocation could lead to the
elimination of risk in situ, for example in the case of the relocation
of the full population of urban atoll islands either elsewhere in
the country (e.g., on another island) or abroad (i.e., international
migration). This is an extreme situation where it is hard to distinguish
whether the measure is an impact of SLR (and ocean change more
broadly), for example, displacement, or an adaptation solution. In
addition, relocation of people displaces pressure to destination areas,
with a potential increase of risk for the latter. In other words, the
broader ‘coastal retreat’ category (Section 4.4.2.6) raises the issue
of the ‘limits to adaptation’, which is not represented in Figure 4.3.

"Accommodation includes diverse biophysical and institutional responses that mitigate coastal risk and impacts by reducing the
vulnerability of coastal residents, human activities, ecosystems and the built environment, thus enabling the habitability of coastal
Zones despite increasing levels of hazard occurrence. Accommodation measures for erosion and flooding include building codes, raising
house elevation (e.g., on stilts), lifting valuables to higher floors and floating houses and gardens (Trang, 2016). Accommodation
measures for salinity intrusion include changes in land use (e.g., rice to brackish/salt shrimp aquaculture) or changes to salt tolerant

crop varieties. Institutional accommodation responses include EWS, emergency planning, insurance schemes and setback zones (Nurse
et al., 2014; Wong et al., 2014).

"These conclusions must be nuanced, first, by the fact that our
assessment does not consider either financial or social aspects that
can act as limiting factors to the development of adaptation options
(Sections 4.4.3 and 4.4.5), for instance, hard engineering coastal
defences (Hurlimann et al., 2014; Jones et al., 2014; Elrick-Barr et al.,
2017; Hinkel et al., 2018). However, from a general perspective,
these findings suggest that although ambitious adaptation will
not necessarily eradicate end-century risk from SLR across all
low-lying coastal areas around the world, it will help to buy time
in many locations and therefore contribute to developing a robust
foundation for adaptation beyond 2100. Second, the future of other
climate-related drivers of risk (such as ESL, waves and cyclones;
Sections 4.2.3.4.1 to 4.2.3.4.3, 6.3.1.1 to 6.3.1.3) is not fully and
systematically included in each risk assessment above, so that much
larger risks than assessed here are to be expected.

"SLR responses refer to legislation, plans and actions undertaken to
reduce risk and build resilience in the face of SLR (see Cross-Chapter
Box 3 in Chapter 1). These responses range from protecting the coast,
accommodating SLR impacts, retreating from the coast, advancing
into the ocean by building seawards and EbA (Box 4.3). Identifying
the most appropriate way to respond to SLR is not straightforward
and is politically and socially contested with a range of governance
challenges (also called barriers) arising. This section first assesses
the post-AR5 literature on the different types of SLR responses
(ie., protection, accommodation, advance, retreat and EbA) in terms
of their effectiveness, technical limits, costs, benefits, co-benefits,
drawbacks, economic efficiency and barriers, and the specific
governance challenges associated with each type of response
(Section 4.4.2). It then identifies a set of overarching governance
challenges that arise from the nature of SLR, such as its long-term
commitment and uncertainty, and the associated politically and
socially contested choices that need to be made (Section 4.4.3). Next,
planning, public participation, conflict resolution and decision analysis
approaches and tools are assessed that, when applied in combination,
can help to address the governance challenges identified, facilitating
social choices about SLR responses (Section 4.4.4). Finally, enablers
and lessons learned from practical efforts to implement SLR responses
are assessed (Section 4.4.5), concluding with a synthesis emphasising
the utility of climate resilient development pathways (Section 4.4.6).

another important type of response is the management of subsidence
by, for instance, restricting ground fluid abstraction. Although this

governments from national to local levels and usually involves small sites and/or communities (Wong et al., 2014; Hino et al., 2017;
Mortreux et al., 2018). Managed realignment may also be conducted for the purpose of creating new habitat. These three sub-categories
are not neatly separable— any household's decision to retreat may be ‘voluntary’ in theory, but in practice, may result from very limited
choices. Displacement certainly occurs in response to extreme events but some of those retreating may have other options. Relocation
programs may rely on incentives such as land buyouts that households adopt voluntarily. The need for retreat and other response
measures can be reduced by avoiding new development commitments in areas prone to severe SLR hazards (Section 4.4.4.2).

"Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) responses provide a combination of protect and advance benefits based on the sustainable
management, conservation and restoration of ecosystems (Van Wesenbeeck et al., 2017). Examples include the conservation or
restoration of coastal ecosystems such as wetlands and reefs. EbA measures protect the coastline by (i) attenuating waves, and, in
the case of wetlands storm surge flows, by acting as obstacles and providing retention space (Krauss et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2012;
Vuik et al, 2015; Rupprecht et al., 2017); and (ii) by raising elevation and reducing rates of erosion through trapping and stabilising

drainage) in countries such as Belgium, Canada, China, Germany,
Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, Thailand, the UK, and the
USA (Nicholls, 2010). Many more people living above high tides are
also protected against ESL by hard structures in major cities around
the world. There is a concentration of these measures in northwest
Europe and East Asia, although extensive defences are also found in
and around many coastal cities and deltas. For example, large scale
coastal protection exists in Vancouver (Canada), Alexandria (Egypt)

a long history, offering multiple benefits in terms of enhancing

sandy beaches are currently eroding by rates faster than 0.5 m yr!
(Luijendijk et al, 2018). In the USA, Europe and Australia, these
responses are often driven by the recreational value of beaches and
the high economic benefits associated with beach tourism. More
recently, sediment-based measures are implemented as effective
and yet flexible measures to address SLR (Kabat et al., 2009) and
experiments are being conducted with innovative decadal scale
application of sediments such as the sand engine in the Netherlands

proactively in the planning process include SLR safety margins in, for
example, the UK, Germany and France, upgrading defences according

"There is high confidence that hard coastal protection will continue
to be a widespread response to SLR in densely populated and
urban areas during the 21st century, because this response is
widely practised (Section 4.4.2.2.2), effective in reducing current
(Section 4.4.2.2.2) and future flood risk (Section 4.3.3.2) and highly
cost efficient in urban and densely populated areas (Section 4.4.2.7).
There is, however, Jow agreement on the level of hard coastal
protections to expect, with projections being based on different
assumptions. A model assuming that coastal societies upgrade hard
protection following scenario-based cost-benefit analysis finds that
22% of the global coastline will be protected under various SSPs and
1 m of 21st century global mean SLR (Nicholls et al., 2019). Another
model assuming that only areas for which benefit-cost ratios are
above 1 under SLR scenarios up to 2 m, all SSPs and discount rates
up to 6%, finds that this would lead to protecting 13% of the global

maintenance costs are poorly described and hence more uncertain
(Nicholls et al., 2007). Protection-based adaptation to saltwater
intrusion is more complex than adaptation to flooding and erosion,
and there is less experience to draw upon.

"Sediment-based measures are generally costed as the unit cost of
sand (or gravel) delivery multiplied by the volumetric demand. Unit
costs range from 3-21 USD m3 sand, with some high outlier costs
in, for example, the UK, South Africa and New Zealand (Linham
et al., 2010; Aerts, 2018). Costs are small where sources of sand are
plentiful and close to the sites of demand. Costs are further reduced
by shoreface nourishment approaches. The Netherlands maintains its
entire open coast with large-scale shore nourishment (Mulder et al.,
2011) and the innovative sand engine has been implemented as a
full-scale decadal experiment (Stive et al., 2013). The capital costs
for dunes are similar to beach nourishment, although placement and
planting vegetation may raise costs. Maintenance costs vary from
almost nothing to several million USD km~', although costs are
usually at the lower end of this range (Environment Agency, 2015).

"It is difficult to assess at what point in time and for which amount
of SLR technical limits for coastal protection will be reached. Parts of
Tokyo have been protected against five metres of relative SLR during
the 21st century (Kaneko and Toyota, 2011) and it has been argued
that it is possible to preserve territorial integrity of the Netherlands
even under 5 m SLR, using current engineering technology (Aerts
et al., 2008; Olsthoorn et al., 2008). This suggests that under RCP2.6,
technical limits to adaptation will be rare even under longer-term
SLR. Protecting against high-end SLR will be increasingly technically
challenging as we move beyond the 21st century. This is not only due
to the absolute amount of SLR, but also due to the very high rates of
annual SLR (e.g., 10-20 mm yr /ikely range under RCP8.5 in 2100),
which challenge the planning and implementation of hard protection
because major protection infrastructure requires decades to plan and
implement (Gilbert et al., 1984; Burcharth et al., 2014). In summary,
the higher and faster SLR, the more challenging coastal protection
will be, but quantifying this is difficult. In any case, before technical
limits are reached, economic and social limits will be reached because
societies are neither economically able nor socially willing to invest in
coastal protection (Sections 4.4.2.2 and 4.3.3.2; Hinkel et al., 2018;
Esteban et al., 2019).

"There is high confidence that well designed and maintained hard and
sediment-based protection is very effective in reducing risk to the
impacts of SLR and ESL (Horikawa, 1978; USACE, 2002; CIRIA, 2007).
This includes situations in which coastal megacities in river deltas have
experienced, and adapted to, relative SLR of several metres caused by
land subsidence during the 20th century (Kaneko and Toyota, 2011;
Esteban et al., 2019; Box 4.1). In principle, there are no technological
limits to protect the coast during the 21st century even under high-end
SLR of 2 m (Section 4.3.3.2), but technological challenges can make
protection very expensive and hence unaffordable in some areas
(Hinkel et al., 2018). Examples include southeast Florida, because
protected areas can be flooded by rising groundwater through
underlying porous limestone (Bloetscher et al., 2011). Gradually rising
water tables behind defences is also an issue, which can be managed
by increasing pumping and drainage (Aerts, 2018). Maintaining this
effectiveness over time requires regular monitoring and maintenance,
accounting for changing conditions such as SLR and widespread
erosional trends in front of the defences. There will always be residual
risks, which can be reduced, but never eliminated, by engineering
protection infrastructure to very high standards, such as so-called
‘unbreakable dikes’ (de Bruijn et al., 2013).

interests. This includes conflicts between those favouring protection
and those being negatively affected by adaptation measures.

combine flood protection with other urban functions, such as car
parks, buildings, roads or recreational spaces into one multifunctional
structure (Stalenberg, 2013; van Loon-Steensma and Vellinga, 2014).
An important co-benefit of sediment-based protection, such as beach
nourishment and dune management, is that it preserves beach and
associated environments, as well as tourism (Everard et al., 2010;
Hinkel et al., 2013a; Stive et al., 2013).

"Seabed dredging of sand and gravel can have negative impacts on
marine ecosystems such as seagrass meadows and corals (Erftemeijer
and Lewis III, 2006; Erftemeijer et al., 2012). Nourishment practices
on sandy beaches have also been shown to have drawbacks for local
ecosystems if local habitat factors are not taken into consideration
when planning and implementing nourishment and maintenance
(Speybroeck et al., 2006). A further emerging issue is beach material
scarcity mainly driven by demand of sand and gravel for construction,
but also for beach and shore nourishment (Peduzzi, 2014; Torres
et al., 2017), which makes sourcing the increasing volumes of
beach materials required to sustain beaches in the face of SLR more
expensive and challenging (Roelvink, 2015).

"An associated governance challenge is ensuring the effective
maintenance of coastal protection. Ineffective maintenance has
contributed to many coastal disasters in the past, such as in
New Orleans (Andersen, 2007). ARS highlighted that effective
maintenance is challenging in a small island context due to a lack
of adequate funds, policies and technical skills (Nurse et al., 2014).
In some countries in which coastal defence systems have a long
history, effective governance arrangements for maintenance, such as
the Water Boards in the Netherlands, have emerged. In Bangladesh,
where Dutch-like polders were introduced in the 1960s, maintenance
has been a challenge due to shifts in multi-level governance
structures associated with independence, national policy priorities
and donor involvement (Dewan et al., 2015).
"	Text
"There is also conflict related to the distribution of public money
between communities receiving public support for adaptation and
non-coastal communities who pay for this support through taxes
(Elrick-Barr et al, 2015). Generally, access to financial resources
for adaptation, including from public sources, development and
climate finance or capital markets, frequently constrain adaptation
(Ekstrom and Moser, 2014; Hinkel et al, 2018). For example,
homeowners are often not willing to pay taxes or levies for public
protection or sediment-base measures even if they directly benefit,
as found, for example in communities on the US east coast where
beach nourishment is used to maintain recreational and tourism
amenities (Mullin et al, 2019). In many parts of the world, coastal
adaptation governance is further complicated by existing conflicts
over resources. For example, illegal coastal sand mining is currently a
major driver of coastal erosion in many parts of the developing world
(Peduzzi, 2014). Examples of this can be found in Ghana (Addo, 2015)
and the Comoros (Betzold and Mohamed, 2017).

"Drawbacks of hard protection include the alteration of hydrodynamic
and morphodynamic patterns, which in turn may export flooding and
erosion problems downdrift (Masselink and Gehrels, 2015; Nicholls
et al., 2015). For example, protection of existing shoreline in estuaries
and tidal creeks may increase tidal amplification in the upper parts
(Lee et al, 2017). Hard protection also hinders or prohibits the
onshore migration of geomorphic features and ecosystems (called
coastal squeeze; Pontee, 2013; Gittman et al., 2016), leading to both
a loss of habitat as well as of the protection function of ecosystems
(see Sections 4.3.2.4 and 4.4.2.2). Another drawback of raising
hard structures, also emphasised in ARS, is the risk of lock-in to a
development pathway in which development intensifies behind
higher and higher defences, with escalating severe consequences in
the event of protection failure (Wong et al., 2014; Welch et al., 2017),
as experienced in Hurricane Katrina impacted New Orleans (Burby,
2006; Freudenburg et al., 2009). This lock-in results from protection
attracting further economic development in the flood zone within
defenses, which then leads to further raising defences with SLR, and
the growing value of exposed assets.

"At global scales, new economic assessments of responses have
mostly focused on the direct costs of hard protection and the
benefits of reducing coastal extreme event flood risks. These studies
confirm AR5 findings that the benefits of reducing coastal flood
risk through hard protection exceed the costs of protection, on a
global average, and for cities and densely populated areas, during
the 21st century even under high-end SLR (medium evidence, high
agreement; Hallegatte et al., 2013; Wong et al., 2014; Diaz, 2016;
Lincke and Hinkel, 2018). For example, Lincke and Hinkel (2018) find
that, during the 21st century, it is economically efficient to protect
13% of the global coastline, which corresponds to 90% of global
floodplain population, under SLR scenarios from 0.3-2.0 m, five
SSPs and discount rates up to 6% (Figure 4.14). While the above
two studies have not considered the effects of hard protection in
reducing the area of coastal wetlands, it is expected that coastal hard
protection in densely populated areas and conserving wetlands in
sparsely populated areas can go hand in hand. Protecting less than
42% of the global coastline would leave coastal wetlands sufficient
accommodation space to even grow in areas under rising sea levels

studies, hard protection is generally found to be economically efficient
for urban and densely populated areas such as New York, USA (Aerts
et al. 2014) and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam (Scussolini et al., 2017).
Both global and local studies show that sediment-based protection,
such as beach nourishment is economically efficient in areas of
intensive tourism development due to the large revenues generated
within this sector (Rigall-I-Torrent et al., 2011; Hinkel et al., 2013a).

conserving existing coastal ecosystems, and where possible restoring
them, for the flood protection and multiple other benefits they

EbA measures are increasingly being incorporated and required
within national plans, strategies and targets (Lo, 2016), international
adaptation funding mechanisms, such as the Adaptation Fund (AF;
e.g., in Sri Lanka and India; Epple et al., 2016), and national natural

"et al., 2017). EbA, by definition, can only exist and function where
the environmental conditions are appropriate for a given ecosystem.
Mangroves, salt marshes and reefs occur along about 40-50% of the
world’s coastlines (Wessel and Smith, 1996; Burke, 2011; Giri et al.,
2011; Mcowen et al., 2017). However, there is no clear estimate on
the global length of coastline covered by ecosystems relevant for
EbA in the face of SLR in part because of a mismatch between the
spatial resolutions of different estimates available. Mangroves occur
on tropical and subtropical coasts, and cover 138,000-152,000 km?
across about 120 countries (Spalding et al., 2010; Giri et al., 2011).
At least 150,000 km of coastline in over 100 countries benefit from
the presence of coral reefs (Burke, 2011) and these are estimated to
protect over 100 million people from wave-induced flooding globally
(Ferrario et al., 2014). The extent of other coastal habitats is less well
known: salt marshes are estimated to occur in 99 countries, especially
in temperature to high latitude locations, with nearly 5,500,000 ha
mapped across 43 countries (Mcowen et al., 2017).

free of maintenance costs, because they respond and adapt to

become important in the aftermath of damage by storms or human
action, for example, when wetlands and reefs can be damaged by
high winds, waves and surges, or affected by dredging operations
(Smith III et al., 2009; Puotinen et al., 2016). At present, there is
limited evidence about the conditions under which EbA measures
can self-adapt and when they require human intervention to recover.

"There is limited evidence and low agreement on the costs of
ecosystem-based measures to make generally valid estimations
of the unit costs across large spatial scales. The total cost of an
ecosystem-based measure includes capital costs, maintenance costs,
the cost of land and, in some situations, permitting costs (Bilkovic,
2017). The costs of restoring and maintaining coastal habitats depend
on coastal setting, habitat type and project conditions. In general, unit
restoration costs are lowest for mangroves, higher for salt marshes and
oyster reefs, and highest for seagrass beds and coral reefs (Table 4.8).

"While there are projections available of ecosystem responses
to climate change and SLR (Section 4.3.3), to date, there are no
large-scale projections available on the future extent of EbA. However,
several coastal nations, particularly Small Island Developing States
(SIDS) explicitly advocate EbA measures as a means to address future
coastal hazard and SLR concerns. Based on Nationally Determined
Contributions (NDCs) submitted to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), more than 30 SIDS cite
EbA as a preferred SLR response, with mangrove planting being the
most common measure (Wong, 2018).

"The conservation of coral reefs and other coastal habitats may
also entail substantial opportunity costs because alternative uses
of this land, such as through agricultural production, industry and
settlements, are generally of high economic value (Stewart et al.,
2003; Balmford et al., 2004; Adams et al., 2011; Hunt, 2013). The high
value of these alternative uses are the reason why globally, coastal
ecosystems are amongst the ecosystems that face the highest rates
of anthropogenic destruction, with estimated annual losses of 1-3%
of mangroves area, 2—5% seagrass area and 49% corals (Duarte
et al., 2013). Conserving these areas means reversing these trends.
"	Text
"EbA has been used as an integral part of some retreat, advance
and accommodation responses. For example, on coastlines where
high-risk properties are relocated inland, space can be made for
ecosystem restoration to enhance natural biodiversity and provide
coastal protection (French, 2006; Coastal Protection and Restoration
Authority of Louisiana, 2017). There are also examples of ecosystem
restoration to advance coastlines and build land elevation (Chung,
2006). EbA can also be an element of accommodation responses by,
for example, restoring or creating marshes to provide space for flood
water (Temmerman et al., 2013).
"	Text
"While EbA has been able to reduce the impacts of sea level related
hazards, there is still little agreement on the size of the effect
(Gedan et al., 2011; Doswald et al., 2012; Lo, 2016; Renaud et al.,
2016). Dozens of independent field, experimental and numerical
studies have observed and measured the wave attenuation and
flood reduction benefits provided by natural habitats, such as marsh
and mangrove wetlands (Barbier and Enchelmeyer, 2014; Méller
et al. 2014; Rupprecht et al., 2017), coral reefs (Ferrario et al.,
2014; Storlazzi et al., 2017), oyster reefs (Scyphers et al, 2011) and
submerged seagrass beds (Infantes et al., 2012). Local and global
numerical studies indicate that marshes and mangroves can reduce
present-day surge-related flood damages by >15% annually, and the
loss of a metre of living coral reef can double annual wave-related
flood damages (Narayan et al., 2017; Beck et al., 2018). Artificial reef
restoration along tens of metres of coastline using Reef Ball™ and
other structures has been shown to reduce wave heights and stabilise
beach widths (Reguero et al., 2018a; Torres-Freyermuth et al., 2018).

Management Agency (FEMA) of the USA, allows proponents of hazard
mitigation projects, such as state, territorial and local governments, to
take into account the co-benefits of EbA when assessing benefit-cost

"The effectiveness of ecosystem-based measures also exhibits high
seasonal, annual and longer-term variability. For example, marsh
and seagrass wetlands typically have lower densities in winter which
reduces their coastal protection capacity (Méller and Spencer, 2002;
Paul and Amos, 2011; Schoutens et al., 2019). In the long-term, there
is limited evidence and low agreement on how changes in sea level,
sediment inputs, ocean temperature and ocean acidity will influence
the extent, distribution and health of marsh and mangrove wetlands,
coral reefs and oyster reefs (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007; Lovelock et al.,
2015; Crosby et al., 2016; Albert et al., 2017). EoA measures may have
differential lead times before they are effective. For example, newly
planted mangroves provide less wave attenuation until they mature
(~3-5 years; Mazda et al., 1997). In contrast, a reef restoration project
that uses submerged concrete structures performs as a breakwater as

raising coastal flats above normal tidal levels through sediment

coastal ecosystems have been lost due to land reclamation, leading
to a range of impacts such as loss of biodiversity, decline of bird

frequent harmful algal blooms (Wang et al., 2014). For example, the
reclamation of about 29,000 ha of land in Saemangeum, Republic of

30% in two years, probably caused by mortality (Moores et al., 2016).

trends suggest further uptake of accommodation approaches in

accommodation measures for salinity are under further development,

salinity tolerance in rice are rather modest so far (Hoang et al., 2016)

that index based insurance products have been included in NDCs and
NAPs in a number of countries (Kreft et al., 2017), uptake is expected

"Climate risk insurance schemes have been recently developed to
address sudden, and in rare cases, slow onset hazards at the coast,
and to increase overall resilience. For coastal risks, insurance is
mainly applicable for sudden onset hazards, including storm surges
and coastal flooding, to buffer against the financial impacts of
loss events. For slow onset hazards, insurance schemes are not the
first-best tool, whereas resilience building and prevention of loss
and damage in such instances may be more cost-effective ways
to address these risks (Warner et al., 2013). In this context, index
based insurance products are increasingly offered, particularly in
low-income countries and have also been included in a number
of countries in their NDCs and in some cases in their National
Adaptation Plans (NAPs; Kreft et al., 2017). Countries with existing
climate risk insurance schemes include, for example, Haiti, Maldives,
Seychelles and Vietnam. The InsuResilience Global Partnership for
Climate and Disaster Risk Finance and Insurance Solutions was
launched at the 2017 UN Climate Conference (COP 23) in Bonn.
InsuResilience aims to enable more timely response after a disaster
and helps to better prepare for climate and disaster risk through
the use of climate and disaster risk finance and insurance solutions.
So far, climate risk insurance was used mainly in the context of
agriculture, where it has showed great efficacy in boosting
investments for increasing productivity (Fernandez and Schafer,
2018). However, on the global scale, the uptake of index insurance
is still low (Yuzva et al., 2018).

"While accommodation measures to coastal hazards are often taking
place at the local level, and are decided by individual homeowners,
farmers or communities, from a governance perspective it is important
to provide guidance on how and to what extent owners can retrofit
their homes to reduce the risk to coastal flooding. In New York City,
for instance, changes to building codes, require elevating, or flood
proofing of existing and new buildings in the 100-year floodplain,
and prevent construction of critical infrastructure like hospitals in the
flood zone (NYC, 2014; see also Box 4.1).

"Co-benefits of insurance include the possibility that sovereign level
insurance may improve the credit ratings of vulnerable countries,
reducing the cost of capital and allowing them to borrow to invest in
resilient infrastructure (Buhr et al., 2018). Major natural disasters can
weaken sovereign ratings, especially if there is no insurance in place
(Moritz Kramer, 2015). One much discussed drawback of insurance is
the moral hazard that may result: since someone else bears the costs
of a loss, those insured may be less inclined to take precautionary
measures or may act recklessly (Duus-Otterstrém and Jagers, 2011).

"The major drawback of accommodation is that it actually does not
prevent flooding or salinisation, which might have consequences not
addressed by the accommodation measure itself. Examples include
inundation of an area where houses are flood proofed but schooling
of children and business operations are nevertheless disrupted.
Significant clean up may also be needed after flood water enters
buildings, including the removal of sediment, debris or chemical
residues (FEMA, 2014). Also, flood proofing measures require the
current risk of flooding to be known and communicated to and
understood by the public through flood hazard mapping studies and
flood warning information (Zhu et al., 2010). Small businesses in
particular may face difficulties to recover from flooding due to lack of
forward planning (Hoggart et al., 2014).

"The cost of accommodation varies widely with the measures taken as
well as the expected flood height. For flood proofing of buildings in
New York City for instance, Aerts et al. (2014) provided an economic
rationale for the implementation of improved building codes, such as
elevating new buildings and protecting critical infrastructure (see also
Box 4.1). Flood proofing can also be undertaken by individuals and
even small, inexpensive flood proofing efforts can result in reductions
in flood damage (Zhu et al., 2010). In general, costs for flood proofing
increase as the flood protection elevation increases. Other costs
include those for maintenance and, if applicable, insurance premiums.
For example, deciding to elevate a building in the USA will increase
the project's cost; however, the additional elevation may lead to
significant savings on flood insurance premiums (FEMA, 2014).
"	Text
"The major co-benefit of accommodation is improved resilience of in
situ communities without retreat or the use of land and resources for
the construction of protection measures. Flood proofing, for example,
helps prevent demolition or relocation of structures and it is often
an affordable and cost effective approach to reducing flood risk
(Zhu et al., 2010). Specific accommodation measures have different
co-benefits such as that stilt houses not only protect from flooding
but also from wild animals (Biswas et al., 2015). Accommodation —
depending on the measure implemented — has the potential to
maintain landscape connectivity allowing access to the ocean as well
as landward migration of ecosystems, at least to some degree. It also
retains flood dynamics and with that the benefits of flooding such as
sediment re-distribution. Stilt houses leave space for the floodwater
while wet-flood proofing maintains a low hydrostatic pressure on the
buildings so that structures are less prone to failure during flooding
(FEMA, 2014).

"Accommodation measures can be very effective for current
conditions and small amounts of SLR, also buying time to prepare
for future SLR. Success stories include the case of Bangladesh
where improved early warnings, the construction of shelters, and
development of evacuation plans, helped to reduce fatalities as a
result of flooding and cyclones (Haque et al., 2012). Illiteracy, lack
of awareness and poor communication are, however, still hampering
the effectiveness of early warnings (Haque et al. 2012). If well
designed, and if the premiums reflect individual risks, insurance can
effectively discourage further investments in risky areas as insurance
cost provides information on the nature of locality-specific risks and
can incentivise investment in risk reduction by requiring that certain
minimum standards are met before granting insurance coverage
(Kunreuther, 2015). Limits to such accommodation occur much earlier
compared to protect, advance and retreat measures. While dikes
can be raised to 10 m, and retreat can be implemented to the 10 m
contour or higher, accommodating SLR has practical and economic
limits, and ultimately retreat or protection will be required.

emphasises that the relationship between climate change impacts
including SLR and migration is more nuanced than suggested by
simplified cause-and-effect models (Adger et al., 2015). Migration
is driven by a large number of individual, social, economic, political,
demographic and environmental push and pull factors (Black et al.,
2011; Koubi et al., 2016), interwoven with mega-trends such as
urbanisation, land use change and globalisation, and is influenced by

and households are more able to migrate out from flood-prone
areas (Milan and Ruano, 2014; Logan et al., 2016), while the poorest
households are significantly susceptible to material and human losses
following an extreme event or disruptive environmental change

of environmental change (Koubi et al., 2016), formed by both direct
experience of change and indirect information from social networks,

include the longer term impacts of climate variability and change,
which can erode the capacity of ecosystems to provide essential
services such as availability of freshwater, soil fertility and energy
production acting as a threat multiplier for other drivers of migration

including the cost for land acquisition, infrastructure and construction
of new dwellings (State of Louisiana, 2015). Generally, maintenance
costs do not arise if people are moved completely out of the hazard
zone (Suppasri et al., 2015; Hino et al., 2017). In cases in which people
are only moved so that short-term but not long-term risk is reduced,
follow up costs for further responses will occur.

"A global dynamic general equilibrium framework (Desmet et al., 2018)
provides a more comprehensive approach to accounting for economic
factors including changes to trade, innovation, and agglomeration,
and political factors, such as policy barriers to mobility, all of
which influence the migration response to environmental change.
Agent-based models attempt to simulate decisions by individuals who
face a variety of socioeconomic and environmental changes (Kniveton
et al., 2012). However, neither general equilibrium nor agent-based
frameworks have been applied yet to migration responses to SLR.
Econometric models, common in climate/migration studies (Millock,
2015), likewise have yet to be applied to the SLR context, except for a
single case study where an econometric model was used to interpret
the outcome of a discrete choice experiment (Buchanan et al., 2019).
For example, an interesting distinction between migration responses
to long term temperature and precipitation trends in contrast to
extreme events like flooding has been noted (Bohra-Mishra et al.,
2014; Mueller et al., 2014), but similar econometric studies have yet
to be done comparing responses to gradual land loss versus flooding
during ESL events.

"Governance is pivotal to shaping SLR responses. The assessment of
SLR responses above has shown that each type of response raises
specific governance challenges associated with the distribution
of costs, benefits and negative consequences of responses across
societal actors. Hence, SLR responses require governance efforts if
social conflicts are to be resolved and mutual opportunities amongst
all actors realised. Generally, responses involve the interaction of
diverse public and private actors at different levels of decision making
with divergent values, interests and goals on coastal activities,
lifestyles, livelihoods, risks, resilience and sustainability (high
confidence; Dovers and Hezri, 2010; Foerster et al., 2015; Giddens,
2015; Mills et al., 2016; DolSak and Prakash, 2018; Hinkel et al.,

overarching governance challenges that arise from the nature of SLR,
which will be assessed in this section.

"While there is a substantial literature on coastal governance, little
attention has been focused explicitly on SLR governance, as was
also the case in AR5 (Wong et al., 2014). Furthermore, much of the
adaptation governance literature has focused on putting forward
normative prescriptions on how governance arrangements ought
to be (eg., transformative governance; Chaffin et al, 2016), but
with limited empirical evidence on the actual effectiveness of these
prescriptions (Klostermann et al., 2018; Runhaar et al., 2018). Hence,
understanding the social mechanisms leading to the emergence
of particular governance arrangements, and how effective they
are in addressing climate change and SLR, is limited (Wong et al.,
2014; Bisaro and Hinkel, 2016; Oberlack, 2017; Bisaro et al., 2018;
Roggero et al., 2018a; Roggero et al., 2018b). An important post-AR5
development has thus been to move beyond descriptions and
normative prescriptions about ‘good governance’ to explore which
factors help (called enablers) or hinder (called barriers) how social
choices are made and implemented on complex issues like climate
change and SLR, as elaborated in the next subsection.

the principle of procedural justice and respecting the autonomy of
individuals and their decisions about where and how they live (Warner
et al., 2013; Schade et al., 2015; McNamara et al., 2018). However,
there are cases where logistical and political stances constrain the
application of such approach, such as when the government of Sri
Lanka prohibited rebuilding along the coastline of the country after
the 2004 tsunami (Hino et al., 2017). Proactive planning, including
participation and consultation with those in peril, has the potential
to improve outcomes (medium confidence; de Sherbinin et al., 2011;
Gemenne and Blocher, 2017). Governments can assist migrants
through policy reforms to enable relocation to fast growing economic
regions in the country. An example of this approach was adopted in
Vietnam by both the National Target Program to Respond to Climate
Change and the National Strategy for Natural Disaster Prevention,
Response and Mitigation targeted at locations within the Mekong
Delta exposed to the impacts of SLR (Nguyen et al., 2015; Collins
et al., 2017). Outcomes of retreat for both community of origin and
destination can also be improved by building the human capital of
migrants (skills, health and education), reducing costs of migration
and remittance transfer, and provision of improved safety nets for
migrants at their destinations (high agreement) (Gemenne and
Blocher, 2017).

"Environmentally driven migration and displacement gained major
attention over the last decade in the international policy community
(Goodwin-Gill and McAdam, 2017). Worldwide programmes, such
as the Nansen Initiative, signed by 110 countries to address the
serious legal gap around the protection of cross-border migrants
impacted by natural disasters, have been implemented (Gemenne

was established to follow up on the work conducted by the Nansen
Initiative with the objective of implementing the recommendations
of the Protection Agenda (McAdam and Ferris, 2015). Governments
are further encouraged by civil society to relocate people at risk and
displaced populations out of disaster-prone areas to avoid potential
casualties (Lei et al., 2017; Mortreux et al., 2018). There have been
discussions among Pacific Island countries and territories and other
nations in the Pacific Rim around new policy mechanisms that would
facilitate adaptive migration in the region in response to natural
hazards including SLR (Burson and Bedford, 2015). There have been
cases presented at the Immigration and Protection Tribunal of New
Zealand testing refugee claims associated with climate change from
Tuvaluan and i-Kiribati applicants, both citing environmental change
on their home islands as grounds for remaining in New Zealand.
One applicant was successful in the quest to remain in New Zealand

coordination problems across jurisdictional levels and domains,

administrative priority amongst many, and the choice of SLR response
is influenced by multiple co-existing functional responsibilities

communities and society in ways that are not evenly distributed,
which can compound vulnerability and inequity, and undermine
societal aspirations, such as achieving SDGs (high confidence;

unevenly, with some coastal nations, particularly small island states,
being confronted with adaptation costs amounting to several percent
of GDP in the 21st century (Section 4.3.3.2). Land use planning for
climate adaptation can exacerbate sociospatial inequalities at the
local level, as illustrated in a study of eight cities, namely Boston
(USA), New Orleans (USA), Medellin (Colombia), Santiago (Chile),
Metro Manila (Philippines), Jakarta (Indonesia), Surat (India), and
Dhaka (Bangladesh; Anguelovski et al., 2016). Private responses may
also exacerbate inequalities as, for example, in Miami, USA, where
purchase of homes in areas at higher elevation has increased property
prices displacing poorer communities from these areas (Keenan et al.,
2018). In Bangladesh, some adaptation practices have enabled land
capture by elites, public servants, the military and roving gangs,
and resulted in various forms of marginalisation that compound
vulnerability and risk (Sovacool, 2018); a reality also faced by many
other coastal communities around the world (Sovacool et al., 2015).

to develop and pursue a shared vision, and understand and address
SLR concerns in locality-specific ways (Hurlimann and March, 2012;
Berke and Stevens, 2016). Planning can help articulate and clarify
roles and responsibilities through statutory planning provisions,
complemented by non-statutory processes (Vella et al., 2016). It can
build social and administrative networks that mobilise cross-scale
SLR responses, and facilitate integration of diverse mitigation and
adaptation goals alongside other public aspirations and policy
imperatives (Hurlimann and March, 2012; Vella et al., 2016). Planning
can also facilitate the establishment of collaborative regional forums
that cross jurisdictional boundaries and assist local governments
and other stakeholders to pool resources and coordinate roles
and responsibilities across multiple governance levels, such as the
Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact, USA (Shi
et al., 2015; Vella et al., 2016). Regulatory planning can be used by
governing authorities to steer future infrastructure, housing, industry
and related development away from areas exposed to SLR (Hurlimann

"Social conflict: Ongoing SLR could become a catalyst for possibly
intractable social conflict by impacting human activities, infrastructure
and development along low-lying shorelines (high confidence). Social
conflict refers here to the non-violent struggle between groups,
organisations and communities over values, interests, resources,
and influence or power, whereby parties seek to achieve their own
goals, and may seek to prevent others from realising their goals and
possibly harm rivals (Coser, 1967; Oberschall, 1978; Pruitt et al., 2003).
SLR impacts that could contribute to conflict include: disruptions to
critical infrastructure, cultural ties to the coast, livelihoods, coastal
economies, public health, well-being, security, identity and the
sovereignty of some low-lying island nations (Sections 4.3.2.4,
4.3.3.2, 4.3.3.6; Mills et al., 2016; Yusuf et al, 2016; Nursey-Bray,
2017; Hinkel et al, 2018). SLR responses inevitably raise difficult
trade-offs between private and public interests, short- and long-term
concerns, and security and conservation goals, which are difficult to
reconcile due to divergent problem framing, interests, values and
ethical positions (Eriksen et al., 2015; Foerster et al., 2015; Mills et al.,
2016; Termeer et al., 2017; Sovacool, 2018). To some countries, SLR
presents a security risk due to the scale of potential displacement
and migration of people (Section 4.4.2.6). Climate change, and rising
seas in particular, could compound sociopolitical stressors (Sovacool
et al., 2015), challenge the efficacy of prevailing legal processes
(Byrne, 2012; Busch, 2018; Setzer and Vanhala, 2019), and spark or
escalate conflict (Lusthaus, 2010; Nursey-Bray, 2017).

Planning practice is thus both a contributor to and an outcome of
local politics and power. Recognising and navigating these challenges
is key to realising the promise of planning for reducing SLR risk, and
participatory planning processes that reconcile divergent interests

Engagement strategies grounded in community deliberation can

"Conflict resolution refers to formal and informal processes that enable
parties to create peaceful solutions for their disputes (Bercovitch et al.,
2008). They range from litigation and adjudication to more collaborative
processes based on facilitation, mediation and negotiation (Susskind
et al., 1999; Bercovitch et al., 2008). Such processes can be used in
the public domain to make difficult social choices. Whilst it may be
impossible to eliminate controversy and disputes due to SLR, conflict
resolution can be foundational for achieving effective, fair and just
outcomes for coastal communities (Susskind et al., 2015; Nursey-Bray,
2017). Whereas some responses to social conflict (see definition
in Section 4.4.3.3) can be destructive (e.g., resorting to violence),
constructive approaches to conflict resolution (e.g., negotiation and
mediation) can help disputants satisfy their interests and even have
transformational adaptation potential (Laws et al., 2014; Nursey-Bray,
2017). Laws et al. (2014), for example, use the term ‘hot adaptation’ to
describe adaptation efforts that harness the energy and engagement
that conflict provokes; and create opportunities for public deliberation
and social learning about complex problems like SLR. Such an approach
has particular relevance in settings most at risk to SLR. Realising this
potential is, however, challenging in the face of local politics and the
differential power and influence of disputants. These realities have
been accounted for in public conflict resolution scholarship and
practice for many decades (Forester, 1987; Dukes, 1993; Forester, 2006),
and lessons learned are beginning to be applied to adaptation (Laws
et al., 2014; Nursey-Bray, 2017; Sultana and Thompson, 2017) and SLR
response planning (Susskind et al., 2015). Conflict was turned into
cooperation in some villages in floodplains in Bangladesh, for example,
by facilitated dialogue and incentivised cooperation between local
communities and government, with external facilitator assistance,
leading to improved water security in a climate stressed environment
(Sultana and Thompson, 2017). At a larger scale, the Mekong River
Commission, with its water diplomacy framework, provides an
institutional structure and processes, with technical support, and legal
and strategic mechanisms, that help to negotiate solutions for complex
delta problems and, in so doing, help avert widespread destruction of
livelihoods and conflict (Kittikhoun and Staubli, 2018).

"A growing literature on decision analysis of coastal adaptation
advocates the use of RDM approaches instead of maximising
expected utility approaches (Hallegatte et al., 2012; Haasnoot et al.,
2013; Lempert et al., 2013; Wong et al., 2017). The core criterion to
be considered for choosing between the two types of approaches
is whether one is confronted with a situation of shallow or deep
uncertainty (high confidence) (Lempert and Schlesinger, 2001; Kwakkel
et al., 2010; Kwakkel et al., 2016b; Hinkel et al., 2019). Uncertainty
is shallow when a single unambiguous objective or subjective
probability distribution can be attached to states-of-the-world.
Uncertainty is deep, when this is not possible, either because there
is no unambiguous method for deriving objective probabilities or
the subjective probability judgements of parties involved differ
(Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 1; Type 2).

"In order to be effective, decision analysis needs to be embedded in a
governance process that accounts for societal needs and objectives
(Sections 4.4.4.2 and 4.4.5). This is because decision analysis entails
a number of normative choices about the objectives chosen, the
criteria used, the specific methods and data applied, the set of
alternatives considered, and the attributes used to characterise
alternatives. These choices need to reflect the diversity of values,
preference and goals of all stakeholders involved in and affected
by a decision. Furthermore, decision analysis needs to consider
all available knowledge, including all major uncertainties in both
climate and non-climate factors, ambiguities in expert opinions,
and differences in approaches, because a partial consideration of
uncertainty and ambiguity could misguide the choice of adaptation
alternatives (high confidence; Renn, 2008; Jones et al., 2014; Hinkel
and Bisaro, 2016).
"	Text
"Expected utility approaches can only be applied for identifying an
optimal response in situations of shallow uncertainty. This is because
these approaches require a probability distribution over states of
the world in order to identify the optimal alternative which leads
to the highest expected utility (i.e., the probability weighted sum
of the utilities of all outcomes under a given alternative and all
states-of-the-world; Simpson et al., 2016). A prominent example
of this approach is cost-benefit analysis under risk, which assesses
expected outcomes across states of the world in terms of NPV (the
discounted stream of net benefits). Cost-benefit analysis has several
well-known limitations, such as its sensitivity to discount rates and
the difficulty to monetise ecological, cultural and other intangible
benefits (Section 1.1.4) that have been widely discussed in the
climate change literature (Chambwera et al., 2014; Kunreuther et al.,
2014; Dennig, 2018).
"	Text
"In the context of coastal adaptation, uncertainty is only shallow
if projected SLR does not significantly differ between low end
(e.g., RCP2.6) and high end (e.g., RCP8.5) scenarios (Hinkel et al.,
2019). The point in time when this is the case (i.e., time of scenario
divergence) depends on what difference in expected utility matters
to the particular stakeholders involved in a decision. The time of
scenario divergence also differs across locations. In locations where
the internal sea level variability is large as compared to relative SLR,
it takes longer before the differences in sea levels under low end and
high end scenarios become apparent. Figure 4.15 illustrates this effect
for the ESL projections of this report (Sections 4.2.3.2 and 4.2.3.4),
following the approach of Hinkel et al. (2019). Under the assumption
that a 10% statistical distance between the distributions of RCP2.6
and RCP8.5 is decision relevant, scenario divergence occurs before
2050 for approximately two thirds of coastal sites with sufficient
observational data, but for 7% of locations this occurs later than 2070.

"Decision analysis methods are formal methods that help to identify
alternatives that perform best or well with regard to given objectives.
An alternative (also called response option or, as a sequence of
options over time: adaptation pathway) is a specific combination of
SLR responses (See Section 4.4.3). Each alternative is characterised
for each possible future state-of-the world (e.g., levels of SLR or
socioeconomic development) by one or several attributes, which may
measure any relevant social, ecological, or economic effect associated
with choosing and implementing the alternative (Kleindorfer
et al, 1993). Attributes commonly used include cost of adaptation
alternatives, monetary and non-monetary benefits of the SLR impacts
avoided, or net present value (NPV), which is the difference between
discounted monetised benefits over time and discounted costs over
time. Formal decision analysis is one way to support social choices
that is generally suggested for decision support if decisions are
complex and involve large investments, as is frequently the case in
coastal contexts in the face of SLR.

"The uncertainty tolerance of stakeholders is also determining how
large of a SLR range needs to be considered in RDM. Stakeholders
(ie, those deciding and those affected by a decision) that have a
high uncertainty tolerance (e.g., those planning for investments that
can be very easily adapted) can use the combined /ikely range of
RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 (0.29-1.10 m by 2100) for long-term adaptation
decisions. For stakeholders with a low uncertainty tolerance (e.g.
those planning for coastal safety in cities and long term investment in
critical infrastructure) it is meaningful to also consider SLR above this
range, because a 17% chance of GMSL exceeding this range under
RCP8.5 is too high to be tolerated from this point of view (Ranger
et al., 2013; Hinkel et al., 2015; Hinkel et al., 2019).

"Under situations of deep uncertainty, RDM approaches aim to identify
alternatives that perform reasonably well (i.e., ‘are robust’) under a
wide range of states-of-the-world or scenarios and hence do not
require probability assessments. These approaches include minimax
or minimax regret (Savage, 1951), info gap theory (Ben-Haim, 2006),
robust optimisation (Ben-Tal et al., 2009) and exploratory modelling
methods that create a large ensemble of plausible future scenarios
for each alternative, and then use search and visualisation techniques
to extract robust alternatives (Lempert and Schlesinger, 2000). SLR
examples of RDM include Brekelmans (2012) who minimise the
average and maximum regret across a range of SLR scenarios for
investments in dike rings in the Netherlands and Lempert et al. (2013)
who apply RDM in Hoh-Chi-Minh City.

"In principle, a single unambiguous probability distribution on future
sea levels could also be attained beyond the time of scenario
divergence by attributing subjective probabilities to emission
scenarios, but individuals may significantly disagree in their subjective
probabilities, which again results in deep uncertainty (Lempert and
Schlesinger, 2001; Stirling, 2010). For this reason, very few studies
that assign subjective probabilities to emission scenarios are found in
the literature (Woodward et al., 2014; Abadie, 2018). But even before
the year of scenario divergence is reached, uncertainty about relative
SLR can be deep, because of deep uncertainties about non-climatic
contributors to relative sea level change, such as VLM during or after
earthquakes and human-induced subsidence (Cross-Chapter 5 in
Chapter 1; Section 4.2.2.4; Hinkel et al., 2019).

Scenario-based cost-benefit analysis differs from cost-benefit analysis
under risk discussed above in that scenario-based cost-benefit analysis
is not applied to rank alternatives across scenarios, but a ‘separate’
cost-benefit analysis is applied within each emission or SLR scenario
considered. While this identifies the optimal alternative under each
scenario, it does not formally address the problem faced by a coastal
decision maker, namely to decide across scenarios (Lincke and Hinkel,
2018). Nevertheless, the results of scenario-based cost-benefit analysis
(ie., NPV of each alternative under each scenario) provide guidance
for decision makers and can also be used as inputs (i.e., as attributes)
to robust and flexible decision making approaches.
"	Text
"Irrespective of whether expected utility or robustness criteria are
applied, there is high confidence that an effective way of dealing with
large uncertainties is adaptive decision making (also called iterative
decision making, adaptive planning or adaptive management), which
maintains that decision and decision analysis should be conducted
within an iterative policy cycle. This approach includes monitoring of
sea level variables and evaluation of alternatives in this light in order
to learn from past decisions and collect information to inform future
decisions (Haasnoot et al., 2013; Barnett et al., 2014; Burch et al.,
2014; Jones et al., 2014; Wise et al., 2014; Kelly, 2015; Lawrence and
Haasnoot, 2017). Such a staged approach is especially suitable for
coastal adaptation due to the long lead and lifetimes of many coastal
adaptation measures and the deep uncertainties in future sea levels
(Hallegatte, 2009; Kelly, 2015). Prominent representatives of methods
that entail this idea are Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (Haasnoot
et al, 2013) and Dynamic Adaptation Planning (Walker et al.,
2001). An important prerequisite for any adaptive decision-making
approach is a monitoring system that can detect sea level signals
sufficiently early to enable the required responses (Hermans et al.,
2017; Haasnoot et al., 2018; Stephens et al., 2018).

"An idea closely related to adaptive decision making is to keep future
alternatives open by favouring flexible alternatives over non-flexible
ones. An alternative is said to be ‘flexible’ if it allows switching to
other alternatives once the implemented alternative is no longer
effective. For example, a flexible protection approach would be to
build small dikes on foundations designed for higher dikes, in order
to be able to raise dikes in the future should SLR necessitate this.
"	Text
"Alternatives can also be characterised through multiple attributes
such as costs, effectiveness, co-benefits, social acceptability, etc.,
which in turn can be used in multi-attribute decision making methods
(Haasnoot et al., 2013). An important attribute is transfer cost, which
is the cost of course correction (switching from one alternative to
another), reflecting the potential for path dependency (Haasnoot
et al., 2019). Delaying decisions and opting for flexible measures
introduces extra costs, such as transfer costs. Also, flexible measures
are often more expensive than inflexible ones, and damages may
occur whilst delaying the decision. An important question therefore
is whether it is cheaper to implement a flexible measure now or to
wait and implement a less flexible (i.e, cheaper) measure later in
time when more information is at hand.
"	Text
"A prominent and straightforward method that addresses the objective
of flexibility is adaptation pathways analysis (Haasnoot et al., 2011;
Haasnoot et al., 2012), which is one component of Dynamic Adaptive
Policy Pathways. The method graphically represents alternative
combinations of measures over time together with information on
the conditions under which alternatives cease to be effective in
meeting agreed objectives, as well as possible alternatives that will
then be available. As time and SLR progress, monitoring may trigger
a decision to switch to another alternative. Adaptation pathway
analysis has been widely applied both in the scientific literature as
well as in practical cases. Applications after AR5 include Indonesia
(Butler et al., 2014), New York City (Rosenzweig and Solecki, 2014),
Singapore (Buurman and Babovic, 2016) and Australia (Lin and
Shullman, 2017). In New Zealand, the method has been included in
national guidance for coastal hazard and climate change decision
making (Lawrence et al., 2018). There is high confidence that the
method is useful in interaction with decision makers and other
stakeholders, helping to identify possible alternative sequences of
measures over time, avoiding lock-in, and showing decision makers
that there are several possible pathways leading to the same desired
future (Haasnoot et al., 2012; Haasnoot et al., 2013; Brown et al.,
2014; Werners et al., 2015).
"	Text
"Technically more demanding methods such as real-options analysis
(Dixit et al., 1994), and decision tree analysis (Conrad, 1980), can
also find pathways that are economically efficient in terms of
flexibility and timing of adaptation. There is little application of
these approaches in the SLR literature. For example, Woodward et al.
(2014) applied real-options analysis to determine flood defences
around the Thames Estuary, London, England; Buurman and Babovic
(2016) for climate-proofing drainage networks in Singapore; Dawson
et al. (2018) for coastal rail infrastructure in southern England; and
Kim et al. (2018) for assessing flood defences in southern England.
A requirement for applying real-options analysis and decision tree
analysis is to quantify today how much will have been learned at
a given point in time in the future. The few applications of these
methods to SLR-related decisions in the literature have generally used
ad-hoc assumptions. For example, Woodward et al. (2011) assumed
either perfect learning (ie., in 2040, which SLR trajectory is occurring
will be known) or no learning (i.e., uncertainty ranges and confidence
in these remains as today). Others have derived learning rates from
comparing past progress in SLR projections and then applied these to
the future. An example is given by Dawson et al. (2018) who derive
learning rates from the 2002 and 2009 SLR projections of the UK
Climate Impacts Programme and apply these in real-options analysis.
"	Text
"Four general gaps can be identified in the literature. First, the
generation of SLR information is insufficiently coupled to the use of
this information in decision analysis. This constitutes a limitation, as
different coastal decision contexts require different decision analysis
methods, which in turn require different SLR information. Specifically,
applications of decision analysis methods generally convert existing
sea level information to fit their method, often misinterpreting
the information, making arbitrary assumptions or losing essential
information in the process (Hinkel et al., 2015; Bakker et al., 2017; Van
der Pol and Hinkel, 2018). Second, with the exception of adaptation
pathway analysis, methods of robust and flexible decision making
are under-represented in the literature despite their suitability (Van
der Pol and Hinkel, 2018). Third, research is necessary to compare
the various methods, to identity which methods are most suitable in
which context and to develop consistent categorisations of methods
(Hallegatte et al., 2012; Haasnoot et al., 2013; Hinkel et al., 2015;
Watkiss et al., 2015; Dittrich et al., 2016; Suckall et al., 2018). Fourth,
future research needs to address how to embed decision analysis
better in real world planning and decision making processes,
recognising that adaptation to SLR is a multi-stakeholder process
often characterised by conflicting interests and interdependence
between stakeholders (Section 4.4.3). Addressing these gaps
requires closer cooperation between SLR sciences, decision science,
and planning and governance scholars. An underlying challenge is
to design and integrate relevant formal decision making approaches
into the heterogeneous reality of local planning and decision
making cultures, institutions, processes and practices, often with
community-specific needs and requirements (see Box 4.4).

"A community-based and science-informed decision making process

New Zealand is applying tools for decision making under deep uncertainty (Lawrence and Haasnoot, 2017; Lawrence et al., 2019)
to address the changing risk and uncertainties related to SLR impacts on coastal settlements. An opportunity arose in 2017 for
the Resilience to Nature's Challenges National Science Challenge, “The Living Edge” research project (https://resiliencechallenge.
nz/edge), to co-develop a Coastal Hazards Strategy for the Clifton to Tangoio coast in Hawkes Bay, New Zealand. The Strategy,
a joint council/ community/ iwi Maori initiative (Kench et al., 2018), planned to use Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) within
their decision framework — a static tool in time and space, unsuited for decision making where changing risk and uncertainties exist
over long timeframes. The Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (Haasnoot et al., 2013) approach and a modified Real Options Analysis
were proposed by the ‘Edge Team’ and integrated with MCDA (Lawrence et al., 2019) in a process comprising a Technical Advisory
Group of councils and two community panels of directly affected communities, infrastructure agencies, business, conservation interests,
and iwi Maori. Many adaptation options and pathways were assessed for their ability to reduce risk exposure and maintain flexibility
for switching pathways over a 100-year timeframe, which is the planning timeframe mandated by the New Zealand Coastal Policy
Statement (Minister of Conservation, 2010) with the force of law under the Resource Management Act, 1991. The recently revised
New Zealand national coastal hazards and climate change guidance for local government (Bell et al, 2017a) provided context. This
novel assessment, engagement and planning approach to the formulation of a Coastal Hazards Strategy was undertaken through a
non-statutory planning process. The agreed options and pathways have yet to be implemented through statutory processes that will
test the risk tolerance of the wider community. This example illustrates how tailor-made assessment that addresses SLR uncertainty
and change by keeping options open and reducing path-dependency, and engagement and planning processes can be initiated with
leadership across councils, sectors and stakeholders, before being implemented, thus reducing contestation. Lessons learned include
the central role of: leadership, governance and iwi Maori; Local Authority collaboration; taking time to build trust; independent
knowledge brokers for credibility; nuanced project leadership and facilitation, enabling a community-based process. The preferred
intervention options and pathways have been agreed for implementation. The remaining challenges are to cost the range of actions,
decide funding formulae, develop physical and socioeconomic signals and triggers for monitoring changing risk, embed the strategy
in statutory plans and practices, and socialise the strategy with the wider public in the context of competing priorities.

Communities of the Inuvialuit Settlement Region (ISR), established under the Inuvialuit Final Agreement (Government of Canada,
1984), include the delta communities of Aklavik and Inuvik (the regional hub) and the coastal hamlets of Tuktoyaktuk, Paulatuk, Sachs
Harbour, and Ulukhaktok. The Inuvialuit Regional Corporation (IRC) administers Inuvialuit lands, a portfolio of businesses, and social and
cultural services, including co-management of food harvest resources. Other social, education, health, and infrastructure services are
managed by the Government of the Northwest Territories and municipal Councils. Community Corporations and Hunters and Trappers
Committees handle other aspects of governance and socioeconomic development. Very high ground-ice content renders the coast and
coastal infrastructure in this region sensitive to rising temperatures and largely precludes conventional hard shore protection. Higher
temperatures (>3°C rise since 1948), combined with rising sea level and a lengthening open-water season, contribute to accelerating
coastal erosion, threatening infrastructure, cultural resources, and the long-term viability of Tuktoyaktuk Harbour, while impacting
winter travel on ice, access to subsistence resources, food security, safety and well-being (Lamoureux et al., 2015). Despite ongoing
shore recession, there is strong attachment to the most vulnerable sites and a reluctance to relocate. Adaptation challenges include
technical issues (e.g., the ice-rich substrate, sea ice impacts), high transportation costs (until recent completion of an all-weather road
to Tuktoyaktuk, heavy or bulky material had to come in by sea or ice road), availability of experienced labour, and, crucially, financial
resources. Other inhibitors of adaptation include access to knowledge in suitable forms for uptake, gaps in understanding, research
readiness, and institutional barriers related to multiple levels of decision making (Ford et al., 2016a). The IRC, as the indigenous
leadership organisation in the ISR, is moving to play a more proactive role in driving adaptation at the regional level (IRC, 2016),
as indigenous leaders across the country are demanding more control of the northern research agenda for adaptation action (Bell,
2016; ITK, 2018). For a number of years, IRC has promoted community-based monitoring, incorporating Inuvialuit knowledge in
partnership with trusted research collaborators. Recently IRC is exploring partnership with the community-based ice awareness service
and social enterprise, SmartICE Inc. Despite the inherent adaptability of Inuit culture, concentration in locality bound communities
dependent on physical infrastructure has increased vulnerability, as changing climate has raised exposure. Various government and
academic initiatives and tools over many years to promote resilience and adaptation strategies have had limited impact. Current
engagement supporting locally driven knowledge acquisition and management capacity, combined with IRC institutional leadership
with government support, are expected to enable a more effective co-designed and co-delivered adaptation agenda.

change and SLR at the coast. Some salient enabling conditions and
lessons learnt are illustrated in Table 4.9 through case studies or

around the world, structured according to the five overarching SLR
governance challenges identified in Section 4.4.3. In these cases,
the following stands out as being foundational for enabling the
implementation of SLR responses and addressing the governance
challenges that arise. First, effective SLR responses take a long-term
perspective (e.g., 100 years and beyond) and explicitly account for the
uncertainty of locality-specific risks beyond 2050. Second, given the
"	Text
"locality-specific but cross-cutting nature of SLR impacts, improving
cross-scale and cross-domain coordination of SLR responses may
be beneficial. Third, prioritising social vulnerability and equity in SLR
responses may be essential because SLR impacts and risks are spread
unevenly across society, and within and between coastal communities.
Fourth, safe community arenas for working together constructively can
help to resolve social conflict arising from SLR. Fifth, a sharp increase
may be needed in governance capabilities to tackle the complex
problems caused by SLR. There is, however, no one-size-fits-all solution
to SLR, and responses need to be tailored to the environmental, social,
economic, political, technological, and cultural context in which they
are to be implemented. Enablers that work in one context might not
be effective in another case. As sea level rises, more experience in
addressing SLR governance challenges will be gained, which can in
turn be evaluated in order to obtain a better contextual understanding
of enabling conditions and effective SLR governance.

ment in high risk areas is much easier than dealing with existing assets at risk (Tuts et al., 2015; OECD, 2019)

Proactive managed retreat through flexible, tailor-made provisions that address distinctive local circ
stances is under way in, for example, USA and Australia, revealing the importance of understanding risks polit
cians face from local opposition, and distributional impacts (Dyckman et al., 2014; Gibbs, 2016; Siders, 2019). Pc
Hurricane Sandy managed retreat from Staten Island, New York City, USA, was enabled by community receptivit
to buyouts and political expedience (Koslov, 2019; Box 4.1). Lessons include:

— Limit new development commitments in high risk areas

— Facilitate property abandonment as inundation occurs

— Leverage the window of opportunity coastal disasters create (Kousky, 2014)

Lessons learned in building governance capabilities to deal with associated complex problems include (Dewulf and
Termeer, 2015; Bloemen et al., 2018; Bloemen et al., 2019):
— Committing to long-term policy implementation at Cabinet level
— Allocate necessary dedicated budget and build capacity of government agencies to tackle complex problems,

for example, Senate resolution and programme uniting government and knowledge institutes on adaptation

A EET

— Flexible and robust governance approaches and solutions build resilience, for example, independent programme
alongside traditional administrative structures is more agile

— Adaptation pathways help overcome the temporal mismatch between short-term decisions and long-term goals,
explicitly accounting for uncertainty

— Enabling provisions for fit-for-purpose local-level policy and practice are key to translating national programme
goals into local action, for example, liaison officers can bridge local, regional and national decision making arenas

— Institutionalise monitoring and lesson learning (e.g., annual reporting to parliament, forums for politicians to
share experiences) to track progress, deal with multiple legitimate perspectives and tackle emergent problems

— Responsive governance arrangements address competing demands legitimately and timeously, for example,
steering groups, workshops and social media reveal stakeholder concerns

— Policy deadlocks or lock-in due to vested interests or short-term priorities can be tackled by taking a long-term
perspective, exploring alternative scenarios and incentivising novel solutions

"In this context, AR5 put forward the vision of Climate Resilient
Development Pathways, which is “a continuing process for
managing changes in the climate and other driving forces affecting
development, combining flexibility, innovativeness, and participative
problem solving with effectiveness in mitigating and adapting to
climate change” (Denton et al., 2014: 1106). Charting Climate
Resilient Development Pathways in the face of rising sea level
depends on how well mitigation, adaption and other sustainable
development efforts are combined, and the governance challenges
introduced by SLR are resolved. There are no panaceas for solving
these complex issues. However, the wise application of the planning,
public participation, conflict resolution, and decision analysis
methods assessed above can help coastal communities, cities and
settlements develop locally relevant, enabling and adaptive SLR
responses. Difficult social choices will nonetheless need to be made
as sea levels continue to rise. Given the SLR projections outlined here,
it is concluded that global resilience and sustainability prospects
depend, to a large extent, on how effectively coastal communities
develop and implement ambitious, forward-looking adaptation plans
in synchrony with drastic mitigation of GHG emissions.
"	Text
"Our assessment shows that failure to mitigate GHG emissions or to
adapt to SLR will cause major disruptions to many low-lying coastal
communities and jeopardise achievement of all UN SDGs and other
societal aspirations. Immediate and ambitious GHG emissions
reduction is necessary (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018) to contain the
rate and magnitude of SLR, and consequently adaptation prospects.
Under unmitigated emissions (RCP8.5), coastal societies, especially
poorer, rural and small islands societies, will struggle to maintain
their livelihoods and settlements during the 21st century (Sections
4.3.4; 4.4.2). Without mitigation, sea levels will continue to rise for
centuries, reaching 2.3-5.4 m by 2300 (likely range) and much more
beyond (Section 4.2.3.5), making adaptation extremely challenging,
if not impossible, for all low-lying coasts, including more intensively
developed urbanised coasts. But even with ambitious mitigation
(RCP2.6), sea levels will continue to rise, reaching 0.6-1.1 m by 2300
(likely range; Figure 4.2 Panel B). Hence, adaptation will continue
to be imperative irrespective of the uncertainties about future GHG
emissions and key physical processes such as those determining the
Antarctic contribution to SLR. Our assessment also shows that all types
of responses, from hard protection to EbA, advance and retreat, have
important and synergistic roles to play in an integrated and sequenced
response to SLR. The merits of a particular type of response, at a
particular point in time, critically depends on the biophysical, cultural,
economic, technical, institutional and political context.
"	Text
"What challenges does the inevitability of sea level rise present to coastal communities
and how can communities adapt?
"	Title
"Choices being made now about how to respond to SLR profoundly influence the trajectory of future exposure
and vulnerability to SLR. If concerted emissions mitigation is delayed, risks will progressively increase as SLR
accelerates. Prospects for global climate-resilience and sustainable development therefore depend in large part
on coastal nations, cities and communities taking urgent and sustained locally-appropriate action to mitigate
GHG emissions and adapt to SLR.
"	Text
"As the global climate changes, rising sea levels, combined with high tides, storms and flooding, put coastal and island
communities increasingly at risk. Protection can be achieved by building dikes or seawalls and by maintaining natural features
like mangroves or coral reefs. Communities can also adjust by reclaiming land from the sea and adapting buildings to cope
with floods. However, all measures have their limits, and once these are reached people may ultimately have to retreat.
Choices made today influence how coastal ecosystems and communities can respond to sea level rise (SLR) in the future.
Reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions would not just reduce risks, but also open up more adaptation options.
"	Text
"Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) is rising and it will continue to do so for centuries. Sustainable development
aspirations are at risk because many people, assets and vital resources are concentrated along low-lying coasts
around the world. Many coastal communities have started to consider the implications of SLR. Measures are
being taken to address coastal hazards exacerbated by rising sea level, such as coastal flooding due to extreme
events (e.g. storm surges, tropical cyclones, coastal erosion and salinisation). However, many coastal communities
are still not sufficiently adapted to today’s ESLs.
"	Text
"For those unable to afford protection, accommodation or advance measures, or when such measures are no
longer viable or effective, retreat becomes inevitable. Millions of people living on low-lying islands face this
prospect, including inhabitants of Small Island Developing States (SIDS), of some densely populated but less
intensively developed deltas, of rural coastal villages and towns, and of Arctic communities who already face
melting sea ice and unprecedented changes in weather. The resultant impacts on distinctive cultures and ways
of life could be devastating. Difficult trade-offs are therefore inevitable when making social choices about rising
sea level. Institutionalising processes that lead to fair and just outcomes is challenging, but vitally important.
"	Text
"Scientific evidence about SLR is clear: GMSL rose by 1.5 mm yr""! during the period 1901-1990, accelerating to
3.6 mm yr during the period 2005-2015. It is likely to rise 0.61-1.10 m by 2100 if global GHG emissions are not
mitigated (RCP8.5). However, a rise of two or more metres cannot be ruled out. It could rise to more than 3 m
by 2300, depending on the level of GHG emissions and the response of the AIS, which are both highly uncertain.
Even if efforts to mitigate emissions are very effective, ESL events that were rare over the last century will
become common before 2100, and even by 2050 in many locations. Without ambitious adaptation, the combined
impact of hazards like coastal storms and very high tides will drastically increase the frequency and severity of
flooding on low-lying coasts.
"	Text
"SLR, as well as the context for adaptation, will vary regionally and locally, thus action to reduce risks related
to SLR takes different forms depending on the local circumstances. ‘Hard protection’, like dikes and seawalls,
can effectively reduce risk under two or more metres of SLR but it is inevitable that limits will be reached. Such
protection produces benefits that exceed its costs in low-lying coastal areas that are densely populated, as is the
case for many coastal cities and some small islands, but in general, poorer regions will not be able to afford hard
protection. Maintaining healthy coastal ecosystems, like mangroves, seagrass beds or coral reefs, can provide ‘soft
protection’ and other benefits. SLR can also be ‘accommodated’ by raising buildings on the shoreline, for example.
Land can be reclaimed from the sea by building outwards and upwards. In coastal locations where the risk is very
high and cannot be effectively reduced, ‘retreat’ from the shoreline is the only way to eliminate such risk. Avoiding
new development commitments in areas exposed to coastal hazards and SLR also avoids additional risk.

In response to ocean warming and increased stratification,
open ocean nutrient cycles are being perturbed and there
is high confidence that this is having a regionally variable
impact on primary producers. There is currently low confidence
in appraising past open ocean productivity trends, including those
determined by satellites, due to newly identified region-specific
drivers of microbial growth and the lack of corroborating jn situ time
series datasets. {5.2.2.5, 5.2.2.6}

"Multiple datasets and models show that the rate of ocean
uptake of atmospheric CO, has continued to strengthen
in the recent two decades in response to the increasing
concentration of CO, in the atmosphere. The very likely range
for ocean uptake is between 20-30% of total anthropogenic
emissions in the recent two decades. Evidence is growing that the
ocean carbon sink is dynamic on decadal timescales, especially
in the Southern Ocean, which has affected the total global ocean
carbon sink (medium confidence). {5.2.2.3}

"Carbon emissions from human activities are causing ocean
warming, acidification and oxygen loss with some evidence
of changes in nutrient cycling and primary production. The
warming ocean is affecting marine organisms at multiple
trophic levels, impacting fisheries with implications for food
production and human communities. Concerns regarding the
effectiveness of existing ocean and fisheries governance
have already been reported, highlighting the need for timely
mitigation and adaptation responses.

"The ocean is continuing to acidify in response to ongoing ocean

declining (virtually certain) by a very likely range of 0.017—0.027 pH
units per decade since the late 1980s across individual time series
observations longer than 15 years. The anthropogenic pH signal is very
likely to have emerged for three-quarters of the near-surface open
ocean prior to 1950 and it is very likely that over 95% of the near
surface open ocean has already been affected. These changes in pH
have reduced the stability of mineral forms of calcium carbonate due
to a lowering of carbonate ion concentrations, most notably in the
upwelling and high-latitude regions of the ocean. {5.2.2.3, Box 5.1}

"There is a growing consensus that the open ocean is losing
oxygen overall with a very likely loss of 0.5-3.3% between
1970-2010 from the ocean surface to 1000 m (medium
confidence). Globally, the oxygen loss due to warming is reinforced by
other processes associated with ocean physics and biogeochemistry,
which cause the majority of the observed oxygen decline (high
confidence). The oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) are expanding by
a very likely range of 3-8%, most notably in the tropical oceans, but
there is substantial decadal variability that affects the attribution
of the overall oxygen declines to human activity in tropical regions

In this Report, the following terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or a result: Virtually certain 99—100% probability, Very likely 90-100%,
Likely 66-100%, About as likely as not 33-66%, Unlikely 0-33%, Very unlikely 0-10%, and Exceptionally unlikely 0-1%. Additional terms (Extremely likely: 95—100%, More
likely than not >50-100%, and Extremely unlikely 0-5%) may also be used when appropriate. Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics, e.g., very likely (see Section 1.9.2 and
Figure 1.4 for more details). This Report also uses the term ‘likely range’ to indicate that the assessed likelihood of an outcome lies within the 17-83% probability range.

In this Report, the following summary terms are used to describe the available evidence: limited, medium, or robust; and for the degree of agreement: low, medium, or high.
A level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers: very low, low, medium, high, and very high, and typeset in italics, e.g., medium confidence. For a given evidence and
agreement statement, different confidence levels can be assigned, but increasing levels of evidence and degrees of agreement are correlated with increasing confidence
(see Section 1.9.2 and Figure 1.4 for more details).

ocean chemistry such as acidification and oxygen loss, as documented
in the ARS (Rhein et al. 2013). The global scale warming and
acidification trends are readily detectable in oceanic observations,
well understood scientifically, and consistently projected by ESMs.
Each of these has been directly attributed to anthropogenic forcing
from changing concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols
(Bindoff et al. 2013). These trends in the global average ocean
temperature will continue for centuries after the anthropogenic

of Global Warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and related
global greenhouse gas emission pathways (SR15) also concluded
that reducing these risks by ‘limiting warming to 1.5°C above
pre-industrial levels would require transformative systemic change,
integrated with sustainable development’ and that ‘adaptation needs

"The ocean is a key component of the Earth system (Chapter 1) as
it provides essential life supporting services (Inniss et al. 2017).
For example, it stores heat trapped in the atmosphere caused by
increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases, it masks and slows
surface warming, it stores excess carbon dioxide and is an important
component of global biogeochemical cycles. The ocean is the home
to the largest continuous ecosystem, provides habitats for rich marine
biodiversity, is an essential source of food and contributes to human
health, livelihood and security. The ocean also supports other services
to humans, for example, transport and trade, tourism, renewable
energy, and cultural services such as aesthetic appeal, local and
traditional knowledge and religious practices. Governance of the ocean
has a unique set of challenges and opportunities compared with land
systems and requiring different treatment under a changing climate.

"The impacts on ocean ecosystems and human societies are primarily
driven by regional trends and by the local manifestation of the global-
scale changes. At these smaller scales, the temperature, acidification,
salinity, nutrient and oxygen concentrations in the ocean are also
expected to exhibit basin and local-scale changes. However, the ocean
also has significant natural variability at basin and local-scales with
time scales from minutes to decades and longer (Rhein et al. 2013),
which can mask the underlying observed and projected trends (see
Box 5.1). The impact of multiple stressors on marine ecosystems is one
of the main subjects of this chapter (Section 5.2.3, 5.2.4, 5.3), including
new evidence and understanding since the last assessment report
(e.g., Gunderson et al. 2016). The most severe impacts of a changing
climate will typically be experienced when conditions are driven
outside the range of previous experience at rates that are faster than
human or ecological systems can adapt (Pértner et al. 2014; Box 5.1).

anthropogenic changes to the radiative properties of the atmosphere

an increase in ocean temperature (Figure 5.1). This temperature
increase corresponds to an uptake of over 90% of the excess heat
accumulated in the Earth system over this period (Bindoff et al. 2013;
Rhein et al. 2013). This heat in the ocean also causes it to expand and

update the estimates for ocean heat uptake (Table 5.1, and $M5.1).
For all of the periods assessed in Table 5.1, it is virtually certain
that the upper ocean (0-700 m) has warmed. These results are
consistent with earlier research into the duration of record needed
to detect a significant signal in global ocean heat content (Gleckler

the ocean temperature data means we can detect discernable rates
of increase in ocean heat uptake (Gleckler et al. 2012; Cheng et al.

likely higher in the 1993-2017 (or 2005-2017) period compared with

"Historically, scientific research expeditions starting in the 19th century
have provided occasional sections measuring deep ocean properties

temperatures down to about 700 m was obtained using expendable
bathythermographs along commercial shipping tracks starting in the
1970s (Abraham et al. 2013). Since the early 2000s, thousands of
autonomous profiling floats (Argo floats) have provided high-quality
temperature and salinity profiles of the upper 2000 m in ice-free
regions of the ocean (Abraham et al. 2013; Riser et al. 2016). Further
advances in autonomous floats have been developed that now allow
these floats to operate in seasonally ice covered oceans (Wong and
Riser, 2011; Wong and Riser, 2013), and more recently to profile the
entire depth of the water column down to 4000 or 6000 m (Johnson

"5 Following common oceanographic practice dating back to Helland-Hansen (1916) and discussed in detail by Sverdrup et al. (1942), an ocean water-mass is defined as
a large volume of seawater with a characteristic range of temperature and salinity properties, typically falling along a line in temperature-salinity space, often with common
formation processes and locations.

the climate system from the surface into the interior ocean and between
ocean basins. Individual realisations of ESMs do show decades with
slow increases in mean surface temperature change comparable to
what was observed, even though these cases exhibit continued interior
ocean heat uptake, and every ensemble member exhibits surface
warming closer to the ensemble-mean over multi-decadal timescales

"Projected salinity changes in the subsurface ocean reflect changes
in the rates of formation of water masses or their newly formed
properties (Purich et al. 2018). Thus, projected freshening of the
Southern Ocean surface leads to a freshening of the Antarctic
Intermediate Water that is subducted there, flowing northward from
the Southern Ocean as a relatively fresh water-mass at depths of
500-1500 m (Figure 5.3b). Increased surface salinity in the Atlantic
subtropical gyres are pumped into the interior by the winds, leading
to an increased salinity of the interior subtropical gyres, along with
contributions from increasingly salty Mediterranean water (Jorda
et al. 2017). Conversely, freshwater capping of the northwestern
north Atlantic is projected to inhibit deep convection in the Labrador
Sea and the consequent production of Labrador Sea Water in some
models (Collins et al. 2013), and contributes to the increased salinity
of the north Atlantic between 1000-2000 m depths (Figure 5.3b).

"The near surface salinity of the ocean is both observed and projected
to evolve in ways that reflect the increased intensity of the Earth's
hydrologic cycle (Durack, 2015) and the increasing near-surface ocean
stratification (Zika et al. 2018). As described in WGI ARS, the ocean
surface in areas that currently have net evaporation are expected to
become saltier, while areas with net precipitation are expected to get
fresher (Rhein et al. 2013), as the patterns of precipitation and
evaporation are generally expected to be amplified (Held and Soden,
2006). At longer time-scales of decades, the larger scale changes in
the ocean circulation and basin integrated freshwater imbalances
emerge in the near-surface salinity changes, as shown in Figure 5.3b,
with an increasingly salty tropical and subtropical Atlantic and
Mediterranean contrasting with a freshening Pacific and polar Arctic
emerging as robust signals across the suite of ESMs (Collins et al.
2013). The freshening of the high latitudes in the north Atlantic and
Arctic basin is consistent with the widely expected weakening of the
AMOC (also discussed in Section 6.7), hydrological cycle changes and
a decline in the volume of sea ice (discussed in Section 3.2.2).

"The ocean will continue to take up heat in the coming decades for
all plausible scenarios. As depicted in Figure 5.1, the ensemble of
CMIP5 ESMs used by Cheng et al. (2019) project that under RCP2.6,
the top 2000 m of the ocean will take up 935 ZJ of heat between 2015
and 2100 (with a very likely range of 650-1340 ZJ based on the 5th
and 95th percentiles of the 25 ESMs used here that have available
data from the historical, scenario and control runs for RCP2.6). Under
RCP8.5 this ensemble projects heat uptake of 2180 ZJ (with a very
likely range of 1710-2790 ZJ, based on 35 ESMs) between 2015 and
2100. By 2100 the ocean is very likely to warm by 2 to 4 times as
much for low emissions (RCP2.6) and 5 to 7 times as much for the high
emissions scenario (RCP8.5) compared with the observed changes
since 1970. With the RCP8.5 scenario, the ocean is very likely to take up
about twice as much heat as RCP2.6 (Figure. 5.1). Even under RCP2.6
the ocean will continue to warm for several centuries to come (Collins
et al. 2013). It is virtually certain that the ocean will continue to take up
heat throughout the 21st century, and the rate of uptake will depend
upon on the emissions scenario we collectively choose to follow.

"The ensemble average of the CMIP5 ESMs projects widespread ocean
warming over the coming century, concentrated in the upper ocean
(Figures 5.2c and 5.3) (Kuhlbrodt and Gregory, 2012). The anthropogenic
heat will penetrate into the ocean following well-established circulation
pathways (Jones et al. 2016a). The greatest vertically integrated heat
uptake occurs where there is already the formation of interior waters,
such as Antarctic Intermediate Water along the Antarctic Circumpolar
Current (Frdlicher et al. 2015) or NADW precursors in the Nordic Seas
(Figure 5.2c), but all water-masses® that are subducted over decades
are expected to experience significant warming (see Figure 5.3). The
warming in the subtropical gyres penetrates deeper into the ocean
than other gyres (roughly 15°N-45°N and 15°S—45°S in Figure 5.3),
following the wind-driven bowing down of the density surfaces (the
solid lines in Figure 5.3) in these gyres (Terada and Minobe, 2018).
The greater warming at 700-2000 m in the Atlantic than the Pacific
or Indian Oceans (Figure 5.3) reflects the strong southward transport
of recently formed NADW at these depths by the AMOC. Two areas
that commonly exhibit substantially reduced near-surface warming
over the course of the 21st century are the northern north Atlantic,
where a slowing AMOC (see Section 6.7.1.1) reduces the northward

and cooling trends in the tropical Pacific and Indian oceans can arise

Dipole variability (Han et al. 2014). Large ensembles of freely running
CMIP5 ESM simulations also show that internal variability can
dominate the regional manifestation of the anthropogenic climate
signal on decadal timescales (Kay et al. 2014). This is illustrated by the
differing warming trends in Figure 5.2e and 5.2f from two identical
ESMs that differ only in the weather in their 1850 initial conditions,
averaged over the whole 21st century, by contrast, the ensemble of
CMIP5 models project statistically significant anthropogenic regional

"Since ARS, the use of different and updated oceanographic data sets
and increase in the number of ensembles of the CMIP5 simulations
(Kay et al. 2014) has improved the overall detection and attribution of
human influence. Together these measures increase the coherence of
the simulations and reduce noise. For example, an isotherm approach
used to reduce the noise from the displacement of isotherms in the
upper water column allowing detection in each of the mid-latitude
ocean basins was achieved on 60-year time series (Weller et al. 2016).
Using all the available ocean temperature and salinity profiles from
the Southern Ocean, Swart et al. (2018) show that the warming and
freshening patterns were consistent primarily with increased human
induced greenhouse gases and secondarily from ozone depletion in
the stratosphere, but inconsistent with internal variability. Together
the evidence from the ARS, and the discussion above with the new
evidence on regional scales across the global oceans, we conclude that
the observed long-term upper ocean temperature changes are very
likely to have a substantial contribution from anthropogenic forcing.

"There are well documented changes in observed ocean temperatures
and salinities (Abraham et al. 2013; Ishii et al. 2017). However,
attributing these changes in the state of the ocean to anthropogenic
causes can be challenging due to the presence of internally generated
variability, which can swamp the underlying climate change signal in
short records and on regional scales. As can be seen in Figure 5.2, the
observed long-term trends (Figure 5.2a) exhibit a striking similarity
to the CMIP5 ensemble mean in areas where the models suggest
that anthropogenic changes should be statistically significant
(Figure 5.2b). However, the trends in the shorter well-observed
period covering 2005-2017 (Figure 5.2d) exhibits strong trends from
internal variability, as illustrated by the differences of two ensemble
members of the same ESM with the same forcing but initialised with
different weather (Figure 5.2e and 5.2f). Detection and Attribution
studies take the internal variability into account and separate the
underlying climate signals with the same spatio-temporal sampling
as the observations, and apply a range of statistical tests to determine
the coherence of the observations with the co-sampled observations
(Bindoff et al. 2013; ARS WG1 Box 10.1).

"Large-scale patterns of natural variability at interannual to decadal
time scales can mask the long-term warming trend in the upper
700 m, particularly in the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans (England
et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2016) and in the north Atlantic (Buckley and
Marshall, 2015). The most significant upper 700 m warming between
five-year averages centered on 2007-2015 occurred in a large
extratropical band of the Southern Hemisphere between 30°S-60°S,
and in the tropical Indian Ocean, the eastern North Pacific and western
subtropical north Atlantic (Figure 5.2d). Warming of the southern
hemisphere subtropical gyres is driven, in part, by an intensification of
Southern Ocean winds in recent decades, facilitating the penetration
of heat to deeper depths (Gao et al. 2018). Marginal seas, such as the
Mediterranean and Red seas have also exhibited notable warming.
Conversely, over this timeframe there were also regions of cooling
in the upper 700 m, notably in the north Atlantic around 40°N—-60°N
and in the western tropical Pacific (Figure 5.2d). Recent relatively
cold and fresh surface and subsurface conditions in the north Atlantic
have been attributed to anomalous atmospheric forcing (Josey et al.
2018) or weakened transport by the north Atlantic Current and
AMOC (Smeed et al. 2018), and in turn may have contributed to an
intensification of deep convection in the Labrador Sea since 2012
(Yashayaev and Loder, 2017). All these observed decadal changes
can be related to internal decadal variability (Robson et al. 2014;

"Detailed regional patterns of trends in temperature and heat content
at depths of 0-2000 m during the early 21st century are consistent
in various analysis, owing to the improved observing network
(Roemmich et al. 2015; Desbruyéres et al. 2016a) (Figure 5.2d). At
depths of 700-2000 m, observations in all of the ocean basins show
broadly warming trends in the well-observed Argo era (2006 to
present), with particularly significant warming patterns in the
Southern Hemisphere extratropics around 40°S and the subpolar
north Atlantic (Figure 5.3a). These observed changes support
the notion that deep ocean heat content has been continuously
increasing. As a result, regional climate change signatures emerge
from confounding natural variability sooner in the 700-2000 m
depth range than in upper 700 m of the ocean, where interannual
modes of variability have a larger influence on the circulation (for
a more complete discussion see Johnson et al. (2018)). Despite
regional patches of cooling water in the upper 700 m (Figure 5.2d),
every one of the world’s ocean basins volume averaged over
depths of 0-2000 m has experienced significant warming over
the last decade (Figure 5.3, and also Desbruyéres et al. (2016a)).
The greatest warming of the top 2000 m has been in the Southern
Ocean (Roemmich et al. 2015; Trenberth et al. 2016), the tropical
and subtropical Pacific Ocean (Roemmich et al. 2015), and the
tropical and subtropical Atlantic Ocean (Cheng and Chen, 2017). The
Southern Hemisphere extratropical oceans accounted for 67-98% of
the total ocean heat increase in the uppermost 2000 m for the period
of 2006-2013 (Roemmich et al. 2015). Shi et al. (2018) suggest that
the dominant ocean heat uptake by the Southern Hemisphere in the
early 21st century is expected to become more balanced between
the hemispheres as the asymmetric cooling by aerosols decreases.

Regions of the ocean fed by AABW from the Weddell Sea have
exhibited a possible slowdown in local AABW warming rates (Lyman

along with significant differences between various ESMs, limits our
understanding of the exact mechanisms driving the abyssal ocean
variability. However, ESMs consistently predict an anthropogenic
climate-change induced long-term abyssal warming trend originating
in the Southern Ocean due to a reduction in the formation rates of
cold AABW (Heuzé et al. 2015). Although the abyssal modes of natural
variability are not as pronounced as closer to the surface, deep ocean
heat content can vary on relatively short time scales through the
communication of topographic and planetary waves driven by changes

"To date, assessment of deep ocean (below 2000 m) heat content has
mostly been from ship-based data collected along decadal repeats

relatively sparse in space and time compared to the upper ocean,
these transects were positioned to optimise sampling of most deep
ocean basins and provide the highest quality of salinity, temperature
and pressure data. Argo floats capable of sampling to 6000 m have
just started to populate select deep ocean basins; this Deep Argo data
has just started providing regional deep ocean warming estimates

Argo array (iohnson et al. 2015), complemented by indirect estimates

natural variability at inter-annual (e.g., El Nifio) to decadal (e.g., the
Pacific Decadal Oscillation) timescales. The Antarctic Circumpolar
Current is projected to be subject to strengthening westerly winds
and substantially reduced rates of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW)
formation, as assessed in the Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3. The
heat transported by the buoyancy-loss driven AMOC, in particular,
contributes to the relatively clement climate of northern Europe and
the north Atlantic Basin as a whole, although the wind-driven ocean
gyres also contribute to the meridional ocean heat transport (see the
review by Buckley and Marshall (2015)). As a result, there is a concern
that significant changes in ocean circulation could lead to localised
climate changes that are much larger than the global mean. Projected
and observed changes in the AMOC and the rates of formation of deep
water-masses in the north Atlantic are discussed in Chapter 6.7.1,
along with the possibility of abrupt or enduring changes resulting from
forcing by Greenlandic meltwater. A significant reduction in AMOC
would, in turn, modestly weaken the Gulf Stream transport, which also
has a substantial wind driven component (Frajka-Williams et al. 2016).
Most aspects of the large-scale wind-driven ocean circulation are very
likely to be qualitatively similar to the circulation in the present day,
with only modest changes in transports and current location.

"intensified warming and near-surface freshening at high latitudes
leading to a projection of more intense near-surface stratification
(the downward-increasing vertical gradient of density) across all
ocean basins (Figures 5.3 and 5.5) is a robust result with a high
agreement across successive generations of coupled climate models
(Capotondi et al. 2012; Bopp et al. 2013). Based on the projected
changes from individual models between 1986-2005 and 2081-
2100, the mean stratification of the upper 200 m averaged between
60°S-60°N, normalised by the ensemble mean value from 1986-2005
will very likely increase by between 1.0—9.3% (with 95% confidence
and a CMIP5 median change of 2.6%) for RCP2.6, and by between
12.2-30.0% (median value 21.2%) for RCP8.5. Inferences from
oceanic observations (Good et al. 2013) suggest that the 20-year
mean stratification averaged between 60°S—60°N and over the top
200 m very likely increased by between 2.18-2.42% from 1971-1990
to 1998-2017. By contrast, the bottom intensified warming in the
abyss (see Figure 5.4) which is consistent with a slowing in the
rate of AABW formation, is also associated with a reduction in
the abyssal stratification of the ocean (Lyman and Johnson, 2014;
Desbruyéres et al. 2016b). Both of these changes have consequences
for the evolving turbulence and ocean water-mass structure. Based
on observational evidence, theoretical understanding and robust
ESM projections, it is very likely that stratification in the upper few
hundred meters of the ocean below the mixed layer will increase
significantly in the 21st century over most ocean basins as a result of
climate change, and abyssal stratification will likely decrease.

"Masuda et al. 2010; Spence et al. 2017). AABW has shown variability in
properties and production rates over the past half century (Purkey and
Johnson, 2013; Menezes et al. 2017). A slowdown in AABW formation
rates may arise from freshening of shelf waters, changes in local
winds driving cross shelf mixing, or larger scale dynamics controlling
the spin up or down of Southern Ocean gyres influencing the density
of outflowing waters over deep sills. Large-scale circulation changes
can also alter the properties of the ambient water that is entrained as
dense water descends along the Antarctic continental slopes (Spence
et al. 2017). Evolving AABW properties may also reflect changes in
deep Southern Ocean convection. The Weddell Polynya is a large
opening in the wintertime ice of the Weddell Sea that is kept ice-free
despite intense heat loss to the atmosphere by convective mixing
bringing up warm and salty water from the deep ocean. (See Box 3.2
for a more extensive discussion of polynyas and the Weddell Polynya
in particular). The Weddell Polynya was present in three of the
first years of infrared satellite observations of wintertime sea ice
concentrations in the mid-1970s, but it has been closed since 1976,
only to reopen in 2016 and 2017. The prominent Weddell Polynya in
the mid-1970s greatly increased the volume of the coldest waters
in the deep Weddell Sea. Weddell Polynyas are documented to drive
abyssal cold and salty signals and can spread thermal signals as waves
further and faster than could be explained by slow advective signals
(Martin et al. 2015; Zanowski and Hallberg, 2017); these waves do
not directly heat individual water parcels, but instead warm the ocean
where they cause the coldest deep layers to spread laterally and thin.
However, recovery from the large Weddell polynya of the early 1970s
can only explain about 20% of the observed abyssal warming trend
(Zanowski et al. 2015).

"Both human structures and ecological systems in the coastal zone
are directly impacted by tidal amplitudes, which contribute to high-
water levels and the tidal flushing rates of estuaries, embayments,
marshes and mangroves. The tides are the response of a forced-
damped-resonance system (Arbic et al. 2009). The M2 tide is the
dominant tidal constituent in most places, with a period of half
a lunar day, or 12 hours, 25 minutes; the M2 tides are created by the
differential motion of the solid Earth and oceans in response to the
gravitational attraction of the moon (Newton, 1687; Laplace, 1799).
The astronomical forcing evolves only slowly, however the tidal
damping and basin resonance at tidal frequencies can change in
response to changes in sea level, stratification and coastal conditions

"Coastal systems are subject to the same large-scale warming trends
as the open ocean, but the local response may be dominated by
a complex of localised changes in factors such as circulation, mixing,
river plumes or the seasonal upwelling of cold water. Using ESMs
to project how these factors will interact often requires much finer
resolution than is currently affordable in global models, however
regional high-resolution models can be effective, especially in
marginal seas like the Mediterranean with restricted interactions
with the open ocean and that respond primarily to local forcing
(Adloff et al. 2015). High resolution regional models have also been
used to project robust localised ocean climate changes in wide shelf
seas with more extensive interactions with the open ocean, like those
in northwestern Europe (Tinker et al. 2016). The technical difficulties
of using nested regional models are much greater in coasts adjacent
to energetic large-scale currents like the Gulf Stream, Kuroshio, and
Agulhas, and projecting detailed coastal climate change such places
may require the use of expensive high resolution global models (Saba
et al. 2016). These physical coastal changes have consequences that
cascade through ecosystems to people, as is illustrated in detail for
eastern boundary upwelling systems in Box 5.2.

"euphotic zone and increasing the gradient in oxygen concentrations
between the near surface ocean and the interior. Increasing upper
ocean stratification (Figure 5.5) acts to restrict the depth of the
ocean's surface mixed layer. Increasing stratification increases the
buoyancy frequency and the lateral propagation speed of internal
gravity waves and boundary waves by about half the percentage
change of the stratification itself. Increasing stratification increases
both the length of the internal deformation radius (a typical length
scale in baroclinic eddy dynamics) and the horizontal scales of internal
tides (see Section 5.2.2.2.3) proportionately with the changes in the
internal gravity wave speeds. An increase in stratification will increase
the lateral propagation of internal Rossby waves (which set up the
basin-scale ocean density structure) proportionately. For the same
forcing, increasing stratification reduces the geostrophically balanced
slope of density surfaces, and hence the vertical extent of basin-scale
wind-driven gyres or coastal upwelling circulations. The flattening of
density surfaces by increased stratification inhibits advective exchange
between the surface and interior ocean (Wang et al. 2015a), with
consequences for the uptake of anthropogenic carbon (Section 5.2.2.3),
the evolving oxygen distribution (Section 5.2.2.4) and the supply of
nutrients to support primary production (Section 5.2.2.5).

"Because coastal tides are near resonance in many locations, small
changes in sea level and bay shape can change the local tides
significantly. For example, the insertion of tidal power plants can
have a significant impact on the local tides (Ward et al. 2012).
Various observational and modeling studies demonstrate that SLR
has spatial heterogeneous impacts on the tides, with some locations
experiencing decreased tidal amplitudes and others experiencing
increased tidal amplitudes (Pickering et al. 2012; Devlin et al. 2017;
Pickering et al. 2017). Projections of tidal changes indicate that the
patterns and even the sign of changes in tidal amplitudes depend on
whether the coastlines are allowed to recede with rising sea levels
or are held in place (Pickering et al. 2017; Schindelegger et al. 2018).
Pelling et al. (2013) and Hwang et al. (2014) demonstrate that the
rapid coastline changes in China’s Bohai Sea have already altered
the tides in that region and throughout the Yellow Sea (Hwang et al.
2014). Pelling and Green (2014) examine the impact of flood defenses
as well as SLR on tides on the European Shelf. Such tidal changes
have implications for designing flood defenses, for tidal renewable
energy, for tidal flushing timescales of estuaries and embayments,
and for navigational dredging requirements (Pickering et al. 2012)
(Section 5.4.2). The sign and amplitude of local changes to tides
are very likely to be impacted by both human coastal adaptation
measures and climate drivers (listed above).
"	Text
"(Miller, 2012; Schindelegger et al. 2018). Several recent studies have
analysed historical coastal tide gauge data and found amplitude trends
of order 1-4% per century (Ray, 2009; Woodworth, 2010; Miiller
et al. 2011). In some locations, the changes in the tides have been of
comparable importance to changes in mean sea level for explaining
changes in high water levels (jay, 2009). For many individual tide
gauges, the trends in tidal amplitude are strongly positively or
negatively correlated with local time-mean sea level trends (Devlin
et al. 2017). Another source of secular tidal changes, changes in
oceanic stratification, modifies the rate of energy conversion from the
barotropic tides to the internal tides Jayne and St. Laurent, 2001),
the vertical profile of turbulent viscosity on shelves (Miiller, 2012),
and the propagation speed of the internal tides (Zhao, 2016). For
example, Colosi and Munk (2006) found an increase in the amplitude
of the principal lunar semidiurnal tide Mz in Honolulu of about 1 cm
over the past 100 years, which they attributed primarily to changes
in oceanic stratification bringing about local changes in relative
phases of the internal and external M2 tides, increasing constructive
interference. Both sea level and stratification are expected to exhibit
robust secular positive trends in the coming century due to climate
change, at rates that are significantly larger than historical trends, and
people may choose to replace natural beaches and marshes with sea-
walls in response to rising sea levels. As a result, it is very likely that
the majority of coastal regions will experience statistically significant
changes in tidal amplitudes over the course of the 21st century.

many ocean models exhibit the same sign of bias, there is a systematic
warming of the lower-main thermocline that is not cancelled out when
taking the average over the ensemble of all the models in CMIP5. These
biases are widely known within the ocean modelling community, and
various groups are working to reduce these biases in future ESMs
with better ocean model numerics and parameterisations. To correct
for model biases, ESM projections are always taken as the difference
from a control run without the anomalous forcing. However, some
aspects of the ocean response to climate change are nonlinear, and
model biases can introduce uncertainties into climate projections. In
the case of heat uptake, this is of the order of 10% uncertainty, while
for the rate of steric SLR (which depends on the nonlinear equation
of state of seawater) the uncertainty in CMIP5 models is of the order
of 20% (Hallberg et al. 2012).

vertical velocities that drive fluxes of nutrients from the interior

with increased phytoplankton residency time within the euphotic
zone (Lévy et al. 2012). Intense mesoscale eddies are known to
create favourable conditions for sub-mesoscale instabilities as shown
in both observational (Bachman et al. 2017) and numerical studies
(Brannigan et al. 2017). Intensifying Southern Ocean eddy fields will
have a significant local impact on biological productivity, ecosystem
structure, and carbon uptake, both directly and via sub-mesoscale
processes. At typical CMIP5 ESM resolutions, it is only in the tropics
that mesoscale eddies are adequately resolved to explicitly model
their effects (Hallberg, 2013), while sub-mesoscale eddies are not
resolved anywhere, so eddy effects need to be parameterised in ESMs.
Despite great progress over the past 30 years in parameterising eddy
effects, uncertainties in these parameterisations and how eddies will
respond to novel conditions continue to contribute to uncertainties in
projections of oceanic climate change (medium confidence).

the 1980s and 1990 (Talley et al. 2016), alongside the preparation of
a global quality controlled database of ocean interior observations
(Olsen et al. 2016a), have led to progress since AR5 regarding to
the oceanic interior storage of anthropogenic C02. Several studies
analysed the changes in the amount of anthropogenic CO2 that have
accumulated between different occupations in the different ocean
basins (Wanninkhof et al. 2010; Pérez et al. 2013; Woosley et al. 2016;
Carter et al. 2017), confirming that the anthropogenic CO2 taken up
from the atmosphere is transported to depth, where most of it is
stored. Using a newly developed reconstruction method, Gruber et al.
(2019) extended these results to the globe. They find that between
1994 and 2007, across two standard deviations, that the global
ocean has accumulated an additional 30-38 Pg C of anthropogenic
CO2, which is equivalent to an ait-sea CO2 flux of between
2.3-2.9 Pg C yr (coherent with surface ocean CO? observations),

"dissipation rate and the vertical diffusivity, two measures of ocean
turbulence, vary over several orders of magnitude throughout the
ocean (Figure 5.6) (Polzin et al. 1997; Waterman et al. 2012; Whalen
et al. 2012; Alford et al. 2013; Hummels et al. 2013; Sheen et al. 2013;
Waterhouse et al. 2014; Kunze, 2017). For a given energy dissipation rate,
the turbulent diffusivities of heat, salinity, nutrients and other tracers
tend to be smaller with stronger stratification. This dependency on
stratification helps explain why the observationally inferred diffusivity
in the heavily stratified main thermocline (250-1000 m depth) is of
similar magnitude to those deeper in the water column, while the
turbulent energy density and dissipation rate are much stronger at
the shallower depths (Whalen et al. 2012). Oceanic turbulence also
fluctuates in time, is modulated by tidal cycles (Klymak et al. 2008),
the mesoscale eddy field and seasonal changes (Whalen et al. 2018).
In the mixed layer and directly below, turbulence changes according
to local conditions, such as the winds, heating rates and local
stratification (Sloyan et al. 2010; Moum et al. 2013; D’Asaro, 2014;
Tanaka et al. 2015) at diurnal to seasonal and longer timescales. These
variations in near-surface turbulence need to be taken into account
for ESMs to reproduce more accurately the observed seasonal cycle of
surface properties and spatial structure of the depth of the thermally

are expected to change with a + changing climate. Surface wind and
buoyancy forcing, the mean and eddying larger-scale ocean circulation
itself, and the barotropic tides are all thought to be significant
sources of the energy that drives mixing (Wunsch and Ferrari, 2004).
Often this energy first passes through the ocean's pervasive field of
internal gravity waves that propagate and refract through the varying
ocean circulation, often breaking into turbulent mixing far from their
sources (Eden and Olbers, 2014; Alford et al. 2016; Melet et al. 2016;
Meyer et al. 2016; Zhao et al. 2016b). The energy contributing to the
internal waves from the winds and the subsequent turbulence will
be altered by changes in tropical storm activity or sea ice coverage.
For example, the increasing extent of ice-free Arctic Ocean has
already been observed to lead to increased wind-driven internal
waves (Dosser and Rainville, 2016). The Southern Annular Mode is
expected to intensify as a result of climate change (Young et al. 2011;
Jones et al. 2016b), bringing with it stronger winds, and more wind-
energy input over most of the Southern Ocean and a more intense
mesoscale eddy field (Hogg et al. 2015). Changes in the near-bottom
stratification will alter the rate that the barotropic tides generate
internal waves, thereby altering the strength and distribution of the
tidally generated mixing. Some of the parameterisations of interior
ocean mixing used in CMIP5 ESMs take some changing turbulent
energy sources into account (Jayne and St. Laurent, 2001), and more
comprehensive mixing treatments are being developed for use in
future generations of ESMs (Eden and Olbers, 2014). However, not
all of the physical processes leading to the rich structure of mixing
shown in Figure 5.6 are well understood or included in ESMs; the
prospect of significant changes in the patterns and intensity of ocean
turbulent mixing is a potential source of uncertainty (probably at

undersaturated conditions in CMIP5 models by 2081-2100 reduces
from a very likely range of 6.4-9.5 x 10'2 m2 or 5.5-7.3 x 10'3 m?
under RCP8.5 (as much as 16-20% of ocean surface area for
aragonite), to just 0.01-0.2 x 10’ m? or 0.01-0.13 x 103 m?
under RCP2.6 for either calcite or aragonite minerals, respectively.

"Although ocean acidification results in long-term trends in mean ocean
chemistry, it can also influence seasonal cycles. Observation-based
products indicate that the seasonal cycle of global surface-ocean
pCOz increased in amplitude by 2.2+0.4patm between 1982 and
2014 (Landschiitzer et al. 2018). CMIP5 models and data-based
products similarly project consistent future increases in the seasonal
cycle of surface-ocean pCO2 under the RCP8.5 emissions scenario,
with enhanced amplification in high-latitude waters (McNeil and
Sasse, 2016). The amplitude of the seasonal cycle of global surface-
ocean free acidity ([H*]) is projected to increase by 71-91% (across
90% confidence intervals) over the 21st century under RCP8.5, also
with greater amplification in the high-latitudes (Kwiatkowski and Orr,
2018). Conversely, models project a 12-20% reduction (across 90%
confidence intervals) in the seasonal amplitude of surface-ocean
pH, as changes in pH represent relative changes in [H*] due to their
logarithmic relationship, and there are typically greater projected
increases in annual mean state [H*] than the seasonal amplitude of
[H*]. Models also project a 4-14% (across 90% confidence intervals)
reduction in the seasonal amplitude of global mean surface-ocean
aragonite saturation state under RCP8.5, with a slight amplification
in the subtropics being outweighed by dampening elsewhere.

"Under RCP8.5, hotspots for undersaturated waters for calcite remain
restricted to the Arctic Ocean, while for aragonite, much of the
Southern Ocean and the North Pacific and Northwestern Atlantic
Oceans are also projected to become undersaturated (Orr et al.
2005; Hauri et al. 2015; Sasse et al. 2015). These results arise from
the very well understood reductions in carbonate ion concentrations
at lower pH, the vulnerability of regions with naturally low mean
values, and the greater overall sensitivity of aragonite solubility.
Regional models, with higher resolution that ESMs, also project
year-round corrosive conditions for aragonite in some eastern
boundary upwelling systems (Franco et al. 2018a). In the ocean
interior, the decline in pH and calcium carbonate saturation state is
more uncertain across models (Steiner et al. 2014) as it is modulated
by changes to ocean overturning and water mass subduction
(Resplandy et al. 2013; Chen et al. 2017). Projected benthic changes
in pH over the next century are highly localised and are linked to
transport of surface anomalies to depth, with over 20% of the north
Atlantic sea floor deeper than 500 m projected to experience pH
reductions greater than 0.2 units by 2100 under the RCP8.5 scenario
(Gehlen et al. 2014). Changes in pH in the abyssal ocean (>3000 m
deep) are greatest in the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, with lesser
impact in the Southern and Pacific Oceans by 2100, mainly due to
the circulation timescales (Sweetman et al. 2017).

"Analyses of direct measurements of ocean chemistry from time series
stations and merged shipboard studies show consistent decreases
in surface-ocean pH over the past few decades. Reductions range
between 0.013-0.03 pH units decade“ over records that span up
to 25 years (Table $M5.3). Focusing on the individual time series
locations with records longer than 15 years, there is an overall decline
of 0.017-0.027 (across 99% confidence intervals). Trends calculated
from repeat measurements on ocean surveys show a consistent
value of around —0.02 pH units decade“ for diverse oceanic regions
(Table SM5.3), with greater subsurface than surface trends reported
in the subtropical oceans (Dore et al. 2009). At larger spatial scales,
surface-ocean pH trends are assessed using shipboard observations
of the fugacity of CO2 and estimates of ocean alkalinity (Takahashi
et al. 2014; Lauvset et al. 2015). Between 1991-2011, mean
surface-ocean pH has declined by 0.018 + 0.004 units decade in
70% of ocean biomes, with the largest declines in the Indian Ocean
(-0.027 units decade""), eastern Equatorial Pacific (-0.026 units
decade"") and the South Pacific subtropical (-0.022 units decade“)
biomes (Lauvset et al. 2015). Due to the close link between carbonate
ion concentrations and pH, mean trends in the stability of mineral
forms of aragonite and calcite (known as the ‘saturation state’) that
are important for organisms such as coccolithophorids, pteropods
and corals follow those of pH, with high-latitude regions most
vulnerable to under-saturation due to naturally lower mean values.

"Overall, we assess that alongside the strong mean state changes, it
is very likely that the amplitude of the seasonal cycle in free acidity
will increase by 71-91%, while it is very likely that the seasonal
cycles of pH and aragonite saturation will decrease by 12-20% and
4-14%, respectively.

"The contrasting changes in the seasonal amplitudes of ocean
carbonate chemistry variables derive from different sensitivities to
atmospheric CO2 and climate change and to diverging trends in the
seasonal cycles of DIC, alkalinity and temperature. Model skill at
simulating the seasonal cycles of carbonate chemistry is moderate,
with persistent biases in the Southern Ocean, particularly for pCOz,

"Ocean oxygen changes are also affected by climate variability on
interannual and decadal timescales, especially for the tropical ocean
OMZs (Deutsch et al. 2011). ENSO variability in particular affects the
thermocline structure, which then alongside changes in circulation
modulates oxygen solubility and respiratory demand in this region
(Ito and Deutsch, 2013; Eddebbar et al. 2017). These drivers may then
be combined with modifications to overturning and ventilation of
ONMZs by lateral jets and equatorial current intensity (Duteil et al.
2014). Centennial scale studies based on isotope proxies for low
oxygen regions have demonstrated fluctuations in OMZ extent linked
to decadal changes in tropical trade winds that affects interior ocean
respiratory oxygen demand, which implies that it will be difficult
"	Text
"Regionally, all studies agree that the north Pacific and Southern
Oceans have shown the largest overall oxygen declines (Figure 5.9),
but there is some disagreement regarding the magnitude of the
oxygen change in the tropical ocean, with some studies suggesting
significant declines (Schmidtko et al. 2017) and other reporting
more modest reductions (Helm et al. 2011; Ito et al. 2017) and data
coverage is still limited for some regions and deeper than 1000 m.
Based on the available data, the strongest declines in deep ocean
oxygen have occurred in the Equatorial Pacific, North Pacific,
Southern Ocean and South Atlantic, with intermediate declines in
the Arctic, South Pacific and Equatorial Atlantic, while the north
Atlantic has experienced a moderate oxygen increase below 1200 m
(Figure 5.9). A particular difference between parallel oxygen analyses
concerns the means of integrating and mapping sparse data across
the ocean, both horizontally and vertically, with different studies
making specific decisions about averaging grids and integration
methods. Moreover, data remains sparse for some ocean regions,
depths and periods. Taken together, the challenges of data sparsity,
regional differences and the relatively large uncertainties on the
oxygen changes across different studies, but also recognising that
oxygen declines are significantly different to zero, leads to medium
confidence in the observed oxygen decline.
"	Text
"Ocean oxygen (02) levels at the surface are controlled by the balance
between oxygen production during photosynthesis, temperature-
controlled solubility and air-sea exchange. Deeper in the water
column, consumption of oxygen during respiration and redistribution
by ocean circulation and mixing are dominant processes. In theory,
a warmer more stratified ocean would have a reduced oxygen
content, due to the combined influence of lowered gas solubility
and a greater interior respiration of organic matter due to enhanced
physical isolation of subsurface waters. In accord, global changes in
ocean oxygen assessed from three different analyses of compiled
global oxygen datasets going back to the 1960s agree that there is
a net loss of oxygen from the ocean over all depths (see Table 5.2).
For the 0-1000 m depth stratum that contains the most data and is
common to all three analyses, oxygen is assessed to have declined
by a very likely range of 0.5-3.3% between 1970 and 2010. For the
surface ocean (0-100 m) and the thermocline later of 100-600 m
the very likely range of oxygen declines are 0.2-2.1% and 0.7-3.5%,
respectively (Table 5.2). Across two studies, global oxygen is assessed
to have declined by a very likely range of 0.3-2.0%, with a similar
range of decline for waters deeper than 600 m (Table 5.2). The
regions of lowest oxygen, known as OMZs, with oxygen levels lower
than 80 mmol L), are observed to be expanding by a very likely
range of 3.0-8.3% across the three studies.
"	Text
"The role of ocean warming alone in driving the oxygen changes can
be appraised using solubility estimates, which vary between around
15-50% for the upper 1000 m oxygen trend between studies (Helm
et al. 2011; Ito et al. 2017; Schmidtko et al. 2017). The role of other
processes, linked to changing ocean ventilation and respiration are
challenging to appraise directly, but tend to reinforce the impacts
from warming and are probably predominant overall (Oschlies
et al. 2018). Indeed, that the observed oxygen decline is negatively
correlated with ocean heat content changes (Ito et al. 2017) reflects
the overriding role of changing ocean ventilation and associated
processes (see also Section 5.2.2). That the ratio of the associated
oxygen to heat changes is larger than would be expected from thermal
processes alone also highlights the role played by other processes
(Oschlies et al. 2018). Local oxygen trends have emphasised the role
of changes to ocean physics in western Northern Pacific (Whitney
et al. 2013); Sasano et al. (2015), the southern California Current
region (Goericke et al. 2015), and the Santa Barbara Basin (Goericke
et al. 2015). In regions of high mesoscale activity, such as the tropical
north Atlantic, low oxygen eddies can have a significant impact
on oxygen dynamics (Karstensen et al. 2015; Grundle et al. 2017).
Oxygen fluctuations in the deep ocean have been linked to changes
in large scale ocean circulation (Watanabe et al. 2003; Stendardo
and Gruber, 2012) and at the global scale, the observed oxygen
decline is negatively correlated with ocean heat content changes (Ito
et al. 2017). Changes to respiration rates, either due to temperature
enhancement or in the amount/quality of organic material can also
be important and the enhanced respiratory demand associated with
an intensified monsoon has been invoked as a driver of the expansion
of the Arabian Sea OMZ (Lachkar et al. 2018).

"Future changes in oxygen can be appraised from ESMs that account
for the combined effects of ocean physics and biogeochemistry.
Globally, these models project that it is very likely oxygen will decline
by 3.2-3.7% or 1.6-2.0% (both across 90% confidence limits) for
RCP8.5 or RCP2.6, respectively, relative to 2000 (Bopp et al. 2013).
Focussing on the 100-600 m depth stratum, O2 changes by —4 to
-3.1% for the RCP8.5 or by —0.5-0.1% for the RCP2.6 scenario
(relative to 2006-2015, Figure 5.8d). It should be noted that ESMs
appear to be underestimating the rate of oxygen change from
available datasets from the historical period (Oschlies et al. 2018).
Increased tropical ocean stratification reduces interior ocean oxygen
by diminishing pathways of ventilation in the subtropical gyres
and by inhibiting turbulent mixing with the oxygen-rich surface
ocean (see Section 5.2.2.2.4). This relatively robust global modelled
trend (Figure 5.8d) however masks important uncertainties in the
projection of regional trends (Figure 5.8e), particularly in the tropical
ocean OMZs (Bopp et al. 2013; Cocco et al. 2013; Cabré et al. 2015).
The uncertainty in the trends in tropical ocean OMZs arises due to
the fact that oxygen depletion due to warming induced reductions in
oxygen saturation are opposed by oxygen enrichment due to reduced
oxygen consumption during respiration in response to predicted
declines in marine export production, as well as biases due to model

"Simulations extended to 2300 suggest that by 2150 the trend of
declining tropical ocean oxygen (both in terms of concentrations
and volume of low oxygen waters) may reverse itself, mainly due
to the effect of strong declines in primary production and organic
matter fluxes to the ocean interior (Fu et al. 2018) or due to enhanced
Antarctic ventilation (Yamamoto et al. 2015), but with low confidence
due to limited evidence. At the global scale, 10,000 year intermediate
complexity model simulations find that overall ocean oxygen loss
shows near linear relationships to equilibrium temperature, itself
linearly related to cumulative emissions, and any climate mitigation
scenario will reduce peak oxygen loss by 4.4% per degree Celsius of
avoided warming (Battaglia and Joos, 2018).

"There is limited evidence on contemporary trends in nutrient levels,
either from time series sites or broader meta-analyses. Increasing
inputs of anthropogenic nitrogen from the atmosphere are
perturbing ocean nutrient levels (Jickells et al. 2017). In the North
Pacific in particular, additional atmospheric nitrogen input has raised
the nitrogen to phosphorus ratio between 1988-2011 and induced
a progressive shift towards phosphorus limitation in this region
(Kim et al. 2011; Kim et al. 2014; Ren et al. 2017). This tendency is
supported by modelling experiments that find enhanced atmospheric
nitrogen input only has a small influence on productivity due to
expanded phosphorus limitation (Yang and Gruber, 2016) and other
nitrogen cycle feedbacks (Somes et al. 2016; Landolfi et al. 2017).

"Diverse studies (including shipboard experiments and use of protein
biomarkers) have highlighted nitrogen and phosphorus limitation in
the stratified tropical ocean regions accompanied by widespread iron
limitation at high latitudes and in upwelling regions that typically
have elevated levels of productivity (Figure 5.11) (Moore et al.
2013; Saito et al. 2014; Browning et al. 2017; Tagliabue et al. 2017).
Moreover, more extensive experimental work has demonstrated
overlapping nitrogen-iron co-limitation at the boundaries between
gyre and upwelling regimes (Browning et al. 2017). There is high
confidence arising from robust evidence and high agreement across
different types of studies that the main limiting nutrient is either iron
(in most major upwelling regions and the Southern, north Atlantic
and sub-Arctic Pacific Oceans) or nitrogen and phosphorus (in the
low productivity tropical ocean gyres).

will trap nutrients in the ocean interior and reduce upper ocean
nutrient levels, alongside an additional local impact from changes
to atmospheric delivery. However, no CMIP5 models accounted for
changes in nutrient delivery from dust and anthropogenic aerosols
during their experiments, which could be an important component
of regional change (Wang et al. 2015b; Somes et al. 2016; Yang and
Gruber, 2016). ESMs project a decline in the nitrate content of the
upper 100 m of 9-14% or 1.5-6% (across 90% confidence intervals)

Projected changes to upper 100 m nitrate concentrations are
significantly different to zero for both RCP8.5 and RCP2.6 at the 90%

variability and inter-model variability contribute roughly equally to the
overall projection uncertainty in 2100 (Figure 5.8i) and there is no clear

medium confidence in these projections due to the limited evidence
of past changes that can be robustly understood and reproduced

"Iron concentrations are projected to increase in the future from ESM
simulations, due to enhanced lateral transport into high-latitude
oceans and reduced biological consumption in regions of declining
nitrate (Misumi et al. 2013). Other modelling efforts also suggest
greater levels of the more biologically available Fe(II) species in
a warmer and more acidic ocean (Tagliabue and Volker, 2011). These
modelling studies tend to indicate greater ocean iron availability in
the future overall, but the very limited skill of contemporary global
ocean iron models in reproducing observations available from the
new basin scale datasets from the international GEOTRACES program
and neglect for parallel dust supply changes lower the confidence in
the models’ projected changes (Tagliabue et al. 2016).

the phytoplankton standing stock is modified by both gains from
growth and losses due to grazing by zooplankton (Figure 5.12).
Export production is here defined as the sinking flux of particulate
organic carbon (produced by NPP) across a specified depth horizon.
Otherwise known as the biological pump, export production is also
a key component of the global carbon cycle (see Section 5.2.2.3) and
an essential food supply to benthic organisms (see Section 5.2.3.2).
Export production is regulated by the level of primary production
and the transfer efficiency with depth, itself controlled by the type
of sinking organic carbon, which is affected by the upper ocean food
web structure (Boyd et al. 2019).

ocean colour, often alongside other remotely sensed information,

<+1% yr for individual time periods (Boyce et al. 2014; Gregg and

significant mismatches when compared to in situ data and reducing
uncertainties in derived NPP is a high priority for the community
(Lee et al. 2015), although there is a reasonable correlation in higher
biomass coastal regions (Kahru et al. 2009). Importantly, satellite
records are not yet long enough to unambiguously isolate long term
climate related trends from natural variability (Beaulieu et al. 2013).
Overall, there is low confidence in satellite-based trends in global
ocean NPP due to the time series length and lack of corroborating in
situ measurements or other validation time series. This is especially
true at regional scales where distinct sets of poorly understood

"CMIP5 models show a strong negative relationship between changes
in stratification that reduces net nutrient supply and integrated export
production (Fu et al. 2016). Export production is projected to decline
by 8.9-15.8% or 1.6-4.9% (across 90% confidence intervals) by
2100, relative to 2000 for the RCP8.5 or RCP2.6 scenario, respectively
(Bopp et al. 2013; Fu et al. 2016; Laufkotter et al. 2016). The projected
changes in export production can be larger than global primary
production because they are affected by both the NPP changes,
but also how shifts in food web structure modulates the ‘transfer
efficiency’ of particulate organic material (Guidi et al. 2016; Tréguer
et al. 2018), which then affects the sinking speed and lability of
exported particles through the ocean interior to the sea floor (Bopp
et al. 2013; Fu et al. 2016; Laufkétter et al. 2016). Declines in export
production over much of the ocean mean that the flux arriving at
the sea floor is also predicted to decline, while increases in export
production are projected in the polar regions that see enhanced NPP
(Sweetman et al. 2017).

"Detailed analyses of the interplay between different drivers of
NPP, including temperature, light, nutrient levels and grazing
from a subset of CMIP5 models, reveals a complex interplay with
a strong latitudinal dependence (Laufkétter et al. 2015) summarised
in Figure 5.12. Warming acts to enhance growth, most notably at
lower latitudes, while light conditions are also predicted to improve,
mostly at the poles. Nutrient limitation shows a much more complex
response across models, but tends to increase in the tropics and
northern high latitudes, with little change in the Southern Ocean.
Taken together there is a tendency for reduced growth rates
across the entire ocean, but there is a large amount of inter-model
variability. The changes in growth are allied to a consistent increase
in the grazing loss of biomass to upper trophic levels. Since AR5, we
have an increasing body of literature concerning role of biological
feedbacks, especially due to interactions between organisms, specific
physiological responses and from upper trophic levels on nutrient
concentrations, linked to variable food quality (Kwiatkowski et al.
2018), resource recycling (Boyd et al. 2015a; Tagliabue et al. 2017)

"Future changes in NPP will result from the changing influence from
temperature, light, nutrients and grazing (Figure 5.12). Across CMIP
models, NPP is predicted to broadly decline or remain constant
by 2081-2100, with mean changes by 2100 of -3.8 to -10.6%
and —1.1-0.8% across 90% confidence intervals for the RCP85
and RCP26 scenario, respectively (all relative to 2006-2015), with
a strong degree of regional symmetry (Figure 5.8k). As seen for
nitrate, changes are most marked in low-latitude upwelling regions,
which are projected to show the largest absolute declines. As for
nitrate, projected NPP changes are lower for the RCP26 scenario
(Figure 5.8j), but the overall uncertainty is dominated by internal
and inter-model variability in 2100 (Figure 5.8l) which results in
no clear separation of NPP trends between the RCP85 and RCP26
(Figure 5.8)). Tropical ocean NPP is projected to show a large decline,
but is underpinned by substantial intermodal uncertainty, with mean
changes of 11 + 24% across the suite of CMIP5 models by 2100,
relative to 2000 under RCP8.5 (Laufkétter et al. 2015). However, if
emergent constraints from the historical record that link the variability
of tropical productivity to temperature anomalies then a four-fold
decline in inter-model uncertainty results. This leads to a projected
tropical ocean decline of 11 + 6%, or from 6.8-16.2% across 90%
confidence limits, depending on which historical constraint is used
(Kwiatkowski et al. 2017). NPP is projected to increases for higher
latitude regions, such as the Arctic and Southern Oceans.

"The realism in model projections can be appraised via their ability
to accurately simulate the limiting nutrient in specific ocean
regions (Figure 5.11), with high model skill in reproducing surface
distributions of nitrate and phosphate (Laufkétter et al. 2015),
raising confidence in projections in nitrogen and phosphorus limited
systems, but poor skill in reproducing iron distributions (Tagliabue
et al. 2016) lowering confidence in iron limited regions (Figure 5.11).
In addition to concentrations of specific nutrients, the response of
NPP to environmental change is strongly controlled by accurate
representation of the ratio of resources (Moreno et al. 2017). Overall
CMIP5 models skill in reproducing patterns of NPP and export
production from limited satellite derived estimates range from
poor to average (correlation coefficients of 0.1-0.6 across different
models (Laufk6tter et al. 2016; Moreno et al. 2017)), but it should be
noted that complete comprehensive observational datasets do not
exist for these metrics with very few jin situ observations. As export
production is a much better understood net integral of changing net
nutrient supply (Sarmiento and Gruber, 2002) and can be constrained
by interior ocean nutrient and oxygen levels, there is medium
confidence in these projections for global changes. Improving the
ability of models to reproduce historical NPP is crucial for more
accurate projections as model biases in simulating contemporary
ocean biogeochemistry play a key role in driving future projections

"	Title
"It must be noted that variability will be greater in the coastal ocean than for the open ocean, which will be important for both hazard
exposure for coastal species and the detection of trends. For example, although signals of anthropogenic influences have already
emerged from internal variability in the late 20th century for global and basin-scale averaged ocean surface and sub-surface temperature
(very likely) (AR5 WGI Summary for Policymakers), their ToE and level of confidence vary greatly at local scales and in coastal seas
(Frélicher et al. 2016). Pelagic organisms with small range size may thus be more (or less) at risk to warming with earlier (or later)
ToE at the scale of the area that they inhabit. From an observational standpoint, analyses that account for autocorrelation of noise
suggest time series of around a decade are sufficient to detect a trend in pH or SST, whereas datasets spanning 30 years or longer are
typically needed for detection of emergence at local scales for oxygen, nitrate and primary productivity (Henson et al. 2016).
"	Text
"This assessment considers the ToE of hazards exposed to by marine organisms and ecosystems. These biological components of the
ocean respond to climate hazards that emerge locally, rather than to the global and basin-scale averages reported in WGI AR5 (Stocker
et al. 2013). Overall, ESMs show that there is an ordered emergence of the climate variables, with pH emerging rapidly across the
entire open ocean, followed by sea surface temperature (SST), interior oxygen, upper ocean nutrient levels and finally NPP under
both Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)2.6 and RCP8.5 relative to the 1861-1900 reference period (Box 5.1, Figure 1).
Anthropogenic signals remain detectable for over large parts of the ocean even for the RCP2.6 scenario for pH and SST, but are likely
lowered for nutrients and NPP in the 21st century. For example, for the open ocean, the anthropogenic pH signal in Earth System
Models (ESM) historical simulations is very likely to have emerged for three-quarters of the ocean prior to 1950 and it is very likely
over 95% of the ocean has already been affected, with little discernable difference between scenarios. The climate signal of oxygen
loss will very likely emerge from the historical climate by 2050 with a very likely range of 59-80% by 2031-2050 and rising with a
very likely range of 79-91% of the ocean area by 2081-2100 (RCP8.5 emissions scenario). The emergence of oxygen loss is smaller
in area under RCP2.6 scenario in the 21st century and by 2090 the emerged area is declining (Henson et al. 2017) (Box 5.1 Figure 1). It
has also been shown that changes to oxygen solubility or utilisation may emerge earlier than bulk oxygen levels (Hameau et al. 2019).

"The rapidity of change and its geographic scope, encompassed in the ToE, can be linked to concepts of exposure to hazard and
vulnerability of biota. As organisms have evolved to be adaptable to natural variations in the environmental conditions of their
habitats, changes to their habitat conditions larger than that typically experienced or specific biological thresholds such as upper
temperature or oxygen tolerance may become hazardous (Mora et al. 2013). This would then move from the statistical nature of
the ‘detection and attribution’ nature of the ToE discussed above towards timescales of impacts on organisms useful for ecosystem
projections. In doing so, it will be important to think about the differences in habitat suitability between different organisms, including
their specific thresholds for specific drivers, for example, temperature, oxygen or calcium carbonate stability. Further, thresholds vary
depending on habitat, for example, warming thresholds for coral bleaching (Pendleton et al. 2016) may differ from the temperature
and oxygen thresholds for fishes such as Atlantic cod and tunas (Deutsch et al. 2015). Moreover, species with fast generation
times relative to the ToE of key habitat conditions (e.g., phytoplankton) may evolve more quickly to environmental change and be less
vulnerable to climate change than longer-lived, slower generation time species (e.g., large sharks) (Jones and Cheung, 2018). However,
evidence on evolutionary adaptation to expected climate change is limited, thus while shorter generation time may facilitate adaptation
to environmental change, it does not necessarily result in successful adaptation of organisms (Section 5.2.3.1).
"	Text
"The concept of time of emergence (ToE) is defined as the time at which the signal of climate change in a given variable emerges
from a measure of the background variability or noise (SROCC Glossary). In associating a calendar date with the detection, attribution
and projection of climate trends, the concept of a ToE has proved useful for policy and planning particularly through informing
important climatic thresholds and the uncertainties associated with past and future climate change (Hawkins and Sutton, 2012).
However, there is not a single agreed metric and the ToE for a given variable thus depends on choices regarding the space and time
scale, the threshold at which emergence is defined and the reference period (IPCC 5th Asseessment Report (AR5) Working Group
| (WGI) Section 11.3.2.1). Recently, the ToE concept has been expanded to consider variables related to climatic hazards to marine
organisms and ecosystems such as pH, carbonate ion concentrations, aragonite and calcite saturation states, nutrient levels and
marine primary productivity (Box 5.1, Figure 1) (Ilyina et al. 2009; Friedrich et al. 2012; Keller et al. 2014b; Lovenduski et al. 2015;
Rodgers et al. 2015). ToE assessments for the ocean typically quantify the internal variability using the standard deviation of the
detrended data over a given time period (Keller et al. 2014b; Rodgers et al. 2015; Henson et al. 2016; Henson et al. 2017), the scenario
and model uncertainty associated with different climate scenarios and across available ESMs (Frolicher et al. 2016), and in some cases
the autocorrelation of noise (Weatherhead et al. 1998). As more components of ‘noise’ are accounted for, the ToE lengthens and the
ToE is also affected by whether a control simulation or historical variability is used to determine the noise (Hameau et al. 2019).

"Marine pelagic ecosystems (the water column extending from the
surface ocean down to the deep sea floor) face increasing climate
related hazards from the changing environmental conditions (see
Section 5.2.2). WGII ARS (Pértner et al. 2014) concluded, as also
confirmed in Section 5.2.2, that long time series of more than
three or four decades in length are necessary for determining
biological trends in the ocean. However, long-term biological
observations of pelagic ecosystems are rare and biased toward
mid to high-latitude systems in the Northern Hemisphere (Edwards

This assessment, therefore, combines multiple lines of evidence
ranging from experiments, field observations to model simulations
to detect and attribute drivers of biological changes in the past,
project future climate impacts and risks of pelagic ecosystems. In
this section the pelagic ecosystem is subdivided into the surface,
epipelagic ocean (<200 m, the uppermost part of the ocean that

and the deep pelagic ocean, comprising the twilight, mesopelagic

the deep sea as below 1000 m (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2014), the
absence of photosynthetically useful light and ensuing critical
ecological, biogeochemical transformations, and altered human

responded positively to climate change as they have been able
to take advantage of the increased intensity of winds. This has
allowed them to forage farther and faster, making their foraging
trips shorter, increasing their foraging efficiency and breeding
success (Descamps et al. 2015; Thorne et al. 2016). For reptiles,

suggesting that there is a longer time-of-emergence of range

in community composition (high confidence). There is general
under-representation of biogeographical records in low latitudes

variation in responses of marine biota to range shifts can cause

than those records for organisms in the seafloor; the latter has an
average rate of distribution shift of 29.0 + 15.5 km per decade
(44% of the records for seafloor species with range shifts that
are consistent with expectation from the observed temperature
changes) (very likely) (Figure 5.13). Comparison of global seafloor-
derived planktonic foraminifera from pre-industrial age with recent
(from year 1978) communities show that the recent assemblages
differ from their pre-industrial with increasing dominance of warmer
or cooler species that are mostly consistent with temperature
changes (Jonkers et al. 2019). Rate of observed responses also varies
between and within animal groups among ocean regions, with
zooplankton and fishes having faster recorded range shifts (Pinsky
et al. 2013; Asch, 2015; Jones and Cheung, 2015; Poloczanska et al.
2016). For example, analysis of the Continuous Plankton Recorder
(CPR) data-series from the north Atlantic in the last decades shows
that the range of dinoflagellates tended to closely track the velocity
of climate change (the rate of isotherm movement). In contrast, the
distribution range of diatoms shifted much more slowly (Chivers
et al. 2017) and its distribution seems to be primary influenced
by multi-decadal variability rather than from secular temperature
trends. The CPR surveys have also provided evidence that some
calanoid copepods are expanding poleward in the Northeast
Atlantic, at a rate up to 232 km per decade (Beaugrand, 2009;
Chivers et al. 2017), although different calanoid species respond
differently in the rate and direction of shifts (Philippart et al. 2003;
Edwards and Richardson, 2004; Asch, 2015; Crespo et al. 2017).
Overall, the observed changes in biogeography are consistent
with expected responses to changes in ocean temperature for the
majority of marine biota (high confidence). This is also consistent
with theories and experimental evidence that scale from individual
organisms’ physiological responses to community level effects (high
confidence). Sensitivity of organisms’ biogeography varies between
taxonomic groups (high confidence).

average NPP and biomass of phytoplankton community will decrease
in the 21st century under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 (see Section 5.2.2.6).
However, the future risk of impacts of epipelagic ecosystem can
also depend on changes in community structure of phytoplankton
species. Barton et al. (2016) projected the biogeography of 87 taxa
of phytoplankton (diatoms and dinoflagellates) in the north Atlantic
to 2051-2100 relative to the past (1951-2000) with scenarios of
changes in temperature and other ocean conditions such as salinity,
density and nutrients under RCP8.5. The study found that 74% of the
studied taxa exhibit a poleward shift at a median rate of 12.9 km
per decade, but 90% of the taxa shift eastward at a median rate
of 42.7 km per decade. Such changes may affect food webs and
biogeochemical cycles, and with consequence to the productivity of
living marine resources (Stock et al. 2014; Barton et al. 2016).

"supports that ocean acidification and hypoxia can act additively or
synergistically between each other and with temperature across
different groups of biota (Figure 5.13). Limitation of nutrient and
food availability and predation pressures can further increase
the sensitivity of organismal groups to climate change in specific
ecosystems (Riebesell et al. 2017). Climate change also affects
organisms indirectly through the impacts on competitiveness
between organisms that favour those that are more adaptive to
the changing environmental conditions (Alguero-Muniz et al. 2017)
and changes in trophic interactions (Seebacher et al. 2014). Overall,
direct in situ observations and laboratory experiments show that
there are significant responses to the multiple stressors of warming,
ocean acidification and low oxygen on phytoplankton, zooplankton
and fishes and that these responses can be additive or synergistic

"WGIl ARS and SR15 conclude that projected ocean warming will
continue to cause poleward shifts in the distribution and biomass
of pelagic species, paralleled by altered seasonal timing of their
activities, species abundance, migration pattern and reduction
in body size in the 21st century under scenarios of increasing
greenhouse gas emission (Portner et al. 2014; Hoegh-Guldberg
et al. 2018). Simultaneously, projected expansion of OMZ and ocean
acidification could lead to shifts in community composition toward
hypoxia-tolerant and non-calcified organisms, respectively. However,
these projected biological changes in the ocean raise questions
about how individuals, communities and food webs will respond to
the multiple impacts from climatic and non-climatic stressors in the
future, and the feedbacks of the effects of their ecological impacts
on modifying the physical and biogeochemical conditions of the
ocean (Schaum et al. 2013; Boyd et al. 2016; O’Brien et al. 2016;
Moore, 2018). This section focuses on addressing these questions in
order to assess the future risk of impacts of climate change on the
epipelagic ecosystem.

"Warming has contributed also to observed changes in phenology
(timing of repeated seasonal activities) of marine organisms
(Gittings et al. 2018), although observations are biased towards the
northeast Atlantic (Poloczanska et al. 2016; Thackeray et al. 2016).
Shifts in the timing of interacting species have occurred in the
last decades, eventually leading to uncoupling between prey and
predators, with cascading community and ecosystem consequences
(Kharouba et al. 2018; Neuheimer et al. 2018). Timing of spring
phenology of marine organisms is shifting to earlier in the year
under warming, at an average rate of 4.4 + 1.1 days per decade
(Poloczanska et al. 2013), although it is variable among taxonomic
groups and among ocean regions (Lindley and Kirby, 2010). This is
consistent with the expectations based on the close relationship
between temperature and these biological events, supporting
evidence from ARS (Bruge et al. 2016; Poloczanska et al. 2016). Thus,
the growing amount of literature and new studies since AR5 WGIl
and SR15 further support that phenology of marine ectotherms
in the epipelagic systems are related to ocean warming (high
confidence) and that the timing of biological events has shifted
earlier (high confidence).

"WGIl ARS concludes that multiple climatic hazards from ocean
acidification, hypoxia and decrease in nutrient and food supplies
pose risks to marine ecosystems, and the risk can be elevated when
combined with warming (Riebesell and Gattuso, 2014; Gattuso et al.
2015). In a recent meta-analysis of 632 published experiments,
primary production by temperate non-calcifying plankton increases
with elevated temperature and CO2, whereas tropical plankton
decreases productivity because of acidification (Nagelkerken and
Connell, 2015). Also, temperature increases consumption and
metabolic rates of herbivores but not secondary production; the
latter decreases with acidification in calcifying and non-calcifying
species. These effects together create a mismatch with carnivores
whose metabolic and foraging costs increase with temperature
(Nagelkerken and Connell, 2015). Warming may also exacerbate
the effects of ocean acidification on the rate of photosynthesis in
phytoplankton (Lefevre, 2016). There is some, but limited, reports of
observed impacts on calcified pelagic organisms that are attributed
to secular trend in ocean acidification and warming (Harvey et al.
2013; Kroeker et al. 2013; Nagelkerken et al. 2015; Boyd et al. 2016).
For example, Rivero-Calle et al. (2015) reported, using CPR archives,
that stocks of coccolithophores (a group of phytoplankton that forms
calcium carbonate plateles) have increased by 2% to over 20% in
the north Atlantic over the last five decades, and that this increase
is linked to synergistic effects of increasing anthropogenic CO2 and
rising temperatures, as supported by their statistical analysis and

"Regional differences in the changes in phytoplankton community
and their impacts on epipelagic ecosystem are however complex
and depends on multiple interactions of co-varying climate change
stressors at regional level (Boyd and Hutchins, 2012). Based on
global ocean model simulations, Boyd et al. (2015b) show that
the interaction between warming, increased CO? and a decline in
phosphate and silicate would benefit coccolithophores against
diatoms in the northern north Atlantic, despite decreasing rates
of calcification. Evidence, based on long-term experiments of
acclimation or adaptation to increasing temperatures in combination
with elevated CO2, show that individual growth and carbon fixation
rates of coccolithophores at high CO2 are modulated by temperature,
light, nutrients and UV radiation, and could increase calcification
while the responses are also species-specific (Lohbeck et al. 2012;
Khanna et al. 2013). Calcification of planktonic foraminifera will be
however negatively affected by acidification (Roy et al. 2015), and
their populations are predicted to experience the greatest decrease
in diversity and abundance in sub-polar and tropical areas, under
RCP8.5 (Brussaard et al. 2013), however environmental controls of
calcite production by foraminifera are still poorly understood (low

"Outputs from CMIP5 ESMs suggest that projected warming and
reduction in nutrient availability in low latitudes, as a result of
increasing stratification of the ocean under climate change, will
increase the dominance of small-sized phytoplankton, growing
more efficiently than larger taxa at low nutrient levels (Dutkiewicz
et al. 2013b). Dominant groups in subtropical oceans, like the
picoplanktonic cyanobacteria Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus,
are projected to expand their range of distribution towards higher
latitudes and increase their abundances by 14-29%, respectively,
under a future warmer ocean (Flombaum et al. 2013), although
synergistic effects of warming and CO2 on photosynthetic rates
could lead to a dominance of Synechococcus over Prochlorococcus
(Fu et al. 2007) (low confidence). Similarly, temperature-driven range
shifts towards higher latitudes are also likely for tropical diazotrophic
(Nz-fixing) cyanobacteria, although they could disappear from parts
of their current tropical ranges where future warming may exceed
their maximum thermal tolerance limits (Hutchins and Fu, 2017)
(low confidence). Modelling experiments show that the effects of
warming on phytoplankton community will be exacerbated by ocean
acidification at levels expected in the 21st century for RCP8.5, leading
to increasing growth rate responses of some phytoplankton groups,
such as diazotrophs and Synechococcus, with predicted increases in
biomass up to 10% in tropical and subtropical waters (Dutkiewicz
et al. 2015) (low confidence). Furthermore, warming is projected to
interact with decreasing oxygen levels and increases in iron in the
nutrient-impoverished subtropical waters, favoring the dominance of
the diazotrophic colonial cyanobacteria Trichodesmium (Sohm et al.

"An ensemble of 12 CMIPS ESMs project average declines of
6.4 + 0.79% (95% confident limits) and 13.6 + 1.70%) in
zooplankton biomass in the 21st century relative to 1990-1999
historical values under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 (Kwiatkowski et al.
2019). Also, production of mesozooplankton is projected from
a single ESM to decrease by 7.9% between 1951-2000 and 2051-
2100 under RCP8.5 (Stock et al. 2014). Such projected decreases
in zooplankton biomass and production are partly contributed
by climate-induced reduction in phytoplankton production and
trophic transfer efficiency particularly in low-latitude ecosystems
(Stock et al. 2014) (5.2.2.6). The impacts may be larger than these
projections if changes in the relative abundance of carbon, nitrogen
and phosphorus are considered by the models (Kwiatkowski et al.
2019). The overall projected decrease in zooplankton biomass is
characterised by a strong latitudinal differences, with the largest
decrease in tropical regions and increase in the polar regions,
particularly the Arctic Ocean (Chust et al. 2014; Stock et al. 2014;
Kwiatkowski et al. 2019) (Chapter 3) (high agreement). However,
the projected increase in zooplankton biomass in the polar
region may be affected by the seasonality of light cycle at high
latitudes that may limit the bloom season at high latitude (Sundby
et al. 2016). The projected decrease in zooplankton abundance,
particularly in tropical regions, can impact marine organisms higher
in the foodweb, including fish populations that are important to
fisheries (Woodworth-Jefcoats et al. 2017). Therefore, there is high
agreement in model projections that global zooplankton biomass
will very likely reduce in the 21st century, with projected decline
under RCP8.5 almost doubled that of RCP2.6 (very likely). However,
the strong dependence of the projected declines on phytoplankton
production (low confidence, 5.2.2.6) and simplification in
representation of the zooplankton communities and foodweb
render their projections having low confidence.

"Recent model projections since AR5 and SR15 continue to support
global-scale range shifts of marine fishes at rates of tens to

being substantially higher under RCP8.5 than RCP2.6 (Jones and
Cheung, 2015; Robinson et al. 2015; Morley et al. 2018). Globally,
the general direction of range shifts of epipelagic fishes is poleward
(Jones and Cheung, 2015; Robinson et al. 2015), while the projected
directions of regional and local range shifts generally follow
temperature gradients (Morley et al. 2018). Polewards range shifts
are projected to result in decreases in species richness in tropical
oceans, and increases in mid to high-latitude regions leading to
global-scale species turnover (sum of species local extinction and
expansion) (Ben Rais Lasram et al. 2010; Jones and Cheung, 2015;
Cheung and Pauly, 2016; Molinos et al. 2016) (medium confidence
on trends, low confidence on magnitude because of model
uncertainties and limited number of published model simulations).
For example, species turnover relative to their present day richness

contrast, high-latitude regions (>60°N-60°S) is projected to have

turnover in the Arctic is explained by species’ range expansion from

4.9% by 2031-2050 across all RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 (very likely)
(Figure 5.14). Accounting for the removal of biomass by fishing
exacerbates the decrease in biomass for large-bodied animals
which are particularly sensitive to fishing (likely for the direction
of changes). Regionally, total animal biomass decreases largely in
tropical and mid-latitude oceans (very likely) (Table 5.3, Figure 5.14)
(Bryndum-Buchholz et al. 2019). The high uncertainty and the /ow
confidence in the projection in the Arctic Ocean (Chapter 3) is
because of the large variations in simulation results for this region
between the ESMs and between the FISHMIP models, as well as
the insufficient understanding of the oceanographic changes and
their biological implications in the Arctic Ocean. In the Southern
Ocean, the decrease in consumer biomass is mainly in the southern
Indian Ocean while other parts of the Southern Ocean are projected
to have an increase in animal biomass by 2100 under RCP8.5,
reflecting mainly the projected pattern of changes in NPP from the
ESMs (see Section 5.2.2.6).

"A wide range of studies, from laboratory experiments, mesocosm
enclosures, synthesis of observations to modeling experiments,
provide insights into how the multi-faceted components of the
‘biological pump’ (the physical and biologically mediated processes
responsible for transporting organic carbon from the upper ocean
to depth) are projected to be altered in the coming decades.
A synthesis of the individual components reported to both influence
the performance of the biological pump, and which are sensitive
to changing ocean conditions, is presented in Table 5.4. The table
lists the putative controlling of each environmental factor, such as
warming, that influences the biological pump, and the reported
modification (where available) of each individual factor by changing
ocean conditions for both the epipelagic ocean and the deep
ocean. Analyses of long-term trends in primary production and
particle export production, as well as model simulations, reveal that
increasing temperatures, leading to enhanced stratification and
nutrient limitation, will have the greatest influence on decreasing the
flux of particulate organic carbon (POC) to the deep ocean (Bopp
et al. 2013; Boyd et al. 2015a; Fu et al. 2016; Laufkétter et al. 2016).
However, different lines of evidence (including observation, modeling
and experimental studies) provide low confidence on the mechanistic
understanding of how climatic drivers affect different components of
the biological pump in the epipelagic ocean, as well as changes in
the efficiency and magnitude of carbon export in the deep ocean (see
section below and Table 5.4); this renders the projection of future
contribution of the biological carbon pump to the export of POC to
the deep ocean having /ow confidence.

"Most deep seafloor ecosystems globally are experiencing rising
temperatures, declining oxygen levels, and elevated COz, leading
to lower pH and carbonate undersaturation (WGII ARS 30.5.7;
Section 5.2.2.3). Small changes in exposure to these hazards by deep
seafloor ecosystem have been confirmed by observation over the
past 50 years. However, analysis using direct seafloor observations
of these hazards over the past 15-29 years suggest that the
environmental conditions are highly variable over time because of
the strong and variable influences by ocean conditions from the
sea surface (Frigstad et al. 2015; Thomsen et al. 2017). Such high
environmental variability makes it difficult to attribute observed
trends to anthropogenic drivers using existing datasets (Smith et al.
2013; Hartman et al. 2015; Soltwedel et al. 2016; Thomsen et al.
2017) (high confidence). Projections from global ESMs suggest large
changes for temperature by 2100 and beyond under RCP8.5 (relative
to present day variation) (Mora et al. 2013; Sweetman et al. 2017;
FAO, 2019). The magnitude of the projected changes is lower under
RCP2.6, and in some cases the direction of projected change to 2100
varies regionally under either scenario (FAO, 2019) (high confidence).

"Abyssal communities (3000-6000 m) cover over 50% of the ocean's
surface and are considered to be extremely food limited (Gage and
Tyler, 1992; Smith et al. 2018). There is a strong positive relationship
between surface primary production, export flux, and organic matter
supply to the abyssal seafloor (Smith et al. 2008), with pulses of
surface production reflected as carbon input on the deep seafloor in
days to months (Thomsen et al. 2017). Both vertical and horizontal
transport contribute organic matter to the sea floor (Frischknecht
et al. 2018). Food supply to the seafloor regulates faunal biomass,
explaining the strong positive relationships documented between
surface production and seafloor faunal biomass in the Pacific Ocean
(Smith et al. 2013), Gulf of Mexico (Wei et al. 2011) and north Atlantic
Ocean (Hartman et al. 2015). Extended time series and broad spatial
coverage reveal strong positive relationship between annual POC
flux and abyssal sediment community oxygen consumption (Rowe
et al. 2008; Smith et al. 2016a). Observed reduction in in POC flux
at the abyssal seafloor enhances the relative importance of the
microbial loop and reduces the importance of benthic invertebrates in
carbon transfer (Dunlop et al. 2016) (single study, limited evidence).
However, changes in the overlying mesopelagic and bathypelagic
communities (see Section 5.2.3.2) will also affect food flux to the
deep seafloor, as nekton and zooplankton transfer energy to depth
through diel (daily day-night) vertical migrations, ontogenetic (life
staged-based) migrations and falls of dead carcasses (Gage, 2003).
"	Text
"‘the global magnitude of the biological pump and how this will be
affected by climate change is also uncertain. Model-based studies
agree in projecting a global decline in particle gravitational flux
to the deep sea floor, but with regional variability in both the
total particle export flux and transfer efficiency (DeVries and
Weber, 2017; Sweetman et al. 2017) (see Sections 5.2.2 and
5.2.4). However, recent evidence suggest that other physical
and biological processes may contribute nearly as much as the
gravitational flux to the carbon transport from the surface to the
deep ocean (Boyd et al. 2019), with low confidence on the future
rate of change in magnitude and direction of these processes.
In particular, the ‘active flux’ of organic carbon due to vertical
migration of zooplankton and fishes has been reported to account
from 10 to 40% of the gravitational sinking flux (Bianchi et al.
2013; Davison et al. 2013; Hudson et al. 2014; Jonasdottir et al.
2015; Aumont et al. 2018; Gorgues et al. 2019). Predictions based
on model studies suggest that mesopelagic zooplankton and fish
communities living at deep scattering layers (DSLs) will increase
their biomass by 2100, enhancing their trophic efficiency, because
of deep-ocean warming (Section 5.2.2.1; Figures 5.2 and 5.3) and
shallowing of DSL (Proud et al. 2017) (low confidence). Expansion
of OMZs (see Section 5.2.2.4) will also widen the DSL and increase
the exposure of mesopelagic organisms to shallower depths (Gilly
et al. 2013; Netburn and Anthony Koslow, 2015). In the California
Current, the abundance of mesopelagic fishes is closely tied to
variations in the OMZ, whose dynamic is linked to the Pacific
Decadal Oscillation and ENSO cycles (Koslow et al. 2015). Some
large predators, like the Humboldt squid, could indirectly benefit
from expanding OMZs due to the aggregation of their primary
food source, myctophid fishes (Stewart et al. 2014). However, many
non-adapted fish and invertebrates (like diurnal vertical migrators)
will have their depth distributions compressed, affecting the carbon
transport and trophic efficiency of food webs in the mesopelagic
(Stramma et al. 2011; Brown and Thatje, 2014; Rogers, 2015)
(low confidence). In OMZ waters, where zooplankton is almost
absent, like in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific, the microbial
remineralisation efficiency of sinking particles would be reduced,
eventually increasing the transfer efficiency of organic matter to
the deep ocean and thus biological carbon storage (Cavan et al.
2017) (low confidence; Table 1). However, increases in ocean
temperature may also lead to shallower remineralisation of POC
in warm tropical regions, counteracting the storage of carbon in
the dark ocean (Marsay et al. 2015). Overall, the direct impacts of
climate change on the biological pump are not well understood for
the deep pelagic organisms and ecosystems (Pdrtner et al. 2014),
and there is low confidence on the effect of climate change drivers
on biological processes in the deep ocean (Table 5.1).

"The globally integrated export flux of carbon is projected to decrease
in the open ocean in the 21st century under RCP2.6 (by 1.6-4.9%)
and RCP8.5 (by 8.9-15.8%) relative to 2000 (medium confidence)
(Section 5.2.2.6). This change in export flux of carbon is projected
to yield declines in POC flux at the abyssal seafloor (representing
food supply to benthos) of up to -27% in the Atlantic and up to
—31 to -40% in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, with some increases
in polar regions (Sweetman et al. 2017). In some models, additional
dissolution of calcium carbonate due to ocean acidification further
lowers POC flux, causing the projected export production declines to
be up to 38% at the northeast Atlantic seafloor (Jones et al. 2014).
Lower POC fluxes to the abyss reduce food supply and have been
projected to cause a size-shift towards smaller organisms (Jones et al.
2014), resulting in rising respiration rates, lower biomass production
efficiency, and lesser energy transfer to higher trophic levels (Brown
et al. 2004) (medium confidence). Changes are projected to be
largest for macrofauna and lesser and similar for megafauna and
meiofauna (Jones et al. 2014) (limited evidence, low confidence).

"Therefore, climate change impacts on organic carbon export
from the epipelagic (Section 5.2.3.1) and deeper pelagic systems
(Section 5.2.3.2) can affect the energy available to support the
abyssal seafloor ecosystems (medium confidence). However, because
observations on historical changes in POC flux in abyssal seafloor
ecosystems are limited to a few locations, long-term records show
high variability, and mechanistic understanding of factors affecting
the biological carbon pump is incomplete, there is limited evidence
that the abyssal seafloor ecosystem has already been affected by
changes in POC flux as a result of climate change. The metabolic
rate of deep seafloor ectotherms, and consequently their demand for
food, increases with temperature. Thus, observed warming in deep
sea ecosystems (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2014) (Section 5.2.2.2.1)
is expected to increase the sensitivity of deep seafloor biota to
decrease in food supplies associated with a change in POC flux
(high confidence). However, there is limited evidence of observed
changes in abyssal biota. Small deep sea biota demonstrate
increased efficiency (effective use of food energy for growth and
metabolism with minimal loss) at low food inputs (due to small size
and dominance by prokaryotic taxa) (Gambi et al. 2017). Adaptation
to low food availability in abyssal ecosystems may confer higher
capacity to adjust to reduced food availability than for shallow biota

"Projections using outputs from seven CMIP5 models suggest that
97.8 + 0.6% (95% Cl) of the abyssal seafloor area will experience
a biomass decline by 2091-2100 relative to 2006-2015 under
RCP8.5. The projected decreases in overall POC flux to the abyssal
seafloor are projected to cause a 5.2-17.6% reduction in seafloor
biomass in 2090-2100, relative to 2006-2015 under RCP8.5 (Jones

significantly larger under RCP8.5 than RCP4.5 (Jones et al. 2014).
However, existing estimates are based on total POC flux changes
and do not account for changes in the type or quality of the sinking
material, to which macrofaunal and meiofaunal invertebrates are
highly sensitive (Smith et al. 2008; Smith et al. 2009; Tittensor et al.
2011). The projections also do not account for direct faunal responses
to changes in temperature, oxygen or the carbonate system, all of
which will influence benthic responses to changing food availability
(AR5 Chapter 30.5.7), reducing to medium confidence the risk
assessment that is based on these projections (Figure 5.16).
"	Text
"Regionally, while reductions in POC flux are projected at low and
mid latitudes in the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Oceans, increases are
projected at high latitudes associated in part with reduction in sea ice
cover (Yool et al. 2013; Rogers, 2015; Sweetman et al. 2017; Yool et al.
2017; FAO 2019) (see Chapter 3) (medium confidence). Notably, Arctic
and Southern Ocean POC fluxes at the abyssal seafloor are projected
to increase by up to 38% and 21%, respectively by 2100 under
RCP8.5 (Sweetman et al. 2017). While an increase in food supply may
yield higher benthic biomass at high latitudes, warmer temperatures
and reduced pH projected for the polar regions (Chapter 3) would
elevate faunal metabolic demands, likely diminishing the benefit of
elevated food supply to an unknown extent (Sweetman et al. 2017).
Overall, given the limited food availability for fauna in the abyssal
plains and the projected warming (Section 5.2.2.2.2) that increases
the demand for food to support the elevated metabolic rates, the
projected decrease in influx of organic matter and seafloor biomass
will result in high risks of impacts to abyssal ecosystems by the end
of the 21st century under RCP8.5 (medium confidence) (Figure 5.16).
The risk of impacts is projected to be substantially lower under
RCP4.5 or RCP2.6 (high confidence). The impacts on abyssal seafloor
ecosystems affect functions that are important to support ecosystem
services (see Section 5.4.1). For example, smaller-sized organisms
exhibit reduced bioturbation intensity and depth of mixing causing
reduced carbon sequestration (Smith et al. 2008) (Figure 5.15).

"In some regions, observational records document changing
conditions in bathyal ecosystems (Levin, 2018; Section 5.2.2.4). In the
Northeast Pacific continental slopes associated with the California
Current ecosystem, observations over the past 25 years show high
variability but an overall trend of decreasing ocean oxygen and
pH levels with oxygen declines of up to 40% and pH declines of
0.08 units in California. (Goericke et al. 2015) (high agreement,
robust evidence, high confidence). Large oxygen declines are linked
to past warming events on continental margins, over multiple time
scales from 1-100 ky (Dickson et al. 2012; Moffitt et al. 2015). Studies
across modern oxygen gradients on slopes reveal that suboxic
(5-10 pMol kg~! 02) values lead to loss of biodiversity of fish (Gallo
and Levin, 2016), invertebrates (Levin, 2003; Gallo and Levin, 2016;
Sperling et al. 2016), and protozoans (Bernhard and Reimers, 1991;
Gooday et al. 2000; Moffitt et al. 2014) (high confidence). Shoaling
oxyclines on continental slopes have altered depth distributions
of multiple co-occurring echinoid species over the past 25 years
(Sato et al. 2017) and can reduce the growth rate, and change the
skeletal structure and biochemical composition of a common sea
urchin (Sato et al. 2018). In central Pacific oceanic canyons, fish
abundance and diversity are reduced at 4 to 5 times higher oxygen
concentrations than on continental slopes (<31 Mol kg"" O2)
(De Leo et al. 2012). Low oxygen on continental slopes causes
reductions in faunal body size and bioturbation (Diaz and Rosenberg,
1995; Levin, 2003; Middelburg and Levin, 2009; Sturdivant et al.
2012), simplification of trophic structure reducing energy flow to
upper trophic levels (Sperling et al. 2013), shifts in carbon processing
pathways from metazoans to protozoans (Woulds et al. 2009), and
reduced colonisation potential (Levin et al. 2013). These changes
are expected to lead to altered ecosystem structure and function,
with lower carbon burial (Smith et al. 2000; Levin and Dayton, 2009)

sources fueled by fluids from the earth's interior, hydrothermal
vent and methane seep ecosystems are linked to surface ocean

reliance of vent and seep mussels on surface-derived photosynthetic
production to supplement chemosynthetic food sources (Riou et al.

vulnerable to changing amounts or timing of POC flux to the deep
seabed in most areas except high latitudes, or to changes in timing
of surface production (see Section 5.2.2.5) (limited evidence) Most
of the large, habitat-forming (foundation) species at vents and seeps

potential to alter patterns of larval transport and population
connectivity through changes in circulation (Fox et al. 2016) or surface

"Scleractinian corals have the capacity to acclimate to high CO2 conditions due to their capacity to upregulate the pH at the calcification
site (Form and Riebesell, 2011; Rodolfo-Metalpa et al. 2015; Gori et al. 2016). The most widely distributed, habitat-forming species in
deep water (e.g., Lophelia pertusa [renamed Desmophyllum pertusum) (Addamo et al. 2016) can continue to calcify at aragonite
undersaturation and high CO; levels projected for 2100 (750-1100 uatm) based on experiments (Georgian et al. 2016; Kurman

et al. 2014; Baco et al. 2017) (Appendix 1) (robust evidence, medium agreement, medium confidence) and thus appear to be able to
acclimate to rising CO levels (Hennige et al. 2015). However, net calcification rates (difference between calcification and dissolution)
of L. pertusa exposed to aragonite-undersaturated conditions (Qarag < 1, where Qarag = aragonite saturation state) often decreases
to close to zero or even becomes negative (Lunden et al. 2014; Hennige et al. 2015; Biischer et al. 2017), with genetic variability
underpinning ability to calcify at low aragonite saturation states (Kurman et al. 2017). Additionally, skeletons become longer, thinner
and weaker (Hennige et al. 2015), and bioerosion is enhanced (e.g., by bacteria, fungi, annelids and sponges) (Schonberg et al. 2017),
exacerbating effects of dissolution of the skeleton. L. pertusa can calcify when exposed to multiple environmental stresses in the
laboratory (Hennige et al. 2015; Biischer et al. 2017), but cannot survive with warming above water temperatures of 14°C—-15°C or

(Guinotte et al. 2006) and that no adaptation has been detected with regard to increased dissolution of exposed aragonite (Eyre et al.

warming, deoxygenation, aragonite under-saturation and decrease in POC flux are projected to negatively affect cold water corals

to cope with these changes and in the influence of altered regional current patterns on connectivity (Fox et al. 2016; Roberts et al.

"Generally, the deep sea areas where cold water corals may be found are projected to be exposed to multiple climate hazards in the
21st century because of the projected ocean warming, oxygen loss, and decrease in POC flux (Table 5.5) under scenarios of greenhouse
gas emissions. The average changes in these climate hazards for coral-water corals are projected to be almost halved under RCP2.6
relative to RCP8.5 (Table 5.5). Under RCP8.5, 95 + 2% (95% Cl) of cold-water coral habitats are projected to experience animal
biomass decline (-8.6 + 2.0%) globally by 2091-2100 relative to 2006-2015, driven by a projected 21 + 9% drop in POC flux

estimates. Regionally, suitable habitat for coral-water corals in the NE Atlantic is projected to decrease with multiple climatic
hazards (warming, acidification, decreases in oxygen and POC flux) under RCP8.5 for 2081-2100 (FAO, 2019), with up to 98% loss
of suitable habitat by 2099 due to shoaling aragonite saturation horizons. In the Southern hemisphere, a tolerance threshold of 7°C

the mechanistic understanding of how climatic drivers will affect
the different components of the biological pump in the epipelagic

Unlike the open ocean where detection and attribution of climate

causes most of the adjacent marine ecosystems to be impacted by
local anthropogenic disturbances such as eutrophication, coastline

Scheren, 2016; Maavara et al. 2017; Dunn et al. 2018) (Section 4.3.2.2,
Cross-Chapter Box 9). Climate driven impacts interact with such
human disturbances and pose a serious risk to ecosystems structure
and functioning (Gattuso et al. 2015). Projections of the ecological
impacts of climate change in coastal ecosystems must therefore deal
with many emerging complexities such as the differentiation between
the long-term climate trends (e.g., progressive ocean acidification) and
the short-term natural fluctuations (Boyd et al. 2018), ranging from the
seasons to interannual climate oscillations like El Nifio. The ‘time of

"The world’s shelf seas and coastal waters (hereafter ‘coastal seas’)
extend from the coastline to the 200 m water depth contour. They
encompass diverse ecosystems, including estuaries, sandy beaches,
kelp forests, mangroves and coral reefs. Although they occupy a small
part of the global ocean (7.6%), coastal seas provide up to 30% of
global marine primary production and about 50% of the organic carbon
supplied to the deep ocean (Chen, 2003; Bauer et al. 2013) (Sections
5.2.4.1 and 5.4.1.1). Coastal seas include several frontal and upwelling
areas (Box 5.3) that support high fisheries yields (Scales et al. 2014), and
productive coastal ecosystems, such as wetlands (McLeod et al. 2011).
Mangrove forests, seagrass meadows and kelp forests form important
habitats supporting high biodiversity while offering opportunities for
climate change mitigation and adaptation (Section 5.5.1.2) (Duarte
et al. 2013), with mangrove forests providing physical protection
against extreme events such as storms and floods (Kelleway et al.
2017a) (Sections 5.4.1.2 and 4.3.3.5.4). The regional characteristics
and habitat heterogeneity of many coastal seas support endemic fauna
and flora (e.g., seagrass meadows in the Mediterranean), which makes
them particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts with high risk
of diversity loss and alterations in ecosystem structure and functioning

"Observations since AR5 provide further evidence that SLR increases
seawater intrusions and raises salinity in estuaries. Salinisation of
estuaries can be exacerbated by droughts and modifications of
drainage area by human activities (Ross et al.2015; Cardoso-Mohedano
et al. 2018; Hallett et al. 2018; Zahid et al. 2018). The changing salinity
gradients in estuaries have been linked to the observed upstream
expansion of brackish and marine benthic and pelagic communities,

(Robins et al. 2016; Raimonet and Cloern, 2017; Hallett et al. 2018;

distribution of benthic species in estuaries is strongly determined by
sediment properties like grain size, the gradient of sediment types in
estuaries can be a barrier to upstream shifts of brackish and marine
benthic biota, leading to a reduction in species richness in mid- to
upper-estuarine areas and altering food webs (Little et al. 2017;
Hudson et al. 2018; Addino et al. 2019). Similarly, estuarine wetlands
(Section 5.3.2) and tidal flats (Murray et al. 2019) have reduced their

since the 1970s (Wang and Cai, 2013; Delworth and Zeng, 2016;

have increased nutrients and sediment loads in estuaries (Tweedley

under future emission scenarios. These projected changes vary
regionally and between different types of wetlands. Gaining area
may be possible, at least locally, if vertical sediment accretion
occurs together with lateral re-accommodation (Brown et al.
2018b; Schuerch et al. 2018) (Section 4.3.3.5.1). Local losses may
also be higher; for example, in New England, where regional rates

projections suggest that 40-95% of salt marshes will be submerged

"Nearly 50% of the pre-industrial, natural extent of global coastal
wetlands have been lost since the 19th century (Li et al. 2018a). Such
a reduction in wetlands is primarily caused by non-climatic drivers
such as alteration of drainage, agriculture development, coastal
settlement, hydrological alterations and reductions in sediment
supply (Adam, 2002; Wang et al. 2014; Kroeger et al. 2017; Thomas
et al. 2017; Li et al. 2018a). However, large-scale mortality events
of mangroves from ‘natural causes’ has also occurred globally since
the 1960s; ~70% of this loss has resulted from low frequency,
high intensity weather events, such as tropical cyclones (45%) and
climatic extremes such as droughts, SLR variations and heat waves
(Sippo et al. 2018) (high confidence). In Australia, the mangrove
loss due to heat waves accounted for 22% of global mangrove
forests (Sippo et al. 2018), with negative impacts on ecosystem
biodiversity and the provisioning of services (Carugati et al. 2018;
Saintilan et al. 2018) (Section 5.4). In coastal areas with sufficient
sediment supply across the Indo-Pacific region, inland expansion
of mangroves is occurring as a result of vertical accretion and root
growth, allowing them to keep pace with current SLR (Lovelock
et al. 2015). In seagrass meadows, temperature is the main limiting
range factor, and over the past decades there have been several
global die-off events (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018). The vulnerability
of seagrasses to warming varies locally depending on soil accretion
and herbivory (El-Hacen et al. 2018; Marba et al. 2018; Vergés
et al. 2018) and on the population assemblages (e.g., expansion
at high latitudes) (Beca-Carretero et al. 2018; Duarte et al. 2018).
The compounding effects of heat waves, hypersaline conditions
and increased turbidity and nutrient levels associated with floods
have been shown to cause negative changes in the composition
and biomass of co-occurring seagrass species (Nowicki et al.

For example, in Shark Bay, Western Australia, a marine heat wave
in austral summer 2010/2011 caused widespread losses (36% of
area) of seagrass meadows, with negative implications for carbon
storage (Arias-Ortiz et al. 2018). The poleward expansion of tropical
mangroves into subtropical salt marshes as a result of increase in
temperature has been also observed over the past half century on
five continents (Saintilan et al. 2014; Saintilan et al. 2018) (high

the loggerhead respectively in the Mediterranean (Varela et al.

Africa (Patricio et al. 2019). Moreover, benthic crustaceans of sandy
beaches, including isopods, crabs and amphipods, generally follow
the temperature-body size gradient in which body size decreases
towards warmer lower-latitude regions (Jaramillo et al. 2017).
Assuming that the physiological underpinning of the relationship

crustaceans is expected to decrease under warming (low evidence,

Krause-Jensen, 2018; Ullah et al. 2018; Milazzo et al. 2019). Immobile
intertidal organisms are especially vulnerable to warming, due to
the potential for extreme heat exposure during low tide emersion
and prolonged desiccation events (Hawkins et al. 2016; Zamir
et al. 2018) (high confidence). This effect is expected to lower the
upper vertical limit of intertidal communities (Hawkins et al. 2016),
reducing their suitable habitat (Harley, 2011), and accompanied by
temperature-induced increases in predation by consumers (Sanford,
1999). While previous studies have documented a poleward shift in
species distributions of rocky intertidal and reef algae (Duarte et al.
2013; Nicastro et al. 2013) and faunal species (Barry et al. 1995;
Mieszkowska et al. 2006; Lima et al. 2007), local extinctions at the
equatorial or warm edge of species ranges are increasingly being
attributed to climate change (Yeruham et al. 2015; Sorte et al. 2017)

among rocky shore species (Gazeau et al. 2014; Jurgens et al. 2015)
and subsequent declines or losses in important species can have
cascading effects on the whole intertidal community and the services
it provides (Gatti et al. 2017; Sorte et al. 2017; Sunday et al. 2017).
Coralline fauna adapted to narrow environmental conditions seem
especially vulnerable to heat waves, with observed mass mortalities in
the Adriatic Sea in response to extreme summer temperatures (Kruzi¢

warming could exacerbate the impacts of heat stress on rocky
intertidal communities (Lima et al. 2016). Nevertheless, experimental
data indicate that some coralline algae that are well adapted to highly
variable transitional environments can tolerate the warming projected

"New empirical eco-physiological studies in combination with field

forest degradation and range shifts (Franco et al. 2018b; Wernberg

acidification cause kelp degradation and disease-like symptoms,
with detrimental effects on photosynthetic efficiency (Qiu et al.

herbivorous fish species in temperate kelp forest has been observed
to enhance ecosystem degradation (Vergés et al. 2016). However,
invader seaweed species driven by warming can create more complex
trophic interactions, reducing the consumption by herbivorous
gastropods (Miranda et al. 2019). Increased physical stress by storm
events also alters the kelps community, affecting the recruitment
time of kelp species. The resulting dominance of younger stages
favors species with a year-round spore production or an opportunistic

other ecosystem components by providing food, substrate for
spawning and habitat that mediate trophic interactions (O'Brien et al.

production and dependent flora and fauna species (Teagle and Smale,

similar in morphology, but the cold water L. hyperborea hosts sessile
communities of algae and invertebrates 12 times more diverse and
richer in biomass than the warm water kelp species (Teagle and Smale,

ecosystems, providing food, nutrition, income and livelihoods for many
millions of people around the world (FAO, 2018). Globally, total fish
catches amount to 80-105 Mt annually in the 2000s (FAO, 2016; FAO
2018; Pauly and Zeller, 2016), directly generating over 80 billion USD
of revenue (Sumaila et al. 2015). Most global fisheries are considered
to be fully- to over-exploited (FAO, 2018). Over 80% of the global fish

20% from the high seas (Sumaila et al. 2015) (Figure 5.17).

throughout the ocean, from shallow water to the deep sea

1.5°C of global warming, with losses being even greater at 2°C of
global warming. These reductions in services are driven by decreasing
ocean productivity, biogeographic shifts, damage to ecosystems,
loss of fisheries productivity and changes to ocean chemistry (high

"The ecosystems at moderate to high risk under future emission
scenarios (Figure 5.16) are mangrove forests (transition from
moderate to high risk at 2.5°C-2.7°C of global sea surface

marshes (transition from moderate to high risk at 1.8°C-2.7°C and
from high to very high risk at 3.0°C-3.4°C) (medium confidence).
Mangrove forests and salt marshes can initially cope with SLR by
plant biomass accumulation, soil accretion and sediment relocation,
but the evidence shows they are unlikely to withstand the SLR
projected under RCP8.5. Moreover, pervasive coastal squeeze and
human-driven habitat deterioration will reduce the natural capacity
of these ecosystems to adapt to climate impacts (high confidence).
Projected warming and SLR by the end of the century will continue to
expand salinisation and hypoxia in estuaries with high risk of impacts
for benthic and pelagic biota. These impacts will be more pronounced
under RCP8.5 in more vulnerable eutrophic, shallow and microtidal
estuaries in temperate and high latitudes. Erosion in sandy beach

adaptive capacity, as they are highly sensitive to ocean warming,
marine heat waves and acidification. For example, kelp forests at low-
latitudes and temperate seagrass meadows with endemic species will
continue to retreat with more frequent extreme temperatures, and their
low dispersal ability will elevate the risk of local extinction. Biogenic
shallow reefs with calcified organisms (e.g., corals, mussels, calcified
algae) are particularly sensitive to ocean acidification and compound
effects with rising temperatures, deoxygenation, SLR and increasing
extreme events, making these ecosystems highly vulnerable (with
low resilience) to future emission scenarios. Furthermore, almost all
coral reefs will greatly decline from their current levels, even if global
warming remains below 2°C (very high confidence). Any coral reefs
that do survive to the end of the century will not be the same because
of irreversible changes in habitat structure and functioning, including
species extinctions and food web disruptions; these changes are
already taking place (e.g., the Caribbean reefs). The transition to new
ecosystem states driven by unpredictable pulses of disturbance and
progressive climate hazards will have negative impacts on ecosystem

temperature, with the direction and magnitude of the relationship
varying between regions and fish stocks (Cheung et al. 2008; McOwen
et al. 2015; Britten et al. 2016; Stock et al. 2017). The maximum
catch potential of large marine ecosystems generally increases with
their NPP and energy transfer efficiency, but the relative importance
of total NPP to fisheries production is lower in nutrient-poor systems
with microbially-dominated foodwebs (Section 5.2) and empirical
relationships between NPP and fisheries production over-estimate
potential catches in polar regions (Stock et al. 2017) (Chapter 3).
Here, potential fish catch or maximum catch potential refers to the
potential of the fish stocks to provide long-term fish catches; it is
considered a proxy of maximum sustainable yield (MSY). However,
the actual catches realised by fisheries will depend strongly on
past and present fishing effort and the exploitation status of the
resources (Cheung et al. 2018a; Barange, 2019). Observed variations
between regions suggest that changes in temperature and NPP in the

"39 large marine ecosystems and the high seas suggest that average
recruitment to the stocks has declined by around 3% of the historical
maximum per decade with variations between regions and stocks
(Britten et al. 2016). The declines (69% of the studied stocks, 31 of
the 39 assessed large marine ecosystems) are significantly related to
estimated chlorophyll a concentration and the intensity of fishing,
with the North Atlantic showing the steepest declines (Britten et al.
2016). In addition, recent meta-analysis of population data from
235 fish stocks worldwide from 1930 to 2010 suggest that the
maximum catch potential from these populations decreased by 4.1%
(95% confidence span 9.0% decline to 0.3% increase) during this
period with variations between fish stocks and regions (Free et al.
2019). Specifically, temperature is a significant factor explaining
changes in catch potential of 12% of the fish stocks, with East Asian
regions having the largest stock declines related to warming. In
intermediate latitudes across the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans,
catches of tropical tunas, including skipjack and yellowfin tuna, are
significantly and positively related to increases in SST, although the
overall catches across latitudinal zones do not show significant
change (Monllor-Hurtado et al. 2017). Observational evidence from
spatial and temporal linkages between catches and oceanographic
variables therefore supports the conclusions from AR5 WGIl and
SR15 that potential fisheries catches have already been impacted by
the effects of warming and changing primary production on growth,
reproduction and survival of fish stocks (robust evidence, high

attribution of climatic drivers between regions and fish stocks, and
the availability of datasets is biased towards mid-latitude areas and
epipelagic and coastal ecosystems. As a result, quantitative attribution
of climate impacts on the productivity of specific fish stocks has low

worldwide that were considered overfished were most sensitive to
warming (Essington et al. 2015; Britten et al. 2016; Free et al. 2019).
This suggest that climatic drivers and overfishing have interacted
synergistically in impacting some fish stocks and their catches (high

"Although demersal fisheries in the deep ocean represent a small
proportion of global fisheries catches, they are economically valuable
for some countries, and there is increasing commercial interest in
mesopelagic (deep pelagic ocean) fisheries (St. John et al. 2016).
Commercially-exploited fish and shellfish from deep sea ecosystems
will be exposed to climate risks from physical and chemical changes
in ocean conditions including warming, decreased oxygen, reduced
aragonite saturation state, and decreased supply of particulate organic
matter from the upper ocean (Section 5.2.3, 5.2.4) (FAO, 2019).
These biogeochemical changes may reduce the growth, reproduction
and survivorship of deep-ocean fish stocks, which will alter their
distributions, in similar ways to those in the surface ocean, impacting
their fish catch potential (FAO, 2019). For example, in the eastern
Pacific near-bottom oxygen concentration is positively correlated with
biomass of commercially harvested species (Keller et al. 2010) and catch
per unit effort (Banse, 1968; Rosenberg et al. 1983; Keller et al. 2015);
some commercially harvested species only appear during oxygenation
events associated with El Nifio (Arntz et al. 2006). In the mesopelagic
Zone, expansion of the OMZ results in habitat compression that can
increase catchability of fish stocks such as tunas (Prince et al. 2010;
Stramma et al. 2011). Also, as OMZ expands, the potential may exist
for increased availability and harvest of hypoxia-tolerant species such
as Humboldt squid (Dosidicus gigas), thornyheads (Sebastolobus spp.)
or dover sole (Microstomus pacificus) (Gilly et al. 2013; Gallo and Levin,

"Tropical oceans are projected to experience much larger impacts (three
times or more decrease in catch potential) than the global average,
particularly the western central Pacific Ocean, eastern central Atlantic
Ocean and the western Indian Ocean, by the end of the 21st century
under RCP8.5 (Blanchard et al. 2017). For example, around the exclusive
economic zones of the Pacific Islands states, more than 50% of exploited
fishes and invertebrates are projected to become locally extinct in many
regions by 2100 relative to the recent past under RCP8.5 (Asch et al.
2018). These factors cause 74% of the area to experience a projected
loss in catch potential of more than 50%. Under RCP2.6, the area of
large projected catch loss is projected to be halved (Asch et al. 2018).
However, while temperate commercially-important tunas species
such as albacore, Atlantic and southern bluefin) are projected to shift
poleward and decrease in abundance in the tropics, some tropical
species such as skipjack tuna are projected to remain abundant, but with
changes in distribution patterns in low-latitude regions by the mid-21st
century, with some models projecting subsequent decrease under
RCP8.5 (Lehodey et al. 2013; Dueri et al. 2014; Erauskin-Extramiana
et al. 2019). Recent evidence therefore supports the conclusion from
previous assessments (Portner et al. 2014; Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018)
that low-latitude fish catch potential are projected to have a high risk
of climate impacts, which will be exacerbated by higher greenhouse
gas emissions (medium evidence, high agreement, high confidence).
Tropical fish catch potential of some species resilient to the changing
environment may have lower climate risk in the near-term although
their risk increases substantially further into the 21st century under
RCP8.5 (medium confidence). In contrast, the catch potential in the

"Based on CMIP5 ESM projections of changes in temperature, net
primary production, oxygen, salinity and sea ice extent, two marine
ecosystem and fisheries models project a decrease in maximum
catch potential under RCP 2.6 of 3.9-8.5% by 2041-2060 and
3.4-6.4% by 2081-2100 relative to 1986-2005 (based on model
projections described in Barange et al. 2018). Under RCP 8.5, the
projected decrease was larger: 8.6-14.2% and 20.5-24.1% by
the mid- and end- of the 21st century (Figure 5.18). The trends
agree with the projected changes in total marine animal biomass
for the 21st century (Blanchard et al. 2017; Lotze et al. 2018)
(Section 5.2.3). A single fisheries model with atmospheric warming
projected a potential catch loss of 3.4 million tonnes and decreases
of 6.4% of catch potential of the exploited species per degree
Celsius atmospheric warming relative to 1951-1960 level (Cheung
et al. 2016b) (Figure 5.18). Interactions between temperature, net
primary production and transfer efficiency of energy across the
foodweb are projected to amplify these trends, with projected
decreases greater than 50% in some regions by 2100 under high
emissions scenarios (Stock et al. 2017). Thus, there is high model
agreement that ocean warming and changes in NPP in the 21st
century will reduce the global maximum catch potential, particularly
in tropical oceans (high confidence) and alter the distribution and
composition of exploited species (high confidence). The projected
risk of these fisheries impacts increases with increasing greenhouse
gas emissions (high confidence). However, given the uncertainties
of projected changes in ocean conditions from ESMs (Section 5.2.2),
and that most global scale fisheries models are largely driven by
changes in temperature and primary production while other changes
in ocean biogeochemical changes are not explicitly considered
(Tittensor et al. 2018), the quantitative magnitude of the projected
changes in maximum catch potential is considered to have medium
and /ow confidence at global and regional scales, respectively. Given
the significant interactions between catch potential and level of
fisheries exploitation, the realised catches in the 21st century would
depend on future scenarios of fishing and fisheries governance

also by fishing effects on the exploited populations. For example, the anchoveta population collapsed in the Humboldt Current after an
EI Nifio in the 1970s (Gutiérrez et al. 2017). Because small pelagic fisheries from upwelling regions are the main source of the global
fishmeal market, decreases in their catches increase the international fishmeal price, increasing the price of other food commodities (like
aquaculture derived fish) that rely on fishmeal for their production (Merino et al. 2010; Carlson et al. 2017).

high latitudes for Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)8.5, with an overall reduction in either upwelling intensity or extension
(Belmadani et al. 2014; Rykaczewski et al. 2015; Sousa et al. 2017). However, coastal warming and wind intensification may lead to
variable countervailing responses to upwelling intensification at local scales (Garcia-Reyes et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2015a; Oyarztin and

decreases in pH and dissolved oxygen affecting organisms and ecosystems (Alin et al. 2012; Bednarsek et al. 2014; Breitburg et a

"Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUS) are among the world’s most productive ocean ecosystems (Kampf and Chapman, 2016)
They directly support livelihoods in coastal communities and provide many wider benefits to human society (Garcia-Reyes et al. 2015
Levin and Le Bris, 2015). The high productivity of EBUS is supported by the upwelling of cold and nutrient-rich waters, itself driver
by equator-ward alongshore winds that cause the displacement of surface waters offshore and their replacement by deeper waters
Total annual fish catches from the four main EBUS (California Current, Humboldt Current, Canary Current and Benguela Current

Upwelling of cold deeper water also increases the condensation of humid air in coastal areas, benefitting coastal vegetation anc
agriculture and suppressing forest fires (Black et al. 2014). The high concentration of marine mammals attracted by the productive
upwelling ecosystem support lucrative eco-tourism, such as whale watching in the California Current (Kampf and Chapman, 2016)
The total economic value of the goods and services provided by the Humboldt Current alone is estimated to be 19.45 billion USD pe

fisheries catches (medium confidence). However, the direction and magnitude of observed changes vary among and within EBUS,

which are predicted to emerge primarily in the second half of the 21st century (medium confidence) (Brady et al. 2017). Given the high

with a strong dependence on EBUS services and low adaptive capacity, such as those along the Canary Current system (Belhabib et al.

"Coastal vegetation-rich ecosystems such as mangrove forests, coral
reefs and salt marshes reduce storm impacts, protect the coastline
from erosion, and help buffer the impacts of SLR, wave action and
even moderate-sized tsunamis (Orth et al. 2006; Ferrario et al. 2014;
Rao et al. 2015) (Section 5.5.2.2). Their loss or degradation under
climate change (Sections 5.3) would therefore reduce the benefits
of these regulatory services to coastal human communities (Perry

disasters (Rao et al. 2015) (high confidence). In some locations
where climate-induced range expansion of coastal wetlands occurs,
regulatory services such as storm protection and nutrient storage
may be enhanced; however, the replacement of an existing ecosystem
by others (e.g., salt marshes replaced by mangroves) may reduce
habitat availability for fauna requiring specific vegetation structure

"Coastal blue carbon ecosystems provide climate regulatory services
through their carbon removal and storage (Section 5.3.3). The current
rates of loss of blue carbon ecosystems, partly due to climate change
(Section 5.3) results in release of their stored CO2 to the atmosphere
(Section 5.5.1.2.2). However, increases in carbon sequestration are
also possible; for example, temperature-driven displacement of
salt marsh plants by mangrove trees may increase carbon uptake
in coastal wetlands (Megonigal et al. 2016). Different rates of
SLR may have opposite effects, with potential increases in net
carbon uptake for slowly rising sea levels (assuming inland habitat
migration is possible), but net carbon release for more rapid SLR
(Figure 5.19). Such contrasting feedbacks between scenarios arise
from the different responses of plant biomass, sediment accretion
and inundation that control the overall response of vegetated coastal
ecosystems to rising sea level (Gonneea et al. 2019). Thus, under high
emission scenarios, SLR and warming are expected to reduce carbon
sequestration by vegetated coastal ecosystems (medium confidence);
however, under conditions of slow SLR, there may be net increase in
carbon uptake by some coastal wetlands (medium confidence).

Vibrio pathogens. These effects have been simulated in a global-scale
model that relates occurrences of Vibrio with SST, pH, dissolved oxygen
and chlorophyll a concentration under the SRES B1 scenario (Escobar

suitable for Vibrio is projected between 2015 and 2050 for both RCP4.5

low confidence for future climate change effects on HABs (AR5 Chapters 5, 6) (Portner et al. 2014; Wong et al. 2014b). Since ARS,
HABs have increasingly affected human society, with negative impacts on food provisioning, tourism, the economy and human health

"The aesthetic appreciation of natural places is one of the
fundamental ways in which people relate to their environment.
ARS5 noted that climate change may impact marine species with
aesthetic importance that affect local and indigenous cultures,
local economies and challenge cultural preservation (Portner et al.
2014). Evidence since AR5 confirms that aesthetically appreciated
aspects of marine ecosystems are important for supporting local
and international economies (especially through tourism), human
well-being, and stewardship. For example, Marshall et al. (2018)
found that aesthetic values are a critically important cultural value
for all cultural groups, and are important for maintaining sense of
place, pride, identity and opportunities for inspiration, spirituality,
recreation and well-being. However, climate change induced
degradation and loss of biodiversity and habitats (Section 5.2.3,
5.2.4, 5.3) can also negatively impact the ecosystem features that
are currently appreciated by human communities, such as coral reefs,
mangroves, charismatic species (such as some marine mammals and
seabirds) and geomorphological features (e.g., sandy beaches). There
are also aesthetic and inspirational values of marine biodiversity and
ecosystems that are important to the psychological and spiritual
well-being of people, including film, literature, art and recreation
(Pescaroli and Magni, 2015). Other cultural dimensions that are
becoming more widely acknowledged as potentially disturbed by
climate change include the appreciation of scientific, artistic, spiritual,
and health opportunities, as well as appreciation of biodiversity,
lifestyle and aesthetics (Marshall et al. 2018). Thus, climate change
may also affect the way in which marine ecosystems support human
well-being through cultural dimensions. However, the difficulties in
evaluating the importance of aesthetic aspects of marine ecosystems,

"Global gross revenues from marine fisheries were around 150 billion
in 2010 USD (Swartz et al. 2013; Tai et al. 2017). Capture fisheries
provide full-time and part-time jobs for an estimated 260 + 6 million
people in the 2000s period, of whom 22 + 0.45 million are small-scale
fishers (Teh and Sumaila, 2013). Small-scale fisheries are important
for the livelihood and viability of coastal communities worldwide
(Chuenpagdee, 2011). ARS concluded with /ow confidence that
climate change will lead to a global decrease in revenue with regional
differences that are driven by spatial variations of climate impacts on

aquaculture to ocean acidification. For example, the oyster industry
in the Pacific has lost nearly 110 million USD in annual revenue due
to ocean acidification (Ekstrom et al. 2015). This section examines
the rapidly growing literature assessing the risks of climate change

"Since ARS, projections on climate change impacts on the economics
of marine fisheries have incorporated a broader range of social-
economic considerations. Driven by shifts in species distributions and
maximum catch potential of fish stocks (Section 5.4.1), if the ex-vessel
price of catches remains the same, marine fisheries maximum
revenue potential are projected to be negatively impacted in 89% of
the world’s fishing countries under the RCP8.5 scenario by the 2050s
relative to the current status, with projected global decreases of
10.4 + 4.2% and 7.1 + 3.5% under RCP8.5 and RCP2.6, respectively,
by 2050 relative to 2000 (Lam et al. 2016). While the projected
changes in revenues are sensitive to price scenarios (Lam et al. 2016),
future maximum revenue potential is reduced under high emission
scenarios (Sumaila et al. 2019). For example, when the elasticity
of seafood price in relation to their supply was modelled explicitly,
fisheries maximum revenue potential under a 1.5°C atmospheric
warming scenario was projected to be higher than for 3.5°C warming
by 7.4% (13.1 billion USD) + 2.3%, across projections from three
CMIP5 models (Sumaila et al. 2019). Accounting for the subsequent
impacts on the dependent communities and relative to the 1.5°C

workers’ incomes of 7.8% (3.7 billion USD) + 2.3% and an increase
in households’ seafood expenditure by the global population of 3.2%

"Climate change may alter the environment too rapidly for cultural
adaptation to keep pace. This is because the culture that forms
around a natural environment can be so integral to people's lives
that disassociation from that environment can induce a sense of
disorientation and disempowerment (Fisher and Brown, 2015).
The adaptive capacity of people to moderate or influence cultural
impacts, and thereby reduce vulnerability to such impacts, is also
culturally determined (Cinner et al. 2018). For example, when
a resource user such as a fisher, farmer, or forester is suddenly faced
with the prospect that their resource-based occupation is no longer
viable, they lose not only a means of earning an income but also an
important part of their identity (Marshall et al. 2012; Tidball, 2012).
Loss of identity can, in turn, have severe economic, psychological and
cultural impacts (Turner et al. 2008). Climate change can quickly alter
the quality of, or access to, a natural resource through degradation
or coastal inundation, so that livelihoods and lifestyles are no longer
able to be supported by that resource. When people are displaced
from places that they value, there is strong evidence that their
cultures are diminished, and in many cases endangered. There are no
effective substitutions for, or adequate compensation for, lost sites
of significance (Adger et al. 2012). As sensitive marine ecosystems
such as coral reefs and kelp forest are impacted by climate change at
rapid rate (Section 5.3), these can lead to the loss of part of people's
cultural identity and values beyond the rate at which identify and

"Redistribution of marine species in response to direct and indirect
effects of climate change may also disrupt existing marine resource

fisheries management for North Atlantic mackerel (Spijkers and
Boonstra, 2017) and Pacific salmon (Miller and Russ, 2014). These
disagreements have stressed diplomatic relations in some cases
(Pinsky et al. 2018). Decreases and fluctuations in fish stock
abundance and fish catches have also contributed to past disputes

climate change, shifts in abundance and distribution of fish stocks
are projected to intensify in the 21st century (Sections 5.2.3, 5.3,

existing overexploited or depleted fish stocks, is projected to lead
to substantially higher global profits (154%), harvest (34%), and
biomass (60%) in the future, relative to a no adaptation scenario.
However, the total profit, harvest and biomass are negatively affected

"The economic implications of climate change on fisheries vary
between regions and countries because of the differences in exposure
to revenue changes and the sensitivity and adaptive capacity of the
fishing communities to these changes (Hilmi et al. 2015). Regions
where the maximum potential revenue is projected to decrease
coincide with areas where indicators such as human development
index suggest high economic vulnerability to climate change
(Barbier, 2015; Lam et al. 2016). Many coastal communities in these
regions rely heavily on fish and fisheries as a major source of animal
proteins, nutritional needs, income and job opportunities (FAO,
2019). Negative impacts on the catch and total fisheries revenues
for these countries are expected to have greater implications for
jobs, economies, food and nutritional security than the impacts on
regions with high Human Development Index (Allison et al. 2009;
Srinivasan et al. 2010; Golden et al. 2016; Blasiak et al. 2017). Climate
change impacts to coral reefs and other fish habitats, as well as to
targeted fish and invertebrate species themselves are expected to
reduce harvests from small-scale, coastal fisheries by up to 20% by

"Similarly, global warming and changing weather patterns may have
a substantial impact on global trade and transport pathways (Koetse
and Rietveld, 2009); for example, the reduction in sea ice in the Arctic
Ocean during summer opens up the possibility for sea transport on the
Northwest or Northeast Passage for several months per year (Ng et al.
2018) (Section 3.5.3.2). Both routes may provide opportunities for
more efficient transport between North America, Europe, Russia
and China for fleets with established Arctic equipment, and may
open up access to known natural resources which have so far been
covered by ice (Guy and Lasserre, 2016). However, whether the Arctic
shipping routes will be a realistic alternative depends not only on
regulatory frameworks and economic aspects (such as infrastructure
and reliability of the routes) but also on societal trends and values,
demographics and tourism demand (Prowse et al. 2009; Wassmann

Simultaneously, shipping routes through the Arctic pose additional
risk from human impact such as pollution, introduction of invasive

"The term ‘blue carbon’ was originally used to cover biological carbon
in all marine ecosystems (Nellemann et al. 2009). Subsequent
use of the term has focused on carbon-accumulating coastal
habitats structured by rooted plants, such as mangroves, tidal salt
marshes and seagrass meadows, that are relatively amenable to
management (McLeod et al. 2011; Pendleton et al. 2012; Thomas,
2014; Macreadie et al. 2017a; Alongi, 2018; Windham-Myers et al.

of freshwater and saline wetland types are assisted by standardised
approaches (Nahlik and Fennessy, 2016; Vazquez-Gonzalez et al.

blue carbon (Krause-Jensen and Duarte, 2016; Krause-Jensen et al.

processing, their climate mitigation potential is assessed separately

ocean renewable energy are identified in Section 5.4.2.3.2. Here, in
accordance with the approved scoping of this report, the assessment
of mitigation options is limited to the management of natural ocean
processes, that is, requiring policy intervention, with a focus on ‘blue
carbon’. Natural processes per se, although important to the climate
system and the global carbon cycle, are not a mitigation response. Two
management approaches are possible: first, actions to maintain the
integrity of natural carbon stores, thereby decreasing their potential
release of greenhouse gases, whether caused by human or climate-
drivers; and second, through actions that enhance the longterm
(century-scale) removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere by
marine systems, primarily by biological means.

of women to harassment and abuse as the flooding upends normal

change may negatively affect our ability to achieve “gender equality”

changing recreational, aesthetic, and spiritual experiences also affect
our ability to achieve ‘sustainable cities and communities’ (SDG 11)

to achieving the remaining SDGs are less clear. However, the SDGs
are interlinked, and achieving SDG 14, and especially the targets of

as well as eliminating illegal fishing and overfishing, will benefits

"In the open ocean, the biological carbon pump is driven by the
combination of photosynthesis by phytoplankton and downward
transfer of particulate carbon by a variety of processes (Henson et al.
2010; DeVries et al. 2017); it results in large-scale transfer of around
10 GtC yr’ carbon from near-surface waters to the ocean interior
(Boyd et al. 2019). Most of this carbon is respired in the mesopelagic
and contributes to the 37,000 GtC inventory of DIC, with around
~0.1 GtC yr eventually being permanently removed in deep
sea sediments (Cartapanis et al. 2018). In addition, the microbial
carbon pump (Jiao et al. 2010) produces refractory dissolved
organic molecules throughout the water column at a rate of around
0.4 GtC yr“! (Jiao et al. 2014b), which due to their residence time of
hundreds to thousands of years maintain the 700 GtC inventory of
dissolved organic carbon in the ocean (Jiao et al. 2010; Jiao et al.
201 4a; Legendre et al. 2015; Jiao et al. 2018a). The natural removal of
carbon by the various carbon pumps is closely balanced by upwelling
and outgassing, with the ocean a moderate source of CO2 under
pre-industrial conditions (Ciais et al. 2013). The mitigation potential

"Mitigation through emission reduction can therefore be achieved by
habitat protection, to greatly reduce or end the human-driven loss
of mangrove, salt marsh and seagrass ecosystems. Such action could
potentially produce nationally-significant mitigation (>1% of fossil
fuel emissions) for several countries (Taillardat et al. 2018). However,
there are still many uncertainties in quantifying carbon release due
to habitat degradation and loss (Lovelock et al. 2017), and hence in
determining emission reductions. Furthermore, this mitigation option
is not available to those countries where habitat loss is not currently
occurring, for example, in Bangladesh (Taillardat et al. 2018). Since
legal structures already exist in many countries to protect coastal
wetlands, the main policy need may be the enforcement of national

processing riverine organic carbon. However, the natural carbon
dynamics of these systems have been greatly changed by human
activities (Regnier et al. 2013; Cloern et al. 2016; Day and Rybczyk,

coastal land-use change (Ramesh et al. 2015; Li et al. 2018a); indirect
effects include increased nutrient delivery and other changes in
river catchments (Jiao et al. 2011; Regnier et al. 2013), and marine

"These three vegetated coastal habitats are characterised by high, yet
variable, organic carbon storage in their soils and sediments on a per
unit area basis (high confidence). In the humid tropics, mangrove
below-ground organic carbon is typically 500-1000 tC ha™' (Donato
et al. 2011; Alongi and Mukhopadhyay, 2015; Howard et al. 2017),
although only ~50 tC ha! in arid regions (Almahasheer et al.

organic carbon storage, ranging from 15-1000 tC ha"" (top 1 m)
with mean of 165 tC ha""! (Kelleway et al. 2016; Macreadie et al.

400-1600 tC ha“ but can exceed 2000 tC ha“ (Serrano et al. 2014).
These accumulations have occurred over decadal to millennial time
scales (McKee et al. 2007; Lo lacono et al. 2008). Such blue carbon
stock values are similar to freshwater wetlands and peat, but higher

"When vegetated coastal ecosystems are disturbed, a proportion of
their stored carbon is released back to the atmosphere, along with
other greenhouse gases (Marba and Duarte, 2009; Duarte et al. 2010;
Pendleton et al. 2012; Lovelock et al. 2017). Globally, around 25-50%
of vegetated coastal habitats have already been lost or degraded
due to coastal agricultural developments, urbanisation and other
human disturbance during the past 100 years (McLeod et al. 2011).
The highest historical losses (60-90%) have occurred in Europe and
China (Jickells et al. 2015; Gu et al. 2018; Li et al. 2018a). Current
losses are estimated at 0.2-3.0% yr, depending on vegetation
type and location (FAO et al. 2014; Alongi and Mukhopadhyay, 2015;

"Around 90 restoration and rehabilitation projects for mangroves
have been documented (L6pez-Portillo et al. 2017), with associated
development of a range of restoration evaluation methods (Zhao

and seagrass restoration by van Katwijk et al. (2016). Consistent
conclusions, supported by other studies (Bayraktarov et al. 2016; Wylie
et al. 2016) are that: natural regeneration increases the likelihood
of longterm survival; higher success rates are achieved with strong
stakeholder engagement; and it is critical that the (human) factors
causing original loss and degradation have been properly addressed
(high confidence).

"The alternative mitigation approach using coastal blue carbon
ecosystems is to enhance the natural carbon uptake of such habitats,
not only by increasing their spatial coverage through habitat
restoration and new habitat creation, but also by taking management
measures to maximise the carbon uptake and storage for existing
coastal ecosystems. Such measures include reducing anthropogenic
nutrient inputs and other pollutants; restoring hydrology, by removing
barriers to tidal flow and sediment delivery; and reinstating predators
(to reduce carbon loss caused by some bioturbators) (Macreadie et al.
2017a). Per unit area of habitat created, restored or rehabilitated,
such actions may offer high rates of carbon removal: widely-quoted
values are 226 + 39 gC m yr for mangroves, 218 + 24 gC m yr""
for salt marsh and 138 + 38 gC m™' yr for seagrass ecosystems
(McLeod et al. 2011; Isensee et al. 2019).

"Emissions of other greenhouse gases also need to be taken
into account (Keller, 2019b). Methane release from mangrove
habitats can reduce the scale of their climatic benefits by
18-22% (Adams et al. 2012; Chen and Ganapin, 2016; Chmura
et al. 2016; Rosentreter et al. 2018; Cameron et al. 2019) and
nitrous oxide and methane together may offset salt marsh CO2
uptake by 24-31% (Adams et al. 2012). Nitrous oxide emissions
are strongly affected by nutrient loading (Chmura et al. 2016);
under pristine conditions, mangroves can provide a sink rather
than a source (Maher et al. 2016). Note that values of the ‘offset’
depend on the metrics used for determining CO2 equivalents.

Carbonate formation, releasing CO2, may also reduce the benefits
of carbon storage by similar proportions (Howard et al. 2017;
Macreadie et al. 2017a; Kennedy et al. 2018; Saderne et al. 2019).

"Quantification of the climatic benefits of such actions is, however,
not straightforward. Measurements of carbon burial rates show high
site-specific variability, being strongly affected by a wide range of
environmental factors for mangroves (Adame et al. 2017; Schile et al.
2017), seagrasses (Lavery et al. 2013) and salt marshes (Kelleway
et al. 2017b). The reliable determination of sediment accumulation
rates is a key consideration, with associated uncertainties not fully
reflected in the McLeod et al. (2011) estimates given above. In
particular, geochemical-based studies have indicated that seagrass
carbon burial may have been greatly overestimated (Johannessen
and Macdonald, 2016). These issues are contentious (Johannessen
and Macdonald, 2018a; Johannessen and Macdonald, 2018b;
Macreadie et al. 2018; Oreska et al. 2018); their scientific resolution
is highly desirable. Additional complexities relating to the mitigation
role of coastal blue carbon ecosystems include the following:

"Lateral transfers are not well-quantified. Whilst some of the
carbon stored in coastal marine sediments may be recalcitrant
carbon from terrestrial or atmospheric sources (and should
therefore be excluded) (Chew and Gallagher, 2018), export of
dissolved organic carbon, inorganic carbon and alkalinity may be
considered as additional sequestration (Maher et al. 2018; Santos
et al. 2019).

The permanence of vegetated coastal systems, even if well-
protected, cannot be assumed under future temperature regimes
(Ward et al. 2016; Duke et al. 2017; Jennerjahn et al. 2017;
Nowicki et al. 2017).

Responses to future SLR are also uncertain and complex (Kirwan
and Megonigal, 2013; Spencer et al. 2016). However, impacts
are not necessarily negative: carbon sequestration capacity may

"At the global scale, synthesis studies have estimated the potential
additional sequestration achieved by cost effective coastal blue carbon
restoration as ~0.05 GtC yr“ (Griscom et al. 2017) and 0.04 GtC yr""
(National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2019),
assuming that a relatively high proportion of vegetated ecosystems
can be re-instated to their 1980-1990 extents. These values compare to
current net anthropogenic emissions from all sources of 10.0 GtC yr""
(Le Quéré et al. 2018), and are consistent with the ‘very low’ scores by
(Gattuso et al. 2018) for the climate mitigation benefits of conserving
and restoring coastal vegetation (Figure 5.23). Coastal ecosystem
restoration could theoretically achieve higher sequestration, around
~0.2 GtC yr! (Griscom et al. 2017), but would be challenging,
because of the semi-permanent and on-going nature of most coastal
land-use change, such as human settlement, conversion to agriculture
and aquaculture, shoreline hardening and port development (Gittman

complex processes that affect carbon storage in the potentially
mobile fraction of marine sediments (van de Velde et al. 2018);

These approaches are based on increasing the naturally-occurring
uptake of CO2 by carbonates (e.g., calcite and dolomite) or silicate
minerals (such as olivine). Such rock-weathering currently sequesters
~0.25 GtC yr"", on land and at sea (Taylor et al. 2015) and provides
the longterm control of atmospheric CO2 concentrations. It could be
enhanced by adding ground minerals to beaches (Montserrat et al.

be more cost-effective in flood protection than hard infrastructure

"Seaweeds do not directly transfer carbon to marine sediments, unlike
the rooted coastal vegetation considered above (Howard et al. 2017).
Nevertheless, seaweed detritus can deliver carbon to sedimentary
sites (Hill et al. 2015) and may provide a source of refractory dissolved
organic (Krause-Jensen and Duarte, 2016). Recent studies indicate
that globally important amounts of carbon may be involved in these
processes (Krause-Jensen and Duarte, 2016; Krause-Jensen et al.

that enhancement of natural seaweed production can provide

various natural environments (Taylor and Townsend, 2010) as well as

agricultural fertilisers and sewage discharge to coastal waters may
currently promote the microbial breakdown of river-derived terrestrial
dissolved organic carbon, reducing carbon storage (Liu et al. 2014).
Thus reducing nutrient inputs in the future may expand carbon storage
by favouring the microbial carbon pump, in addition to the multiple
co-benefits of reduced nutrient loads related to HABs, oxygenation
and ocean acidification (Miranda et al. 2013; Jiao et al. 2018a; Zhang

dissolved organic carbon variations on global scale climate (Rothman
et al. 2003) the benefits of this approach have yet to be determined
quantitatively and uncertainties remain regarding the longevity of
removal and associated carbon accounting (measurement, reporting
and verification). Until such issues are better resolved, there is low
confidence that stimulation of refractory dissolved organic carbon
production could provide an operational long-term mitigation measure.

pool of coral colonies (derived from coral nubbins and fragments,
and from sexually derived spat) are farmed in underwater nurseries,
preferably on mid-water floating devices installed in sheltered

being called for (Rinkevich, 1995; Rinkevich, 2000; Barton et al. 2017). Intervention strategies that are still at the ‘proof-of-concept’ stage,
include: ‘assisted colonisation’ — actively moving species that are confined to disappearing habitats (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2008;
Chauvenet et al. 2013); ‘assisted evolution’ — developing corals resistant to climate change via accelerated natural evolution processes
(van Oppen et al. 2015); assisted coral chimerism (Rinkevich, 2019); novel coral symbiont associations (Mcllroy and Coffroth, 2017); and
coral microbiome manipulation (Bourne et al. 2016; Sweet and Bulling, 2017; van Oppen et al. 2017b). In contrast, the ‘coral gardening’
approachs — coral farmed in nurseries and transplanted using a range of tactics to increase survivability, growth rates and reproduction
(Rinkevich, 2006; Rinkevich, 2014) — is already in use. Other interventions that have already been implemented in some coral reefs,
such as the use of artificial reefs (Ng et al. 2017) are limited in impacts, and all are also revealing considerable challenges (Rieg| et al. 2011;
Coles and Riegl, 2013; Ferrario et al. 2014).

restoration projects have resulted in maladaptive outcomes, in
which the resulting ecosystem degradation could not provide the
ecosystem services required (Nguyen et al. 2017; Romafiach et al.

processes or a lack of community compliance with restoration
plans. These examples emphasise the value of designing effective
governance to implement adaptation responses with broad
community participation to improve the climate risk reduction
outcomes and co-benefits (Sierra-Correa and Cantera Kintz, 2015;

coastal protection from extreme storm events (Section 5.4.1),
supporting services through increased sedimentation rates (Hayden

provide limited carbon mitigation, in terms of global emissions
reduction, and substantial job creation (Table 5.7) co-benefits (for
example through Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest
Degradation programmes) when managed properly (Section 5.4.1,

both mitigation (Section 5.5.1) and adaptation (Section 5.3.3.6) for coral reefs. Extensive research has explored adaptation measures
involving the cultivation and transplantation of corals; however, the literature contains limited evidence on the comprehensive analysis

"Many of the alternative interventions that aim to increase the climate resilience of coral reefs involve culturing, selectively breeding
and transplanting corals to enhance the adaptability of reef organisms to climate change, for example, by supporting the natural
poleward range expansion of corals (West et al. 2017; Vergés et al. 2019). Advances in reef restoration techniques have been made
in the last two decades (Rinkevich, 2014; Lirman and Schopmeyer, 2016), but assessments of the effectiveness of these techniques
have mostly focused on the short-term feasibility of the technique (Frias-Torres and van de Geer, 2015; Lirman and Schopmeyer, 2016;
Montoya Maya et al. 2016; Jacob et al. 2017; Rachmilovitz and Rinkevich, 2017), while longer-term evaluation in the context of all the
pillars of sustainable development (Section 5.4.2) is limited (Rinkevich, 2015b; Barton et al. 2017; Flores et al. 2017; Hein et al. 2017).
These alternative interventions, primarily the coral gardening approach, face two challenges. The first is scaling up; currently, these
interventions have been tested at scales of hundreds of meters, while application at larger scale is lacking (Rinkevich, 2014). The second
challenge (Box 5.5, Figure 1) is the effectiveness of active reef restoration to mitigate or rehabilitate global change impacts (Shaish et al.
2010a; Schopmeyer et al. 2012; Coles and Rieg|, 2013; Hernandez-Delgado et al. 2014; Rinkevich, 2015a; Wilson and Forsyth, 2018) and

incorporating local knowledge and Indigenous knowledge and

Sanchez-Arcilla et al. 2016; van der Nat et al. 2016). The application
of synergistic combinations of adaptation responses in multiple
ecosystems can provide a range of co-benefits, and this approach
is strengthened when combined with socioinstitutional approaches
(Kochnower et al. 2015; MacDonald et al. 2017). Research to improve
and refine EbA approaches and increase their specificity to local
context is important for their effectiveness in reducing climate risks
and generating co-benefits (Sutton-Grier et al. 2015). Conversely,
a lack of inclusion of local communities and economic undervaluation
of specific coastal and marine ecosystems, compounded by gaps in

of combining hard and soft infrastructure measures, and challenges
with sourcing sediment for beach replenishment. In some cases dune
restoration and sand replenishment projects have not been successful,
due to fire damage (Shumack and Hesse, 2017) or the rapid loss of
sand within replenishment schemes due to coastal processes and

indeed in most other sectors, despite consensus on the importance

adaptation progress may be hampered by competing economic
interests and worldviews (Hamilton and Safford, 2015), which can be
compounded by limited climate change knowledge (Nanlohy et al.

factors like access to alternative income, mobility, gender and religion
collectively shape a community's adaptation response (Arroyo Mina

change induced reductions in landings was the expansion of fishing
grounds, which increased operational costs (Belhabib et al. 2016). This
response is not available to artisanal and local fishing communities,
who are considered highly vulnerable (Kais and Islam, 2017). Access
to finance to support these communities or their governments could
help them reach novel fishing grounds, and, therefore, potentially
reduce their vulnerability. Food security linked to fisheries depends on
stock recovery, but also on access to and distribution of the harvest,
as well as gender considerations (Béné et al. 2015). Hence, granting
preferential access to dependent coastal communities should be
considered in examining policy options. Other adaptation responses
include improved fishing gear and technology, use of fish aggregating

(Miller et al. 2017), public lack of knowledge on climate change
and distrust of information sources (Wynveen and Sutton, 2015), as
well as populations increasingly distanced from, and unconcerned
about nature (Romafiach et al. 2018), may constrain ecosystem-
based adaptation response. Examples of governance adaptation
constraints include: inadequate policy, governance and institutional
structures (Sanchez-Arcilla et al. 2016; Miller et al. 2017; Wigand
et al. 2017), limited capacity (Sutton-Grier et al. 2015; Thorne et al.
2017), ineffective implementation (Nguyen et al. 2017; Comte and
Pendleton, 2018), and poor enforcement (Nguyen et al. 2017).
Governance constraints are compounded by lack of finances (Miller
et al. 2017), financial costs of design and implementation (Gallagher
et al. 2015) and the high cost of coastal land (Gracia et al. 2018),
although ecosystem-based adaptation is considered cheaper than
human-made structures (Nehren et al. 2017; Salgado and Martinez,

exceed the adaptive capacity of ecosystems, for example, SLR may
outpace the vertical reef accretion rate (Beetham et al. 2017; Elliff

adaptation is that tools have not yet been developed for large-scale
implementation (van Oppen et al. 2017a). Ecosystems may also have
physiological and ecological constraints which are exceeded by
climate change impacts (Miller et al. 2017; Wigand et al. 2017), and
the recovery periods of natural systems (Gracia et al. 2018) and for
ecological succession (Salgado and Martinez, 2017) may be outpaced
by climate change impacts. The performance of ecosystems in EBA

institutional capacity within local government organisations, whose

Major Issues and Actions

UNCLOS imposes obligations on state parties to take action to combat the main sources of ocean pollutic
techniques in UNCLOS may need adjustment in response to the emerging challenges created by ocean cli
(Redgwell, 2012). However, success of the umbrella regulatory framework of UNCLOS depends heavily on
development, modification and implementation of detailed regulations by relevant international, regional ar
institutions (Karim, 2015).

The London Protocol to the London Convention was amended in 2006 to address the issue of carbon dio»
processes for sequestration. Two subsequent amendments concern sharing transboundary sub-seabed g
formations for sequestration projects, and ocean fertilisation and other marine geoengineering. One of t
amendments prohibits ocean fertilisation except for research purposes (Dixon et al. 2014).

The issue of ocean acidification has been considered within the framework of the OSPAR Convention, the
Convention (Herr et al. 2014), and the CBD (CBD,2014) ; this issue is discussed further in Box 5.6.

The CBD has also considered regulatory issues relating to ocean fertilisation and other (marine) geoeni
(Williamson and Bodle, 2016). In 2018, the CBD adopted Voluntary Guidelines for the Design and Effective |
of Ecosystem-Based Approaches to Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Reduction. However, even
Convention choose to adopt the voluntary guidelines, there is no mechanism to implement them beyond the
economic zones in the water column and their extended continental shelves (if recognised) in the seabed.

Climate Change

Existing international legal instruments do not adequately address climate change challenges for the op
coastal seas (Galland et al. 2012; Redgwell, 2012; Herr et al. 2014; Magnan et al. 2016; Gallo et al. 2017
Nevertheless, ocean and coastal areas will benefit from the overall UNFCCC goal for preventing danger
with the climate system. A study of the 161 national pledges for climate change mitigation and adaptation (
“gaps between scientific [understanding] and government attention, including on ocean deoxygenation, whi
mentioned’ (Gallo et al. 2017).

In 2011, the MARPOL convention was amended to include technical and operational measures for the re¢
of greenhouse gas emissions from ships. However, the effectiveness of these provisions depends on the n
implementation by flag, port and coastal states, with no international enforcement authority (Karim, 201!

The impact of climate change on marine fisheries is expected to be very significant (Sections 5.3, 5.4) (Barar
FAO, 2019), with adverse impacts on food security, livelihood and national development in many coastal.
developed countries seem particularly vulnerable (Blasiak et al. 2017). Regional fisheries management s
address these emerging challenges (Brooks et al. 2013). The ecological and socio-ecological criteria ani
performance can be set at regional levels where Regional Fisheries Management Organizations have been e
their effectiveness is variable depending on the characteristics of regulatory instruments and other factors ((
The current international regulatory framework for fisheries management has a responsiveness gap, since |
incorporate issues related to the fluctuating and changing distribution of fisheries (Pentz and Klenk, 2017; P

However, some regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs) have initiated processes to improv
sharing fishery resources affected by climate change (Aqorau et al. 2018). A climate-informed ecosystem-
governance approach has been suggested for enhancing climate change resilience of marine fisheries in
world (Heenan et al. 2015), but robust and effective management, policy, legislation and planning based
scientific understanding will be required for coastal fisheries (Gourlie et al. 2017). The existing failing con
stocks, coupled with maladaptive responses to climate change, may create serious challenges for the sust
global fisheries; improved fisheries governance can offset some of these challenges (Gaines et al. 2018).

The fisheries agreements and the provisions in UNCLOS have helped RFMOs to increase the sustainability «
on stocks in or migrating through international waters, and equity of access to them. Because the distribut
stocks changes with changes in physical oceanic conditions (particularly temperature and current regimes)
measures and access arrangements negotiated and adopted by the RFMOs have reduced effectiveness
climate. New arrangements have been difficult to negotiate, in part because of concerns that the distri

productivities will continue to change as climate change continues to drive changes on ocean conditions (

"One possible response to the fragmented responsibilities for ocean acidification governance would be the development of a new
UN mechanism specifically to address ocean acidification (Kim, 2012). This option would take time and political will, and has not
been widely supported (Harrould-Kolieb and Herr, 2012). One pragmatic approach could be enhancing the involvement of UNFCCC
with acidification governance (Herr et al. 2014) together with increased use of multilateral environment agreements (Harrould-Kolieb and

adaptations of governance are being tried, and some are producing
promising results (Sections 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4). However, rigorous
further evaluation is needed regarding the effectiveness of these
adaptations in achieving their goals in addressing specific governance
challenges. Robust conclusions on the effectiveness of specific types
of governance adaptations in various socio-ecological contexts would
require a targeted assessment of ocean (and terrestrial) governance in
a changing climate, possible as a key part of AR6.

"Adaptation to climate change could also include a more integrated approach to reduce ocean acidification impacts (Section 5.5.2).
Proposed adaptation actions for ocean acidification (Kelly et al. 2011; Billé et al. 2013; Strong et al. 2014; Albright et al. 2016a) include
reduction of pollution and other stressors (thereby strengthening resilience); water treatment (e.g., for high value aquaculture); and the
use of seaweed cultivation and seagrass restoration to slow longterm pH changes (although short-term variability may be increased)
(Sabine, 2018). These measures are generally applicable to relatively limited spatial scales; whilst they may succeed in ‘buying time’, their
future effectiveness will decrease unless underlying global drivers are also addressed (high confidence).

"Although many bodies have interests in ocean acidification, no unifying treaty or single instrument has been developed (Herr et al.
2014; Harrould-Kolieb and Hoegh-Guldberg, 2019) and there has been only limited governance action that is specific to the problem
(Fennel and VanderZwaag, 2016; Jagers et al. 2018). Exceptions to this generalisation are the development of coordinated monitoring
through the Global Ocean Acidification Observing Network (Newton et al. 2015), with associated scientific support through the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) (Osborn et al. 2017; Watson-Wright and Valdés, 2018); and SDG14.3, with its non-binding,

it featured strongly in AR5, being covered by both WGI and WGIl; its impacts are assessed in many sections of this Chapter; and
concerns regarding ocean acidification have been raised through many international governance structures, including the United

changes in the open ocean, deep sea and coasts. It draws on

Change is observed across physical conditions that pose hazards
to ecosystems in all regions from the surface to the deepest parts

impacts but also some positive, some very significantly, some less

impacts on human systems and ecosystem services are shown. For physical changes, yellow/green refers to an increase/decrease, respectively, in amount or frequency of the
measured variable. For impacts on ecosystems, human systems and ecosystems services blue or red depicts whether an observed impact is positive (beneficial) or negative
(adverse), respectively, to the given system or service. Cells assigned ‘increase and decrease’ indicate that within that region, both increases and decreases of physical
changes are found, but are not necessarily equal; the same holds for cells showing ‘positive and negative’ attributable impacts. For ocean regions, the confidence level
refers to the confidence in attributing observed changes to changes in greenhouse gas forcing for physical changes and to climate change for ecosystem, human systems,
and ecosystem services. No assessment means: not applicable, not assessed at regional scale, or the evidence is insufficient for assessment. The physical changes in the
ocean are defined as: Temperature change in 0-700 m layer of the ocean except for Southern Ocean (0—2000 m) and Arctic Ocean (upper mixed layer and major inflowing
branches); Oxygen in the 0O-1200 m layer or oxygen minimum layer; Ocean pH as surface pH (decreasing pH corresponds to increasing ocean acidification). Ecosystems
in the ocean: Coral refers to warm-water coral reefs and cold-water corals. The ‘upper water column’ category refers to epipelagic zone for all ocean regions except Polar
Regions, where the impacts on some pelagic organisms in open water deeper than the upper 200 m were included. Coastal wetland includes salt marshes, mangroves
and seagrasses. Kelp forests are habitats of a specific group of macroalgae. Rocky shores are coastal habitats dominated by immobile calcified organisms such as mussels
and barnacles. Deep sea is seafloor ecosystems that are 3000-6000 m deep. Sea-ice associated includes ecosystems in, on and below sea ice. Habitat services refer to
supporting structures and services (e.g., habitat, biodiversity, primary production). Coastal Carbon Sequestration refers to the uptake and storage of carbon by coastal blue
carbon ecosystems. Impacts on tourism refer to the operating conditions for the tourism sector. Cultural services include cultural identity, sense of home, and spiritual and

the deep sea. A partial solution would be establishing an appropriate
ocean and coasts database, including costs-benefits, for these types
of studies.

"Risk-reduction responses and their governance through adaptation
at the local scale are the most common responses to climate change
from ocean systems (Section 5.5.2). It is clear that there are many
choices for reducing risk of climate change. Many of the actions
have benefits and relatively few dis-benefits, while others have large
dis-benefits and marginal effectiveness (Section 5.5.1, Figure 5.23,
Table 5.7 and Table 5.8). Many of the risk reduction approaches are
limited in their capacity to reduce the risks of climate change, or are at
best temporary solutions, which is a significant challenge to adapting
to climate change (high confidence). In particular, the effectiveness
of the assessed risk reduction measures are minimal under high
greenhouse gas emission scenarios, highlighting the critical
importance of mitigation. The assessment points to the increased
effectiveness and importance of a portfolio of different types of
mitigation and adaptation options. Governance is also a critical
element in the portfolio of options and occurs at local, national and
international scales. Such responses can be more effective with the
support of scientific information, Local knowledge and Indigenous
knowledge, and the consideration of local context and the inclusion
of stakeholders.

"FAQ5.1, Figure 1 | Summary schematic of the impacts and resulting consequences of climate change (warming, acidification, storminess and deoxygenation)
and other human impacts, on coral reefs, polar seas and fisheries, discussed in this FAQ.
"	Text
"Climate change poses a serious threat to life in our seas, including coral reefs and fisheries, with impacts on
marine ecosystems, economies and societies, especially those most dependent upon natural resources. The risk
posed by climate change can be reduced by limiting global warming to no more than 1.5°C.
"	Text
"Life in most of the global ocean, from pole to pole and from sea surface to the abyssal depths, is already
experiencing higher temperatures due to human-driven climate change. In many places, that increase may be
barely measurable. In others, particularly in near-surface waters, warming has already had dramatic impacts
on marine animals, plants and microbes. Due to closely linked changes in seawater chemistry, less oxygen
remains available (in a process called ocean deoxygenation). Seawater contains more dissolved carbon dioxide,
causing ocean acidification. Non-climatic effects of human activities are also ubiquitous, including over-fishing
and pollution. Whilst these stressors and their combined effects are likely to be harmful to almost all marine
organisms, food-webs and ecosystems, some are at greater risk (FAQ5.1, Figure 1). The consequences for human
society can be serious unless sufficient action is taken to constrain future climate change.
"	Text
"Warm water coral reefs host a wide variety of marine life and are very important for tropical fisheries and other
marine and human systems. They are particularly vulnerable, since they can suffer high mortalities when water
temperatures persist above a threshold of between 1°C-2°C above the normal range. Such conditions occurred
in many tropical seas between 2015 and 2017 and resulted in extensive coral bleaching, when the coral animal
hosts ejected the algal partners upon which they depend. After mass coral mortalities due to bleaching, reef
recovery typically takes at least 10-15 years. Other impacts of climate change include SLR, acidification and reef
erosion. Whilst some coral species are more resilient than others, and impacts vary between regions, further reef
degradation due to future climate change now seems inevitable, with serious consequences for other marine
and coastal ecosystems, like loss of coastal protection for many islands and low-lying areas and loss of the high
biodiversity these reefs host. Coral habitats can also occur in deeper waters and cooler seas, and more research is
needed to understand impacts in these reefs. Although these cold water corals are not at risk from bleaching, due
to their cooler environment, they may weaken or dissolve under ocean acidification, and other ocean changes.

"Whilst some climate change impacts (like possible increased catch levels in polar regions) may benefit humans,
most will be disruptive for ecosystems, economies and societies, especially those that are highly dependent upon

natural resources. However, the impacts of climate change can be much reduced if the world as a whole, through
inter-governmental interventions, manages to limit global warming to no more than 1.5°C.
"	Text
"In polar seas, species adapted to life on or under sea ice are directly threatened by habitat loss due to climate
change. The Arctic and Southern Oceans are home to a rich diversity of life, from tiny plankton to fish, krill and
seafloor invertebrates to whales, seals, polar bears or penguins. Their complex interactions may be altered if
new warmer-water species extend their ranges as sea temperatures rise. The effects of acidification on shelled
organisms, as well as increased human activities (e.g., shipping) in ice-free waters, can amplify these disruptions.
"	Text
"Mobile species, such as fish, may respond to climate change by moving to more favorable regions, with populations
shifting poleward or to deeper water, to find their preferred range of water temperatures or oxygen levels. As
a result, projections of total future fishery yields under different climate change scenarios only show a moderate
decrease of around 4% (~3.4 million tonnes) per degree Celsius warming. However, there are dramatic regional
variations. With high levels of climate change, fisheries in tropical regions could lose up to half of their current
catch levels by the end of this century. Polar catch levels may increase slightly, although the extent of such gains
is uncertain, because fish populations that are currently depleted by overfishing and subject to other stressors
may not be capable of migrating to polar regions, as assumed in models.

"Climate change is modifying multiple types of climate-related
events or hazards in terms of occurrence, intensity and
periodicity. It increases the likelihood of compound hazards
that comprise simultaneously or sequentially occurring events
to cause extreme impacts in natural and human systems.
Compound events in turn trigger cascading impacts (high

"Observations, both in situ (2004-2017) and based on sea
surface temperature reconstructions, indicate that the Atlantic
Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) has weakened
relative to 1850-1900 (medium confidence). There is insufficient
data to quantify the magnitude of the weakening, or to properly
attribute it to anthropogenic forcing due to the limited length of the
observational record. Although attribution is currently not possible,
CMIP5 model simulations of the period 1850-2015, on average,
exhibit a weakening AMOC when driven by anthropogenic forcing.

"The equatorial Pacific trade wind system experienced an
unprecedented intensification during 2001-2014, resulting in
enhanced ocean heat transport from the Pacific to the Indian
Ocean, influencing the rate of global temperature change
(medium confidence). In the last two decades, total water transport
from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean by the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF),
and the Indian Ocean to Atlantic Ocean has increased (high confidence).
Increased ITF has been linked to Pacific cooling trends and basin-wide
warming trends in the Indian Ocean. Pacific sea surface temperature
(SST) cooling trends and strengthened trade winds have been linked to
an anomalously warm tropical Atlantic. {6.6, Figure 6.7}

"Both palaeoclimate and modern observations suggest that the
strongest El Nifio and La Nifia events since the pre-industrial

Nifio events during the modern observational period (1982-1983,
1997-1998, 2015-2016), all characterised by pronounced rainfall
in the normally dry equatorial East Pacific. There have been two
occurrences of extreme La Nifia (1988-1989, 1998-1999). El

"Marine heatwaves (MHWs), periods of extremely high ocean
temperatures, have negatively impacted marine organisms
and ecosystems in all ocean basins over the last two decades,
including critical foundation species such as corals, seagrasses
and kelps (very high confidence). Globally, marine heat related
events have increased; marine heatwaves, defined when the daily sea
surface temperature exceeds the local 99th percentile over the period
1982 to 2016, have doubled in frequency and have become longer-
lasting, more intense and more extensive (very likely). It is very likely
that between 84-90% of marine heatwaves that occurred between
2006 and 2015 are attributable to the anthropogenic temperature
increase. {6.4, Figures 6.3, 6.4}

"For TCs and ETCs, investment in disaster risk reduction, flood

such investments may be hindered by limited local capacities,
such as increased losses and mortality from extreme winds and
storm surges in less developed countries despite adaptation
efforts. There is emerging evidence of increasing risks for locations
impacted by unprecedented storm trajectories (low confidence).
Managing the risk from such changing storm trajectories and intensity
proves challenging because of the difficulties of early warning and its
receptivity by the affected population (high confidence). {6.3, 6.9}

"The AMOC will very likely weaken over the 21st century (high
confidence), although a collapse is very unlikely (medium

AMOC remains a physically plausible scenario. Such a weakening
would strongly impact natural and human systems, leading to
a decrease in marine productivity in the North Atlantic, more winter
storms in Europe, a reduction in Sahelian and South Asian summer
rainfall, a decrease in the number of TCs in the Atlantic, and an increase
in regional sea level around the Atlantic especially along the northeast
coast of North America (medium confidence). Such impacts would be
superimposed on the global warming signal. {6.7, Figure 6.8}

"The average intensity of tropical cyclones, the proportion
of Category 4 and 5 tropical cyclones and the associated
average precipitation rates are projected to increase for a 2°C
global temperature rise above any baseline period (medium

extreme sea levels associated with tropical cyclones (very high

the average intensity, magnitude of storm surge and precipitation
rates of tropical cyclones. There are greater increases projected

the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate, to identify regional
hot spots, cascading effects, their impacts on human and natural
systems, and sustainable and resilient risk management strategies.
While not comprehensive in terms of discussing all such phenomena,
it addresses a number of issues that are prominent in both the
policy area and in the scientific literature. Further information may
also be found in Chapters 2 to 4 for other aspects of the ocean
and cryosphere.

"Figure 6.1 | Framework used in this chapter (see discussion in Chapter 1). Singular or multiple climate drivers can lead to extreme hazards and associated cascading
impacts, which combined with non-climatic drivers affect exposure and vulnerability, leading to compound risks. Extremes discussed are tropical cyclones (TCs) and
extratropical cyclones (ETCs) and associated sea surface dynamics (Section 6.3); marine heatwaves (MHWs) (Section 6.4), extreme El Nifio and La Nifia events (Section 6.5);
and extreme oceanic decadal variability (Section 6.6). Examples of abrupt events, irreversibility and tipping points discussed are the Atlantic Meridional Overturning
Circulation (AMOC) and subpolar gyre (SPG) system (Section 6.7). Section 6.2 also collects examples of such events from the rest of the Special Report on the Oceans and
Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) and compiles examples of events whose occurrence or severity has been linked to climate change. Cascading impacts and
compound events are discussed in Section 6.8 and three examples are given in Box 6.1. Section 6.9 discusses risk management, climate resilience pathways, transformative
governance adaptation and mitigation required to address societal and environmental risks.

"Irreversibility: A perturbed state of a dynamical system is defined
as irreversible on a given timescale, if the recovery timescale from
this state due to natural processes is significantly longer than the
time it takes for the system to reach this perturbed state. In the
context of this report, the recovery time scale of interest is hundreds
to thousands of years.
"	Text
"Cascading impacts from extreme weather/climate events occur
when an extreme hazard generates a sequence of secondary events
in natural and human systems that result in physical, natural, social
or economic disruption, whereby the resulting impact is significantly
larger than the initial impact. Cascading impacts are complex and
multi-dimensional, and are associated more with the magnitude of
vulnerability than with that of the hazard.
"	Text
"Tipping point: A level of change in system properties beyond which
a system reorganises, often in a nonlinear manner, and does not
return to the initial state even if the drivers of the change are abated.
For the climate system, the term refers to a critical threshold when
global or regional climate changes from one stable state to another
stable state. Tipping points are also used when referring to impact;
the term can imply that an impact tipping point is (about to be)
reached in a natural or human system.

"Extreme weather/climate event: An extreme event is an event
that is rare at a particular place and time of year. Definitions of ‘rare’
vary, but an extreme event would normally be as rare as or rarer
than the 10th or 90th percentile of a probability density function
estimated from observations. By definition, the characteristics of
what is called an extreme event may vary from place to place in
an absolute sense. When a pattern of extreme weather persists for
some time, such as a season, it may be classed as an extreme climate
event, especially if it yields an average or total that is itself extreme
(e.g., high temperature, drought, or total rainfall over a season).

"6.2.2 Recent Anomalous Extreme Climate
Events and their Causes
"	Title
"The attribution of changes in the observed statistics of extremes are
generally addressed using well-established detection-attribution
methods. In contrast, record-breaking weather and climate
events are by definition unique, and can be expected to occur
with or without climate change as the observed record lengthens.
Therefore, event attribution begins with the premise that the
climate is changing, the goal being to determine statistically how
much climate change has contributed to the severity of the event
(Trenberth et al. 2015; Shepherd, 2016). Annual reports dedicated to
extreme event attribution (Peterson et al. 2012; Peterson et al. 2013;
Herring et al. 2014; Herring et al. 2015; Herring et al. 2018) have helped
stimulate studies that adopt recognised methods for extreme event
attribution. The increasing pool of studies allows different approaches

"to be contrasted and builds consensus on the role of climate change
when individual climate events are studied by multiple teams using
different methods. A number of these events are summarised in
Table 6.2 and Figure 6.2. Collectively, these studies show that the
role of climate change in the ocean and cryosphere extreme events
is increasingly driving extreme climate and weather events across
the globe including compound events (high confidence). Some
regions including Africa and the Pacific have had relatively fewer
event attribution studies undertaken, possibly reflecting the lack of
capacity by regional and national technical institutions. A caveat of
this approach is that there is a potential for ‘null results’, that is,
cases where attribution is not possible, to be reported. Nevertheless,
there is no evidence that this is the case, and the number of recent
studies and wide range of phenomena addressed suggests increasing
influence of climate change on extreme events.

a positive contribution from anthropogenic forcing (Bhatia et al. 2019).

"Kossin et al. (2014) identified a poleward expansion of the latitudes
of maximum TC intensity in recent decades, which has been linked to
an anthropogenically-forced tropical expansion (Sharmila and Walsh,
2018) and a continued poleward shift of cyclones projected over the
western North Pacific in a warmer climate (Kossin et al. 2016). A 10%
slowdown in translation speed of TCs over the 1949-2016 period has
been linked to the weakening of the tropical summertime circulation
associated with tropical expansion and a more pronounced slowdown
in the range 16-22% was found over land areas affected by TCs in the
western North Pacific, North Atlantic and Australian regions (Kossin,

"Further studies have investigated the dynamics of TCs. A modelling
study investigated a series of low-frequency increases and decreases
in TC activity over the North Atlantic over the 20th century
(Dunstone et al. 2013). These variations, culminating in a recent
rise in activity, are thought to be due in part to atmospheric aerosol
forcing variations (aerosol forcing), which exerts a cooling effect
(Booth et al. 2012; Dunstone et al. 2013). However, the relative
importance of internal variability vs. radiative forcing for multidecadal
variability in the Atlantic basin, including TC variability, remains
uncertain (Weinkle et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2013; Vecchi et al. 2017;
Yan et al., 2017). Although the aerosol cooling effect has largely
cancelled the increases in potential intensity over the observational
period, according to Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5
(CMIP5) model historical runs, further anthropogenic warming in the
future is expected to dominate the aerosol cooling effect leading to
increasing TC intensities (Sobel et al. 2016).

"TCs amplify wave heights along the tracks of rapidly moving cyclones
(eg., Moon et al. 2015a) and can therefore increase mixing to the
surface of cooler subsurface water. Several studies found that TCs
reduce the projected thermal stratification of the upper ocean in
CMIP5 models under global warming, thereby slightly offsetting the
simulated TC-intensity increases under climate warming conditions
(Emanuel, 2015; Huang et al. 2015b; Tuleya et al. 2016). On the other
hand, freshening of the upper ocean by TC rainfall enhances density
stratification by reducing near-surface salinity and this reduces the
ability of TC’s to cool the upper ocean, thereby having an influence
opposite to the thermal stratification effect (Balaguru et al. 2015). In
the late 21st century, increased salinity stratification was found to offset
about 50% of the suppressive effects that TC mixing has on temperature
stratification (Balaguru et al. 2015). Coupled ocean-atmosphere models
still robustly project an increase of TC intensity with climate warming, and
particularly for new TC-permitting coupled climate model simulations
that compute internally consistent estimates of thermal stratification
change (e.g., Kim et al. 2014a; Bhatia et al. 2018). Higher TC intensities
in turn may further aggravate the impacts of SLR on TC-related coastal
inundation extremes (Timmermans et al. 2017).

increase by at least 7% per degree Celsius SST warming, owing to
higher atmospheric water vapour content, 2) there is low confidence
(low agreement, medium evidence) in how global TC frequency will

"ETCs form in the mid-latitudes of the North Atlantic, North Pacific
and Southern Oceans, and the Mediterranean Sea. The storm
track regions are characterised by large surface equator-to-pole
temperature gradients and baroclinic instability, and jet streams
influence the direction and speed of movement of ETCs in this region.
The thermodynamic response of the atmosphere to CO2 tends to
have opposing influences on storm tracks; surface shortwave cloud
radiative changes increase the equator-to-pole temperature gradient
whereas longwave cloud radiative changes reduce it (Shaw et al.
2016). AR5 concluded that the global number of ETCs is not expected
to decrease by more than a few percent due to anthropogenic
change. The Southern Hemisphere (SH) storm track is projected to
have a small poleward shift, but the magnitude is model dependent

storm occurrence in the central North Pacific. There have been new
studies on storm size (Kim et al. 2014a; Knutson et al. 2015; Yamada

preliminary findings on this issue that future studies will continue
to investigate. Several studies of TC storm surge (e.g., Lin et al. 2012;
Garner et al. 2017) suggest that SLR will dominate the increased

"Taking the above into account, the following is a summary assessment
of TC detection and attribution. The observed poleward migration
of the latitude of maximum TC intensity in the western North
Pacific appears to be unusual compared to expected natural
variability and therefore there is low to medium confidence that
this change represents a detectable climate change, though with
only low confidence that the observed shift has a discernible
positive contribution from anthropogenic forcing. Anthropogenic
forcing is believed to be producing some poleward expansion of
the tropical circulation with climate warming. Additional studies
of observed long-term TC changes such as: an increase in annual
global proportion of Category 4 or 5 TCs in recent decades, severe
TCs occurring in the Arabian Sea, TCs making landfall in East and
Southeast Asia, the increasing frequency of moderately large US
storm surge events since 1923 and the decreasing frequency of
severe TCs that make landfall in eastern Australia since the late
1800s, may each represent emerging anthropogenic signals, but still
with low confidence (limited evidence). The lack of confident climate
change detection for most TC metrics continues to limit confidence
in both future projections and in the attribution of past changes and
TC events, since TC event attribution in most published studies is
generally being inferred without support from a confident climate
change detection of a long-term trend in TC activity.

"A ‘blocking’ event is an extratropical weather system in which the
anticyclone (region of high pressure) becomes quasi-stationary
and interrupts the usual westerly flow and/or storm tracks for up
to a week or more (Woollings et al. 2018). Recent attention has
focused on whether Arctic warming is linked to increased blocking
and mid-latitude weather extremes (Barnes and Screen, 2015; Francis
and Skific, 2015; Francis and Vavrus, 2015; Kretschmer et al. 2016),
such as drought in California due to sea ice changes that cause
a reorganisation of tropical convection (Cvijanovic et al. 2017), cold
and snowy winters over Europe and North America (Liu et al. 2012;
Cohen et al. 2018), extreme summer weather (Tang et al. 2013;
Coumou et al. 2014) and Balkan flooding (Stadtherr et al. 2016).
Studies suggest how blocking may influence arctic sea ice extent
(Gong and Luo, 2017) and various pathways whereby Arctic warming
could influence extreme weather (Barnes and Screen, 2015) such as
reducing the equator to pole temperature gradient, slowing the jet
stream thereby increasing its meandering behaviour (Rothlisberger
et al. 2016; Mann et al. 2017) or causing it to split (Coumou et al.
2014), changing local dynamics in the vicinity of the sea ice edge
(Screen and Simmonds, 2013) or weakening the stratospheric
polar vortex (Cohen et al. 2014). However, sensitivity to choice of
methodology (Screen and Simmonds, 2013) and large internal
atmospheric variability masks the detection of such links in past
records, and climate change can lead to opposing effects on the mid-
latitude jet stream response leading to large uncertainty in future
changes (Barnes and Polvani, 2015; Barnes and Screen, 2015).

"temperature differences in the upper and lower troposphere in the
future climate across a multi-model ensemble are well correlated
with a general strengthening of the storm track. The total number
of ETCs in a CMIP5 GCM multi-model ensemble decreased in the
future climate, whereas the number of strong ETCs increased in most
models and in the ensemble mean (Grieger et al. 2014). This was
associated with a general poleward shift related to both tropical
upper tropospheric warming and shifting meridional SST gradients in
the Southern Ocean. The poleward movement of baroclinic instability
and associated storm formation over the observational period due to
external radiative forcing, is projected to continue, with associated
declining rainfall trends in the mid-latitudes and positive trends
further polewards (Frederiksen et al. 2017).

"Significant developments have taken place since the ARS to model
storm surges and tides at the global scale. An unstructured global
hydrodynamic modelling system has been developed with maximum
coastal resolution of 5 km (Verlaan et al. 2015) and used to develop
a global climatology of ESLs due to the combination of storm surge and
tide (Muis et al. 2016). A global modelling study finds that under SLR
of 0.5-10 m, changes to astronomical tidal mean high water exceed
the imposed SLR by 10% or more at around 10% of coastal cities
when coastlines are held fixed. When coastal recession is permitted
a reduction in tidal range occurs due to changes in the period of
oscillation of the basin under the changed coastline morphology
(Pickering et al. 2017). A recent study on global probabilistic
projections of ESLs considering MSL, tides, wind-waves and storm
surges shows that under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, the global average
100-year ESL is very likely to increase by 34-76 cm and 58-172 cm,

"AR5 also concluded that there is medium confidence that mean
significant wave height has increased in the North Atlantic north of
45°N based on ship observations and reanalysis-forced wave model
hindcasts. ESL events have increased since 1970, mainly due to a rise
in mean sea levels (MSLs) over this period (Rhein et al. 2013). There
is medium confidence that mid-latitude jets will move 1-2 degrees
further poleward by the end of the 21st century under RCP8.5 in both
hemispheres with weaker shifts in the NH. In the SH during austral
summer, the poleward movement of the mid-latitude westerlies under
climate change is projected to be partially offset by stratospheric
ozone recovery. There is /ow confidence in projections of NH storm
tracks particularly in the North Atlantic. Tropical expansion is likely
to continue causing wider tropical regions and poleward movement
of the subtropical dry zones (Collins et al. 2013). In the SH, it is likely
that enhanced wind speeds will cause an increase in annual mean
significant wave heights. Wave swells generated in the Southern
Ocean may also affect wave heights, periods and directions in
adjacent ocean basins. The projected reduction in sea ice extent in
the Arctic Ocean (Holland et al. 2006) will increase wave heights and
wave season length (Church et al. 2013).

"The results of several new global wave climate projection studies
are consistent with those presented in IPCC ARS. Mentaschi et al.
(2017) find up to a 30% increase in 100-year return level wave
energy flux (the rate of transfer of wave energy) for the majority
of coastal areas in the southern temperate zone, and a projected
decrease in wave energy flux for most NH coastal areas at the end of
the century in wave model simulations forced by six CMIP5 RCP8.5
simulations. The most significant long-term trends in extreme wave
energy flux are explained by their relationship to modelled climate
indices (Arctic Oscillation, ENSO and NAO). Wang et al. (2014b)
assessed the climate change signal and uncertainty in a 20-member
ensemble of wave height simulations, and found model uncertainty
(inter-model variability) is significant globally, being about 10 times
as large as the variability between RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios.

in wave climate with spatial variation of SSTs in the tropical Pacific
Ocean. A review of 91 published global and regional scale wind-wave
climate projection studies found a consensus on a projected increase
in significant wave height over the Southern Ocean, tropical eastern
Pacific (high confidence) and Baltic Sea (medium confidence), and
decrease over the North Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. They found
little agreement between studies of projected changes over the
Atlantic Ocean, southern Indian and eastern North Pacific Ocean and
no regional agreement of projected changes to extreme wave height.
It was noted that few studies focussed on wave direction change,
which is important for shoreline response (Morim et al. 2018).

develop ESL projections for Europe that account for changes in waves
and storm surge. In 2100, increases of up to 0.35 m relative to the
SLR projections occur towards the end of the century under RCP8.5

"As shown in previous assessments, increasing exposure is a major
driver of increased cyclone risk (wind damages), as well as flood
risk associated with cyclone rainfall and surge, besides possible
changes in hazard intensities from anthropogenic climate change
(Handmer et al. 2012; Arent et al. 2014). Changes in TC trajectories
are potentially a major source of increased risk, as the degree of
vulnerability is typically much higher in locations that were previously
not exposed to the hazard (Noy, 2016). Typhoon Haiyan’s move to
the south of the usual trajectories of TCs in the western North Pacific
basin (Yonson et al. 2018) made the evacuation more difficult as
people were less willing to heed storm surge warnings they received.

surge models, and probabilistic SLR projections to assess flood hazard
associated with changing storm characteristics and SLR in New York City
from the pre-industrial era to 2300. Increased storm intensity was found
to compensate for offshore shifts in storm tracks leading to minimal
change in modelled storm surge heights through 2300. However,
projected SLR leads to large increases in future overall flood heights
associated with TCs in New York City. Consequently, flood height return
periods that were ~500y (0.2% probability of occurring in a given
year) during the pre-industrial era have fallen to ~25y (4% probability
of occurring annually) at present and are projected to fall to ~5y
(20% probability of occurring annually) within the next three decades.

"Abrupt changes in impacts therefore are not only determined by
changes in cyclone hazard, but also by the sensitivity or tipping
points that are crossed in terms of flooding for instance, that
can be driven by SLR but also by changes in local exposure. The
frequency of nuisance flooding along the US east coast is expected
to accelerate further in the future (Sweet and Park, 2014). The loss
of coral reef cover and mangrove forests have also been shown to
increase damages from storm surge events (e.g., Beck et al. 2018).
Cyclones also affect marine life, habitats and fishing. There is some
evidence that fish may evacuate storm areas or be redistributed by
storm waves and currents (FAO, 2018; Sainsbury et al. 2018). Other
examples of damage to fisheries from cyclones and storm surges can
be found in FAO (2018: Chapter V, Table 1).

knowledge on projected wave period and direction. For coastal ESLs,
new studies at the regional to global scale have generally had a greater

"The role of austral winter swell waves on ESL have been investigated
in the Gulf of Guinea (Melet et al. 2016) and the Maldives
(Wadey et al. 2017). Multivariate statistical analysis and probabilistic
modelling is used to show that flood risk in the northern Gulf of
Mexico is higher than determined from short observational records
(Wahl et al. 2016). In Australia, changes in ESLs were modelled
using four CMIPS RCP8.5 simulations (Colberg et al. 2019). On
the southern mainland coast, the southward movement of the
subtropical ridge in the climate models led to small reductions (up
to 0.4 m) in the modelled 20-year (5% probability of occurring
in a year) storm surge. Over the Gulf of Carpentaria in the north,
changes were largest and positive during austral summer in two
out of the four models in response to a possible eastward shift in
the northwest monsoon. Synthetic cyclone modelling was used to
evaluate probabilities, interannual variability and future changes of
extreme water levels from tides and TC-induced storm surge (storm
tide) along the coastlines of Fiji (McInnes et al. 2014) and Samoa
(McInnes et al. 2016). Higher resolution modelling for Apia, Samoa
incorporating waves highlights that although SLR reduces wave
setup and wind setup by 10-20%, during storm surges it increases
wave energy reaching the shore by up to 200% (Hoeke et al. 2015).

a preventable high number of casualties (Dalisay and De Guzman,

"An assessment of future changes in coastal impacts based on direct
downscaling of indicators of flooding such as total water level and
number of hours per year with breakwater overtopping over a given

indicators are multivariable and include the combined effect of SLR,
storm surge, astronomical tide and waves. Regional projected wave
climate is downscaled from global multi-model projections from
30 CMIP5 model realisations. For example, projections by 2100 under
the RCP8.5 scenario show a spatial variability along the coast of
Chile with port operability loss between 600-800 h yr and around
200 h yr relative to present (1979-2005) conditions. Although wave
changes are included in projected overtopping distributions, future
changes of operability are mainly due to the SLR contribution.

"If rebuilding in situ is pursued after catastrophic events and without

urban plans integrating climate change concerns, that are inclusive
of vegetation barriers as coastal defences and hybrid designs, are
considered (Cheong et al. 2013; Saleh and Weinstein, 2016). However,
often more physical structures that are known to be less sustainable
in the long-term, but potentially more protective in the short-term,
are constructed (Knowlton and Rotkin-Ellman, 2014; Rosenzweig

"The most effective risk management strategy in the last few decades
has been the development of early warning systems for cyclones
(Hallegatte, 2013). Generally, however, a lack of familiarity with the
changed nature of storms prevails. Powerful storms often generate
record storm surges (Needham et al. 2015), such as in the cases of
Cyclone Nargis and Typhoon Haiyan but surge warnings had been less
well understood and followed because they had tended to be new or
rare to the locality (Lagmay et al. 2015). A US study on storm surge
warnings highlights the issue of the right timing to warn, as well as
the difficulty in delivering accurate surge maps (Morrow et al. 2015).

Jakobsen (2012) on Hurricane Mitch in Nicaragua, and Taupo and
Noy (2017) on TC Pam in Tuvalu. The relation between changes in
TCs and property losses is complex, and there are indications that
wind shear changes may have larger impact than changes in global
temperatures (Wang and Toumi, 2016). With regard to loss of life,
total fatalities and mortality from cyclone-related coastal flooding is
globally declining, probably as a result of improved forecasting and
evacuation, although in some low-income countries mortality is still
high (Paul, 2009; Lumbroso et al. 2017; Bouwer and Jonkman, 2018).

"After the storms, retreat or rebuild options exist. Rebuilding options
can depend on whether insurance is still affordable after the event.
Buyout programs, a form of ‘managed retreat’ whereby government
agencies pay people affected by extreme weather events to relocate
to safer areas, gained traction in recent years as a potential solution
to reduce exposure to changing storm surge and flood risk. The
decision to retreat or rebuild in situ depends, at least partially, on
how communities have recovered in the past and therefore on the
perceived success of a future recovery (Binder, 2014). However,
political and jurisdictional conflicts between local, regional, and
national government over land management responsibilities, lack
of coordinated nation-wide adaptation plans, and clashes between
individual and community needs have led to some unpopular buyout
programs after Hurricane Sandy (Boet-Whitaker, 2017). Relocation
(ie., managed retreat) is often very controversial, can incur significant
political risk even when it is in principle voluntary (Gibbs et al. 2016),
and is rarely implemented with much success at larger scales (Beine
and Parsons, 2015; Hino et al. 2017). In addition, managed retreats are
often fraught with legal, distributional and human rights issues, as seen
in the case of resettlements after Typhoon Haiyan (Thomas, 2015; see
also Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1), and extend to loss of cultural
heritage and indigenous qualities in the case of small island states.

"MHWs have been observed and documented in all ocean basins over
the last two decades (Figure 6.3a, Figure 6.2, Table 6.2). Prominent
examples include the Northeast Pacific 2013-2015 MHW (often

"Superimposed onto the long-term ocean warming trend are short-
term extreme warming events, called MHWs, during which ocean
temperatures are extremely high. Whereas the response of marine
organisms and ecosystems to gradual trends in temperature
has been assessed in ARS (eg., Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2014;
Pértner et al. 2014), research on the response of the natural, physical
and socioeconomic systems to MHWs has newly emerged since AR5.
Notable exceptions are studies on the effect of MHWs on intertidal
systems and tropical coral reef ecosystems, which have been already
assessed in AR5 (Gattuso et al. 2014; Portner et al. 2014).

"The observed trend towards more frequent, intense and extensive
MHWs, defined relative to a fixed baseline period, is very likely due
to the long-term anthropogenic increase in mean ocean temperatures,
and cannot be explained by natural climate variability (Frélicher et al.
2018; Oliver et al. 201 8a; Oliver, 2019). As climate models project a long-
term increase in ocean temperatures over the 21st century (Collins et al.
2013), a further increase in the probability of MHWs under continued
global warming can be expected (see Section 6.4.1.3). Extending the

strengthened and shifted the Leeuwin Current southward along the

Blob, which emerged in 2013 in response to teleconnections between
the North Pacific and the weak EI Nifio that drove strong positive
sea level pressure anomalies across the northeast Pacific inducing
a smaller heat loss from the ocean (Bond et al. 2015; Di Lorenzo and

may have also played a role (Lee et al. 2015a).

"The buildup and decay of extreme warm SSTs may also be caused
by small-scale atmospheric and oceanic processes, such as ocean
mesoscale eddies or local atmospheric weather patterns (Carrigan
and Puotinen, 2014; Schlegel et al. 2017a; Schlegel et al. 2017b). For
example, the Tasman Sea 2015-2016 MHW was caused by enhanced
southward transport in the East Australian current driven by increased
wind stress curl across the mid-latitude South Pacific (Oliver and
Holbrook, 2014; Oliver et al. 2017) with local downwelling-favourable
winds also having played a role in the subsurface intensification of
the MHW (Schaeffer and Roughan, 2017). In addition, the 2016 MHW
in the southern part of the Great Barrier Reef was mitigated by the
ETC Winston that passed over Fiji on February 20th. The cyclone
caused strong winds, cloud cover and rain, which lowered SST and
prevented corals from bleaching (Hughes et al. 2017b).

"MHWs are periods of extremely high ocean temperatures that persist
for days to months, can extend up to thousands of kilometres and
can penetrate multiple hundreds of metres into the deep ocean
(see SROCC Glossary; Hobday et al. 2016a; Scannell et al. 2016;
Benthuysen et al. 2018). A MHW is an event at a particular place and
time of the year that is rare and predominately, but not exclusively,
defined with a relative threshold; that is, an event rarer than 90th
or 99th percentile of a probability density function. By definition,
the characteristics of what is called a MHW may therefore vary
from place to place in an absolute sense. Different metrics are used
to quantify changes in MHW characteristics, such as frequency,
duration, intensity, spatial extent and severity. To monitor and
predict coral bleaching risk, the metric degree heating week (DHW;
e.g., Eakin et al. 2010) is often used, which combines the effect of
duration and magnitude of the heatwave.
"	Text
"The dominant ocean and/or atmospheric processes leading to the
buildup, persistence and decay of MHWs vary greatly among the
individual MHWs and depend on the location and time of occurrence.
One of the most important global driver of MHWs are El Nifio events
(Oliver et al. 2018a). During El Nifio events, the SST, in particular of
the central and eastern equatorial Pacific and the Indian Ocean, are
anomalously warm (see Section 6.5). MHWs may also be associated
with other large-scale modes of climate variability, such as the Pacific
Decadal Oscillation (PDO), AMO, Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), North
Pacific Oscillation and NAO, which modulate ocean temperatures at
the regional scale (Benthuysen et al. 2014; Bond et al. 2015; Chen et al.
2015b; Di Lorenzo and Mantua, 2016). These modes can change the
strength, direction and location of ocean currents that build up areas
of extreme warm waters, or they can change the air-sea heat flux,
leading to a warming of the ocean surface from the atmosphere.
"	Text
"The upper ocean temperature has significantly increased in most
regions over the last few decades, with anthropogenic forcing very
likely being the main driver (Bindoff et al. 2013). Concurrent with the
long-term increase in upper ocean temperatures, MHWs have become
more frequent, extensive and intense (Frélicher and Laufkétter, 2018;
Oliver et al. 2018a; Smale et al. 2019). Analysis of satellite daily SST data
reveal that the number of MHW days exceeding the 99th percentile,
calculated over the 1982-2016 period, has doubled globally between
1982 and 2016, from about 2.5 heatwave days yr! to 5 heatwave
days yr- (Frélicher et al. 2018; Oliver et al. 2018a). At the same time,
the maximum intensity of MHWs has increased by 0.15°C and the
spatial extent by 66% (Frolicher et al. 2018). Using a classification
system to separate MHWs into categories (I-IV, depending on the level
to which SSTs exceed local averages), Hobday et al. (2018) show that
the occurrence of MHWs has increased for all categories over the past
35 years with the largest increase (24%) in strong (Category II) MHW
events. In 2016, about a quarter of the surface ocean experienced either
the longest or most intense MHW (Hobday et al. 2016a; Figure 6.3b).
"	Text
"sets, Oliver et al. (2018a) show that the global frequency and duration
of MHWs have increased since 1925. At regional scale, MHWs have
become more common in 38% of the world’s coastal ocean over the
last few decades (Lima and Wethey, 2012). In tropical reef systems,
the interval between recurrent MHWs and associated coral bleaching
events has diminished steadily since 1980, from once every 25 to
30 years in early 1980s to once every 6 years in 2016 (Hughes et al.
2018a). Due to the scarcity of below surface temperature data with
high temporal and spatial resolution, it is currently unknown if and how
MHWs at depth have changed over the past decades.
"	Text
"Several attribution studies (summarised in Table 6.2) have investigated
if the likelihood of individual MHW events has changed due to
anthropogenic warming. On a global scale and at present day (2006—
2015), climate models suggest that 84-90% (very likely range) of all
globally occurring MHWs are attributable to the temperature increase
since 1850-1900 (Fischer and Knutti, 2015; Frdlicher et al. 2018).
Attribution studies on individual MHW events show that the intensity
of the western tropical Pacific MHW in 2014 (Weller et al. 2015), the
intensity of the Alaskan Sea 2016 MHW (Oliver et al. 2018b; Walsh

"In other words, the aforementioned studies show that such events
could not have occurred without the temperature increase since
1850-1900. In addition, extreme SSTs in the northeast Pacific in 2014
have become about five times more likely with human-induced global
warming (Wang et al. 2014a; Kam et al. 2015; Weller et al. 2015). The
Tasman Sea 2015-2016 MHW was 330 times (for duration) and 6.8
times (for intensity) more likely with anthropogenic climate change
than without (Oliver et al. 2017), and the northern Australia 2016
MHW was up to fifty times more likely due to anthropogenic climate
change (Weller et al. 2015; King et al. 2017; Lewis and Mallela,
2018; Newman et al. 2018; Oliver et al. 2018b). Also the risk of the
Great Barrier Reef bleaching event in 2016 was increased due to
anthropogenic climate change (King et al. 2017; Lewis and Mallela,
2018). Even though natural variability is still needed for the events
to occur, these studies show that most of the individual MHW events
analysed so far have a clear human-induced signal. However, such
attribution studies have not been undertaken for all major individual
MHW events yet (e.g., five out of ten MHWs indicated in Figure 6.3a
have not been assessed), and it is therefore still unknown for some of
the observed individual MHW events if they have an anthropogenic
signal or not (labelled as ‘unknown’ in Figure 6.3a).

intensity (maximum exceedance of the 1850-1900 99th percentile)
will very likely increase from 0.3°C-0.4°C in 1850-1900, to 3.1°C-
3.8°C in 2081-2100 under the RCP8.5 scenario. Under the RCP2.6
scenario, the magnitude of changes in the different MHW metrics
would be substantially reduced (Frélicher et al. 2018). For example,
the probability ratio would very likely increase by a factor of 16-24
by 2081-2100 for RCP2.6; less than half of that is projected for the
RCP8.5. The magnitude of changes in the probability ratio scales with
global mean atmospheric surface temperature and is independent
of the warming path (Figure 6.4b), that is, it does not depend on
whether a particular warming level is reached sooner (RCP8.5) or
later (RCP2.6).

The shaded bands indicate the 90% confidence interval of the standard error of the mean. The black line shows an observational-based estimate. As daily SST data are
available only for the 1982-2016 period, we assume that the observed mean temperature change is the main cause of the change in frequency of extremes (Frdlicher et al.
2018; Oliver, 2019). We therefore subtracted first the differences between 1854-1900 and 1982-2016 obtained from the extended reconstructed SST Version 4 dataset
(ERSSTv4; Huang et al. 2015a) from the daily satellite data before calculating the 99th percentile for the observations. (b) Same as (a), but the probability ratio is plotted

"Temperature plays an essential role in the biology and ecology of marine
organisms (e.g., Portner, 2002; Pértner and Knust, 2007; Poloczanska
et al. 2013; Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2014), and therefore extreme high
ocean temperature can have large impacts on marine ecosystems.
Recent studies show that MHWs have strongly impacted marine
organisms and ecosystem services in all ocean basins (Smale et al. 2019)
over the last two decades. Impacts include coral bleaching and
mortality (Hughes et al. 2017b; Hughes et al. 2018a; Hughes et al.
2018b), loss of seagrass and kelp forests (Smale et al. 2019), shifts in
species range (Smale and Wernberg, 2013), and local (Wernberg et al.
2013; Wernberg et al. 2016) and potentially global extinctions of coral
species (Brainard et al. 2011).
"	Text
"Most of the global changes in the probability of MHWs, when
defined relative to a fixed temperature climatology and using coarse
resolution CMIP5-type climate models, are driven by the global-scale
shift in the mean ocean temperature (Alexander et al. 2018; Frolicher
et al. 2018). However, previously ice-covered regions, such as the
Arctic Ocean, will exhibit larger SST variability under future global
warming. This is because of an enhanced SST increase in summer
due to sea ice retreat, but SST remaining near the freezing point in
winter (Carton et al. 2015; Alexander et al. 2018). When contrasting
the changes in the probability of MHWs with land-based heatwaves
(Fischer and Knutti, 2015), it is evident that MHWs are projected to
occur more frequently (Frélicher et al. 2018; Frélicher and Laufkotter,
2018). This is because the temperature variability is much smaller
in ocean surface waters than in the atmosphere (Frélicher and
Laufk6tter, 2018).

"number of MHW days (Alexander et al. 2018; Frélicher et al. 2018).
Smallest increases are projected for the Southern Ocean. In addition,
MHW events in the Great Barrier Reef, such as the one associated with
the bleaching in 2016, are projected to be at least twice as frequent
under 2°C global warming than they are today (King et al. 2017). The
magnitude of projected changes at the local scale is uncertain, partly
due to issues of horizontal and vertical resolution of CMIP5-type Earth
system models. Only a few studies have used higher resolution oceanic
models (eddy-resolving) to assess the local-to-regional changes in
MHW characteristics. For example, regional high-resolution coupled
climate model simulations suggest that the Mediterranean Sea will
experience at least one long lasting MHW every year by the end of
the 21st century under the RCP8.5 scenario (Darmaraki et al. 2019),
and eddy-resolving ocean model simulations project a further increase
in the likelihood of extreme temperature events in the Tasman Sea
(Oliver et al. 2014; Oliver et al. 2015; Oliver et al. 2017).
"	Text
"A growing number of studies have reported that MHWs negatively
affect corals and coral reefs through bleaching, disease, and mortality
(see Chapter 5 for an extensive discussion on coral reefs and coral
bleaching). The recent (2014-2017) high ocean temperatures in
the tropics and subtropics triggered a pan-tropical episode of
unprecedented mass bleaching of corals (100s of km?), the third
global-scale event after 1997-1998 and 2010 (Heron et al. 2016;
Eakin et al. 2017; Hughes et al. 201 7b; Eakin et al. 2018; Hughes et al.
2018a). The heat stress during this event was sufficient to cause
bleaching at 75% of global reefs (Hughes et al. 2018a; Figure 6.3b)
and mortality at 30% (Eakin et al. 2017), much more than any
previously documented global bleaching event. In some locations,
many reefs bleached extensively for the first time on record, and over
half of the reefs bleached multiple times during the three year event.
However, there were distinct geographical variations in bleaching,
mainly determined by the spatial pattern and magnitude of the MHW
(Figure 6.3b). For example, bleaching was extensive and severe in the
northern regions of the Great Barrier Reef, with 93% of the northern
Australian Great Barrier Reef coral suffering bleaching in 2016, but
impacts were moderate at the southern coral reefs of the Great
Barrier Reef (Brainard et al. 2018; Stuart-Smith et al. 2018).
"	Text
"Apart from strong impacts on corals, recent MHWs have demonstrated
their potential impacts on other marine ecosystems and ecosystems
services (Ummenhofer and Meehl, 2017; Smale et al. 2019). Two of
the best studied MHWs with extensive ecological implications are the
Western Australia 2011 MHW and the Northeast Pacific 2013-2015
MHW. The Western Australia 2011 MHW resulted in a regime shift of
the temperate reef ecosystem (Wernberg et al. 2013; Wernberg et al.
2016). The abundance of the dominant habitat-forming seaweeds
Scytohalia dorycara and Ecklonia radiata became significantly
reduced and Eck/onia kelp forest was replaced by small turf-forming
algae with wide ranging impacts on associated sessile invertebrates
and demersal fish. The sea grass Amphibolis antarctica in Shark Bay
underwent defoliation after the MHW (Fraser et al. 2014), and together
with the loss of other sea grass species, these lead to releases of
2-9 Tg CO2 to the atmosphere during the subsequent three years
after the MHW (Arias-Ortiz et al. 2018). In addition, coral bleaching
and adverse impacts on invertebrate fisheries were documented
(Depczynski et al. 2013; Caputi et al. 2016). The Northeast Pacific
2013-2015 MHW also caused extensive alterations to open ocean and
coastal ecosystems (Cavole et al. 2016). Impacts included increased
mortality events of sea birds (Jones et al. 2018), salmon and marine
mammals (Cavole et al. 2016), very low ocean primary productivity
(Whitney, 2015; Jacox et al. 2016), an increase in warm water copepod
species (Di Lorenzo and Mantua, 2016) and novel species compositions
(Peterson et al. 2017). In addition, a coast wide bloom of the toxigenic
diatom Pseudo-nitzschia resulted in the largest ever recorded outbreak
of domoic acid along the North American west coast (McCabe et al.
2016). Domoic acid was detected in many marine mammals, such as
whales, dolphins, porpoises, seals and sea lions. The elevated toxins in
commercially harvested fish and invertebrates resulted in prolonged
and geographically extensive closure of razor clam and crab fisheries.

this will push some marine organisms, fisheries and ecosystem beyond
the limits of their resilience. These impacts will occur on top of those

"MHWs can impact weather patterns over land via teleconnections
causing drought, heavy precipitation or heat wave events. For
example, the Northeast Pacific 2013-2015 MHW and the associated
persistent atmospheric high-pressure ridge prevented normal winter
storms from reaching the West Coast of the US and may have
contributed to the drought conditions across the entire West Coast
(Seager et al. 2015; Di Lorenzo and Mantua, 2016). The Tasman Sea
2015-2016 MHW has increased the intensity of rainfall that caused
flooding in northeast Tasmania in January 2016 (see Box 6.1) and
the Coastal Peruvian 2017 MHW caused heavy rainfall and flooding
on the west coast of tropical South America (ENFEN, 2017; Echevin
et al. 2018; Garreaud, 2018; Takahashi et al. 2018). Similarly, MHWs
in the Mediterranean Sea may have amplified heatwaves (Feudale
and Shukla, 2007; Garcia-Herrera et al. 2010) and heavy precipitation
events over central Europe (Messmer et al. 2017), as well as trigger
intense ETCs over the Mediterranean Sea (Gonzdlez-Aleman et al.
2019). Such physical changes induced by MHWs may then also affect
ecosystems and human systems on land (Reimer et al. 2015).

"a northward movement of warm water species and local migrations
of some species (e.g., lobsters) earlier in the season (Mills et al. 2013;
Pershing et al. 2015). The Mediterranean Sea 2003 MHW lead to
mass mortalities of macro-invertebrate species (Garrabou et al.
2009) and the Tasman Sea 2015-2016 MHW had impacts on
sessile, sedentary and cultured species in the shallow, near-shore
environment including outbreaks of disease in commercially viable
species (Oliver et al. 2017). Vibrio outbreaks were also observed in
the Baltic Sea in response to elevated SSTs (Baker-Austin et al. 2013).
The Alaskan Sea 2016 MHW favoured some phytoplankton species,
leading to harmful algal blooms, shellfish poisoning events and
mortality events in seabirds (Walsh et al. 2018; see chapter 3 for more
details). Also, lower than average size of multiple groundfish species
were observed including Pollock, Pacific cod, and Chinook salmon
(Zador and Siddon, 2016). The Yellow Sea/East China Sea 2016 MHW
killed a large number of different marine organisms in coastal and bay
areas around South Korea (Kim and Han, 2017) and the Southwest
Atlantic 2017 MHW lead to toxic algal blooms (Manta et al. 2018).
The Coastal Peruvian 2017 MHW affected anchovies, which showed
decreased fat content and early spawning as a reproductive strategy
(IMPARPE, 2017), a behaviour usually seen during warm El Nifo
conditions (Niquen and Bouchon, 2004).

"MHWs can also lead to significant socioeconomic ramifications when
affecting aquaculture or important fishery species, or when triggering
heavy rain or drought events on land. The Northwest Atlantic 2012
MHW, for example, had major economic impacts on the US lobster
industry in 2015 (Mills et al. 2013). The MHWs lead to changes in
lobster fishing practices and harvest patterns, because the lobsters
moved from the deep offshore waters into shallower coastal areas
much earlier in the season than usual causing a rapid rise in lobster
catch rates. Together with a supply chain bottleneck, the record
catch outstripped market demand and contributed to a collapse in
lobster prices (Mills et al. 2013). Even though high catch volumes
were reported, the price collapse threatened the economic viability of
many US and Canadian lobster fisheries. Economic impacts through
changes in fisheries were also reported during the Northeast Pacific
2013-2015 MHW and the Alaskan Sea 2016 MHW. The Northeast
Pacific 2013-2015 MHW led to closing of both commercial and
recreational fisheries resulting in millions of USD in losses among
fishing industries (Cavole et al. 2016). In addition, the toxin produced
by the harmful algal blooms can be transferred through the marine
food web and humans who eat contaminated fish, shellfish or
crustaceans (Berdalet et al. 2016; Du et al. 2016; McCabe et al. 2016).
The ingestion of such contaminated seafood products, the inhalation
of aerosolised toxins or the skin contact with toxin-contaminated
water may cause toxicity in humans. Symptoms in human associated
with the ingestion of the contaminated seafood range from mild
gastrointestinal distress to seizures, coma, permanent short-term
memory loss and death (Perl et al. 1990). The ecological changes
associated with the Alaskan Sea 2016 MHW impacted subsistence
and commercial activities. For example, ice-based harvesting of seals,
crabs and fish in western Alaska was delayed due to the lack of
winter sea ice. MHWs can also impact the socioeconomic and human
system through changes to weather patterns. For example, heavy rain
associated with the Coastal Peruvian 2017 MHW triggered numerous
landslides and flooding, which resulted in a death toll of several
hundred, and widespread damage to infrastructure and civil works
(United Nations, 2017).

This has resulted in significant new literature regarding physical

toward the central equatorial Pacific causing floods in many regions of
the world such as those in the west coasts of the USA and other parts
of North America, some parts of South America close to Argentina
and Uruguay, the UK and China (Ward et al. 2014; Ward et al. 2016;

sectors, public health officials and citizens were not forewarned of the
Coastal Peruvian 2017 MHW, despite a basin-wide monitoring system
across the Pacific. The reason was partly due to a coastal El Nifio
definition problem and a new government (in Nicaragua) that may have
hindered actions (Ramirez and Briones, 2017). Therefore, early warning

the 2015 bleaching and to place specimens of rare corals in climate
controlled, onshore nurseries in response to these forecast systems

(Hobday et al. 2016b; Payne et al. 2017; Tommasi et al. 2017b).
For example, seasonal forecasts of SST around Tasmania may help
farm managers of salmon aquaculture to prepare and respond to
upcoming MHWs by changing stocking densities, varying feed mixes,
transferring fish to different locations in the farming region and
implementing disease management (Spillman and Hobday, 2014;
Hobday et al. 2016b). Skilful multi-annual to decadal SST predictions
may also inform and improve decisions about spatial and industrial
planning, as well as the management of various extractive sectors
such as the adjustments to quotas for internationally shared fish
stocks (Tommasi et al. 2017a). It has been shown that global climate
forecasts have significant skill in predicting the occurrence of above
average warm or cold SST events at decadal timescales in coastal
areas (Tommasi et al. 2017a), but barriers to their widespread usage
in fishery and aquaculture industry still exist (Tommasi et al. 2017b).

"Palaeo-ENSO studies suggest that ENSO was highly variable throughout
the Holocene, with no evidence for a systematic trend in ENSO variance
(Cobb et al. 2013) but with some indication that the ENSO variance
over 1979-2009 has been much larger than that over 1590-1880
(McGregor et al. 2013). Palaeo-ENSO reconstruction for the past eight
centuries suggests that central Pacific ENSO activity has increased
between the last two decades (1980-2015; Liu et al. 2017b), with
an increasing number of central Pacific El Nifio events compared to
east Pacific El Nifio events (Freund et al. 2019). Further proxy evidence
exists for changes in the mean state of the equatorial Pacific in the last
2000 years (Rustic et al. 2015; Henke et al. 2017). Simulations using
an Earth System Model indicate significantly higher ENSO variance
during 1645-1715 than during the 21st century warm period, though
it is unclear whether these simulated changes are realistic (Keller et al.
2015). For the 20th century, the frequency and intensity of El Nifio events
were high during 1951-2000, in comparison with the 1901-1950
period (Lee and McPhaden, 2010; Kim et al. 2014b; Roxy et al. 2014).
Current instrumental observational records are not long enough and
the quality of data before 1950 is limited, to assert these changes with
high confidence (Wittenberg, 2009; Stevenson et al. 2010) though the
palaeo records mentioned here signal the emergence of a statistically
significant increase in ENSO variance in recent decades.

EI Nifio events is projected to continue, under increasing emissions
(Freund et al. 2019). Further, CMIP5 models indicate that the risk of
major rainfall disruptions has already increased for countries where
the rainfall variability is linked to ENSO variability. This risk will remain
elevated for the entire 21st century, even if substantial reductions in
global GHG emissions are made (medium confidence). The increase
in disruption risk is caused by anthropogenic warming that drives an
increase in the frequency and magnitude of ENSO events and also
by changes in background SST patterns (Power et al. 2013; Chung
et al. 2014; Huang and Xie, 2015). While many of these studies have
adopted the precipitation view of an extreme El Nino, studies also
indicate an increase in SST variability for events with their main SST
anomalies in the east Pacific (Cai et al. 2018). Also, a role of cross-
equatorial winds has been identified (Hu and Fedorov, 2018).

EI Nifio), there is an initial decrease in atmospheric CO2 concentrations
over the tropical Pacific Ocean, due to suppression of equatorial
upwelling, reducing the supply of CO: to the surface (Chatterjee et al.
2017), followed by a rise in atmospheric COz concentrations due
reduced terrestrial CO2 uptake and increased fire emissions (Bastos

heat discharge due to El Nifio can intensify TCs in the eastern Pacific
(Jin et al. 2014; Moon et al. 2015b). TCs are projected to become more
frequent (~20-40%) during future-climate El Nifio events compared
with present climate El Nifio events (medium confidence), and less
frequent during future-climate La Nifia events, around a group of
small island nations (for example, Fiji, Vanuatu, Marshall Islands and

"The dynamic processes related to the projected changes in IOD under
global warming have a large inter-model spread (Cai et al. 2013). The
frequency of extreme positive IOD events are projected to increase
by almost a factor of three, from a one-in-seventeen-year event in
the 20th century to a one-in-six-year event in the 21st century (low
confidence). The bias in the CMIP5 models and internal variability
could enlarge the projected increase in the extreme positive |OD
events (Li et al. 2016a; Hui and Zheng, 2018). The increase in |OD
events is not linked to the change in the frequency of El Nifio
events but instead to mean state change—with weakening of
both equatorial westerly winds and eastward oceanic currents in
association with a faster warming in the western than the eastern
equatorial Indian Ocean (Cai et al. 2014b). A combination of extreme
ENSO and IOD events has led to a northward shift in the Intertropical
Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during 1979-2015, which is expected to
increase further in the future (Freitas et al. 2017).

might further impact natural and human systems. El Nifio causes
either positive or negative precipitation anomalies in diverse
regions of the globe. Dry El Nifio teleconnection anomalies may be
further strengthened by, either mean climate drying in the region
(Amazon, Central America and Australia in June to August (JJA)), or
a strengthening of the El Nifio dry teleconnection, or both. Conversely,
wet EI Nifio teleconnections can be further strengthened by either
increases in mean precipitation (East Africa and southeastern South

"Increasing frequency of extreme ENSO and IOD events have the
potential to have widespread impacts on natural and human systems
in many parts of the globe. Though the occurrence of the extreme
2015-2016 El Nifio has produced a large body of literature, itis still not
clear how climate change may have altered such an impact, nor how
such impacts might change in the future with increasing frequency
of extreme ENSO events. We highlight here some studies that have
attempted to assess the joint impact of mean change and variability.
In addition to observed high variability of rainfall, severe weather
events and impacts on TCs activity (Yonekura and Hall, 2014; Zhang
and Guan, 2014; Wang and Liu, 2016; Zhan, 2017), extreme El Nino
events have substantial impacts on natural systems which include
those on marine ecosystems (Sanseverino et al. 2016; Mogollon
and Calil, 2017; Ohman et al. 2017), such as severe and repeated
bleaching of corals (Hughes et al. 2017a; Hughes et al. 2017b; Eakin
et al. 2018), and glacial growth and retreat (Thompson et al. 2017).
On the other hand, impacts on human, including managed systems
are: increased incidences of forest fires (Christidis et al. 2018b; Tett
et al. 2018), degraded air quality (Koplitz et al. 2015; Chang et al.
2016; Zhai et al. 2016) such as the dense haze over most parts of
Indonesia and the neighboring countries in Southeast Asia as a result
of prolonged Indonesian wildfires, thus imposing adverse impacts on
public health in the affected areas (Koplitz et al. 2015; WMO, 2016),
decreased agricultural yields in many parts of the globe (e.g., in most

and El Nifio response may be in the opposite direction (Southeast
Asia, JJA and Central North America, DJF). Such changes could have
an impact on phenomena such as wildfires (Fasullo et al. 2018).
However, in many other regions that are currently impacted by El Nifio,
eg., regions of South America, studies have found no significant
changes in the ENSO-precipitation relationship (Tedeschi and Collins,
2017) and agreement between models for many regions suggests ow

"Risk management of ENSO events has focussed on two main aspects:
better prediction and early warning systems, and better mechanisms for
reducing risks to agriculture, infrastructure, fisheries and aquaculture,
wildfire and flood management. Extreme ENSO events are rare, with
three such events since 1950 and they are difficult to predict due to the
different drivers influencing them (Puy et al. 2017). The impacts of ENSO
events also vary between events and between the different regions
affected (Murphy et al. 2014; Fasullo et al. 2018; Power and Delage,
2018) however, there is limited literature on the change in the impacts
of extreme ENSO compared to other ENSO events. In addition, there are
also no specific risk management and adaptation strategies for human
and natural systems for more extreme events other than what is in
place for ENSO events (see also Chapter 4, Section 4.4 for the response
to sea level change, an observed impact of ENSO). A first step in risk
management and adaptation is thus to better understand the impacts
these events have and to identify conditions that herald such extreme
events that could be used to better predict extreme ENSO events.

"Monitoring and forecasting are the most developed ways to manage
extreme ENSOs. Several systems are already in place for monitoring
and predicting seasonal climate variability and ENSO occurrence.
However, the sustainability of the observing system is challenging
and currently the Tropical Pacific Observing System 2020 (TPOS 2020)
has the task of redesigning such a system, with ENSO prediction as
one of its main objectives. These systems could be further elaborated
to include extreme ENSO events. Westerly wind events in the Western

sea fluxes and atmospheric deep convection (Bellenger et al. 2014;
Takahashi and Dewitte, 2016) and advection of mean temperature
by anomalous eastward zonal currents (Kim and Cai, 2014) are
some of the factors that play an important role in the evolution of
extreme ENSO events, which can be considered while improving the

"Along with extreme El Nifio events, abrupt warming in the Indian
Ocean and extreme IOD events have largely altered the Asian
and African monsoon, impacting the food and water security over
these regions. As a response to rising global SSTs and partially
due to extreme El Nifio events, the NH summer monsoon showed
substantial intensification during 1979-2011, with an increase in
rainfall by 9.5% per degree Celsius of global warming (Wang et al.
2013). However, the Indian summer monsoon circulation and rainfall
exhibits a statistically significant weakening since the 1950s. This
weakening has been hypothesised to be a response to the Indian
Ocean basin-wide warming (Mishra et al. 2012; Roxy et al. 2015)
and also to increased aerosol emissions (Guo et al. 2016) and
changes in land use (Paul et al. 2016). Warming in the north Indian
Ocean has resulted in increasing fluctuations in the southwest
monsoon winds and a three-fold increase in extreme rainfall events
across central India (Roxy et al. 2017). The frequency and duration
of heatwaves have increased over the Indian subcontinent, and
these events are associated with the Indian Ocean basin-wide
warming and frequent El Nifios (Rohini et al. 2016). In April 2016,
as a response to the extreme El Nifio, Southeast Asia experienced
surface air temperatures that surpassed national records, increased
energy consumption, disrupted agriculture and resulted in severe
human discomfort (Thirumalai et al. 2017). A strong negative |OD
event in 2016 led to large climate impact on East African rainfall,
with some regions recording below 50% of normal rainfall, leading
to devastating drought, food insecurity and unsafe drinking water for
over 15 million people in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya.

"In principle, it is easier to transfer the financial risk associated with
extreme ENSO events through, for example, insurance products or
other risk transfer instruments such as Catastrophe Bonds, than
for more moderate events. An accurate prediction system is not
required, but the measurement of these events, and quantification
of likely impacts is required. As in other types of insurance
systems, this can be done through, for example, calculations of
average annual losses associated with extreme ENSO, and the
design of appropriate financial instruments. Examples of research
that can support the design of risk transfer instruments include
Anderson et al. (2018) and Gelcer et al. (2018) for specific crops
yields, and Aguilera et al. (2018) and Broad et al. (2002) for specific

to deal with ENSO impacts, including parametric insurance
based on SSTs for heavy rainfall damages, and another scheme
for agricultural damages, both in Peru. Other examples include

"Under 1.5°C warming both El Nifio and La Nifia frequencies may
increase (see Section 6.5) and hence ITF variability may also increase.
ITF is also influenced by the |OD events, with an increase in transport
during a positive IOD and vice-versa during a negative IOD event
(Potemra and Schneider, 2007; Pujiana et al. 2019). Positive |ODs
are projected to increase threefold in the 21st century as a response
to changes in the mean state rather than changes in the El Nifio
frequency (Section 6.5.1.2; Cai et al. 2014b) and this may have
an impact on the ITF, additional to the changes due to increasing
extreme ENSO events. In response to greenhouse warming, climate
models predict that on interannual time scale, it is /ikely that the mean
ITF may decrease due to wind variability (Sen Gupta et al. 2016),
but recent observation trend tends to strengthen which has led to
speculations about the fidelity of the current climate models (Chung
et al. 2019). On multidecadal and centennial timescales, it is likely
that mean ITF decreases which is not associated with wind variability
but due to reduction of net deep ocean upwelling in the tropical
South Pacific (Sen Gupta et al. 2016; Feng et al. 2017; Feng et al.
2018). Due to a lack of long-term sustained ITF observations, their
impacts on Indo-Pacific climate varibility, biogeochemisty, ecosystem
as well as society are not fully understood.

"In the last two decades, total water transport from the Pacific to
the Indian Ocean and the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean has
increased (high confidence). Increased ITF has been attributed to
Pacific cooling and basin-wide warming in the Indian Ocean. The ITF
annual average is 15 x 10° m3 s~' (Susanto et al. 2012). ITF varies
from intraseasonal to decadal time scales. On seasonal time scale,
South China Sea Throughflow controls freshwater flux and modulates
the main ITF (Fang et al. 2010; Susanto et al. 2013; Lee et al. 2019;
Wang et al. 2019; Wei et al. 2019). During the extreme El Nifio of
1997-1998, the ITF transport was reduced to 9.2 x 10° m? s7.
Based on observations and proxy records from satellite altimetry
and gravimetry, in the last two decades, 1992-2012, ITF has been
stronger (Sprintall and Revelard, 2014; Liu et al. 2015a; Susanto and
Song, 2015), which translates to an increase in ocean heat-flux into
the Indian Ocean (Lee et al. 2015b). Exchanges of heat and fresh
water between ocean basins are important at the global scale
(Flato et al. 2013). ITF may have played a key role in the slowdown of
the Pacific SST warming during 1998-2013, and the rapid warming
in the surface and subsurface Indian Ocean during this period
(Section 6.5.1.2; Makarim et al. 2019), by transferring warm water
from the western Pacific into the Indian Ocean (Lee et al. 2015b;

"Among the number of potential causes of this decadal variability in
surface global temperature, a prolonged negative phase of the Pacific
Decadal Oscillation/Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (PDO/IPO) was
suggested as a contributor. Because of the magnitude and duration of
this Pacific-centred variability (Figure 6.7), it is identified as an extreme
decadal climate event. One line of research has explored the role of
the warm tropical Atlantic decadal variability in forcing the trade wind
trends and associated cooling Pacific SST trends (Kucharski et al. 2011;
McGregor et al. 2014; Li et al. 201 6b). Itappears that climate models may
misrepresent this link due to tropical Atlantic biases (Kajtar et al. 2018;
McGregor et al. 2018) and thus potentially underestimate global mean
temperature decadal variability. Nevertheless, there is no indication
that such an underestimation of global temperature variability is
evident in the models (Flato et al. 2013; Marotzke and Forster, 2015).
The impact of modes of natural variability on global mean temperature

"between reanalysis products going back in time.) Moreover, it is very
unusual when model simulations are used as an estimate of internal
climate variability (Figure 6.7; England et al. 2014; Kociuba and Power,
2015). The slowdown in global surface warming is dominated by the
cooling in the Pacific SSTs, which is associated with a strengthening
of the Pacific trade winds (Kosaka and Xie, 2013). This pattern leads
to cooling over land and possibly to additional heat uptake by the
ocean, although recent studies suggest that ocean heat uptake
may even slow down during surface warming slowdown periods
(Xie et al. 2016; von Kanel et al. 2017). The intensification of the
Pacific trade winds has been related to inter-ocean basin SST trends,
with rapid warming in the Indian (see section 6.5.1.2) and Atlantic
Oceans both hypothesised as drivers (Kucharski et al. 2011; Luo et al.
2012; McGregor et al. 2014; Zhang and Karnauskas, 2017). While the
extreme event of strengthening trade winds are potentially a result
of natural internal variability, a role of anthropogenic contribution
has not been ruled out. Nevertheless, the CMIP5 models indicate no
general change in trends into the future (Figure 6.7), giving more
weight to natural internal variability as an explanation.

"In the Indian Ocean, water exits the Indonesian Seas mostly
flowing westward along with the South Equatorial Current, and
some supplying the Leeuwin Current. The South Equatorial Current
feeds the heat and biogeochemical signatures from the Indian
Ocean into the Agulhas Current, which transports it further into the
Atlantic Ocean. Observations of Mozambique Channel inflow from
2003-2012 measured a mean transport of 16.7 x 10° m? s! with
a maximum in austral winter, and IOD related interannual variability
of 8.9 x 106 m3 s (Ridderinkhof et al. 2010). A multidecadal proxy,
from three years of mooring data and satellite altimetry, suggests
that the Agulhas Current has been broadening since the early 1990s
due to an increase in eddy kinetic energy (Beal and Elipot, 2016).
Numerical model experiments suggest an intensification of the
Agulhas leakage since the 1960s, which has contributed to the
warming in the upper 300 m of the tropical Atlantic Ocean (Ltibbecke
et al. 2015). Agulhas leakage is found to covary with the AMOC on
decadal and multi-decadal timescales and has likely contributed
to the AMOC slowdown (Biastoch et al. 2015; Kelly et al. 2016).
Meanwhile, climate projections indicate that Agulhas leakage is likely
to strengthen and may partially compensate the AMOC slowdown
projected by coarse-resolution climate models (Loveday et al. 2015).

"Examination of 14 models from the CMIP5 archive, which do not
take into account the melting (either from runoff, basal melting or
icebergs) from the GIS (cf. Section 6.7.1.2), led to the assessment that
the AMOC is very unlikely to collapse in the 21st century in response
to increasing GHG concentrations (IPCC, 2013). Nonetheless, the
CMIP5 models agree that a weakening of the AMOC into the 21st
century will lead to localised cooling (relative to the global mean)
centred in the North Atlantic SPG (Menary and Wood, 2018),
although the precise location as well as the extension of this cooling
patch, notably towards Europe, remains uncertain (Sgubin et al. 2017;
Menary and Wood, 2018).

"The Pacific cooling pattern may have significant impacts on
terrestrial carbon uptake via teleconnections. The reduced ecosystem
respiration due to the smaller warming over land has significantly
accelerated the net biome productivity and therefore increased
the terrestrial carbon sink (Ballantyne et al. 2017) and paused the
growth rate of atmospheric CO despite increasing anthropogenic
carbon emissions (Keenan et al. 2016). During the 2000s, the global
ocean carbon sink has also strengthened (Fay and McKinley, 2013;
Landschiitzer et al. 2014; Majkut et al. 2014; Landschiitzer et al. 2015;
Munro et al. 2015), reversing a trend of stagnant or declining carbon
uptake during the 1990s. It has been suggested that the upper ocean
overturning circulation has weakened during the 2000s thereby
decreasing the outgassing of natural CO2, especially in the Southern
Ocean (Landschiitzer et al. 2015), and enhanced the global ocean
CO; sink (DeVries et al. 2017). How this is connected to the global
warming slowdown is currently unclear.

"Considerable effort has been dedicated in the last decades to
improve the observation system of the large-scale ocean circulation
(e.g., Argo and its array of about 3,800 free-drifting profiling floats),
including the AMOC through dedicated large-scale observing arrays
(at 16°N (Send et al. 2011) and 26°N (McCarthy et al. 2015b), in

the tip of Greenland (Mercier et al. 2015), at 34.5°S (Meinen et al.

continuously estimated since 2004 with an annual mean estimate
of 17 + 1.9 x 10° m? s over the 2004-2017 period (Smeed

in 2008-2017 than in the first four years of measurement (Smeed

if there is a long-term decline of the AMOC. McCarthy et al. (2012)
reported a 30% reduction in the AMOC in 2009-2010, followed by
a weaker minimum a year later. Analysis of forced ocean models

"During the last interglacial warm period, palaeo-data suggest that the
AMOC may have been weaker (Govin et al. 2012) and also show proxy
record evidences of instabilities (Galaasen et al. 2014). Based on an
AMOC reconstruction using SST fingerprints, it has been suggested
that the AMOC may have experienced around 3 + 1 x 10° m? st
of weakening (about 15% decrease) since the mid-20th century
(Caesar et al. 2018). Such a trend in AMOC was also suspected in
a former study using Principal Component Analysis of SST (Dima and
Lohmann, 2010). Palaeo-proxies also highlight that the historical era
may exhibit an unprecedented low AMOC over the last 1,600 years
(Sherwood et al. 2011; Rahmstorf et al. 2015; Thibodeau et al.
2018; Thornalley et al. 2018). Nevertheless, these proxy records are
indirect measurements of the AMOC so that considerable uncertainty
remains concerning these results. Moreover, the exact mechanisms
to explain such a long-term weakening are not fully understood
and some reconstructions show a weakening starting very early
in the historical era, when the level of anthropogenic perturbation
and warming was very low. Climate model simulations (Figure 6.8)
do show a weakening over the historical era, but this weakening
is mainly occurring over the recent decades. Climate projections
exhibit a weakening of around 1.4 + 1.4 x 10° m? s“ for present
day (2006-2015) minus pre-industrial (1850-1900), highlighting
that anthropogenic warming may have already forced an AMOC
weakening. Nevertheless, no proper detection and attribution of the
on-going changes has been led so far due to still limited observational
evidences. Thus, we conclude that there is medium confidence that the
AMOC has weakened over the historical era but there is insufficient
evidence to quantify a /ikely range of the magnitude of the change.

feedback between convective activity and salinity transport within

CMIP5 models has been confirmed in Heuze (2017), which can
notably limit a key feedback mechanism related with warm summer

"Evaluation of AMOC variations in the CMIP5 database has been
further analysed in this report (Figure 6.8) using almost twice as
many models as in ARS (IPCC, 2013). The AR5 assessment of a very
unlikely AMOC collapse has been confirmed, although one model
(FGOALS-s2) does show such a collapse (e.g., decrease larger than
80% relative to present day) before the end of the century for RCP8.5
scenario (Figure 6.8). Now based on up to 27 model simulations, the
decrease of the AMOC is assessed to be of -2.1 + 2.6 x 10®m? st

(-32 + 14%) for RCP8.5 scenario, in line with a process-based
probabilistic assessment (Schleussner et al. 2014). Furthermore, the
uncertainty in AMOC changes has been shown to be mainly related
to the spread in model responses rather than scenarios (RCP4.5 and
RCP8.5) or internal variability uncertainty (Reintges et al. 2017).

been further supported by high-resolution ocean-only simulations
showing that GIS melting may have affected the Labrador Sea

impact of this melting on the SPG but a still non-detectable impact on
the AMOC (Boning et al. 2016). Thus, while some studies argue that
this melting may have affected the evolution of the AMOC over the

The annual mean AMOC strength changes are taken from transient simulations and are therefore not equilibrium values per se. Moreover, it should be stressed that the
results stem from future runs, not past or historical runs. Thus, due to internal variability both in the global mean temperature and AMOC in this transient simulation, large
weakening can be found even at 0°C global warming. The ranges (66%, 90% and 99%) correspond to the amount of simulations that are within each envelope. The thick
black line corresponds to the ensemble mean, while the different colours stand for different probability quantiles. The horizontal black thick line corresponds to the value
of 80% of AMOC decrease, which can be seen as an almost total collapse of the AMOC. The horizontal black dashed thick line corresponds to a reduction of 50% of the
AMOC, which can be considered as a substantial weakening. The vertical dashed green line stands for the 1.5°C of global warming threshold (relative to 1850-1900). The

"Concerning the question of the reversibility of the AMOC, a few
ramp-up/ramp-down simulations have been performed to evaluate
it for transient time scales (a few centuries, while millennia will be
necessary for a full steady state). Results usually show a reversibility
of the AMOC (Jackson et al. 2014; Sgubin et al. 2015) although the
timing and amplitude is highly model dependent (Palter et al. 2018).
A hysteresis behaviour of the AMOC in response to freshwater
release has been found in a few climate models (Hawkins

(Mecking et al. 2016; Jackson and Wood, 2018). This is in line with

"The different potential impacts of large changes in the Atlantic
Ocean circulation are summarised in Figure 6.10. Based on variability
analysis, it has been shown that a decrease in the AMOC strength has
impacts on storm track position and intensity in the North Atlantic
(Gastineau et al. 2016), with a potential increase in the number of
winter storms hitting Europe (Woollings et al. 2012; Jackson et al.
2015), although some uncertainty remains with respect to the models
considered (Peings et al. 2016). The influence on the Arctic sea ice
cover has also been evidenced at the decadal scale, with a lower
AMOC limiting the retreat of Arctic sea ice (Yeager et al. 2015;
Delworth and Zeng, 2016). The climatic impacts could be substantial
over Europe (Jackson et al. 2015), where an AMOC weakening can
lead to high pressure over the British Isles in summer (Haarsma et al.
2015), reminiscent of a negative summer NAO, inducing an increase
in precipitation in Northern Europe and a decrease in Southern
Europe. In winter, the response of atmospheric circulation may
help to reduce the cooling signature over Europe (Yamamoto and
Palter, 2016), notably through an enhancement of warming maritime
effect due to a stronger storm track (Jackson et al. 2015), driving
more powerful storms in the North Atlantic (Hansen et al. 2016). The
observed extreme low AMOC in 2009-2010, which was followed by
a reduction in ocean heat content to the north (Cunningham et al.
2013), has been possibly implicated in cold European weather events
in winter 2009-2010 and December 2010 (Buchan et al. 2014)
although a robust attribution is missing. In summer, cold anomalies
in the SPG, like the one occurring during the so-called cold blob in
2015 (Josey et al. 2018), have been suspected to potentially enhance
the probability of heatwaves over Europe in summer (Duchez et al.
2016). Nevertheless, considerable uncertainties remain with regard
to this aspect due to the lack of historical observations before 2004
and due to poor model resolution of small-scale processes related
to frontal dynamics around the Gulf Stream region (Vanniere et al.
2017). In addition, oceanic changes in the Gulf Stream region may
occur in line with AMOC weakening (Saba et al. 2016) with potential
rapid warming due to a northward shift of the Gulf Stream. However,
these changes are largely underestimated in coarse resolution
models (Saba et al. 2016) . In North America, a negative phase of the
AMV, reminiscent of a weakening of the AMOC, lowers agricultural
production in a few Mexican coastal states (Azuz-Adeath et al. 2019).

a collapse of the AMOC may have the potential to induce a cascade

tipping points, itself potentially driven by GIS rapid melting. For
example, a collapse of the AMOC may induce causal interactions like
changes in ENSO characteristics (Rocha et al. 2018), dieback of the
Amazon rainforest and shrinking of the WAIS due to seesaw effect,
ITCZ southern migration and large warming of the Southern Ocean

poorly constrained quantitatively due to the large uncertainty in GIS

"The numerous potential impacts of AMOC weakening (see
Section 6.7.2) require adaptation responses. A specific adaptation
action is a monitoring and early warning system using observation
and prediction systems, which can help to respond in time to effects
of an AMOC decline. Although it is difficult to warn very early for
large changes in AMOC to come, notably due to large natural decadal
variability of the AMOC (Boulton et al. 2014), the observation arrays
that are in place may allow the development of such an early
warning system. Nevertheless, the prospects for its operational use
for early warnings have not yet been fully developed. In this respect,
developing early warning systems that do not depend on statistical
timeseries analysis of long observational record might be seen as an
important research goal in the future.
"	Text
"Decadal prediction systems can help fill this gap. Skilful prediction of
AMOC variation has been demonstrated on the multi-annual scale
(Matei et al. 2012) and retrospective prediction experiments have
demonstrated that the large changes in the SPG seen in the mid-1990s
could have been foreseen several years in advance (Wouters et al.
2013; Msadek et al. 2014). The World Climate Research Programme's
grand challenge of launching decadal predictions every year (Kushnir
et al. 2019) is an important step towards anticipating rapid changes
in the near term and can drive decadal-scale climate services. For
example, a few studies have already shown that small variations
anticipated by decadal predictions (e.g., Sheen et al. 2017) can be
useful for the development of climate services, notably for agriculture
in south and east Africa (Nyamwanza et al. 2017). Decadal predictions
also match the decision making time horizons of many users of the
ocean (Tommasi et al. 2017b) and are expected to play an increasingly
important role in this sector in the future (Payne et al. 2017).

which increases surface albedo (Rugenstein et al. 2013; Winton
et al. 2013), as well as cloud cover variations and modifications
in water vapour content (Trossman et al. 2016). As the uptake of
excess heat occurs preferentially in regions with delayed warming
(Winton et al. 2013; Frélicher et al. 2015; Armour et al. 2016),
a potential large reduction of the AMOC may shift the uptake of
excess heat from the low to the high latitudes (Rugenstein et al.
2013; Winton et al. 2013), where the atmosphere is more sensitive
to external forcing (Winton et al. 2010; Rose et al. 2014; Rose and
Rayborn, 2016; Rugenstein et al. 2016). A decrease in AMOC may
also decrease the subduction of anthropogenic carbon to deeper
waters (Zickfeld et al. 2008; Winton et al. 2013; Randerson et al.
2015; Rhein et al. 2017). A potential impact of methane emissions
has also been highlighted for past Heinrich events during which
massive icebergs discharge in the North Atlantic may have led to
large AMOC disruptions. Large increases (>100 ppb) in methane
production have been associated with these events (Rhodes et al.
2015) potentially due to increased wetland production in the SH,
related to teleconnections of the North Atlantic with tropical area
(Ringeval et al. 2013; Zurcher et al. 2013). All these different effects
indicate a potentially positive feedback of the AMOC on the carbon
cycle (Parsons et al. 2014), although other elements from the
terrestrial biosphere may limit its strength or even reverse its sign
(Bozbiyik et al. 2011).

"Changes in Atlantic Ocean circulation can also strongly impact
marine life and can be seen at all levels of different ecosystems.
For instance, changes in the abundance and distribution of
species in response to circulation changes in the SPG have been
documented amongst plankton (Hatuin et al. 2009), fish (Payne
et al. 2012; Miesner and Payne, 2018), seabirds (Descamps et al.
2013) and top predators such as tuna, billfish and pilot whales
(Hattn et al. 2009; MacKenzie et al. 2014). Nutrient concentrations
in the northeast Atlantic have also been shown to be limited by
the recent weakening of the SPG, with concomitant ecosystem
impacts Vohnson et al. 2013; Hatun et al. 2016). The influence
of SPG circulation also extends to ecosystems beyond from the
immediate area, and has a clear impact on the productivity of cod
(Gadus morhua) in the Barents Sea, for example (Arthun et al. 2017;
Arthun et al. 2018). On a broader scale, changes in the AMOC are an
important driver of AMV, which has also been linked to substantial
changes in marine ecosystems on both sides of the North Atlantic
(Alheit et al. 2014; Nye et al. 2014). Recent AMOC weakening is also
suspected to explain large marine deoxygenation in the northwest
coastal Atlantic (Claret et al. 2018). In addition, a recent study using
a marine productivity proxy from Greenland ice cores suggest that
net primary productivity has decreased by 10 + 7% in the subarctic
Atlantic over the past two centuries possibly related to changes
in AMOC (Osman et al. 2019). Finally, a model study investigated
the impact of mitigation by reversing the forcing from a RCP8.5
scenario from 2100 and found that global marine net productivity
may recover very rapidly and even overshoot contemporary values
at the end of the reversal, highlighting the potential benefit of
mitigation John et al. 2015).

"Compound events and cascading impacts are examples of deep
uncertainty because data deficiency often prevents the assessment
of probabilities and consequences of the risks from compound
events. Furthermore, climate drivers that contribute to compound
events could cross tipping points in the future (e.g., Cai et al. 2016;
Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 1). Concepts and methods for
addressing compound events and cascading impacts have a solid
foundation in disaster risk reduction frameworks (Scolobig, 2017)
where they may be assessed with scenarios, risk mapping, and
participatory governance (Marzocchi et al. 2012; Komendantova
et al. 2014). However, these approaches have tended to not
consider the effects of climate change, rather considering hazards
and vulnerability as stationary entities (Gallina et al. 2016). Trends
in geophysical and meteorological extreme events and their
interaction with more complex social, economic and environmental
vulnerabilities overwhelm existing governance and institutional

"Over the last decade, several efforts have been made to address
long-term shoreline change driven by the cascading impact of SLR,
waves and MSL. Ranasinghe et al. (2012) presented the Probabilistic
Coastline Recession model, which provides probabilistic estimates of
coastline recession in response to both storms and SLR in the 21st
century. Dune recession is estimated for each storm considering
the recovery between storms, which is obtained empirically. More
recently, Toimil et al. (2017) developed a methodology to address
shoreline change over this century due to the action of waves, storm
surges, astronomical tides in combination with SLR. The methodology
considers the generation of thousands of multi-variate hourly time
series of waves and storm surges to reconstruct future shoreline
evolution probabilistically, which enables estimates of extreme
recessions and long-term coastline change to be obtained. The model
proposed by Vitousek et al. (2017) integrates longshore and cross-
shore transport induced by GCM-projected waves and SLR, which
allows it to be applied to both long and pocket sandy beaches. The
analysis provides only one instance of what coastline change over

"Impacts of compound events also have significant multi-effects in
the societal system. Cascading impacts are particularly driven by
the loss or (temporary) disruption of critical infrastructure (Pescaroli
and Alexander, 2018), such as communications, transport, and
power supply, on housing, dams and flood protection; as well as
health provision. Repeated extreme and compound events are
leading to critical transitions in social systems (Kopp et al. 2016)
which may cause the disruption of (local) communities, creating
cascading impacts consisting of short-term impacts as well as long-
lasting economic effects, and in some cases migration. When the
responses of the economic sector to short term weather variations
are applied to long term-climate projections, risks associated with
climate change on different sectors are projected to result in an
average 1.2% of decrease of US GDP per degree Celsius of warming.
Furthermore, broad geographical discrepancies generate a large
transfer of value northwards and westwards with the expected
consequence of increased economic inequality (Hsiang et al. 2017).
The severity and intensity of the cascading impacts also depend
on the affected societies’ vulnerability and resilience. For example,
the intensity and influence of compound events are dependent
on the size and scale of the affected society and the percentage
of economy or GDP impacted (Handmer et al. 2012 in IPCC SREX).
Smaller countries and especially small islands face the challenge of
being unable to ‘hedge’ the risk through geographical redistribution
(see Cross-Chapter Box 9).

"The management of compound events and cascading impacts in
the context of governance poses challenges, partly because it is
place dependent and heavily influenced by local parameters such
as hazard experience and cultural values. Moreover, in some cases,
people perceive that their community or country is less affected than
others, leading to a ‘spatial optimism bias’ that delays or reduces
the scope of actions (Nunn et al. 2016). In other cases it is unclear
who will take responsibility when compound events and cascading
impacts occur (Scolobig, 2017), although for some compound risks
(e.g., na-tech disasters — when natural hazards trigger technological
disasters), the private sector cooperates with governments to
manage and respond to risks (Krausmann et al. 2017). Considerable
variations exist among and inside countries. The level of engagement
depends on the process of cascading impacts and the role of
governance arrangement at the country level (Lawrence et al.
2018), countries’ capacity to develop integrated risk and disaster
frameworks and regulations, viable multi-stakeholder and public-
private partnership in the case of multiple technological and natural
hazards (Gerkensmeier and Ratter, 2018), the initiatives of local
governments to exercise compound risk operations, and experience
in interagency cooperation (Scolobig, 2017). The importance of local
knowledge and traditional practices in disaster risk prevention and
reduction is widely recognised (Hiwasaki et al. 2014; Hilhorst et al.
2015; Audefroy and Sanchez, 2017) (high confidence). The need to
strengthen DRM is evident and can be improved and communicated
effectively by integrating local knowledge such as Inuit’s indigenous
knowledge and local knowledge in Alaska (Pearce et al. 2015; Cross-
Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1) since it is easier for communities to
accept than pure science-based DRM (Ikeda et al. 2016).

The Coral Triangle is under the combined threats of mean warming, ocean acidification, temperature and sea level
variability (often associated with both El Nifio and La Nifia), coastal development and overfishing, leading to reduced
ecosystem services and loss of biodiversity. The Coral Triangle covers 4 million square miles of ocean and coastal waters in
Southeast Asia and the Pacific, in the area surrounding Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Timor Leste and
the Solomon Islands. It is the centre of the highest coastal marine biodiversity in the world due to its geological setting, physical
environment, and an array of ecological and evolutionary processes which makes it a conservation priority. Together with mangroves
and seagrass beds, the 605 species of corals including 15 regional endemics (Veron et al. 2011) provide ecosystem services to over 100

"Risks from compound events include increase in sea surface temperature (SST), SLR and increased human activities. The increasing trend
in SSTs was estimated to be 0.1°C per decade between 1960 and 2007 (Kleypas et al. 2015) but increased to 0.2°C per decade from 1985
to 2006 (Penaflor et al. 2009), an estimation comparable with that in the South China Sea (Zuo et al. 2015). However, waters in
the northern and eastern parts are warming faster than the rest of the region, and this variability is increased by local parameters
linked to the complex bathymetry and oceanography of the region (Kleypas et al. 2015). Areas in the eastern part have experienced
more thermal stress events, and these appear to be more likely during La Nifia events, which generate heat pulses in the region,
leading to bleaching events, some of them already triggered by El Nifio Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. In the Coral Triangle, El
Nifio events have a relative cooling effect, while La Nifia events are accompanied by warming (Penaflor et al. 2009). The 1997-1998
EI Nifio was followed by a strong La Nifia so that degree heating weeks (DHW) values in many parts of the region were greater than
four, which caused widespread coral bleaching (DHW values greater than zero indicate there is thermal stress, while DHW values of
4 and greater indicate the existence of sufficient thermal stress to produce significant levels of coral bleaching; Kayanne, 2017).
However, in Indonesia, the 2015-2016 El Nifio event had impacted shallow water reefs well before high SSTs could trigger any coral
bleaching (Ampou et al. 2017). Sea level in Indonesia had been at its lowest in the past 12 years following this El Nifio event and
this had affected corals living in shallow waters. Substantial mortality was likely caused by higher daily aerial exposure during
low tides and warmer SST associated with shallow waters. Another climate change-associated impact in the Coral Triangle is ocean
acidification. Although less exposed than other reefs at higher latitudes (van Hooidonk et al. 2013), changes in pH are expected to
affect coral calcification (DeCarlo et al. 2017), with an impact on coral reef fisheries (Speers et al. 2016).

was devastated with the release of about 4.6 million pounds of contaminants from petrochemical plants and refineries. Irma caused
44 direct deaths (Cangialosi et al. 2018) and wiped out housing, schools, fisheries and livestock in Barbuda, Antigua, St. Martin
and the British Virgin Islands (ACAPS et al. 2017). Maria caused 31 direct deaths in Dominica, two in Guadeloupe and around 65

of crops in Puerto Rico (Rexach et al. 2017; Rossell6, 2017), and damaged pharmaceutical industries that provided 33% of Puerto
Rico's gross domestic product (GDP) causing shortages of some medical supplies in the USA (Sacks et al. 2018). The effects of Maria
are expected to increase the poverty rate by 14% because of unemployment in tourism and agriculture sectors for more than a year
in Dominica (The Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica, 2017), and resulted in outmigration to neighboring countries or
the USA (ACAPS et al. 2017; Rossellé, 2017). These economic and social consequences are indicative of the cascading impact of the

emergency coordination (Rosselld, 2017; The Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica, 2017).

Efforts in various countries and large cities to improve resilience

network of research, information and best practices (e.g., Aerts et al.
2014). In both northern and southern high latitudes, extreme climatic

human choices. The question is whether responses to extremes

the anticipatory management of adaptation to changes in climate
and weather extremes. While there are several impact studies on
extreme events and abrupt change, very few focus on the necessity of

however, how one can overcome path dependencies which may
cause technical lock-ins in the current system. Monitoring systems
of climatic and derived variables, in order to predict necessary shifts
in adaptation policies are in development (Haasnoot et al. 2015).
However, these frameworks have so far been mostly applied to more
gradual shifts of climate change, rather than extreme events and

adaptation to abrupt change and extreme events incorporates
climate change concerns and the impact of climate extremes on
vulnerable populations taking into account community participation
and local knowledge (Tozier de la Poterie and Baudoin, 2015). These
interventions reduce risk and enhance resilience, and contribute to
the SDGs and social justice (Mal et al. 2018). Temporal scales denote
before and after abrupt changes and extreme events (prevention and

distribute responsibilities between mitigation and adaptation based
on climate justice criteria (Wallimann-Helmer et al. 2019). The Warsaw
International Mechanism on L&D under the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) addresses irreversible

several of the documented and projected irreversible or unavoidable

recourse to believe and evaluate relevant information (Braten et al.

do not prepare for the consequences of extremes (Simpson, 2012;
Edmondson and Levy, 2019), and shift the responsibility to the

"Under the same L&D mechanism, risk transfer mechanisms and
insurance have been suggested as a specific adaptation policy option.
Several forms of ‘climate change’ insurance have been proposed
recently, but their potential for adaptation has met with criticism,
importantly because of the costs of formal insurance and other risk
transfer options, as well as issues with sustainability given the lack
of loss prevention and adaptation (Surminski et al. 2016; Linnerooth-
Bayer et al. 2019). A compensation mechanism for low-lying small
islands inclusive of L&D proposal is in progress (Adelman, 2016).
Insurance (see also Section 4.4.4) can help absorb extreme shocks for
both individuals, using traditional insurance and parametric insurance.
Sovereign insurance mechanisms can help governments absorb large
losses (Linnerooth-Bayer et al. 2019), but eventually they need to
be coupled with other incentives for adaptation and risk reduction
measures to be cost-effective (Botzen, 2013) (medium confidence).

indicate that climate adaptation and mitigation plans’ treatment

Moreover, risk communication with the public is part of an integrated
disaster warning system, but behavioural response to disaster
warnings are often governed by personal beliefs about the nature of
the hazard; and ultimately swaying individual decisions to comply with
or ignore the warning message (Mayhorn and McLaughlin, 2014).

economic benefits, although there is medium evidence about the
range of the estimated benefits which varies from a global estimate
of two to four dollars saved for each dollar invested (Kull et al. 2013;
Mechler, 2016) to about 400 EUR per invested 1 EUR in the case
of flood early warning systems in Europe (Pappenberger et al.
2015). The US Federal Emergency Management Agency indicated
that a 1% increase in annual investment in flood management
decreases flood damage by 2.1% (Davlasheridze et al. 2017).
Conserving ecosystems that provide services for risk reduction also
has monetary benefits. Wetlands have been observed to reduce
damages during storms. Wetlands and floodplains in Otter Creek
(Vermont, USA) reduced damages caused by storms by 54-78% and
84-95%, respectively, for Tropical Storm Irene (Watson et al. 2016).
For the whole of the USA, wetlands provide 23.2 billion USD yr“!
in storm protection services and the loss of 1 hectare of wetland is
estimated to correspond to an average 33,000 USD increase in storm
damage from specific storms (Costanza et al. 2008). Engineered
structures are also expected to reduce risks. In Europe, to maintain
the coastal flood loss constant relative to the size of the economy,
flood defence structures need to be able to protect coastal areas for
a projected increase of sea level between 0.5-2.5 m. Without these
risk reduction actions, the expected damages from coastal floods
could increase by two or three degrees of magnitude compared to
the present (Vousdoukas et al. 2018). Although risk reduction actions
are generally considered an effective way to reduce the damages by
shifting the loss-exceedance curve, cost-benefit analysis of disaster
risk reduction actions faces several challenges, including its limited
role in informing decisions, spatial and temporal uncertainty scales,
and discounting and choice of discount rate that affect cost-benefit
analysis results heavily (Mechler, 2016).

and perspectives on these categories, and they can change over time
(Plummer et al. 2017; see Cross-Chapter Boxes 1 and 2 in Chapter 1).
Transformative governance embraces a wider application of climate
change-induced mitigation and adaptation strategies to generate
fundamental change. It is society-wide and goes beyond the goals
of climate change policies and measures (IPCC, 2013; Patterson et al.
2018). It is distinguished from conventional strategies and solutions,
as it includes both natural and human systems and intertwines with
the SDGs (Fleurbaey et al. 2014; Tabara et al. 2019). Transformational
adaptation is also needed when incremental adaptation to extreme
events and abrupt changes is insufficient (Kates et al. 2012).
Planned retreat from SLR and climate refugees illustrate the need for
transformative governance as the current coastal and risk management
regimes do not have the capacity to handle these issues adequately.
Inclusion of bilateral and regional agreements related to climate-
induced migration (McAdam, 2011), land use planning frameworks to
respond to policy, institutional and cultural implications of migration

for migrants to diversify income and avoid being in harm's way
(Gemenne, 2015) are steps towards transformative governance.
Retreat and migration entail local responses that include indigenous

these issues (Farbotko and Lazrus, 2012; Hilhorst et al. 2015; Tharakan,
2015; lloka, 2016; Nunn et al. 2016; see also Cross-Chapter Boxes 2

started to pursue transformative governance given the potential for
increased tourism and cooperation that require changed governance

"Climate change is projected to influence extreme events and to potentially cause abrupt changes in the ocean
and the cryosphere. Both these phenomena can add to the other, slow-onset impacts of climate change, such as
a global warming or sea level rise (SLR). In addition, abrupt changes can be tipping points, bringing the ocean,
cryosphere, as well as their ecosystems, or the whole climate system, to new conditions instead or going back to
the ones prevailing before the abrupt change.
"	Text
"In the ocean, a possible abrupt change is associated with an interruption of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning
Circulation (AMOC), an important component of global ocean circulation. A slowdown of the AMOC could
have consequences around the world: rainfall in the Sahel region could reduce, hampering crop production;
the summer monsoon in Asia could weaken; regional SLR could increase around the Atlantic, and there might
be more winter storms in Europe. The collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is considered to be one of
the tipping points for the global climate. Such an event can be triggered when ice shelves break and ice flows
towards the ocean. While, in general, it is difficult to assess the probability of occurrence of abrupt climate
events they are physically plausible events that could cause large impacts on ecosystems and societies and may
be irreversible.

"Reducing GHG emissions is the main action to limit global warming to acceptable levels and reduce the
occurrence of extreme events and abrupt changes. However, in addition to mitigation, a variety of measures
and risk management strategies supports adaptation to future risks. Future risks linked to abrupt changes
are strongly influenced by local conditions and different characteristics of the events themselves and evolve
differently depending on the circumstances. One major factor for adaptation is whether the extreme events
will simply amplify the known impacts or whether they will cause completely new conditions, which may be
related to a tipping point. Another essential factor is whether an extreme event or abrupt change will happen
in isolation or in conjunction with other events, in a chain of cascading impacts or as part of a compound risk
where several events happen at the same time so that impacts can multiply each other. Also, impacts are heavily
aggravated by increasing exposure and changes in vulnerability, for example reducing the availability of food,
water and energy supply, and not just the occurrence of extremes themselves.

"Successful management of extreme events and abrupt changes in the ocean and cryosphere involves all available
resources and governance approaches, including among others land-use and spatial planning, indigenous

sustainable use of resources and the recognition of the value of ecosystem services. There are three general
approaches that, alone or in combination, can enable communities to adapt to these events: retreat from the
area, accommodation to new conditions and protection. All have advantages and limitations and their success
will depend on the specific circumstances and the community’s level of adaptability. But only transformative
governance that integrates a variety of strategies and benefits from institutional change helps to address
larger risks posed by compound events. Integrating risk-reduction approaches into institutional practices and
inclusive decision making that builds on the respective competences of different government agencies and other

"Detection, attribution and projection of physical aspects of climate
change at regional and local scales are generally limited by
uncertainties in the response of climate models to changes in GHGs

reflecting the lack of capacity or imperative by regional and national
technical institutions to undertake such studies. Thermodynamic
aspects of change may be more robust than those involving changes
in dynamics e.g., the tracks of TCs or ocean dynamical components of
MHW formation. Increasing resolution and improvements in climate
models may help to reduce uncertainty. However, because extreme

"LLIC include a wide diversity of systems (Figure CB9.1). Relevant regions occur on both islands and continents from the
tropics to the poles, and support urban and rural societies from across the development spectrum (including SIDS and Least
Developed Countries (LDCs)). LLIC host around 11% of the global population (Neumann et al., 2015), and generate about
14% of the global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (Kummu et al., 2016). This integrative Cross-Chapter Box focuses on the
array of challenges created by the melting of the cryosphere and the changing ocean, described throughout the report,

LLIC are already experiencing the impacts of climate-related changes to the ocean and cryosphere, for both extreme events
and slow onset changes (Sections 4.3.3, 5.3.1 to 5.3.6, 6.2, 6.8, 6.9), due to their low elevation, narrow ecological zonation,
climate sensitive ecosystems and natural resources, as well as increasing anthropogenic pressures (Sections 1.5, 4.3.2).
High levels of impacts to coastal morphology, ecosystems and dependent human communities are detectable today and
disproportionately higher risks are expected in the course of the 21st century (medium evidence, high agreement) (Sections
4.3.4, 5.3.7), even under a low emission pathway compatible with a 1.5°C global warming (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018; IPCC,
2018). The magnitude of projected impacts (ie., risks; Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1) will depend on future greenhouse
gas emissions and the associated climate changes, as well as on other drivers such as population movement into risk-prone
areas and societal efforts to adapt.

"Ocean and cryosphere changes already impact Low-Lying Islands and Coasts (LLIC), including Small
Island Developing States (SIDS), with cascading and compounding risks. Disproportionately higher risks
are expected in the course of the 21st century. Reinforcing the findings of the IPCC Special Report on
Global Warming of 1.5°C, vulnerable human communities, especially those in coral reef environments and polar
regions, may exceed adaptation limits well before the end of this century and even in a low greenhouse gas
emission pathway (high confidence'). Depending on the effectiveness of 21st century mitigation and adaptation
pathways under all emission scenarios, most of the low-lying regions around the world may face adaptation
limits beyond 2100, due to the long-term commitment of sea level rise (medium confidence). LLIC host around
11% of the global population, generate about 14% of the global Gross Domestic Product and comprise many world cultural
heritage sites. LLIC already experience climate-related ocean and cryosphere changes (high confidence), and they share both
commonalities in their exposure and vulnerability to climate change (e.g., low elevation, human disturbances to terrestrial
and marine ecosystems), and context-specificities (e.g., variable ecosystem climate sensitivities and risk perceptions by
populations). Options to adapt to rising seas, e.g., range from hard engineering to ecosystem-based measures, and from
securing current settings to relocating people, built assets and activities. Effective combinations of measures vary across
geographies (cities and megacities, small islands, deltas and Arctic coasts), and reflect the scale of observed and projected
impacts, ecosystems’ and societies’ adaptive capacity, and the existence of transformational governance (high confidence)

Climate-related hazards — LLIC are subject to the same climate-related hazards as other islands and coasts (overview in Wong
et al., 2014), for both extreme events, for example, marine heat waves, tropical and extratropical storms, associated storm
surges, and heavy precipitation; and slow onset changes, for example, retreat of glaciers and ice sheets, sea ice and
permafrost thaw, sea level rise, and ocean warming and acidification (Sections 1.4, 2.2, 3.2 to 3.4, 4.2, 5.2, 6.2 to 6.6,
Box 6.1). Table CB9.1 summarises the SROCC updates of these hazards, which often combine to explain part of observed
climate impacts and projected risks. For example, accelerating sea level rise will combine with storm surges, tides and
waves to generate to extreme sea level events that affect flooding (Section 4.3.3.2), shoreline changes (Section 4.3.3.3) and
salinisation of soils, groundwater and surface waters (Section 4.3.3.4). Sea level rise will also combine with ocean warming to
accelerate permafrost thawing in the Arctic (Sections 3.4.1.2, 3.4.2.2). Ocean acidification will combine with ocean warming
and deoxygenation to impact benthic and pelagic organisms, associated ecosystems (e.g., coral reefs, oyster beds) and top
predators, with subsequent impacts on species’ abundance and distribution, and the ecosystem services benefiting human
societies (Sections 4.3.3.5, 5.2.2, 5.3.1 to 5.3.6, 5.4.1, 6.4.2, 6.5.2, 6.6.2, 6.7.2, 6.8.2). Importantly, LLIC are at risk for
multi-metre sea level rise projected post-2100 under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)8.5 and restricted to 1-2
m in 2300 under RCP2.6 (Section 4.2.3.5).

2015). Properties are also at risk of losing value due to coastal landscape degradation (McNamara and Keeler, 2013; Fu et al.,

local employment (Rubin and Hilton, 1996).

and Lall, 2015), but also in important effects on supply chains across the globe (Abe and Ye, 2013). Urbanisation could,
however, also provide opportunities for risk reduction, given that cities are centres of innovation, political attention and

Coastal cities and megacities — Coastal cities, especially megacities with over 10 million inhabitants, are at serious risk from
climate-related ocean and cryosphere changes (Abadie, 2018). Over half of today’s global population lives in cities and
megacities, many of which are located in LLIC, including New York City, Tokyo, Jakarta, Mumbai, Shanghai, Lagos and Cairo
(Figure CB9.1). Without substantial adaptation interventions, and based on the compounding effects of future growth in
population and assets, sea level rise and continued subsidence, future flood losses in the 136 largest coastal cities are
projected to rise from 6 billion USD yr“ at present to 1 trillion USD yr in 2050 (Hallegatte et al., 2013; Sections 4.3.3.2
and 6.3.3). In addition to important impacts on coastal megacities and large port cities, small and mid-sized cities are also
considered highly vulnerable because of fast growth rates and low political, human and financial capacities for risk reduction
compared to larger cities (Birkmann et al., 2016; Box 4.2).
"	Text
"Highly context-specific territorial and societal dynamics have resulted in major changes at the coast, for instance the growing
concentration of people and assets in risk prone coastal areas (Section 4.3.2.2), and the degradation of coastal ecosystem
services such as coastal protection and healthy conditions for coastal fisheries and aquaculture (Section 4.3.2.3, 5.4.1.3,
5.4.2.2.2). Local drivers of exposure and vulnerability include, for example, coastal squeeze, inadequate land use planning,
changes in construction modes, sand mining and unsustainable resource extraction (e.g., in the Comoros; Betzold and
Mohamed, 2016; Ratter et al., 2016), as well as loss of Indigenous Knowledge and Local Knowledge (IK and LK; Cross-Chapter
Box 4 in Chapter 1). For example, the loss of IK and LK-based practices and associated cultural heritage limits both the ability
to recognise and respond to ocean and cryosphere related risk and the empowerment of local communities (high confidence)
(Section 4.3.2.4.2). Population growth in medium-to-mega coastal cities is also of concern. For the year 2000, the Low
Elevation Coastal Zones (LECZ, highest elevation up to 10 m above sea level) were estimated to host around 625 million
people (Lichter et al., 2011; Neumann et al., 2015), with the vast majority (517 million) living in non-developed contexts.
By 2100, the LECZ population may increase to as much as 1.14 billion under a Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) where
countries focus on domestic, or even regional issues (SSP3; Jones and O'Neill, 2016). Poor planning can combine with coastal
population growth and climate-related ocean change to create maladaptation (Juhola et al., 2016; Magnan et al., 2016).

"Deltas — \n a context of natural subsidence exacerbated by high human disturbances to sediment supply, for example, due
to fresh water exploitation or damming and land use change upstream from the coast (Kondolf et al., 2014), marine flooding
is already affecting deltas around the world (Brown et al., 2018; Section 4.3.3.4, Box 4.1). An estimated 260,000 km? of delta
area have been temporarily submerged over the 1990s—2000s (Syvitski et al., 2009; Wong et al., 2014). The recurrence of El
Nifio associated floods in the San Juan River delta, Colombia, led to the relocation of several villages, including El Choncho,
San Juan de la Costa, Charambira and Togoroma (Correa and Gonzalez, 2000). The intrusion of saline or brackish water due
to relative sea level rise in combination with storm surges and natural and human-induced subsidence, results in increasing
residual salinity, as already reported in the Delaware Estuary, USA (Ross et al., 2015), in the Ebro Delta, Spain (Genua-Olmedo
et al., 2016) and in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam (Smajgl et al, 2015; Gugliotta et al., 2017). This affects livelihoods, for
example., freshwater fish habitat in Bangladesh (Dasgupta et al., 2017; Section 4.3.3.4.2). Increased salinity limits drinking
water supply (Wilbers et al., 2014), with associated repercussions for the abundance and toxicity of cholera vibrio (Vibrio
cholerae) as shown in the Ganges Delta (Batabyal et al., 2014). Local agriculture is also at risk. Oilseed, sugarcane and jute

"impact of TCs, storm surge and ocean acidification in small islands contributing to loss and damage (Moser and Hart, 2015;
Noy and Edmonds, 2016). For example, Category 5 TC Pam devastated Vanuatu in 2015 with 449.4 million USD in losses for
an economy with a GDP of 758 million USD (Government of Vanuatu, 2015; Handmer and Iveson, 2017). Kiribati, Papua New
Guinea, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu were all impacted by the TC Pam system (IFRC, 2018). In 2016, TC Winston caused 43
deaths in Fiji and losses of more than one third of the GDP (Government of Fiji, 2016; Cox et al., 2018). In 2017, Hurricanes
Maria and Irma swept through 15 Caribbean countries, causing major damages and casualties across numerous islands.
Rebuilding in three countries alone — Dominica, Barbuda and the British Virgin Islands — will cost an estimated 5 billion USD
(UNDP, 2017). The Post-Disaster Needs Assessment for Dominica concluded that hurricane Maria resulted in total damages
amounting to 226% of 2016 GDP (The Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica, 2017). In 2018, Category 4 TC Gita
struck the Pacific islands of Eua and Tongatapu, impacting 80% of the population of Tonga through destruction of buildings,
crops and infrastructure, and resulting in 165 million USD of losses with a national GDP of 461 million USD (Government of
Tonga, 2018). Effective early warning systems, in some Caribbean islands, have reduced the impact (WMO, 2018). Projected
changes in extreme weather include increased intensity of TCs with increased wind speed and rainfall, together with reduced
translational speed creating greater destruction from individual storms and counteracting the decreased frequency of

"SIDS are home to 65 million people (UN-OHRLLS, 2015). More than 80% of small island residents live near the coast where
flooding and coastal erosion already pose serious problems (Nurse et al., 2014) and since the IPCC 5th Assessment Report
(AR5) and the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5), there is consensus on the increasing threats to island
sustainability in terms of land, soils and freshwater availability. As a result, there is growing concern that some island nations
as a whole may become uninhabitable due to rising sea levels and climate change, with implications for relocation, sovereignty
and statehood (Burkett, 2011; Gerrard and Wannier, 2013; Yamamoto and Esteban, 2014; Donner, 2015). For example, at the
island scale, recent studies (e.g., on Roi-Namur Island, Marshall Islands; Storlazzi et al., 2018) estimate some atoll islands to
become uninhabitable before the middle of the 21st century due to the exacerbation of wave-driven flooding by sea level
rise, compromising soil fertility and the integrity of freshwater lenses (Cheriton et al., 2016). The literature also discusses the
future of atoll island shoreline. Atoll islands are not ‘static landforms’ (high confidence) and they experience both erosion
(Section 4.3.3.3) and accretion of land. In the Solomon Islands, where rates of sea level rise exceed the global average at
7-10 mm yr"" (Becker et al., 2012), a study of 33 reef islands showed five vegetated islands had disappeared and six islands
were concerned with severe shoreline erosion (Albert et al., 2016). In Micronesia, a study showed the disappearance of
several reef islands, severe erosion in leeward reef edge islands and coastal expansion in mangrove areas (Nunn et al., 2017).
In Tuvalu, with sea level rise of ~15 cm between 1971 and 2014, small islands decreased in land area while larger populated
islands maintained or increased land area with the exception of the remote island of Nanumea (Kench et al., 2018). Positive
shoreline and surface area changes over the recent decades to century have been observed for atoll islands in the Pacific
and Indian oceans (McLean and Kench, 2015; Albert et al., 2016; Kench et al., 2018; Duvat, 2019). Out of 709 islands studied,
73.1% had stable surface area, 15.5% increased and 11.4% decreased in size over the last 40-70 years (Duvat, 2019). It has,
however, been argued that the capacity of some atoll islands to maintain their land area by naturally adjusting to sea level
rise could be reduced in the coming decades (/ow evidence, high agreement). Indeed, the projected combination of higher
rates of sea level rise (Sections 4.2.3.2, 4.2.3.3 and 4.2.3.5), increased wave energy (Albert et al., 2016; see also Section 6.3),
changes in storm wave direction (Harley et al, 2017), as well as the impacts of ocean warming and acidification on the reef
system (Quataert et al., 2015; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018), is expected to shift the balance towards more frequent flooding
and increased erosion (Sections 4.3.3, 5.3.3).

"Risks to Arctic coasts will be reinforced by anthropogenic drivers originating in the recent decades of history (e.g., socioeconomic
adjustments after government policies requiring children to attend school) which resulted in the construction of infrastructure
in near-shore areas. While risk levels vary by village, in several cases infrastructure has been lost and subsistence use areas
modified (Gorokhovich et al., 2013; Marino, 2015). More broadly, in the Arctic, ‘indigenous peoples (...) have been pushed

"Considering a sea level rise scenario range of 25-123 cm — all RCPs; wider range of sea level rise scenarios than the /ikely
range of AR5 but relatively consistent with the range of projections assessed in this report (Section 4.2.3.2) - and no
adaptation, Hinkel et al. (2014) estimated annual losses from future marine flooding to amount to 0.3—9.3% of global GDP in
2100. Noteworthy, coastal protection will inevitably have economic costs (DiSegni and Shechter, 2013), whether it involves
hard coastal protection (Hinkel et al., 2018), ecosystem-based approaches (Narayan et al., 2016; Pontee et al., 2016) or
a combination of both (Schoonees et al., 2019). Coastal agriculture (e.g., rice crops; Smajgl et al., 2015; Genua-Olmedo et al.,
2016), and fisheries and aquaculture will also be seriously impacted (Sections 4.3.3.6.1, 4.3.3.6.3, 5.4.1). For example, it is
expected that the marine fisheries revenues of 89% of the world’s fishing countries will be negatively affected by mid-century
under RCP8.5 (Hilmi et al, 2015). The fact that more than 90% of the world’s rural poor are located in the LECZ of 15
developing countries (Barbier, 2015) and that these regions are highly dependent on fish for their dietary consumption, raises

"Arctic coasts — Climate-related ocean and cryosphere changes combine to negatively impact not only the economy
and life-styles of the Arctic coastal communities, but also the local cultural identity, self-sufficiency, IK and LK and related
skills (Lacher, 2015; Sections 3.4.3, 4.3.2.4.2). Changes in fish and seabird populations amplified by climate change have an
impact on ecosystems and livelihoods in Arctic island communities such as in Norway's Lofoten archipelago (Dannevig and
Hovelsrud, 2016; Kaltenborn et al., 2017). Another concern relates to coastal erosion, for example triggered by permafrost
thaw (Giinther et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2018), and which already affects 178 Alaskan communities, with 26 in a very critical
situation, such as Newtok, Shishmaref, Kivilina and northwestern coastal communities on the Chukchi Sea (Bronen and
Chapin III, 2013). Noteworthy, erosion does not affect all Arctic coastlines: many of them are located in areas that experience
rapid glacial-isostatic adjustment (GIA) uplift James et al., 2015; Forbes et al., 2018) and have low sensitivity to extreme sea
levels and sea level rise. An additional factor unique to the Arctic coasts compared to other LLIC is the decrease in seasonal
sea ice extent (Section 3.2.1, 4.3.4.2.1), that both reduces the physical protection of the land (Overeem et al., 2011; Fang
et al., 2018), for example, from wave action, and allows for greater open water fetch producing stronger wind-generated
waves in the open water (Lantuit et al., 2011). In combination with a decreased stability of permafrost — another specificity
of polar regions (Romanovsky et al., 2010) — and sea level rise, seasonal sea ice extent reduction results in shoreline erosion
(Gibbs and Richmond, 2017; Jones et al., 2018), with associated impacts on coastal settlements (Table 3.4). However, as
mentioned above, local geomorphology and geology in the Arctic is as important as permafrost and sea ice extent for
determining current and future erosion (Lantuit et al., 2011).

(e.g., seawalls, groynes, revetments and rip-raps), soft engineering (e.g., beach nourishment and dune restoration), reclamation
works to build new lands seaward and upwards, ecosystem-based measures (e.g., vegetation planting and coral farming),
community-based approaches (e.g., social networks, education campaigns and economic diversification) and institutional
innovations (e.g., marine protected areas and evacuation plans). The effectiveness of the measures to reduce risks depends
on both local context-specificities (Gattuso et al., 2018) and the magnitude and timing of local climate impacts. However,
there is still a gap in on-the-ground evidence, good practices and guidelines to evaluate the observed and projected benefits
of each type of measures applied in various contexts, for example, to decide whether nature-based options represent low- to

"Coastal tourism could be affected in various ways by ocean- and cryosphere-related changes (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018;

and snorkelling), Chen et al. (2015) estimated that the global economic impact of the expected decline in reef coverage
(between 6.6 and 27.6% under RCPs 2.6 and 8.5, respectively) will range from 1.9 to 12.0 billion USD yr-"". The future appeal
of tourism destinations will partly depend on sea surface temperature, including induced effects such as an increase in
invasive species, e.g., jellyfishes (Burge et al., 2014; Weatherdon et al., 2016) and lion fish in the Northwest Atlantic, the Gulf
of Mexico and the Caribbean (Albins, 2015; Johnston et al., 2015; Holdschlag and Ratter, 2016). It will also depend on how
tourists and tourism developers perceive the risks induced by ocean-related changes (e.g., Shakeela et al., 2013; Davidson
and Sahli, 2015). This will combine with the influence of changes in climatic conditions in tourists’ areas of origin (Bujosa
and Rosselld, 2013; Amelung and Nicholls, 2014; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018) and of non-climatic components such as

"Protection with hard coastal defences is commonly used to prevent inundation from extreme water levels and wave overtopping
(Section 4.4.2.2). In environments such as megacities, adequately engineered hard coastal defences are considered to be
successful options and an efficient adaptation option in the long run (Hinkel et al., 2018). However, such measures can
also lead to detrimental effects, such as erosion exacerbation by seawalls reflecting wave energy and jetties disrupting
cross-shore sediment transport. Adaptation labelled measures ‘may [thus] lead to increased risk of adverse climate-related
outcomes, increased vulnerability to climate change, or diminished welfare’ (Noble et al., 2014: 857) and therefore be
maladaptive (Barnett and O'Neill, 2013; Juhola et al., 2016; Magnan et al., 2016). As a result, alternatives have emerged,
such as ecosystem-based design measures including coconut fibre blankets (David et al., 2016), plantations of seagrass (Paul
and Gillis, 2015), artificial reefs made from bio-rock materials (Beetham et al., 2017; Goreau and Prong, 2017) and bamboo
breakwaters (David et al., 2016). While restoration operations are often rather associated to conservation practices, they
can have co-benefits in terms of coastal protection services (Section 4.3.2.3). For example, soft protection systems used in
69 studies were found to exhibit effectiveness in reducing wave heights at 70% for coral reefs, 62-79% for salt marshes,
36% for seagrass meadows and 31% for mangroves (Narayan et al., 2016). Arguing that coral reefs can provide comparably
higher wave attenuation benefits to artificial defences such as breakwaters, Ferrario et al. (2014) conclude that reef defences
for reducing coastal hazards can be enhanced cost effectively on the order of 1/10th. Coral reefs are, however, at very
high risk from climate change (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018; Section 5.3.4), which challenges the duration of such benefits.

"Ecosystem-based measures, if applied place specific and adequate — for example, use of indigenous rather than exotic species
(e.g., Duvat et al., 2016) —, are usually considered low-regret in that they can stabilise the coastal vegetation and protect
against coastal hazards, while at the same time enhancing the adaptive capacity of natural ecosystems (medium evidence,

high agreement) (Schoonees et al., 2019; Sections 2.3.3.4, 5.5.2, 6.9).

"Participatory scenario building processes, collaborative landscape planning and co-design of ecosystem-based management for
LLIC resilience are underway along with promising approaches to actively engage all levels of society in the exploration of
future adaptation scenarios. Experiences are reported for the German North Sea coast (Karrasch et al., 2017), Tenerife Island
in the Atlantic Ocean (Hernandez-Gonzalez et al., 2016) and Pacific island communities (Burnside-Lawry et al., 2017). While
adaptation labelled measures currently applied ‘on the ground’ are mainly reactive and short-term, long-term approaches
are emerging (Noble et al., 2014; Wong et al., 2014), as illustrated by the development of ‘adaptation pathways’ — that is,
long-term adaptation strategies based upon decision cycles that, over time, explore and sequence a set of possible actions
based on alternative external, uncertain developments (Haasnoot et al., 2013; Barnett et al, 2014; Wise et al., 2014; Werners
et al., 2015; Hermans et al., 2017; Section 4.4.4.3.4). Key expected benefits are an improved consideration of both the
evolving nature of vulnerability (Denton et al., 2014; Dilling et al., 2015; Duvat et al, 2017; Fawcett et al, 2017) and climate
change uncertainty (O’Brien et al., 2012; Brown et al., 2014; Noble et al., 2014), as well as better anticipation of the risks of
maladaptation (Magnan et al., 2016). Practical applications of adaptation pathways in LLIC are occurring, for example, in

"For all interventions, adaptation is fully recognised as being a societal challenge, and not merely a question of technological
solutions (medium evidence, high agreement) (Jones and Clark, 2014; McCubbin et al., 2015; Gerkensmeier and Ratter,
2018). Enhancing adaptation implies various sociopolitical and economic framings, coping capacities and cross-scale social
and economic impacts (Sections 4.4.3, 4.4.5, Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1). As a result, community-based decision
making, sustainable spatial planning and new institutional arrangements gain increasing attention (Sections 4.4.4). Such
approaches can involve working with local informal and formal institutions (Barron et al., 2012), enhancing risk ownership
by communities through participative approaches (McEwen et al., 2017), establishing collaborative community networks
(Hernandez-Gonzalez et al., 2016), and better integrating LLIC communities’ IK and LK (see McMillen et al., 2014; Cross-Chapter
Box 4 in Chapter 1). Small island communities, in particular, can strengthen their adaptive capacities by building on relatively
high degrees of social capital, that is, dense social networks, collective action, reciprocity and relations of trust (Petzold and
Ratter, 2015; Barnett and Waters, 2016; Petzold, 2016; Kelman, 2017; Section 4.3.2.4.3). The aim of all these approaches is
both to facilitate the effective implementation of adaptive action, and create widespread acceptance of adaptation policies
by stakeholders and local populations.

"While human migration and relocation are expected to be a growing challenge for LLIC (medium evidence, high agreement)
(Adger et al., 2014; Birk and Rasmussen, 2014; Milan and Ruano, 2014; Thomas, 2015; Sections 3.5.3.5, 4.4.2.4, 6.3.4,
Table 3.4; Hajra et al, 2017; Stojanov et al. 2017), recent studies advocate for considering these options as adaptation to
climate-related changes in the ocean and cryosphere (Shayegh et al., 2016; Allgood and McNamara, 2017; Hauer, 2017;
Morrison, 2017; Perumal, 2018; Section 4.4.2.4). Such a view is, however, convoyed by discussions on related costs and
impacts on the wellbeing of the people who are relocated (Null and Herzer Risi, 2016). Coastal retreat is underway in various
LLIC around the world, for example, in Alaska and the US (Bronen, 2015; Ford et al., 2015; Logan et al., 2016; Hino et al.,
2017), Guatemala (Milan and Ruano, 2014), Western Colombia (Correa and Gonzalez, 2000), the Caribbean (Apgar et al.,
2015; Rivera-Collazo et al., 2015) and Vietnam (Collins et al., 2017). Noteworthy, environmentally-induced relocation is not
necessarily new, for example, in the Pacific (Nunn, 2014; Boege, 2016). The Gilbertese people from Kiribati moved to the
Solomon Islands during the 1950s—1960s, as a result of long periodic droughts and subsequent environmental degradation
(Birk and Rasmussen, 2014; Albert et al., 2016; Tabe, 2016; Weber, 2016). In the Solomon Islands, the relocation of the Taro
Township (Choiseul Province) as a result of rising sea level and coastal erosion is already underway (Haines and McGuire, 2014;
Haines, 2016). In Fiji, the relocation of Vunidogoloa village as a result of sea level rise and coastal erosion was successfully
carried out in 2014 (McNamara and Des Combes, 2015). In Alaska, some communities (e.g., Newtok) responded to changing
environmental and livelihood conditions due to permafrost thaw with self-initiated relocation efforts. Subsequently, Alaska
state funding has been allocated to assist them (Bronen, 2015; Hamilton et al., 2016). Conflict escalation is a serious concern
in the resettlement areas, between newcomers and locals, or between different groups of newcomers, particularly under
conditions of land scarcity, high population density and (perceived) inequality (Connell and Lutkehaus, 2017; Boege, 2018).
The obstacles thus extend well beyond the cost of relocation itself because of the multi-dimensional impacts on people's
lives. Relocation also concerns economic activities, as illustrated with shellfish aquaculture relocation in the west coast of the
US due to ocean acidification-driven crises (Cooley et al., 2016).

LLIC are particularly at risk from climate-related changes to the ocean and the cryosphere, whether they are urban or
rural, continental or island, at any latitude and regardless of level of development (high confidence). Over the course of the
21st century, they are expected to experience both increasing risks (high confidence) and limits to ecological and societal
adaptation (de Coninck et al., 2018; Djalante et al., 2018; Section 4.3.4.2, Figure 6.2, Figure CB9.2; Hoegh-Guldberg et al.,
2018), which has the potential to significantly increase the level of loss and damage experienced by local coastal livelihoods
(eg., fishing, logistics or tourism) (Djalante et al., 2018). However, there are still important research gaps on residual risks and
adaptation limits, given that these limits can be reached due to the intensity of the hazards and/or to the high vulnerability
of a given system, and can be ecological, technological, economic, social, cultural, political or institutional. In addition, ocean
and cryosphere changes have the potential to accumulate in compound events and cause cascades of impacts through
economic, environmental and social processes (medium evidence, high agreement) (Sections 6.8.2 to 6.8.3, Box 6.1). This is
the case when coastal flooding and riverine inundation occur together, for example, during the 2012 Superstorm Sandy in
New York City, USA (Rosenzweig and Solecki, 2014); the 2014 cyclone Bejisa in Reunion Island, France (Duvat et al., 2016),
and the 2017 Hurricane Harvey in Houston, USA (Emanuel, 2017). Cascade effects far beyond the extent of the original
impacts bring the risk in LLIC of slowing down and reversing overall development achievements, particularly on poverty
reduction (low evidence, medium agreement) (Hallegatte et al., 2016). Global time series analysis of risk and vulnerability
trends show that many Pacific island states have fallen behind the global average in terms of progress made in the reduction
of social vulnerability towards natural hazards over the past years (Feldmeyer et al., 2017). These findings may well be
indicative of the situation for other LLIC (medium confidence) (Hay et al., 2019).

"protection and ecosystem-based adaptation will reach significant limits by 2100 in the case of a 1 m rise in sea level,
suggesting the need for research into the crossing of environmental and/or anthropogenic tipping points (Sections 6.2).
The SROCC report confirms that high risk to various geographies (Arctic communities remote from regions of rapid positive
glacial-isostatic adjustment, megacities, urban atoll islands and large tropical agricultural deltas) are to be expected before
a 1m rise in global mean sea level (Section 4.3.4.2.1). More broadly, this report suggests, first, that the drivers and timing
of the future habitability of LLIC will vary from one case to another (Manley et al, 2016; Hay et al, 2018). Second, future
storylines of risks will also critically depend on the multi-decadal effectiveness of coastal nations’ and communities’ responses
(medium evidence, high agreement). This will, in turn, partly depend on transformation of risk management regimes in order
to harness these potentials and shift course towards climate-resilient development pathways (low evidence, high agreement)
(Solecki et al., 2017).

"for at least several hours. The term aerosol, which includes both the
particles and the suspending gas, is often used in this Special Report
in its plural form to mean ‘aerosol particles’. Aerosols may be of either
natural or anthropogenic origin. Aerosols can influence climate in
several ways: directly through scattering and absorbing radiation, and
indirectly by acting as cloud condensation nuclei or ice nuclei, modifying
the optical properties and lifetime of clouds or upon deposition
on snow or ice-covered surfaces thereby altering their albedo and
contributing to climate feedback. Atmospheric aerosols, whether natural
or anthropogenic, originate from two different pathways: emissions of
primary particulate matter (PM), and formation of secondary PM from
gaseous precursors. The bulk of aerosols are of natural origin. Some
scientists use group labels that refer to the chemical composition, namely:
sea salt, organic carbon, black carbon (BC), mineral species (mainly
desert dust), sulphate, nitrate and ammonium. These labels are, however,
imperfect as aerosols combine particles to create complex mixtures. See
also Short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs).

Coastal blue carbon focuses on rooted vegetation in the coastal zone,
such as tidal marshes, mangroves and seagrasses. These ecosystems
have high carbon burial rates on a per unit area basis and accumulate
carbon in their soils and sediments. They provide many non-climatic
benefits and can contribute to ecosystem-based adaptation. If degrad-

their carbon back to the atmosphere. There is current debate regard-

A change in the state of the climate that can be identified (e.g., by
using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variability
of its properties and that persists for an extended period, typically
decades or longer. Climate change may be due to natural internal
processes or external forcings such as modulations of the solar cycles,
volcanic eruptions and persistent anthropogenic changes in the
composition of the atmosphere or in /and use. Note that the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in
its Article 1, defines climate change as: ‘a change of climate which
is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the
composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to
natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods’.
The UNFCCC thus makes a distinction between climate change
attributable to human activities altering the atmospheric composition
and climate variability attributable to natural causes. See also G/obal

used in this Special Report. (1) In the United Nations (UN) system, there
is no established convention for the designation of developed and

developed and developing regions based on common practice. In
addition, specific countries are designated as least developed countries,
landlocked developing countries, sail island developing states (SIDS),
and transition economies. Many countries appear in more than one of
these categories. (3) The World Bank uses income as the main criterion
for classifying countries as low, lower middle, upper middle, and high
income. (4) The UN Development Programme (UNDP) aggregates
indicators for life expectancy, educational attainment, and income
into a single composite Human Development Index (HDI) to classify
countries as low, medium, high, or very high human development.

"The term El Nifio was initially used to describe a warm-water
current that periodically flows along the coast of Ecuador and
Peru, disrupting the local fishery. It has since become identified
with warming of the tropical Pacific Ocean east of the dateline.
This oceanic event is associated with a fluctuation of a global-
scale tropical and subtropical surface pressure pattern called the
Southern Oscillation. This coupled atmosphere-ocean phenomenon,
with preferred time scales of two to about seven years, is known
as the El Nifio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). It is often measured by
the surface pressure anomaly difference between Tahiti and Darwin
and/or the sea surface temperatures (SST) in the central and eastern
equatorial Pacific. During an ENSO event, the prevailing trade
winds weaken, reducing upwelling and altering ocean currents
such that the SSTs warm, further weakening the trade winds. This
phenomenon has a great impact on the wind, SST and precipitation
patterns in the tropical Pacific. It has climatic effects throughout
the Pacific region and in many other parts of the world, through
global te/econnections. The cold phase of ENSO is called La Nifia.

"An extreme weather event is an event that is rare at a particular
place and time of year. Definitions of ‘rare’ vary, but an extreme
weather event would normally be as rare as or rarer than the 10th
or 90th percentile of a probability density function estimated from
observations. By definition, the characteristics of what is called
extreme weather may vary from place to place in an absolute
sense. When a pattern of extreme weather persists for some time,
such as a season, it may be classified as an extreme climate event,
especially if it yields an average or total that is itself extreme
(e.g., high temperature, drought, or total rainfall over a season).

climate event).

A broad set of methods and technologies that aim to deliber-
ately alter the climate system in order to alleviate the impacts of
climate change. Most, but not all, methods seek to either (1) reduce
the amount of absorbed solar energy in the climate system (solar
radiation management, or solar radiation modification, SRM) or
(2) increase net carbon sinks from the atmosphere at a scale suf-
ficiently large to alter climate (ie. carbon dioxide removal, CDR).
Scale and intent are of central importance. Two key characteristics
of geoengineering methods of particular concern are that they use or
affect the climate system (e.g., atmosphere, /and or ocean) globally
or regionally and/or could have substantive unintended effects that
cross national boundaries. Geoengineering is different from weather
modification and ecological engineering, but the boundary can be
unclear (IPCC, 2012b, p. 2). See also Blue carbon.

economy and society are governed or regulated; and how collec-

(eg., a government restricting resource use), non-governmen-

(e.g., resource users establishing rules or norms for restricting use of
a common resource) or any combination of these. Governance does
not only include establishing institutions such as laws or policies, but
also their implementation, enforcement and monitoring. The term
‘governance’ is used in diverse and contested ways.

The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is an international treaty adopted in
December 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, at the Third Session of the Confer-
ence of the Parties (COP3) to the UNFCCC. It contains legally binding
commitments, in addition to those included in the UNFCCC. Coun-
tries included in Annex B of the Protocol (mostly OECD countries and
countries with economies in transition) agreed to reduce their anthro-
pogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (carbon dioxide (CO,),
methane (CH,), nitrous oxide (N20), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), per-
fluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6)) by at least 5%
below 1990 levels in the first commitment period (2008-2012). The
Kyoto Protocol entered into force on 16 February 2005 and as of May
2018 had 192 Parties (191 States and the European Union). A second
commitment period was agreed in December 2012 at COP18, known
as the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol, in which a new set of
Parties committed to reduce GHG emissions by at least 18% below
1990 levels in the period from 2013 to 2020. However, as of May
2018, the Doha Amendment had not received sufficient ratifications
to enter into force. See also Anthropogenic and Paris Agreement.

Elements of a classification framework, first developed in the IPCC
Third Assessment Report, which aims to facilitate judgments about
what level of climate change may be dangerous (in the language of

considering hazards, exposures, vulnerabilities, capacities to adapt,
and the resulting impacts.

The change in the net, downward minus upward, radiative flux
(expressed in W m~) at the tropopause or top of atmosphere due to
a change in an external driver of climate change, such as a change
in the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO,), the concentration of
volcanic aerosols or in the output of the Sun. The traditional radia-
tive forcing is computed with all tropospheric properties held fixed at
their unperturbed values, and after allowing for stratospheric temper-
atures, if perturbed, to readjust to radiative-dynamical equilibrium.
Radiative forcing is called instantaneous if no change in stratospheric
temperature is accounted for. The radiative forcing once rapid adjust-
ments are accounted for is termed the effective radiative forcing.
Radiative forcing is not to be confused with cloud radiative forc-
ing, which describes an unrelated measure of the impact of clouds
on the radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere.

Change to the height of sea level, both globally and locally (re/ative
sea level change) at seasonal, annual, or longer time scales due to
(1) a change in ocean volume as a result of a change in the mass
of water in the ocean (e.g., due to melt of glaciers and ice sheets),
(2) changes in ocean volume as a result of changes in ocean water
density (e.g., expansion under warmer conditions), (3) changes in the
shape of the ocean basins and changes in the Earth’s gravitational
and rotational fields, and (4) local subsidence or uplift of the /and.
