of methodologies has been initiated and more will be given high priority in the next few years.

"It is well known that there are a number of uncertainties in the IPCC estimates of climate warming. The Panel has
neither hidden nor ignored them. It has made every effort ~ and will continue to do so — to assess both their qualitative and

"emissions resulting from human activities are

concentrations of the greenhouse gases: carbon
dioxide, methane, chlorofluorocarbons, and nitrous
oxide;

the evidence from the modelling studies, from
observations and the sensitivity analyses indicate
that the sensitivity of global mean surface
temperature to doubling CO, is unlikely to lie
outside the range 1.5° to 4.5°C;

there are many uncertainties in our predictions
particularly with regard to the timing, magnitude
and regional patterns of climate change due to our
incomplete understanding;

global mean surface air temperature has increased
by 0.3° to 0.6°C over the last 100 years;

the size of this warming is broadly consistent with
predictions of climate models, but it is also of the
same magnitude as natural climate variability. Thus
the observed increase could be largely due to this
natural variability; alternatively this variability and
other human factors could have offset a still larger
human-induced greenhouse warming;

respect of both their physical realism and their
ability to simulate present climate on large scales,

Transient (time-dependent) simulations with
coupled ocean-atmosphere models (CGCMs), in
which neither aerosols nor ozone changes have
been included, suggest a rate of global warming that
is consistent, within the range of uncertainties, with
the 0.3°C per decade warming rate quoted by [PCC
(1990) for Scenario A of greenhouse gas emissions.

"The large-scale geographical patterns of warming
produced by the transient model runs with CGCMs
are generally similar to the patterns produced by the
earlier equilibrium models except that the transient
simulations show reduced warming over the
northern North Atlantic and the southern oceans
near Antarctica.

CGCMs are capable of reproducing some features
of atmospheric variability on intra-decadal time-
scales.

Our understanding of some climate feedbacks and
their incorporation in the models has improved. In
particular, there has been some clarification of the
role of upper tropospheric water vapour. The role of
other processes, in particular cloud effects, remains
unresolved.

"The cooling effect of aerosols* resulting from
sulphur emissions may have offset a significant part
of the greenhouse warming in the Northern
Hemisphere (NH) during the past several decades.
Although this phenomenon was recognized in the
1990 report, some progress has been made in
quantifying its effect.

The Global Warming Potential (GWP) remains a
useful concept but its practical utility for many
gases depends on adequate quantification of the
indirect effects as well as the direct. We now
recognize that there is increased uncertainty in the
calculation of GWPs, particularly in the indirect
components and, whilst indirect GWPs are likely to
be significant for some gases, the numerical
estimates in this Supplementary Report are limited
to direct GWPs.

Whilst the rates of increase in the atmospheric
concentrations of many greenhouse gases have
continued to grow or remain steady. those of
methane and some halogen compounds have
slowed.

Some data indicate that global emissions of
methane from rice paddies may amount to less than
previously estimated.

"The anomalously high global mean surface
temperatures of the late 1980s have continued into
1990 and 1991 which are the warmest years in the
record.

Average warming over parts of the Northern
Hemisphere mid-latitude continents has been found
to be largely characterized by increases in minimum
(night-time) rather than maximum (daytime)
temperatures.

Radiosonde data indicate that the lower troposphere
has warmed over recent decades. Since meaningful
trends cannot be assessed over periods as short as a
decade, the widely reported disagreements between
decadal trends of air temperature from satellite and
surface data cannot be confirmed because the trends
are statistically indistinguishable.

The volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 is
expected to lead to transitory stratospheric
warming. With less certainty, because of other
natural influences, surface and tropospheric cooling
may occur during the next few years.

Average warming over the Northern Hemisphere
during the last four decades has not been uniform,
with marked seasonal and geographic variations;
this warming has been especially slow, or absent,
over the extratropical north west Atlantic.

germane to water vapour which is not uniformly mixed

rates of most of these gases have been steady or increasing
over the past decade, that of CH, and some of the halocar-
bons has been decreasing. The rate for CH, has declined
from about 20 ppbv/yr in the late 1970s to possibly as low
as 10 ppbv/yr in 1989. While a number of hypotheses have

"A necessary starting point for the prediction of changes
in climate due to increases in greenhouse gases and
aerosols is an estimate of their future concentrations.
This requires a knowledge of both the strengths of their
sources (natural and man-made) and also the mecha-
nisms of their eventual removal from the atmosphere
(their sinks). The projections of future concentrations
can then be used in climate models to estimate the cli-
matic response. We also need to determine whether or not
the predicted changes will be noticeable above the natu-
ral variations in climate. Finally, observations are
essential in order to monitor climate, to study climatic
processes and to help in the development and validation
of models.

"Atmospheric concentrations and trends of other gases
that influence the radiative budget: Ozone (O,) is an
effective greenhouse gas both in the stratosphere and in the
troposphere. Significant decreases have been observed dur-
ing the last one to two decades in total column O, at all
latitudes - except the tropics - in spring, summer and win-
ter. The downward trends were larger during the 1980s than
in the 1970s. These decreases have occurred predominant-
ly in the lower stratosphere (below 25km), where the rate of
decrease has been up to 10% per decade depending on alti-
tude. In addition, there is evidence to indicate that O, levels
in the troposphere up to 10km altitude above the few exist-
ing ozonesonde stations at northern middle latitudes have
increased by about 10% per decade over the past two
decades. Also, the abundance of carbon monoxide (CO)
appears to be increasing in the NH at about 1% per year.
However, there is little new information on the global trends
of other tropospheric O, precursors, (non-methane hydro-

These and other factors are needed to estimate annual net
emissions but significant uncertainties exist in our quanti-
tative knowledge of them. Since IPCC (1990) some progress
has been made in reducing the uncertainties associated with
the rate of deforestation, at least in Brazil. A comprehensive,
multi-year, high spatial resolution satellite data set has been
used to estimate that the average rate of deforestation in the
Brazilian Amazonian forest between 1978 and 1989 was 2.1
million hectares (Mha) per year. The rate increased between
1978 and the mid-1980s, and has decreased to 1.4 Mha/yr
in 1990. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),
using information supplied by individual countries, recent-
ly estimated that the rate of global tropical deforestation in
closed and open canopy forests for the period 1981-1990
was about 17 Mha/yr, approximately 50% higher than in the

are still many uncertainties in accurately quantifying the
magnitude of emissions from individual sources. Significant
new information includes a revised rate of removal of CH,
by atmospheric hydroxy] (OH) radicals (because of a lower
rate constant), a new evaluation of some of the sources
(e.g., from rice fields) and the addition of new sources (e.g.,
animal and domestic waste). Recent CH, isotopic studies
suggest that approximately 100Tg CH, (20% of the total
CH, source) is of fossil origin, largely from the coal, oil, and
natural gas industries. Recent studies of CH, emissions
from rice agriculture, in particular Japan, India, Australia,
Thailand and China, show that the emissions depend on
growing conditions, particularly soil characteristics, and
vary significantly. While the overall uncertainty in the mag-
nitude of global emissions from rice agriculture remains
large, a detailed analysis now suggests significantly lower
annual emissions than reported in IPCC 1990. The latest
estimate of the atmospheric lifetime of CH, is about 1]

"Since IPCC (1990) particular attention has focussed on
understanding the processes controlling the release and
uptake of CO, from both the terrestrial biosphere and the
oceans, and on the quantification of the fluxes. Based on
models and the atmospheric distribution of CO,, it appears
that there is a small net addition of carbon to the atmo-
sphere from the equatorial region, a combination of
outgassing of CO, from warm tropical waters and a terres-
trial biospheric component that is the residual between large
sources (including deforestation) and sinks. There appears
to be a strong Northern Hemisphere sink. containing both
oceanic and terrestrial biospheric components, and a weak
Southern Hemisphere (SH) sink. The previous IPCC glob-
al estimate for an ocean sink of 2.0+0.8 GtC per year is still
a reasonable one. The terrestrial biospheric processes which
are suggested as contributing to the sinks are sequestration
due to forest regeneration, and fertilization arising from the
effects of both CO, and nitrogen (N), but none of these can
be adequately quantified. This implies that the imbalance (of
order 1-2 GtC/yr) between sources and sinks, i.e., “the miss-
ing sink”, has not yet been resolved. This fact has significant
consequences for estimates of future atmospheric CO, con-
centrations and the analysis of the concept of the
Greenhouse Warming Potential.

"These factors have led to an update of the SA90. Six alter-
native IPCC Scenarios (IS92 a-f) now embody a wide array
of assumptions, summarized in Table |, affecting how future
greenhouse gas emissions might evolve in the absence of cli-
mate policies beyond those already adopted. This constitutes
a significant improvement over the previous methodology.
However, the probability of any of the resulting emission
paths has not been analyzed. IPCC WGI does not prefer any
individual scenario. Other combinations of assumptions
could illustrate a broader variety of emission trajectories.
The different worlds which the new scenarios imply, in
terms of economic, social and environmental conditions,
vary widely. The current exercise provides an interim view
and lays a basis for a more complete study of future emis-

high fossil fuel availability and eventual hypothetical phase-

"Indirect Global Warming Potentials: Because of our
incomplete understanding of chemical processes, most of

revised numerical values, we know, however, that the indi-
rect GWP for methane is positive and could be comparable
in magnitude to its direct value. In contrast, based on the
sub-section above, the indirect GWPs for chlorine and
bromine halocarbons are likely to be negative. The concept
of a GWP for short-lived. in homogeneously distributed
constituents, such as CO, NMHC, and NO, may prove inap-
plicable, although, as noted above, we know that these
constituents will affect the radiative balance of the atmo-

Similarly, a GWP for SO, is viewed to be inapplicable
because of the non-uniform distribution of sulphate aerosols.

"Global Warming Potentials: Gases can exert a radiative
forcing both directly and indirectly: direct forcing occurs
when the gas itself is a greenhouse gas; indirect forcing
occurs when chemical transformation of the original gas
produces a gas or gases which themselves are greenhouse
gases. The concept of the Giobal Warming Potential (GWP)
has been developed for policymakers as a measure of the
possible warming effect on the surface-troposphere system
arising from the emission of each gas relative to CO,. The
indices are calculated for the contemporary atmosphere and
do not take into account possible changes in chemical com-
position of the atmosphere. Changes in radiative forcing due
to CO,, on a kg basis, are non-linear with changes in the
atmospheric CO, concentrations. Hence, as CO, levels
increase from present values, the GWPs of the non-CO,
gases would be higher than those evaluated here. For the
concept to be most useful, both the direct and indirect com-
ponents of the GWP need to be quantified.

"At the time of IPCC (1990), it was recognized that sul-
phate aerosols exert a significant negative radiative
forcing on climate but this forcing was not well quanti-
fied. Since then progress has been made in understanding
radiative forcing by sulphate aerosols, and an additional
source of negative forcing has been identified in the
depletion of stratospheric ozone due to halocarbons. The
lack of these negative forcing factors in GCMs does not
negate the results obtained from them so far. For exam-
ple the estimates of climate sensitivity, which is defined
purely in terms of CO, concentrations, are unchanged,
and it is still believed that anthropogenic greenhouse
gases, now and even more so in the future. represent the
largest perturbation to the natural radiative balance of the
atmosphere. However it does mean that the rates of
change of, say, surface temperature do need to be adjust-
ed for additional forcing factors before they can fulfil
condition (a). The second condition is fulfitled when we
use a specific prediction (as opposed to a scenario) of
future atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.

the net rate of increase in surface temperature is expected to

atmosphere-ocean global climate models (CGCMs) which
incorporate a detailed description of the deep ocean and
therefore can simulate the climate lag induced by the deep

a realistic simulation of present climate and this may distort
the models’ response to small perturbations such as those

"Analyses subsequent to those included in the IPCC First
Assessment Report (1990) reinforce the major conclusion of
that report that natural terrestrial ecosystems could face sig-
nificant environmental impacts as a result of the global
increases in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse
gases and associated climatic changes. In particular, these
studies continue to suggest that the rate of these changes will
be the major factor in determining the type and degree of
impacts with a variety of responses expected for different
regions and for different communities within ecosystems.
Current climatic projections continue to suggest that the
rates of change are likely to be faster than the ability of some
component species to respond and that species and ecosys-
tem responses may be sudden, potentially leading to
ecosystem destabilization or degradation.

"~ The impact of sea level rise depends on the total net rise
resulting from the relative vertical movements of the land
and of the sea. In areas undergoing natural eustatic uplift-
ing of the land due to tectonic plate movement, glacial
rebound, and vulcanism, there will be little relative rise of
sea level. In land areas that are naturally falling as in the
southeastern USA, due to tectonic and compaction forces,
impacts of sea level rise will be more important. A new
study of the Bering Sea indicates that in areas without nat-
ural land uplift, there could be important impacts where
there is a high density of marine organisms dependent on
certain types of on-shore and near-shore marine environ-
ments that may be affected by sea level change.
Nevertheless, sea level rise is of far less consequence in
northern areas than are other impacts of climate change to
northem ecosystems and to global carbon cycling. These
regions are very important in the global carbon cycle and a
small temperature rise may cause significant increases in
bioproductivity and in carbon flux to the oceans.

"Reducing global anthropogenic methane emissions by about
15-20 percent can halt rising atmospheric concentration of
methane. A technological assessment of options for reduc-
ing methane emissions from anthropogenic sources (about
60 percent of global methane emissions) has been developed
through the United States/Japan Working Group on
Methane, which compiled information submitted by IPCC
participating countries. Technological options are available
for limiting emissions from the major sources, other than
flooded rice cultivation and biomass burning. These options
may be economically viable at suitable locations in many
regions of the world, and represent different levels of tech-
nical and capital needs (summarized in Table 2). In many
cases, these options provide a range of benefits, including
better air quality. better protection of surface and ground-
water, enhanced productivity, reduced risk of explosion,
and improved availability and use of energy resources.
Some of these technologies are already established and
proven beneficial in certain markets. Barriers which hinder
the further implementation of these options in many coun-
tries, especially developing countries include availability of
capital. lack of technical information. and conflicting incen-
tive systems. These barriers need to be addressed on a

that the costs of applying carbon tax measures could reduce

of electricity use and associated growth in projected carbon

"One option for reducing CO2 emissions is the substitution
of natural gas for more carbon-intensive fuels. The demand
for gas is growing worldwide and is expected to nearly
double by the year 2005. As the starting point for its anal-
ysis, the IPCC has reviewed the International Energy
Agency's (IEA) natural gas study. Natural Gas Prospects
and Policies (October 1991). This study provides a com-
prehensive analysis of demand and supply for natural gas
including the institutional framework surrounding the pro-
duction, transmission and use of natural gas. The study’s
primary focus 1s on demand for natural gas in OECD coun-
tries. but sources from outside the OECD are extensively
treated. The IEA forecasts that demand for natural gas out-
side OECD will be approximately twice that of OECD by
2005. The study indicates that ample gas resources exist
worldwide even with the expected doubling of demand in
some of the regions through the year 2005 at prices ranging
from $3 to $6 per MBtu (in 1990 US$). However, the study
did not address the ability to meet demand after 2005.
Intergovernmental agreements to facilitate and maintain
competitive markets, access to resources and transmission
systems, and commercial contracts on a non-discriminato-

both nitrate leaching and denitrification, although the ratio
of N, to N,O formation varies considerably from case to

the unused but virtually the whole nitrogen introduced by
mankind into the world ecosystem will sooner or later
become denitrified, thus adding to the overall N,O increase
in the atmosphere. The significant unknown is the time
scale over which this will occur.

"As for the release of methane, total global and individual
source emission estimates remain essentially as presented
in the IPCC First Assessment Report (1990), but with some
individual source changes. There has been a reevaluation
of some sources, particularly rice, and the additional sources
such as animal and domestic wastes. A large portion of
these emissions comes from liquid waste handling systems.
Uncertainties in global and regional emissions remain sig-
nificant. A detailed analysis of new information on rice
suggests annual emissions in the lower end of the 20-150

activities is concerned, forest clearing in the tropical and
subtropical areas of the world continue to be the major
source. Additionally, the cultivation of virgin land, whether
in tropical or temperate agricultural areas, results in grad-
ual carbon losses. Its relative contribution, however, to
CO, concentrations is still to be determined. At the other
extreme, long-standing arable soils do not constitute a major
net source of CO,, because their carbon contents reach
equilibria which do not change very much unless cropping

"Unfortunately, the data concerning the release of nitrous
oxide from agriculture still cannot be reliably derived.
Keeping in mind that the annual increase of N,O in the
atmosphere is 3 - 4.5 Tg of nitrogen as N,O, and knowing
that the release from combustion processes has thus far been
overestimated. most of this net increase may be due to anthro-
pogenic nitrogen inputs. About 80 Tg of industrially-fixed
nitrogen is presently applied to world agriculture. Taking
the upper value of estimates for the conversion of fertiliz-
er nitrogen into N,O, which is 3.2 %, the fertilizer-induced
release for 1990 could be calculated as 2.5 Tg of nitrogen
as N,O. Since another 90 Tg of nitrogen or so are fixed by
managed leguminous plants, this combination could account
for most of the increase of N,O in the atmosphere.

countries of the potential impacts on the coastal resources
due to ASLR and other impacts of climate change. This
awareness has manifested itself in their interest in integrat-

and assisted. Most coastal developing countries have not
developed CZM planning capabilities, or made assessments
of their vulnerability to ASLR. Even though, in many cases,
long lead times are required to begin the process of adapta-

taken any measures as might be necessary.

Insufficient information: Many developing coun-

issue of potential climate change to appreciate the
concern it evokes elsewhere in the world.
Information is often insufficient with respect to the
scientific basis for concern, on the potential phys-
ical and socio-economic impacts of climate change
as well as on response options. This applies not
only to scientific milieux but also to policymakers
and public opinion.

Insufficient communication: Even if the situation

is the problem of insufficient internal and external
communication mechanisms for the proper dis-
semination of the information on matters related to
climate change.

Limited human resources: Lack of adequate num-
ber of trained personnel in almost all areas ranging
from academic, scientific efforts to applications of
knowledge to food and energy production, to
water management, to human settlements prob-
lems, to trade and economic growth, and to a host
of other related endeavours is common to many
developing nations. Most of them. if not all, can
command only limited pool of experts and respon-
sible and knowledgeable officials, and even that
only in a few of these areas.

Institutional difficulties: The multi-disciplinary
and cross-cutting nature of the issues involved
demands relatively high degree of co-ordination
among the various departments/ ministries of gov-
ermments.

Limited financial resources: Survival needs come
first. After that, the limited financial, and conse-
quent general lack of technological, resources
dictate the priorities. Means of meeting the incre-
mental costs of ensuring a viable environment
frequently cannot be found. Also, local immedi-
ate, environmental concerns generally receive
political priority over impersonal, global concems.

"In many developing countries the meteorological/ hydro-
logical service 1s the main and often the only institution
collecting and recording data with relevance to climate. If
associated weather patterns are modified, as some predict
they would as a result of climate change. then the capabil-
ities of such services need to be reinforced to enhance their
contributions to sustainable development.

meetings, references were made to issues and recent work
not fully taken into account or peer-reviewed during the
preparation of the Working Groups’ supplementary reports.
All available studies should be thoroughly peer-reviewed as
part of the IPCC follow-up process.

"The establishment of mechanisms for national co-ordination
of all (national) actrvities related to climate change could be
considered by the developing countries. The mechanisms
could aid such areas as information dissemination, devel-
opment and implementation of plans for research and
Monitoring. and formulation of policy options. The indus-
trialized countries could consider assisting the developing
countries in setting up the mechanisms.

"The current unevenness in the acquisition and use of such
data which is evident between the hemispheres should be
eliminated. The Special Committee further recommended
that the developing countries take immediate action to iden-

be necessary to mobilize appropriate funding in order to
mount a sustained programme and create regional centres to
organize information networks on climate change.

"1.0.1

We are certain of the following:

There is a natural greenhouse effect which already
keeps the Earth warmer than it would otherwise be.

Emissions resulting from human activities are substan-
tially increasing the atmospheric concentrations of the
greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, chloro-
fluorocarbons (CFCs) and nitrous oxide. These increases
will enhance the greenhouse effect, resulting on average
in an additional warming of the Earth’s surface. The
main greenhouse gas, water vapour, will increase in
response to global warming and further enhance it.
"	List
"1.0.2

We calculate with confidence that:

Some gases are potentially more effective than others
at changing climate, and their relative effectiveness can
be estimated. Carbon dioxide has been responsible for
over half of the enhanced greenhouse effect in the
past, and is likely to remain so in the future.

Atmospheric concentrations of the long-lived gases
(carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and the CFCs) adjust
only slowly to changes of emissions. Continued
emissions of these gases at present rates would commit
us to increased concentrations for centuries ahead.
The longer emissions continue to increase at present-
day rates, the greater reductions would have to be for
concentrations to stabilize at a given level.

For the four scenarios of future emissions which IPCC
has developed as assumptions (ranging from one
where few or no steps are taken to limit emissions, viz.,
Scenario A or Business-as-Usual Scenario, through
others with increasing levels of controls respectively
called Scenarios B, C and D). there will be a doubling
of equivalent carbon dioxide concentrations from pre-
industrial levels by about 2025, 2040 and 2050 in
Scenarios A, B, and C respectively (see the section
“Which gases are the most important?” in the
Policymaker Summary of Working Group I for a
description of the concept of equivalent carbon
dioxide). See the Appendix for a description of the
IPCC emissions scenarios.

Stabilization of equivalent carbon dioxide
concentrations at about twice the pre-industrial level

"An average rate of increase of global mean
temperature during the next century of about 0.3°C per
decade (with an uncertainty range of 0.2—0.5°C per
decade) assuming the IPCC Scenario A (Business-as-
Usual) emissions of greenhouse gases; this is a more
rapid increase than seen over the past 10,000 years.
This will result in a likely increase in the global mean
temperature of about 1°C above the present value by
2025 (about 2°C above that in the pre-industrial
period), and 3°C above today’s value before the end of
the next century (about 4°C above pre-industrial). The
rise will not be steady because of other factors.

Under the other IPCC emissions scenarios which
assume progressively increasing levels of controls,
rates of increase in global mean temperature of about
0.2°C per decade (Scenario B), just above 0.1°C per
decade (Scenario C) and about 0.1°C per decade
(Scenario D). The rise will not be steady because of
other factors.

Land surfaces warm more rapidly than the oceans,
and higher northern latitudes warm more than the
global mean in winter.

The oceans act as a heat sink and thus delay the full
effect of a greenhouse warming. Therefore, we would
be committed to a further temperature rise which
would progressively become apparent in the ensuing
decades and centuries. Models predict that as
greenhouse gases increase, the realized temperature
rise at any given time is between 50 and 80% of the
committed temperature rise.

Uur judgement ts tat:

Global mean surface air temperature has increased by
0.3 to 0.6°C over the last 100 years, with the five
global-average warmest years being in the 1980’s.
Over the same period global sea-level increased by 10
to 20 cm. These increases have not been smooth in
time, nor uniform over the globe.

The size of the warming over the last century is
broadly consistent with the prediction by climate
models, but is also of the same magnitude as natural
climate variability. If the sole cause of the observed
warming were the human-made greenhouse effect,
then the implied climate sensitivity would be near the
lower end of the range inferred from models. Thus the
observed increase could be largely due to this natural
variability: alternatively this variability and other
human factors could have offset a still larger human-
induced greenhouse warming. The unequivocal
detection of the enhanced greenhouse effect from
observations is not likely for a decade or more.

Measurements from ice cores going back 160,000 years
show that the Earth’s temperature closely paralleled the
amount of carbon dioxide and methane in the
atmosphere. Although we do not know the details of
cause and effect, calculations indicate that changes in
these greenhouse gases were part, but not all, of the
reasons for the large (5—-7°C) global temperature
swings between ice ages and interglacial periods.

preparedness policies, coastal zone management and
control measures for desertification, many of these
being justified in their own right. Measures to limit or
adapt to climate change should be as cost-effective as

+ Assessing areas at risk from sea-level rise and
developing comprehensive management plans to
reduce future vulnerability of populations and coastal

regulations and/or through market-based economic
instruments. The latter. through their encouragement
of flexible selection of abatement measures, tend to
encourage innovation and the development of
improved technologies and practices for reducing
emissions and therefore frequently offer the possibility
of achieving environmental improvements at lower
costs than through regulatory mechanisms. It is not

. There is no single quick-fix technological option for
limiting greenhouse gas emissions. Phased and

development and deployment, including
improvement and reassessment of existing
technologies, Such strategies should involve
opportunities for international co-operation. A
comprehensive strategy addressing all aspects of the
problem and reflecting environmental, economic and
social costs and benefits is necessary.

. Because a large, projected increase in world population
will be a major factor in causing the projected increase
in global greenhouse gases, it 1s essential that global
climate change strategies take tnto account the need to
deal with the issue of the rate of growth of the world
population.

. Subject to their particular circumstances, individual
nations, or groups of nations, may wish to consider
taking steps now to attempt to limit, stabilize or reduce
the emission of greenhouse gases resulting from
human activities and prevent the destruction and
improve the effectiveness of sinks. One option that
governments may wish to consider is the setting of
targets for CO, and other greenhouse gases.

future emissions:
"	Text
"Scenario C (Control Policies Scenario) assumes that a shift
towards renewable energies and safe nuclear energy takes
place in the latter part of the next century, CFC gases are
phased out and agricultural emissions (methane and nitrous
oxide) are limited; an equivalent doubling of pre-industrial
carbon dioxide will occur in about 2050.

"Scenario B (Low Emissions Scenario) assumes that the
energy supply mix of fossil fuels shifts towards natural gas,
large efficiency increases are achieved, deforestation is
reversed and emissions of CFCs are reduced by 50% from
their 1986 levels. This results in an equivalent doubling of
pre-industrial carbon dioxide by about 2040.
"	Text
"Scenario D (Accelerated Policies Scenario) assumes that a
rapid shift to renewable energies and safe nuclear energy
takes place early in the next century, stringent emission
controls in industrial countries and moderate growth of
emissions in developing countries. This scenario, which
assumes carbon dioxide emissions are reduced to 50% of
1985 levels, stabilizes equivalent carbon dioxide
concentrations at about twice the pre-industrial levels towards
the end of the next century.

"Scenario A (Business-as-Usual) assumes that few or no
steps are taken to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Energy
use and clearing of tropical forests continue and fossil fuels,
in particular coal, remain the world’s primary energy source.
The Montreal Protocol comes into effect but without
strengthening and with less than 100 percent compliance.
Under this scenario, the equivalent of a doubling of pre-
industrial CO, levels occurs. according to Working Group
I, by around 2025.

"Both scenario approaches indicate that CO, emissions will
grow from about 7 BtC (billion or 1000 million tonnes
carbon) per year now to 12-15 BrC per year by the year
2025. Scenario A (Business-as-Usual) includes a partial
phase-out of CFCs under the Montreal Protocol and lower
CO, and CH, emissions than the Reference Scenario. The
Reference Scenario developed through country and
international studies of the energy and agriculture groups,
includes higher CO, emissions and assumed a total CFC
phase-out. The results indicate that the CO, equivalent
concentrations and their effects on global climate are similar.
"	Text
"2 All of the scenarios assumed some level of compliance with the Montreal Protocol but not with all of the (June 1990) amendments
agreed to in London. The London amendments to the Montreal Protocol, when fully implemented, would result in a virtually
complete elimination of production of fully halogenated CFCs, halons, carbon tetrachloride and methyl! chloroform early i the 2Ist
century. The Parties of the Protocol also call for later elimination of HCFCs. Thus, the assumptions of Scenarios A and B
overestimate the radiative forcing potential of CFCs and halons. Additionally, the UN has provided recent population projections that
estimate higher population than used in the global model scenarios (Scenarios A through D); use of these newer projections would
increase future CO emissions. Additionally, the Reference Scenario CO. emissions are higher than Scenario A (Business-as-Usual),
suggesting Scenario A (Business-as-Usual) may be an underestimate.

"One method used global models to develop four
scenarios which were subsequently used by Working
Group I to develop scenarios of future warming. All

anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide and
methane from these scenarios are shown in Figures |

The second method used studies of the energy and

considering possible future patterns of emissions and the
broad responses that might affect those patterns. No full

limitations in our ability to estimate future rates of”
population and economic growth, individual behaviour,
technological innovation, and other factors which are crucial
for determining emission rates over the course of the next
century, there is some uncertainty in the projections of
greenhouse gas emissions. Reflecting these inherent

the best estimates at this time covering emissions over the
next century, but continued work to develop improved

Executive Summary

1. We are certain of the following:

. there is a natural greenhouse effect which already
keeps the Earth warmer than it would otherwise be;

. emissions resulting from human activities are
substantially increasing the atmospheric concentrations
of the greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane,
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and nitrous oxide. These
increases will enhance the greenhouse effect, resulting
on average in an additional warming of the Earth’s
surface. The main greenhouse gas, water vapour, will
increase in response to global warming and further
enhance it.

nN

We calculate with confidence that:

. some gases are potentially more effective than others
at changing climate, and their relative effectiveness can
be estimated. Carbon dioxide has been responsible for
over half the enhanced greenhouse effect in the past,
and is tikely to remain so in the future;

. atmospheric concentrations of the long-lived gases
(carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and the CFCs) adjust
only slowly to changes in emissions. Continued
emissions of these gases at present rates would commit
us to creased concentrations for centuries ahead. The
longer emissions continue to increase at present day
tates, the greater reductions would have to be for
concentrations to stabilize at a given level:

. the long-lived gases would require immediate
reductions in emissions from human activities of over
60% to stabilize their concentrations at today’s levels;
methane would require a 15-20% reduction.

3. Based on current model results, we
predict:

. under the IPCC Business-as-Usual (Scenario A)
emissions of greenhouse gases, a rate of increase of
global-mean temperature during the next century of
about 0.3°C per decade (with an uncertainty range of
0.2°C to 0.5°C per decade); this is greater than that
seen over the past 10,000 years. This will result in a
likely increase in global-mean temperature of about
1°C above the present value by 2025 and 3°C before
the end of the next century. The rise will not be steady
because of the influence of other factors;

, under the other IPCC emission scenarios which assume
progressively increasing levels of controls, rates of

To improve our predictive capability, we
need:

to understand better the various climate-related
processes, particularly those associated with clouds,
oceans and the carbon cycle;

to improve the systematic observation of climate-
related variables on a global basis, and further
investigate changes which took place in the past;

to develop improved models of the Earth’s climate
system;

"the same period global sea level has increased by !0-
20 cm. These increases have not been smooth with
time, nor uniform over the globe.

The size of this warming is broadly consistent with
predictions of climate models, but it is also of the same
magnitude as natural climate variability. Thus the
observed increase could be largely due to this natural
variability; alternatively this variability and other
human factors could have offset a still larger human-
induced greenhouse warming. The unequivocal
detection of the enhanced greenhouse effect from
observations is not likely for a decade or more.

There is no firm evidence that climate has become
more variable over the last few decades. However,
with an increase in the mean temperature, episodes of
high temperatures wil! most likely become more
frequent in the future, and cold episodes less frequent.

Ecosystems affect climate, and will be affected by a
changing climate and by increasing carbon dioxide
concentrations. Rapid changes in climate will change
the composition of ecosystems; some species will
benefit while others will be unable to migrate or adapt
fast enough and may become extinct. Enhanced levels
of carbon dioxide may increase productivity and
efficiency of water use of vegetation. The effect of
warming on biological processes, although poorly
understood, may increase the atmospheric
concentrations of natural greenhouse gases.

1990. Although continuing research will deepen this under-
standing and require the report to be updated at frequent
intervals, basic conclusions concerning the reality of the

climate are unlikely to change significantly. Nevertheless,
the complexity of the system may give rise to surprises.

"1.0.1 There is concern that human activities may be
inadvertently changing the climate of the globe through the
enhanced greenhouse effect, by past and continuing
emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases which will
cause the temperature of the Earth’s surface to increase—
popularly termed the “global warming”. If this occurs,
consequent changes may have a significant impact on
society.

"2.1.3 One of the most important factors is the
greenhouse effect; a simplified explanation of which is as
follows. Short-wave solar radiation can pass through the
clear atmosphere relatively unimpeded. But long-wave
terrestrial radiation emitted by the warm surface of the Earth
is partially absorbed and then re-emitted by a number of
trace gases in the cooler atmosphere above. Since. on
average, the outgoing long-wave radiation balances the
incoming solar radiation, both the atmosphere and the

"2.1.2. There are several natural factors which can change
the balance between the energy absorbed by the Earth and
that emitted by it in the form of longwave infra-red radiation;
these factors cause the radiative forcing on climate. The
most obvious of these is a change in the output of energy
from the Sun. There is direct evidence of such variability
over the 11-year solar cycle, and longer period changes
may also occur. Slow variations in the Earth’s orbit affect
the seasonal and latitudinal distribution of solar radiation;
these were probably responsible for initiating the ice ages.
"	Text
"2.1 What natural factors are important?

2.1.1 The driving energy for weather and climate comes
from the sun. The Earth intercepts solar radiation (including
that in the short-wave, visible, part of the spectrum); about
a third of it is reflected, the rest is absorbed by the different
components (atmosphere, ocean, ice, land and biota) of the
climate system. The energy absorbed from solar radiation is
balanced (in the long term) by outgoing radiation from the
Earth and atmosphere; this terrestrial radiation takes the
form of long-wave invisible infra-red energy, and its
magnitude is determined by the temperature of the Earth-
atmosphere system.

is already warmer by about 33°C (assuming the same
reflectivity of the earth) than it would be if the natural
greenhouse gases were not present. Satellite observations of
the radiation emitted from th eEarth’s surface and through the
atmosphere demonstrate the effect of the greenhouse gases.

"2.1.5 Aerosols (small particles) in the atmosphere can
also affect climate because they can reflect and absorb
radiation. The most important natural perturbations result
from explosive volcanic eruptions which affect
concentrations in the lower stratosphere. Lastly, the climate
has its own natural variability on all timescales and changes
occur without any externa! influence.

"2.2.4 Thirdly, measurements from ice cores going back
160,000 years show that the Earth’s temperature closely
paralleled the amount of carbon dioxide and methane in the

and effect, calculations indicate that changes in these
greenhouse gases were part, but not all, of the reason for the
large (5-7°C) global temperature swings between ice ages
and interglacial periods.

"2.3.1 Naturally occurring greenhouse gases keep the
Earth warm enough to be habitable. By increasing their
concentrations, and by adding new greenhouse gases like
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), humankind is capable of
raising the global-average annual-mean surface-air
temperature (which. for simplicity, is referred to as the
“global temperature”), although we are uncertain about the
rate at which this will occur. Strictly, this is an enhanced
greenhouse effect—above that occurring due to natural
greenhouse gas concentrations; the word “enhanced” is
usually omitted, but it should not be forgotten. Other
changes in climate are expected to result, for example
changes in precipitation, and a global warming will cause
sea levels to rise: these are discussed in more detail later.

"3.0.5 The sources of methane and nitrous oxide are less
well known. Methane concentrations have more than
doubled because of rice production, cattle rearing, biomass
burning, coal mining and ventilation of natural gas; also,
fossil fuel combustion may have also contributed through
chemical reactions in the atmosphere which reduce the rate
of removal of methane. Nitrous oxide has increased by
about 8% since pre-industrial times, presumably due to
human activities; we are unable to specify the sources, but

within the climate system, and, on a global scale, is not
affected by human sources and sinks. Water vapour will
increase in response to global warming and further enhance
it: this process is included in climate models. The
concentration of ozone is changing both in the stratosphere
and the troposphere due to human activities, but it is
difficult to quantify the changes from present observations.

"3.0.6 The effect of ozone on climate is strongest in the
upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Model
calculations indicate that ozone in the upper troposphere
should have increased due to human-made emissions of
nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. While
at ground level ozone has increased in the northern
hemisphere in response to these emissions, observations
are insufficient to confirm the expected increase in the upper
troposphere. The lack of adequate observations prevents us
from accurately quantifying the climatic effect of changes
in tropospheric ozone.

"3.0.4 Since the industrial revolution the combustion of
fossil fuels and deforestation have led to an increase of
26% in carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere.
We know the magnitude of the present day fossil-fuel
source, but the input from deforestation cannot be estimated
accurately. In addition, although about half of the emitted
carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere. we do not know
well how much of the remainder is absorbed by the oceans
and how much by terrestrial biota. Emissions of
chlorofluorocarbons, used as aerosol propellants, solvents,
refrigerants and foam blowing agents, are also well known;
they were not present in the atmosphere before their
invention in the 1930s.

concentrations, the atmosphere will try to respond (by warming) immediately. But the atmosphere is closely coupled
to the oceans, so in order for the air to be warmed by the greenhouse effect, the oceans also have to be warmed; because
of their thermal capacity this takes decades or centuries. This exchange of heat between atmosphere and ocean will
act to slow down the temperature rise forced by the greenhouse effect.

realized temperature rise at any time is about 50% of the committed temperature rise if the climate sensitivity (the
response to a doubling of carbon dioxide) is 4.5°C and about 80% if the climate sensitivity is 1.5°C. If the forcing
were then held constant, temperatures would continue to rise slowly, but it is not certain whether it would take decades

"In a hypothetical example where the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, following a period of
constancy, rises suddenly to a new level and remains there, the radiative forcing would also rise rapidly to a new level.
This increased radiative forcing would cause the atmosphere and oceans to warm, and eventually come to a new, stable,
temperature. A commitment to this equilibrium temperature rise is incurred as soon as the greenhouse gas concentration
changes. But at any time before equilibrium is reached, the actual temperature will have risen by only part of the

substantia! uncertainties, the prediction that an increase will
eventually occur is more certain. Furthermore, some model
calculations that have been extended beyond 100 years

affect climate. On a decadal timescale solar variability and
changes in greenhouse gas concentration could give changes
of similar magnitudes. However the variation in solar
intensity changes sign so that over longer timescales the
increases in greenhouse gases are likely to be more
important. Aerosols as a result of volcanic eruptions can
lead to a cooling at the surface which may oppose the

some indication of a general reduction in day-to-day

periods of comparatively rapid climate change at the end of

day-to-day pressure variations in the middle latitude depression belts and the maxima in interannual variability
responsible for the very different character of one winter from another both being represented. However, on regional

factors affecting the cloud amount and distribution and the
interaction of clouds with solar and terrestrial radiation),
which leads to a factor of two uncertainty in the size of the

the atmosphere and ocean, the atmosphere and land surfaces,

treatment of sea-ice and convection in the models is also
crude. Nevertheless. for reasons given in the box below, we

the broad-scale features of climate change.

"Atmospheric models have been coupled with simple models of the ocean to predict the equilibrium response to
greenhouse gases, under the assumption that the model errors are the same in a changed climate. The ability of such
models to simulate important aspects of the climate of the last ice age generates confidence in their usefulness.
Atmospheric models have also been coupled with multilayer ocean models (to give coupled ocean-atmosphere
GCMs) which predict the gradual response to increasing greenhouse gases. Although the models so far are of
relatively coarse resolution. the large scale structures of the ocean and the atmosphere can be simulated with some
skill. However, the coupling of ocean and atmosphere models reveals a strong sensitivity to small scale errors which
leads to a drift away from the observed climate. As yet, these errors must be removed by adjustments to the exchange
of heat between ocean and atmosphere. There are similarities between results from the coupled models using simple
representations of the ocean and those using more sophisticated descriptions, and our understanding of such differences
as do occur gives us some confidence in the results.

to natural variability: alternatively this variability and other
man-made factors could have offset a still larger man-made
greenhouse warming. The unequivocal detection of the

"whicn have used diflerent methodologies. Bdsed on the
existing literature. the studies have used several scenarios to
assess the potential impacts of climate change. These have
the features of:

(i) an effective doubling of CO, in the atmosphere
between now and 2025 to 2050 for a ‘business-as-
usual” scenario;

(ii) a consequent increase of global mean temperature in
the range of 1.5°C to 4.5°C;

(iii) an unequal global distribution of this temperature
imcrease, namely a smaller increase of half the global
mean in the tropical regions and a larger increase of
twice the global mean in the polar regions; and

(iv) asea-level rise of about 0.3—0.5 m by 2050 and about
1 m by 2100, together with a rise in the temperature of
the surface ocean layer of between 0.2° and 2.5°C.

3. These scenarios pre-date, but are in line with, the
recent assessment of Working Group I which, for a 'business-
as-usual’ scenario (scenario A in Working Group I Report)
has estimated the magnitude of sea-level rise at about 20 cm
by 2030 and about 65 cm by the end of the next century.
Working Group I has also predicted the increase in global
mean temperatures to be about 1°C above the present value
by 2025 and 3°C before the end of the next century.

4. Any predicted effects of climate change must be
viewed in the context of our present dynamic and changing
world. Large-scale natural events such as El Nifio can cause
significant impacts on agnculture and human settlement. The
predicted population explosion will produce severe impacts
on land use and on the demands for energy. fresh water, food
and housing. which will vary from region to region according
to national incomes and rates of development. In many
cases. the impacts will be felt most severely in regions

depend on the physiological adaptability of trees and the

the form of forest declines can occur. Losses from wildfire
will be increasingly extensive. The climate zones which
control species distribution will move poleward and to
higher elevations. Managed forests require large inputs in
terms of choice of seedlot and spacing, thinning and
protection. They provide a variety of products from fuel to
food. The degree of dependency on products varies among
countries, as does the ability to cope with and to withstand
loss. The most sensitive areas will be where species are
close to their biological limits in terms of temperature and
moisture. This ts fikely to be, for example, in semi-and

"Major finaings

Sufficient evidence is now available from a variety
of different studies to indicate that changes of
climate would have an important effect on
agriculture, including livestock. Yet the fact that
there are major uncertainties regarding likely effects
in specific regions should be a cause for concern.
Studies have not yet conclusively determined
whether, on average, global agricultural potential
will increase or decrease.

Negative impacts could be felt at the regional level as
a result of changes in weather, diseases, pests and
weeds associated with climate change, necessitating
innovation in technology and agriculture management
practices. There may be severe effects in some
regions, particularly in regions of high present-day
vulnerability that are least able to adjust
technologically to such effects.

There is a possibility that potential productivity of
high and mid-latitudes may increase because of a
prolonged growing season. but it is not likely to open
up large new areas for production, and will be largely
confined to the Northern Hemisphere.

On balance, the evidence is that in the face of
estimated changes of climate, food production at the
global level can be maintained at essentially the same
level as would have occurred without climate change;
but the cost of achieving this is unclear. Nonetheless.
climate changes may intensify difficulties in coping
with rapid population growth.

2.2.1

An improved ability is required to ‘scale-up’ our
understanding of effects on crops and livestock, effects
on farm production, on village production, and on
national and global food supply. This is particularly
important because policies must be designed to respond
to impacts at the national and global levels. Further
information is needed on the effects of changes in climate
on social and economic conditions in rural areas (e.g.
employment and income, equity considerations, farm
infrastructure, and support services).

Further information is needed on the range of potentially
effective technical adjustments at the farm and village
level (e.g. irrigation, crop selection, fertilizing, etc) and
on the economic and political constraints on such
adjustments. In particular, it is recommended that
national and international centres of agricultural research
consider the potential value of new research programs
aimed at identifying or developing cultivars and
management practices appropriate for altered climates.

Further information is needed on the range of potentially
effective policy responses at regional, national and
international levels (e.g. reallocation of land use, plant
breeding, improved agricultural extension schemes,
large-scale water transfers etc).

Major findings include:

For many watersheds worldwide, especially those in
arid and semi-arid regions, runoff is very sensitive to
small changes and variations in climate. For example,
a 1°C to 2°C temperature increase coupled with a 10%
reduction in precipitation could conceivably produce
a 40—70% reduction in annual runoff.

Based on empirical data and hydrological models,
annual runoff appears to be more sensitive to
changes in precipitation than to changes in
temperature. However, in regions where seasonal
snowfall and snowmelt are a major part of the total
water supply, the monthly distribution of runoff and
soil moisture is more sensitive to temperature than
to precipitation.

The construction of hypothetical scenarios provides
a range of runoff responses and the characteristics of
those responses for particular areas. However,
credible forecasts for any specific region, sufficient
to designate either direction or magnitude of change,
are not yet available. We can conduct warm
sensitivity analysis using General Circulation
Models while the scientific basis slowly improves.

Vulnerabilities in present water uses (ie where
demand exceeds firm yield) and conflicts among
current uses are likely to be exacerbated by global
warming in most arid and semi-arid regions.

The regions that appear to be at greatest risk, in terms
of serious threats to sustaining the population are:
Africa—Maghreb, Sahel, the north of Africa, southem
Africa; Asia—western Arabia, Southeast Asia, the
Indian subcontinent; North America—Mexico, Central
America, southwest US; South America—parts of
eastern Brazil; Europe—Mediterranean zone.

The relative degree of water management (storage
versus mean annual flow) is a primary determinant
in adapting to changes in the mean annual
variability.

It is essential that future design of water resource
engineering takes into account that climate is a non-
stationary process, and that structures with a design life
of 50 to more than 100 years should be designed to
accommodate climatic and hydrometeorological
conditions which may exist over the entire life of the

Assessment of the vulnerability of countries, especially

increase. Traditional cost-benefit analyses do not allow for
assessment of these risks. Although substantial scientific
uncertainty remains concerning the precise time, location

such as sea-level rise, are likely to proceed slowly but
steadily while others such as shifts in climate zones—which
will affect the occurrence of such events as floods, droughts

nations differ considerably in their vulnerability to such

considerable impact on humankind and individual

Industrialized countries and developing countries have
a common responsibility in dealing with problems
arising from climate change.

Industrialized countries have specific responsibilities
on two levels:

a) major part of emissions affecting the atmosphere at
present originates in industrialized countries where
the scope for change is greatest. Industrialized
countries should adopt domestic measures to limit
climate change by adapting their own economies in
line with future agreements to limit emissions;

b) to co-operate with developing countries in
international action, without standing in the way of the
latter’s development. by contributing additional
financial resources, by appropriate transfer of
technology, by engaging in close co-operation
concerning scientific observation, by analysis and
research, and finally by means of technical co-
operation geared to forestalling and managing
environmental problems.

Emissions from developing countries are growing and
may need to grow in order to meet their development
requirements and thus, over time, are likely to
represent an increasingly significant percentage of
global emissions. Developing countries have the
responsibility, within the limits feasible, to take
measures to suitably adapt their economies.

Sustainable development requires the proper concern
for environmental protection as the necessary basis
for continuing economic growth. Continuing
economic development will increasingly have to take
into account the issue of climate change. It is
imperative that the nght balance between economic
and environmental objectives be struck.

of measures to reduce global emissions are very difficult as
energy use, forestry, and land use patterns are primary
factors in the global economy. To take maximum advantage
of our increasing understanding of scientific and

"2.2.4 The Reference Scenario sets out an example of
the scope of the reductions in total global emissions which
might be necessary to stabilize or reduce CO, emissions.
The stabilization of global emissions at 1985 levels would
require reductions of 29% by 2000 and 59% by 2025. A
reduction of global emissions to 20% below 1985 levels
would require reductions of 44% in 2000 and 67% by 2025.

"2.2.5 The carbon intensity figures show, for each region,
the amount of carbon emitted per unit of energy consumed.
The contribution of energy consumption in a region to global
warming is largely a function of its carbon intensity, total
fuel use, and of the efficiency with which it consumes fossil
fuels. Carbon intensity for industrialized countries changes
from 16.3 tonnes carbon per gigajoule (TC-GJ) in 1985 to
15.5 in 2025. In the developing world the change is from
14.2 TC-G] to 15.6.

"3.0.2 Strategies which focus only on one group of

responses should, therefore, be balanced against
alternative abatement options among the energy, industry,
forestry and agricultural sectors, and adaptation options
and other policy goals where applicable at both national
and international levels. Ways should be sought to
account for other countries, and intergenerational issues,
when making policy decisions.

"3.0.1 Because climate change could potentially result
in significant impacts on the global environment and human
activities, it is important to begin considering now what
measures might be taken in response. Working Group I
found that under a “Business-as-Usual” scenario global
average temperature could rise by 0.3 degrees centigrade per
decade; it also found that under the Accelerated Control
Policies Scenario (scenario D) with extremely stringent
emissions reductions the temperature rise could perhaps be
reduced to 0.1 degree centigrade per decade. The RSWG
identified a wide range of options for the international
community to consider. These include measures both to
limit net greenhouse gas emissions and to increase the ability
of society and managed ecosystems to adapt to a changing

those measures aimed at protecting reservoirs such as

that oceans also play an equally important role as sinks
and reservoirs for carbon dioxide. A discussion of both
short and long-term options for each major emissions

"3.0.6 The degree to which options are viable will also vary
considerably depending on the region or country involved. For
each country, the implications of specific options will depend
on its social, environmental, and economic context. Only
through careful analysis of all available options will it be
possible to determine which are best suited to the
circumstances of a particular country or region. Initially, the
highest priority should be to review existing policies with a
view to minimizing conflicts with the goals of climate change
strategies. New policies will be required.

"4.0.2 It also should be recognized that the large,
projected increase in the world population, to as much as ten
billion people during the next century, will be a major factor
in causing the projected increase in global greenhouse gases.
This is because larger populations will be accompanied by
increased consumption of energy and of food, more land
clearing, and other activities, all of which will cause an
increase in net greenhouse gas emission. It is essential,
therefore, that policies designed to deal effectively with the
issue of potential global climate change include strategies
and measures to reduce the rate of growth of the world
population.

"4.1.1 The energy sector plays a vitally important role in
economic well-being and development for all nations. At
the same time, because energy production and use accounts ©
for approximately one half of the radiative forcing from
human activities, energy policies need to ensure that
continued economic growth occurs in a manner that,
globally, conserves the environment for future generations.
However, there is no single, quick-fix technological option
for limiting greenhouse gas emissions from energy sources.
A comprehensive strategy is necessary which deals with
improving efficiency on both the demand and supply sides
as a priority and emphasizes technological research,

encouragement of flexible selection of abatement measures,
frequently offer the possibility of achieving environmental
improvements at lower cost than regulatory mechanisms.
Unlike many regulations, they tend to encourage innovation
and the development of improved technologies and practices
for reducing emissions. Economic mechanisms also have
the potential to provide the signals necessary for more
environmentally sensitive operation of markets. It is
unlikely, however, that economic instruments will be
applicable to all circumstances.

the view that transfer of technologies on a non-commercial
basis is necessary and that specific bilateral and multilateral
arrangements should be established to promote this. Some
other countries where technologies are not owned by the

a function of commercial negotiations. The issue of

"7.3.3. Three factors are considered as potential barriers to

These are: information problems, which can often cause
markets to produce less effective or unfavourable
environmental outcomes: existing measures and institutions,
which can encourage individuals to behave in
environmentally damaging ways; and balancing competing
objectives (social, environmental. and economic). An initial
response strategy may therefore be to address information
problems directly and to review existing measures which
may be barriers. For example, prior to possible adoption of
a system of emission charges, countries should examine
existing subsidies and tax incentives on energy and other
relevant greenhouse-gas-producing sectors.

understanding of the economic and social consequences
of these various approaches. It is evident that further
work is required in all countries, and in ongoing IPCC
work, to fully evaluate the practicality of such measures
and costs and benefits associated with different
mechanisms, especially with their use internationally. It
has, however, been pointed out that an international
system of tradeable permits, or, alternatively, an
international system of emissions charges, could offer the
potential of serving as a cost-efficient main instrument for
achieving a defined target for the reduction of greenhouse
gas emissions.
"	Text
"7.3.9 Finally, it was stressed that in order to share
equitably the economic burdens, implementation of any of
the international economic instruments discussed above
should take into account the circumstances that most
emissions affecting the atmosphere at present originated
in the industrialized countries, where the scope for change
is the greatest, and that, under present conditions,
emissions from developing countries are growing and
may need to grow in order to meet their development
requirements and thus, over time, are likely to represent
an increasingly significant percentage of global emissions.
It is appreciated that each instrument assessed has a role
in meeting greenhouse-gas emission objectives, but the
suitability of particular instruments is dependent on the
particular circumstances and at this stage no measure can
be considered universally superior to any other available
mechanisms.
"	Text
"A system of tradeable emissions permits: An
emission permit system is based on the concept that
the economic costs of attaining a given
environmental goal can be minimized by allowing
for the trading of emissions rights. Once an overall
limit on emissions has been set, emissions
entitlements amounting to that limit could be
provided to emitting sources and free trading of such
entitlements allowed. This would reduce the costs
of meeting a given emission target because: (a) as in
trade, comparative advantages between trading
entities would be maximized; and (b) economic
incentives would be created for the development of
improved greenhouse gas limitation technologies,
sink enhancement, and resource use efficiency
(energy conservation). Concerns with this approach
include the limited experience with this instrument,
the potential scope and size of trading markets and
the need for the development of an administrative
structure not currently in place.

A system of emission charges: Emission charges are
levied on specified emissions depending on their
level of contribution to climate change. Such
charges may provide a means of encouraging
emitters to limit or reduce emissions and provide an
incentive for diverse parties to implement efficient
means of limiting or reducing emissions. Another
advantage of charges is that they generate revenue
which could provide a funding base for further
pollution abatement, research, and administration,
or allow other taxes to be lowered. Concerns with
this approach include the difficulty of deciding on
the basis and size of the tax, and the lack of
certainty that the tax will achieve the agreed
emission reduction target.

Subsidies: Subsidies are aimed at encouraging
environmentally sound actions by lowering their
costs. Subsidies could be used, inter alia, to
encourage the use of energy-efficient equipment
and non-fossil energy sources, and the development
and greater use of environmentally sound
technologies. Concerns with subsidies include the
possible size of the required financial commitment
of governments, the need for careful design, the
need for review, and the international trade aspects
of such measures.

the use of economic sanctions for the enforcement of

insufficient information;
insufficient communication;

limited financial resources.

Insufficient information: Many developing countries
do not have sufficient information on the issue of
potential climate change to appreciate the concern it
evokes elsewhere in the world. Information is often
insufficient with respect to the scientrfic basis for
concern, on the potential physical and socio-economic
impacts of climate change as well as on response
options. This applies not only to scientific milieux but
also to policymakers and public opinion.

Insufficient communication: Even if the situation with
respect to information were to improve, there is the
problem of insufficient internal and external
communication mechanisms for the proper
dissemination of the information on matters related to
climate change.

Limited human resources: Lack of adequate number
of trained personnel in almost all areas ranging from
academic, scientific efforts to applications of
knowledge to food and energy production, to water
management, to human settlements problems, to trade
and economic growth, and to a host of other related
endeavours is common to many developing nations.

of nations will need a sound knowledge base to embark on
the agreement process. This need is especially dire in the case
of the developing countries. Their access to scientific and
other information, and resources will have to be attended to,
if they are to share in. and contribute to, the solution. In the

Similarly, many developing countries do not have sufficient
information to judge how best to achieve energy efficiency,

less used at present, is to designate regional experts to
represent a group of countries. There are drawbacks inherent
in both approaches. Embassy officials may lack the
background information in the issues to take effective part in
meetings, particularly those calling for specific expertise in
science, impacts, policy and legal analyses, problems of
human settlements in coastal and low-lying areas, behavioural
sciences, and cost and economic analyses. In addition, because
IPCC meetings take place in many areas of the globe, it is
difficult to provide for continuity of representation through the

developing countries in IPCC meetings has shown a steady
improvement (see sub-section 2.8 below). Ironically, as the
IPCC succeeds in increasing the participation of developing

funding assistance for participation increases
commensurately. To date, IPCC has not established specific
criteria or priorities by which requests from developing
countries for travel assistance should be considered.

SFr222,510 for travel support for the developing countries
in its 1989 budget estimate. The actual amount spent was
approximately SF 383,904 (see Annex II for a listing of
contributions). This amount paid for 85 trips by 80 experts
to attend the meetings of the Panel, the Bureau, the Working
Groups and their subgroups, and the Special Committee in
1989. The budget for 1990 for similar support is
SFr794,000, which is one half of the IPCC 1990 budget.

institutions, and between institutions themselves will
achieve cost savings and efficiency. This is particularly
indispensable for the smaller countries, including island
nations.

"3.0.3 Advantages of regional co-operation are obvious
for research activities but they are there also for many other
sectors. For example. with regards to energy savings,
countries could benefit from the know-how of regional
“technical centres” which encourage research. Together
they could develop technologies adapted to their particular
situation by sharing their equipment and existing
infrastructures. The creation or strengthening, for example,
of regional “departments” of energy and environment would
assist the mobilization of support and the co-ordination of
research and approaches common to many countries.

"3.0.1 The impacts of climate change will vary from
region to region and nation to nation, as already stated
elsewhere in the Policymaker Summary. Although response
strategies for developing countries have to take into account
the needs for adequate funding and safer technologies,
country-specific and/or region-specific approaches will be
necessary. For example, response measures that small island
states require could be very different from those for large
industrializing countries within the developing world.
Nevertheless, the discussion in this section is relevant in
general to all developing nations (and, indeed, to all nations)
