One hundred and seventy scientists from 25 countries have

have been involved in the peer review of the draft report
Although, as m any developing scientific topic, there 1s a

There are several natural factors which can change the
balance between the energy absorbed by the Earth and that
emitted by it in the form of longwave infrared radiation
these factors cause the radiative forcing on climate The
most obvious of these 1s a change in the output of energy
from the Sun There is direct evidence of such variability
over the 11-year solar cycle, and longer period changes
may also occur Slow variations in the Earths orbit affect
the seasonal and latitudinal distribution of solar radiation

Naturally occurring greenhouse gases keep the Earth warm
enough to be habitable. By increasing their concentrations,
and by adding new greenhouse gases like chloro-
fluorocarbons (CFCs), humankind is capable of raising the
global-average annual-mean surface-air temperature
(which, for simplicity, is referred to as the “global
temperature""), although we are uncertain about the rate at
which this will occur. Strictly, this is an enhanced
greenhouse effect - above that occurring due to natural
greenhouse gas concentrations; the word ""enhanced"" is
usually omitted, but it should not be forgotten. Other
changes in climate are expected to result, for example
changes in precipitation, and a global warming will cause
sea levels to rise; these are discussed in more detail later.

exception of an increase in the number of intense showers

there 1s no clear evidence that weather variability will
change in the future In the case of temperatures, assuming
no change in variability, but with a modest increase in the
mean, the number of days with temperatures above a given
value at the high end of the distribution will increase

decrease in days with temperatures at the low end of the

the variability of the weather The number of days with a

the forcing factors (for example, greenhouse gases, orbital variations) and other conditions (for example, ice cover,

The climate variables which are commonly used are
concerned mainly with the atmosphere. But, in considering
the climate system we cannot look at the atmosphere alone.
Processes in the atmosphere are strongly coupled to the
Jand surface, to the oceans and to those parts of the Earth
covered with ice (known as the cryosphere). There is also
strong coupling to the biosphere (the vegetation and other
living systems on the land and in the ocean). These five
components (atmosphere, land, ocean, ice and biosphere)
together form the climate system.

"The driving force for weather and climate is energy from
the Sun. The atmosphere and surface of the Earth intercept
solar radiation (in the short-wave, including visible, part of
the spectrum); about a third of it is reflected, the rest is
absorbed. The encrgy absorbed from solar radiation must
be balanced by outgoing radiation from the Earth
(terrestrial radiation); this is in the form of long-wave
invisible infra-red energy. As the amount of outgoing
terrestrial radiation is determined by the temperature of the
Earth, this temperature will adjust until there is a balance
between incoming and outgoing radiation.

"radiation emitted by the warm surface of the Earth is
partially absorbed and then re-emitted out to space by a
number of trace gases in the cooler atmosphere above.
This process adds to the net energy input to the lower

their temperaturc. This is the basic greenhouse effect, the
trace gases are often thought of as acting in a way
somewhat analogous to the glass in a greenhouse. The main
greenhouse gases are not the major constituents, nitrogen
and oxygen, but water vapour (the biggest contributor),
carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and (in recent

"There are several important factors (known as climate
forcing agents) which can change the balance between the

Earth and that emitted by it in the form of long-wave infra-
red radiation - the radiative forcing on climate. The most
obvious of these is a change in the amount or seasonal
distribution of solar radiation which reaches the Earth
(orbital changes were probably responsible for initiating
the ice ages). Any change in the albedo (reflectivity) of the
land, due to desertification or deforestation will also
affect the amount of solar energy absorbed, as will
absorption of solar radiation (and outgoing long-wave
radiation) by aerosols in the lower atmosphere (where
they can be man-made) or the upper atmosphere (where

Global forecasting models concentrate on the circulation
of the atmosphere (for that reason they are often called
atmospheric general circulation models (or atmospheric
GCMs) They are based on equations describing the
atmosphere s basic dynamics, and include descriptions in
simple physical terms (called parameterizations) of the
physical processes Forecasts are made for several days
ahead from an analysis derived from weather observations
Such forecasts are called deterministic weather forecasts
because they describe the detailed weather to be expected
at any place and time on the synoptic scale (of the order of
a few hundred kilometres) They cannot of course, be
deterministic so tar as small scale phenomena, such as
individual shower clouds are concerned

in the atmosphere does not follow a simple exponential
curve, and therefore a single time scale cannot be given to
characterize the whole adjustment process toward a new
equilibrium The two curves in Figure | 2, which represent
simulations of a pulse input of CO2 into the atmosphere

General Circulation Model (GCM)), clearly show that the
initial response (governed mainly by the uptake of CO? by
ocean surface waters) 1s much more rapid than the later
response (influenced by the slow exchange between surface
waters and deeper layers of the oceans) For example, the
first reduction by 50 percent occurs within some 50 years,
whereas the reduction by another 50 percent (to 25 percent

The relative constancy seems surprising in view of the fact
that the atmosphere exchanges about 30 percent of its CO2
with the oceans and biota each year This indicates that the

linked to large-scale changes in the circulation of the ocean

A technique for establishing the global distribution of
surface sources and sinks has been to take global
observations of atmospheric CO? concentration and
Isotopic Composition and to mvert these by means of
atmospheric transport models to deduce spatial and
temporal patterns of surface fluxes (Pearman et al 1983
Pearman and Hyson 1986, Keeling and Heimann 1986)
The observed inter hemispheric CO2 concentration
difference (currently about 3 ppmv) 15 smaller than one
would expect given that nearly all fossil releases occur in
the Northern Hemisphere The results of this approach
suggest that there 1s an unexpectedly large sink in the
Northern Hemisphere equivalent to more than hall of the
fossil fuel CO2 1elease (Enting and Mansbridge 1989

The result from this budget and from other studies 15 that
the estimated emissions exceed the sum of atmospheric
increase plus model-calculated oceanic uptake by a
significant amount The question theretore arises whether
an important mechanism has been overlooked All attempts
to identify such a missing sink in the ocean have
however tailed so far A possible exception 1s that a natural
fluctuation in the oceanic carbon system could have caused
a decreasing atmospheric baseline concentration in the past
few decades, this does not appear hkely in view of the
relative constancy of the pre-industrial CO? concentration
There are possible processes on land which could account
for the missing CO? (but it has not been possible to verily
them) They include the stimulation of vegetative growth
by increasing CO? levels (the CO? fertilization effect) the
possible enhanced productivity of vegetation under warmer
conditions and the direct effect of fertilization from
agricultural fertilizers and from nitrogenous releases into
the atmosphere [1 has been estimated that increased
fertulization by nitrogenous releases could account for a
sequestering of up to a maximum of | GtC per year in
terrestrial ecosystems (Melillo private communication
1990) In addition changed forest management practices
may also result in an increase in the amount of carbon
stored in northern mid-latitude forests The extent to which
mid-latitude terrestrial systems can sequester carbon betore
becoming saturated and ineffective 1s unknown As mid
latitude terrestrial systems become close to saturation and
hence ineftective in sequestering carbon this would allow

Since the start of atmospheric monitoring in 1958, the

must have been a global sink rather than a source during all
these years. Further evidence is provided by the fact that

be increasing (e.g., Pearman and Hyson, 1981: Bacastow et

Loa, Hawaii, the seasonal amplitude has increased by
nearly 20% since 1958. The increase has however, not been
monotonic, and different evaluation methods yield
somewhat different values; still, it is statistically sig-
nificant. This increasing amplitude could point to a
growing productivity (NPP) of the terrestrial ecosystems,
and to a sequestering of carbon by a growing biomass,
provided the increase in biomass is not fully compensated
by respiration. It is important to note that such a change
does not necessarily indicate increased productivity or
increased storage of carbon (Pearman and Hyson, 1981;

Small imbalances in natural exchange fluxes are reflected
in interannual CO? concentration fluctuations (+1 ppmv
over 1-2 years). They are correlated with the El Nifio-
Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon (Thompson et
al., 1986; Keeling et al., 1989a), which suggests a relation
to changes in the equatorial Pacific Occan, where normally
the upwelling causes a high pCO2 peak and outgassing of
C02 into the aimosphere. However, a closer inspection
shows that this cannot be the dominating mechanism, since
during El Nifio, the equatorial pCO? peak disappears
(Feely et al., 1987), while atmospheric CO2 grows more
strongly than normally. Alternatively, processes in the land
biosphere, perhaps in response to climatic events connected
with ENSO events, may be responsible. This explanation is
supported by one set of stable carbon isotope dala on
atmospheric CO2 (Keeling et al., 1989a); but not supported
by a second set (Goodman and Francey, 1988).

To stabilize, and then reduce, the current atmospheric
concentrations of the fully halogenated CFCs (e.g , 11, 12
and 113) would require approximate reductions in
emissions of 70-75%, 75-85%, and 85-95%, respectively.
Future emissions of CFCs and CClq will, most likely, be
eliminated or be significantly lower than today's because
the stringency, scope, and timing of international
regulations on chlorine and bromine containing chemicals,
(1.e., the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the
Ozone Layer) are currently being renegotiated. However,
the atmospheric concentrations of CFCs 11, 12 and 113
will still be significant (30 - 40% of current) for at least the

Stratospheric O3 1s an important constituent of the Earth s
atmosphere It protects the Earth's surface from harmful
solar ultraviolet radiation and 1t plays an important role in
controlling the temperature structure of the stratosphere by
absorbing both incoming solar ultraviolet radiation and
outgoing terrestrial (longwave) radiation Part of the
absorbed outgoing longwave radiation 1s then re-radiated
back to the surface-troposphere system Reductions in
stratospheric 03 can modify the surface temperature via
two competing processes more solar radiation 1s
transmitted to the surface-troposphere system, thereby
contributing to a surface warming, on the other hand, the
cooler stratosphere (due to decreased solar and long-wave
absorption) emits less to the troposphere which would tend
to cool the surface The solar warming (a function of total
column amount of 03) and longwave cooling (a function of

Tropospheric O3 is a greenhouse gas, of particular
importance in the upper troposphere in the tropics and sub-
tropics.lts distribution is controlled by a complex interplay
between chemical, radiative, and dynamical processes.
Ozone is: (i) transported down into the troposphere from
the stratosphere; (ii) destroyed by vegetative surfaces; (iii)
produced by the photo-oxidation of CO, CH4, and NMHC
in the presence of reactive nitrogen oxides (NOx), and (iv)
destroyed by uv-photolysis and by reaction with hydrogen
oxide radicals (HO2) (Danielsen, 1968; MahIman and

Ozone in the troposphere has a lifetime of at most several
weeks, hence its concentration varies with latitude,
longitude, altitude and season (Chatfield and Harrison,
1977; Logan, 1985). Near the surface, monthly mean
concentrations (30 - 50 ppbv) are highest in spring and
summer at northern mid-latitudes (Figure 1.15). In the
middle troposphere at northern mid-latitudes values are
highest also in spring and summer, 60 - 65 ppbv. The
summer maximum results from photo-oxidation of O3
precursors from fossil fuel combustion and industrial
activity (Isaksen et al., 1978; Fishman et al., 1985; Logan

other latitudes, in part because the stratospheric source is

thorough analysis of data from 10 ground-based Umkehr

broadly consistent with theoretical predictions. Based on

indications of a continuing stratospheric O3 decrease since

anthropogenic emissions dominate over natural emissions
by about a factor of ten or even more (Galloway et al,

from the Sun 1s scattered and absorbed, and thermal
infrared radiation is absorbed and emitted by the Earth-
atmosphere system If the climate system 1s in equilibrium,
then the absorbed solar energy 1s exactly balanced by
radiation emitted to space by the Earth and atmosphere
Any factor that 1s able to perturb this balance, and thus
potentially alter the climate, 1s called a radiative forcing
agent
"	Text
"In order to formulate policy on the possible limitations of
greenhouse gas emissions (undertaken within IPCC by
Working Group III), it 1s essential to know how abatement
of the emissions of each of the trace gases will affect global
climate forcing in the future This information can then be
used for calculations of the cost-effectiveness of reductions,
eg CO? emissions compared to CH4 emissions There 1s
no ideal index that can be used for each gas, but values of
one index, the Global Warming Potential, are derived in
this section Research now under way will enable such
indices to be refined
"	Text
"However, we can also use the estimates of radiative
forcing from this section in their own right, by looking at
the relative contribution from each of the agents - and in
particular the greenhouse gases The advantage of dealing
with radiative forcing, rather than climate change itself, 1s
that we can estimate the former with a great deal more
certainty than we can estimate the latter In the context of
policy formulation, the relative importance of these agents
1s of major significance in assessing the effectiveness of
response strategies The radiative forcing 1s expressed as a

change in flux of energy in Wm-2

" 

The most obvious of these 1s the amount of solar radiation
reaching the Earth and this ts known to vary on a wide
range of time scales The amount of solar radiation
absorbed by the Earth atmosphere system 1s determined by
the extent to which the atmosphere and Earths surface
reflect the radiation (their albedo) and by the quantities of
gases such as ovone and water vapour in the atmosphere

The albedo of the Earth's surface can be affected by
changes in the land surface, eg, desertification The
planetary albedo can be altered by changes tn the amount of
aerosol particles in the atmosphere, in the stratosphere the
dominant source 15 from volcanic eruptions, while in the
troposphere the source can be either natural or man-made

Of particular relevance to concerns about climate change
are the changes in radiative forcing which arise from the
Increases in the concentration of radiatively active trace
gases ( greenhouse gases ) in the troposphere and
stratosphere described in Section | These changes in
concentration will come about when their emissions or
removal mechanisms are changed s0 that the atmospheric
concentrations are no longer in equilibrium with the
sources and sinks of the gas The growing concentrations of
greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane
chlorofluorocarbons and nitrous oxide are of particular
concern In addition, indirect effects on radiative forcing
can result from molecules that may not themselves be
greenhouse gases but which lead to chemical reactions
which create greenhouse gases For example, indirect
effects are believed to be altering the distribution of

"The strength of the greenhouse effect can be gauged by
the difference between the effective emitting temperature

globally-averaged surface temperature (about 285K) The

Relative molecular forcing. This gives the relative
forcing on a molecule-per-molecule basis of the
different species It 1s normally quoted relative to
COz2 Since the forcing of some atmospheric species
{most notably CO2, methane and nitrous oxide) 1s
markedly non-linear in absorber amount, this relative
forcing will be dependent on the concentration
changes for which the calculations are performed A
small change in current atmospheric concentrations 15
generally used This measure emphasises that the
contributions of individual gases must not be judged
on the basis of concentration alone The relative
molecular forcing will be considered in Section 2 2 4
Relative mass forcing. This 1s similar to the relative
molecular forcing but 1s relative on a kilogram per
kilogram basis It 15 related to the relative molecular
forcing by the molecular weights of the gases
concerned It will also be considered in Section 2 2 4
Contribution of past, present and future changes
in trace gas concentration. This measure, which can
either be relative or absolute calculates the
contribution to radiative forcing over some given
period due to observed past or present changes, or
scenarios of future changes in trace gas

The existing concentrations of a particular gas dictate the

gases such as the halocarbons, where the naturally
occurring concentrations are zero or very small, their
forcing 15 close to linear in concentration for present-day
concentrations Gases such as methane and nitrous oxide
are present in such quantities that significant absorption 15

approximately proportional to the square root of their
concentration Furthermore, there 1s significant overlap
between some of the infrared absorption bands of methane
and nitrous oxide which must be carefully considered in
calculations of forcing For carbon dioxide, as has already
been mentioned, parts of the spectrum are already so
opaque that additional molecules of carbon dioxide are
even less effective, the forcing 1s found to be logarithmic in

the bands of molecules which dictates the strength of the

have bands with intensities about an order of magnitude or
more greater, on a molecule-per-molecule basis, than the

"mixed in the atmosphere, the climatic effect of ozone
depends strongly on tts vertical distribution throughout the
troposphere and stratosphere, as well as on its total amount
in the atmosphere Ozone ts a primary absorber of solar
radiation in the stratosphere where it 1s directly responsible
for the increase in temperature with altitude. Ozone 1s also
an important absorber of infrared radiation It 1s the balance
between these radiative processes that determines the net
effect of ozone on climate. Changes 1n ozone in the upper
troposphere and lower stratosphere (below 25 km) are most
effective in determining the change in radiative forcing,
with increased ozone leading to an increased radiative
forcing which would be expected to warm the surface (e g ,
Wang and Sze, 1980, Lacis et al , 1990) This 1s because
the greenhouse effect 1s directly proportional to the
temperature contrast between the level of emission and the
levels at which radiation 1s absorbed This contrast 15
greatest near the tropopause where temperatures are at a
minimum compared to the surface. Above about 30 km,
added ozone causes a decrease in surface temperature
because it absorbs extra solar radiation, effectively robbing
the troposphere of direct solar energy that would otherwise
warm the surface (Lacis et al, 1990).

The hydroxyl radical, OH 15 not itself a greenhouse gas
but it 1s extremely important in the troposphere as a
chemical scavenger Reactions with OH largely control the
atmospheric lifetime, and, therefore the concentrations of
many gases important in determining climate change
These gases include CH4 CO _ the non-methane
hydrocarbons (NMHCs), the hydrochlorofluorocarbons
(HCFCs), the hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) CH3CCI3, H2S
SO? and dimethyl sulphide (DMS) Thei reaction with OH
also affects the production of tropospheric ozone, as well as
determining the amounts of these compounds teaching the
stratosphere, where these species can cause Changes in the
ozone distribution In turn the reactions of these gases
with OH also affects its atmospheric concentration The
increase in tropospheric water vapour concentration
expected as a result of global warming would also increase
photochemical production of OH It 1s important that
effects of interaction between OH and the greenhouse
gases, along with the resulting impact on atmospheric
lifetimes of these gases, be accounted for in analysing the
possible state of future climate

Early attempts at defining a concept of global warming
potentials (Lashof and Ahuja 1990, Rodhe, 1990, Derwent
1990) are based on the instantaneous emissions into the
atmosphere of a quantity of a particular ace gas The
trace gas concentration then declines with time and whilst it
1s present in the atmosphere it generates a gieenhouse
watming If its decline 1s due to atmospheric chemistry
processes then the products of these reactions may
generate an additional gicenhouse warming A realistic
emissions scenatio can be thought of as due to a large
number of instantancous releases of dilferent magnitudes
over an extended time period and some emission abatement
scenarios can be evaluated using this concept

The figures presented in Table 2 8 should be considered
preliminary only Considerable uncertainty exists as to the
lifetimes of methane and many of the halocarbons, due to
difticulties in modelling the chemistry of the troposphere
The specification of a single lifetime for carbon dioxide
also presents difficulties, this 15 an approximation of the
actual lifetime due to the transfer of CO2 amongst the
dulterent reservoirs The detailed time behaviour of a pulse
of carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere has been
described using an ocean-atmosphere-biosphere carbon
dioxide model (Siegenthaler, 1983) The added carbon
dioxide declines in a markedly non-exponential manner

followed by a more gradual decline over the next 100 years
and a rather slow decline over the thousand year time-scale

years for the second, about 250 years (see Section | 2 I for
details) A single lifetime figure defined by the decline to

with specifying the lifetime of CO? means that presentation
of the GWP relative to CO? may not be the ideal choice,

Bearing in mind the uncertainties inherent in Table 2 8, a
number of important points are rarsed by the results
Firstly, over a twenty year period a kilogram of all the
proposed CFC substitutes, with the exception of the
relatively short lived HCFC-123 and HFC-152a, cause
more than a three order of magnitude greater warming than
I kg of CO? However, tor a number of these gases (but nor
the live CFCs themselves) the global warming potential
reduces markedly as the integration time 1s increased, this
implies that over the long term, the replacement
compounds should have a much lower global warming
effect than the CFCs they replace, for the same levels of
emissions In addition, the shorter lifetimes imply that
abrupt changes tn total emissions would impact on the
actual global warming relatively quickly A further
Important point 1s that in terms of radiative forcing over the
short-term the effect of the CFC substitutes 1s considerably
greater than indicated by the halocarbon global warming
potential (GWP) of Fisher et al (1990) For example, over
a 20 year period, the eftect of | kg emission of HCFC 22
contiibutes only slightly less to the radiative forcing than
the same amount of CFC-11, even though its ‘infinite’ GWP
1s about 035 This 1s because, on a kg-per-kg basis,
HCFC 22 1s a stronger greenhouse gas than CFC-11 (Table

to estimate the greenhouse warming potential of these
indirect effects because changes in tropospheric ozone
depend, in a complex and non-linear manner on the
concentrations of a range of species The limited spatial
resolution in current tropospheric chemistry models means
that estimates of increased tropospheric ozone production
are highly model-dependent Furthermore, the radiative
impacts of tropospheric ozone changes depend markedly on
their spatial distribution As a result, the GWP values for
the secondary greenhouse gases have been provided as first

Variations in climate on time-scales ranging from 10,000 to
100,000 years, including the major glacial/interglacial
cycles during the Quaternary period, are believed to be
imitiated by variations in the Earths orbital parameters
which in turn influence the latitudinal and seasonal
variation of solar energy received by the Earth (the
Milankovitch Effect) Although the covariation of these
orbital parameters and the Earths climate provides a
compelling argument in favour of this theory, internal
feedback processes have to be invoked to explain the
observed climatic variations, in particular the amplitude of
the dominating 100,000 year period one such feedback
could be the changes to the carbon cycle and the

Howeve1 over longer periods these solar changes would

the different time-scales on which the two mechanisms
operate Because of oceanic thermal inertia (see Section 6),
and because of the relatively short time scale of the forcing
changes associated with the solar cycle only a small
fraction of possible temperature changes due to this source

Cloud droplets form exclusively through condensation of
water vapour on cloud condensation nucle: (CCN): 1.e.,
aerosol particles. Therefore, the size, number and the
chemical composition of aerosol particles, as well as
updraughts, determine the number of cloud droplets. As a
consequence, continental clouds, especially over populated
regions, have a higher droplet concentration (by a factor of

"In summary, there 1s little doubt that major volcanic
eruptions contribute to the interannual variability of the
global temperature record. There 1s no convincing
evidence, however, of longer time-scale effects. In the
future, the effects of volcanic eruptions will continue to
impose small year-to-year fluctuations on the global mean
temperature. Furthermoie, a period of sustained intense
volcanic activity could partially offset or delay the effects
of warming due to increased concentrations of greenhouse
gases. However, such a period would be plainly evident

There have also been claims of longer time-scale effects
For example, Hammer et al. (1980) and Porter (1987) have
claimed that the climate fluctuations of the last millenium,
including events like the Little Ice Age, were due largely to
variations in explosive volcanic activity, and various
authors have suggested that decadal time-scale trends 1n the
twentieth century were strongly mfluenced by the changing
frequencies of large erupuons (SCOPE, 1986). These
claims are highly contentious and generally based on
debatable evidence For mstance, a major problem in such
studies 1s that there 1s no agreed record of past volcanic
forcing - alternative records published in the literature
correlate poorly. In consequence, the statistical evidence
for a low frequency volcanic effect 1s poor (Wigley et al
1986) but not negligible (Schonwiese, 1988); since the
lifetime of the aerosols in the stratosphere 1s only a few
years, such an effect would require frequent explosive
eruptions to cause long time-scale fluctuations in aerosol
loading

reflectivities (albedo) of clouds in overcast conditions
(Coakley ct al, 1987) While the :n-situ observations
(Radke et al , 1990) have shown the expected increase in
droplet numbers and decrease in droplet sizes for the
contaminated clouds, they have also shown an increase in
cloud liquid water content (LWC) in contradiction to the
suggestion by Twomey et al , (1984) that the changes in the
droplet size distribution will leave the LWC nearly
unchanged Albrecht (1989) has suggested that the LWC
increase could be due to the suppression of drizzle in the

therefore may have an even more complicated influence

Many facets of the climate system are not well understood,

directly due to interactive climate feedback mechanisms
They can either amplify or damp the climate response
resulting from a given climate forcing (Cess and Potter,

towards global-mean quantities, and the interpretation of
climate change as a two-stage process forcing and

quantities and to changes from one equilibrium climate to

temperature distributions over the continents, the monsoon

established, but more work 15 needed to establish equations
for the biological pump The latter must parametrize the
biological diversity, which varies regionally and seasonally
and 15 likely to vary as the climate changes, ideally the
equations themselves must cope with such changes without
introducing too many variables Candidate sets of such
robust biological equations have been tested in one-
dimensional models and are now being used in ocean
circulation models with encouraging results It seems likely
that they will have to be incorporated into eddy-resolving
ocean circulation models in order to avoid biases due to the
patchy growth of plankton They will also have to pay
special attention to the seasonal boundary layer (the
biologists euphotic zone) and its interaction with the
permanent thermocline in order to deal with nutrient and
carbon dioxide recirculation Such models are comp-
ulationally expensive and complete global models based on
these equations will have to await the arrival of more
powerful supercomputers later in the 1990s Besides the
biological organic carbon pump the biological calcium
carbonate counter pump and interactrons between the
seawater and carbon sediment pools must be considered
First results with models which include the organic carbon
pump with a sediment icservoir indicate the importance of
these processes (Heinze and Maier Reimer 1989)

"4.1 INTRODUCTION

Climate models, and those based on general circulation
models (GCMs) in particular, are mathematical
formulations of atmosphere, ocean and land surface
processes that are based on classical physical principles
They represent a unique and potentially powerful tool for
the study of the climatic changes thal may result from
increased concentrations of CO? and other greenhouse
gases in the atmosphere Such models are the only
available means to consider simultaneously the wide range
of interacting physical processes that characterize the
climate system, and their objective numerical solution
provides an opportunity to examine the nature of both past
and possible future climates under a variety of conditions
In order to evaluate such model estimates properly
however, it 1s necessary to validate the simulations against
the observed climate, and thereby to identify their
systematic errors, particularly errors common to several
models These errors or model biases must be taken into
account in evaluating the estimates of future climate
changes Additional caution arises from the GCMs’
relatively crude treatment of the ocean and their neglect of
other potentially-important elements of the climate system
such as the upper atmosphere and atmospheric chemical
and surface biological processes While it 1s to be expected
that GCMs will gradually improve there will always be a
range of uncertainty associated with their results, the
scientific challenge to climate modelling ts to make these
uncertainties as small as possible

availability of appropriate observed data For some
variables of interest, observed data are unavailable, or are

to traditional climatological data, useful compilations of 2

"41.2 Methods and Problems of Model Validation

The questions we need to answer in this assessment
concern the suitability of individual models for estimating
climate change The response of modelled climate to a
perturbation of the radiative or other forcing has been
shown to depend on the control climate How serious can a
model's errors be for its response to a perturbation still to
be credible? Mitchell et al (1987) pointed out that it may
be possible to allow for some discrepancies between
simulated and observed climates, provided the patterns are
sufficiently alike that relevant physical mechanisms can be
identified For example, they found that with increased
CO? and increased surface temperatures, precipitation
tended to increase where it was already heavy, so that 'f a
rainbelt was differently located in two models, the response
patterns could differ but still have the same implications for
the teal climate change However, although a perfect
simulation may not be required, 11 1 clear that the better the
simulation the more reliable the conclusions concerning
climate change that may be made Also, since, as discussed
in Section 3, the magnitude of the response depends on the
feedbacks, these feedbacks should be realistically rep-
resented in the models Thus, in selecting model variables
with which to validate atmospheric Components of the
climate models, we considered the following

simulated with some skill by models, especially the daily
variance (eg Figure 43) in particular, the variability
maxima over the eastern Atlantic and northeast Pacific are
well simulated and in the Southern Hemisphere high

GFDL result 1s consistent with expermments with the CCC

degree this reflects the dominance of thermal forcing of the

Summer temperatures over land are strongly affected by
the availability of soil moisture (see Section 4 3 3), the
absence of evaporative cooling generates higher surface
temperature and lower pressure as in the “dry land”
experiment of Shukla and Mintz (1982) This effect 1s

While models successfully simulate the major features of

Of etrors common to many models, the most notable 1s the
general coldness of the simulated atmosphere, simulated
temperatures in the polar upper troposphere and lower
stratosphere are too low in summer by more than 10°C

"are a number of errors in common, The most prominent of
these are excessive westerlies above the summer jet,
especially in the SH, and above and poleward of the winter
jet. In consequence, some models fail to close the winter
subtropical jet (i.e., separate it from the stratospheric polar
night jet). This problem can also be alleviated by
improving the vertical resolution (Cariolle et al., (1990)).
In the NH the closure error is smallest in the more recent
simulations using higher resolution models (e.g., Figure
4.5(b)), although this improvement may owe more to the
inclusion of gravity wave drag than to the improvement in
resolution. Dyson (1985) found that improved resolution
helped to intensify the NH summer jet; this result is also
evident here, as shown by Figure 4.6, which allows
comparison of the observed and modelled meridional
profiles of wind at 200 hPa. At this level the June-July-
August jet in the SH is realistically simulated in most

large pole to equator gradients which models simulate well

models shown, the ocean surface temperatures are main-

each model displays systematic errors, there are few errors

Figure 4 9(a) over southeast Asia) Another, common to
most models, 15 that temperatures are too high over the
Antarctic ice sheet (Figure 4 8), in winter at least, this can
be attributed to the models’ difficulty in resolving the
shallow cold surface layer In summer, errors in the
simulated ground wetness appear to be responsible for
many of the temperature errors over the continents

One way to validate coupled models 1s to analyse the
simulated interannual variability, a fundamental source of
which ts associated with the El Nifto - Southern Oscillation
(ENSO) (see also Section 451) The current generation of
coarse-grid coupled models has been shown to be capable
of simulating some aspects of the ENSO phenomenon
(Sperber et al 1987 Meehl 1990 Philander et al 1989)
although the simulated intensity 1s in general too weak
Ultimately a coupled climate model should be verified by
its simulation of the observed evolution of the atmosphere
and ocean over historical umes For hypothetical future
rates of COQ increase current coupled GCMs at Jeast
indicate that the patterns of the climate 5 transient response
are likely to be substantially different in at least some
ocean regions from those given in equilibrium simulations

In view of such errors, a practical decision faces those
designing coupled models On the one hand they can
decide that the systematic errors, while serious in terms of
the control integration do not prevent the useful
interpretation of results from sensitivity experiments On
the other hand, they may consider that the systematic crrors
Tepresent a significant bias in the control run and would
affect the results of sensitivity experiments to an
unacceptable degree The alternative then 1s to somehow
adjust for the errors in the control run to provide a more
realistic basic state for sensitivity experiments Such
techniques have been devised and are variously called flux
correction” (Sausen et al 1988) or flux adjustment
(Manabe and Stouffer, 1988) These methods effectively
remove a large part of the systematic errors and such
coupled simulations are close: to observed conditions
However, since the correction terms are additive the
coupled model can sull exhibit duft and the flux conection

differences in the climatic response as simulated by GCMs

There has been a general reduction in the errors in more
recent models as a result of increased resolution, changes in
the parameterization of convection, cloudiness and surface
processes, and the introduction of parameterizations of
gravity wave drag In addition to the conclusions drawn
from the validation of atmospheric model control
simulations, our overall confidence in the models is
increased by their relatively high level of accuracy when
used for short and medium-range weather prediction, by
their portrayal of low-frequency atmospheric variability
such as the atmospheric response to realistic sea surface
temperature anomalies (also referred to above), and by
their ability to simulate aspects of the climate at selected
times during the last 18,000 years Further confidence in
atmospheric models would be obtained by their successful

This somewhat selective review of the performance of
current global climate models has shown that there 1s
considerable skill in the simulation of the present day
climate by atmospheric general circulation models in the
portrayal of the large-scale distribution of the pressure,
temperature, wind and precipitation in both summer and
winter As discussed in Section 412 the responses to
peiturbations can be given credence, provided simulated
and observed patterns are sufficiently similar for
conesponding features and mechanisms to be identified
Recent models appear to satisfy this condition over most of
the globe Although quantification of this conclusion 15
difficult it 1s supported by the skill demonstrated by
atmospheric models in simulating, firstly, the circulation
and taintall changes associated with the El Nifio ocean
temperature anomalies and, secondly, the rainfall

‘Although the ten year atmospheric data set for 1963-73

considerably improved data sets Indeed, many data sets

by global forecasting centres as a by-product of their
operational data assimilation, although changes 1n forecast

accuracy of climate models through both increased
resolution and improved parameterization of small-scale
processes, especially the treatment of convection, clouds

sea-ice behaviour in oceanic GCMs Much further
experience needs to be gained in the design of coupled
models in order to avoid the equally unsatisfactory choices
of accepting a progressive climatic drift or of empirically
correcting the behaviour of the upper ocean These
improvements and the associated extended simulations will
require substantial amounts of computer time, along with
increased coordination and cooperation among the world’s
climate modelling community Data from satellite
programmes, such as EOS, and from field experiments are
needed to provide more complete data sets for specifying
land surface characteristics, for initialisation and validation
of ocean simulations and to improve parameterizations Of

"Secondly, different areas of the world respond at
different rates to the gradual increase in greenhouse gases
Over most of the ocean, the response to the increase in
radiative heating will be relatively rapid, as little of the
extra heat will penetrate below the thermocline at about
500m (see Section 6) On the other hand, in parts of the
northern North Atlantic and the high latitude southern
ocean, particularly in winter, the extra heat will be mixed
down to several kilometres, significantly reducing the rate
of warming and consequently the warming reached at any
given time In other words, the geographical patterns of the
equilibrium warming may differ from patterns of the time-
dependent warming as it evolves in time This applies both
to model simulations and palaeo-climatic analogues

"Assessed ?

Over 20 simulations of the equilibrium response to
doubling CO? using general circulation models (GCMs)
coupled to mixed-layer oceans have been carried out by 9
modelling groups (Table 3 2a) All those cited involved
global models with realistic geography, a mixed layer
ocean and a seasonal cycle of insolation The more recent
studies include a prescribed seasonally-varying oceanic
heating (Section 3) Models 13 20 and 21 in Table 3 2a
also prescribe a heat convergence under sea ice Clearly it
1s not possible here to show results from all 20 or so
experiments, so some way of condensing the available data
must be chosen We have chosen not to average the results

as there are aspects of each model which are misleading

Nor 1s it reasonable to choose a best model as a par-
ticular model may be more reliable than another for one
climatic parameter but not for another Moreover a result
which ts common to most models 1s not necessarily the
most reliable - 1t may merely reflect the fact that many
models use similar (possibly erroneous) representations of
complex atmospheric processes

Third, there is a further temperature albedo feedback over
the northern extra-tropical continents in spring due to the
reduced extent and earlier melting of highly reflective
snow-cover. Fourth, the warming is confined to near the
surface. Thus the increase in outgoing long-wave radiation
(at the top of the atmosphere) for cach degree of warming
is small relative to lower latitudes, where the warming is
mixed throughout the troposphere. As a result, a larger
warming is required in high latitudes to counterbalance the
increase in downward radiation due to the increase in
greenhouse gases. Finally, there is increased latent-heat
release in high latitudes because of the stronger flux of
moisture from the tropics (see Section 3).

Where the land surface becomes sufficiently dry to restrict
evaporation, further drying reduces evaporation and hence
evaporative cooling, leading to further warming of the
surface (Figure 5.5). The reduction in evaporation may also
produce a reduction in low cloud (for example, Manabe
and Wetherald, 1987), further enhancing the surface
warming (Figure 5.5). In one model, (Washington and
Meehl, 1984; Meehl and Washington, 1989) the land
surface becomes generally wetter in these latitudes in
summer, reducing the warming. This is probably due to the

All models simulate a substantially moister atmosphere
(increased specific humidity). Precipitation occurs in
regions of lower level convergence, including the mid-
latitude storm tracks and the inter-tropical convergence
zone (ITCZ), where moist inflowing air is forced to ascend,
cool and precipitate to remove the resulting super-
saturation. The increases in atmospheric moisture will lead
to a greater flux of moisture into these regions and hence
increased precipitation provided there are no large
compensational changes in circulation. The high resolution
models (Table 3.2a, entries 20-22) give an increase of 10 to
20% in precipitation averaged over land between 35 and
55°N.

The saturation vapour pressure of water increases non-
linearly with temperature, so that at higher temperature,
proportionally more of the increase in radiative heating of
the surface is used to increase evaporation rather than to
raise surface temperature. As a result, the surface warming
is reduced relative to the global mean because of enhanced.
evaporative cooling. The enhanced evaporation is ass-
ociated with increased tropical precipitation (see Section
5.2.2.2). Thus the warming of the upper troposphere in the
tropics is greater than the global mean due to increased
latent-heat release (Figure 5.2), Note that the magnitude of
the warming in the tropics in those models with a similar
global mean warming varies by a factor of almost 2 (Figure
5.2). The reasons for this are probably differences in the
treatment of convection (Schlesinger and Mitchell, 1987;
Cunnington and Mitchell, 1990) (the vertical transfer of
heat and moisture on scales smaller than the model grid), in
the choice of cloud radiative parameters (Cess and
Potter,1988) and the distribution of model layers in the
vertical (Wetherald and Manabe, 1988). Some of these
factors have been discussed further in Section 3.

Although there is good agreement among the most recent
simulations in this respect, confidence in the reliability of
the simulated changes is low in view of the simplified
representation of the land surface. In the three high
resolution models, the reduction in soil moisture averaged
over 35 to 55°N ranges from 17 to 23%. The reasons for
this drying are discussed in more detail below. In three of
the simulations that do not produce such a drying (Table
3.2a: entries 6, 7, 16), the soil in the control simulation is
excessively dry. In the other two (Table 3.2a, entries 11,
12), it has been argued that the simulated changes are
equivalent to increased frequency of drought in these
latitudes (Rind et al., 1989a).

In most models, the soil over much of mid-latitudes (35
to 55°N) is close to saturation in spring in both the 1xCO2
and 2xCO2 simulations, so that on enhancing CO, the
summer drying starts carlier but from the same level (for
example, Figure 5.10a). In a minority of models (Meehl
and Washington, 1988,1989: Mitchell and Warrilow. 1987)
the soil in the 1xCO2 formulation is not close to saturation,
and the enhanced winter precipitation in 2xCO2 simulation
is stored in the soil. Hence, although the summer drying in
the 2xCO2 experiments starts earlier, it starts from a higher
level than in the control simulation, and may not become
drier before next winter season (Figure 5.10b). Even in
these models, the surface becomes drier in the southern
mid-latitudes in the 2xCO? simulations.

"models needs to be considered carefully. Hence the water
and energy budgets in this region have been analysed in
some detail. In the control simulation, all models produce
a maximum in soil moisture in winter and spring, and a
rapid drying to a minimum in summer (Figure 5.9c). With
doubled CO2, enhanced winter precipitation (and snow
melt) (Figure 5.9a) produce higher soil moisture levels into
early spring (Figure 5.9c). In the warmer climate, snow
melt and the summer drying begin earlier, reducing the soil
moisture levels in summer relative to the present climate
(Figures 5.8d, e, f, 5.9c). The drying in the 2xCOQ2
simulation is also more rapid due to the higher
temperatures and in some regions 15 reinforced by reduced
precipitation. Reductions in surface moisture may lead to a
drying of the boundary layer, reduced low cloud and hence
further warming and drying of the surface (Manabe and
Wetherald, 1987) (see also Figure 5.5).

The soil is close to saturation in late winter (spring m
higher latitudes) in the control simulation, so that
increased precipitation in the anomaly simulation ts
run off and is not stored in the soul.

The greater the seasonal variation of soil moisture in
the control simulation, the greater the change due to
an earlier start to the drying season (for example
Figure 5.9c). Of course, if the soil moisture content in
the simulation of present climate is very small in
summer, it cannot decrease much. A comparison of
model and field data over the Soviet Union
(Vinnikov and Yeserkepova, 1989) indicates that the
simulated soil moisture levels in some models are
much too low in summer. The simulated reduction in
soil moisture due to doubling CO? tn such models
would then be less than if higher, more realistic
levels of soil moisture were present in the contol

The increases in CO2 and other ""greenhouse"" gases
increase the downward longwave flux at the surface
(Section 2). Both the upward flux of longwave radiation
and evaporative cooling increase non-linearly with surface
temperature. One would expect the increased downward
radiation to produce a larger warming at night (when the
surface temperature and hence the rate of increase of
radiative and evaporative cooling with increase in
temperature is smaller) than during the day, and hence a
reduction in diurnal range.

over greater depth (Hansen ct al., 1989) in a warmer

"Changes in the variability and frequency of cxtreme events
may have more impact than changes in mean climate.
Changes in the frequency of extreme events may occur ina
number of ways. For example, the shape of the frequency
distribution may not be altered, but the mcan may change,
leading to a sharp increase in the frequency of extreme
events at one end of the frequency distribution, and a
decrease at the other end (Mearns et al., 1984,1990; Parry
and Carter, 1985; Wigley, 1985; Pittock, 1989) (Figure
5,12a). Thus the general warming due to increases in
greenhouse gases will undoubtedly lead to more frequent
""hot"" days and fewer ""cold"" days. Conversely, the mean
may be unchanged, but the shape of the frequency
distribution may alter. For example, the standard deviation
(spread) of the frequency distribution may increase
producing more extreme events at both ends of the
distribution (Figure 5.12b). Of course, the mean and the
spread of the frequency distribution may change
simultaneously.

Several factors must be borne in mind when deriving
changes in standard deviations from numerical simulations.
First, a much longer simulation is required to establish that
changes in standard deviations, as opposed to changes in
means, are statistically significant. Most studies to date use
periods of 15 years or less, which is barely sufficient to
establish that the simulated changes in standard deviation
are unlikely to have occurred by chance. Second, although
the models exhibit a measure of agreement on the larger
scales, there is much less agreement on the regional scale,
especially in the case of precipitation. Hence, only the
changes in standard deviations on the larger scales will be
considered. Third, information on changes in variability is
not as readily available as information on changes in
means. Thus the conclusions below are based on a much
smaller number of simulations than is generally the case in
Section 5.2. Finally, the coupled atmosphere mixed layer
models used to derive the results in this section do not
reproduce the El Nifio - Southern Oscillation phenomena
which are the main source of interannual variability in the
tropics (Section 7.9.1).

High resolution atmospheiic models used for weather

although the hotzontal resolution used (~100km) 1s

et al (1989) found that the quality of the forecasts
decreased as horizontal resolution was decreased but even
so the simulated maximum wind intensity decreased little
until much coarser (above 400 km) resolution was reached
At the lower resolution used tin climate studies (250 km or
gieater) one can choose objective criteria (for example, a
warm core and low level vorticity and surface pressure
depression gicater than specified limits) to select
appropriate cyclones and compare their seasonal and
geoglaphical disuibutions with those of observed tropical
storms In both respects the simulated storms resemble
those observed over most oceans (Manabe et al 1970,
Bengtsson et al 1985 Broccoli and Manabe 1990 (Table
32a entry 21) ) Thus although global models cannot
resolve hurricanes explicitly they give a surprisingly good
indication of the regions of potential hurricane formation

"The intluence of global warming on annual precipitation
over the continents appears to be more complicated than
for air temperature During the mid-Holocene, precipitation
was greater than at present over most of the northern
continents although there were decreases in some regions
of the European territory of the Soviet Union, as well as in
some cential regions of the United States (Figure 7 4b)
Reconstructions of the Pliocene climate indicate that
precipitation increased over all land areas for which date
ale available, particularly in a number of aieas that are now
deserts (Figure 7 2b) Fort this epoch, the mean latitudinal
increase in annual precipitation over the continents of the
Northern Hemisphere seems to show little dependence on
latitude, averaging approximately 20 cm yr! The tentative
results for the Eemian for which data are less complete,
indicate that precipitation considerably exceeded the
modern value in all regions for which data exist As
discussed in Section 7 the data used in this study have
various limitations, and tt 15 possible that the need for
datable material to survive has introduced a bias against
finding evidence of aridity

The changes in forcing during the Pliocene are less well

present, but whether or not they were as high as double
present concentrations 1s disputed (Section 7 22 1) Other
factors, such as a lower Himalayan massif and an open
isthmus of Panama (which would have profoundly affected
he circulation of the North Atlantic) are likely to have
iltered the climate in those regions The geographical
distribution of data for the Pliocene are limited and there

"Jnus, numerical simulations OF the mid-horocene
and Eemian produce tncreases im precipitation in
much of the arid subtropics because the enhanced
summer insolation intensifies the summer monsoon
circulations Again, on simple physical grounds and
on the basis of model simulations (for example
Kutzbach and Guetter, 1986, Mitchell et al 1988) it
appears that the changes in precipitation in the arid
subtropics during these epochs are due to orbital
changes

The palaeo climatic data suggest that the warming
(in the Northern Hemisphere) in summer would be
greatest in high latitudes whereas in model sim-
ulations with increased CO? (this section) or orbital
perturbations (for example Kutzhach and Guctter

1986 Mitchell etal 1988) the warming ts small in
high lantudes in summer

The simulated changes may be in error (though there
18 a plausible physical explanation) o1 the palaeo

interpreted

"The palaeo climatic data suggest a cooling over
large areas of the topics whereas COZ simulations
produce a substantial warming

A cooling 1s consistent with the reduction in
insolation in the tropics during the mid-Holocene and
Eemian, and is also reproduced in numetical
stmulations in which the orbital perturbations have
been imposed (for example, Kutzbach and Guetter
1986, Mitchell et al, 1988) As noted above inc

reases in CO2 produce a radiative warming of the
tropics, whereas the relevant changes in orbital
properties produce a radiative cooling Thus on both
simple physical giounds and on the basis of model
simulations, the palaeo-climatic reconstructions are
probably misleading 1n this 1espect

by the surface, in addition to heating the soil, provides

strongly affect evaporation and atmospheric heating and so

concentrated on the climatic impact that might arise from
complete deforestation of South America and, 1n particular,

1984, Dickinson and Hendetson-Sellers, 1988, Lean and

contains about half of the worlds tropical rainforests and
plays a signilicant role in the climate of that region It 1s
estimated that approximately half of the local rainfall 1s
derived fiom local evaporation (Salat: et al , 1978) The
remainder 1s derived from moisture advected from the

Finally the oceans and sea-ice constitute a major source
of uncertainty about which more is said in Section 6. Here
it has been shown that the distribution of sea-ice and
changes in sea-ice extent have a dominant influence on
local temperature change, especially in winter. Most of the
models considered here ignore salinity effects and possible
changes in ocean heat and ice transport: some ignore ocean

   

 

transport altogether. The inclusion of a more complete
representation of the ocean may modify the simulated
changes in sea-ice described here, and changes in ocean
circulation could produce pronounced local anomalies in
SST particularly in the neighbourhood of the major current
systems or the main areas of deep water formation, with
profound effects on the local climate.

For a steadily increasing forcing, the global rise in

equilibrium rise corresponding to the instantaneous forcing
for a time that is earlier by a fixed offset For an
atmospheric model with temperature sensitivity 4°C for a
doubling of COd, this fraction ts approximately 66% with
an offset of 11 years In rough terms, the response 1s about
60% of the current equilibrium value Extrapolation using
robust scaling principles indicates that for a sensitivity of
1 5°C the corresponding values are 85% 6 years and 80%
respectively

The regional patterns of temperature and precipitation
change generally resemble those of an equilibrium
simulation for an atmospheric model, though uniformly
reduced in magnitude Exceptional regions are around
Antarctica and in the northern North Atlantic, where the
warming 1s much less

"6.1.1 Why Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Models ?
The responses discussed in Section 5 are for a radiative
forcing that is constant for the few years required for the
atmosphere and the surface of the ocean to achieve a new
equilibrium fotlowing an abrupt change Though the
atmospheric models are detailed and highly developed, the
treatment of the ocean 1s quite primitive However, when
greenhouse gas concentrations are changing continuously,
the thermal capacity of the oceans will delay and
effectively reduce the observed climatic response At a
given time, the realized global average temperature will
reflect only part of the equilibrium change for the
corresponding instantaneous value of the forcing Of the
remainder, part 1s delayed by storage in the stably stratified
layers of the upper ocean and 1s realized within a few
decades or perhaps a century, but another part 1s effectively
invisible for many centuries or longer, until the heating of
the deep ocean begins to influence surface temperature In
addition, the ocean currents can redistribute the greenhouse
warming spatially, leading to regional modifications of the
equilibrium computations Furthermore, even without
changes 1n the radiative forcing, interactions between the
ocean and atmosphere can cause interannual and inter-
decadal fluctuations that can mask longer term climate
change for a while

A more faithful representation 1s to treat the additional
heat associated with forcing by changing greenhouse gases
as a passive tracer which 1s advected by three-dimensional
currents and mixed by specified diffusion coefficients
intended to represent the sub-grid scale processes These
currents and mixing coefficients may be obtained from a
GCM simulating the present climate and ocean circulation,
including the buoyancy field, in a dynamically consistent
manner Using appropriate sources, the distributions of
transient and other tracers such as temperature-salinity
relationships, 4c tritium and CFCs are then inferred as a
separate, computationally relatively inexpensive, step and
compared with observations Poorly known parameters
such as the horizontal and vertical diffusion coefficients are
typically adjusted to improve the fit In box-diffusion
models, which generally have a much coarser resolution,
the currents and mixing are inferred directly from tracer
distributions or are chosen to represent the aggregated
effect of transports within a more detailed GCM Though
potential temperature (used to measure the heat content per
unit volume) affects the buoyancy of sea-water and hence
1s a dynamically active variable, a number of studies (e g ,
Bryan et al , 1984) have demonstrated that small, thermally
driven, perturbations in a GCM do 1n fact behave in the
aggregate very much as a passive tracer This approach 15
useful for predicting small changes in climate from the
present, in which the ocean currents and mixing co-
efficients themselves are assumed not to vary in a

With the exception of the few time-dependent
simulations described in Sections 6 3 - 6 6, perceptions of
the geographical patterns of CO2-induced climate change
have been shaped mainly by a generation of atmospheric
GCMs coupled to simple mixed layer or slab ocean models
(see review by Schlesinger and Mitchell, 1987) With these
specified-depth mixed-layer models having no computed
ocean heat transport, CO? was instantaneously doubled and
the models run to equilibrium Averages taken at the end of

moisture changes showed a tendency for drying of mid-

show that this cooling was a consequence of alterations in

"A qualitative explanation for these model results seems to
lie in strong vertical pathways between the surface and
intermediate to deep water in the northern North Atlantic
and in the Southern Ocean In this coupled ocean-
atmosphere model, for which the radiative transfer to space
1s relatively inefficient, downward transfer of additional
heat through these pathways short circuits up to 40% of the
global greenhouse gas forcing to the deep water, where it
mixes into a large volume causing a small local temp-
erature rise Thence it 15 carried away by deep currents and
1s sequestered for many centuries As discussed in Section
6 6 below, for a less sensitive atmospheric model the
fraction short circuited would be smaller Over time-scales
of 10-20 years, the remainder of the greenhouse warming
brings the upper few hundred meters of most of the world
ocean (the seasonal boundary layer and upper part of
permanent thermocline) to approximate local equilibrium
The pattern of temperature change resembles that of the
equilibrium calculation though with a response
commensurate with the reduced effective global forcing,
because non-local processes in the atmosphere dominate
inter-regional heat transfers in the surface layers of the

Present coarse resolution coupled ocean-atmosphere
general circulation models are yielding results that are
broadly consistent with existing understanding of the
general circulation of the ocean and of the atmospheric
climate system With increasing computer power and
improved data and understanding based upon planned
ocean observation programs, it may well be possible within
the next decade to resolve the most serious of the
remaining technical issues and achieve more realistic
simulations of the time-dependent coupled ocean-
atmosphere system responding to a variety of greenhouse
forcing scenarios Meanwhile, useful estimates of global
warming under a variety of different forcing scenarios may
be made using highly simplified upwelling-diffusion
models of the ocean, and with tracer simulations using
GCM reconstructions of the existing ocean circulation

Precipitation has varied greatly in sub-Saharan Africa
on time scales of decades.

Precipitation has progressively increased in the Soviet

"The instrumental record of surface temperatures over the land
and oceans remains sparse until after the middle of the nmeteenth
century. It is common, therefore, to emphasize trends in the global
instrumental record from the late nineteenth century. The record
suggests a global (combined land and ocean) average warming of
0.45+0.15°C since the late nineteenth century. with an estimated
small (less than 0.05°C) exaggeration due to urbantsation in the
land component. The greater part of the global temperature
increase was measured prior to the mid- 1940s. Global warming is
indicated by three independent data sets: am temperatures over
land, air temperatures over the ocean, and sea surface
temperatures. The latter two data sets show only a small lag
compared with land temperatures. A mathed retreat of mountain
glaciers in all parts of the world since the end of the nineteenth

century provides further evidence of warming.

"Observational and palaeo-climatic evidence indicates that the
Earth's climate has varied in the past on time scales ranging from
many millions of years down to a few years. Over the last two
mullion years, glacial-interglacial cycles have occurred on a ume
scale of 100,000 years, with large changes in ice volume and sea
level. During this time, average global surface temperatures
appear to have varied by about 5-7°C. Since the end of the last ice
age, about 10,000 BP, globally averaged surface temperatures
have fluctuated over a range of up to 2°C on time scales of
centuries or more. Such fluctuations include the Holocene
Optimum around 5,000-6,000 years ago. the shorter Medieval
Warm Period around 1000 AD (which may not have been global)
and the Little Ice Age which ended only in the middle to fate
nineteenth century. Details are often poorly known because
palaeo-climatic data are frequently sparse.

this glacial period continental size 1ce sheets covered
much of North America and Scandinavia and world sea

cause of the recurring glaciations is belicved to be
variations in seasonal radiation receipts in the Northern
Hemisphere These variations are due to small changes in
the distance of the Earth from the sun m given seasons and
slow changes in the angle of the tlt of the Earths axis
which affects the amplitude of the seasonal msolation
These Milankovitch orbital effects (Berger, 1980) appear

Variations in carbon dioxide and methane in ice age
cycles are also very important factors, they served to
modify and perhaps amplify the other forcing elfects (see
Section 1) However, there 1 evidence that rapid changes
in climate have occurred on time scales of about a century
which cannot be directly related to orbital forcing o1 to
changes in atmospheric composition The most dramatic of
these events was the Younger Diyas cold episode which
involved an abrupt reversal of the general warming trend in
progress around 10500 BP as the last episode of
continental glaciation came to aclose ~The Younger Dryas
was an event of global significance it was clearly observed
in New Zealand (Salinger 1989) though 1s influence may
not have extended to all parts of the globe (Rind et al
1986) There is as yet no consensus on the reasons for this
climatic reversal which lasted about 500 years and ended
very suddenly However because the signal was strongest
around the North Atlantic Ocean suggestions have been
made that the climatic reversal had its physical origin in
large changes tn the sea surface temperature (SST) of the
North Atlantic Ocean One possibility 15 that the cooling
may have resulted from reduced deep water production in
the North Atlantic following large scale melting of the
Laurentide Ice sheet and the resulting influx of huge
amounts of low density freshwater into the northern North
Atlantic ocean (Broecker et al 1985) Consequential
changes in the global oceame circulation may have
occued (Street Perrott and Perrott 1990) which may have
involved variations in the strength of the thermohaline

Cooler episodes have been associated with glacial

advances in alpine regions of the world, such neo-glacial'
episodes have been increasingly common in the last few
thousand years Of particulai interest 1s the most recent
cold event, the Little Ice Age , which resulted in extensive
glacial advances in almost all alpine regions of the world
between 150 and 450 years ago (Grove, 1988) so that
glaciers were more extensive 100-200 years ago than now
nearly everywhere (Figure 72) Although not a period of
continuously cold climate, the Little Ice Age was probably
the coolest and most globally extensive cool period since
the Younger Dryas In a few regions, alpine glaciers
advanced down-valley even further than during the last
glaciation (for example, Miller, 1976) Some have argued
that an increase in explosive volcanism was responsible for
the coolness (for example Hammer, 1977, Porter, 1986),
others claim a connection between glacier advances and
reductions in solar activity (Wigley and Kelly, 1989) such
as the Maunder and Sporer solar activity minima (Eddy,
1976), but see also Pittock (1983) At present, there 15 no

only been partly allowed for in the USA temperature data

these changes in the thermometric record. Since many of
the changes in exposure took place during the nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries, that part of the record is most
likely to be affected. Recently, Parker (1990) has reviewed
the earlier thermometer exposures, and how they evolved,
in many different countries. The effects of exposure
changes vary regionally (by country) and seasonally. Thus
tropical temperatures prior to the late 1920s appear to be
too high because of the placement of thermometers in
cages situated in open sheds. There is also evidence that
for the mid-latitudes prior to about 1880 summer
temperatures may be too high and winter temperatures toc
low due to the use of poorly screened exposures. This
includes the widespread practice of exposing thermometers
on the north walls of buildings. These effects have not yet
been accounted for in existing analyses (see Sectior

the effects of biases due to increased urbanisation tn the

because of different assumptions about the mix of wooden

Despite recommendations by Maury (1858) to use wooden
buckets with the thermometer inserted for four to five
minutes, such buckets may have been much less used in
practice (Toynbee, 1874, correspondence with the Danish
Meteorological Seivice, 1989) possibly because of damage

No corrections have been applied to the SST data trom
1942 to date Despite published discussions about the
differences between bucket and engine intake SST data
in this period (for example James and Fox 1972) there are
several reasons why it ts believed that no further
corrections, with one reservation noted below are needed
Firstly the anomalies in Figure 7 8 are calculated from the
mean conditions in 1951 1980 So only relative changes in
the mix of data since 1942 are important Secondly many
of the modern ' buckets are insulated (Folland and Parker
1990) so that they cool much less than canvas buckets A
comparison of about two million bucket and four million
engine intake data for 1975-1981 (Bottomley et al 1990)
reveals a global mean difference of only 0 08°C the engine
intake data being the warmer Thus a substantial change in
the mix of data types (currently about 25 30% buckets)
must occur before an appreciable aitificial change will
occur m Figure 78 This conclusion ts strongly supported

Marine air temperatures are a valuable test of the
accuracy of SSTs after the early 1890s Biases of day-time
marine air temperatures are so numerous and difficult to
overcome that only night time marine air temperatures
have been used The biases arise during the day because
overheating of the thermometers and screens by solat
insolation has changed as ships have changed their physical
characteristics (Folland et al 1984) On the other hand
appreciable biases of night time data are currently believed
to be confined to the nineteenth century and much of the
Second World War Night marine an temperatures have
been found to be much too high relative to SST o1 to
modetn values in certain regions and seasons before 1894

SSTs but subsequently (except in 1941 19-45) night marine
air temperature data consutute independent evidence
everywhere although corrections are also made tor the
increasing heights of ship decks (Bottomley et al £990)

In summary, the overall increase of temperature since
the minctcenth century can be estimated as follows Tt 1s
probable that a small residual positive bias remains in the
land surface temperatures due to increasing urbanisation
(Section 7411) However, the contribution of the
urbanisation bias 1s at least halved in recent decades in the
combined ocean and land data, so it 1s unlikely to exceed
005°C From Figure 7 10d, allowing for areas never
adequately sampled, we estimate that varying data
coverage produces an uncertainty in trend of at least
+005°C We also recognise the existence of several other
sources of bias, highlighted by some disagreements
between individual analyses, but are uncertain as to their
true sign Therefore our best estimates of the lower and
upper limits of global warming between the late nineteenth
century and the 1980s are about 0 3°C and not more than
06°C respectively, slightly less than most previous

important problem concerns the reliability of measurements
of wind speed that are an essential component of
evaporation estimates Oceanic wind speeds have
apparently increased in recent decades However, Cardone

can be explained by changes in the methods of estimating

Quantitative estimates of precipitation over the oceans are
limited to the toptcs where they are still very approximate
The mean temperature of the upper surfaces of convective
clouds deduced trom satellite measurements of outgoing
long wave thermal radiation (OLR) are used to estimate
mean rainfall over periods of days upwards The colder the
clouds the less 1s OLR and the heavier the rainfall (Section
4 gives references) Nitta and Yamada (1989) found a
significant downward trend in OLR averaged over the
global equatorial belt 10°N to 10°S between 1974 and
1987, implying an increase of equatorial rainfall over that
time Arkin and Chelliah (1990) have investigated Nitta
and Yamadas results for this Report They find that
inhomogeneities in the OLR data are sufficiently serious to
cast doubt on Nitta and Yamadas conclusions However
the latters claim that equatorial SST has risen over this
period seems justified (Flohn and Kapala, 1989, and
Figures 7 12 and 7 13) This trend 1s likely to result in
increased deep convection and more rainfall there (Gadgil

A severe problem for analysing multi decadal variations
of precipitation lies in the fact that the efficiency of the
collection of precipitation by raingauges varies with gauge
siting construction and climate (Sevruk 1982, Folland
1988, Legates and Willmott 1990) Major influences ate
the wind speed during rain, the size distribution of
precipitation particle sizes, and the exposure of the
raingauge site Fortunately, appropiate climatological
averages of the first two, highly vartable quantittes can be
used to assess usefully their effects over a long enough
period (Folland, 1988, Appendix |) Collection efficiency
has tended to increase as operational practices have
improved, often in poorly documented ways that may give
artificial upward trends in precipitauion in some regions
Thus precipitatton data are not completely compatible
between countries due to the lack of agreed standards Of
particular concern 1s the measurement of snowfall from
conventional gauges where errors of at least 40% 1n long
term collection efficiency can occur When precipitation
erlors are expressed as a percentage of the true rainfall it ts
not surprising that they tend to be greatest in high latitude
windy, climates and least in wet equatorial regions

no aerodynamic corrections were thought necessary im

Despite these large biases, comparisons of data sels over

20 years. Iceland (Einarsson, 1984) and Spitzbergen began
to warm after about 1917 (Lamb, 1977), whereas
Greenland and Northern Canada did not warm until the
mid-1920s (Rogers, 1985). When both Greenland and

"The early twentieth century cooling of the Northern
Hemisphere oceans (Figure 7.8) was accompanied by a
period of intensified westerlies in the extratropical
Northern Hemisphere, especially in the Atlantic sector, that
affected most of the year, An extensive discussion is given
in Lamb (1977). The global warming which took place in
the 1920s and 1930s (Figure 7.10) was largest in the
extratropical North Atlantic and in the Arctic (Figure 7.12),
and coincided with the latter part of the period of intense
westcrlies. The westerly epoch is regarded as finishing
around 1938 (Makrogiannis et al., 1982). The effects of the
enhanced westerlies on surface climate were clearest in
winter when there was an absence of very cold outbreaks
over Europe and winters were persistently mild. Rogers
(1985) noted that the best correlation between temperatures
in Europe and wind direction is with the westerly
component, largely reflecting whether or not the
encroaching air masses have had an oceanic moderating
influence imposed on them. Figure 7.22 shows an index of
westerly flow expressed as the difference in atmospheric
pressure measured at mean sea level between the Azores
and Iceland in winter, High index epochs have stronger or
more frequent westerly flow across the extratropical North
Atlantic, Also shown is the air temperature anomaly over
northern Burope and the adjacent seas from 45°N-60°N and
5°W-35°E in winter. The inter-decadal variations of the
pressure index are strikingly large, with weakest flow
centred around the late 1960s (less westerlies) and a return
to a stronger westerlies recently (Fiohn et al., 1990).
Wallen (1986) notes that the period of intense westerly
flow also affected summer temperatures in western Europe,
making them generally cooler between the late 1890s and
about 1920, giving striking decreases in the differences

a much larger increase of annual cloud cover during the

decrease in the percentage of possible sunshine The large
increase of cloudiness may be attributed to the inclusion of
the obscuring effects of smoke, haze, dust, and fog in cloud

"Clouds modify both the shortwave (solar) and longwave
(terrestrial) radiation, the former by reflection and the latter
by absorption. Therefore they may cause a net warming or
cooling of global temperature, depending on their type,
distribution, coverage, and radiative characteristics

Ramanathan et al. (1989) show that with today's

"jiations, and the spatial variability associated with
horizontal gradients. A pervasive problem for assessments
of changes in the temporal variability of climate is the
establishment of a reference level about which to calculate
that variability. For example, the results of an investigation
to determine whether the variability of monthly mean
values was changing could give different results depending
on how the average, or baseline, climate was calculated. If
the climate was changing, calculations of variability would
depend on whether a fixed baseline was used or whether it
was allowed to change smoothly or discontinuously.
Additionally, attempts to identify whether the number of
extremes is decreasing or increasing may be critically
dependent on the definition of the threshold value above
which an extreme is defined. An attempt was made for this
Report to estimate changes in the number of extremes of
monthly average temperature values for a globally
distributed set of about 150 stations, all having at least 60
years of record. The results were found to be very sensitive
to the threshold chosen to define the extreme, and to the
baseline climatology selected, so that no firm deductions
about changes in extremes or variability were possible.

Tropical cyclones derive their energy mainly from the
latent heat contained in the water vapour evaporated from
the oceans As a general rule, for tropical cyclones to be
sustained, SSTs must be at or above 26°C to 27°C at the
present time Such values are confined to the tropics, as
well as some subtropical regions in summer and autumn
The high temperatures must extend through a sufficient
depth of ocean that the wind and wave action of the storm
itself does not prematurely dissipate its energy source For
a tropical cyclone to develop, its parent disturbance must
be about 7° of latitude or more from the equator Many
other influences on tropical cyclones exist which are only
partly understood Thus ENSO modulates the frequency of
tropical storms in some regions for example over the
north-west Pacific, mainly south of Japan (Li, 1985,
Yoshino, 1990), East China (Fu and Ye, 1988) and in the
central and southwest Pacific (Revell and Gaulter 1986)

important to answer this question, because detecting the

The word ""detection has been used to iefer to the
identification of a significant change in climate (Such as an
upward trend in global mean temperature) However

identifying a change m climate 1s not enough for us to
claim that we have detected the enhanced gicenhouse
effect, even if statistical methods suggest that the change 1s
statistically significant (1e extremely unlikely to have
occurred by chance) To claim detection in a useful and
practical way, we must not only identify a climatic change,
but we must attribute at least part of such a change to the

enhanced greenhouse effect It 15 in this stricter sense that
the word ""detection 1s used here Detection requires that
the observed changes in climate are in accord with detailed
model predictions of the enhanced greenhouse effect,

Global-mean temperature has increased by around 0 3-
06°C over the past 80-100 years (see Section 7) At the
same time, greenhouse gas concentrations have increased
substantially (Section 1) Is the warming consistent with
these increases? To answer this question we must model
the effects of these concentration changes on global-mean
temperature and compare the results with the observations
Because of computing constraints and because of the
relative inflexibility of coupled ocean atmosphere GCMs
we cannot use such models for this purpose Instead we
must use an upwelling-diffusion climate model to account
for damping or lag effect of the oceans (see Section 6}
The response of such a model 1s determined mainly by the
climate sensitivity (AT2,) the magnitude of ocean mixing
(specified by a diffusion coefficient K) and the ratio of the
temperature change in the regions of sinking watet relative
to the global-mean change (m) Uncertainties in these
parameters can be accounted for by using a range of values

From this discussion, one may conclude that an

climate record, even though tt cannot yet be reliably
detected above the noise of natural climatic variability The
goal of any detection strategy must be to achieve much
more than this It must seek to establish the credibility of

our uncertainty in the value of the climate sensitivity

Predicted signals depend on the models used to produce

strongly to large signal uncertainties Some insights into
these uncertainties may also be gained from studies of
model results in attempting to simulate the present-day

predicted signal (eg. Mitchell et al, 1987) Such
uncertainties tend to be largest at the regional scale because

to feedback effects associated with sea-ice and snow cover

issue for two reasons First, the variability of temperatures

Increasing greenhouse gas concentrations are expected to
cause (and have caused) a rise in global-mean sea level

due partly to oceanic thermal expansion and partly to
melting of land-based ice masses (see Section 9) Because
of the strong dependence of sea level rise on global mean
temperature change, this element, like global mean pre-
cipitation, cannot be considered as an independent variable

Observations show that global-mean sea level has risen
over the past 100 years, but the magnitude of the rise 15
uncertain by a factor of at least two (see Section 9) As far
as it can be judged, there has been a positive thermal
expansion component of this sea level mse Observational
evidence (e g , Meier, 1984, Wood, 1988) shows that there
has been a general long term retreat of small glaciers (but
with marked regional and shorter time-scale variability)
and this process has no doubt contributed to sea level rise
Both thermal expansion and the melting of small glaciers
are consistent with global warming, but neither provides
any independent information about the cause of the

temperature and salinity were everywhere 0°C and 35 o/oo,

"have to be removed The issue 1s how to do so

In the future, the inherent ambiguity between land and
ocean level changes in a tide gauge record will be solved
by the use of advanced geodetic methods, but such data are
not available for present analysis (Carter et al, 1989) In
lieu of new geodetic data, one approach adopted by recent
analyses has been to model explicitly the expected
geology-induced MSL changes at each tide gauge site by
the use of ancillary Holocene data (e g , molluscs, corals,
peats Gornitz et al , 1982, Gornitz and Lebedeff, 1987) or
by the use of geodynamic models of the Earth (Peltier and
Tushingham, 1989, 1990) The other approach 15 simply to
assemble a sufficiently broad geographical spread of
records such that (it 1s hoped) the net contribution of land
movements reduces to zero (Barnett 1983 1984 1988)

Instead for the present assessment a simple upwelling-
diffusion energy-balance climate model 1s used Typically
this type of model represents the worlds land and oceans
by a few boxes and complicated processes of oceanic
mixing are simplified in one or more parameters ({o1
review see Hoffert and Flannery 1985) Such a model was
used to estimate the transrent global warming (see Sections
6 and 8 for other results and Section 8 for the justification
for using this type of model) The inclusion of expansion
coefficients in the model (varying with depth and possibly
latitude) allows the sea level changes to be estimated as
well In order to maintain consistency throughout this
assessment both past and future (see below) thermal
expansion effects are also estimated with this modelling
technique beating in mind that tull understanding of the
dynamic processes and their effects on the depths and

Although the positive and negative contributions to the
mass budget of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets
noted in Table 9.3 sum up to zero, it is actually unknown
how close the ice sheets are to equilibrium (a more detailed
discussion is given below). This introduces the problem .of
choosing an initial state for model integrations to estimate
future sea level. In a previous assessment (Ocrlemans,
1989), the year AD 1850 was taken as a starting point, and
it was suggested to simply add the ""unexplained part” of
past sea level rise to the calculated future contributions
from thermal expansion and land ice. The unexplained
trend can also be associated with long-term changes of the
ice sheets, but also to unknown tectonic effects. We return
to this particular problem later.

The main published estimate of the contribution of
retreating glaciers to past sea level rise is that of Meier
(1984). In his analysis, Meier assumed that the magnitude
of the long-term changes, for which data are sparse, are
proportional to the difference between summer and winter
balance, for which data are more abundant. This allowed
extrapolation of measurements on a few glaciers to a
world-wide scale. Meier estimated that during the period
1900-1961, glacier retreat contributed 2.8 cm, or 0.46 +
0.26 mm yr’, to global sea level rise. By using data from
three well-documented glaciers in temperate climate
regions, Meier also extrapolated the record to encompass
1885-1974. This gives an average rate of sea level rise
which is somewhat less than 0.46 mm yrl.

From Table 9.3 a notable difference between the
Greenland and Antarctic ice is evident. On Greenland there
is significant ablation (melting and runoff, evaporation); on
Antarctica ablation is a negligible component in the total
mass budget. This is also reflected in the altitude of the
equilibrium line (= zero annual mass gain). It is instructive
to consider this in the light of a generalised mass-balance
curve, where mass gain and loss are plotted as a function of
annual surface air temperature (Figure 9.3). The resulting
mass balance is in metres of water equivalent per year.
Depending on the annual temperature range, ablation
occurs for annual temperatures higher than -15 to -10°C. At
the lower reaches, accumulation increases with temp-
erature, reaches a maximum in the vicinity of the freezing
point and then decreases.

This sensitivity value is broadly supported by mass
balance studies. In the study noted above Meier found a net
glacier mass balance of -0.38 + 0.2m/yr for 25 well studied
glaciers, converting to a sensitivity of -1 m yr per degree
temperature rise. This can be compared to other, more
direct estimates, For example, based on an analysis of 29
years of climatological and mass balance data from the
Hintereisferner (a well-studied glacier in the Austrian
Alps), Greuell (1989) finds a sensitivity of -0.4) m yc! per
degree warming. Kuhn (1990) suggest a global value of
the order of -0.5 m yr! per degree. Sensitivity tests with
an energy balance model for a glacier surface, including
albedo feedback, yields values ranging from -0.45 m yr!
per degree warming for drier climates to -0.7 m yr! per
degree warming for moist climates (Oerlemans, 1990).
Altogether, these studies come up with smaller values than
the -1 m yr""! per degree derived from Meier's estimate of
change in glacier mass balance combined with a figure for
the global temperature change. It is probably the use of this
global temperature change from which the discrepancy
arises. It is known that summer temperature is the
important parameter, and it also seems unlikely that the
mean change over the glacierized regions can be
represented by the global mean temperature. The giobal
sensitivity value inferred by these studies is 1.2+ 0.6 mm

"It must be stressed that the inference of ice mass
discharge from a limited number of sis face velocity
measurements involves many uncertainties The tatio of
surface velocity to vertical mean velocity 1s such an
uncettain factor More seriously outflow velocities vary
dramatically from point to posnt so lateral extrapolauon
and interpolation around the coast introduces very large
errors A comprehensive comparison of catlict estimates of
the surface mass balance was given by Giovinetto and Bull
(1987) Their discussion suggests that the total surface
accumulation over grounded ice 1s not known to an
accuracy better than 10% When considering the net

"changes Analysis of the gas content in the deep Antarctic
ice cores gives an indication of how accumulation varied
between glacial and interglacial conditions (Lorius et al,
1984, Jouzel et al , 1989) In fact, it gives support to the
view that accumulation on the interior 15 roughly
proportional to the saturation mixing ratio of water vapour
in the air above the inversion, as first suggested by Robin
(1977) Another method involves regression analysis on
measured temperatures and accumulation rates (Muszynsk1,
1985, Foituin and Oetlemans 1990) However it 1s not so
clear that a relation between accumulation and temperature
based on spatial vanation can be applied to climatic
change It 1s also possible to use precipitation rates as
predicted by gencral cuculation models of the atmosphere
Although the quality of these models has increased
giadually, simulation of the climate of the polar regions
sull Shows serious shortcomings (Schlesinger, 1990) and
the results concerning glacier mass balance must be
considered with much caution So tar, a systematic
comparison between observed accumulation on the ice
sheets and output from such models has not yet been
published

global glacier melt model (Raper et al , 1990) The model
contains three parameters that have to be prescribed initial
ice volume, a global-mean glacier response time and a
representative glacier temperature sensitivity parameter
The parameter values were chosen to match estimated rates
of glacier volume loss over the last 100 years The model
was run from 1861 to 2100 (implying that, at present,

For the ‘Business-as-Usual” Scenario at year 2030,
global-mean sea level 15 8-29cm higher than today,
with a best-estimate of 18cm At the year 2070, the
rise 18 21-71cm, with a best-estimate of 44cm

Most of the contribution ts estimated to derive from
thermal expansion of the oceans and the increased
melting of mountain glaciers

The Antarctic ice sheet contributes negatively to sea
level due to increased accumulation associated with
warming Increased outflow of ice from the West
Antarctic ice sheet 15 likely to be limited, but the
uncertainty 1s large

The Greenland ice sheet contributes positively to sea
level rise, but part of the enhanced melting and
runoff may be offset by increased snowfall in the
higher parts, so the uncertainties are very large

For the lower forcing scenarios (B,C and D), the sea
level rise projections are similar, at least until the
mid-2Ist century On average these projections are
approximately one-third lower than those of the

Soil respiration in the well drained forests of the boreal
and temperate zones are most often temperature limited
(Van Cleve and Sprague, 1971, Bunnell et al., 1977). Soil
respiration in these systems is rarely limited by moisture
deficit (Anderson, 1973, Schlesinger, 1977, Moore 1984).
In very dry, sub-tropical forests, lack of moisture can limit
decay (Carlyle and U Ba, 1988).

very clearly related to climatic factors, with rates generally

A number of attempts have been made to integrate the
climate and chemical quality controls of litter decay. These
models generally indicate that when AET is low the

35°C (Figure 10.1.b). Above O°C the response of
photosynthesis to temperature is initially rapid, but slows in
the optimum range. In contrast, plant respiration rate tends
to be slow below 20°C, but at higher temperatures it
accelerates rapidly up to the temperature where the rate of
respiration equals the rate of gross photosynthesis, and
there can be no net assimilation of carbon (Figure 10.1.b).
The response of net photosynthesis is broadly similar to
that of overall growth (Figures 10.1.4 and 10.1.b). These

Based on the fossil pollen record, we know that the rate

of movement of forest trees during the Holocene was
generally 25 and 40 km per century (Davis, 1981, Huntley
and Birks, 1983), with the fastest rate 200 km per century
(Ritchie and MacDonald, 1986) With these rates of
movement, most tree species would not be able to change
their geographical distribution as fast as the projected shifts
in suitable climate Zaluski and Davis (unpublished data
cited in Davis, 1988) provide an example based on the past
rates of spread of castern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis)
Under two scenarios for future climate, this species would
not be able to migrate fast enough to occupy much of its
potential range 100 years from now (Figure 10 4)

Prehistorical species migrations were largely unaffected
by human land use In contrast, modern species migrations
may be severely restricted by land use, for example the
progression of the altitudinal treeline with global warming
may be prevented by stock grazing Also, because suitable
habitats for many rare species characteristic of areas of low
productivity are infrequent and fragmentary, being
surrounded by very productive agricultural land it 1s
unlikely that these species will spread naturally even
though climate change will increase thei vigour and
reproductive capacity On the other hand, the migration of
weedy species may be enhanced by land-use change, for

The issue of carbon storage in the mid-latitudes of the
Northern Hemisphere is further complicated by the
increased availability of nutrients such as nitrogen from
agricultural fertilizers and from combustion of fossil fuel
This increased nitrogen availability may result in net
carbon storage in plants and soils (Melillo and Gosz 1983
Peterson and Melillo 1985) In the mid to late 19805
between 70 and 75 Tg N per year have been applied to
agricultural fields mostly in the mid-latitudes of the
Northern Hemisphere (Eichne: 1990) In addition about
18 Tg N have been deposited each year on the forests of
this region in acid precipitation (Melillo et al. 1989) The
addition of this nitrogen to agricultural plots and forests
could be causing an accumulation of between 05 and 10
Pg carbon 1n soils and woody vegetation (Melillo private
communication) However it should be noted that the
greater availability of nitrogen 1s at least for the forests
associated with increasing levels of pollutants which could
reduce plant growth We are uncertain about the net effects

The major sink for CH4 1s reaction with OH in the

magnitude of the sink being im the range of 30 + 15 Tg
CHa4 per year Recent evidence indicates that the
magnitude of the soil sink for CH4 1s controlled by
temperature moisture and some aspects of the nitrogen
cycle in the soil (Steudler et al, 1989) Warmer
temperatures increase CH4 uptake by aerobic soils, while
high soil moisture and high rates of nitrogen turnover in
soils reduce CH4 uptake The argument has been made that
the eutrophication of the soils of the mid latitudes of the
temperate region, with 18 Tg N per year associated with
acid rain, may have reduced CHq uptake by soils enough to
have contributed to the atmospheric increase of CH4
(Melillo et al, 1989) The logic here 1s that either a
reduction in a CH4 sink or an increase in a CH4 source will
lead to an increase in atmospheric CHg4 content since the
gas has such a long lifetime in the atmosphere While this
nitrogen-methane interaction 1s an interesting example of a

Climate change has the potential to change the rate of
delivery of materials from the land to the ocean and such
changes could affect the biological component of ocean
ecosystems For example climate change could lead to an
increase in wind erosion and the delivery of fine particles
by aeolian transport from the continents to the surface
ocean Depending on their composition such particles
could have either a biostumulatory (Martin and Fit7water
1987) or a biotoxic effect on oceanic productivity and other
marine processes Similarly climate change could increase
water-driven erosion and the amount of material
transported to the worlds coastal oceans by river systems
Again the effects will be dependent on the nature of the
terrestrial material

In addition the effect of intensity and frequency of
mixing events on plankton assemblages depends on the
physiology and structure of the plankton Diatoms for
example, are phytoplankton that typically dominate tn cold
nutrient-rich waters such as those that are seasonally well
mixed Because they have high sinking rates diatoms
require a turbulent mixed layer in order to remain
successful constituents of the plankton community
(Smayda, 1970) Duatoms are the preferred food for many
organisms in the marine food web and when replaced by
other types of phytoplankton fish productivity can be
dramatically reduced (Barber and Chavez 1983) The
dense cell encasement of the diatom helps to explain why
these phytoplankton are an important contributo! to the flux

The 1985 atmospheric concentration of methane 1s well
known, and its rate of increase shows that sources and
sinks are not currently in balance Not all aspects of these
methane sources have yet been adequately quantified,
neither has the sink through its reaction with OH Whilst
the accuracies in sources and sinks are adequate in budget
studies to confirm that tropospheric OH can indeed account
tor the observed methane behaviour, the lack of accuracy
has led to problems in the concentration calculations

There is a narrow, model dependent, range of methane,

approaches, causing the part of divergence in model results
Some models have used the methane, carbon monoxide and

all their results to make the 1985 methane concentrations

Although HCFC-22 sources are also all man-made its
lifetime is determmed not by stratospheric photolysis but
by tropospheric OH oxidation However, the temperature
dependence of the oxidation reaction 1s so large that
virtually all of the atmospheric removal occurs in low
latitudes in the lower region of the troposphere and in the
upper stratosphere The models used for this assessment
generally have different 1985 tropospheric OH radical
distributions and the different model formulations lead to
different future OH distributions depending on the
methane, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide emissions
In addition, one of the models employed includes an
additional feedback whereby tuture global warming leads
to increased humidities and hence increased tropospheric
OH radical concentrations Longer lifetimes imply greater
tropospheric build-up of HCFC-22 by the year 2100

"	Title
"WET Valle

In the Business-as-Usual Scenario (Scenario A) the
energy supply ts coal intensive and on the demand side
only modest efficiency increases are achieved Carbon
monoxide controls are modest, deforestation continues
until the tropical forests are depleted and agricultural
emissions of methane and nitrous oxide are uncontrolled
"	Text
"t

For Scenario D a shift to renewables and nuclear in the
first half of the next century reduces the emissions of
carbon dioxide initially more or less stabilizing emissions
in the industrialized countries The scenario shows that
stringent controls in industrialized countries combined with
moderated growth of emissions in developing countries
could stabilize atmospheric concentrations Carbon dioxide
emissions are reduced to 50% of 1985 levels by the middle
of the next century
"	Text
"The Steering Group of the Response Strategies Working
Group (Working Group III) requested the USA and The
Netherlands to develop emissions scenarios for evaluation
by the IPCC Working Group I The scenarios cover the
emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) methane (CH4),
nitrous oxide (N20), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), carbon
monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) irom present up
to the year 2100 Growth of the economy and population
was taken as common for all scenarios Population was
assumed to approach 10 4 billion in the second half of the
next century Economic growth was assumed to be 2-3%
annually in the coming decade in the OECD countries and
3-5 % in the Eastern European and developing countries
The economic growth levels were assumed to decrease
thereafter In order to 1cach the required targets, levels of
technological development and environmental controls
were varied
