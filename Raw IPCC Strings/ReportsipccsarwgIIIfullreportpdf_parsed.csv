In 1992, the Panel reorganized its Working Groups II and
III and committed itself to complete a Second Assessment in
1995, not only updating the information on the same range of
topics as in the First Assessment but also including the new
subject area of technical issues related to the economic as-
pects of climate change. We applaud the IPCC for producing
its Second Assessment Report (SAR) as scheduled. We are
convinced that the SAR, like the earlier IPCC reports, will
become a standard work of reference, widely used by policy-
makers, scientists, and other experts.

the socioeconomic aspects of climate change. It consists of
eleven chapters covering the scope of the analysis, decision
making under uncertainty, equity issues. intertemporal equity
and discounting. applicability of cost and benefit assessments
to climate change, social costs of climate change, response op-
tions, conceptual issues related to estimating mitigation costs,

"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was
jointly established by the World Meteorological Organization
and the United Nations Environment Programme in 1988, in
order to: (i) assess available scientific information on climate
change, (ii) assess the environmental and socioeconomic
impacts of climate change, and (iii) formulate response strate-

August 1990 and served as the basis for negotiating the UN

the socioeconomics of climate change and identifies areas in
which a consensus has emerged on key issues and areas where
differences exist.! The chapters have been arranged to cover
several key issues. First, frameworks for socioeconomic assess-
ment of costs and benefits of action and inaction are described.
Particular attention is given to the applicability of cost-benefit
analysis, the incorporation of equity and social considerations,
and consideration of intergenerational equity issues. Second,
the economic and social benefits of limiting greenhouse gas
emissions and enhancing sinks are reviewed. Third, the eco-
nomic, social, and environmental costs of mitigating green-
house gas emissions are assessed. Next, generic mitigation and
adaptation response options are reviewed, methods for assess-
ing the costs and effectiveness of different response options are
summarized, and integrated assessment techniques are dis-
cussed, Finally. the report provides an economic assessment of
policy instruments to combat climate change.

¢ Earlier mitigation action may increase flexibility in
moving toward stabilization of atmospheric concentra-

paths involves balancing the economic risks of rapid

« Despite its widespread use in economic policy evalua-
tion, Gross Domestic Product is widely recognized to be
an imperfect measure of a society’s well-being, largely
because it fails to account for degradation of the envi-

climate change might affect society’s well-being.

system, attempts to mitigate climate change through ac-

tions of groups of countries.

The literature also emphasizes that delaying responses is
itself a decision involving costs. Some studies suggest that the
cost of delay is small, others emphasize that the costs could
include imposition of risks on all parties (particularly the most
vulnerable), greater utilization of limited atmospheric capac-

insurance capable of sharing climate change risks on a global
basis currently does not exist, one of the important potential
gains from cooperating in a collective framework, such as the
Framework Convention on Climate Change, is that of risk
sharing. Creating an insurance system to cover the risks of cli-
mate change is difficult} and the international community has
not yet established such sophisticated instruments. This does
not preclude, however, future international action to establish
insurance markets sufficient for some international needs.

Decision making related to climate change must take into
account the wrtique characteristics of the “problem”: large un-
certainties (scientific and economic), possible nonlinearities
and irreversibilities, asymmetric distribution of impacts geo-
graphically and temporally, the very long time horizon, and
the global nature of climate change with the associated poten-
tial for free riding. Beyond scientific uncertainties (discussed
in Volume 1) and impact uncertainties (Volume 2), socioeco-
nomic uncertainties relate to estimates of how these changes
will affect human society (including direct economic and
broader welfare impacts) and to the socioeconomic implica-
tions of emission abatement.

Discounting is the principal analytical tool economists use
to compare economic effects that occur at different points in
time. The choice of discount rate is of crucial technical impor-

horizon is extremely long. and mitigation costs tend to come
much earlier than the benefits of avoided damages. The higher
the discount rate, the less future benefits and the more current

There are substantial variations among both developed and
developing countries that are relevant to the application of eq-

Equity arguments can support a variety of proposals to dis-
tribute mitigation costs. Most of them seem to cluster around
two main approaches: equal per capita emission allocations
and allocations based on incremental departures from national
baseline emissions (current or projected). Some proposals
combine these approaches in an effort to incorporate equity
concerns not addressed by relying exclusively on one or the
other approach. The IPCC can clarify scientifically the impli-
cations of different approaches and proposals, but the choice
of particular proposals is a policy judgment.

how best to address the threat of climate change. Concern

Selection of a social discount rate is also a question of val-
ues since it inherently relates the costs of present measures to
possible damages suffered by future generations if no action
is taken.’ How best to choose a discount rate is. and will likely
remain, an unresolved question in economics. Partly as a
consequence. different discount rates are used in different
countries. Analysts typically conduct sensitivity studies using
various discount rates. It should also be recognized that the
social discount rate presupposes that all effects are trans-
formed to their equivalent in consumption, This makes it dif-
ficult to apply to those nonmarket impacts of climate change
which for ethical reasons might not be, or for practical reasons
cannot be. converted into consumption units.

Sustainable development is one approach to intergenera-
tional equity. Sustainable development meets “the needs of
the present without compromising the ability of future genera-
tions to meet their own needs.”+ A consensus exists among
economists that this does not imply that future generations
should inherit a world with at least as much of every resource.
Nevertheless, sustainable development would require that use
of exhaustible natural resources and environmental degrada-
tion be appropriately offset — for example, by an increase in
productive assets sufficient to enable future generations to ob-
tain at least the same standard of living as those alive today.
There are different views in the literature on the extent to
which infrastructure and knowledge, on the one hand, and
natural resources, such as a healthy environment, on the other
hand, are substitutes. This is crucial to applying these con-
cepts. Some analysts stress that there are exhaustible re-
sources that are unique and cannot be substituted for. Others
believe that current generations can compensate future gener-

the rate of increase of welfare derived from higher per capita

The family of analytical techniques for examining eco-
nomic environmental policies and decisions includes tradi-
tional project level cost-benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness
analysis, multicriteria analysis, and decision analysis. Tradi-
tional cost-benefit analysis attempts to compare all costs and
benefits expressed in terms of a common monetary unit. Cost-
effectiveness analysis seeks to find the lowest cost option to
achieve an objective specified using other criteria. Multicrite-
ria analysis is designed to deal with problems where some
benefits and/or costs are measured in nonmonetary units. De-
cision analysis focusses specifically on making decisions un-
der uncertainty.

The choice of the social discount rate for public investment
projects is a matter of policy preference but has a major im-
pact on the economic evaluation of climate change actions.°
For example, in today’s dollars, $1,000 of damage 100 years
from now would be valued at $370 using a 1% discount rate
(near the low end of the range for the first approach) but
would be valued at $7.60 using a 5% discount rate (near the
upper end of the range for the second approach). However, in
cost-effectiveness analyses of policies over short time hori-
zons, the impact of using different discount rates is much
smaller. In all areas analysts should specify the discount
rate(s) they use to facilitate comparison and aggregation of
results.

"Practical application of traditional cost-benefit analysis to
the problem of climate change is therefore difficult because of
the global, regional, and intergenerational nature of the prob-
lem. Estimates of the costs of mitigation options also vary
widely. Furthermore, estimates of potential physical damages
due to climate change also vary widely. In addition, confi-
dence in monetary estimates for important consequences (es-
pecially nonmarket consequences) is low. These uncertainties
and the resolution of uncertainty over time may be decisive
for the choice of strategies to combat climate change. The ob-
jective of decision analysis is to deal with such problems. Fur-
thermore, for some categories of ecological, cultural and human
health impacts, widely accepted economic concepts of value
are not available. To the extent that some impacts and mea-
sures cannot be valued in monetary terms, economists aug-
ment the traditional cost-benefit analysis approach with such
techniques as multicriteria analysis, permitting some quanti-
tative expression of the trade-offs to be made. These tech-
niques do not resolve questions involving equity — for
example, determining who should bear the costs. However,
they provide important information on the incidence of
damage, mitigation, and adaptation costs, and where cost-
effective action might be taken.

both market and nonmarket impacts as far as they can be
quantified at present and, in some cases, adaptation costs.
Damages are expressed in net terms to account for the fact
that there are some beneficial impacts of climate change as
well, which are, however, dominated by the damage costs.
Nonmarket impacts, such as human health, risk of human

There are large differences in the costs of reducing green-
house gas emissions among countries because of their state of
economic development. infrastructure choices, and natural re-
source base. This indicates that international cooperation
could significantly reduce the global cost of reducing emis-
sions. Research suggests that, in principle, substantial savings
would be possible if emissions are reduced where it is cheap-
est to do so. In practice. this requires international mecha-
nisms ensuring appropriate capital flows and technology
transfers between countries. Conversely, a failure to achieve
international cooperation could compromise unilateral at-

If a carbon or carbon-energy tax is used as a policy instru-

revenues, and how the revenues are distributed could dramati-
cally affect the cost of mitigation. If the revenues are distrib-
uted by reducing distortionary taxes in the existing system,
they will help reduce the excess burden of the existing tax
system, potentially yielding an additional economic benefit
(double dividend). For example, those European studies
which are more optimistic regarding the potential for tax recy-
cling show lower and, in some instances, slightly negative
costs. Conversely, inefficient recycling of the tax revenues
could increase costs. For example, if the tax revenues are used
to finance government programmes that yield a lower return
than the private sector investments forgone because of the tax.
then overall costs will increase.

Although relatively new. integrated assessment models of
climate change have evolved rapidly. Integrated assessment
models tend to fall into two categories: policy evaluation and
policy optimization models. Policy evaluation models are rich
in physical detail and have been used to analyze the potential
for deforestation as a consequence of interactions between de-
mographics, agricultural productivity, and economic growth,
and the relationship between climate change and the extent of
potentially malarial regions. Policy optimization models opti-

Global scope. Climate change is a global challenge. which
cannot be answered by a single country acting by itself, Miti-
gation must be coordinated globally, In an interlinked world
economy, not only are the actions of a single country, or group
of countries, not likely to be sufficient to address the problem.
they are likely to be largely offset by actions of other coun-

cutting to increase carbon absorption, the price of lumber will
rise. which may induce other countries to increase cutting in
their forests.

Inertia in the climate system. Atmospheric concentrations.
rather than emissions, determine the amount of warming pro-
jected by climate models. Concentrations change much more
slowly than emissions, meaning that affected nations might
not have enough time to prevent impacts from climate change.
or to mitigate economic impacts after the effects of climate
change become evident. In this respect, the risks of climate
change are unlike those of earthquakes or floods. Long time
lags and the difficulty of detecting climate change increase
the difficulty of reliably determining the magnitude and tim

warming potential (IPCC, 1990a, 1995) that seek to allow ra-

in average temperature might significantly increase weather-
related agricultural losses because, for many crops, extra days
of extreme heat severely limit yields. In Figure 1.1, if the

This chapter sets out the logic of cost-benefit analysis as
applied to climate change. Standard cost-benefit analysis re-
quires (1) a valuing of costs and benefits over time, using will-
ingness to pay as a measure of value and (2) a criterion for
accepting or rejecting proposals.!! The standard criterion is
the compensation principle (Kaldor, 1939. Hic 1939),
which says that if the project yields positive net benefits, then
those made better off could compensate those made worse off
with something extra left over. As long as compensation is
paid, the result is an unambiguous gain in welfare. without the

When faced with a risk, an individual may (1) act to reduce
the chance the unfavourable event will occur; (2) act to reduce
the cost if the event does occur; or (3) spread part of the risk to
others through insurance. In response to the threat of climate
change, nations may (1) reduce the chance that warming will
occur by reducing greenhouse emissions (mitigation); (2) ad-
just to climate change if it does occur (adaptation); or (3)
spread part of the risk through insurance. A porfolio approach
can be expected to include both mitigation and adaptation ac-
tions. These may include government policy reforms, such as
reducing fossil fuel subsidies; increased carbon sequestration;
reducing emissions of methane and other non-CO, green-
house gases; research and development, which can promote
emission reductions or make it easier to adapt to any changes
that do occur; and international actions, including joint imple-
mentation (one country funding emission reductions in an-
other country) and technology transfer.

are correlated, pooling risks is less effective than it is in other
situations. Nonetheless. differences in predicted regional im-

irrespective of who pays the cost, because wealthier individu-

Since, to a first-order approximation, the total carbon load
from oil and gas is fixed (and limited), the total carbon load
on the atmosphere is ultimately primarily related to coal us-
age. From this perspective, an important uncertainty is the
pace at which the cost of the backstop decreases. If it de-

the price decreases slowly, the carbon load could be much

First, for the purposes of analysis, it is useful to separate
efficiency from equity. The implication of this principle is that
because pollution is a social cost of production (and consump-
tion}, everyone should be made to pay the full social costs of
the pollution they generate. Thus, if there is a social cost to a
unit of greenhouse gas emissions, that cost is the same no
matter who produces the emissions, All should pay the full so-
cial costs of their actions, whether rich or poor. In_ this
perspective, corrective (Pigouvian) taxes should be imposed
uniformly.

A simple approach that yields efficiency but does not re-
quire redistribution (and is thus consistent with the two prin-
ciples enunciated above) requires coordinated tax rates so thal
all countries face the same energy prices. This approach
makes the cost of emitting an extra tonne of carbon equal
across all countries, with each country retaining the revenues
thus generated.** The net cost of such a tax (ignoring the ben-
efits from reduced greenhouse gas emissions) will, in general,
be smaller for poorer countries, as a percentage of their na-

that because the industrialized countries have been the major

that costs should be borne, not in proportion to benefits ex-

"No scientific consensus exists on the framework for decid-
ing the burden of financing mitigation and adaptation. At least
four approaches have been proposed to determine how the
burdens of taxation should be shared. One approach looks at
benefits: Just as those who benefit from private goods must
pay for them, those who benefit from a public good should be
made to pay for it. The principle has some force when large
differences in preferences exist within any income class, Pro-
viding a particular public good benefits some of those individ-
uals more than others, creating inequalities in the absence of
benefit taxes. A major problem frequently encountered, par-
ticularly for pure public goods, is that it may be difficult to de-
termine who benefits. It is. in general. possible to ascertain
the economic benefits of mitigation, and these are likely to be
quite unequally distributed. But this principle, by itself, does
not fully determine who should bear the costs. Appropriately
designed mitigation strategies will produce a surplus of bene-
fits over costs, a surplus that must somehow be divided.

General equilibrium issues also arise when production can be
shifted from one period to another, For example, in a partial
equilibrium analysis, a tax on gas or oil raises the price of the
fuel taxed, thereby reducing its consumption, and thus
ated emissions. But over the long run an exhaustible natural
resource like gas or oil has, by definition, an inelastic supply
(ignoring for the moment extraction costs, which, in the case
of gas and oil, are small relative to the price). The general
theory of incidence argues that when a commodity is in in-
elastic supply, a tax affects the price, but not the level of con-
sumption. That is, when all countries impose a tax on gas or
oil, the producer price of oil falls, by an amount just equal to
the tax. The full incidence falls on producers: as a first ap-
proximation, the level of consumption — and thus the level of
emissions — remains unchanged. Obviously, if the tax is large
enough, the price will fall below the cost of extraction for
some output, and supply will be reduced. Moreover, tn the
case of exhaustible natural resources, taxes may affect the
timing of consumption of the oil and gas (Stiglitz, Dasgupta.

is that workers cannot purchase insurance against these kinds

workers leave jobs through natural attrition: if those leaving

But this criterion can also be criticized as inequitable in a
more fundamental sense, since it pays no attention to past ef-
forts at achieving energy efficiency, or to other circumstances
that might affect the implied tax rate. For instance, a country
that during the preceding ten years had made every effort to
increase energy efficiency and switch consumption to less en-

ing its emissions still further. Because the marginal cost curve
for emission reductions rises steeply beyond a certain point,
the implied tax rate would be considerably higher than for a
country that had previously encouraged overconsumption of
energy, for example, by energy subsidies. For the second
country, achieving the emission targets might only require
elimination of the energy subsidies, a policy with an implied
negative tax rate. For a similar reason, countries with large

Once permits are ¢ distributed among the regulated entities,
a market is set up, allowing companies to buy and sell permits
according to their plants’ planned emissions, The cost of pro-
duction then includes not only the costs of conventional
inputs, but also the costs of additional permits to offset addi-
tional emissions. Plants whose cost of mitigation is low will
find it relatively easier to abate pollution rather than to buy
permits. Plants with higher costs of mitigation will have a
greater preference for buying permits than for abating pollu-

"At least three objections have been raised to this idea. First.
conceptually, rationalizing the tax system by reducing the
most distortionary taxes is certainly a worthy goal but is not
equivalent to imposing a carbon tax. Distortions can be re-
duced without a carbon tax, and a carbon tax could be im-
posed without reducing the existing distortions. Second.
empirically, if the (compensated) labour supply elasticity is
relatively low, then the deadweight loss from the labour tax is
low, and the commensurate welfare gain is reduced. Third.
politically. if carbon tax revenues are used to offset the exist-
ing deficit rather than to reduce taxes on labour and capital.
then the carbon tax acts more like an ordinary tax increase, in-
creasing distortions from taxation to pay for budget items
with a lower return than the extra burden imposed. The gains
to total welfare (reductions in deadweight loss) depend on the
welfare losses associated with these other distortionary taxes.

these approaches “force” technology (i.c., stimulate techno-

meet the standard; on the other hand, gasoline taxes might
have to rise significantly to reduce fuel consumption by the

Energy taxes as a means of controlling greenhouse emissions
must be viewed as “second-best” taxes, in that they do not di-
rectly tax the externality, greenhouse emissions. Whereas car-
bon taxes directly penalize the externality-generating activity,
less targeted alternatives, such as energy taxes. may be politi-
cally more acceptable. Carbon taxes reduce emissions, first
directly, by moving up the demand curve; second indirectly,
by encouraging consumers to switch to less carbon-intensive
energy sources. On the other hand, energy taxes work through
the first path by reducing total energy consumption. But to the
extent that certain kinds of energy, like hydroelectric, have, at
least in the short run, a relatively inelastic supply, there will
be a major impact on oil, gas, and coal; and to the extent that
oil and gas supplies are best described by a model of an ex-
haustible natural resource, with relatively low extraction
costs, most of the supply reduction will occur in coal. Thus,
indirectly, there will be a considerable amount of switching,
through the indirect effects.

"For exhaustible natural resources such as oil. economic ef
ficiency requires that those deposits with the lowest cost of
extraction be extracted first. Hotelling (1931) argued) that
competitive equilibrium implies that rents (price minus costs
of extraction) must rise at the rate of interest. The price of the
backstop technology (an energy source assumed to be avail
able in unlimited quantities at a certain price after a certain
date, such as electricity from solar photovoltaic cells) deter-
mines the set of resources to be ultimately exploited, namely,
all resources for which the cost of extraction is less than the
price implied by the backstop technology’s price. Thus, it is
the tax on oil or gas at the date of swilching to the backstop
technology that determines the ultimate amount of off and gas
that will be extracted, and thus the total burden of CO, placed
on the atmosphere by oil and gas. If that were the only matter
of concern, one could simply announce a commitment to im-
pose such a tax sometime in the future when relevant backstop
technologies become available and competitive. That an-
nouncement would. if believed. have an immediate effect on

Sustainable development, he argues, requires that future gen-

In practice, sustainability as defined by Solow provides
few constraints on growth paths for the developed countries,
so long as steady increases in productivity continue. Technical
change alone, without further capital accumulation, may well
sustain future living standards and offset any effects of envi-
ronmental degradation. To see this with a numerical example,
note that even if estimates of adaptation costs are taken to be
1-3% of GDP should significant warming occur, and if even
moderate rates of technical progress of 1-1.5% per annum
continue to occur, then future generations 45 to 70 years from
now will have twice the income of the current generation.
Even with no discounting, it would be hard on this account
alone to justify the sacrifice of further consumption by this
generation in order to enhance the standard of living of the fu-

about 1980 as a response to the apparent conflict between en-

biodiversity and maintaining environmental quality seemed
incompatible with a five- or tenfold increase in world output,
as would be necessary if per capita incomes of the developing
countries were eventually to approach those enjoyed by the
developed countries now. The sustainable development de-
bate rekindled interest in the question of resource scarcity,
originally addressed in the economics literature by Malthus
(1798) and revived in the policy arena with the publication of
The Limits to Growth (Meadows and Meadows, 1972). Re-
cently, the field of “ecological economics” has extended this
approach (Howarth and Norgaard. 1992).

corporate, or other taxes; granting tax incentives to preferred activi-
ies: or increasing the level of government expenditures. The costs of
the tax will vary widely depending on how the revenues are recycled.
55. Top-down models estimate that for developing countries there
exist low-cost options for reducing emissions in the near term, but
eventually costs would exceed 1% to 2% of GDP (EMF, 1993). For
economies in transition, because of historical inefficiencies and
energy subsidies, there exist large opportunities to reduce emis-
sions at little or no cost. For developing countries, problems of
informal economies make hard estimates difficult, but the cost of sta-
bilizing emissions would likely be large enough to cul into economic
growth,

INE levels and COUNEES IIe Vers OF TNeSe Assets,

First, how should the “stock” of natural resources be defined?
Coal poses perhaps the casiest situation, The location of coal re-
serves is known. Costs of extraction are high, so the rents (the value
of coal in situ) ave low. The depletion can be measured not by the
coal used times the market price, but the coal used times the i sit
value, But for oil and other minerals, information about where re-
serves are located is vital. Two models have been proposed, One sees
the world as having a fixed stock of natural resources (say oil). When
one uses oil, one is depleting this stock. Thus, to calculate the value
of depletion, one does not need to know the entire stock; the flow
(the amount of oil consumed) provides an accurate measure of the
change in stock.

objectives of the policymaker and the nature of the uncertainty about
the marginal cost and marginal benefit curves for carbon emission
reductions (Weitzman, 1974). Theory tells us that if the nature of the
curves is known with very little certainty, but the marginal cost curve
is known to be relatively steeper (i.c., a change in the level of pollu-
tion allowed brings about a greater change in the marginal costs of
mitigation than in the marginal benefits) then taxes should be the
policy of choice. This is because, in this case, an erroneous estima-

84. The literature has identified three types of permit systems. The
ambient permit system (APS) works on the basis of permits defined
according to exposure at the receptor points. Each polluter, then, may
face quite complex markets ~ different permit markets according to

 

different receptor points, and hence different prices. The simpler
emission permit system (EPS) issues permits on the basis of source
emissions and ignores what effects those emissions have on the re-
ceptor points. Within a given region or zone, the polluter would have
only one market to deal with and one price. Finally, there is the pol-
lution offset (PO) system, wherein the permits are defined in terms of
emissions and trade takes place within a defined zone. However, the
standard has to be met at all receptor points. The exchange value of
the permits is then determined by the effects of the pollutants at the
receptor points. The PO system thus combines characteristics of the
EPS and the APS (Pearce and Turner, 1990). These distinctions are
of limited relevance for greenhouse gases. where what is of concern
is global emission levels. The specific location of the emissions is of

no concern.

1.5-2.9% of wond GDP. A 70% reduction in baseline emissions by

Economic dependence on agriculture could be one good
indicator of a nation’s relative exposure to severe climate-
related welfare losses. As a share of domestic product, agri-
culture ranges between 16% and 64% in low-income developing
countries compared to between 12% and 37% in middle-
income developing countries, and 3% in the U.S. (World

trates how climate change is likely to alter the distribution of
global food production, even if there is little impact on the
global total. In their scenarios cereal production in developing
countries could fall by 6-12% by 2050 whereas in industrialized
countries it could rise by 2~14%. The recent African famines il-

Decision analysis is a formal quantitative technique for iden-
tifying “best” choices from a range of alternatives. Decision
analysis requires the development of explicit influence struc-
tures (trees) specifying a complete set of decision choices
(nodes), possible outcomes, and outcome values. Uncertainty
concerning the outcomes of possible choices is incorporated
into decision structures explicitly by assigning probabilities to
individual outcomes.

Figure 2.3 is an example of a simple decision tree for the
comparison of three climate change abatement alternatives. In
Figure 2.3, the choice is represented by a square node and un-
certain outcomes by round nodes, with costs and probabilities
as indicated on the “branches.” For example, Option 2 will
cost $30 to implement. It has an 80% chance of yielding a
zero value outcome and a 20% chance of yielding an outcome
of —$300, and so forth.

"2.9.2.8 Selection criteria and risk attitudes
One of the strengths of decision analysis is that it employs a
uniformly valued set of outcomes, so options can be com-
pared directly. Given a single decision maker and consistent
comparisons, identifying a superior choice is straightforward.
“Consistency” in this case means “behaviour in accordance
with some ordering of alternatives in terms of relative desir-
ability” (Arrow, 1951a; Blaug, 1992). In decision analysis.
consistency of choice is implied by adhering to an explicit se-
lection criterion when identifying preferred alternatives.

"It is generally accepted that these assumptions will not be
perfectly satisfied in actual decision analyses, but often will
be satisfied approximately. If violations of these assumptions
are minor, decision analysis may still yield superior solutions
compared to other decision-making approaches. If any of the
violations is serious, the effectiveness of decision analysis as
a stand-alone decision tool is compromised — decision prob-
lems become intractable due to complexity, ambiguity, or
incompleteness. In these cases, decision analysis loses its
ability to generate a specific result (although it retains much
of its conceptual power).

"There is a single decision maker. Decision analysis does
not make the actual decisions, it only lays out the op-
tions in a consistent manner so that they can be com-

cooperating group of individuals) must choose an op-
tion based on some selection criterion.

 

Decision alternatives are limited. To construct a com-
plete decision tree, the number of choices and their pos-
sible outcomes must be finite (and known).

Valuation of alternatives is consistent. Decision analy-
sis yields expected values for different options. For
these values to be strictly comparable. they must be ex-
pressible in the same units (such as dollars, injuries, AT,

expected values may no longer serve as a reliable indicator of

all) individuals prefer a certain outcome to an uncertain
outcome, even though both outcomes may have the same
expected value. Such an attitude reflects “risk aversion.”
Risk-averse individuals would prefer decision criteria that

prefer different selection criteria. Since any set of decisions
preferred by one party may not be acceptable to another, the
parties will have to negotiate an agreed course of action — one
that is likely to differ from either of the analytically derived
solutions they originally preferred. This negotiation intro-
duces a host of subjective factors (negotiating skill. for exam-

In the case of climate change, there is no single decision

there are two sets of collective decision makers: one at the in-

the Framework Convention on Climate Change (sce Section
2.4), international parties will collectively negotiate climate
decisions. There must also be a set of decision makers within
each country collectively responsible for defining that coun-
try’s positions in the international negotiations. As noted in
Section 2.2, the international parties may be uniquely affected
by numerous climate change-related factors. so they may not
share a consistent set of goals and will probably not cooperate

agencies, individuals, and firms may have conflicting views

The economic theory of choice holds that when an individual
can take a limited range of actions, he or she “has in mind an
ordering of all possible consequences” and chooses “that ac-
tion whose consequences are preferred to those of any other”
(Arrow, 1951a). These individual preferences are often ex-
pressed in terms of multiattribute utility functions, where
“utility” is defined as an “amount of satisfaction” (Keeney
and Raiffa, 1976: Eeckhoudt and Gollier, 1995). The “attrib-
utes” may include economic value, risk, aesthetics, peace of
mind, and other criteria affecting an individual's overall satis-
faction. Choice theory assumes that, in evaluating uncertain
situations, the decision maker uses the monetary value of final
outcomes as a substitute measure of their utility. (Section
2. 1 assumed the opposite conversion — of utility to eco-
nomic value. In either case decision options should have the
same relative values and, given the same selection criterion,
should lead to the same choices.) The valuation of outcomes
in terms of utility enables individuals to rank their prefer-
ences. If individuals are perfectly knowledgeable and consis-

Cost-benefit, which estimates the costs and benefits of

Cost effectiveness, which selects a desired performance

the option achieving this level at lowest cost. Cost-

amounts to expecting the worst (very severe impacts or
very expensive mitigation measures) and avoiding those

Maximin gain, which finds the gains associated with
each action and tries to maximize the minimum of these
gains (Wald, 1950).

Minimax regret, which chooses measures of “regret”

The incorporation of choice theory in decision analysis is
theoretically appealing since a well-defined set of outcome
utilities leads to a straightforward analytic solution — a “best”
choice in terms of expected utility, Unfortunately, expression
of utility as a function in international decision making is
problematic. Arrow’s general impossibility theorem (Arrow,
1951a) suggests that a global social welfare function cannot
exist. Consequently, decisions cannot be based on an analysis
requiring such a function. Even if such utility functions did
exist, some decision outcomes, like energy security and bio-
logical diversity, can be difficult to value in economic terms.
When multiple decision makers are involved, this valuation
problem may become so severe that quantified decision out-
comes lose their meaning.

human ability to process it, decisions may be rational. But
when information content exceeds cognitive limits, decisions
must necessarily be irrational, according to the definition
above. For example, in situations where it is not possible to
specify all options and possible outcomes in advance. one
strategy would be to collect information in a predetermined
manner for a limited time, then select the best alternative
(Dawes, 1988). This is a bounded rational approach, since it
makes the best choice given the limited information. It is nota
strictly rational approach because it imposes an (arbitrary)
time constraint to limit the information available to decision
makers. In this example, it is conceivable that setting a differ-
ent deadline would have resulted in different decisions, even
though the true set of options and outcomes would be un-
changed. Bounded rationality, then, addresses the ways in
which the decision process, rather than the decision input, in-

related to climate change held by different interest groups that
collective agreement could be reached on subjective probabil-

outcome probabilities could initially be assigned, then up-

One way to address these collective cognitive barriers is to
simplify the process of negotiation itself. A number of tools.
like cognitive mapping, simulation modelling, rule-based sys-
tems, and stakeholder analysis, have been developed to diag-
nose and facilitate negotiation (IIASA, 1993). Stakeholder
analysis, for instance, uses information on the position, inter-
est, and priorities of stakeholders to identify the range of dif-
ferences among them and to increase the potential for the
formation of coalitions. As noted in Section 2.3.3, decision
analysis techniques can also be used to support negotiation.
For example, multiattribute utility techniques have been reori-
ented by researchers at ITASA to evaluate coalition building
and preference adjustment in the UN Conference on Environ-
ment and Development. Sjéstedt (1993) has suggested even
more innovative approaches to facilitate negotiation, such as

2.3.3.2 Collective rationality and the negotiation process
The concept of individual rationality discussed in Section
2.3.2.4 can be extended to collective rationality in multiparty
decision scenarios. Economists sometimes accept some form
of “collective preference” as a means of allowing collective
decision makers to reach rational decisions (even if the indi-
vidual decision makers are not strictly rational), Other eco-
nomic models, such as game theory models and principal
agent models, assume that individual agents behave and inter-
act rationally, so the decisions they reach jointly are also ra-
tional, But when individuals are dealing with nonmarket
resources (like clean air), or when cooperation is required,
knowledge requirements in related decision problems exceed
those usually required for rational collective choice. If limita-
tions on knowledge and computational capacity do not apply
equally to all parties in the collective decision process, it
makes the problem even worse, since asymmetric information

For the most part, studies have focussed primarily on nego-
tiation prior to and during the development of an international
accord. But postagreement negotiation is often required to
sustain dialogue on issues that cannot, by their nature, be re-
solved by a single agreement. Postagreement negotiations
present policymakers with somewhat different concerns, such
as progressive reframing of problems, adjusting strategies and
perceptions, and refining solutions. Although it has received
little attention from researchers, postagreement negotiation
can also be improved, for instance, by involving domestic
stakeholders in negotiations from the beginning (and not just
at the postagreement stage), or by modifying the structure of
the accords themselves to create more manageable clusters of
single-issue agreements (Sjéstedt 1993). Regardless of the
stage of negotiation, by improving the decision process these
techniques are intended to help collective decision makers
reach an acceptable agreement (but not necessarily the best
agreement).

situations ... is largely a matter of political judgement.” In an
effort to identify a more objective threshold for de minimis
risks, the authors denote surprise scenarios as those where the

expire. Uncertainty can be an excellent justification for such a
postponement, even though the delay may be costly in the
long run. In the case of climate change, for example, it is as-

2010-2020; if that is so, then appropriate emission levels can

it can improve the overall welfare of the parties exposed to
that risk. The literature indicates that “the transfer of risk is a

Unfortunately, effective mechanisms for the appropriate
redistribution of these international economic burdens are not
currently available. Economic theory demonstrates that,
where damages are borne collectively, individual responsibil-
ity for action leads to suboptimal outcomes. There is a strong
incentive for each party to rely on the others to act — in other
words, to be a free rider. A conventional approach to reducing
the cost of risk is insurance, where relatively small premiums
paid by all parties are able to compensate those who suffer
losses. But there is no global market for national insurance
against environmental losses. Even if the institutions were
available to distribute such risk, expecting agreement on the
appropriate sharing formula would be unrealistic.

with international transfers (due to the imposition of pay-

agreement to address climate change will be difficult. Com-

less, there is a clear need to consider fair and feasible transfers
in any comprehensive decision process in order to attract
widespread participation and insure international support.
Sharing the costs of actions in a sequential path of acting and
learning should lead to collective support for the globally op-

Insurance as a means of sharing risks is well suited to situ-
ations where the likelihood of a damaging event for any indi-
vidual party is relatively small but the potential damages are
large. Since the relationship between weather-related events
and climate change is not known. insurance to cover the risks
of climate change, per se, is probably not feasible or neces-
sary. However, insurance to cover the damages associated
with weather-related events is desirable. To the extent that the
frequency or severity of weather events turns out to be af-
fected by climate change, such insurance would be a form of
climate change insurance. But since a meaningful premium
for private insurance against climate change losses cannot be
calculated. insurers have responded to weather disasters by
withdrawing or restricting coverage in regions that are partic-
ularly prone to such events. If climate change does contribute
to those events, the affected regions bear the costs of actions

against climate impacts could enhance welfare. However,
Wilford (1993), Chichilnisky and Heal (1993), and others

cannot adequately cover risks associated with climate change.
First, there is no international market in which individuals or
countries can insure themselves against losses from climate
change or related abatement policies. Even if such a market
existed, insurance on a country-by-country basis would miss
many potential benefits from collectively sharing risks. To the
limited extent that insurance could cover climate risks, the in-
surance premiums would probably be borne inequitably by
the parties exposed to those risks. Establishing an appropriate
form of global insurance could thus increase both efficiency
and equity by reducing exposure to risk and the cost to indi-
vidual countries of bearing that risk.

ince Would permit a more efficient distribu-
tion of those risks. For example. a country genuinely believ-

impacts would be more prone to hold those securities that pay
out under these conditions (Heal, 1993). A formal two-
country treatment is summarized in Chichilnisky and Heal
(1993) and Chichilnisky (1994). These studies also note that
creating risk securities may provide an objective test of the
honesty of national positions on the risks of climate change.
If, as part of a negotiating ploy to avoid onerous abatement
commitments, a country were to argue that climate change
does not involve substantial risks. that country would have to
be prepared to hold associated high payoff securities. Hence.
there would be an economic penalty for misrepresentation of
true belicfs. These penalties could offset some of the incentive

finds some measures to reduce greenhouse gas emis-

« Peck and Teisberg (1993) and Manne and Richels
(1993) have estimated the value of spending on climate
research, They use highly stylized models for the analy-
sis, but find that the expected return is several times the
current level of climate research spending. Peck (1994)
has also shown that current spending in the U.S. is not
allocated in an optimal manner.

« Results from Energy Modeling Forum 12 (Energy Mod-
eling Forum, 1993) suggest that reducing the costs of
future nonfossil energy technologies could reduce the
costs of achieving emission reduction targets by as
much as two-thirds. This suggests a potentially large
economic return from technology research. Funding for
technology research related to climate change should be
considered as a risk premium, not as subsidies to be ran-
domly allocated.

« Several researchers have compared the costs of unilat-
eral action and international cooperation to address cli-
mate change. The analyses consistently show large
economic returns from international cooperation. Such
cooperation, however. requires mechanisms for trans-
ferring resources among countries. Otherwise, countries
with high marginal costs of emission reduction might
find it advantageous to be free riders until a complete
international climate agreement is concluded (Pillet er
al, 1993),

« Analyses of phasing out existing inefficient emission
policies suggest that emissions can be reduced with net
economic benefits. Larsen and Shah (1992) estimate
that global CO, emissions would be reduced by between
4 and 5% if all energy subsidies were removed. An
OECD study estimates that removal of energy subsidies
would reduce global emissions 18% from projected lev-
els in 2050 while increasing global real incomes by
0.7% annually (Burniaux ef al., 1992).

Equity concerns both “proces
terms of the distribution of costs and benefits internationally.
Indices such as Gross World Product aggregate wealth inde-
pendently of distribution. However. assessing aggregate wel-
fare (utility) requires valuing and aggregating differential
impacts among countries. This is an issue of ethics and poli-

considerations is only possible if effective institutions exist
for appropriate (compensating) international redistribution.

particularly with respect to transboundary impacts of some
actors upon others. There are few. if any, ethical systems in

"Equity and social considerations are central to discussions of
steps to be taken to implement the Framework Convention on
Climate Change, both intrinsically and because widespread
participation is essential if the objectives of the Convention
are to be gained. Countries are unlikely to participate fully un-
less they perceive the arrangements to be equitable. This ap-
plies particularly to equity among regions and countries, but
equity within countries, and associated social considerations,
are also important influences on what is possible and desir-
able. Mitigating and adapting to climate change will require
actions on the part of individuals. Governments will find it
easier to comply with international obligations if their citizens
feel that the obligations and benefits of compliance are dis-
tributed equitably. And richer countries are unlikely to burden
their poorer citizens to benefit relatively rich citizens in poor
countries.

"Issues relating to equity among regions and countries stem
from the substantial differences that exist among countries.
Countries differ not only in terms of size. resources, popula-
tion, and wealth, but also in terms of emissions of greenhouse
gases, vulnerability to climate change, and institutional capa-
bilities to respond effectively to climate change. In general,
the implications of climate change for developing countries
differ from those for developed countries because the former
are generally poorer, emit much less per capita, have con-
tributed less to past emissions, and have shorter policy time
horizons. Moreover, their institutions are often weaker, they
face other urgent priorities, and they are generally more vul-
nerable to climate change. But there are substantial variations
within both the developed and the developing countries, and a
tigid delineation of equity issues along developed and devel-
oping country lines is inappropriate and may be highly dam-
aging in the long run.

By contrast, institutions at the international level are rela-
tively weak. In responding to climate change, the interna-
tional community faces unavoidable decisions about the
distribution of effort and burdens and what constitutes accept-
able behaviour in circumstances where the internal behaviour
of one state may directly affect all others. Although, on a
modest scale, there are precedents, climate change is unique
in the scale and scope of its potential implications and the co-
ordinated international responses it requires. Yet international
institutions dedicated to coordinating such responses are rela-

No international agreement has ever been founded purely
on a logical consideration of equity issues. A host of other fac-
tors, ranging from basic economic and political power struc-
tures to accidents of timing and personalities, influences the
outcome. But the converse ~ the cynical view that equity con-
siderations play no role at all in the real world of international
politics — is not true either. Many authors have argued that the
long-term, cross-cutting strategic and global nature of the
climate problem makes equity issues central to any solution.
Indeed, a broad view of self-interest can also often point
towards explicit consideration of equitable outcomes because
of the longer-term risks that grossly inequitable behaviour
may pose to stability and cooperation in the international sys-
tem.

Although science cannot prescribe or decide what actions
would be equitable under the Climate Convention, science,
religion, and philosophy can illuminate the meaning of equity
and clarify the choices that the parties to the Convention face.
This is the task of this chapter. It considers concepts of equity
and issues that must be addressed in efforts to apply these
concepts. It then views these broad concepts within the tra-
dition of international law and the specific context of the
Framework Convention, and considers the several ways in
which this text assigns specific meaning to equity. It next ana-
lyzes in detail several specific aspects of equity: international
equity in coping with the impacts of climate change and asso-
ciated risks, international equity in efforts to limit climate
change, equity and social considerations within countries, and
equity in international processes. Equity among generations
(or intergenerational equity) is the subject of the next chapter.

The second relates to process, most notably the principle of
equal treatment before the law: Similar cases must be dealt
with in a similar manner. and exceptions must be made on a
principled basis. In this sense, the principle of equity not only
requires that law should govern decisions but also provides
guidance in how laws should be applied. However. all the
circumstances in which a law would be applied cannot be
foreseen at the time of its formulation. Thus, starting with
Aristowle, theorists have argued that laws be applied in an
equitable manner to achieve what the legislators would have
intended in the specific circumstances of a particular case
(Shapiro, 1990). The concept of equity also embodies a higher
notion of justice that goes beyond the rules. no matter how
fairly they were devised. The Anglo-American common law
tradition, for example, often introduces equity into judicial
decisions to correct a potential injustice by too rigid an appli-
cation of the law.

"This analysis focusses on equity issues relating to climate
change responses that might be considered by the interna-
tional community. Equity issues exist at both the national and
international levels, but there is an important difference be-
tween these contexts. Within countries institutions exist to ad-
dress a wide range of issues of common interest to members
of that society. The institutions have developed in part to pro-
vide a way of taking decisions about what constitutes accept-
able behaviour and about the distribution of wealth and re-
sources, which in most countries are redistributed through
regulation of market structures, backed by legal codes, and by
taxation with the intent of promoting social good. Equity — in
the form of views about what constitutes justice — has an im-
portant influence on these institutions and their decisions and
is a measure of their legitimacy. The actual strength and per-
ceived legitimacy of these institutions vary widely. but they
nevertheless provide an existing framework within which
policies to address climate change at the national level can be

developed and implemented.

Proportionality is a principle that dates back at least to
Aristotle: it asserts that burdens or benefits should be distrib-
uted in proportion to the contributions of claimants.

Rawlsian distributive justice (Rawls, 1971) carried the
concept of utilitarianism a step further, arguing for an equal
distribution unless an unequal distribution operates to the
benefit of the least advantaged.

"Consequentialist equity has to do with the outcome of deci-

the meaning of equity in this sense (Young, 1994), They may

Priority argues that those with the greatest need should be
advantaged, This forms the basis of the “basic needs” ap-
proach, which puts the emphasis on the absolute right of indi-

at some minimum standard of well-being. This would include
potable water, minimum nutrition, and health care and general
environmental resources.

In practice, when societies try to achieve equity, they do so
in nuanced and subtle ways, applying several criteria and
seeking to achieve a balance among them. The balance is also
affected by self-interest: In the real world, people tend to seek
and to emphasize principles that may advantage them. Never-
theless, the principles are useful guides to what might consti-
tute equitable decisions.

"instance, John Rawls (1971) has argued that all individuals
have equal rights to as extensive a system of political liberties
as is possible without diminishing the liberties of others. A
similar but stronger view has been put forward by Robert
Nozick (1974), who has argued that all individuals have a
sphere of moral rights in which no one. including the state, is
allowed to interfere, irrespective of the consequences that
might arise.

"These consequentialist principles were developed in
the context of specific societies, not internationally. The liter-

more recent and is largely derived by extension of the above
principles (Beitz, 1979; for a review in the context of cli-

No society has ever had complete consensus on any one of
these approaches alone as an adequate criterion for defining
consequentialist equity. Some (such as basic needs) are in-
complete, prohibiting certain outcomes but not helping
choices between other options. Single principles may also not
be appropriate or practical as the only standard because,
among other reasons, cases and individuals are rarely identi-
cal and burdens and benefits may not be divisible; or, if they
are, they may not be divisible into shares that are susceptible
to precise, cardinal measurement, thus making it impossible
to apply the principles directly.

Nevertheless, by extrapolation and analogy, these theories
offer insights about the application of procedural equity
between states. For example. the notion that procedural
equity demands that basic rights (of individuals or states),
however they are defined, must be respected in decision mak-
ing is commonly accepted in domestic and international law.
Article 2, paragraph 7. of the UN Charter, for instance, states
that nothing contained in the Charter shall authorize the
United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially
within the domestic jurisdiction of any state, but that the prin-
ciple should not prejudice the application of enforcement
measures. Other elements of procedural equity between states
are discussed in more detail in Section 3.2, on international
law.
"	Text
" 

It is important to recognize that these particular theories
were originally developed for dealing with questions of jus-
tice within a state. Rawls, for instance, draws a sharp distinc-
tion between the principles of justice that prevail among
persons within a society and “justice between states” to which
his theory was not intended to apply (Stone, 1993). Conse-
quently, the application of these theories to the subject of
international justice — justice between states — presents
problems (Van Dyke. 1975: Stone, 1993), Not least is the fact
that as holders of the rights of sovereignty, it is nation-states,
rather than individual human beings, that negotiate the nature
of international commitments. This is so despite the fact that
there is a huge amount of cross-border interaction between in-
dividuals, corporations, and international nongovernmental
groups, and such nonstate actors can play important roles.

Both procedural and consequentialist equity issues are
complicated by a wide variety of cultural and societal as-
sumptions about ethics, the environment, and development.
The existence of these different and sometimes conflicting
principles, and the need for compromise between them. is
considered by Rayner (1993, 1994), who argues that a number
of fundamentally different “world views” are adopted towards
climate change. These views not only span different ideas of
equity but also differ concerning basic assumptions about the
urgency of abatement action and appropriate management
strategies. and can be correlated with different institutional
types identified by cultural theory.! The process of developing
a response is seen as a process of compromise between these
different world views, each of which tries to influence polics

There is no inherent conflict between economics and most
conceptions of equity. But a conflict can arise because of
differing ideas or assumptions, sometimes hidden, about
how individual utilities should be defined, compared, and
aggregated. It is important to understand that economics itself
cannot resolve these differences. Explicit discussions of eq-
uity are essential because they reflect differing ideas about
how - and indeed whether — individual utilities should be
measured and aggregated.

The central idea behind sustainable development is that the

possibilities for future generations to achieve comparable

asserting that utilities can and should not be estimated and
aggregated at all across countries, that countries bear no
responsibility for the welfare of others. International negotia-

Arrow (1951) addressed the fundamental question of
whether individual preferences can be aggregated in a reason-
able way into overall societal preferences. He concluded that,
in general, it is impossible to add individual preferences to-
gether to produce a social welfare function if we require the
resulting aggregation to satisfy some very natural and reason-
able conditions, such as preventing individuals trom holding
dictatorial powers, Thus, it is generally not possible to deduce
“objectively” a socially preferred distribution of well-being
from individual preferences. However, if it is known that
these preferences are restricted to certain types, then it may
still be possible to combine them in a consistent and reason-
able way to form a social ordering (see Sen, 1984).

It is in th ue of whether and how to aggregate separate
utilities that an apparent conflict between equity and eco-
nomic efficiency can arise. Whether it does or not depends on
how efficiency is defined. “Pareto efficiency,” for example,
describes situations in which no one can be made better off
without making anyone else worse off. Pareto efficiency is
thus generally neutral with respect to equity because it allows
a wide variety of possible distributions. More often, however,
the term “economic efficiency” describes the maximization of
“something” with the resources available. Maximizing GNP -
or perhaps “World Product” (WP) — could involve highly in-
equitable outcomes, which might well imply lower global
welfare, depending on how welfure is defined in relation to
the distribution of wealth. With appropriate international
transfers, however, it could also allow a much fairer and ethi-
cally benign world with a real gain in global welfare.

example, that activities in the Area “shall be carried out for

that the Court has not yet had to deal with interpreting obliga-

"By differentiating obligations and by including the forego-
ing factors, the Framework Convention on Climate Change
appears to have dealt comprehensively with the equity con-
cerns. On a practical level, however, the implementation of
the Convention on an equitable basis will require further
agreement between purties about the significance of these fac-
tors, the relative weight to be given to each in particular situa-
tions, and the precise meaning of commitments undertaken by
each of them. This, in turn, will require agreement about the
meaning of principles, such as the principle of common but
differentiated responsibilities, the right to sustainable devel-
opment, and concepts such as “common concern of hu-
mankind,” which is a new concept in international law.
Reaching agreement about these matters will have a critical
bearing on how the benefits and burdens of combatting cli-
mate change are allocated between states.

"Wealth is one of the most obvious and pervasive differences
between countries. Much of the literature on international eq-
uity starts from this issue, and the statistics need little elabora-
tion. In terms of annual average income, measured by gross
national product (GNP) at market exchange rates, more than
half of the world’s population (58.7%) live in the forty-two
countries that are classified as “low-income” in the World
Bank’s World Development Report 1994 (World Bank, 1994).
These countries have an average per capita gross national
product (GNP) of $390. The 15.2% of the world’s population
that live in the twenty-three countries that the World Develop-
ment Report classifies as “high-income economies” have an
average per capita GNP of $22,160, almost sixty times that
of the low-income economies. The remaining sixty-seven
“middle-income economies” have an average per capita GNP
of $2.490, just slightly more than one-tenth that of the “high-
income” countries.

During the negotiation of the FCCC, many of these consid-

tion should adopt a “comprehensive” approach, and. if so.
whether it should focus on “gross” greenhouse gas emissions
or “net” emissions derived by subtracting the removal of
greenhouse gases by sinks from total emissions by sources
(Bodansky, 1993), Adoption of the comprehensive approach
means that all sources and sinks of different greenhouse guses
have to be considered in formulating policy. Accordingly.
global warming potentials are calculated for each gas to per-

Some of these issues were addressed by the Special Report
on Developing Countries of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC, 1990), which stated that “the priority
for the alleviation of poverty continues to be an overriding
concern of the developing countries; they would rather con-
serve their financial and technical resources for tackling their
immediate economic problems than make investments to
avert a global problem which may manifest itself after two
generations.” Article 4.7 of the Framework Convention on
Climate Change also recognizes that “economic and social
development and poverty eradication are the first and overrid-

influence implementation of their commitments.

"Poverty also has an important bearing on national priorities
and the time scales considered in policy. Economists have
long noted that personal discount rates decline with rising in-
come. Richer people can afford to look further ahead. have
greater security, and can afford to invest more for the future
(though, in fact, the pattern of investment as a fraction of
wealth is very variable). Poor people tend to be focussed more
on short-term concerns, including striving to ensure they can
meet basic needs. This has important implications for the po-
tential equity impact of policies to address climate change
within countries. as noted earlier in this chapter, and the same
applies at the level of national economic and political sys-

"Obviously there are great variations within countries, but
in sum the same broad issues apply concerning wealth dispar-
ities between countries. The aggregate relationship between
wealth, consumption of a variety of natural resources, and
emissions of various pollutants has been explored methodi-
cally by a number of authors. Using cross-sectional data,
Parikh et al. (1992) shows that consumption of a wide variety
of resources — many of which involve emissions of green-
house gases in their extraction, processing, and application —
is closely related to the level of wealth. Williams et al. (1987),
Drucker (1986), and others have argued that, in many devel-
oped economies, a decoupling of wealth from the volume of
material consumption has occurred since the 1970s and that
this tendency will accelerate. Others have disputed this inter-
pretation, however (Herman er a/., 1987). Nevertheless, the
aggregate relationship at middle and lower income levels
scems undisputed, The World Development Report 1992
(World Bank, 1992) notes that emissions of some pollutants
decline beyond a certain stage of economic development.
However, the report does not claim that such a point has yet
been reached in the case of CO,.

Because of all the difficulties associated with estimating, comparing, and projecting greenhouse gas removal over time,

equity — the latter argument being that the estimates require a
baseline date against which to measure carbon accumulation

In 1990 the World Resources Institute (WRI, 1990) published an extensive set of data on national greenhouse gas emissions
from which they concluded that responsibility for climate change was shared widely between countries in the industrialized
and developing world. Their methodology and conclusions were vigorously attacked by Agarwal und Narain (1991), who
claimed that the analysis was inherently biased against poor countries. They presented an alternative approach, concluding
that developing countries bore no responsibility for the problem but were, in fact, contributing to cleaning up emissions
from the industrialized world. The dispute attracted widespread academic, public, and political attention.

There were important disagreements over the accuracy of data and the range of gases included (Ahuja, 1992; Thery,

"countries were in fact helping to clean up the excessive emissions trom Industrialized countries.

A difficulty with Agarwal and Narain’s approach is that the rate at which greenhouse gases are removed from the atmos-
phere depends on the concentration gradient and therefore the level of gross emissions: The more that is emitted, the more is
removed. Thus, it does not follow from Agarwal and Narain’s approach that concentrations would decline if all countries did
emit at the per capita rate of the poorer countries. After a few years it is likely that concentrations would still rise, but at a
much slower rate. It is a complex process, however, and it is widely believed that the proportion absorbed declines with ris-
ing global emissions and could fall sharply if human emissions started to saturate natural sink processes. The real relation-
ship between “gross” and “net” emissions, and how the latter should be assigned, is thus very complex.

assigned this to each country in proportion to estimated emissions in that year (or an average of recent years).

Agarwal and Narain raised two central objections to this measure. First, it took no account of the distribution of historical
emissions, which are in fact largely responsible for current concentration levels. Second, by distributing the net concentra-
tion in proportion to gross emissions, the natural reabsorption — the “sink capacity” — was implicitly being allocated in pro-
portion to emissions, This. they contended, was a grossly inequitable approach, because the sink capacity was a natural,
global common resource that should be allocated equally to all people. By dividing the total annual absorption of each
greenhouse gas (the difference between gross emissions and measured atmospheric increase) in proportion to national pop-
ulation, they showed that most developing countries’ shares of the global reabsorption of greenhouse gases on this basis ex-
ceeded their actual gross emissions. Far from bearing any responsibility for the problem. they concluded, developing

countries were in fact helping to clean up the excessive emissions from industrialized countries.

These estimates can be subjected to the criticisms that
Agarwal and Narain (1991) raised in connection with an in-
dex of current net emissions (see Box 3.1). By “discounting”
emissions to reflect the removal of gases, there is an implicit
assignment of the earth’s past sink capacity in proportion to
emissions. Fujii (1990) and Meyer (1995) furnish calculations
to show that if the total CO, absorption were assigned on an
equal historic per capita basis, most developing countries are
in fact “in credit” -— their cumulative emissions are smaller
than the global average per capita absorption, and so on this
basis their past contribution is not merely small but actually
negative.

Cumulative past emissions account for the buildup of gases in
the atmosphere. Smith (1993) provides the most thorough ac-
count of how indices of past emissions can relate to current
concentrations and gives data for cumulative carbon emis-
sions in the period 1950-86, From these he has derived esti-
mates of the “natural debt"" that each country has drawn from
(over)use of the atmospheric capacity: he justifies the 1950
cutoff on both ethical and practical grounds. The most exten-
sive databases for cumulative emissions of CO, and methane
are those developed by the International Institute of Applied
Systems Analysis (IIASA). These include estimates of indus-
trial and biotic carbon emissions back to 1800, as well as esti-
mates of methane emissions, presented to a useful but
manageable degree of regional breakdown. Their results are

Because of the somewhat more rapid growth of developing
country emissions in the last two to three decades, responsi-
bility for the problem is much more sensitive to the index
chosen for current emissions than it is for cumulative contribu-
tions. The most important issue is whether one focusses on
total or per capita emission rates. Developing countries tend
to focus on the latter, as an index that highlights the extent of
disparities between industrialized and developing societies in
emissions associated with individual lifestyles, and conse-
quently as a way of emphasizing their argument that pro-
fligate and unsustainable lifestyles in the industrialized
countries are the root of the problem, Commentators from in-
dustrialized countries more often point out that, in terms of
climate change, it is total emissions that matter, and that ser
capita indices ignore the important element of gross popula:
tion itself as a causal factor.

Considering the population axis gives a counterpoint to this
picture. Many of the blocks that are much lower in Figure 3.1
(low per capita emissions) are also much wider (high popula-
tion). The developing economies of Asia alone account for more
than half the global population. Despite their lower per capita
levels, this makes them significant contributors to the total (the
area of the individual blocks shown in Figure 3.1). Altogether in
1993 the OECD countries accounted for about 50.5% of global
fossil carbon emissions, with about half of this being from the
U.S. The former USSR and Eastern European countries ac-
counted for 17% (with half of this being from Russia). and the
developing countries contributed just under a third of gross
fossil carbon emissions (with over 40% of this from China).

From an equity perspective it is important to distinguish
“business as usual” projections from assumptions about the
location of abatement, and to have a sufficient regional break-
down to relate emission patterns to economic and other re-
gional differences. The scenarios of the 1990 IPCC Scientific
Assessment (unlike the 1992 update) had sufficient clarity on
both counts, but were criticized for embodying highly in-
equitable assumptions. both in the reference scenario and in
the apportioning of emission reductions in abatement scenar-
ios. Parikh (1992) noted that the reference scenario “permit-
ted” a substantial increase in North American emissions but
considered that “cuts for the South are already built into the
reference models.” compared with the rates of growth that
might otherwise be expected. “The stabilization scenarios,”
she argued, “stabilize the lifestyles of the rich and adversely

affect the development of the poor.”

Data for sources other than fossil CO, (see, for example,
SEI, 1992) are, us noted, much more uncertain, but in general
the disparities between industrialized and developing coun-
tries are greater for CFCs, and less for all other sources, than
those noted here for fossil Co, Most notably, almost all emis-
sions from deforestation — thought to be in the range of 15-
25% of total CO, releases in the early 1990s ~ are from a
relatively small group of developing countries; anthropogenic
methane emissions are probably predominantly from China
(fossil and agricultural methane) and South and East Asia
(agricultural methane), However, emissions of this gas are
fairly broadly distributed, with most continents each con-
tributing about 10% of the anthropogenic total (SEI, 1992;
Subak, 1993). How the warming contribution of these emis-
sions compares with fossil CO, data depend on the data and

For several reasons, however, neither index can be taken
as giving an authoritative comparison of energy efficiency.
PPP estimates themselves are not only approximate (they
can vary considerably between sources) but are not always
more appropriate for comparing energy intensities. That is
because fossil carbon emissions arise largely from industrial
production, often involving goods traded at market ex-
change rates, whereas PPP is driven by consumption com-
parisons.

It is well known, however, that exchange rates tend to un-
dervalue the real purchasing power of currencies in poor
economies, particularly where there are strong exchange
controls; it is, for example, possible to live quite well in
some poor countries on the exchange rate equivalent of a
few U.S. dollars a day. Estimates of purchasing power parity
(PPP) attempt to compare currencies in a way that equili-
brates purchasing power. For OECD countries the difference
in GNP calculated at PPP and market exchange rates is mod-
est, usually 10-30%: for some developing countries the dif-
ference in GNP is extremely large.

Most developing countries are in tropical regions, and
projected climatic changes seem unlikely to improve ei-
ther the quality of the physical environment or agricul-
tural productivity: indeed, modelling studies indicate
that climate change will reduce relative agricultural out-
put in the developing world (Chapters 2, 6; see also Vol-
ume 2).

Developing economies are much more dependent on
agriculture and other aspects of natural resource flows.
Institutional and social structures within developing
countries tend to be weaker and hence less able to cope
with change. Developing countries also have fewer fi-
nancial resources for investing in more robust infra-
structure. Meyer-Abich (1994) concludes that this on
its own is sufficient reason “to prevent greenhouse gas-
induced climate change. because if it happens, present
inequalities would be irresponsibly increased.”

In addition, some regions may be exceptionally vulnerable to
climate change. Small island states and countries with low-
lying coastal areas are obviously vulnerable, not only because
of their greater susceptibility to sea level rise but also their
heavy dependence on natural resources for domestic use and
for trade that may be affected by climate change (Saha, 1994).
In addition to these adverse economic impacts, all or part of
these countries may be destroyed or rendered uninhabitable
by sea level rise (which is projected to continue well beyond
the end of the next century. even if action is taken to curb
emissions) and attendant salt water intrusion. Storm surges
and other changes (such as subsidence) may exacerbate these
impacts. The potentially devastating impact of tropical storms
on low-lying regions was graphically iHustrated by the 1991
Bangladesh cyclone, which claimed more than 200,000 lives
(del Mundo, 1992) and perhaps twice that number. Such im-
pacts clearly could have profound consequences for both hu-
man communities and entire ecosystems (see, for example,
Broadhus, 1993).

"Whichever variant of future scenarios is considered — and
especially for the higher growth cases favoured by many in
the developing world — the vast majority contain a clear mes-
sage. The ambiguities about whether the developing world
holds significant responsibility for contributing to climate
change will not persist for long. Even in relatively restrained
scenarios of emission growth from the developing world, such
as the original WEC reference case, fossil CO, emissions
alone from these countries will equal those of the OECD
by 2020. And in many scenarios, fossil CO, emissions from
the current developing nations will exceed today’s total
global emissions before the year 2050, despite still being
considerably lower in per capita terms. Furthermore, in terms
of the distribution of abatement efforts, there are signifi-
cant spillover effects both positive and negative.6 Edmonds

The common thread in all the scenarios of extreme vulner-

a cost, But these conditions do not exist in some of the most
vulnerable regions and are not easy to import. Furthermore,

The possibility of extreme physical impacts and complex so-
cial reactions poses dilemmas for evaluating aggregate im-
pacts. As discussed in the introduction to this chapter, there is
no single right way to do this. It can only be done by making
ethical judgments about what to measure, and how to measure
and compare the welfare of different people in different coun-
tries across time. Considering only impacts on World Product
is a poor enough indicator because (as outlined in Chapter |
and discussed in Chapter 7) World Product makes no pretence
to be a real measure of welfare. But if it is predominant
poorer people who are affected, it is even worse as an indica-
tor, because poor people add very little to aggregate wealth.

Attempts to allow for “nonmarket” impacts, such as those
on human health, social stability, and environmental quality.
require assumptions to be made about how to value and aggre-
gate such impacts on different people in different countries.
Economics seeks classically to establish a monetary equiva-
lent for these impacts (e.g., Fankhauser, 1993), as discussed
further in Chapters 5 and 6. Scaling impact costs according to
relative GNP implies valuation of human impacts based on
average earning power. In welfare economics this approach is
contentious, as it is widely acknowledged to relate poorly
even to the more established “willingness to pay” criterior.
and that itself is acknowledged to have major limitations. Par-
ticularly for poorer people, “willingness to pay” to avoid en-
vironmental damage may give a very different (and muca
lower) valuation than “willingness to accept” compensition
for such damage.

at present, and on the basis of a survey of projected impacts in
vulnerable regions, estimates that this figure could rise to 150
million by the middle of the next century as a result of climate
change. He sketches the immense social, economic, and polit-
ical costs implicit in such movements, “pushing the overall
cost far beyond what we can realistically envisage in the light
of our experience to date... it requires a leap of imagination
to envisage 150 million destitutes abandoning their home-

"These extreme vulnerabilities raise important equity is-

extent those contributing very little to its causes. For small is-

tion to climate change may be a more important, and more
urgent, task than planning and undertaking national mitiga-

communities will have to place more emphasis on adaptation.
However, the acceptance that the developed country parties
must assist particularly vulnerable developing country parties
in meeting the costs of adaptation indicates agreement that it
would be inequitable for members of the international com-

the costs of that vulnerability alone. Possible implications of
this exceptional vulnerability for international responses that
aimed at coping with climate change and minimizing its im-

wealth, their position will not feature. If it is judged by how
well it protects the weakest, and minimizes the most severe
suffering, an entirely different approach may be called for

the ethical debates surrounding utilitarianism and the Rawl-

This issue in itself could have important implications for
the balance between mitigation and adaptation. Although sig-
nificant populations may be involved, particularly if migra-
tory pressures spread the human impacts, their wealth and
hence “willingness to pay” (constrained by their ability to
pay) are negligible on a global scale. On most utilitarian for-
mulations, their potential suffering thus registers little. By the
same token, they have scarcely contributed to the problem
that threatens them. Some commentators dispute the appropri-
ateness of even attempting economic valuation of such ex-
treme impacts, particularly when they are inflicted by the
actions of others. Evaluation in terms of “willingness to ac-
cept” compensation for such damages can preserve the ethical
basis of monetary evaluation of impacts, but impact ;
ments have not yet been developed on this basis. Also, a claim
for infinite compensation would return the issue to one of the
ethics of imposing damages that the victim claims are not
compensable by money. Adams (1995) argues that seeking to
monetize impacts in these circumstances risks entrenching
disputes rather than resolving them, and should be abandoned
in favour of negotiations that scek to forge greater consensus
about the appropriate values to employ.

This difficulty points to the need to develop general rules
of international law regarding liability and compensation.
However, in the absence of new rules of liability, the tradi-
tional “fault-based” rules of responsibility of international
law could provide a basis for vulnerable. generally poorer,
states adversely affected by climate change to receive com-
pensation from richer states whose past and present emissions
of greenhouse gases have caused environmental harm. The is-
sue of historical emissions could be of direct relevance here,
as climate impacts are a function of atmospheric concentra-
tions, which depend strongly on cumulative emissions. Al-
though the Convention’s preamble recognizes that the largest
share of historical and current global emissions of greenhouse
gases originated in developed countries, and that per capita
emissions in developing countries are relatively low and will
need to grow to meet their social and development needs, its
legal ramifications remain unclear.
"	Text
"The second factor, which applies irrespective of this in-
equitable distribution of impacts (but is much reinforced by
it), is the direct causal link: the fact that the actions of some
people (emitting greenhouse gases) may directly harm others.
There are few, if any, ethical systems in which it is acceptable
for one individual knowingly to inflict potentially serious
harm on another and not accept any responsibility in helping
or compensating the victim or to pay in some other way. An
analogous principle in international law provides that a state
may exploit its resources but has the responsibility to ensure
that activities in its jurisdiction do not cause harm to the envi-
ronment of other states or to areas beyond its national juris-
diction. This principle is generally accepted as a rule of
customary international law. Its application to the climate
change context is problematic. however, as it is extremely dif-
ficult for one state to prove before an international court or tri-
bunal a direct causal link between another state’s emissions
and its own environmental damage. Although, upon signing
the Framework Convention on Climate Change, a number of
small island countries indicated that they may rely on tradi-
tional rules of international law to address damage to their en-
vironment from climate change, it is widely recognized that it
would be factually and legally difficult to use these rules suc-

fore have a higher cost of risk bearing. Second, the cost of risk
bearing may be much higher in some developing countries
than in industrialized countries because of the nature of the
impacts, For example, when considering sea level rise, a range
from 20 cm to 60 cm may imply a quite low cost of risk bear-
ing ina country like the U.S., and the expected damage would
be a good proxy for the total cost of sea level rise. For a coun-
try like Bangladesh, however, the difference between 20 cm
and 60 em may mean a substantial difference in utility, which
is not accounted for in the expected damage. Thus the cost of

bearing also of great importance. Analysis is technically diffi-

ple, the combination of the idea of basic needs and risk
bearing could have far-reaching implications. I we accept
that individuals have the right to some basic goods — food,
shelter, access to environmental resources — and if emitting
greenhouse gases threatens the availability of these basic
goods, then those responsible for the emissions should be pre-

the costs of reducing energy-related emissions from a given

should be more willing to abate. This basically accords with
Kant’s categorical imperative. which states that one should
act as if the maxim of one’s act were to become a universal
law of nature. Barrett (1992) analyzes an idealized application
of this Kantian rule for abatement.

More widely suggested is some proportion of GNP: Wirth
and Lashof (1990) and Cline (1992), for example, suggest that
this could be a component of an allocation on the grounds that
carbon emissions are partially tied to economic activity. One
difficulty is that the relationship is quite variable between
countries for a variety of reasons, and pure GNP allocation
faces the objection that on its own it would directly reward the
richer countries, thus exacerbating inequalities (especially
since poorer countries generally have lower GNP/carbon ra-
tios). There could also be technical difficulties associated
with definitions and manipulation of GNP comparisons

Various ad hoc allocation schemes have been proposed.
Krause er al, (1990) suggest that an overall cumulative limit
for emissions of 300 GtC over the period 1985-2100 be estab-
lished and divided equally among the current industrialized
and developing countries. The general characteristics of this
allocation are argued to be ethically appealing — it requires
substantial cutbacks from the industrialized world and allows
for some interim growth for developing countries — but no
more detailed division is offered and no more formal justifica-
tions for a 50:50 aggregated division of future emi
presented.’ Westing (1989) suggests land area as a basis for
allocation, but without any particular justification and with
some perverse consequences (Grubb eral, 1992),

"There are three reasons for dividing the issues in this way.
First, it provides a useful way of classifying the literature.
Second, it provides an analytically clear delineation that may
help to remove some of the confusion in understanding the lit-
erature. Much of the economics literature assumes that an in-
ternational market — mediated by large international transfers
to produce a global least-cost response — exists or will natu-
rally come into being. This debatable assumption explains
much of the division between economic and other perspec-
tives. Third, by the same token, if provides a politically useful
charification. Many are skeptical of the prospect that an inter-
national fund, with payments through it on some equitable ba-
sis in support of a globally optimal response, will in reality
ever be created, and this explains much of the fear about in-
equitable global responses. Focussing initially on allocation
in the absence of separated big international transfers helps to
clarify these issues.

The major objections are . raised partly on ethical and prac-
tical “comparable-burden” arguments (since this approach
would imply a huge adjustment burden on developed coun-
tries, to which they are unlikely to agree) and partly on
grounds of concerns that such allocation might “reward” pop-
ulation and population growth. Proponents tend to argue that
any such effect would be negligible compared to other factors
influencing population; but to avoid any inducement to popu-
lation growth, Grubb (1989) suggests that allocations should
be restricted to population above a certain age. This has been
criticized for “discriminating against children” (though, like
all international allocation proposals, it says nothing about
distribution within countries). Grubb et al. (1992) note a
wider range of possibilities for avoiding any incentive to pop-
ulation growth, including “lagged” allocations (where the
allocation for a given year corresponds to the country’s
population a specified number of years before that date) or al-
locations apportioned to a fixed historical date or including an
explicit term related inversely to population growth rate.

a re _
of equal per capita entitlements
involves several proposals for equal historical or stock entitle-
ments. Fujii (1990), Ghosh (1993) and Meyer (1995) propose
that everyone should have an equal right to identical emis-
sions, regardless of country and generation. Ghosh (1993) ar-
gues that this can be derived from a range of diverse ethical
principles including Rawlsianism, traditional utilitarianism.
and even libertarianism.’ The general justifications for histor-
ical responsibilities in various forms are discussed further
below. Grubler and Fujii (1991) and Meyer (1995) have
developed detailed systems of accounts involving intergener-
ational transfer of the responsibility for past excess per capita
emissions by the industrialized countries, with the former
allowing for progressive absorption of past emissions: den
Elzen er al. (1993) apply the idea with an energy model toa
total carbon budget defined over 1800-2100. All these studies
indicate that the industrialized countries have “overused” the
atmosphere in the past, and in most such approaches have
built up a large “debt” whereas the developing countries are in
“credit.”

At the opposite end of the spectrum, Young and Wolf (1992),
for example, have suggested, but not necessarily advocated,
an alternative principle for emission allocation based on the
“status quo.” According to this view, past emitters should not
only be held harmless but their current rate of emissions
would constitute a status quo right established by past usage
and custom. Analogies are drawn with the common law prin-

“pollution rights have no common law sanction.”

A form in which historical contributions are considered as
a determinant of emissions allocation, other than historical
egalitarianism, is a scheme examined by Grubler and Naki-
cenovic (1991) in which countries have to cut back from cur-
rent levels in direct proportion to their responsibility for past
increases. In a sense, therefore, this is a mixed system. In re-
quiring cutbacks from all countries — albeit more from the
richer countries — it is probably inconsistent with the other
principles sketched in the previous section (though modifica-

The various allocation proposals present an apparently
confusing array. Paterson (1994/1996) sceks to trace each of

proaches can be grouped in terms of two main “focal” ap-
proaches: equal per capita allocation, which subsumes the
more general Rawls/Beitzian and basic needs principles, and
approaches related to the status quo, which subsume the prin-
ciples of willingness to pay and comparable burdens. These
focal approaches could be identified broadly with developing
and developed country preferences respectively, but in reality
all the longer-term proposals defy simple delineation along
such lines.

A strict status quo allocation — proportionate to current
emissions — would violate all the more general principles out-
lined in the previous section. In fact, no one in the literature
appears to advocate strict status quo as an equity principle in
its own right. It has, however, received widespread reference
as a basis or starting point position from analysts taking a
pragmatic or game-theoretic approach (e.g., Barrett, 1992), in
that it is the default allocation that would arise in the absence
of agreement. It is also the only specific allocation basis
which does not automatically impose big burdens on the in-
dustrialized countries. In such treatments the ethical basis,
where considered, is usually referred back to concepts of
equal burdens. It should be emphasized that in this context
status quo is not a static concept, but rather can refer to start-
ing from a baseline of what emissions would have been in the
absence of abatement. It could thus allow for more rapid
growth from developing countries.

amine a mixed system in more detail, and an almost identical
formulation was proposed independently by Welsch (1993).
These authors suggest an allocation which links egalitarian
and status quo/comparable burden principles by combining
population and current emission factors. They do not, how-
ever, specify an equal weighting of these components. Rather,
they argue that the weighting accorded to population should
increase over time towards a purer per capita allocation.
Grubb and Sebenius suggest that the weighting would have to
be determined through negotiation, the outcome of which
would partly reflect the strength of the competing equity argu-
ments employed. Welsch (1993) proposes a 50-year transition
from current emissions in the year 2000 to per capita alloca-
tion in the year 2050 and presents sample calculations of the
distribution of costs this could involve.

The initial allocation would be the principal means of de-

greater than their needs, and leave richer countries with a

poorer countries. The “outcome” equity issues involved thus

The third approach is to seek a basis to determine directly

consequence of future emission allocations. To a large extent
the general equity issues involved parallel those involved in
considering fair emission allocations, with ideas based, for
example, on interpretations of Rawlsian criteria, equal bur-
dens, and willingness to pay. But the limited literature ad-
dressing the question in this form places relatively more
emphasis on two other components: responsibility for emis-

The principle of using cumulative historical emissions di-
rectly as a component in determining payment (or future
emission allocations) is considered by these authors as a nat-
ural and important matter of equity. and many others also ar-
gue the central equity importance of historical emissions in
more general terms. Some of these authors recognize a variely
of potential practical difficulties, such as how far back the
emission estimates should go; whether the natural decay (re-
absorption) of emissions should be taken into account and, if
so, how; which gases should be included. given the highly
variable quality and in some cases complete absence of data;
and how to relate the emissions to scale (e.g., cumulative pop-

In part this reflects different potential definitions of the “nat-
ural debt” concept. However, at the same time as espousing
the Fujii formulation of intergenerational egalitarianism,
Ghosh (1993) criticizes the “natural debt” concept as a basis
of historical responsibility on the grounds that it is an abstract,
environment-centred focus which “does not acknowledge re-
sponsibility to others for one’s actions [and] does not relate to

A wholly different quantified approach to the question of who

Heal (1994), who apply the concepts of classical economics to
construct a strictly utilitarian formulation that seeks to maxi-
mize the sum of utilities across all countries, in other words,
to aggregate world utility. They argue that the independence
of distribution and efficiency so central to the welfare eco-
nomics of markets for private goods is not a characteristic of
markets for environmental public goods such as the atmos-
phere. As mentioned previously, these authors noted that, in a
situation without international transfers, efficient marginal
abatement costs would vary between countries. If unrestricted
lump-suin transfers are allowed, however, in order to recover
the classical solution in which marginal abatement costs are
equalized to achieve efficiency, only certain distributions of

plied to the idea that industrialized countries might invest in
projects in other countries, particularly developing countries,
to reduce or sequester greenhouse gas emissions. Industrial-
ized countries consider that the main incentives arise if some
or all of the emission savings can be credited towards the

(IDCJI) — also referred to in the literature as North-South
Joint Implementation (NSJI) — might involve project-level in-

“donor” country on the territory of a “host” country. This in-
volves a number of equity issues that underpin the political

concerning proposals for international tradable permits, in
which the issues would arise primarily. though not exclu-
sively, from the allocation of initial emission rights between
legally equivalent parties. Dubash (1994) explores the many

The effects are complex, however, particularly concerning
oil. First, one initial response to reduce CO, emissions could
be to burn more fuel oil in power stations in place of coal.
Furthermore, gas — which in power stations emits about half
as much CO, as coal — is very likely to be favoured in CO,
abatement strategies, and gas resources are often associated
with oil deposits and also with many coal mines. The overall
impact also depends very much on the time horizon consid-
ered. Heal (1984) noted that, in general, aversion to climatic
risks would tend to flatten the use of carbon resources over
time: Peak and initial usage would be lower, but usage would
also fall more slowly, partly because the resource base would
be extended over time. Manne and Rutherford (1994) provide
a more detailed energy analysis, concluding that “carbon re-
strictions tend to depress oil prices in the near term, but to in-
crease them in the long term . . . oil is less carbon-intensive
than coal-based synthetic fuels. and hence oil enjoys a pre-
mium.” They also find that carbon restrictions improve the
prospects and price for gas exports.

"IDCJI could impose hidden administrative and/or op-

IDCJI could “skim off’ the cheapest projects, so that, if
and when developing countries are required to adopt
emission constraints in the future, they will be faced
with higher marginal abatement costs (e.g., Parikh,
1994, and many others).

If IDCJI allows industrialized countries to continue in-
creasing their own emissions, it will perpetuate - and
perhaps even exacerbate - global inequalities in per
capita emissions rather than tending towards any long-
term convergence (Parikh and Gokarn, 1993: Loske and
Oberthur, 1993).

By reducing the pressure on the industrialized countries
to take domestic action, IDCJI may reduce incentives
for technical advance and innovation that could lower
costs for all in future abatement (Loske. 1991). A slower
pace of technical innovation may ttself differentially in-
crease the future costs to developing countries (Ghosh
and Puri. 1994).

ating poverty or delivering social services in many contexts.

the protection of important areas during such contractions.
These critics argue that the conventional approach is subopti-

of vulnerable groups — women, children, the poor, the rural
population, labour, and the aged population — who are forced
to carry a disproportionate burden of the adjustment. As part
of their argument, Cornia and Joliy (1984) and Cornia et al.
(1987) documented successful cases in which government
policies managed to protect vulnerable groups while bringing
structural adjustment. The result of these studies has been a
remarkable turnaround in the conventional wisdom on struc-
tural adjustment. From a situation of almost total neglect of
the social sector and vulnerable groups in the 1980s, current
policies include the protection of these sectors and groups as
integral elements of structural adjustment programmes.

Structural adjustment or “stabilization” becomes necessary
when the aggregate expenditure (or consumption) of a coun-
try begins systematically to exceed its aggregate income. The
result is the accumulation of debt at an unsustainable and un-
serviceable rate. In the 1970s, these difficulties were seen as
part of the short-term problems of cyclical fluctuations and
were responded to with the short-term measures of stabiliza-
tion, on the pattern of similar problems and policy responses
in developed countries. Subsequently, it was recognized that
the problem was of a longer-term duration and structural
rather than cyclical; in other words, the problems emerged not
because of the normal functioning of a business cycle, but be-

was designed to produce these results on a systematic basis. In

The performance of these policies has come under consid-

and Jolly, 1984; Cornia et a/., 1987). Earlier critics argued
that the orthodox adjustment programmes were both ineffec-

supply-side approaches, which aimed to increase production
directly through investment promotion, labour training, direct
export promotion, and income policies. Many of these recom-
mendations are extremely sound, but experience shows that
they have to be combined in varying proportions with ortho-
dox demand contraction policies. Also, the hope for a win-win
solution, in which the costs of adjustment would be avoided
altogether has not been vindicated by experience. The eco-

that some degree of economic contraction is inevitable during
structural adjustment, if only to dampen the inflationary ex-

"To state all of this somewhat differently, equity considera-
tions are germane to the climate change issue in two different
contexts — equitable distribution of the costs (or benefits) of
the change, and equitable contribution to amelioratory and
preventive actions. Neither experience is without precedent in
national contexts. There is an extensive literature on the dis-
tributional impacts of the business cycles, supply shocks (e.g.,
the oil price increases in the 1970s), economic development,
and episodes of structural adjustment and liberalization. In all
such cases, the questions are similar to the ones being raised
in the present situation, namely, how is the burden of the
change to be shared, and who should pay for amelioratory or
preventive actions. This literature can be divided into two
groups, that which looks at governmental policies within a

In this context, equity has been taken to mean income dis-
tribution. There is a literature on the appropriate index to be
used to measure income distribution. Starting with the Lorenz
Curve and the Gini coefficient, a number of improvements
have been proposed. The Gini coefficient is an index of the in-
equality of relative income shares, with zero representing
complete equality and one representing complete inequality.
Subsequently, attention shifted to other indicators, such as
absolute poverty — measured in terms of the number of peo-
ple below a nutrition-based poverty line and quality of life
(Morris, 1979) — and basic human needs, namely education,
food, health, water supply, sanitation, and housing (Streeten,

"The thrust of these arguments is that economic develop-

within countries in specific ways. The earlier view was that
income distribution would worsen with economic growth be-
fore getling better. However, the more recent evidence sug-
gests that the pattern of change is sensitive to policy choices
and institutional conditions in individual countries. Countries
that followed proactive policies, and favoured investment in
social sectors (education, health, social welfare) were able to
pursue economic growth and social development simultane-
ously. In other words, at least insofar as the experience of de-
velopment is concerned, a win-win solution is possible. There
are, however, considerable differences over the factors con-
tributing to win-win solutions. Neoliberal writers (e.g.. Bal-

industrializing countries to market-based, outward-oriented

¢ The first lesson is that “blind” or neutral policies have
not performed well. As a result, the need to protect the
social sector and some targeted groups has become
widely accepted. In the climate change context, this
means that such “blind” policies as a carbon tax, or even
tradable permits, will have to be supplemented with
policies to protect vulnerable groups and vulnerable
sectors.

 

¢ In general, the experience of structural adjustment
shows that policy responses need to be sensitive to the
economic, political, and institutional contexts of various.
countries. Reliance on a formulaic approach has often
been ineffective if not counterproductive.

e The experience with heterodox approaches to stabiliza-
tion suggests that these need to be combined in varying
proportions with the orthodox, demand-contraction
policies. In the climate change context this means that
pure win-win solutions based on technological opti-
mism — namely the expectation that technological im-
provements alone will suffice to reduce emissions to
sustainable levels — are unlikely to produce the desired
results unless combined with steps to reduce aggregate
consumption.

Be that as it may, two points are significant in this debate.
First, that it may be more germane to look at property rights.
whether formal or informal, rather than consumption or pro-
duction patterns alone. Second, that there is an interrelation-
ship between economic and ethical considerations. As Gore
points out, “for Sen, policies to counter hunger and famine
must ultimately be justified through foundational arguments
about what is valuable. Equally. ethical assessment of institu-
tions, such as property rights, requires empirical analysis of
causes and effects” (Gore, 1993).

One strand of this argument has been made by Sen (1976)
and various others in terms of “entitlements.” In Sen’s ap-
proach, crises, such as famines, occur not because of a short-
age of food but because of a failure of entitlements, namely
rights to commodities. However, as Gore (1993) has argued,
in much of his work Sen focuses on entitlements conferred by
the formal legal system. Although in the examination of in-
trafamily distribution (Sen, 1984) he extends the analysis to
include informal entitlements as wel], this does not seem to
have affected the exclusive focus on the formal legal system
in the remaining corpus of his work.

"This provides a somewhat different slant on the literature
cited earlier. It could be argued that the need for structural ad-
justment arises when the sum total of property rights exceeds
the available aggregate endowment of assets or resources. The
solution then is to reduce the command over goods and ser-
vices by reallocating or eliminating some property rights.
These might include the rights of the government (generated
through money creation), or those of groups favoured by dis-
tributional policies or subsidies, or even of investors who are
allowed to borrow at highly subsidized rates. The argument of
the critics is that in this reallocation of rights, it would be dif-

cannot take advantage of global opportunities, or suffer dis-
proportionately from adverse global processes, if they lack
the institutional capacity to protect their interests. Finally,
countries that exhibit superior performance on one indicator
of social welfare also perform better on virtually every other
indicator. This means that rather than trade-offs between dif-
ferent goals, there is a clustering of performance around vari-
ous goals. This can only be explained by institutional factors
that favour some countries over others. The solution for coun-
tries that perform poorly is to enhance their national institu-

pursue collective goals. Analogously, the solution for weak or
marginalized groups is also to enable them to make collective

At an individual level, the choice of protecting the
rights of various people will be influenced by cultural
arrangements, which favour men over women.

In most countries, declines in food availability will fall
disproportionately on the politically weaker and rela-
tively passive groups, on the poor, the children, women,
older people, the unemployed, and the rural people.

Not only is this likely to produce conflict, but the emer-
gence of conflict will further discriminate against the
weaker and more peaceable groups (Suliman, 1992).
Major technological or political changes in agriculture
result typically in expropriation of tenants and landless
poor. Attempts to offset these consequences through
land reforms have had only limited impact (Moyo,

"These considerations are relevant for the examination of
climate change issues. Insofar as the climate change issue is
also one of property rights (or entitlements) exceeding the to-
tal endowment of planetary sinks, the response will necessar-

is that blind policies are likely to reallocate the property rights
in an inequitable manner by curtailing the entitlements of the
poor disproportionately. This is true for countries as well as
for groups within countries. Given the fact that the developing

lesser flexibility, is closer to subsistence, and lacks the institu-

This is not the only possibility however. An alternative ap-
proach, which would be sensitive to Arendt’s criticism, sees
culture and values (including equity) as foundational and as
developed through experience. This is implicit in Rawls’s ar-
gument, when he says that “the primary subject of justice is
the basic structure of society” (Rawls, 1971). Following this,
Michael Sandel (1982) has commented that “For a society to
be just in this strong [Rawlsian] sense, justice must be consti-
tutive of its framework and not simply an attribute of certain

courage, truth, goodness, are not based on general rules but on
concrete experiences. If one takes this point of view, the
search for universal rules is dangerous as well as futile. Jus-
tice lies in experience, not in transcendental rules. Equity and
efficiency do not collide as contrasting goals. We cannot have
efficiency in an inequitable society.

"Equity, justice, fair play are all concepts with strong moral
and ethical overtones, The literature that has been discussed
exhibits these overtones cither explicitly or implicitly. It is
fair to say, however, that the policy-oriented literature seeks
an ethically neutral stance. It is based on a technocratic ap-
proach, which focusses on the means or instruments to given
or agreed goals. In this approach, the only ethical considera-
tions pertain to the goals, not to the means through which the
goals are to be achieved. The goal of this literature is to deter-
mine a universal formula for decision making. Differences be-
tween philosophers pertain not to this search for a universal
formula but to the contents of the formula.

Both these perspectives. which are two of the most salient
recent analyses of the issue of justice, derive from a “conse-
quentialist” position, in which values have to be justified by
outcomes — even if they are defended by processes. Hannah
Arendt (1961) has made a scathing critique of such ap-
proaches, by arguing that they are based on a confusion be-
tween meanings and values as well as between values and
goals. The result is that everything is reduced in the end to
means, In this approach, culture and values become mere in-
struments for the achievement of particular goals (¢.g.. devel-
opment). Indeed. even equity is but an instrument for the
pursuit of such goals as economic growth or political stability.

However, this perspective presupposes an alternative insti-
tutional structure, in which the experience of value creation
can become possible again. This structure must build on
small, decentralized communities, in which the scope for
judgment is reestablished. This would go against the broad
trends of twentieth-century development, which have been in
the direction of greater centralization and concentration and
have also been accompanied by the transfer of all collective
rights to the state. In the realm of economics, therefore. they
have left an amoral universe, in which equity can only be an
instrument for the achievement of some other goal, not a
value in its own right.

" 

This distinction is not simply that between outcomes and
processes. For example, Nozick (1974) argues for liberty as
the primary principle, not only in its own right but as the
definitive feature of equity. This is generally taken to be an
example of process-oriented ethics. However, it too is conse-
quentialist, in that it assumes a transcendental goal, which can
be achieved through the appropriate institutions — in this case
free markets. Similarly, Rawls (1971) analyzes the concept of
justice from an individualistic viewpoint to argue for a
Solomonic veil of ignorance that would induce each individ-
ual to seek a maximin solution. If this could be agreed. pre-
sumably we could also agree to establish institutions (a
government, a judiciary) that would put our values into ac-

Procedural equity is an aspect of institutions, and the con-
struction of international institutions is partly about establish-
ing structures that command widespread adherence because
they offer adequately fair representation. The painstaking
negotiations over the Global Environmental Facility. for

A related problem is that of institutional coordination
within countries. Climate change involves an extraordinary
diversity of issues and interests. ranging from meteorology to
international trade. Frequently, governments have trouble co-
ordinating policy between different internal groups — and in
the international arena it is indeed not uncommon for meteo-
rologists from developing countries to find themselves dis-
cussing issues that have more to do with international trade

policy.

These principles apply to the negotiations, associated
processes like the IPCC, and any institutional structures and
procedures created through negotiations. The principle of
seeking consensus among all participating states for interna-
tional agreements makes it still more important that partici-
pants feel that negotiations are conducted fairly and that they
feel able to participate effectively, and that states take part in
good faith. Countries that do not perceive a process to be fair
have great power to obstruct it, ensuring that negotiations
make little progress.

Concerns about the ability to participate effectively under-
lie the frequent insistence of many developing countries on
tules of procedure, such as the development of official nego-
tiating timetables without informal meetings outside this
agenda. To bigger and more advanced countries this can be an
intense irritation and may seem an unnecessary brake on
progress (which such procedures may indeed turn out to be).
To weaker and poorer participants they are seen as a protec-
tive device to give them a chance to keep up with discussions.
Again, it is an area where a fair compromise between ade-
ss and comprehensive participation is called for.

Participation in international processes — at the simple leve! of
having nationals or other representatives present - is re-
stricted chiefly by limitations on human and financial re-
sources, though delays in obtaining visas and the sheer
difficulty of travel from some developing countries can also
be important constraints. For some processes (like the IPCC).
financial constraints on travel from poorer countries are ad-

Another aspect of participation is that of nongovernmental

That said, it is obviously unrealistic to expect universal
participation in everything. Indeed it would be a huge waste
of scarce human and financial resources and would in a sense
be unfair to participants with more urgent priorities. In prac-
tice, the smaller countries — in both the industrialized and
developing world — are selective about their participation
through choice as well as need, without necessarily adverse
consequences. Smaller countries may be able to rely on larger
neighbours that share common interests or may otherwise be
able to ensure that their concerns are reflected through dele-
gated or grouped responsibilities. Luxembourg. for example,
generally has little difficulty signing on to agreements in
whose formation it played no direct part. And. as noted ear-
lier, addressing climate change requires widespread but not
necessarily universal participation. Where universal partici-
pation is impractical or even undesirable, what matters is en-
suring that a fair balance of interests and perceptions is
represented.

The overall literature on institutions is very large, and
there is an extensive literature (especially in the U.S.) about
institutions for managing global environmental affairs (e.g..
Millennium, 1990; WRI, 1991: Choucri, 1994). The academic
literature specifically on practical aspects of equity in interna-
tional institutions for managing global environmental affairs
is, however, much smaller. Among the most important studies
in this corpus is the report of the IPCC Special Committee on
the Participation of Developing Countries (IPCC, 1990). This
identified five areas of particular concern that might inhibit
adequate involvement: “insufficient information, insufficient
communication, limited human resources. institutional diffi-
culties, and limited financial resources.” Here we group these
more broadly under “participation” and “information,” each
including the question of adequate resources. “Resources” is
used in the broad sense of the word; it encompasses human re-
sources, financial resources, institutions. and infrastructure
that can underlie adequate participation in and information for

A number of these elements have been discussed in Section
3.6 above. Given the complexity of the climate change issue,
this points to the ultimate inseparability of issues such as fair
and informed participation between the national and interna-

many different levels.

Again this reflects a mix of problems: a lack of human

Scientific analyses cannot prescribe how social issues

applied in implementing the Convention, but analysis can
clarify the implications of alternative choices and their ethical
basis. There are a variety of meanings of equity. and there are
various principles that have been designed to achieve equity.

Thus, we come full circle to the observation at the begin-
ning of this chapter. Perceived justice, in terms of representa-
tion and consideration of different perspectives in processes
and in big decisions, is one of the basic measures of legiti-
macy for governmental institutions. Equivalent structures in-
ternationally are weak or nonexistent. But the climate issue
forces recognition of global interdependence. For negotia-
tions to be effective. they need to command widespread ac-
ceptance as fair processes, reaching decisions that are fair

tutes an equitable outcome, and thus reflecting the range of is-

The importance of adequate information cannot be over-
stressed. Many bad policy decisions can be traced to inade-
quate information, and so can many of the difficulties in
international negotiations. The feeling that some participants
are much better informed than others can, and frequently
does, lead to a suspicious and obstructive attitude in negotia-
tions that ultimately may be to the detriment of all. It was
noted above that in international affairs, countries often do
fail even to reach agreements that would be of mutual benefit.
Lack of adequate information - compounded by the distrust
this can help to generate — is one root cause of this. Negotia-
tions are difficult enough when cach country is seeking only

to pursue a narrowly defined self-interest. They can be even
more difficult when states do not have a clear idea of where
their self-interest lies.

"Equity and social considerations are central to discussions of
steps to be taken to implement the Framework Convention on
Climate Change because widespread participation is essential
if the objectives of the Convention are to be gained. This is
why the concept of equity is so prominent in the Convention.
Countries are unlikely to participate fully unless they perceive
the arrangements to be equitable. This applies particularly to
equily among regions and countries, but equity within coun-
tries. and associated social considerations, are also important
influences on what is possible and desirable. Mitigating and
adapting to climate change will require actions on the part of
individuals. Governments will find it easier to comply with
international obligations if their citizens feel that the obliga-
tions and benefits of compliance are distributed among them
equitably. And richer countries are unlikely to burden their
poorer citizens to benefit relatively rich citizens in poor coun-
tries.

Perhaps a bigger problem than adequate participation is the
need for adequate information for those who participate. Cli-
mate change issues are complex. The work of the IPCC, for
example, spans issues ranging from atmospheric science to
ecology to economics. OECD representatives, in particular,
can draw on a huge infrastructure of specialist knowledge and
analysis in developing policy positions and arguing for them
(even if researchers still feel that insufficient attention is paid
to their work, and negotiators feel deluged by research much
of which is peripheral or naive). Many developing countries
feel seriously disadvantaged by not having adequate research
capacity to draw on. [tis striking, for example, that the Indian
Minister of Finance expressed such a concern (on a different
issue), despite India’s having one of the most advanced policy
research capabilities in the developing world (Singh, 1993).

This focus on developed/developing country interaction is
also apparent in much of the literature. which seeks to clarify
considerations of equity between developed and developing
countries much more than among developed countries. Since
developed countries have obligations under the treaty to take
immediate action, this is a serious lacuna. There are, however,
a variety of specific analyses that propose schemes for distrib-

rights and that analyze the distributional effects of these

a problem like climate change needs to be managed rationally and

"Issues relating to equity among regions and countries stem
from the substantial differences that exist among countries.
Countries differ not only in terms of size, resources, popula-

gases, vulnerability to climate change, and institutional capa-
bilities to respond effectively to climate change. There is no
single method of aggregating these differences and no deci-

on Climate Change provides considerable guidance for apply-
ing the concept of equity to take account of the many differ-

specific circumstances will require further elaboration of the
Convention’s principles and obligations, many of which were
designed to be ambiguous and remain so.

3. Smith and Ahuja (1990) present succint and strong reasons for
considering the range of gases in assessing individual projects, to-
gether with a general framework indicating a basis on which such
comparisons might be developed. At the aggregate level required for
international comparisons and considerations of equity, the issues
are somewhat different. The best data, and most analysis, have fo-
cussed on the major contribution from CO, ~ especially from fossil
fuels. for which national emissions are generally known to within +
5% (uncertainty range of 10%) or better. CFC emissions — measured
as defined in the Montreal Protocol - are known to similar accuracy.
Other sources are more uncertain. National estimates of CO, and
other emissions from deforestation and other land use changes can
vary by at least + 30%. both for individual countries and in aggre-
gate. Most methane emissions are similarly uncertain. Contributions
from other gases (N,O and various oth uses involved in different
uspects of atmospheric chemistry) are still more uncertain, but the
global impact of these other emissions probably totals less than 10%
of the major greenhouse gases. Further difficulties are introduced in
attempting to compare the radiative impact of different gases, as dis-

This equation sets out explicitly the two reasons for dis-
counting future consumption: either (1) one cares less about
tomorrow's consumer than today’s, or about one’s own wel-
fare tomorrow than today (reflected in the first term, p): or
else (2) one believes tomorrow’s consumer will be better off
than today’s (reflected in the second term, @g). For a discus-

The trade-off between consumption today and consump-

think about this trade-off; second, what numerical value to at-
tach to it. Many economists subscribe to a general framework
that focusses on the social marginal utility of consumption to-
day compared with consumption in the future. In this frame-
work, the discount rate can be expressed as:

"Economists are in general agreement that cost-benefit analy-

with long or complex time paths, or policies whose effects
extend across generations (see, for example, Layard, 1976;

analysis, and the techniques that go with it, including dis-
counting, focus on economic efficiency, and therefore have
limitations as a guide to policy.>

Determining the appropriate discount rate involves issues
in normative as well as positive economics. These two per-
spectives raise very different questions. From a normative or
ethical perspective, the key question might be: “How (ethi-

a positive perspective, the appropriate question might be: “To
what extent will investments made to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions displace investments elsewhere?”

"The discount rate allows economic effects occurring at differ-

dollar amount associated with a project into the equivalent
present dollar amount. The discount rate is generally positive
because resources invested today can be transformed into, on
average, more resources later; this holds for investments in
both physical capital (¢.g., machines) and human capital (e.g.,
education),

The debate is often confusing, in part because three sepa-
rate issues are being addressed: how to discount the welfare or
utility of future generations, how to discount future dollars.
and how to discount future pollution. Further, the argument
often combines questions of efficiency and questions of
ethics. Although economists can make no special claim to
professional expertise in questions of ethics, they have devel-
oped rigorous methods for analyzing the implications of ethi-
cal judgments.

investment: Money is spent today to reduce the costs of cli-

in greenhouse gas controls exceeds the rate of return on in-

would be better off if less were invested today in machines
and education and more in controlling greenhouse gas emis-

There is also a general consensus about certain basic prin-
ciples of discount rate analysis. Most economists believe that
considerations of risk can be treated by converting outcomes
into certainty equivalents, amounts that reflect the degree
of risk in an investment and discounting these certainty
equivalents. There is general agreement that in evaluating
competing projects, all spending. including investment. is to
be converted into consumption equivalents first, then dis-
counted (Arrow and Kurz. 1970; Lind er a/., 1982). Environ-
mental impacts may be incorporated by converting them to
consumption equivalents, then discounting. Many people ex-
pect the relative price of environmental goods to increase over
time. which would have consequences equivalent to adopting
a lower discount rate for such goods at unchanged prices

The benefits of greenhouse gas abatement accrue decades
or even centuries in the future. For this reason, use of a high
discount rate results in a low present value of actions that
slow climate change. For example, at a discount rate of 7%
annually (as is commonly used in short-horizon project analy-
sis), damages of $1 billion 50 years hence have a present
value of only [$1 x LO°|/[ 1.07%} = $33.9 million; the same
damages 200 years hence have a present value of only $1300.
Thus the use of too high a discount rate will result in too little
value placed on avoiding climate change and too little invest-
ment in climate change programmes. Conversely, applying too
low a discount rate to climate change programmes will result
in too much investment in them and crowd out better uses of
the resources.

The SRTP approach values the total change in consump-
tion at each date, not just the direct outputs of the project.
Where mitigation projects displace other investment, future
consumption must be reduced by the consumption that the
displaced investment projects would have generated. (This
requires an explicit analysis of the project’s effects on con-
sumption and investment.) The SRTP is then applied to net
consumption. In effect, all results are converted to their con-
sumption equivalents, U then discounted ; at the SRTP.

"Economists disagree, however, about several other issues
that affect the choice of a discount rate, including key parame-
ters such as the likely rate of future per capita economic
growth and the changing relative scarcity of environmental
goods. These calculations require economic judgments about
the degree of economic efficiency reflected in market out-
comes, the extent of constraints on policy, and the proper ap-
proach to distributional concerns. Disagreements on these
points drive the differences in conclusions about the discount
rate.

"The prescriptive approach, which is usually associated with a
relatively low discount rate, begins with a social welfare func-
tion (an algebraic formulation that “adds up” the consumption
of different individuals. yielding a measure of the well-being
of society as a whole) constructed from ethical principles.
Those who hold the prescriptive view typically argue that
market interest rates often provide a poor indicator of the mar-
ginal trade-offs to society, because of market imperfections
and suboptimal tax (and sometimes expenditure) policy, and
because of constraints on policy, especially the difficulty in
making transfers to future generations.

"The second term, 4g, reflects discounting for rising con-
sumption (or consumption equivalents). If per capita con-
sumption is growing at rate g, then an extra unit of consump-
tion in the next period should be discounted by the term @g to
take account of the lower marginal utility of consumption at
higher consumption levels. Even if present and future genera-
tions are given equal weight, so that pure time preference is
zero (p = 0), future consumption would still be discounted if
later generations are expected to be better off; in this case, an
extra unit of consumption would not be worth as much in the
future as it is today. For example, if technical change contin-
ues at the pace of the last century, with productivity and living
standards doubling about every thirty years, then this high
value of g would push up the SRTP. This means that an addi-
tional unit of consumption by future generations, who would
be much richer than we are, would count much less than an
additional unit of consumption today.®

It is appropriate to apply @ discount rate to public and
private investment, including regulatory decisions. This
discount rate should be derived from ethical considera-
tions, reflecting society’s views concerning trade-offs of
consumption across generations.

Because of practical limits on the feasibility of intergen-
erational transfers, and in the absence of optimal tax
policy.’ the SRTP will in general fall below the producer
rate of interest.

The cost of a greenhouse mitigation project must in-
clude the forgone benefits of other competing invest-
ments not undertaken. This means that costs should be
adjusted for the shadow price of capital, the present
value of the future consumption yielded by a unit of
capital. Ifa mitigation project would displace private in-
vestment, and returns to both projects accrue to the
same generations, then it is appropriate to use the op-
portunity cost of capital — the return that the private in-
vestor would have received from the forgone capital
investment. Only after doing this will it be appropriate
to use the social rate of time preference to discount con-
sumption.

1% (perhaps because of slower growth after 100 years), or if

Mitigation expenditures displace other forms of invest-

greatest total consumption (Nordhaus, 1994), !?

If the return on mitigation investments lies below that of
other investments, then choosing other investments
would make current and future generations better off.
Transfers to future generations, if necessary, are to be
considered separately.

The appropriate social welfare function to use for in-

choices (hence the name, descriptive approach). Believ-
ing that no justification exists for choosing an SWF
different from what decision makers actually use, ad-

Further, as Manne (1994) demonstrates, a low SRTP im-

But tax policy in most OECD countries significantly de-

What conclusion to draw from this evidence depends on
whether tax policy is viewed as a constraint or as the result of

Pure time preference. The earliest economics literature, in
addressing these issues, argued that the appropriate value of p
was zero (Ramsey, 1928). Ramsey based his argument on the
ethical presumption that all individuals, including those living
in different generations, should be valued the same. The argu-
ment since then has advanced only slightly. Some have argued
that the discount rate should be adjusted for the probability of
extinction, Plausible estimates of this effect would add very
little to the discount rate. Others have pointed out that a posi-
tive discount rate is needed for acceptable optimization re-
sults: In the absence of a discount factor, the sum of future
utilities may be infinite, so that the mathematics of maximiz-

very small positive discount rate. however, would resolve the
mathematical issue, this objection has little practical moment.

elasticities of marginal utilities lie in the range of | to 2. even
though the empirical studies require strong assumptions about
the specific form of the utility function (symmetric and time
separable), Thus, one of the most commonly used utility fune-

rises by 1% the marginal utility of consumption falls by 1c.
Attempts by Fellner (1967) and Scott (1989) to estimate this

treatment of risk in models involving impacts over a single
individual’s life is not to raise the discount rate for riskier
projects, but instead to convert probabilistic consumption
patterns into their certainty equivalents and then discount the
results at the standard rate. The same should be true for the

There would seem to be an argument for varying the
growth-based component of the SRTP with respect to risk,
however. If there is uncertainty about the rate of per capita in-
come growth, g, then consider the effect on the component 0g
in the SRTP. Suppose two scenarios each have 50% probabil-
ity: per capita income growth of 1% and per capita growth of
2%. There will be two resulting possible streams of marginal
utility over time. The stream of expected value of marginal
utility will be the average of these two streams. But if mar-
ginal utility is a convex function of consumption, this average
will be greater than the stream of marginal utility generated
by considering the simple average growth rate over time,
1.5%. That is, with diminishing marginal utility. at any point
in time marginal utility along the path for 1.5% growth will be
closer to that of the 2% growth path than to that of the 1%
growth path. Correspondingly, the expected marginal utility
path lying halfway between the two scenarios will coincide
with the marginal utility stream for a growth rate closer to 1%
than to 2%. Essentially, the expected value of marginal utility
is greater than the marginal utility of expected income. On
this basis, there would be grounds for reducing the growth-
based component of the SRTP under circumstances of risk.
Because the risk in predicting per capita growth on centuries-
scale horizons is high, this consideration is particularly rele-
vant for the problem of global warming.

Prescriptionists emphasize that the market rate of interest —
the relative price of consumption of one generation in one
year of its life to its consumption in another year — will not in
general equal the SRTP. In standard life-cycle models, with
no technological progress and an economy in steady state,
there would be no discounting for society’s purposes: Each
generation is identical, so the marginal utility of consumption
of each is the same. Nonetheless, the market rate of interest
will be positive in any efficient equilibrium under certain
reasonable assumptions about utility functions (such as indi-
vidual impatience and zero bequest motive; Diamond, 1965).
In such models the market rate of interest would thus always
overestimate the SRTP. Under some special conditions, with
governments intervening with nondistorting taxation to opti-
mally redistribute income across generations, observed mar-
ket rates of interest will accord with the SRTP. But these are
highly specialized conditions (see Stiglitz, 1985; Pestieau,

reflects the opportunity cost of capital, which strongly affects
the changes in consumption generated by any change in
policy.

result is equivalent to using a low (or even negative) discount
rate for environmental amenities with prices unchanged.
However, this process involves properly valuing future envi-
ronmental benefits in arriving at the future flow of equivalent
consumption, and does not change the discount rate to apply
to the consumption stream.

the “Golden Rule,” which is that configuration of the econ-

be maintained indefinitely. A recent extension has proposed
the “Green golden rule” (Beltratti et a/., 1993). The recent
economic debate on sustainable development has focussed on
two issues: (1) intertemporal equity and (2) capital accumula-
tion and substitutability. The extent to which natural and cul-
tural resources are substitutable is critical to this analysis and
is contentious. Many economists (for example, Pearce and

Even the utilitarian approach (@ < ee) would tend to lead
to higher general income transfers to poor countries than
presently observed, Adherents of the descriptive approach
might ask why the utilitarian construct is appropriate when
considering intergenerational equity (as in the identification
of the SRTP suggested in equation (4.1)) if it is not applied in
practice across or even within countries now. In one sense.
this question is another application of the principle suggested
above, that in the absence of optimal redistribution interven-
tion by government, observed market rates (in this case of

In many developing countries, Solow’s definition would
not be viewed as acceptable, since it seems to place no weight
on their aspirations for growth and development. Further. for-
mal models analyzing optimal development paths using a
max-min (Rawlsian) criterion would focus exclusively on the
welfare of the less developed countries. (Note that in Rawls’
formulation, @ = ee.) But the remedy would be simple: imme-
diate massive redistribution from the developed to the devel-
oping countries, with no environmental justification required.
Even if there were limits on the transfers, this remedy would
suggest that all the costs of mitigation — including those oc-
curring within the developing economies — be borne by the
developed countries.

"Finally, there has been considerable discussion about the
proper discounting method for environmental projects of in-
stitutions such as the Global Environmental Facility of the
World Bank (see, e.g.. Munasinghe, 1993). The method that
follows from the social cost-benefit approach is to obtain con-
sumption equivalents of the environmental effects over time
and then apply the appropriate discount rate. Within a fixed
institutional investment budget, it may be that the collection
of potential projects that successfully passes a cost-benefit
test on this basis more than exhausts available funds. If so, ef-
ficient trade-offs within the menu of projects will appropri-
ately involve cutoffs ata higher shadow price in funds drawn

way discounting is generally applied to climate change projects.
Schelling notes that discussions of discounting within the context of
climate change policy often confuse three ideas: (1) discounting for
consumption enjoyed in the future: (2) discounting for risk: and (3)
discounting for consumption by others.

6. The alternative view, which could be called environment-specific
egalitarianism, says that each good must be valued in isolation from
all others. This view stresses the need for limits to the use of re-
sources that will be needed or desired, but cannot be created, by fu-
ture generations (Pearce and Turner, 1990). In the extreme, this
belief, known as specific egalitarianism, argues that environmental
goods (and in some cases, each environmental good) must be treated
separately from all other goods and that each generation should en-
joy the same level of environmental benefits as previous generations.

rate, has yet to be resolved, The post-1973 slowing of productivity
increases in many OECD countries suggests the need for a reexami-
nation of historical trends and perhaps a reduction in the recom-
mended discount rate. These considerations have become particu-
larly important with the addition of intergenerational distributional
effects. Low-income groups within developed countries have seen a
sharp reduction in per capita income growth; this would lead to
lower discount rates. On the other hand. some developing countries
now enjoy high per capita income growth, suggesting a higher dis-
count rate. At 7% per capita income growth, and with @ = 1.5, the
discount rate would exceed 10% even with p set to zero,

Schelling points out that one thinks differently about one’s own
consumption than about the consumption of others, and that a key
feature of the climate change problem is that those likely to bear the
cost of mitigation (the developed counties) differ from those likely
to enjoy the benefits (the currently developing countries). Thus, says
Schelling, we should recognize that climate change mitigation is
more like foreign aid than it is like the usual public investments to
which we apply discounting. Foreign aid budgets are low because
the donors do not have strong feelings of concern for the beneficia-
ries. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, says Schelling, there
is No reason to impute much stronger moral sentiments to those who

will be paying for climate change mitigation.

The mainstream view in economics holds that future generations
can be compensated for decreases in environmental goods by offset-
ting accumulations of other goods (though increasing scarcity of
some environmental goods will require increasing amounts of capital
lo offset the loss of an additional unit of the environmental good).
Environmentalists may favour restricting the use of nonreproducible
environmental resources in a way entirely consistent with the main-
stream view, in that risk aversion in the matter of environmental
quality will affect the rate at which society trades environmental
goods for other goods, Only in the limiting case of infinite risk aver-
sion will no trade-offs be made. Thus, adherents of environment-
specific egalitarianism may back the same policies as risk-averse
adherents of the mainstream view.

Manne uses a standard growth model to examine the relation be-
tween discount rates and savings rates in the context of developed
economies. He finds that discount rates of | or 2% imply an unrealis-
tically rapid near-term increase in the rate of investment. Manne thus
concludes that a discount rate this low is grossly inconsistent with
observed or plausibly anticipated behaviour. On the other hand, pre-
scriptionists might interpret Manne’s analysis as showing simply that
the intertemporal equilibrium established by market economies dif-
fers markedly from that corresponding to the solution of an intertem-
poral maximization problem based on a social welfare function
derived from ethical considerations. But even if savings could be in-
creased enough to drive the discount rate to 1 or 2%, climate change
investments would still have to compete with many other public and
private investinents offering higher returns.

Economists consider two cases: (1) Pareto improvements — changes.
including compensation actually paid, that make everyone better off:
these are obviously desirable; and (2) changes that produce some
winners and some losers. To address the second case, economists
generally use a social welfare function, typically showing some pref-
erence for greater income equality (that is, increasing equality raises
social welfare). A considerable literature, building on the work of
Rothschild and Stigtitz (1973) has added precision to this idea. In
choosing an SWF, economist! so generally assume separability.
That is, the SWF can be written W = W(U,, .. .). The ethical idee un-
derlying this assumption is that society’s willingness to substitute
consumption between individuals / and j does not depend on the util-
ity or income of individual &, a form of the assumption of the inde-
pendence of irrelevant alternatives. Economists also generally
assume consumer sovereignty. That is, each individual's utility (en-
tering the SWF) is determined by that person’s own judgments, not
the judgments of society more generally.

ties of valuing some categories of ecological, cultural, and hu-
man health impacts. Nevertheless, CBA remains a valuable
framework for identifying the essential questions that policy-
makers must face when dealing with climate change. The
CBA approach forces decision makers to compare the conse-
quences of alternative actions. including that of no action, on
a quantitative basis. Indeed. the most important benefit of ap-
plying CBA may be the process itself (which forces a rigorous
approach to decision making) rather than the predicted out-
come (which always depends on the particular assumptions
and techniques used).

However, to evaluate cost-effectiveness, it is crucial to
clarify how the policy target is defined, because there are sev-
eral options in the global climate change context. Most recent
analyses of mitigation costs have focussed on a target based
on future emission levels,+ such as stabilization of the emis-
sion of certain greenhouse gases by a given year. However. it

The term has come to encompi

 

a wide variety of specific
techniques. We also review the basic concepts. In Section 5.3
we examine the unique features of global warming and cli-
mate change as they pertain to decision making. Section 5.4

"Another possible target, also affecting the cost-effective-

quences of climate change. Apart from the fact that pre-
dictions of these consequences are far more difficult to
make than forecasts of emissions and atmospheric concentra-
tions of greenhouse gases, the effects of regional differences
would have to be included if targets were based on the conse-
quences. For instance, whether climate change contributes to
sea level rise or to an increase in the frequency of rain storms
will be of quite different importance to people in Nepal and
the Netherlands. In this context, an additional problem arises
as to how to assess benefits from abatement of different con-

if emissions were not stabilized immediately. The reason is
that a more gradual reduction of emissions would avoid the
economic shock that would follow a sudden stabilization, en-

"In public policymaking, decision makers routinely compare
the perceived costs and perceived benefits of an action. Nev-
ertheless, their decisions are frequently made on intuitive and
qualitative grounds. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) provides an
analytical framework that seeks to compare the consequences
of alternative policy actions on a quantitative rather than a
qualitative basis. The basic principles are well understood and
straightforward: For an action to be justified, the costs of the
action should be less than the benefits derived therefrom.! If
there are several ulternatives, then one ought to pick that op-
tion whose benefits most exceed the costs.? Traditional cost-
benefit analysis requires that all costs and all benefits be
expressed in a common monetary unit to facilitate the com-
parison. Modern cost-benefit analysis also includes tech-
niques such as cost-effectiveness analysis and multicriteria
analysis to analyze trade-offs when some of the benefits
and/or costs can be quantified but cannot be expressed in

monetary units

BOX 5.1: TECHNIQUES OF MODERN COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS (CBA)
"	Title
"MCA addresses certain shortcomings of conventional CBA (like valuation problems), but it does not necessarily deal more
effectively with uncertainty. This complication has led to the development of a further extension of CBA known as decision
analysis, Here the focus is expressly on how one makes decisions under conditions of uncertainty. These techniques find ap-
plication in a wide variety of situations, from decision making in the high-risk field of wildcat oil drilling to analysis of fi-
nancial options. As we shall see below. such techniques provide a rational approach for dealing with irreversibility, one of
the more important characteristics of the climate change problem.

 
"	Text
"CBA evolved as a technique to evaluate and compare project alternatives. In the early years of its application, there was lit-
tle concern with externalities, and the analysis took into account just the direct costs of projects and the direct benefits. As it
was originally developed for use in industrial market economies, market prices provided appropriate guidance on how to
evaluate benefits. When the World Bank began to apply the technique to nonmarket economies, where prices were subject to
significant distortions, shadow pricing techniques provided simple corrections. For example, if an oil-importing country
kept the domestic price of oil at artificially low levels, CBA would require the use of the border price, not the domestic
price, as a basis for valuing oil.

"price, as a basis for valuing oll.

One of the central concepts in CBA is that of discounting, which addresses the fact that costs and benefits may not occur
at the same point in time. For example, whereas costly actions to avoid future climate change may need to be taken in the
near future, most of the benefits of such actions will occur in the distant future. Discounting enables one to take into account
the time value of money. In the case of evaluating simple investment alternatives over shorter time horizons (e.g., 15 years),
the use of the opportunity cost of capital as the discount rate to be applied to both costs and benefits is well established and
uncontroversial. However, in the case of complex public policy applications, particularly those whose time horizons are
very great and involve environmental impacts or the depletion of natural resources — essential characteristics of the global
climate change issue — there is sharp disagreement as to what discount rate is appropriate. This issue is dealt with in Section
5.5.2.1.
"	Text
"As CBA began to be applied to much broader contexts, and particularly to the comparison of alternative portfolios of proj-
ects and to broad policy choices, the increasing complexity made it desirable to keep the level of benefits constant and to an-
alyze the problem simply in terms of finding the most effective, or “least-cost” option to meet the desired level of benefits.
This has the additional advantage that benefits in some cases need not be explicitly valued. For example, in power sector
planning, models are applied to identify the capacity expansion plan whose present value of system costs is minimized,
given some exogenously specified time path of electricity demand and some exogenously specified level of reliability. As
we shall see below, this is the variant of CBA that has seen the most widespread application to the climate change problem,
in which one seeks to identify the least-cost option to achieve given levels of greenhouse gas emission reductions, without
any explicit attempt to specify what the benefits of that level of emission reduction may be.
"	Text
"The most basic requirement for the application of CBA is that both costs and benefits can be given economic value. This is
ypically a two-step process: first the costs and benefits must be quantified in terms of the physical measures that apply, and
hen those physical impacts must be valued in economic terms. Some applications of valuation techniques are likely to be
ontroverstal. Putting a value on human health and illness has been a major problem in the practical application of cost-
enefit analysis in the past, even in those situations where one can agree on the levels of increased morbidity and mortality
hat might be caused by some policy or project. Efforts to place economic value on the loss of biodiversity have been
qually difficult. Recognizing this problem has led to the development of so-called multicriteria analysis (MCA) tech-
iques. These are expressly designed to deal with multiple objectives, of which economic efficiency may be only one. MCA

More generally, it is increasingly accepted that the pursuit of
sustainable development will require recognition of goals re-
lated to economic efficiency, social equity, and environmental
protection (Munasinghe, 1993). Economic valuation of the im-
pacts of climate change on certain social and environmental as-

The shape of the total cost and benetit curves reflects the
idea of diminishing returns. Each additional unit of emission
reduction will have a higher unit cost: The first LOG reduction
can be done cheaply. but the next 10S will cost considerably
more, and so on.! Thus, the abatement cost curve is upward
sloping as shown in Figure 5.2. Similarly, the marginal benefit

reduced. The consequence of the foregoing is that the total

equal per capita sharing of the burden of greenhouse gas
emission reduction) may have the highest cost, whereas the
worst equity result (indicated by option 5, say based on the
present distribution of emissions) may have the lowest eco-
nomic cost.’ Nevertheless, even MCA requires a quantifi-
cation or at least an ordinal ranking of the noneconomic
efficiency criteria, as suggested in the figure. However, even
such a noncardinal ranking may prove problematic when a
global issue like climate change requires comparisons across
countries and cultures.*

"The foregoing analysis ignores many complications. For
example, the emission of a unit of CO, may give rise toa
varying stream of environmental costs that must be dis-
counted to yield a present value aggregate. The environmental
damage function may be discontinuous and nonconvex. Be-
cause of technological progress, abatement costs may change
over time, depending on when the technologies are applied.
Similarly, abatement costs may exhibit economies of scale
(e.g., mass production of solar photovoltaic cells), resulting in
a marginal cost curve that actually declines beyond a certain
point. Finally, the abatement costs are net costs, to the extent
that certain technologies (e.g., renewables) may produce other
(nonclimate-related) benefits and costs — the so-called joint
products complication (discussed below).

causes of climate change is much more difficult than in the
case of other important regional/global pollution issues (such
as CFCs or nuclear wastes). Indeed, the calculus of CBA may
be significantly affected by natural events such as major vol-

Finally, to estimate the damage costs, one must be able to
value these effects (link 5). Some valuation tasks will be rela-
tively straightforward: For example, the cost of engineering
structures to protect against sea level rise is relatively easy to
establish, given the existing experience in this field (in such
countries as the Netherlands). Other calculations will be more
complex, but at least tractable, as, for example, the calculation
of increased cooling and decreased heating costs or the impact
on electricity demand of increased irrigation pumping re-
quirements associated with drier climates in some regions.

The subsequent link (3). between temperature increase and
physical effects such as sea level rise, involves many different
components, all of which are somewhat difficult to calculate.
For example, calculating the rise in sea level associated with
increases in mean sea temperature proves to be far from sim-
ple in some cases (as noted in Volume | in the case of the West
Antarctic ice sheet). There are also large time lags associated
with sea level rise, which are likely to continue for several
centuries after the concentration of greenhouse gases has been
stabilized. Even more complicated are estimates of how pre-
cipitation patterns might change, especially the spatial and
temporal distribution of rainfall. Perhaps of even greater con-

Once the impact of current emissions of a greenhouse gas
on future atmospheric concentrations has been calculated, one
can in principle calculate the effect of the increase in current
emissions on future climate development. If one has specified
a function which measures the monetary cost of climate

To calculate the marginal environmental cost of increased
current emissions of a greenhouse gas, one must first calculate
the physical impact of such an emission increase on the future
atmospheric concentration of the gas. This will depend on the
physical characteristics of the gas, which affect how rapidly an
increased atmospheric concentration depreciates. There are
large differences between different greenhouse gases, with
atmospheric lifetimes varying from roughly fifteen years for

actual impact data are scarce, and estimates of physical im-

in fact occur, will the impacts be known. The evidence of

Inertia and irreversibility. Since emissions of greenhouse
gases in any one year represent a relatively small fraction of
the total global stock, the system has great inertia. This means
that even if all emissions went to zero, it would be decades. if
not centuries. before the stock of greenhouse gases was re-
duced significantly. Therefore. decisions about emission lev-

It is clear from the description above that the marginal
monetary cost of greenhouse gas emissions is a complex con-
cept. Several assumptions of an economic nature must be
made, such as the appropriate discount rate and the monetary
costs of climate change for the whole future. In particular, the
relative importance of different greenhouse gases is much
more complex than is implied by a simple physical conver-
sion index such as the global warming potential (GWP) dis-
cussed in Volume | of this report. In the context of the climate
problem, a reasonable definition of the importance of a green-
house gas relative to, say, CO,, is the marginal environmental
cost of current emissions of this gas relative to the corre-
sponding marginal cost of CO,. It follows from the discussion
above that the relative importance of greenhouse gases de-
pends on a number of economic assumptions that must be
made. !¢

Geographical distribution of impacts. Poorer nations are
likely to be the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate
change, since they lack the resources to protect themselves
against sea level rise, extreme weather events, or desertifi-
cation. In contrast. the impacts of acid rain from emissions
in some poorer countries or regions may be concentrated in
richer countries!® (e.g., the effects of emissions from Eastem
Europe on western Germany!?). These richer areas therefore
have powerful incentives to promote emission reduction pro-
grammes in the source areas, including the provision of finan-
cial assistance.”” However, in the case of greenhouse gas
emission reductions. countries such as the U.S. (where there
is the perception that the direct impacts of climate change on
the U.S. itself are relatively small) may have fewer obvious
economic incentives to reduce emissions.?! Considerations of
humanitarian solidarity and equity alone are unlikely to be
sufficient motivators.

arbitrary level of emission reduction at P has a very high prob-

What is interesting in these (and other studies*5) is the
significance of “below the line” options (i.e., where MAC is
negative but still upward sloping). These are measures that ap-
pear to have negative costs associated with them — in other
words, when these options are implemented, both costs and
emissions go down, relative to the reference case.2* Compact
fluorescent lighting. other energy-efficient devices. and
demand-side management measures typically fall into this
category, and in developing countries, measures such as re-
ducing electricity transmission and distribution losses or insti-
tuting vehicle maintenance programmes also appear here.
These, then, are measures that should be implemented in any
least-cost energy development strategy. even in the absence of
any desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The fact that
they are not implemented reflects either market failures, the
influence of powerful vested interests, or other factors, such
as high transaction costs (which might exceed the potential
benefits).2?7 Indeed, in developing countries, there may be
more such “below the line” options because education and tn-
formation about the availability and benefits of options in this
segment of the MAC curve are less available than in devel-
oped countries.

Equally important are the concerns over the extent to
which conventional measurements of GDP growth take into
account the depletion of natural resources (“green account-
ing”). For many developing countries this is a particularly
important issue, and there is a growing literature suggesting
that conventional accounting substantially overstates GDP
growth, The corollary is that estimates of GDP impacts of cli-

which natural resources are depleted, or changes in environ-

Since GDP is an imperfect measure of social welfare, it
should not be surprising that the cost-effectiveness of policy
options can differ significantly when analyzed in terms of
their impact on GDP and on social welfare. Recent studies
have found this to be the case for industrialized countries such
as Norway (Alfsen et al., 1992) as well as for developing
countries such as Sri Lanka (Meier et al., 1993; see Table 5.1).
The “consumer impact” is an estimate of the impact or social
welfare not reflected in traditional GDP measures. At 10-50%
of the total, the consumer impact is clearly a significant frac-
tion of social welfare.

qualitative in nature) and there is an urgent need for more
quantitative estimates. According to a recent GEF survey of

Some of these problems are evident from the numerical es-
timates. In Figure 5.6 we display the results of recent studies of
the impact of emission reduction strategies on loss of GDP.*
As is evident, these estimates show considerable variation.
Even so, none of these estimates reflects “green accounting” or
any margin for no-regrets options, and only one (Glomsrod e!
al, 1990) takes into account joint products. Most of these stud
ies are national studies. Many researchers argue that unilateral
actions by the U.S. or by OECD countries are likely to be less
effective than global action, and that unilateral actions are
likely to exaggerate the impact on GDP.*9 However, these stud-
ies also neglect the benefits of the development of advanced
technologies in the market economies, which could then he

"A number of estimates (see, for example, Nordhaus,
1994b) suggest that the economic impact of climate change
on the industrialized countries is quite small. However, Nord-
haus, as well as others, is quick to concede that such results
may not apply to developing countries, where typically much
larger shares of national income are in agriculture, and much
of it in subsistence farming in marginal areas where even
small changes in climate may have devastating effects and
where the ability of the farming population to adapt may be
very small indeed?! The types of human settlements most
vulnerable to climate change are concentrated in developing
countries. including low-income communities, residents of
coastal lowlands and tropical islands (such as coastal
Bangladesh or the Maldives), populations in areas already
significantly affected by desertification, and the urban poor in

Estimates of the importance of joint benefits and costs vary
widely (in part, because valuing the costs and benefits of other
environmental impacts may be subject to similar difficulties of
valuation and scientific uncertainty as greenhouse gas emis-

joint products of carbon reduction (reduction in environmental
damages to forests and lakes, health damages, reduced traffic

Another way of making the same point is by noting that
single-point cost estimates for many technologies can be quite
meaningless, because the supply curve for even an individual
technology is not flat. For example, as Hossein and Sinha
(1993) have shown in a recent study of wind and hydro for In-
dia, the supply curves have the expected classical upward
sloping shape as illustrated in Figure 5.9 for the supply cost of
wind farms in India. Such static cost curves neglect the coun-
terargument that, in a more dynamic analysis, cost may de-
cline due to economies of scale and technological advances.

"However, given uncertainty in the marginal mitigation cost
and damage functions, the optimal emission reduction cannot
be determined precisely. It could lie anywhere within a rela-
tively wide range. Uncertainty in the damage function and
risk aversion lead one to a “precautionary approach,” which
requires more stringent emission reductions, lying to the right
of the expected value Ron and roughly determined by the in-

uncertainty in a different way. Figure 5.10a depicts the cast-
benefit analysis of the optimum level of emission reduction.
The optimal reduction, Roe IS given by the point at which
MB = MC. If the marginal mitigation cost and marginal dam-

uncertain mitigation cost and damage functions, then the opti-

The mirror of the above argument is that some actions may be

The attitude towards risky outcomes is often expressed in
terms of a risk premium, which is the minimum compensation
required to accept a lottery with expected return x compared
to a certain return of x. Such a premium may be required be-
cause the decision maker prefers certain to uncertain out-
comes, but may also occur if the net benefit of his investment
is nonproportionate in quantity. For instance, suppose a coun-
try commits itself to reduce emissions by 100 tonnes and con-
siders two alternative measures. One alternative reduces
emissions by 100 tonnes with certainty. The other measure
has a 50% chance of reducing emissions by 200 tonnes. Even
if the expected reductions are equal (i.e., 100 tonnes), it is ev-
ident that a decision maker will prefer the certain alternative
unless the uncertain alternative is considerably less costly. as
there is a chance of having to impose additional measures if
unlucky. Assessments of the uncertainty involved in the
analysis of climate change may therefore be of great impor-
tance to decision making.

One reason why avoiding climate change may have a value
is that climate change will cause a change in economic activi-
ties. Sea level rise will force people to move. for example, or
more turbulent weather conditions may increase the need to
rebuild damaged structures or replace damaged materials. A
second reason is that people attach subjective values to the
climate where they live — values that are to some extent re-
flected in the notions of “good” and “bad” weather.

Finally, extreme uncertainty might also influence the na-
ture of the economic instruments employed for policy pur-
poses. For example, a price-oriented mechanism (such as a
carbon tax) which limits economic dislocation might be pre-
ferred over a quantity-based mechanism (such as tradable per-
mits) in a situation where there are both uncertain control
costs and an uncertain environmental response (see Lave and
Gruenspecht, 1991).4

"The robustness of a cost-benefit analysis depends critically on
how reliable the values attached to each item are. The prices
of marketable goods and services express social values as
long as the goods in question are not rationed and there are no
externalities.» For nonmarketed goods and services, such as
many environmental services, values have to be estimated in
order to aggregate costs and benefits and obtain an overall
evaluation of choice of policy. Estimated prices may depend
on the methodology chosen to create them, and one should
therefore interpret with caution results which include such

analysis need not reflect the probability of occurrence of the
upper or lower values, it is useful for determining which vari-
ables are most important to the success or failure of a project.
Indeed decision makers often assign probabilities (even if
only implicitly) to the various outcomes. Admittedly, the
sheer magnitude of the costs of catastrophic climate change

Valuation of environmental effects in CBA may be helpful
in atlaining cost-effective decisions. However, the valuation
should be based on a reasonably well-founded methodology.
Speculative assumptions will not contribute to decision mak-
ing. A measure that yields negative net benefits according to
an analysis may be worthwhile if effects that are assumed to
be positive but not explicitly valued in the calculation are well
documented. Decision makers will normally manage to con-
sider more than one measure simultaneously. CBA usually
simplifies the decision by aggregating several effects, but
there is no necessity for all effects to be aggregated into one
single measure.

© Mitigation actions taken before the actual impacts aie
observed. These are primarily a matter of reducing
emissions or of removing greenhouse gases through
reforestation. The vast majority of the applications of
cost-benefit analysis have addressed the question of
how best to achieve given levels of emission reduction.
Valuation issues generally do not arise in this category.

* Costs of mitigation actions taken after impacts become
apparent. These will necessarily occur in the future, and
would be undertaken only if (1) climate change actually
does occur and (2) climate change does indeed result in
specific impacts. The cost of dikes to prevent inunda-
tion of coastal areas is a typical example in this cate-
gory. Based on actual experience (such as in the
Netherlands), the cost of such mitigation actions are
relatively easy to establish.“ Climatic engineering op-
tions, such as painting roads and roofs white or puting
particles into the stratosphere also fall into this cate-
gory. Again, there are few valuation issues here.

¢ Costs (and benefits) of adaptation. Society will adapt
with varying degrees of pain to many of the impacts of
climate change — indeed, society has already adapted to
changes in climate that have occurred in the past. For
example, climate change will affect crop yields and may
result in poleward shifts in the distribution of cultivated
land. Some areas will gain, and some will lose. and the
consequences become an equity issue (between regions
and countries) as much as a cost issue. Estimates of net
losses for U.S. agriculture, for example, suggest a toler
able impact for the U.S. as a whole, but significant re-
gional variations.57 Some of the costs of adaptation will
vary, depending on ex ante actions (e.g., the develop-
ment of drought- or saline-resistant crops).58

In applying these concepts to the climate change problem. there are many key differences. First. in one sense the problem
is exactly opposite to that faced by, say, the power sector. In climate change, one loses flexibility if one does not make short-
erm investments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, investment in reductions now is not free: Resources have to
be diverted from other uses, and better emission technologies may be available in the future. Thus to some extent, commit-
ting now to current technology restricts the option to use better technology later. Second, unlike the financial and commod-
ity context, there is no marketplace to set the value of the option.?

"n conventional CBA analysis, the usual decision rule is to take some action if the expected benefits exceed the expected
osts. Depending on the degree of irreversibility present, 2 more appropriate rule is to take the action when benefits exceed
‘osts by an amount at least equal to the value of the forgone option. Suppose some investment depends on some assumptions
hat are subject to great uncertainty — such as future world oil prices. If one makes an investment decision that is largely ir-
eversible — such as building a large hydroelectric power project — then one loses the flexibility associated with waiting to
earn more about the factors that affect oil prices. Preserving that flexibility has some economic value, namely the so-called
ption value. In financial and commodity markets such options to buy (and sell) are traded, with option prices determined
yy the market itself. But option value theory is now being applied to other fields involving capital-intensive investments,

Among the early attempts at applying decision analysis to the climate change problem are those of Manne and Richels,? whe
have developed an approach for determining the optimal hedging strategy. The paradigm they use is that of a portfolio of in-
surance options:+ What combination of insurance should be bought, if indeed any at all? What portion goes to R&D to re-
solve scientific uncertainties? What portion goes to the development of new supply and conservation technologies to reduce
abatement costs? And what portion goes to immediate abatement of emissions? In particular, they focus on the value of in-
formations and on how much accuracy is needed in climate modelling and impact assessment. Clearly, with perfect informa-
tion, the best course of action can be charted immediately, and there is no need to hedge bets. Manne and Richels conclude
that the need for precautionary near-term emission reductions is inversely related to the sustained commitment to R&D to
develop better climate information (which reduces the need to hedge against an uncertain and potentially hostile future)
However, given the inherent predictive uncertainty of climate change (and in particular the reliability of indicators), the lim-
itations of such approaches need to be recognized.

The discount rate denotes the social opportunity cost of
capital. It reflects the net impact on total social benefits if one
unit of present outputis withdrawn from consumption and in-
stead is invested elsewhere (for instance, in production or
abatement). The criterion for optimal social and economic de-
velopment is that the marginal total benefits from the different
investments should be equal regardless of what the invest-
ments are aiming at. In other words, the social discount rate
should be equal for all investments. [f not, it would be possi-

not sufficient merely to adjust this discount rate to take full

even in “discounted terms”: A 5% increase in the price of the
environment will fully counteract the effect of a 5% discount
rate.

To conclude, discounting is necessary in order to compare
costs and benefits at different time periods. Attempts to avoid
discounting or to apply a different discount rate for climate
measures than for other investments will inevitably result in
an inefficient policy. However, it is difficult to pick out the
correct social discount rate, as there are no practical observa-
tions of such a rate. Furthermore, discount rates may depend
on the future scenario that is assumed, and could vary over
time — in particular, very long-term discount rates may be
lower as economic growth rates saturate and decline (see
Munasinghe. 1993).

"      

The second principle is that a discount rate is applied to fu-
ture costs und benefits to yicld their present values. The issue
of choosing an appropriate discount rate has been discussed in
the context of general CBA for many years (Dasgupta ef al.,
1972; Harberger, 1976; Little and Mirrlees, 1974; Sen, 1967).
The long-term perspective required for sustainable develop-
ment suggests that the discount rate might play a critical role
in intertemporal decisions concerning the use of environmen-
tal resources (Arrow, 1982), We briefly discuss below several
key issues relating to discount rates. The topic is dealt with
more fully in Chapter 4.

The discount rate also provides a signal to decision makers
who evaluate single projects or measures to take decisions in
accordance with dynamic efficiency (over time). Even if one
accepts the requirement to apply the same discount rate for
marginal projects within a given time period, there are many
potential optimal levels of the discount rate. This leve! de-
pends, inter alia, on the social preferences about present ver-
sus future consumption that may be reflected in an inter-
temporal welfare function. The formulation of this function
has been the subject of an extended debate in which questions
about intertemporal comparisons as well as the current distri-
bution of welfare have been raised.

and would require significant modification and/or careful
interpretation when applied to issues connected with global
climate change (e.g., long-term intergenerational impacts,
biodiversity loss, welfare comparisons across cultures or
where there are wide gaps between gainers and losers, etc.).

The question of joint implementation illustrates the limits
of CBA in this regard. The motivation for joint implementa-
tion is a straightforward result of CBA. If a country — say the
US. - decides to make an effort to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions, and if reductions can be obtained at lower costs
abroad, then the U.S. should initiate projects in other coun-
tries to minimize overall costs (Aaheim, 1993). The receiving
country has nothing to lose if the additional cost of such a
joint implementation project is covered by the investing na-
tion. Yet many countries and organizations have reacted with
skepticism to such an approach, for reasons that are political
and based on equity concerns rather than on economic effi-
ciency. The reasons include mistrust of the true willingness of
the industrial countries to mitigate climate change, the belief
that the ultimate reduction in greenhouse gases under such a
regime would be negligible, and the suspicion that joint im-
plementation gives industrial countries an opportunity to “buy
themselves out of their problems” at the expense of the devel-
oping countries. Indeed. some developing countries fear that

A third obstacle is posed by strategic incentives. If some
countries take the lead and set up a greenhouse gas control
agreement, others have an incentive to free-ride and abstain
from joining, as they cannot be excluded from the benefits
such an agreement creates. If countries act selfishly in this
way, few will become party to an agreement. Instead, most
countries will not cooperate, and no general agreement will be
reached even if all countries were to benefit from it. (This is
the well-known prisoner’s dilemma from game theory.®)
Some argue that the overwhelming historical contribution to
the build-up of greenhouse gases from developed countries
constitutes an “environmental debt.” that cannot be conve-
niently ignored using the traditional “sunk cost” approach. If
past contributions to greenhouse gas emissions are considered
from an equity viewpoint, establishment of appropriate side
payment mechanisms from developed to developing coun-
tries, including financial assistance and technology transfer,
could facilitate more enthusiastic cooperation by developing
countries in efforts to mitigate climate change.

Of the criteria listed in Table 5.4, criteria 1, 2, 3,4, 5, and 6
can all be treated by modern decision analysis. Indeed, ques-
tions of timing (urgency), flexibility (or robustness), capital
constraints (“low cost”) are all central clements of the ap-
proach. Also, criterion 13 is really part of 6. (In the text, the
authors of the EPA report amplify the criterion as follows:
“Does the strategy minimize governmental interference with
decisions best made by the private sector?”) Furthermore,
modern valuation techniques permit substantial parts of crite-
ria 9 and 12 to be included in the economic analysis as well.
As conceded by the EPA report (p. 393), “if the principal costs
and benefits can be quantified in monetary terms, economic
theory provides a rigorous procedure for making trade-offs
between present and future costs, and for considering uncer-
tainty, profitability, and most of the other criteria.”

"There is also a need to separate the basic goals of public
policy — such as economic efficiency and equity — which
surely have primacy, from implementation issues such as le-
gal and administrative feasibility, which are generally sec-
ondary. The premise of CBA analysis is that one looks first at
the primary objectives and then asks how many of the primary
objectives one may have to sacrifice to achieve practical
implementation. This principle has become accepted in many
areas of policymaking. For example. the starting point for
setting electric utility rates is to calculate the economically ef-
ficient tariff (based on marginal costs) and then make adjust-
ments to protect low income groups (through lifeline rates,
special provisions for disconnection in the event of nonpay-
ment, etc.). The essence of the approach is not that noneco-
nomic issues are ignored. but that the trade-offs between
economic efficiency and equity (or indeed other objectives not
readily monetized) are explicitly quantified and displayed in
such a manner that decision makers are made aware of how
much of one objective is traded off in the interests of the other.

Another perspective is gained by dividing the solution
space into quadrants with respect to the reference case (Figure

options, which are better than the reference case in both at-

modern CBA (broadly defined) remains the best framework

one might minimize vulnerability to climate change and about insur-

10. Perhaps the simplest and most intuitive example of why the mar-
ginal cost of emission reduction increases with increasing levels of
reduction is the removal of pollutants from wastewater. The first
60% can be easily removed by a settling basin: Large particles sim-
ply settle by gravity, and all that is required is a structure in which
the process can take place. The next 30%. however, requires biologi-
cal treatment. This involves not just a physical structure, but pumps
to aerate the water to promote the growth of aerobic bacteria. The
next 5-6% requires chemical treatment, with high operating costs
arising from the use of chemical agents. Although 100% removal is
theoretically possible, it would require complete distillation, which
is extremely expensive.

as the integrated planning process to achieve it, may be quite com-

timization models, may be “least-cost” only for a very narrow band
of input assumptions; and if these assumptions prove to be different.
then an investment programme predicated on the “least-cost” plan
may ultimately be distinctly nonoptimal.

use the term only where MAC < 0, that is, for those options that are
“below the line"" in the empirical cost curves of the type shown in
Figure 5.5. However, since on both the cost and the benefit side there
will be some netting out (¢.g.. lo account for joint costs and benefits),

27, The fuct that such “no-regrets options” are in fact observed is
much debated. What may be calculated as monetary benefits need
not necessarily be regarded as benefits by decision makers - there
may be other, nonmonetary costs involved. The huge subsidies given
to European agriculture illustrate the point that more than monetary
benefits might affect decisions. In the case of developing countries,
the unavailability of finance may constrain the ability to implement
some of these options. For example. until recently. obtaining finance

62. The theoretically correct measure of WTP is the area under the
Hicksian demand curve, which describes the relationship between
the price and quantity demanded of the environmental resource,
keeping the level of consumer utility intact. Problems of measure-
ment may arise because the commonly estimated demand function is
the Marshallian one, which indicates how demand varies with the
price of an environmental good, while keeping the user’s income
level constant. In practice, it has been shown that the Marshallian
and Hicksian estimates of WTP are in good agreement for a variety
of conditions, and in a few cases the Hicksian function may be de-
rived once the Marshallian demand function has been determined
(Willig. 1976: Braden and Kolstad, 1991). What people are willing
to accept (WTA) in the way of compensation for environmental dam-
age is another measure of economic value that is related to WTP.

sidized prices. Burgess, using the difference between the actual aver-
age cost of electricity and the estimated long-run marginal cost
(LRMC) and applying an assumed long-run price elasticity of -1. es-
timates the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for eleven coun-
tries, including the U.S.. China. India, and some small developing

total carbon emission savings of 124 million tons/year (mtpy) comes
from coal fuel savings, of which India accounts for 11.9 mtpy, China
26.6 mtpy, and the U.S. 85.4 mtpy. Larsen. performing the same
analysis but from the perspective of fuel prices, applies estimated
own- and cross-price ela il fuels to
the difference between an appropriately adjusted border price and the
domestic subsidized fuel price. and, more significantly, includes
the countries of the former USSR and Eastern Europe. In this analy-
sis, the former USSR (917 mtpy) and Poland (105.2 mtpy) dominate
the results; indeed, the combined estimated impact of India (54

Marginal climate change damage is equal to the marginal
climate change benefits of emission control. However, the
benefits of greenhouse gas abatement will not be limited to re-
duced climate change costs alone. A reduction in CO, emis-
sions will often also reduce other environmental problems
related to the combustion of fossil fuels. The size of these so-
called secondary benefits is strongly site dependent. Studies
tor Norway, the UK and some other countries indicate that the
benefits of reduced air pollution could offset between 30%
and 100% of abatement costs.

Monetary values reflecting human preferences can provide
useful information for decision making. The cost-benefit ap-
proach, in particular, requires that the damages from climate
change be represented, as far as possible, in terms of money
units. To the extent that this is possible, the chapter expresses
impacts in these terms; that is, human preferences are ex-
pressed by people’s willingness to pay (WTP) to secure a ben-
efit or their willingness to accept compensation (WTA) for a
cost. Such monetary estimates only measure the impact on in-
dividual welfare. Aggregating individual damages to obtain to-

tal social welfare impacts requires difficult ethical decisions.

"The regional variation in damage is substantial. The avail-
able studies estimate damages for developed countries at
between 1% and 2% of GNP for a 2xCO, climate. Central es-
timates of the damage in different developing regions range
from a minimum of 2% of GNP to a maximum of 9%. For in-
dividual nations, or if alternative assumptions are used about
the value of a statistical life (see Box 6.1), the figure could be
even higher. Small island states and low-lying coastal areas
are especially vulnerable. Most impact work is confined to de-
veloped nations, however. The confidence in estimates for de-

veloping countries is much lower.

Many of the impacts of climate change will not be revealed
directly in the marketplace. These are the so-called nonmarket
impacts. In these cases WTP and/or WTA are measured
through “surrogate markets” or “hypothetical markets.” Surro-
gate markets are real markets in which environmental change
has an influence: A house price or land value may be higher
because of an environmental amenity, for example. Hypothet-
ical markets reflect people’s responses to questions put to
them about their willingness to pay. Monetary estimates are
thus able to cover both market and nonmarket impacts, al-
though estimates of the latter are more controversial and less

confidence is placed in them.

Doubled-CO, damage estimates usually form the basis for
the calculation of marginal damage — the extra damage done by
one extra tonne of carbon emitted. Marginal damage is esti-
mated at $5-$125 per tonne of carbon emitted now. The wide
range reflects variations in model assumptions, as well as the
high sensitivity of figures to the choice of discount rate. Al-
though estimates based on a social rate of time preference
(discount rate) of the order of 5% tend to be about $5-$12, fig-
ures assuming a rate of 2% or less can be almost an order of
magnitude higher, Current models are simplistic and provide
poor representations of dynamic processes. The effect of cli-
mate change adaptation in particular is poorly understood.

The level of sophistication in socioeconomic assessments
of climate change impacts is still rather modest. Damage esti-
mates are tentative and based on a number of simplifying and
often controversial assumptions. Most estimates are for equi-
librium climate change associated with a doubling of the
preindustrial CO,-equivalent concentration of all greenhouse
gases. Best-guess central estimates of global damage, includ-
ing nonmarket impacts, are in the order of 1.5=2.0% of world
GNP for 2xCO, concentrations and equilibrium climate
change. This means that if a doubling of CO, occurred now,
it would impose this much damage on the world economy
now. This chapter stresses the uncertain character of these
estimates. The figures are best-guess results, and several im-
pact categories could not be ed for lack of data. More-
over, the range reflects variations in the best-guess estimates
and cannot be interpreted as a confidence interval. Particu-

Benefits and costs are defined in terms of human prefer-
ences. A benefit is anything that improves an individ-
ual’s well-being; a cost is anything that reduces that
well-being.

Those preferences are expressed in the marketplace by
willingness to pay (WTP) for a benefit and willingness
to accept compensation (WTA) for a cost. Although the
two concepts are not identical and WTP and WTA esti-
mates may vary by more than a factor of two, they ate
often used interchangeably (for a comparison of the we
concepts, see, e.g., Shogren ef al., 1994).

Where markets do not exist — for example, with respect
to ecosystem change — WTP and/or WTA are estimated
through “surrogate markets” or “hypothetical markets”
Surrogate markets are real markets in which envirov-
mental change has an influence: a house price or land
value may be higher because of an environmen
tal amenity, for example (the hedonic property price
method). Hypothetical markets reflect people's te
sponses to questions put to them about their willingness
to pay (the contingent valuation method). Although con-
troversial, these approaches are well established in the
literature (for an introduction and assessment. see, e.g.
Mitchell and Carson, 1989; Braden and Kolstad. 19911
Future generations’ preferences count at least insofar ay
they are assumed to want what current generations
want. If there is evidence that they will want more of the
environmental assets affected by climate change. then
this “rising relative preference” can be accommodated
by cost-benefit approaches by allowing benefits or cost
to rise through time. Future generations’ preferences
may count equally with current generation preferences
if the discount rate is set accordingly (see Chapter 4).
Since WTP is constrained by income, it is likely wly
less for low income groups than for high income groups
This may appear to give rise to unfairness. since th

Since the obligation to avoid harm is absolute, the cost
of avoiding harm is irrelevant: The benefits of control
are so large that inspection of costs is unhelpful. This is
the absolute standards approach.

Harm should be avoided subject to a constraint that
avoiding harm does not itself impose “unacceptable
cost” — the safe minimum standards approach.

"As with the cost-benefit approaches, all the propositions in
the sustainability approach are open to dispute. Controversial
assumptions include the idea that harm can accrue to individ-

There is reasonable evidence to suppose that actions
now in emitting greenhouse gases could cause signifi-
cant damage to future generations, including unborn gen-
erations.

Future generations are defenceless against actions taken
now in the knowledge that those actions may cause
harm.

Current generations are linked to future generations at
the very least through parents to children, from children
to their children, and so on (Howarth, 1992), or, more
generally, current generations have obligations to fu-
ture generations because future generations have rights,
even when those generations are not identifiable and
even when their existence is contingent upon actions
taken now.

Probable improvements in the well-being of future gen-
erations cannot be treated as “compensation” for harm
knowingly inflicted on future generations by current
generations any more than harming the poor now can be
excused by paying them compensation after the event
(Spash, 1994),

Hence, doing harm is not reversible by doing good.

Climate change impacts have many temporal aspects. Firs.
ocean thermal lag causes realized equilibrium warming trom
a given steady-state increase in greenhouse gas concentrations
to be delayed by at least two, and perhaps several. decades
Hence, advantages and disadvantages associated with emis
sions and emission reductions occur immediately. whereas the
impacts of climate change occur only after a significant lag. In
addition, emissions in a given year typically generate a one-
year flow of advantages, but create a stock of climate chinge
that then produces a recurrent annual flow of impacts poten
tially into the indefinite future. Decision making on climate
change thus involves intertemporal issues, of which the ques
tion of discounting may be the most crucial one (see Chapter
2.4. and 5).

The right cost-benefit perspective is one that investi-
gates the benefits and costs of taking actions. Such ac-
tions could yield benefits of a similar order of magni-
tude as the costs of the actions for some time to come,
since avoided climatic damages are not the only benefits
of those actions (Section 6.6). This underlines the dif-
ference between damage estimation and abatement ben-
efits: The latter include the avoided damages estimated
by the former concern, but also include other benefits
from greenhouse gas abatement (see Section 6.7).
Neither sustainability nor “maximizing net benefits” is
an obviously noncontroversial objective. Sustainability
cannot be an overriding objective, independent of the
quality of life that is sustained or the costs of achieving
it. Maximizing net benefits cannot be an overriding ob-
jective, since it may be consistent with an approach that
discriminates against future generations (for example.
by applying an excessive discount rate: see Chapter 4).
This suggests an approach in which the best features of
both approaches are taken: a concern for the well-being
of future generations and acknowledgment of the lim-
ited resources that all societies have at their disposal to
tackle global problems. Such approaches come closest
to the “safe minimum standards” approach: taking a
precautionary approach in favour of the environment,
unless the demonstrated costs of so doing are very high.
Precaution would have its justification in very high
damage costs. Damage costs must therefore be investi-
gated. The acceptability of control costs is dealt with in

Third, the faster climate changes, the greater will be the

Adaptation will, in general, not be costless and may require
extensive planning. The need for integrated and forward-look-
ing coastal zone management has been identified as an essen-
tial prerequisite for the future development of coastal zones
(IPCC, 1994). The significance of adaptation will also depend
on institutional factors. Limited availability of irrigation wa-
ter or of sufficient capital to finance increased input require-
ments (¢.g.. more fertilizer) may limit the scope of agricul-
tural adaptation i in poorer regions (Rosenzweig ef al., 1993).

Conceptually, the costs of climate change impacts in the
presence of costly adaptation consist of two parts: the costs of
adaptation (e.g.. for coastal protection) plus the costs of the
remaining unmitigated damage (e.g., the loss of unprotected
land). The estimates reviewed in Section 6.2 for many cate-
gories of climate change damage also incorporate considera-
tions of adaptation. Damage from sea level rise, for example,
is partly comprised of the cost of building coastal protection
structures. Similarly. the impacts on the electricity sector
caused by climate change amount to costs required or induced
by adaptation (space cooling). A prime exception is loss of

assumption is necessary in order to estimate climate change
damage with existing models. In reality, however, society will
face a changing (rather than a changed) climate. Sections 6.3
and 6.4 present some preliminary findings on nonequilibrium
and long-run aspects. One important implication is that tran-
sient warming may not follow a smooth path between the pre-
sent climate and a future equilibrium climate. Transient
climate change in a particular region cannot, therefore, be as-
sumed to be a steadily rising fraction of equilibrium impact:
instead, there could be discontinuities and reversals. Damage
is likely to be sensitive to such variability. Continual climate

Agricultural studies provide a similar picture. In a case
study of the Missouri-lowa-Nebraska-Kansas (MINK) region,
Easterling ef al. (1993) found that low-cost adaptation mea-
sures, like earlier planting or increased irrigation, could suc-
ceed in reducing agricultural damages to the region by 30% or
more (see also Section 6.2.1). A comparable range was found
by Rosenzweig ef al. (1993) and (using the same yield data)
Reilly ef ai. (1994). In the Rosenzweig et al. study a change
of —1.2 to —7.6% in worldwide cereal production without adap-
tation is reduced to 0 to —5.0% with moderate farm-level adap-
tation and +1.0 to —2.5% with a more comprehensive man-

Fourth, the world is bound to change profoundly even in
the absence of climate change. Sections 6.2 and 6.5 below in-
dicate that the poorer regions are more vulnerable to climate
change than the richer (see Box 6.3 for an overview of rea-
sons). Most of these regions are projected to experience rapid
economic growth in future years (see Chapter 12). This could
mean that their vulnerability to climate change might fall. On
the other hand, human activities cause increasing stress to
many natural and social systems, which could make them
more vulnerable to climate change. At the extreme, climate
change could be “the straw that breaks the camel's back.”
Changes in human prosperity also imply changes in prefer-
ences. Intangible impacts constitute a large part of the total
impacts, and increased economic wealth could well imply
higher human valuation of intangible impacts. In addition,
technological change can profoundly alter the options avail-
able for low-cost adaptation.

"(IPCC, 1996b).

However, the degree of adaptation in developing countries
is likely to be far less than in developed countries due to lack
of financial resources and lack of institutional capacity (for a
discussion of adaptation in developing countries see Jodha,
1989). Where it is feasible, adaptation can potentially be a
very powerful option. In a stylized cost-benefit model of cli-
mate change policies, Hope ef al. (1993) found strongly posi-
tive cost-benefit ratios for an “aggressive adaptive policy” in
Europe, mainly in the form of coastal protection. The benefits
of adaptation exceed the costs by more than a factor of
20. Fankhauser (1994a) calculates that in OECD countries
it could be economic to protect between 50 and 100% of
affected coastlines. In a series of country studies IPCC
(1994) found that, through appropriate adaptation measures,
the number of people at risk from flooding could on average
be reduced by a factor of about 8.

The question of the optimal level of adaptation is strongly
linked to that of optimal mitigation, The most desirable level
of adaptation will depend on the amount of greenhouse gas
abatement undertaken, and vice versa. Abatement and adapta-
tion policies should therefore be carefully coordinated, For
example, if significant abatement can be achieved at reason-
ably low cost, less action may be needed with respect to adap-
tation. Conversely, if the consequences of climate change
could easily and cheaply be accommodated by adaptation,

there would be less need for preventive carbon abatement.

clear. On the one hand, the revised IPCC analysis indicates a
possibility of increased damage associated with variability
and unpredictability, as well as giving greater attention to the

sphere and for mid-continental areas. On the other hand, dam-

However, as the hybrid damage-cum-adaptation nature of
most of the cost estimates suggests, assuming a strict di-
chotomy between abatement and adaptation would be mis-
leading. Indeed, climate change is likely to require both types
of actions. Even with the most ambitious abatement policy,
some climate change seems likely to occur. Conversely, even
the most extensive adaptation strategy is unlikely to fully mit-
igate the adverse impacts of climate change. This is particu-
larly the case if warming is subject to discontinuities and re-
versals. A strategy relying primarily on adaptation rather than
abatement could then have significantly higher costs than im-

The importance of trade Mows is illustrated in a study by
Kane et al. (1992), which uses the U.S. Department of Agri-
culture’s Static World Policy Simulation (SWOPSIM) model
of agricultural trade. Even in a “very adverse” scenario in
which yields fall by 5-40% in most developed countries, the
former Soviet Union, and China, and remain unchanged in
most other developing countries, net global welfare declines
by only 0.47% of GDP. World food prices are expected to in-
crease in the order of 40% or more. with repercussions on
both producer and consumer welfare. In a food exporting
country like the U.S.. for example. consumers are expected to
lose $40 billion annually in consumer surplus (at 1986
prices), whereas U.S. farmers gain $19 billion annually in
producer surplus because price increases more than offset
yield reductions. The implication is that a corresponding loss
of consumer surplus occurs for importing nations, associated
with terms-of-trade gains on U.S. farm exports. The main
loser identified in this particular model run is China. with eco-
nomic losses of more than 5° of GDP. Increased world food
prices also heavily affect consumers in the former Soviet
Union. Ina second, more optimistic scenario, worldwide im-
pacts are practically zero, with negative results in Canada,
Japan, and Europe being offset by gains in Australia. and now
also the former USSR and China. The Kane eral. figures, av-

"Both the original and updated IPCC estimates refer to the
transient rather than the equilibrium impact of sea level rise.
Unlike other damage categories, the equilibrium effects for
sea level rise are far greater and take much longer to occur
than the point estimates corresponding to the first year of
equilibrium warming suggest. For a discrete warming shock,
the sea level continues to rise for up to 500 years (Titus, 1992;
Manabe and Stouffer, 1993: sce also Wigley, 1995). Some
studies crudely convert this growing long-term effect into a
point estimate of a I-m sea level rise for a doubling of CO,,
even though realized increases by 2100 are estimated to be
lower. Others ignore long-term effects and, in a similar arbi-

A study of the Missouri-lowa-Nebraska-Kansas (MINK)
area introduces the further influence of farmer adaptation
(earlier planting, use of longer season varieties, changes in
tillage to conserve water; see Easterling et al., 1993; Rosen-
berg, 1993). Using actual climate conditions of the 1930s as
an analogue for a 2030s climate, the study found that, without
carbon fertilization, climate change cuts agricultural produc-
tion in the area by 17.1%, but only by 12.1% with on-farm adap-
tations, Adaptation thus reduces losses by about one-third. If
100 ppm carbon fertilization is added as an offsetting factor,
output is reduced by only 8.4%. This loss is cut further to
3.3% by adding the influence of adaptation. Considering that
regional temperatures were only about 1°C higher than today
in the 1930s, and adjusting for commensurate carbon fertiliza-
tion, the MINK results suggest losses in the order of 10% for
benchmark 2xCO, warming, even with farmer adaptation.

Another paper emphasizing adaptation is Mendelsohn ef
al. (1993), who argue that the production function method
commonly used in crop models inadequately captures induced
producer responses. They suggest that existing cross-section
data for different climatic regions can provide a better guide
to total effects incorporating these responses. They use county-
level U.S. data to regress farmland values on climate and a
number of other relevant variables. To simulate the overall
impact of climate change on U.S. agriculture, they postulate a
rise of 2.8°C (5°F) in mean temperature and 8% in rainfall.?
Under these assumptions, U.S. agriculture experiences losses
of $6 billion to $8 billion annually if county results are
weighted by shares in cropland area. but gains of $1 billion to
$2 billion if the weights are shares in crop revenue (which
gives much more weight to irrigated lands of the West and
South). The study shows that agricultural land value is
strongly influenced by climate, even after taking adaptation
into account. The cross-sectional data used in the study reflect
agricultural practices that are highly adapted to the local cli-
mate, and yet the authors still find large productivity differ-
ences related to climate. The evidence indicates that warmer
summers have a negative impact on land values and, by impli-
cation, productivity. This is persuasive empirical evidence
that adaptation is unlikely to completely offset the effects of
climate change on agriculture.

could reduce boreal forests by 40% and temperate forests by
1.3% in biomass, but increase tropical forests by 12%. The net

latter impacts, arising from changes in existing forest area. are
assessed in this section. Furthermore, models are mostly con-

Some of the static vegetation models used to estimate poten-

vegetation model, IMAGE 2.0, BIOME, and MAPSS (see
IPCC, 1996b). In spite of the inability of these models to deal
with transient responses, they do provide quantitative esti-

would be coastlines along the Indian Ocean, in the South

time lead to changes in evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and

where precipitation declines or does not rise by enough to
compensate for higher evapotranspiration (from warmer tem-

"The property insurance industry protects other economic sec-
tors from the financial consequences of unexpected or uncer
tain events, including weather extremes. As such, it is highly
exposed to changes in these extremes and thus to climate
change (see Section 6.2.14). The basic function of insurance
is to transfer financial risk from an individual to a group, that
is, to spread a specific individual loss over the entire group of
potentially affected people. At present, natural hazard insur-
ance has a capacity to absorb damages of about $100 billion.
For comparison, in 1992 Hurricane Andrew alone caused eco-
nomic damage of $30 billion, about half of which was insured
(Dlugolecki et al., 1994). The impact of climate change on
other branches of insurance, such as life and liability, and on
the wider financial sector (e.g., banking) are discussed in Vol

Since 1987, after a relatively quiet period of about twenty
years, the insurance industry has been confronted with a large
number of major weather-related catastrophes, that is. events
that involved insured losses of over $1 billion. This increase
was caused by a variety of factors, including population
growth, higher standards of living, concentration of people
and capital in large conurbations, the development of ex-
tremely exposed areas, and environmental changes. Although
there is no clear connection to anthropogenic climate change.
the reaction of the sector is illustrative of what would happen
if climate change were to lead to an increase in the number
and intensity of extreme weather events (Berz and Conrad.
1993; Dlugolecki et al., 1994; IPCC, 1996b; Leggett. 1993)
Premiums were increased and cover was restricted, but
with some delay, as the insurers wanted to make sure that
the increase in risk was permanent. In some areas, such as
the Southeast states of the U.S., the Caribbean. and the
Pacific. insurance and reinsurance supply was withdrawn
after a sequence of hurricanes in the late 1980s and carly
1990s. As a further reaction, the insurance sector has the
following broad options (Dlugolecki ef al., 1994: Tol er at.

mortality rates are found at temperature levels of about 16-
25°C (Kunst ef al, 1993: Haines and Parry, 1993). Climate
change could lead to an increase of heat-related deaths from

occurrence of respiratory diseases (such as emphysema and
asthma), and longer, warmer summers are expected to in-

Tourism and leisure activities. Studies by the Canadian
Climate Program Board suggest that, as a consequence of a
shortened period of snow cover, Quebec could lose 40-70% of
ski days. In Ontario, the shorter skiing season may cause a
loss of up to $50 million in revenue (Canadian Climate Pro-
gram Board, 1988a, b). Losses would presumably be larger in
relative terms in U.S. ski areas, where the temperature base is
already higher. Annual U.S. ski activity amounts to an esti-
mated $5.6 billion and 53 million skier visits (Waters, 1990).
Assuming a 60% reduction from benchmark warming, and
allowing for released productive labour and capital, Cline
(1992a) estimates ski industry losses at $1.7 billion annually.

One problem with the willingness-to-pay approach is that it relies on individuals having an adequate perception of the
risks undertaken. This will not always be the case. particularly in developing countries. Another disadvantage of the WTP
approach is that the resulting figures depend on factors that may be distributed in a way that is not considered just. Most im-
portant, the estimates depend on a person's income. Rich people are better able to afford safety expenditures, whereas
poorer people's WTP may be constrained by their ability to pay. WTP estimates will reflect this discrimination against the

measures include finding out how much people are spending on safety and disease-preventing measures, or by how much |
wages differ between safe and risky jobs (the “hedonic approach”). For example, suppose 100,000 workers are paid an addi- |

Under a prescriptive or normative approach, the VOSL is not set according to observed behaviour but is based on ethical and
political considerations. It poses the question: At how much ought a statistical life be valued according to ethical or other

 

criteria? An obvious implication of this approach is that all lives will be treated equally. Each statistical life saved should
have the same value. However, the question of what this uniform value should be is difficult to answer from a purely pre-
scriptive point of view. In the context of climate change it has been argued that, since the developed countries have caused
the greenhouse problem, OECD VOSLs should be used for all lives under the polluter-pays principle. An example of such
an approach is given by Hohmeyer and Giirtner (1992). Based entirely on a “moral imperative,” the theoretical economic
basis of this approach is weak.

"Attributing a monetary value to a “statistical life” is controversial and raises a number of difficult theoretical and ethical is-

sues. It is important to understand that what is valued is a change in the risk of death, not human life itself. In other words,

the issue is how a person's welfare is affected by an increased mortality risk, not what his or her life is worth. If 100,000 ;
people are exposed to an annual mortality risk of 1:100.000, there will, statistically, be one death incidence per year. Re- ,
moving the risk would thus save one statistical life. Itis this statistical life that has an economic value. It would make no |
sense to ask an individual how much he or she is willing to pay to avoid certain death. Nor is that the context of social deci- |

Aggregation in this context is a political and ethical process, based on rules such as those set out in Chapter 3 (see also Box
6.2). The aggregation process makes it possible to correct for factors not reflected in individual WTP estimates, such as the
injustice in the underlying income distribution or different responsibilities for the climate change problem. The process may
thus result in changes in monetary values based on income levels as they are computed conventionally. For example, if
VOSL is scaled in proportion to income, as suggested above, and aggregation weights are inversely related to income,
weighted VOSLs will effectively be equal across countries, as proposed by the prescriptive school.

damages in presently warm areas and gains in presently cold
areas. Potentially, amenity valuations could be Jarge in ab-
solute terms, because they apply to the entire income base of
the population. However, the tendency towards neutralization
by the differential effects among geographic regions and be-
tween seasons would tend to reduce the overall magnitude of

Economists identify three types of value: direct and indi-
rect use value (¢.g.. plant inputs into medicine and the role of
Mangrove forests in coastal protection): option value (pre-
serving a species to retain the possibility that it may be of eco-
nomic use in the future): and existence value (e.g.. the value
of knowing that there still are blue whales). Table 6.2 (based
on Pearce, 1993) summarizes the results of “contingent valua-
tion” sample survey estimates of what the public would be
willing to pay to preserve an endangered animal species. Av-
erage values range from $1 to STS per person per year for
preservation of an individual species, with a maximum of $40
to $64 obtained for humpback whales. The willingness to pay
figure tor the preservation of entire habitats is somewhat
higher, with a range of S9 to S107 per person and year.

Measures to adapt to natural hazards comprise a mix of
physical, economic, and societal features. At the physical
level, these include building design and protective structures
such as dikes. At the economic level, personal savings and in-
surance help to cover the cost of damage. At the socictal level,
there are social safety nets, charity, and the government. Dif-
ferent adaptation mechanisms exhibit different degrees of
flexibility: An insurance policy is valid for one year: an aver-
age Dutch dike has a lifetime of about two centuries, Flexi-
bility to adapt is enhanced through constant changes in pop-
ulation and industrialization, as well as through changes in the
legal, economic. financial, and social systems (Berz and Con-
rad. 1993; see also Section 6.2.6). In addition. climate itself
constantly changes.

"Along with changes in the mean climate, there will most
likely also be changes in the extremes. Changes in the ex-
treme values of meteorological variables are not necessarily
proportional to changes in the mean (IPCC, 1996b). Also, ex-
tremes are of more importance in studying the socioeconomic
impacts of climate change. Most societies. in accommodating
to the environment they live in, have developed strategies to
cope with only a limited range of climatic events. Within this
range, the “normal” variability is regarded as a resource,
whereas the extremes constitute hazards (Heathcote, 1985).
All kinds of adaptation mechanisms. such as dikes, shelters.
and insurance, exist to deal with these extremes. However,
adaptation requires investment (capital. time. skills) and is,
therefore, limited.

"Monetary estimates of ecosystem damages through climate

Pearce (1993) survey (see Table 6.2) to arrive at a willing-

species and habitat loss from climate change. Total costs
amount to about $40 billion annually for the world as a whole,
with about one-third occurring in developing countries. Cline
(1992a) arrives at an estimate of about $4 billion annually as a
notional value of species loss from benchmark global warm-

an order of magnitude higher ($40 billion). The estimate is

"Tropical cyclones. The impact of climate change on tropi-
cal storms is still unclear. Hansen ef al. (1989) concluded
that climate change would bring “increased intensity” of
“both ordinary thunderstorms and mesoscale tropical storms.”
Wendland (1977) has provided empirical support for the
relationship of hurricanes to ocean surface temperatures.
From monthly data for 1971-81, the frequency of hurricanes
is closely related to the size of ocean area with temperature
over 26.8°C, and the relationship is exponential. Similarly.
Emanuel (1987) argues that tropical cyclones are “particularly
sensilive to sea surface temperature.” and expects a 40-50%
increase in the destructive potential of hurricanes under
2xCO,. Houghton (1994) estimates an increase in both the
frequency and severity of tropical and other storms. Haarsma

much of this rise is attributable to climate change. The results

billion/year. Water supply in general is dealt with in Section

in the section on water pollution (6.2.10). A further impact of
drought is land subsidence. The 1975-76 drought in England
and Wales, for example, led to a cost of £100 million to the in-

amounted to £220 million. Finally, drought has implications

convergence tends to become extrapolated to other regions,

Sundquist (1990) has estimated that there are sufficient
fossil fuel reserves to permit emissions of carbon dioxide to
rise to the point where its atmospheric concentration might
reach 1,600 ppm by the year 2200. After that, the exhaustion
of reserves would reduce emissions and allow concentrations
to plateau through the year 2300 and then moderate back to
about 1,200 ppm over a 400-year period as a consequence of
deep-ocean mixing. With preindustrial concentrations of 280
ppm, this scenario amounts to a potential rise of nearly sixfold
in carbon dioxide concentrations alone. Cline (1992a) uses
a 300-year time horizon to investigate the very long-term
impacts of climate change. On the basis of fossil fuel (pri-
marily coal) reserves estimated by Edmonds and Reilly
(1985), he concludes that as much as 14,000 Gt of car-
bon (GtC) could be available for use at reasonable economic
cost. He applies three leading energy-carbon models (Reilly er
al., 1987; Nordhaus and Yohe, 1983; Manne and Richels.
1992) that project carbon emissions until the year 2100, and
extrapolates their growth rates through to 2275. Average
emissions rise from 7 GtC today to 20 GtC by 2100 and 56
GtC by 2275.

"Cost-benefit analysis assumes that the monetary values of damage can be aggregated across (a) individuals and (b) coun-

simply another word for “welfare” or “well-being.” Basically, introspection allows any one individual to assess his or her
own preferences, but perhaps not others’ preferences. Each individual knows by how much he or she is better off in situation
X compared to situation Y, but he or she cannot assess how this change compares to the extent to which someone else is bet-
ter off for the same change of situation. This inability to assess other minds produces the theorem that it is impossible to
make comparisons of well-being between individuals and hence, by extension, between countries. There are, therefore. end-

less numbers of ways in which individuals’ assessments of their own well-being can be aggregated to yield a measure of so-

Measuring social welfare change requires interpersonal welfare comparisons, comparisons that require ethical judgments
about individuals’ preferences. Such judgments could include one to the effect that preference measures should not be un-
duly influenced by income differences. In this case, the individual measures of preference — willingness to pay — could be
weighted so as to reflect the preference of someone with an average income. One way to proceed is to indicate the outcomes
of the cost-benefit analysis according to differing value judgments about the weights attached to preferences — a kind of
“value sensitivity analysis.” Thus, whether a change in the state of the world raises or lowers social welfare depends on the
impacts on individual welfare as well as on normative criteria for making interpersonal welfare comparisons. Measures oi
social welfare change are, therefore, not objective but normative. See Chapter 3 for a more extensive discussion of ethical

Attempts to quantify long-term damage are rare and highly
speculative. Most often, long-term damage estimates are sim-
ple extrapolations of the 2xCO, equilibrium case, using dif-
ferent assumptions about the degree of nonlinearity in the
damage-temperature relationship. Cline (1992a) uses a rela-
tively modest degree of nonlinearity for most effects, with an
overall damage function exponent of 1.3. Nordhaus (1993a, b)
applies a quadratic damage function in his main scenario,
whereas Peck and Teisberg (1992) consider several specifica-
tions. including quadratic and cubic functions. Table 6.8 re-
ports the central estimates in Cline (1992a) for U.S. damage

", Various factors influence climate change damage (as a fraction of GDP) in less developed countries (LDCs) as opposed to
industrial or developed countries (DCs).

Location. In general, warming is expected to be greater at higher latitudes. Because LDCs tend to be located closer to
the equator, one would expect them to be /ess affected than industrial countries.

Economic structure. On the other hand, LDCs have a much higher share of GDP in agriculture and, therefore, a larger
share of output directly exposed to climatic influences. Consequently, one would expect a greater impact on LDCs
than on DCs from this standpoint.

Coastal vulnerability. Coastal vulnerability to sea level rise and the possibility of an increase in tropical cyclone dam-
age are probably greater in LDCs than DCs. Although vulnerable areas can be found in industrial countries (for ex-
ample, Louisiana in the U.S.), vulnerability is particularly high for such LDCs as Bangladesh, Egypt, and China.
Low-lying island states tend to be LDCs. Of 50 countries or territories identified as having shore protection costs
above 0.5% of GDP annually as a consequence of a 1-m rise in sea level, al] but one (New Zealand) are LDCs (IPCC,
1990b).

Rigidities. Capacity to adapt to climate change may be more limited in developing countries. Adaptation requires an
investment outlay, and low income communities tend to have lower savings rates and less flexibility to undertake
these investments. Thus, Rosenzweig et al. (1993) identify greater relative damage to agriculture in LDCs, partly be-
cause crops are already grown nearer to heat tolerance limits but also because of lesser expected capacity to adapt than
in DCs. A possible consideration in the other direction is that the economy that is growing more rapidly has a lower
fraction of past fixed investment in its total capital stock, and can thus make an easier adjustment.

Human life. Because of poorer nutrition and health infrastructure, proportionate loss of life from climate change (e.g.,
from heat waves, increased hunger risk, and a possible increase in tropical storm damage) seems likely to be greater in
LDCs than in DCs.

Valuation. Monetary damage estimates are based on people’s willingness to pay and thus vary according to people’s
income. People’s appreciation for nonmarket goods like ecosystems, for example, is often assumed to rise more than
proportionately with income. That is. a given ecosystem’s loss affects the welfare of rich people more than that of poor
people. However, in many damage estimates, willingness to pay was assumed to be a constant fraction of income. In-
come differences do not then affect impacts expressed as a fraction of GDP in those estimates.

A “runaway” greenhouse effect refers to the scenario in
which one or more of the positive feedbacks dominate the
negative ones such that the climate changes much more and
much faster than the common consensus indicates. The main
causes are a rapid increase in natural emissions of greenhouse
gases (¢.g.. through methane and carbon dioxide releases
from melting permafrost or methane clathrates), a shutdown
of major greenhouse gas sinks (¢.g.. through reduced plankton
activity or the reduction of growth or dieback of forests). and
changes in atmospheric chemistry.

Most attention will be paid to the catastrophes, as surprises
are, by definition, unknown. Collard (1988) distinguishes be-
tween weakly and strongly catastrophic risks. The former cat-
egory refers to the case in which the product of the likelihood
of an event multiplied by its consequences tends to zero as
events become more and more disastrous: in other words, the
probability of the event declines more rapidly than its impact
grows. A strongly catastrophic risk describes the converse sit-

the probability of its occurrence declines. Which category

best applies to climate change ri unclear (Tol. 1995).

Nordhaus’s (1994a) poll of experts provides the most di-

3C to 6°C almost triples the costs of climate change. The
probability of an impact catastrophe (ie., damages greater
than 25% of GNP) could also be considerable. The average
probability stated in the survey varies between 4.8% and
17.5%, depending on the underlying warming scenario (see

Unfortunately, it is largely beyond the ability of today’s
climate science to quantify catastrophic impacts or their likely
variation with climate change. Hence, only a few attempts
exist. In one example, Tol (1995) splits the damage costs of
climate change, inter alia, into those due to the rate of temper-
ature change and those due to the magnitude of temperature
change. The damage module of his model FUND yields tangi-
ble damages of 0.33%, 0.55%, and 1.09% of gross world
product for a 2.5°C warming in 2095, 2057, and 2031, respec-
tively. However, no figures for a more rapid temperature in-
crease are reported there. The ICAM2 model (Dowlatabadi
and Morgan, 1993) also considers the pace as well as the
amount of warming in the damage cost functions, but explic-
itly adds adaptation. A warming of 8°C at high latitudes and
2.8°C at low latitudes would Icad to tangible losses of 6.0% of

be brought about by strong nonlinearities in the damage
due to climate change, for instance, through rapid deterioria-

of species; rapid spread of vector-borne diseases; collapse of
the financial sector: large-scale migration: and armed con-

An increase in effective accumulated temperature in most
of the country (except parts of Hokkaido) would reduce the
vulnerability of rice to cool summer weather in the north of
Japan, perhaps stabilizing production. Rice-producing regions
may themselves be extended. Commercial rice cultivation in
Japan could shift northward by 200-500 km by the end of the
next century. In the north. 2xCO, conditions could open up
most of the land below 500 m elevation for rice cultivation.
Currently most cultivated areas are at elevations below 200 m.
In light of the altered climate predicted by the GISS model,
the transplanting date of rice would be advanced by 20-30
days and the maturing period would be reduced by 25-50
days. For spring wheat and winter wheat respectively, the
heading date would advance by 2-5 days and 30 days, and the
maturing period would reduce by 3-5 days and 3-6 days. For

Indonesia is the world’s largest archipelagic state, with
nearly 17,000 islands and a shoreline of approximately 81,000
km (ADB, 1994). Sea level rise will affect coastal ecosys-
tems, industrial production, and agriculture alike. In the Kra-
wang and Subang districts, 95% of the predicted reduction in
local rice supply (about 300,000 tonnes) and half of the loss in
maize output is due to the inundation of coastal land. As a
consequence, over 81,000 farmers in the Subang district alone
may lose their source of income. and about 43,000 farm
labourers could lose their jobs (Parry et af, 1991). Under the
baseline assumption of a 15-90 cm sea level rise by 2070, and
assuming that the Indonesian population will stabilize be-
tween 2030 and 2045, ADB (1994) predicts that about 3.3
million people will be displaced. Some 800,000 households
would have to be relocated at a cost of $8 billion. In the ab-

Pernetta (1992) outlines various impacts that SISs may suf-
fer. These include increased frequency of tropical cyclones in
aeas not normally affected by them; an altitudinal shift in
vegetation zones, affecting alpine grasslands in Papua New
Guinea and threatening mid-montane rain forests as they
come under pressure for cultivation: some increased capillar-
ity in limestone soils, reducing soil fertility in some areas;
some increases in disease due to drier conditions in some
countries and longer wet seasons in others; and increases in
humidity and hence human discomfort and adaptation costs.
Sea level rise will also affect agricultural activity, which now
occurs mostly on the coasts, and push it inland onto less suit-
able soils, thus increasing erosion. In addition, exclusive eco-
omic zones based on outlying islands will be affected as
some of the islands disappear under the rising ocean waters.
Protection measures are limited and expensive. For the Mar-
shall Islands, for example, IPCC (1992b) reports that protect-

Secondary benefits from air quality improvements may be
quite large. Table 6.12 provides estimates of benefits from re-
duced air pollution levels as a consequence of carbon abate-
ment (see also Box 6.4). The estimates are not necessarily
comparable since the assumed abatement policies differ from
study to study, although they all roughly aim at stabilizing
CO, emissions at about 1990 levels.

In comparison, Fankhauser (1994b) identifies a lower and
flater trajectory for the shadow price of carbon, rising from
$20 per tonne in the decade 1991-2000 to $28 per tonne by
2021-30, with confidence intervals of $6-$45 and $9-$64 re-
spectively, Fankhauser uses a probabilistic approach to the
range of discount rates, in which low and high discount rates
are given different weights. His sensitivity analysis of the dis-
count rate suggests that moving from high (3%) to low (0%)
discounting could increase marginal costs by a factor of 9.

greenhouse damage differs from the benefits of greenhouse
gas abatement (see Section 6.6). For example, efforts to halt
deforestation to reduce the emission of CO, will contribute to
the conservation of the world’s biological diversity. Other an-
cillary benefits could occur in the form of local and regional
air quality improvements, a reduction in traffic-related exter-
nalities like accidents or congestion, and the reduced risk of
tanker accidents and oil spills. These problems are tied to cli-
mate change in that they are caused by largely the same activ-
ities, in particular. the consumption of fossil fuels. Because
CO,-removal technologies are presently not economical, at-
tempts to limit CO, emissions currently by and large concen-

emissions will therefore also reduce other environmental
problems related to fuel combustion.* These effects are often
called the secondary benefits of carbon abatement.

"Using the base case in DICE, Nordhaus (1993a, b) finds
that the shadow price begins at about $5 per tonne of carbon
in 1995, rises to about $10 by 2025, and reaches $21 by 2095
(at 1990 prices). Peck and Teisberg (1992, 1993a, b) find val-
ues of a similar order of magnitude. Tol’s (1995) alternative
specification of DICE yields shadow prices of $13 for 1995,
tising to $89 for 2095. These model runs assume that parame-
ter values are known with certainty. In the case of DICE,
expected shadow prices more than double once uncertainty
is added to the model. This result arises because of the
skewedness in the damage distribution. which allows for low
probability/high impact events (Nordhaus, 1994b). All three
authors assume a pure rate of time preference (or utility dis-
count rate. see Chapter 4) of 3%. In contrast, Cline (1992b,
1993d) finds significantly higher shadow prices by using a
zero utility discount rate. His reproduction of the DICE model
generates a path of shadow prices beginning at about $45 per
tonne, reaching about $243 by 2100. Other parameter specifi-

cations provide even higher values.

The marginal damage, that is, the extra damage done by
one extra tonne of carbon emitted now, is estimated to be in
the order of $5-$125 per tonne of carbon. The value will rise
for marginal emissions in later periods. The range appear
wide but reflects variations in models, discount rates. and
other factors. The numbers are particularly sensitive to the
choice of the discount rate. Estimates based on a positive sv-
cial rate of time preference (discount rate) of approximatels
5% are usually in the order of about $5-12 per tonne of carbon

"question of secondary benefits from carbon abatement should
also be distinguished from the more comprehensive issue of
the optimal abatement mix with respect to all pollutants. The
secondary benefit argument is characterized by an implicit
primacy of the greenhouse problem, in that improvements in
other areas are seen as welcome side effects of a climate
change policy, but are not considered or sought in their own
right. This is not necessarily the ideal way to proceed. Strictly,
each pollutant should be taxed in proportion to the environ-
mental damage it causes. If there are interdependencies be-
tween them, as is the case with climate change and air pol-
lution, these would have to be reflected in the relative tax
rates. The currently considered abatement strategies may then
no longer constitute the optimal approaches. Once secondary
benefits are taken into account, /ocation will also matter. Al-
though it is not the case for greenhouse gases, for most other
air pollutants it matters where they are emitted. Emission reduc-
tion measures should therefore be concentrated in those places
where the joint benefits of reducing all emissions is highest.

Because reductions in national energy intensities are re-

of the secondary sectors in developing countries may give a
biassed view of their energy efficiency improvement results.
In most industrial countries, in contrast, a trend towards “de-

sector) has favoured lower energy intensities.

With respect to fossil, fuel switching, relatively little infor-
mation about costs is available. although it is recognized that
fossil fuels will remain the dominant energy source for sev-
eral decades yet. Estimates of the costs of switching vary to a
Jarge extent, depending on the type of measure, the fraction of
natural gas lost to the atmosphere from leakage during pro-
duction and distribution. and the opportunity costs of the op-
tion (which depend to a large extent on the availability of, for

The various response options can be assessed in fundamen-
ally different ways. At one extreme is the engincering effi-
ciency approach, which focusses only on costs and how these
are related to internal and external economies of scale and
learning effects. At the other extreme is the welfare economic
approach, which, in addition, considers such welfare aspects
as social, political, or environmental resistance to the option’s
application. Costs associated with the diffusion of technolo-
gies, public education, and lifestyle changes are also taken
into account.

There is a broad consensus in the literature in favour of
efficiency improvement, because it is seen as directly benefi-
cial irrespective of any impact on greenhouse warming and
because it has significant scope for negative net cost (ie..
no-regret) applications, The potential for energy efficiency
improvements in production seems promising, especially in
the power production, transportation, steel and cement pro-
duction, and residential sectors, However, because the end use
phase is the least efficient part of an energy system, improve-
ments in this area would produce the greatest benefits. The
potential for efficiency improvements in the developing coun-
tries is roughly similar in magnitude to that in industrialized
countries. By contrast, energy conservation may be achieved
somewhat more easily in the industrialized countries.

Information about the cost functions of the various mitiga-

time-specific but also region- and context-specific. The weak-
ness of information also relates to the remarkable fact that the
scope for no-regret options seems to be significant, especially
in developing countries. This apparent scope is most likely
due to the high actual time preference rates, lack of inform

means providing the same type and level of energy service
with less total energy (c.g., using more efficient lamps to pro-
vide the desired lighting level). Since energy conservation is
strongly linked to the preferences and behaviour of various
economic agents (such as households, firms, and govern-

Examples of this approach can be found in applications of
the integrated systems approach. For instance, in many devel-

have to depend on outside sources for much of their energy
supply. In addition, many of these agricultural systems are
based on monocultures (e.g., high-yielding varieties of wheat
and rice, which increase soil exhaustion and are more vul-
nerable to massive infestations of pests and disease). Alterna-
lives like low-external-input sustainable agriculture reportedly
lower the need for external and energy-intensive inputs and

costs of the various technologies can be expressed in terms of

As preceding chapters have already noted extensively, a
welfare economic assessment of climate change response op-
tions faces some large practical obstacles, particularly in the
developing countries. First, the policy priorities, especially
with respect to the greenhouse issue, will often differ from
those in industrialized countries. Second, information about
externalities at the local level may not fully reach the public
sector because of limitations in data collection, processing,
and communication: on the other hand, policies dealing with
externalities may fail to reach part of the local population.
Third, most developing countries face a severe lack of institu-
tional and human capacity to deal with these issues.

"In short, the major distinction between the cost assessment
methodology in both approaches is that the engineering effi-
ciency approach basically starts from the evaluation of a proj-
ect from the narrow perspective determined by the project
boundaries, whereas the welfare economic approach attempts
to account fully for the various interests and impacts inside
and outside the societies concerned. including the external ef-
fects and the social and political acceptability of the options.
A welfare economic approach would therefore imply an as-
sessment based on a general equilibrium model, an exercise
conspicuous by its almost total absence in the literature. In
this chapter, therefore, response options are evaluated on the
basis of important opportunity costs and externalities.

Average costs may decrease at a larger scale of applica-

Costs of a given option may decrease when other op-

external effects (external economies of scale).

Costs may decrease as the application time progresses
(learning effects).

Costs may increase at a larger scale of application due
to increasing resistance and bottlenecks related to so-
cial, political, and environmental concerns and to in-
creasing opportunity costs; afforestation projects often
provide a clear example.

Costs may increase because achieving the required rate
of diffusion of technologies, public education, and life-
style changes may become increasingly difficult on a
larger scale; this problem may be particularly relevant if
response technologies require a high level of technical
expertise.

However, if the welfare economic approach is taken, the
overall assessment may be quite different. By using the land
for afforestation purposes, the possibility of using the same
land for agricultural purposes is forgone. It therefore matters a
great deal if the area has agricultural potential or not. If so, the
local population may well be forced to migrate or else to suf-
fer income losses. Moreover, the afforestation programme, if
applied on a large scale, may have additional impacts, either
positive or negative (e.g., through its effect on local climate
and soil fertility, social and cultural life, on infrastructure,
tourism, etc.). Ensuring that such side effects are beneficial
depends on the establishment of effective monitoring and ex-
tension services at the local level. In the assessment, attention
can also be paid to the distorting impact of government mea-
sures. such as subsidies and taxes. on the efficiency of the
forestry option. If all the direct and indirect welfare conse-
quences of the envisaged afforestation programme are going
to be assessed, an extensive and complicated social cost-
benefit type of analysis may well be called for, because not all
aspects can be quantified or monetized (see also Chapter 5).

Acomparable issue is how costs have to be ascribed to the
various reductions that are achieved with the help of the
investment made. More often than not. investments made
for economic and/or environmental reasons have changes in
greenhouse gas emission as a side effect. Many no-regrets
options belong to this category. The question then becomes
how precisely to relate the investment costs to the greenhouse
effect.

If population growth is given and the future levels of GDP
per capita are predetermined, a given CO, emission reduction
target can only be achieved by a reduction in carbon intensity
(CO,/E) and/or energy intensity (E/GDP). The need to reduce
carbon and energy intensities becomes stronger. the higher the
growth rate of population and the more ambitious the targets
set with respect to GDP increase. This relationship obviously
reinforces the need to pay specific attention to developing
countries.

In any case, from the above it is clear that an assessment
based on the engineering efficiency approach alone may eas-

recognize different priorities within countries, the impact of

Historically, carbon and energy intensities in most coun
tries have tended to decline due to ongoing technological
change and evolution. Energy intensity per unit of vale
added has been decreasing at a rate of about 1% per yeur since
the 1860s and at about 2% per year (2.6% in IEA member
countries during 1980-1984) in most Western countries in the
1970s and much of the 1980s (Nakicenovic ef al., 1993.
However, the differences between the various countries a

its direction in the course of time. Moreover, the carbon and
energy intensity in a number of large rapidly growing devel-

logical development (Nakicenovic ef a/., 1993). Also, in cor

Changes in aggregate energy intensity must be viewed
with caution, however, as they depend on how energy use and
economic output are measured. In Brazil, for example, official
figures show overall energy intensity remaining roughly con-

based on its direct energy content and GDP is corrected to re-

by some 40% (Li, Shrestha. and Foell. 1990), and the Repub-

improvements to the energy efficiency of individual produc-

energy efficiency of spatial planning). Only a few studies ex-

focus on energy efficiency measures, which are generally
considered to be the most relevant factor.4 To illustrate, it was
estimated that energy efficiency improvements were responsi-

Indeed, a back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that, if
energy efficiencies of the current structure of the OECD tech-
nologies were disseminated throughout the world, global pri-
mary energy requirements would come down by 17%, from
12 to 10 TWyr/yr. If, instead, the best available technologies
instantaneously replaced the current ones, without altering the
energy system structure, global annual primary energy re-
quirements would decline to 7.2 TWyr/yr (Nakicenovic and
Griibler. 1993), A similar exercise assuming that Japanese in-

Carbon intensity. the other variable in the Kaya identity,
also shows a declining trend globally. From 1860 to the pres-
ent. carbon emissions per unit of primary energy consumed
have come down by about 0.3% per year. or from over 0.8

Clearly, decarbonization can be achieved by a variety of op-
tions, such as fossil fuel switching and using nuclear and re-
newabdle energy as fossil fucl substitutes. However, various
projections with respect to developing countries indicate that,
without serious policies and changing trends, not only will to-

increase faster than GDP because demand for energy services

"The issue of energy conservation and efficiency in the de-
veloping countries differs in some respects from the issue in
industrialized countries. First, a substantial part of the de-
mand for energy is often met from renewable energy sources
like biomass. This is likely to remain so in the short to the
medium run, and there are estimates to show that the scope for
conservation of biomass is enormous in these countries. One
reason is that cooking with traditional biomass fuels is techni-
cally very inefficient. although not necessarily from a socio-
economic perspective (U.S. Congress, 1992). Second, energy
efficiency in industrial activities generally showed little or no
improvement (Imran and Barnes, 1990). Third, the demand
for electricily is growing at a rate that is often hard to keep up
with. There are developing countries that have allocated a
quarter to a third of public investment to generation of power,
and even this is sometimes inadequate to mect the growing
demand (World Bank. 1993). However, due to the presently low
level of energy efficiency in the developing countries and the
consequently large scope for improvement, the potentials for
energy saving in these countries are considered somewhat
similar in magnitude to those in industrialized countries at
present. notwithstanding adverse factors such as the fast
erowth in commercial energy use and the increasing weight of
the industrial sectors (Ewing. 1985: Levine ef al, 1991: U.S.
Congress, 1992). Finally. the the energy market in developing
countries is often distorted by energy pricing policies.

"As a general remark with respect to the above, it should be
noted that a high implicit discount rate does not mean that
substantial energy efficiency improvements and consequent
benefits for the economy are not possible. Rather it suggests
that significant policy intervention will be required to achieve
such improvements. For example. in spite of a high implicit
discount rate, the average energy efficiency of new refrigera-
tors sold in the U.S. nearly tripled between 1972 and 1993.
This large and steady improvement was due primarily to the
adoption of minimum efficiency standards, first at the state
level and then at the national level (Geller and Nadel. 1994).

Thus, it is clear that the scope estimated for no-regrets op-
tions is crucially dependent on the discount factor employed.
If one were to use an interest rate (whether based on market or
normative considerations) that was considerably lower than that
applied by the actual investor or consumer, a no-regrets option
would not materialize, even if access to information and the
availability of human capacity and financial resources did not
provide any serious bottlenecks, However, the practical situa-
tion, especially at the grassroots level in developing countries
and countries in transition, is such that even the latter condi-
tions are seldom fulfilled.

"Consider, for example, the problem of how to increase
energy efficiency in the consumption of wood fuels in the de-
veloping countries. Here institutional measures and proper
distribution (keeping in view local societal and cultural fac-
tors) are probably quite important. Popularizing energy-
efficient cooking stoves among hundreds of thousands of
households would necessitate efforts at many levels. Suitably
designed credits and, if necessary, subsidies or tax breaks may
help in manufacturing the new stoves in large numbers, but
dissemination may be difficult (Hurst, 1990). Nongovernment
efforts in this area may go a long way towards solving the
problem (Asi aman, 1995).

The choice of a discount rate can affect the overall magni-
tude of energy efficiency improvements that are considered
economical. Meier (1991) argued that by assuming an annual
discount rate of 10% more than a quarter of U.S. electricity
demand for refrigerators could be reduced by cost-efficient
measures: using a 30% rate results in positive costs for all
these measures. Similarly, the Committee on Science, Engi-
neering. and Public Policy (COSEPUP. 1991) has shown how
the percentage savings in electricity, at the point where the
costs of conserved electricity equal the typical operating costs
for an existing U.S. power plant. vary according to the dis-
count rate: Ata 36 rate the electricity saving potential is al-
most 456: ata LOS rate, it is about 306¢; and at a 30% rate, it
is about 20%.

However, renewable technologies are not always sustain-
able in the sense of being socially and environmentally be-
nign. Particularly in the case of large-scale applications in
developing countries, notably of hydropower and biomass,
adverse effects may arise for the local population. Moreover,
adverse environmental side effects may occur, such as smog
from the use of traditional biomass fuels (fuelwood, dung,
and crop residues) or changes in biological habitats and local

that concept. Notable exceptions are large hydro and tradi-

"The following classes of renewable energy resources are
commonly distinguished: solar, wind, hydro, geothermal,
ocean, and traditional and modern biomass.!* To understand the
main factors that underlie the costs and energy potential of re-
newables as a group, a detailed treatment of their diversity is re-
quired.!7 Most of them, with the exception of biomass, are
variable in supply. and some of them (especially traditional
biomass, wind, and solar) are relatively more cost-competitive
with fossil sources when they are produced on a small scale
and near the spot of consumption. These latter aspects make
them a potentially attractive option in remote and under-

"Of the three fossil fuels, natural gas is the least and coal
the most carbon-intensive.” Natural gas also produces mini-
mal sulphur emissions and virtually no airborne particulates
(World Resources Institute, 1994). Therefore, a switch from
coal and/or oi] to natural gas is seen as a response option with
multiple benefits. Current estimates of the natural gas re-
source base, which will likely be revised upwards in the fu-
ture, allow for a massive switch-over for the next century or
so to come. If so, the entailed transition of the current vintage
of energy technology would, as an additional beneficial side
effect, pave the way for a broad diffusion of gas from biomass
or coal gasification, or of hydrogen, a potentially massive re-

newable energy source for later in the next century.!°

"The costs of this fuel stem from retrofitting or replacing the
current vintage of energy technology and, in some cases,
building additional transport grids to connect more remote ur-
ban areas with gas fields. Estimates of the costs of switching,
even without extending the existing networks, depend to a
large extent on the type of measure. For example, switching
building heating from electric to natural gas (improving over-
all efficiency by 60-70%) would, according to Rubin et al.
(1992), yield a net benefit of $90/t1CO, in constant 1989 dol-
lars (assuming a 6% real discount rate). According to the same
source, however, switching coal consumption in industrial
plants to natural gas or oil, where technically feasible, would
involve net direct implementation costs of some $60/tCO, in
constant 1989 dollars.

However, two caveats should be mentioned. First, much of
the attractiveness of natural gas as a less carbon-intensive fos-
sil fuel is lost if a sizable fraction evaporates into the air by
leakage during production and distribution. This is due to the
substantially higher global warming potential of methane
(CH,), which is about 24,5 times that of CO,.""' Estimates of
common current leakage rates range from 0.3% to 4% for dis-
tribution and from 0.13% to 6% for production (Simpson and
Anastasi, 1993).!2 The break-even point, that is, the rate at
which the reduced total warming potential is just offset by
leakage of methane, occurs at 7%? for switching from coal to
gas and at 3% for switching from oil to gas (adopting a global
warming potential index for CH, of 24.5 for a 100-year time
horizon). These figures point to the need for strict control of
leakage rates.'4 Additional questions revolve around what
happens to leakage rates in the case of a large-scale fuel
switch and whether leakage rates of newly built and/or addi-
tional grids (i,e., marginal leakages) can be reduced.

Conversely, what often makes up the main part of a renes-
able’s promise are its large potential and modest price on the
spot relative to the availability and prices of conventional
sources. Moreover, by using local renewables, countries could
reduce their dependence on imported fossil fuels and also re-
duce foreign exchange constraints. In addition, in the case of
biomass, local communities could significantly benefit from
small-scale applications and their net positive side effects. In
this respect, local renewables, like energy efficiency mea-

widely. This variation is mainly due either to (1) the calcula-

discount rate chosen, and the assumed capacity and useful
lifetime are important factors. As for (2), costs are strongly in-

ability of supply as mentioned above but also by the form of

On the basis of the prices in Table 7.6, it has been con-
cluded that hydro, wind, and some solar and biomass tech-

ventional sources. Although many wind and solar power
applications are still subsidized or legislatively supported,
substantial cost reductions are to be expected within the next
few decades.-"" Whether these technologies actually become
competitive, however, will also depend on local conditions
that shape @ renewable’s attractiveness and complementarity

Other aspects relevant to cost behaviour are learning ef-
fects, economies of scale, and the need for immediate storage
or transport of the energy generated (the costs of which are
very difficult to assess with any precision). Immediate storage
or transport needs occur not only when the timing of supply
and demand fail to coincide, as is commonly the case with so-
lar and wind, but even more when sources and points of end
use are far apart. Preferably, generated electricity should be
fed into a linked distribution system of sufficient capacity to
handle its intermittent supply. Different. but equally difficult
to assess, are the problems of location and transportation as-
sociated with storable biofuel.

Barring these limitations, nuclear energy, if evaluated on
the basis of the engineering efficiency approach, can be com-
petitively applied, and in various countries it is. albeit toa
largely different degree. (For comparison with gross costs, se

cause of the long design/construction time (up to 10-15 years!

"Unlike removal options, options that enhance sinks remove
carbon after it has been dispersed into the atmosphere. All
sources seem to agree that much more carbon is stored in soils
than in forests. This would suggest that significant attention
be given to measures that promote soil conservation, reduce
carbon mobilization from soils to air, and increase soil storage
of atmospheric carbon through the action of soil microorgan-
isms. Nevertheless, the main option for enhancing carbon
sinks — except for iron fertilization and weathering rocks,
which are both still in their experimental stage — relates to
forestry measures. Their importance is due to their expected
large storage potential and relatively modest costs. The en-
hancement of forest sinks is also one of the lowest-risk
options and offers substantial positive side effects in the envi-

Just as the potential for forestry measures in enhancing
sinks is probably sizable, so is the contribution of deforesta-
tion to greenhouse gas emissions. After fossil energy-related
activities, deforestation and other land use changes are the
second-largest source of carbon emissions. The net annual
flux of carbon to the atmosphere as a result of land use
changes and deforestation ranged between 0.6 and 2.8 GtC
during the early and probably the rest of the 1980s, compared
with global emissions of slightly less than 6 GtC from burning
of fossil fuels, manufacture of cement, and flaring of natural
gas (Griibler ef al, 1993a: see also Houghton, 1990). The
large amount of uncertainty about the net quantity of carbon
released by deforestation and land use changes relates to the
extent of the area undergoing land use change, the carbon
content of biota and soils in the deforested land, and the dy-
namic release profile of biotic and soil carbon after distur-
bance.

sources, such as steel manufacturing, fertilizer, and power
plants.4 To date, most research effort has been spent on power
plants. For these, two types of recovering technologies exist:?>
those that combine separation of the CO, from the flue gases

"The first six measures sequester carbon by increasing the
standing inventory of biomass or by preventing a decrease
thereof. This amounts to a once-for-all uptake of carbon. In
contrast, the seventh measure aims at continuing to break the
carbon cycle, thereby, in principle. enabling its permanent ap-
plication. This option becomes even more efficient and attrac-
tive if the timber is used to substitute on a large scale for
products such as bricks, concrete. steel, and plastics whose

several times larger. but many factors will determine whether

As for tropical deforestation rates, estimates of these vary
widely among the various sources, partly due to different def-
initions of both tropical forests and deforestation (for a dis-
cussion, see Jepma, 1994). According to FAO (1991), annual
tropical deforestation for the late 1980s amounted to some 17
million ha; other estimates vary between 3 and 20 million ha.
Estimates of global annual biotic carbon fluxes from closed
forests during the late 1980s show an equally large variety.
ranging between 600 MtC (IPCC, 1992) and 2800 MtC (WRI.

The potential for slowing deforestation depends on re-
solving complex problems that are linked to societal

on forest lands and the sale of timber for export earnings
in tropical countries or policy distortions (¢.g.. below-
cost sales of timber on government lands) in industrial-
ized countries.

The potential of the option depends on the amount of
area globally available for some kind of forestry mea-
sure (see also Volume 2, Chapter 24).

"However, in practice all, forestry measures are ultimately
limited: The first six by the area available in competition with
other potential land uses and the seventh by saturation of de-
mand for timber and other long-lived wood products and the
eventual decay of the wood. Therefore, forestry measures,
like removal options, are to be seen as an intermediate re-
sponse policy. In this respeet itis worth mentioning that trees
grown on fairly short rotations (harvested at maximum Mean
Annual Increment) are more effective carbon sinks than trees
that are allowed to mature in old-growth forests. This fact has
large implications, especially for developing countries, where
by far the largest demand for wood is for fuelwood and small
construction Poles that can beg grown on short rotations.

"With respect to the first of these uncertainties. there isa
near consensus in the literature that most deforestation in
tropical countries occurs because standing forests are con-
verted to crop and pasture land. This happens because those
encroaching on the forests consider them to have lower eco-
nomic value than crop and pasture land. The potential for
slowing deforestation is therefore hard to estimate. Furlher
more, slowing deforestation requires the application of ef
fective solutions to highly politicized problems such a
inequitable land distribution and lack of secure land tenure. It
also requires effective means of increasing the per hectare
productivity of crops and livestock. The solutions to these
problems are partly technical but mostly economic in nature
and include improved price structures for farmers (e.g.. higher
crop and livestock prices versus lower prices for inputs such
as fertilizer) and better access to markets.

Even if afforestation with sustainable exploitation offers a
net positive return, many other factors may still form an obsta-
cle to its implementation. Actual experience has made abun-
dantly clear that. even if environmental quality and economic
productivity in a certain area are both low, those who use the
land may still be unwilling to convert it to forest. Some even
argue that for at least a decade social, political, and infrastruc-

If. for instance, the forest can be harvested through the ex-

come negative. In that case, afforestation would become a no-
regrets option, and initiatives could allow the payback period
to be left to the market. However, not all externalities can be
incorporated in the prices of the timber and nontimber prod-

also contribute to productive losses by shading adjacent field
crops or competing with them for water).

would be left alone to mature (the so-called carbon cemetery

only rough estimates exist for the carbon content of biomass
and soils in disturbed areas. Estimates of average annual car-
bon uptake vary considerably, depending on, among other
factors. plantation age (for a correlation, see Cannell, 1982),
timber species, soil/climate conditions, and management prac-
tices (see also Houghton. 1991). However, most estimates are
inthe likely range of 1-8 tC/ha/yr. Cumulative carbon uptake
would as a maximum be somewhere between 100 and 150

ment and treatment practices to facilitate methane (biogas)
collection. This biogas can be used directly for on-farm en-
ergy or to generate electricity for on-farm use or for sale. The
other products of anaerobic digestion, contained in the slurry
effluent, can be used as animal feed and aquaculture supple-

environmental and human health problems associated with
manure management. Current reduction options can reduce

When talking about adaptation, the central questions relate
to (1) what impacts to adapt to, (2) how to adapt, and (3) when
to adapt. In this section only the first two questions will
be considered; no attention will be given to the aspect of
insurance, which could be viewed as an adaptation option in its
own right (see also Chapter 6). The question of when to adapt
is one of implementing no-regrets adaptation options now
(possibly developing drought-resistant cultivars and tech-
niques) and of weighing the implementation of mitigation op-
tions now against adaptation options in the future. In the
literature hardly any attention has been paid to any possible
trade-off between both types of options. The section concludes
with some remarks on the modelling of adaptation.

carried out (Tol, 1994: Nordhaus, 1993; Cline, 1992a; Fank-
hauser, 1992, 1993, 1994a. and 1994b). The World Coast Con-
ference 1993 (IPCC, 1994) has pointed to the need to in-
legrate responses to long-term threats such as climate change
and associated sea level rise with existing planning and man-
agement efforts to arrive at Integrated Coastal Zone Manage-
ment. On the impacts of changes in river discharges, only
some scattered information is available. As an example. the
discharge of the Rhine in the Netherlands is predicted to fall
by 10-15% due to an assumed temperature increase of 4°C in
the Alpine part of the basin (Kwadijk. 1991, as cited in
Penning-Rowsel] and Fordham, 1994). However, little re-
search has yet been carried out to combine the effects of
changes in precipitation with the effects of temperature rise, A
major conclusion in IPCC (1994) is that it is very difficult to
differentiate between sea level rise and nonclimate-related
factors. such as subsidence and excessive groundwater with-
drawal, which may be equally important determinants in relu-
tive Sea level rise.

By combining various sources of information, Tol estimated

In agriculture various types of technical responses are
available. These include changes in farming strategies and
crop management as well as changes in crop variety, irriga-
tion, fertilizer, and drainage. Some salt-tolerant crops, to give
an example, can be very successfully grown along the shore-
line of coastal deserts when irrigated with ocean water. Global
and regional estimates for different levels of adaptation in
agriculture are presented in Table 7.11.

Short-term responses to recurrent droughts include im-
provements in drought preparedness and focus primarily on
drought relief and drought recovery activities. Drought relief
typically includes supplementary food programmes and pro-
grammes to protect and replenish livestock. Drought recovery
entails such activities as the provision of seed and land pre-
paration supplements to farmers after a period of drought.
However, even for these short-term responses no systematic
studies have been carried out.

water resource management will become crucial because of
large changes in rainfall regimes, an improved and more envi-

e Capacity building, in both industrialized and develop-
ing countries, to educate people in the former about the
effects of their activities on carbon-trapping biota and
people in the latter about responses to the effects of nat-
ural climatic variability and of potential future climate
changes.

“e Changes in land use allocation, including developing
the potential of tropical plant species. Since most of the
world’s plant food comes from only 20 species, the po-
tential of the vast majority of plant species is still to be
developed.

¢ Improvements in food security policies and reduction of
postharvest losses. Given that postharvest losses — due
to deficient systems of storage and transport — amount
in many developing countries to 50% of production, or
more, major scope for improvement does seem to exist.

e Conversion to “controlled environment agriculture.”
Massive introduction of integrated “controlled environ-
ment agriculture” in developing countries might easily
require an investment of several tens of billion of dol-
lars. or billions of dollars per annum if introduced over
some decades.

 

 

e Aquaculture. Climate change affects ocean circulation
in the upper layers, upwelling, and ice extent, all of
which affect marine biological production and, hence,
marine fisheries. One way to adapt is to intensify efforts
to develop aquaculture. Integrating aquaculture with
“controlled environment agriculture” has a great poten-
tial, given recent dramatic advances in marine biotech-
nology. The almost sterile, nutrient-rich bottom water
from Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) sys-
tems holds considerable promise as a culture medium
for kelp. abalone, oysters, and a range of fish species.

Two important problems can be mentioned with respect to
the modelling of adaptation. The first of these includes the
general set of greenhouse assessment problems, such as the
handling of time, uncertainty, and discount rate. The second is
specific to adaptation and involves the valuation of intangi-
bles, such as wetlands and species. A valuation in dollars per
person for protecting threatened species, for example, cannot
be compared with a valuation in dollars per kilometre for pro-
tecting threatened coasts.

"A major part of the literature on response options focusses on
the various technologies and their cost-effectiveness within a
specific option. The options themselves, however, are not
assessed on the basis of broader comparisons. The main ex-
planation for this “partial” approach is probably the limited
availability of reliable and accepted data about the options’
costs and benefits. Moreover, one increasingly recognizes that
the costs of the various options critically depend on the as-
sumptions employed about the efficiency of the baseline sce-
nario used in the analysis (see also Chapters 8 and 9).

The top-down studies also indicate that in the optimal case
all options must be applied at the same time and in all regions,
albeit to different degrees. The largest potential in overall
emission reduction at current cost estimates seems to be in
forestry (especially in developing countries) and energy
conservation and efficiency improvement (especially in the
OECD and Eastern Europe). Renewable energy (particularly
in developing countries) and fuel switching (especially in
Eastern Europe if methane leakages can be limited) are also
important. though to a lesser extent. Needless to say, the opti-
mal mix may easily change as a result of future technological
progress.

The need for an integrating approach is reinforced by the
fact that many of the options’ cost functions appear to show
internal diseconomies of scale (for some evidence with re-
spect to forestry options see. e.g.. Moulton and Richards.
1990: Adams et af, 1993: Parks and Hardie, 1992: and
Qureshi and Sherer. 1994: with respect to energy technolo-
gies, see. for example, Kram, 1994b, and Southern Centre/
Risdé, 1993: for a broader analysis, see, c.g.. TNO, 1992).
The implication is, therefore, that. afler reaching a certain
scale of application, the most efficient option will become
more costly than another option, and this. in turn, may eventu-
ally become more costly than yet another option. The discus-
sion of the marginal costs of CO, abatement in Chapters 8 and
9is relevant in this respect.

"However, a number of other considerations may affect
these conclusions. Often the various sources are not com-
pletely clear as to the degree to which opportunity costs, so-
cial and institutional barriers, and other environmental side
effects have been included in the cost functions employed.
Furthermore, as was explained in Section 7.3, cost functions
may differ depending on whether they have been designed ac-
cording to the engineering efficiency approach or the welfare
economic approach. These differences will obviously have a
song impact on the outcome of integrated assessments. To
the extent that welfare considerations will cause cost func-
tions to shift upward (especially for countries in transition and
developing countries) in comparison with those calculated on
the basis of engineering efficiency, the anticipated scope for
joint action may be reduced.

"A truly generic assessment, however, requires an integrat-
ing framework that allows a simultaneous evaluation of the
various technologies. If emission reduction targets are to be
achieved in an optimal way, not only economically but also in
terms of flexibility and spreading of risks. a full picture of all
the alternatives should be available. so an integrated portfolio
of options can be determined that minimizes the costs of a
given level of carbon reduction. (The integrating approach in
this chapter should not be confused with the integration of
costs of a given option. or with the integrated modelling ap-
proach treated elsewhere in this report.) One option, drawing
on economics, is to apply a cost-benefit or cost-elfectiveness
criterion for decision making. That approach is highlighted
here. Other approaches to decision making are also possible.
One could rely. for example, on the concept of safe minimum
standards (which may be particularly important in evaluating
investments in nuclear power plants).

(energy saving and efficiency) and category 3 (clean fossil technolo-

technologies and both change the energy conversion process to the
extent of violating the definition for the energy saving and efficiency
category. However, ultimately no clear distinction can be made as
modifications in the energy conversion process become minor (due

to further technological progress).

It may seem that, although the above categories are conceptually
tinet. in real life they are not strictly mutually exclusive: that is.
measures are conceivable that can be classified in more than one cat-
egory. An example would be the plantation of forests or biomass
used for energy purposes. These measures seem to fall into both cat-
egory 3 (renewable energy) and category 6 (enhancing carbon sinks).
However, this is not the case. The measures are an example of how
easily markedly different processes that underlie the measures can be
confused.

 

 

      
"	Text
" 

In the case of forests, broadly three types of measures are con-
ceivable to fix carbon: (1) to afforest new lands to let the forest sim-
ply mature; (2) to plant forest and sequester the timber derived from
it: and (3) to use the wood for energy purposes on a sustainable basis.
thereby avoiding the alternative use of fossi] fuels. In the following.
(1) and (2) are discussed in Section 7.4.6 (forestry options). whereas
(3) belongs to the renewable/biomass category, With respect to (3). it
should be borne in mind that sometimes a significant amount of addi-
tional energy may be required to turn the biomass into energy. This

. for instance, the case for the production of ethanol from corn.
where additional energy requirements are of the order of the energy
content of the © produced ethanol itself (Swisher ef a/., 1993).

"Moreover, one necessary ingredient for the adoption of
new technology. namely a pool of local skills to draw on, may
be lacking or inadequate in many cases, so that even proven
technologies may spread rather slowly in these countries. For
all these reasons an adequate and timely process of energy ef-
ficiency institution building seems imperative, especially in
developing countries. There is evidence that the existence of
such separate institutions has helped Indonesia, South Korea,
and Thailand, for instance, make greater headway in the scope
and coverage of their energy efficiency policies and pro-

the table were expressed in toe/$1000 PPP (correction
based on UNDP Human Development Report, 1993
data), the energy intensity of the developing countries
would become 0.35 but that of the developed countries
would remain 0.34. However, this would still ignore the
relatively higher energy content of the developing coun-
tries’ imports and the lower energy contents of its ex-
ports. [ff these two factors are taken into account, energy
intensity in the developing countries would be higher
than that in toe/$1000 PPP but probably lower than
that in nominal terms (Ettinger, 1994).

The literature on the adoption and diffusion of technology
clearly indicates that while profitability is probably the most
straightforward determinant of the adoption of a new idea. a
new technology, or new equipment, various other factors may
also be important. A review of recent research into the diffu-
sion of energy technologies in developing countries shows
that there are many financial. institutional, and other factors
that influence the successful adoption of these technologies
(Barnett, 1990; Ghai. 1994). In Africa, for example. social re-
sistance has impeded the diffusion of drought-tolerant crop
varieties, and such resistance could also inhibit the adoption
of new energy technologies. Often the initial awareness of
benefits and new opportunities may be contingent on such

At the same time it is clear that, although the scope for ef-
fectively applying policy options in the developing countries
seems to be significant (for a recent evaluation of various
technical options at the country level. see UNEP, 1994), so are
the obstacles to be encountered. Indeed. the availability of
technical options for higher energy efficiency, to give just one
example, does not guarantee their adoption on a large scale.
There may need to be a significant stimulus to achieve wide-
spread efficiency improvements, particularly in markets char-
acterized by high implicit discount rates. But a combination
of education, financial incentives. and minimum efficiency
standards coupled with freedem from distortionary policies
can effectively transform energy use markets so that large en-
ergy savings and emission reductions are achieved along with
net economic savings (Geller and Nadel, 1994).

"Most scenarios suggest that during the next decades the
growth in carbon emissions will increasingly take place in the
developing countries, According to the data summarized in
Alcamo et al, (1995), the mean world annual growth rate of
CO, emissions for over twenty scenarios is 1.56%, the corre-
sponding mean rate for China is 2.83%, for Eastern Europe
and ex-USSR 0.76%, and lor Africa 3.85%. Consequently, ac-
cording to one of the scenarios in that study, ECS 92 (dynam-
ics as usual), the share of developing countries in global CO,
emissions is projected to reach 46% by 2020 (as compared to
34% tor the OECD and 20% for countries in transition), How-
ever, according to the various World Energy Council (WEC)
scenarios, the developing countries’ share in 2020 would be
over 60%. In any case, it seems most likely that the develop-
ing countries as a group will start to become the major CO,
emitters within a few decades. This picture is reinforced if the
emissions of CH, from wetland rice cultivation and from en-

teric fermentation are also taken inte account.

8. Total global energy consumption amounted to 10 TWyr in 1990,
whereas identified fossil energy reserves are estimated at 1.280
TWyr (Rogner ef al. 1993), Obviously, the use of an aggregate figure
for fossil fuels (mostly coal reserves) should not obscure the fact that
the corresponding time span for the individual fossil fuels differs
widely. The ratio of proven reserves to annual production (R/P) is es-
timated at about 55 years for natural gas, 45 years for oil, and 235

small/medium-seale and large-scale conversion systems. In contrast,
biomass appears to be the most complex of all technologies. A wide
range of conversion technologies exists, depending on the type of

given the state of technology at hand. Finally, the remainder of tech-

prevailing economic constraints (such as a prohibitive level of costs,
institutional constraints in the energy markets, etc.) would pass for
economic potential. Notice that, for the present purpose, the former

models do not address these underlying factors in a ver
effective way. Future analysis should make use of mul
tiple baseline scenarios to help capture the differences i
these factors.

Infrastructure decisions are critical because they can al
low or restrict future options, and different infrastruc
ture decisions can lead to very different cost outcomes
This issue is of particular importance to developing
countries, where major infrastructure decisions will be
made over the next 25 years.

Mitigation costing analyses reveal the costs of mitiga-
tion relative to a given baseline. The results of different
studies cannot easily be compared to each other unless
differences in baselines are taken into account. Neither
the baseline nor the intervention scenarios should be in-
terpreted as representing likely future conditions.

There is growing integration of bottom-up and top-down
analyses of the costs of energy-related greenhouse gas
mitigation. This convergence means that differences in
results are increasingly driven by differences in input as-
sumptions rather than by differences in model structure.
Nevertheless, differences in structure remain important,
since cach type of model is best suited to answer particu-
lar kinds of questions. Models with more detailed rep-
resentation of technology are better suited to identify
technical potentials and financial costs and savings;
models with more detailed representation of broader
economic activity are better suited to identify costs in
terms of higher or lower economic growth.

Substantial disagreement still exists over the existence
and size of a significant no-regrets potential for green-
house gas emission reduction. Bottom-up approaches,
which assume that there exist substantial correctable
market imperfections, show significant no-regrets po-
tential; top-down studies, which assume that existing
markets are relatively efficient, show little no-regrets

potential.
"	List
"¢ It is important to be clear what types of costs (e.g., di-
rect, sectoral, macroeconomic, or welfare) are included
in the analysis. What matters from the point of view of
policy are, not the total costs of emission reduction, but
the net costs (i.e., the total costs minus any positive side
effects of mitigation).

The insights generated by modelling analyses (e.g., the
areas of greatest potential for cost-effective emission re-
duction or the directional effect of tax recycling on
emission reduction costs), not the specific numerical
results of any one analysis, are what matter. Although
researchers attempt to incorporate their best understand-
ing of development processes into the studies, neither
the baseline nor the intervention scenarios should be in-
terpreted as representing likely future conditions, espe-
cially more than a decade into the future.

The size of the costs of mitigation depends critically on
assumptions about the efficiency of the baseline sce-
nario used in the analysis. The higher the underlying
economic growth assumed in the baseline scenario, the
greater the estimated costs of mitigation. The more
emission reduction built into the baseline, the higher the
estimated costs of further reduction.

Whether a no-regrets potential for emission reduction ex-
ists depends on whether the economy under considera-
tion is on or below its theoretical production frontier. The
existence of a no-regrets potential (where the society is
below the frontier) implies, first, that significant market
failures exist that give rise to increased greenhouse gas
emissions and, second, that policies can be designed and
implemented that correct those market failures.
Mitigation costs will be affected by a wide range of fac-
tors, including population growth, consumption patterns,
resource and technology availability, geographical dis-
tribution of activity, land use and transportation patterns,
and trade. As a result, there exists a range of quite differ-
ent socioeconomic and technological development paths
that would give rise to quite different emission scenarios

policymakers and the type of information economic models
can supply. As discussed below, the lessons of modelling

Another difficulty stems from the fact that, in the first
phase, many agencies have employed models not initially de-
signed to shed light on the cost of emission reductions. Exam-
ples would be models with energy sectors so aggregated that it
was impossible to describe a substitution between fossil and
nonfossil energies, or the use of short-term models to simulate
medium-term impacts. Some of these models are no longer in
use; others have evolved through several versions, further
complicating the picture. Thus, some of the apparent diversity
of results is simply due to the development of research itself.

These circumstances have created an opportunity for mis-
using models and their results in public debates. To help avoid
either uncritical acceptance or total distrust of current analy-
ses of mitigation costs, this chapter will present a discussion
of the critical determinants likely to influence the overall cost
of climate policies and of the main methodologies employed
to account for them. The purpose is not to have a detailed com-
parative analysis of the models, but to concentrate on the possi-

of their policy implications. We will examine successively

having to do with integrating cost analyses with analyses of
the benefits of mitigation, or issues having to do with the
costs of adaptation to climate change. Discussions of esti-
mates of benefits (i.e., of the costs of climate change) are
contained in Chapter 6, whereas Chapter 10 on integrated as-

and benefits. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a basis
for a better understanding of the mitigation cost estimates
summarized in Chapter 9. These cost estimates need to be
compared with the estimates of the benefits of mitigation (ic.
the damages or costs of not reducing net emissions) summa-
rized in Chapter 6 in order to provide the basis for an inte-

"¢ First, the focus is on co, emissions, and the other
greenhouse gases are cither ignored or treated sepa-
rately in an ad hog manner. This emphasis has arisen not
only because of the importance of CO, emissions rela-
tive to those of other gases, but also because the long-
term demand and supply models! that energy analysts
had begun to develop by the mid-1970s in response to
the instability of energy markets at that time could also
be used to analyze CO, emissions associated with the
energy system, Such a modelling capability was not
available with respect to other greenhouse gases.

 

  

¢ Second, the structure of the debate was determined very
early by the wide range of numerical results about the
potential for, and costs of, mitigation. Some studies ar-
gued that mitigation policies were likely to entail very
substantial costs (Nordhaus, 1977, 1979), others that the
costs would be relatively small (Edmonds and Reilly,
1983), and still others that these costs might in fact be
negative and bring an overall benefit (Lovins ef al.,

First, we have to recall here a classic distinction in eco-
nomics between marginal costs (e.g., the incremental cost of
removing an additional tonne of carbon or its equivalent), to-
tal costs (the sum of all marginal costs), and average costs (to-
tal cost divided by the quantity removed). Confusion can
easily result from neglecting these distinctions. For example,
the marginal cost of reducing emissions by an additional
tonne may be very high in a given scenario, whereas the total
and average cost of the relevant emissions reduction policy
may be very low or even negative.

Before comparing any results, attention must be given to
the way reduction targets are set, because this affects their
meaning. Some models calculate reduction from a benchmark
date in the recent past; this is the case for most of the U.S.
studies in the energy field and for the studies carried out in the
other OECD countries on how to stabilize greenhouse gas
emissions over the next decade. Others (usually in studies of
developing countries and very often in long-term studies in
Europe) set the target in terms of a percentage reduction from
an emission level at a specified future date. Given expected
growth in baseline emissions in the future, a particular per-
centage reduction from a base year typically implies a much
greater total reduction than the same percentage reduction

from the future baseline scenario.

may yield enough energy cost savings to more than off-
set the costs of adopting and using the technology.
These costs depend on both technico-economic data and
a given interest rate and can be used to construct tech-
nology cost curves of the kind shown in Figure 8.1.
They can be calculated in the absence of any global sce-
nario but they do not then provide a macroeconomic
cost assessment unless they are fed into coherent techni-
cal and economic frameworks. They are the only source
of information available for mitigation measures in sec-
tors for which no comprehensive sectoral model has so
far been developed.

Economic costs for a given sector. Here sectoral models
are used to integrate sets of measures to provide con-
sistent pictures of a given sector, and to compare the
relative costs of different: scenarios. These sectoral
scenarios take some macroeconomic indicators, such as
the overall rate of growth, as input parameters. They
provide what is referred to as “partial equilibrium”
analysis, in the sense that these sectoral models do not
capture the feedback effects between the behaviour of a
sector and that of the overall economy. To date, most
sectoral analyses of mitigation costs have used energy
sector models and forestry models. Other sectoral mod-
els, such as transportation or agriculture models, exist
but have not yet been used so extensively for analysis of
greenhouse gas mitigation.

Macroeconomic costs. These measure the impact of a
given strategy on the level of the gross domestic product
(GDP) and its components (household consumption, in-
vestment, etc.). This aggregate index measures the mon-
etary value added of goods and services produced in a
single year and provides an index of the scale of human
activilies that pass through markets plus. by convention,
the imputed value of some nonmarket activities (such as
the value of services provided by public administra-
tion). At this Jevel of cost analysis one tries to account

In fact, much work remains to be done in attempting to in-
corporate broader conceptions of human welfare (such as
those that are suggested in the United Nations Development

ures provided by current economic modelling studies must
therefore be strictly interpreted as estimates of losses (or
gains) in the value of new final goods and services forgone as
a consequence of the policy, not as estimates of impacts on

The second problem is that it is more difficult, empirically
and theoretically, to pass from GDP costs to welfare costs. In
most empirical models, welfare cost measures are calculated
as the income required to leave a typical household no worse
off after a tax than before. In models devoted to analyzing the
short-term impact of taxation policies, welfare costs are cal-
culated on the basis of the so-called “Harberger triangle.”
which demonstrates that welfare losses grow at a higher rate
than increases in taxes. These results, however, are not com-
plete measures of welfare costs. In the first place, they gener-
ally do not account for the dynamic effects of important
policy measures on technology and consumer preferences. In
the second place, they depend on market product calculations
and do not account for the goods and services produced by
nonmarket and informal economies.

"The first lies in the fact that, in a number of developing
countries and Central and Eastern European countries, the
level of government intervention or market distortion (which
exists also in OECD countries but not to the same degree)
may interfere with the absolute and relative prices of goods
and services. This results in distortions between observed
market prices of technologies and their “shadow prices,” as-
sessed “at factor costs,” which would reflect the actual balance
between human capabilities, technical potentials, natural re-
source scarcity, and final needs within a given economy. The
use of market prices is relevant for assessing the likeliness of
the adoption of some technical alternatives for a given institu-

caused by policies in a given sector (what is commonly
labelled the “general equilibrium” effects, which are
to be distinguished from the partial equilibrium—

Welfare costs. GDP variations do not provide direct
measures of human welfare. There are many reasons for
this. First a climate policy may change the composition
of GDP in the direction of higher investments and lower
consumption. These changes are invisible to an analysis
looking only at the level of GDP. Second, human wel-
fare may not increase linearly with consumption, so
consumption changes do not necessarily indicate com-
mensurate changes in welfare. Third, changes in the
level of GDP do not account for the relationship be-
tween distribution of income and overall welfare. Finally,
environmental degradation reduces welfare but does not
result in a corresponding reduction in GDP. Even GDP,
therefore, does not include all costs of interest, and even
general equilibrium models that attempt to measure wel-
fare costs do not include all costs that matter.

  
"	List
"The four types of costs outlined here represent increasing lev-
els of generality as one moves from direct financial costs to
welfare costs. However, the different levels of cost cannot be
aggregated or correlated in any systematic way. For example.
ranking efficient technologies in terms of their individual
prices in the marketplace (direct engineering and financial
costs) usually does not reveal the way these technologies will
actually be adopted and combined in an economically consis-
tent productive system. For instance, a given energy efficiency
improvement may not be rationally selected if this improve-
ment occurs in a period of time when the electric supply is in
excess. Similarly, a sectoral optimization of a very capital-
intensive sector may not give results consistent with some
form of overall macroeconomic optimum. For example. the
amount of money spent in optimized energy supply or trans-
portation systems may prevent investment in other sectors
such as education and health. On the other hand, aggregate
macroeconomic analysis of costs may not capture important
changes to the extent that these changes remain below the
level of “noise” of analysis and are not captured by historical
variation in the aggregate variables. This typically occurs
with respect to the agricultural sector, which represents a
small part of overall GDP but often plays a decisive role in the
social and spatial equilibrium of a society.

The discussion of “no-regrets” potential has triggered a
sensitive policy debate which can be summarized rather sim-
ply, though rather abstractly, in graphical form (see Figure
8.2). To begin. we represent the whole economy as producing
two sets of goods and services: (1) a composite good Q,
namely an aggregate of all existing goods and services, and
(2) a given level of environmental quality E. represented in
this case by a certain amount of emission reductions. Given
such an assumption, itis possible to construct a curve F(Q,E),
called a theoretical production frontier by economists, which
represents the trade-off between economic activity (Q) and
emission reduction (E). For a given economy at a given time,
each point on this curve shows the maximum size of the econ-
omy for each level of emission reduction: put another way, it
shows the maximum emission reduction for each level of eco-
nomic activity. If the economy is at a size and level of emis-
sion reduction below and to the Ie/t of this curve (e.g., point O
in Figure 8.2), it is possible for that economy to move up-
wards (c.g.. from O to B). producing more goods without in-
creased emissions. or to move to the right (e.g., from O to A),
reducing emissions without reducing the size of the economy,

that markets and institutions do not behave perfectly because
of market failures (lack of information, distorted price sig-

(inadequate regulation, inadequate delineation of property
rights. distortion-inducing fiscal systems, ete.): (2) that it is
possible to identify policies that have the ability to correct
these market and institutional failures without incurring im-

a policy decision is made to eliminate selectively those fail-

The critical question is, then, whether the reference or
baseline scenario to which mitigation scenarios are compared
is on this frontier or not. Assuming that a no-regrets potential
exists suggests implicitly that any baseline scenario is below
the frontier and that appropriate policies would move the
economy up towards that frontier. The counterargument is
that, if such a potential had existed. it would already have
been adopted by the marketplace at least as long as there were
no institutional failures preventing market forces from operat-

that any cost-effective emission reduction is already embod-

From the point of view of cost analysis, a key considera-
tion is what is assumed about the location of the reference or
baseline scenario with respect to this curve. If the baseline
scenario ussumes the economy to be located somewhere on
the theoretical production frontier (curve F), it is clear that
there is a direct and unavoidable trade-off between economic
activity and the level of emissions. In effect, all increases in
emission reduction (moving down the surface of the curve to
the right) will decrease economic activity (i.c., increase
costs). That is, there is no no-regrets potential: Moving up to
the left on the curve will increase economic activity but also
increase emissions. In such a context, an appropriate policy
mix can minimize the net cost of lower emissions but can
never offset it totally.” Conversely, in a baseline scenario that
describes an economy below the production frontier repre-
sented by curve F, no-regret strategies are possible, by mov-
ing from O to any point between A and B on curve F, Under
these conditions, emissions can be reduced without reducing
the size of the economy (.c., without increasing overall costs)
and possibly with some enhancement of economic activity.!?

Theoretically, the recycling of a carbon tax may result in
either an economic double dividend or an added tax burden
(Bovenberg and Van der Mooij, 1994; Goulder, 1994). Rec-
tangle B in the right-hand diagram in Box 8.1 represents the
additional cost of a tax when itis levied on top of existing dis-
torting taxes. In these circumstances, emission taxes would
yield an economic double dividend if the added tax burden
they cause is lower than the decreased tax burden they make
possible by reduced taxes on other factors of production
(labour, capital, rent). Otherwise, emission taxes would in-
crease the costs to the economy.

Much of the discussion about the costs of greenhouse gas
emission reduction — and indeed about energy issues in gen-

of the consumption or production activities that are the coun-

On the other hand, international coordination of mitigation
policies may not only prevent these outcomes but may result
in lowering the total global cost of reducing emissions. To the
extent that mitigation costs vary among countries, the costs of
a given level of global mitigation would be lower if interna-
tional coordination resulted in the most cost-effective mitiga-
tion policies being adopted first than if each country were
simply to reduce emissions by an equal amount.'* Although a
growing theoretical literature is currently devoted to this is-
sue, it has been addressed only in a few empirical modelling
works to date. Most analyses have assumed either that na-
tional polices are adopted unilaterally or that the effects of
national mitigation policies are neutral with respect to in-
ternational competition (i.e., that all countries take the same
action or that the effects of mitigation policies on international
competitiveness are small). So far no model has been able to
account for the gains to be expected from international cooper-

Technological patterns in sectors such as energy, trans-
port, heavy industry, construction, agriculture, and for-
estry. As discussed below, these patterns encompass
individual technological choices and options but also
include overall technological systems, with their partic-
ular internal consistencies and dynamics.

Consumption patterns. For a given per capita income,
parameters such as housing patterns, Icisure styles, or
the durability and the rate of obsolescence of consump-
tion goods will have a critical influence on long-run
emission profiles. Beyond their purely technical as-
pects, these patterns are also related to the level of edu-
cation, distribution of income, and degree of dualism in
an economy.

The geographical distribution of activities, which en-
compasses the distribution of human settlements in a
given territory, climate impacts on energy demand, and
the nature of urban form within a given settlement. The
impact of this parameter is threefold: first on the evolu-
tion of land uses, second on mobility needs and trans-
portation requirements, and third on the energy used for
heating and cooling.

Structural changes in the production system and, in par-
ticular, the role of high or low energy-intensive indus-
tries and services. The energy content of industries such
as steel, nonferrous metals, chemicals, or pulp and pa-
per is between four and six times that of other indus-
tries. At the other end of the spectrum, a simple phone
call on a given commodity futures market can generate
substantial economic gains (and e-mail connections can
increase the efficiency of researchers) for a negligible
energy content. A shift in the relative size of primary
production and service industries in an economy may or
may not affect the overall level of economic activity but
will have significant implications for energy use.

As explained earlier, the mitigation costs attached to each
possible baseline scenario depend not only on the absolute
level of the required mitigation and on the array of available
technologies (energy efficiency, fuel switching, biomass
planting, other renewable energy development, modal choices
in transport) but also on the timing of this mitigation (Grubb
et al, 1994; Hourcade and Chapuis, 1993; Manne and

fact that the bigger the inertia of the production and consump-

To accelerate the replacement of old equipment could be a
major source of the costs of mitigation. But this inertia also
determines the magnitude of the loss of consumer welfare as-

A special case for inertia in development patterns occurs
when such inertia creates irreversible processes of technologi-
cal change. To a large extent such irreversibilities emerge out
of the factors traditionally discussed in the literature on tech-
nical innovation: learning curves, economies of scale, in-
creasing informational returns, positive network externalities.
barriers to entry, and others. Irreversibility occurs when these
factors combine in such a way that a particular trajectory of
technological change and development is created that effec-
tively makes impossible the alternative choices that were
available earlier. This gives rise to a time dependence of tech-
nical choices and the occurrence of “lock-in” effects (Arthur,
1988). Beyond such a bifurcation point, market forces will re-
inforce the first choice in a self-fulfilling process. To give a
single example, given the high research and development
costs involved in a new automobile engine, it is unlikely that re-
search and development risks will be incurred simultaneously
on electric cars, 2L/100 km gasoline engines, and biofuel en-
gines, As with gasoline engines in the early days of the automo-
bile, the choice of a particular technology, beyond a’ certain
point, will essentially prevent the development of alternatives.

An important determinant of greenhouse gas emissions in any
economy is the raw material intensity of that economy: the
amount of matter and energy used per unit of economic activ-
ity. Broadly speaking, for any given level of economic activity,
the lower the raw material intensity, the lower the greenhouse
gas emissions. Over the past several decades, the raw material
intensity of industrialized countries has dropped significantly
(Bernardini and Galli, 1993; Williams, 1987). An important
question is whether such reductions in industrialized
economies simply reflect the shifting of energy- and matter-
intensive activities to other countries, in which case the net ef-
fect may be to hold constant or even increase global raw
material intensities. or whether there is a net reduction in the
energy- and matter-intensive activities themselves (IAEE,
1993).

"Beyond these specific urban planning issues are a whole set of
questions related to the development of new transportation
systems and technologies (Ross, 1989). The growth in per-
sonal mobility in industrialized countries over the past several
centuries has been closely correlated with technological ad-
vances in the types of vehicles used, the availability of fuels,
and the transportation infrastructure created. In turn, such fac-
tors interact in complex ways with urban form and develop-
ment and directly affect both the prospects for, and the costs
of, greenhouse gas mitigation. For example, the level of fu-
ture automobile emissions will depend in part on the degree of
saturation of automobile densities in urban areas, due to the
availability of effective air and high-speed ground transporta-
tion alternatives (Griibler e7 a/., 1993). In the metropolitan
area of Sao Paulo, for instance. most of the increase in atmo-

example, a first step towards increasing the relevance of a car-

through steady long-term policies. Nevertheless, more decen-

the unpredictability of alternative futures, the degree to which
they are subject to partial choice, and the need for analysis of
multiple alternatives.!* In the energy field, approaches based
on the concept of multiple scenarios were pioneered by Shell
International Petroleum Company in the early 1970s (Jeffer-

Such possibilities for alternative development patterns
highlight the technical feasibility of low carbon futures in de-
veloping countries that are compatible with national objec-
tives. But, in the opposite direction, past and present experi-
ence suggest that these countries might not be in a position to
switch to low greenhouse gas emitting profiles. The recent ex-
perience of economic stagnation or recession in a substantial
set of developing countries demonstrates, for example, that
access to superior technologies may be limited by the increase
of the share of second-hand equipment or the import of obso-
lete technology and products. In the same way. the prevailing
indebtedness of many countries could prohibit the adoption
of interurban transportation infrastructures or of the urban
infrastructure policies necessary to reach balanced human
settlement patterns. As a whole, barriers to more sustainable
development in the developing countries can hardly be
underestimated. These include insufficient capital stock (thus
preventing the use of the same technologies as in developed
countries), tariff and nontariff trade barriers, the organization
of international trade and the international financial environ-
ment, the distribution of national income, and very often the
lack of appropriate institutions for using the indigenous tech-
nical and economic capabilities of these countries.

The logical implication of this is the necessity to use multi-
ple scenarios in order to account for uncertainties with regard
to development patterns and the possibility of what econo-
mists call “multiple equilibria” in the long term, At time “f”
there are several possible market equilibria that could arise at
a future time “f+ (.e., several possible states of the world
characterized by different technical circumstances), and these
are not easily predictable from current trends. From a purely
analytical perspective, it is possible to resort to some subjec-
tive or logical probability distribution in order to narrow these
uncertainties among different scenarios and provide some
kind of average scenario. But to do so could be misleading in
a decision-making context. The point is that these alternative
base cases represent quite different, and internally consistent,
patterns of development. Many of the uncertainties about such
scenarios are due to the long-term consequences of short-term
decisions or behaviours, and to the collective expectations
prevailing at time “?"" regarding the future time “r+a.” In turn,
these decisions, behaviours. and expectations are part of a
particular sequence of events and cannot simply be combined
with the components of other such sequences to produce an
“average” or “most likely” sequence.

"In parallel to methodological concerns about the inade-

over the same period a series of critiques of conventional
“business-as-usual” views of the future, usually based on an
explicitly “environmental” perspective. One of the most
prominent of these early critiques was the Club of Rome’s
1972 book The Limits to Growth (Meadows and Meadows,
1972), the publication of which stimulated an extensive de-

(Mesarovic and Pestel, 1974), including the Leontieff report
launched to illustrate the International Development Strategy
adopted by the United Nations in 1974 (Tinbergen, 1976).
An attempt to articulate a developing country perspective on
these issucs led to the publication of the Bariloche report.

Moreover, given the difficulties of incorporating the feed-
backs between development patterns and economic variables
discussed above, a baseline scenario that gives rise to lower
estimates of mitigation costs cannot be interpreted as being
economically superior to other baselines. Such lower cost es-
timates simply mean that the incremental costs of mitigation
relative to that baseline are lower than the incremental costs
relative to some other baseline. However, this leaves unan-
swered the question of the relative costs (e.g.. transaction or
political costs) of achieving these different baseline scenarios.
Since different baselines represent different development
paths, each of which is potentially an “efficient” scenario,
they cannot be directly compared and no overall relative cost
assessment is possible. Two historical examples help to illus-
trate that this problem is far from being a simple intellectual
fancy.

ple baseline scenarios when long-term horizons are under
consideration. Such scenarios would represent different, in-

generated by altering the input parameters of a given model.
The point is not to predict what long-term outcomes are most
likely, an exercise at which few have been successful (Ascher.
1978, 1990), but to explore the economic and technical feasi-
bility and the costs associated with quite different develop-

very different assumptions about economic and technological

Given that different underlying assumptions about development
patterns can give rise to a number of quite different types and
levels of greenhouse gas emissions as well as a number of
mitigation costs and potentials, a comparison between cost as-
sessments theoretically requires an evaluation of baseline and
mitigation scenario assumptions, including technology data.2!
Such an evaluation should identify key determinants and as-
sumptions behind the cost estimates in order to explain differ-
ences. Without a comprehensive and transparent documenta-
tion of the full set of scenario assumptions, any comparison of
cost estimates coming from studies with very different base-
line scenarios will be misleading. For example, a mitigation
scenario derived from baseline assumptions that incorporate
substantial air quality improvements for reasons unrelated to
climate change is likely to give rise to greenhouse gas mitiga-
tion cost estimates that are higher per unit of reduction than a
mitigation scenario derived from baseline assumptions with-
out such improvements.”? Similarly, mitigation cost estimates

Historically the debate in the energy field has been framed
by the distinction between “top-down” and “bottom-up” stud-
ies, a distinction that can be applied in other fields as well.
Basically, top-down models analyze aggregated behaviours
based on economic indices of prices and elasticities. These
models began mainly as macroeconomic models that tried to
capture the overall economic impact of a climate policy, which.
because of the difficulty of assessing other types of policy in-
struments, was usually in the form of a carbon tax or, more
rarely, tradable permits. Bottom-up models, on the other hand.
rely on the detailed analysis of technical potential, focussing on
the integration of technology costs and performance data.

taken into account to justify it when it was first implemented
in 1975, the existence of this programme can be shown to lead

So far, many questions are still pending with regard to the

In response, the professional reflex of many economists
has been to call attention to the reasons why consumers do not
adopt technologies that appear to be optimal, and to suggest
that accounting for these reasons, together with the economic
feedbacks of a given policy, would reduce the magnitude of,
or eliminate, the efficiency gap that is actually achievable.

Because of the difficulty of extrapolating past trends over
the long run, the purpose of some modellers is to “explore”
the future rather than to predict it and, in so doing, to provide
potentially counterintuitive assessments. This leads to a sce-
nario analysis approach, which involves building up different
coherent visions of the future (each of which can undergo sen-
sitivity testing) based on different values for key assumptions
about economic behaviour, physical resource endowments, or
technical progress, together with assumptions about economic
or population growth. The first step in such analyses is the
generation of a “reference” or “nonintervention” scenario.
This is then contrasted with alternative cases involving an ar-
ray of policy measures, such us carbon taxes or energy effi-
ciency regulations, giving rise to one or several “policy” or
“intervention” scenarios, but the policy analysis is relevant
only in the context of each baseline scenario. This approach is
increasingly used for climate change analysis and was the ba-
sis for the 1992 IPCC scenarios (Legget et al., 1992), It ts
shared by both bottom-up and top-down models*4 and indeed
tends to favour the development of hybrid models (which are
discussed at greater length below). In terms of representing
and simulating the behaviour of economic agents, two method-

cost optimization, in which society maximizes the utility of
consumption over the Jong run. The other involves the effort
to simulate real-world behaviour predictively in terms of tech-

Among bottom-up models two approaches are usually dis-

simulation or optimization models, which simulate invest-

Given an exogenous perturbation such as a change in the
tax system, CGE models produce a price-dependent general
equilibrium response due to the behaviour of economic agents.
This has two impacts on cost assessments. First, because of
their formal structure, these models calculate a new equilib-
rium but do not provide an accurate picture of the time path
towards this equilibrium; they tend as a result to understate
transition costs. Second. because they rely on a perfect market
equilibrium assumption, they do not allow for structural un-
employment over the long run and in this and other ways re-

Table 8.2 also shows that this simple characterization of
the differences between top-down and bottom-up approaches
is increasingly misleading, since more recent versions of each
approach have tended to move in the direction of greater de-
tail in those dimensions that were relatively less developed in
the past. This is possible because the four dimensions shown
in Table 8.1 are independent of each other. Thus any particular
model can be located at virtually any point on the spectrum
represented by each dimension. It is this independence of key
structural characteristics that makes it so hard to classify the
large population of existing models on any single spectrum,
whether bottom-up to top-down, or any other. Instead we in-
creasingly have a wide range of models, which, in terms of
their structure, occupy different places on each of the four di-
mensions shown here. Thus, although the differences repre-
sented by these four dimensions remain important, no simple
classification scheme is adequate.

model, in contrast, would try to estimate the technology mix
that would result from actual decisions, based on factors such
as more complex preferences (people preferring private cars
even if the cost per kilometre is higher than railway trans-

of technologies), capital constraints, attitudes to risk (via
higher discount rates for some agents) and uncertainty (actual
performance of new technologies), or any kind of market bar-

than prescriptive studies about mitigation, unless appropriate

utility and cost minimization) and a market clearing mecha-

marginal costs). The dynamics of these models are produced
by capital accumulation and/or by the exogenous growth of
the factors of production and productivity. In contrast to the
neo-Keynesian models, they do not rely systematically on
econometric relationships. They are, instead, frequently

The terms “top” and “bottom,” in the usual jargon of the
economic modeller, are commonly linked to the distinction
between aggregate models and disaggregated models. The
top-down label is derived from the way in which the first de-
velopers of these models applied econometric techniques (i.c..
statistical analyses of past trends) to historical data on con-
sumption, prices, and incomes to estimate price and income
elasticities for final demand goods and services such as en-
ergy, transportation, food, and industrial products, These ag-
gregate models were criticized for not providing a complex
enough description of the determinants underlying sectoral
demand dynamics. Simulation-oriented technico-economic
models were then developed to explore the potential for a pos-
sible decoupling of energy demand from economic growth.
This required “bottom-up” or disaggregated analysis of tech-
nical alternatives and demand for specific services.

the national economy and the global economy. Given all of

technologies serving those end uses generally meant that greater

Bearing in mind these fundamental differences in ap-
proach. it is clear that there is no a priori reason that the two
modelling approaches must give different results. Top-down
models account for the technological changes so valued by
bottom-up analysis via two parameters: (1) the autonomous
energy efficiency index (AEEI), and (2) the elasticity of sub-
stitution between the aggregate inputs to households and
firms. AEEI is a function of time (a proxy for all the long-run
reasons for equipment turnover) and suggests the rate at
which the penetration of new technologies may change the
energy intensity of the economy. The elasticity of substitution
is a function of relative prices of inputs and allows measure-
ment of the degree to which capital or labour can be substi-
tuted for energy (i.e.. energy intensity can be reduced) as
energy prices rise relative to these other inputs. The values of
AEE] and elasticity of substitution can be adjusted to provide
results that match those frequently suggested by bottom-up
analysts.

This characterization of technology makes it difficult to es-
tablish explicit links between production functions in eco-
nomic models, on the one hand, and technology projections,
on the other. For example, there is a gap between the findings
of Jorgensen (1984) and Hogan and Jorgensen (1990) with
respect to the negative correlation between technological
change and energy prices in the U.S. economy and the obser-
vation of accelerated innovations at a technical level. The
reason is that that technological innovation can have two dif-
ferent meanings. For an engineer, it implies increased tech-
nical efficiency and therefore greater productivity. For an
economist. however, productivity growth is correlated with
many other factors than mere technology characteristics; a de-
pressed demand or growing uncertainties can result in lower
economic productivity, even if the technical efficiency of
equipment is very high. Consequently, both descriptions can
be internally consistent, but each may represent a different de-
finition of technological change. Put another way, both de-
scriptions of technological change make sense, but each

Another way to look at the difference between these ap-
proaches is by returning to the first three types of mitigation
costs introduced in Section 8.2.2. We can say that top-down
models focus on financial flows across the whole economy
and provide rather sophisticated analytical tools at this level,
whereas sectoral models, which have tended also to be top-
down but sometimes with fairly detailed representation of
technology, focus on the market dynamics stemming from a
given industrial structure but with little consideration devoted
to overall feedbacks with the rest of the economy. Finally.
bottom-up models focus on the technical margins of freedom
likely to be evident at a microeconomic level and provide a
detailed analysis of the technical and economic dimensions of
specific policy options. Historically, this difference in focus
has led to significant differences in results, as the larger eco-
nomic feedback loops originally examined in top-down mod-
els (higher production costs, lower investments in nonenergy
sectors) tended to increase the macroeconomic costs of emis-
sion reductions relative to bottom-up results. More recently,
other feedbacks that tend to reduce overall costs (efficient tax
recycling) have been examined in top-down analyses, while
bottom-up methods have increasingly incorporated detailed
examination of the behavioural dimensions of the policy op-
tions examined. The effect of these developments has been to
narrow the range of difference in mitigation costs between

these two approaches.

Top-down modellers, who tend to be economists, are gen-
erally reluctant to doubt the economic efficiency of business
and household consumption choices, although they recognize
the classical imperfections in markets (oligopoly, natural mo-
nopoly, subsidies, etc.). They therefore tend to assume that if
a technology does not penetrate the market to the extent that a
bottom-up engineering/economic analysis (which focuses
only on tangible costs) suggests that it could, it is probably at
least in part because the intangible cost and/or consumer sur-
plus differences are at least large enough to make the invest-
ment unattractive. As a consequence of this general assump-
tion, many economists are more likely to put their faith in
values for AEEI and elasticity of substitution that have
emerged from studies of the economy using statistical regres-
sion of historical aggregate data sets. Since the historical data
are based on actual behaviour, behavioural parameters esti-
mated from them may represent a synthesis of all tangible and

Given these results, bottom-up modellers tend to argue that
appropriate policy will cause energy-efficient products to
have lower transaction costs and risks than are generally as-
sumed by firms and households, and perhaps even higher
consumer surpluses. From this perspective the market as
currently configured simply isn’t delivering levels of energy
efficiency that would be economically advantageous, neither
at the microlevel of direct financial costs nor at more aggre-
gate and inclusive levels of cost. They suggest that significant
potentials for emission reductions can be realized at net eco-
nomic savings through a combination of mandatory energy
efficiency standards, labelling and auditing programmes,
least-cost planning-oriented utility regulatory reforms, profit
incentives for utility demand-side management programmes,
market-pull incentives provided through innovative utility
or government procurement programmes, and increased re-
search and development and commercialization efforts for
small-scale modular technologies with short gestation peri-

The differences in results between top-down and bottom-
up modelling analyses are thus rooted in a complex interplay
among differences in purpose, model structure, and input as-
sumptions. The growing tendency for the development of hy-
brid modelling approaches means that differences of model
structure are becoming a less important factor in many cli-
mate modelling studies, but the overall difference in perspec-
tive and thinking about energy markets represented by these
two modelling approaches remains. Hybrid modelling ap-
proaches allow the exploration of the relative importance and
implications of different input assumptions and are likely to
narrow the difference in results between bottom-up and top-
down studies. They will not by themselves, however, resolve
the underlying question of whether energy markets are effi-
cient with respect to the delivery of energy efficiency gains or
not. Moreover, it remains to be seen whether these new ap-
proaches will be equally fruitful in fulfilling the range of pur-
poses discussed in Section 8.4.2.1. In particular, it seems clear
that we need to improve our ability to explore long-term de-
velopment paths or configurations of technology that are very
different from those typical of experience in past decades
(ie., the alternative future scenarios that are often the subject
of backcasting analyses). Much work remains to be done to
address these larger issues in a satisfactory way.

Flow summation method. Using this approach, the first and second examples each have a cost of $10 per tonne. The third
example is more difficult to analyze. Although the costs are clearly identified, the accomplishments are unclear. The cumu-
lative tonnage sequestered is cyclical, rising to 100 tonnes just prior to harvest but falling to zero immediately following
harvest. This suggests that under this analytical approach there is no value to capturing carbon that is eventually released, no
matter how long the storage period.

clear. As the rotation length approaches infinity, the mean carbon storage asymptotically approaches 100 tonnes. This would
suggest a cost of $10 per tonne. fy instead, a 50-year rotation length is artificially imposed on the analysis. the mean carbon

"Most carbon sink cost analyses have employed the first cost concept described in this chapter, namely, the direct costs of
specific technical measures. However, there is no consensus on the definition of the summary statistic “dollars per tonne of
carbon sequestration.” A review of the literature reveals at least three distinct definitions of this measure of cost-effective-
ness, The differénce among the definitions revolves around how each deals with the relative value of carbon flows that oc-
cur at different points in time. Because carbon-sink-enhancing activities result in very uneven flows of carbon — flows that
in some cases occur over several decades — the treatment of the time value of carbon is important.

statistic — the present tonnes equivalent (PTE) — and divides that figure into the present value of costs.

The choice of an appropriate method from among these three candidates depends on the underlying policy for which the
cost analysis is being conducted. If the underlying policy is one that is concerned only with capping the total accumulation
of carbon and is not concerned with when the reductions occur, then the flow summation method may be appropriate.* Al-
ternatively, if the damages from greenhouse gas accumulation are continuous so that interim damages matter, the leveliza-

appropriate choice.

As with energy studies, differences among the studies that
give rise to a wedge between direct and social costs occur at
each stage of a carbon sequestration cost analysis. These stem
from different assumptions about the suitability of forestry
and agricultural practices, different treatments of land and
forestry practice implementation costs, and different esti-
mates of the expected accomplishments of the forestry prac-
tices and valuation of those accomplishments in terms of
greenhouse gas emission benefits as well as double dividend

As Table 8.4 indicates, a variety of forestry practices may
contribute to increasing the size of forest and agricultural car-

in the energy field, the appropriate forestry and agricultural
practice for carbon sequestration is, in theory, the one that
promises to be a cost-effective way to capture and store car-

The transaction costs associated with establishing forestry
and agricultural programmes can be significant. Even in well-
developed market economies, the costs of programme ad-
ministration can rise to as much as [5% of the total costs of
land rental, establishment, and maintenance (Richards et al,
1993). It is reasonable to expect that where land and labour
markets are not so well developed or when a public adminis-
tration is not well established, the costs of administration and
information gathering might rise to a much higher level, even
surpassing the direct costs of land acquisition and tree plant-
ing. In the context of developing countries where the pressure
on land comes from agricultural purposes or from wood ex-
ports, these transaction costs should, theoretically, encompass
policies required to slacken this pressure, This requirement
could narrow the range of teasible low-cost carbon sequestra-
tion opportunities.

With respect to land costs, studies of carbon sequestration
costs in the United States have, for example. employed sev-
eral methods to identify the social costs associated with con-
version of land to forest. These have included the use of land
rental rates derived from surveys (Moulton and Richards,
1990), the use of market prices adjusted for the elasticity of
demand for agricultural land (Richards et a/., 1993), the use
of the estimated lost profits from removing the land from agri-
cultural production (Parks and Hardie, 1995), and the use of
consumer surplus loss [rom increases in food prices due to the
constriction of agricultural land availability (Adams ef al,
1993). In the absence of extensive experience, estimating land
costs has proven difficult because of the low reliability of data
on the elasticities of demand for agricultural land. Also, un-
certainties about the future of government subsidies for agri-
culture raise questions about land costs. These subsidies tend
to drive a wedge between the market prices and the social cost
of land.

These accounting difficulties are oOhvionely

As the discussion in Box 8.2 illustrates, harvesting can
have a significant impact on the carbon benefits of a project.
Further, the measure of that impact depends very much on the
choice of summary statistics. At the same time, the economic
benefits of timber harvesting can be significant. Studies that
do not quantify either of these two effects will overstate both
the costs of carbon sink projects and the carbon benefits. Al-
though the effect on carbon costs of ignoring timber harvest-
ing is indeterminate, it is likely that inclusion of forestry
products in the analysis would generally lower unit costs.
Studies that include the effects of harvesting on carbon flows
but do not incorporate its economic benefits will almost cer-
tainly overstate the unit costs of carbon sequestration. At the
extreme, some forestry practices may pay for themselves in
the form of forestry products and provide the carbon benefits
as a costless (i.e., no-regrets) bonus.2? For example, Xu (1994)
suggests that there may be negative costs associated with
some carbon sequestration practices in China. Conversely.
those studies that only consider the benefits of forestry prod-
ucts but do not adjust the carbon flows to reflect increased re-
leases of carbon back to the atmosphere will understate the
costs of carbon sequestration.

"costs of carbon sequestration.

It is apparent that, as with energy efficiency, there are op-
portunities in the carbon sink area to achieve double divi-
dends. These become evident under an analysis that provides
full accounting for the wood and agricultural product benefits
of projects as well as for the less tangible benefits such
as habitat and watershed preservation, improved local self-
reliance, and soil erosion control. However, full accounting
must also include those factors that tend to increase social
costs relative to financial costs, such as the effect of removing
honmarginal quantities of land from agricultural production,
transaction costs associated with establishing new land use
patterns, administrative costs of implementing a large-scale
carbon sequestration programme, and decreases in carbon
benefits associated with timber harvesting. Perhaps the most
important factor, one commonly ignored by carbon sink cost
studies, is the potential for “leakage” of the carbon sequestra-
tion gains. If the selective subsidization of tree planting and
other forestry practices creates a new supply of timber, own-
ers of existing forests may try to avoid competition in the tim-
ber market by accelerating harvest of their stocks, decreasing
the amount of postharvest replanting, and avoiding expansion
of the holdings.

suggests that the cost of greenhouse gas abatement measures should
be calculated net of the effect of any measures taken to move the
economy towards the production frontier (¢.g.. the effect of fiscal

a carbon tax). By suggesting that no economic double dividends
should be included in the cost of abatement, such arguments reduce
the estimate of cost-effective abatement potential, but they also im-

"¢ Infrastructure decisions are critical because they can en
hance or restrict the number and types of future option:
and different infrastructure decisions can lead to ver
different cost outcomes. This issue is of particular im
portance to developing countries, where major infra
structure decisions will be made in the near term.

If the climate issue is formulated in terms of stabilizing
atmospheric concentrations, the choice of emission time
path is critical in determining the overall price tag. It i:
important to identify those paths that minimize the costs
of achieving a particular concentration target.

The overall impact of a carbon tax will depend not only
on the size of the tax, but also on the uses to which the
revenues are put. If carbon tax revenues are used to re-
duce more distortionary taxes, overall emission reduc-
tion costs will be reduced. Inefficient tax recycling
could, however, increase costs.

There is need for both detailed (bottom-up) analysis of
technological options and also more aggregate (top-
down) analysis of economic effects. Whereas, histori-
cally, these two approaches have been associated with
very different cost estimates, this need not always be the
case. Indeed, widely differing methods can produce
quite similar results when calibrated to the same set of
input assumptions.

Given differences in marginal emission reduction costs
among countries, international cooperation can signifi-
cantly reduce the global price tag for emission reduction.
Economic efficiency would be enhanced by carrying
out emission reduction where it is cheapest to do so.
Estimates of the costs of stabilizing CO, emissions
at 1990 levels in OECD countries vary widely. Many
bottom-up studies suggest that the costs of achieving
this target over the next few decades may be negli-
gible. Given rising baseline emissions over the longer
term, however, many top-down studies suggest that the
annual costs of stabilizing emissions may ultimately
exceed 1-2% of GDP.

The costs of stabilizing emissions for economies in
transition may be small relative to OECD countries.
The potential for cost-effective reductions in energy use
is apt to be considerable, but the realizable potential will
depend on what economic and technological develop-

¢ Estimates of the cost of greenhouse gas emission reduc-
tion are sensitive to assumptions about appropriate
model structure, demographic and economic growth,
the cost and availability of both demand-side and
supply-side energy options, the desired level and tim-
ing of abatement, and the choice of policy instruments.
Different assumptions have led to a wide range of emis-
sion reduction cost estimates.
Despite significant differences in views, there is agree-
ment that some energy efficiency improvements (per-
haps 10-30% of current consumption, depending on base-
line assumptions and the implementation time frame)
can be realized at negative to slightly positive costs. The
existence of such a no-regrets potential depends on the
existence of substantial market or institutional imper-
fections that prevent cost-effective emission reduction
measures from being taken. The key question is whether
such imperfections can be removed cost effectively by
policy measures.
Energy-related emissions can be reduced through both
demand-side (energy efficiency) and supply-side (alter-
native sources of supply) options. In the short term, de-
mand-side options are cheapest in most countries.
Estimates of the costs of stabilizing CO, emissions vary
widely as a result of differences in both the baseline sce-
narios used (e.g.. how much energy efficiency or what
rate of economic growth is contained in the baseline
scenario) and the calculated costs of various policy
measures.

¢ There has been much more analysis to date of emission
reduction potentials and costs for industrialized coun-
tries than for other parts of the world. Moreover, many
existing models are not well suited to the study of econ-
omies in transition or developing country economies.
Much more work is needed to develop and apply models
outside of developed countries.

- The overall cost of abatement programmes will ulti-
mately be determined by the rate of capital replacement,
the discount rate, and the effect of research and devel-
opment. Appropriate long-run signals to encourage re-
search and development will reduce long-run costs. The
implementation of any no-regrets potential will increase
the time available to learn about climate risks and to

"tries. However, these are likely to be insufficient to off-
set rapidly increasing emission baselines associated
with, for example, increased economic growth. In the
absence of a highly favourable allocation of carbon
emission rights, the likely magnitude of emission reduc-
tion will be particularly costly for developing countries.

"ment path is chosen. A critical issue is the future of
structural changes in these countries that may drasti-
cally change the level of baseline emissions and the
emission reduction costs.

"In recent years, there have been numerous studies of the costs
of reducing CO, emissions. Unfortunately, estimates have
spanned such a wide range that they have been of limited
value to policy making. Figure 9.1 and Table 9.1, which sum-
marize recent projections of the costs of reducing U.S. CO,
emissions. are illustrative of the current lack of consensus
about the costs of emission reduction. Whereas some studies
place losses at several percent of GDP, others question
whether there will be any losses at all, An essential first step

"A variety of options can be adopted in response to the
prospect of increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in
the earth’s atmosphere. These include (1) options that elimi-
nate or reduce greenhouse gas emissions: (2) options that off-
set emissions, for example, through the enhancement of sinks;
and (3) options that help human and ecological systems adjust
or adapt to new climate conditions and events. The first and
second types of interventions take effect prior to climate change
and are intended to slow its pace. As such, they are referred to
as “mitigation” measures. The third category of intervention
takes place after warming occurs and falls under the classifi

cation of “adaptation.” This chapter reviews existing studies
of the economic costs of mitigating greenhouse gas emis-

rate of $6.50/barrel each decade until 2030. (This trajectory
was selected for its consistency with those from general equi-
librium models which incorporate international trade in oil.)
Oil and gas resources were based on the optimistic 95th per-
centile estimates of Masters ef al. (1987).

Table 9.4 shows a marked variation in GDP losses across

to reduce GDP by 0.2-0.7% in the year 2010 - roughly a $20
billion to $70 billion loss for that year. Estimates of the costs

9.4 represent averages of the mode] results. Note that the size
of the required tax doubles as the limit is tightened to 20% be-
low 1990 levels and nearly doubles again for a 50% reduction.
This suggests that the economic efforts to be devoted are non-
linear with respect to the level of controls in any given year.
That is, incremental reductions are apt to cost more as the ab-
solute level of allowable emissions is reduced.

Two parameters are particularly important in explaining
the differences in tax projections: the price elasticity of en-
ergy demand and the speed with which the capital stock ad-
justs to higher energy prices. Neither was controlled in the
EMF experiments but rather they were left to the choice of the
modellers. Not surprisingly, those models using lower price
elasticities required higher taxes to achieve the same emission
goal. Those models which assumed greater malleability of
capital required lower taxes.

Figure 9.5 shows the average GDP losses across models.
Holding emissions at 1990 levels results in a 0.3% loss in
2000. This rises to 1.5% by the middle of the century. That
GDP losses increase over time should come as no surprise. In-
creasing amounts of carbon must be removed from the energy
system in order to hold emissions to a particular target. GDP
losses also increase with the stringency of the target. With a
20% reduction, losses exceed 2% of GDP in 2050. With a
50% reduction. losses exceed 3% of GDP.

In making these calculations. the modellers assumed a
lump sum redistribution of tax revenues. That is, tax revenues
are used to replace other tax payments by individuals and cor-
porations without affecting marginal tax rates or total tax rev-
enues. The GDP losses calculated in this manner measure the
cost of the distortions to the economy caused by the imposi-
tion of the carbon tax. There are no credits or penalties for
lump sum recycling of tax revenues. The assumption of lump
sum recycling avoids confusing the economic impacts of car-
bon taxes with costs or benefits attributable to potential uses
of the revenues.

The overall impact of a carbon tax will depend not only on the
size of the tax but also on the uses to which the revenues are
put. In the standard EMF scenarios, it was assumed that tax
revenues would be redistributed in a neutral manner (i.e.
without affecting the marginal tax rates), There are, of course.
numerous ways in which tax revenues can be used. These
include reducing budget deficits: reducing marginal rates
of income, payroll. corporate, or other taxes: granting ta.
incentives to preferred activities: and increasing the level or
government expenditures. The costs of the tax will vary

widely, depending on how the revenues are recycled.

There are three reasons why deferring emission reductions
may reduce costs (Leary and Scheraga, 1994). First, large
emission reductions in the near term will require accelerated
replacement of the existing capital stock. This is apt to be
costly. There will be more opportunities for reducing emis-
sions cheaply once the current capital equipment turns over.
Second, the availability and cost of technologies for fuel
switching will improve over time. As a result, the costs of re-
ducing a tonne of carbon emissions will decline. Finally, even
if the costs of removing a tonne of carbon were the same in all
periods, a positive discount rate will favour deferred reduc-
tions. Model simulations by Cohan ef al. (1994) suggest that
deferring emission reductions can reduce costs substantially.
For example, they find that delaying the target date from 2010
to 2015 for stabilizing U.S. emissions at 20% below 1990 lev-
els can reduce control costs by as much as 20%.

A compromise position is found in studies using longer
time horizons (30-40 years or more). Over these long periods,
most capital goods will be replaced more than once, and many
several times. Here, least-cost efficiency levels can be achieved
within the time horizon, even if policies do not shift all or
most investments the first time around. The assumptions
about the effectiveness of policies are thus more realistic in
these studies.

Most bottom-up studies do not quantify the feedback effect
from lower energy demand on fuel prices or the further effect
of lower fuel prices and energy service costs on cost-effective
energy efficiency levels and energy demand. As a result,
bottom-up studies may at once underestimate feasible eco-
nomic savings from carbon reductions and overestimate the
amount of emission reductions that market transformation
policies can bring.

Differences in technical analysis. Of the technical factors,
the most important ones appear to be the level of detail in ana-
lyzing and representing supply curves for technology options,
notably those for demand-side efficiency improvements. Bot-
tom-up studies that rely on more detailed and comprehensive
assessments of these options will tend to arrive at larger effi-
ciency potentials and lower costs of saved energy than less
detailed studies. Even then, uncertain baseline data for equip-
ment use and efficiency in individual end uses leave some
room for disagreement among technologists.

"Note that the GDP costs of the carbon tax vary consider-
ably depending on how the revenues are recycled. In some

that the GDP costs of the tax would be increased over the neu-
tral case if the revenues were used simply to reduce the gov-

government expenditures was not examined, it is possible that
such a policy would increase the GDP costs of the tax over the

Differences in assumed policy effectiveness. All bottom-
up scenarios of future energy demand assume that policy
intervention can at least partially shift the investment be-
haviours of consumers and firms from historically subopti-
mal patterns to economically optimal choices. At one end of
the spectrum, it ts assumed that policies will shift every re-
placement purchase or expansion of end-use equipment that
will occur over the time period studied. For short time hori-
zons (10-20 years), this assumption implies that a complete
shift to efficient equipment will be achieved within one cycle
of capital turnover. This assumption is almost certainly too
optimistic.

In this section we survey some of the key assumptions and re-

there has not yet been an effort to undertake a harmonized
comparative analysis of U.S. bottom-up models, as has been
the case with U.S. top-down models. However, a survey of the
approaches at least allows for some tentative observations.

Second, most energy efficiency improvements are intro-
duced at the “economic optimal” rate of capital stock turn-
over, with the more long-lived capital goods lasting twenty to
thirty years or more. Due to this synchronicity, cost-effective
efficiency improvements continue to occur. As a result, botwom-
up studies estimate “transition benefits” rather than “transae-
tion costs” for such technology shifts.

This pattern reflects two major factors: First. bottom-up
studies identify large energy efficiency potentials that are net
exploited in the reference case, due to the high transaction
costs, The studies assume that these high transaction costs
will be reduced through suitable policy interventions, such as
efficiency standards, least-cost utility planning, and other in-
formation and financial incentive programmes,

An overview of the main assumptions and results of the
major U.S. bottom-up studies is provided in Tables 9.6, 9.7,
and 9.8. Most studies test the sensitivity of their results to
changes in GDP growth rates. Energy prices are generally as-
sumed exogenously, although some studies have attempted to
incorporate thy feedback effects of efficiency measures on en-
ergy prices. RIGES, for example, assumes low-cost fossil en-
ergy in 2030 as a consequence of successful implementation
of energy efficiency. In contrast, Carlsmith ef af (1990) as-
sume high rates of near-term energy price increases.

general, these country-specific studies have had relatively

Bottom-up studies for Canada were compiled and re-
viewed by Robinson and colleagues in the study Canadian
Options for Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction (Robinson
etal., 1993). Estimates of cost-effective CO, emission reduc-
tion potential by 2010, relative to a reference (or baseline)
scenario, ranged from 20% to 40%, with a median of about
23%. Relative to 1988 or 1990, many studies showed savings
in energy use or emissions of between 10 and 30%, with a me-
dian of about 16%.

scenarios. Among the more interesting is one in which emis-
sions are permanently held to 1990 levels. Figure 9.7 com-
pares annual GDP losses for four models: ERM, GREEN.
Global 2100 (MR). and CRTM. The models are fairly consis-

the aggregation effect. Combining all non-U.S. OECD coun-

ences. As we will see in the next section. the variance around

a 20% reduction in U.S. CO, emissions by the year 2010, for
example, range between -0.6 and +0.5% of GDP (see Table
9.7). As noted in Section 9.2.1.2.1, this difference is explained
at least in part by the nature and level of detail of the input
assumptions used in the specific bottom-up analysis. The
RIGES study, for instance, assumes 100% penetration of mar-
kets by all technologies shown to be cost-effective in an en-
gincering/economic analysis. In contrast. Carlsmith ef al. con-
strained their model to link all market penetration of efficient
technologies to consumer behaviour parameters (expressed a

ciency standards), This latter approach did not lead to 100%
market penctration by efficient technologies.

The potential for end-use improvements remains one of the
more controversial issues in the greenhouse debate. The wide

Assumptions about the rate at which backstop technologies
can enter the energy system also tend to be important.
GREEN, for example, assumes a more rapid introduction rate
than the other models. Hence its marginal cost of emission
abatement is lower for each tonne of carbon removed. This,
coupled with the lower baseline, easily explains the ranking
of cost estimates among the three models.

How a model handles preexisting energy taxes is also im-
portant. Many countries rely on energy taxes as a major
source of revenue. [fa country already has high energy taxes,
it will require a larger carbon tax to achieve a given percent-
age increase in retail energy price levels. This means that the
deadweight losses are apt to be higher, Unfortunately, models
differ widely in their treatment of preexisting taxes, adding
yet another reason why results are apt to differ. (This was not
an issue in our review of ULS. analyses since U.S. energy
taxes are much lower than those elsewhere in the OECD.
They are more like user fees. barely covering the costs of

Neo-Keynesian models embed more rigidities and allow
for unemployment in the short run in response to shocks to the
economy and for structural unemployment due to inadequate
demand for labour. Recycling through payroll tax reductions
can increase demand for labour and reduce both cyclical and
structural unemployment. In both types of models, other fac-
tors may also be responsible for increased employment. For
example, energy taxes may cause labour to be substituted for
energy and technical progress to be biassed to save energy and

use labour.

Table 9.10 compares the results from several studies which
suggest that the GDP losses of an energy tax could be at least
partially offset through effective revenue recycling that re-
duces particularly burdensome taxes. Where the agreement
among these studies breaks down is in whether recycling
through appropriate cuts in other taxes can actually increase
employment. This type of recycling can be compared cither
with a lump-sum recycling measure or with the baseline sce-
nario. The first comparison aims at isolating the gains due to
corrections of fiscal distortions from the specific dividend
yielded by the carbon/energy tax; the second comparison as-
sesses the overall result of the reform and assumes implicitly
that concern about climate change facilitates its acceptance.
Some studies suggest that the negative impact on employment
and growth is only slightly reduced. whereas others suggest
that an energy tax recycled through a payroll tax cut will in-

If the taxes were restricted to carbon-based fuels, the impacts
would be unambiguous. Carbon taxes reduce CO, emis-
sions through both their effects on energy consumption and
fucl choice. However. the EC proposal represents a depar-
ture from this pure case by not only aiming to limit CO, emis-
sions but also to achieve other objectives such as energy
efficiency in general. Coupling an energy tax to a carbor:
tax will lead to additional conservation, but it will also have
an impact on fuel choice. By raising the price of carbon-free

studies of a proposal for limiting CO, emissions put forth
by the European Commission (1992), This proposal, which
called for levying new taxes on most major sources of energy,
was perhaps the most widely discussed emission-control ini-

and partly on energy content. Using oil as a point of reference.
the tax would level off at $10 per barrel in the year 2000, Nu-

taxed at a lower rate ~ approximately 50° of that of carbon-

In the UNEP studies, Denmark, the Netherlands, and
France followed different principles for baseline definition.
Denmark defined its baseline to include the persistence of
some major inefficiencies, implying that a large potential for
no-regrets emission reduction options was found. The French
study accounted for transaction costs for adopting more effi-

The study results are highly dependent on the assumptions
about energy efficiency measures included in the baseline
scenario. The CEC report and the ETSAP project assumed
that all profitable efficiency measures were included in the
baseline, which meant that all emission reduction options, by
definition, would have positive costs in these analyses. How-

Baseline CO, emissions range from a drop of 3% by 2010

Differences in assessed reduction potential and costs are
also seen in the UNEP studies for Denmark, the Netherlands,
and France. These differences are consistent with “real” varia-
tions between the countries in the carbon content of their en-

lesser degree, the Netherlands have high emission-reduction

"One of the main explanations behind the widely varying
national cost assessments is the heterogeneity of the national
technology data used in the analyses. Differences in economic
growth, for instance, for Spain and Greece, could partly ex-
plain the high marginal emission reduction cost in these coun-
tries but cannot fully explain all intercountry differences. It
seems surprising, for example, that France, with an energy
system characterized by a large installed nuclear capacity,
arrives at an abatement cost very similar to that of Britain and
Germany, whereas Italy arrives at a lower cost. This is in
contrast to the fact that the scope for manoeuvre in the power
sector is much higher in the latter three countries, owing to
the dominance of conventional power production, than in
France.

Though the choice of models in bottom-up analysis may have
some effect on the calculated carbon reduction costs, these re-

the CEC, UNEP, IPSEP, and ETSAP studies. Differences ap-

There is some validity to this criticism. The removal of
subsidies will result in costless conservation in addition to
that induced by the AEEI factor. The early studies may have
indeed underestimated the potential for demand-side savings.
(It is important to note, however that the criticism applies
more to the choice of input assumptions than to the models
themselves. The models are not inherently limited to scenar-
ios in which markets clear.)

The problem is further complicated by the fact that the
transition process per se generates a state of crisis. The Rus-
sian GDP, for example, declined by 18.5% in 1992. Economic
activity in 1993 was lower than in 1985 (Bashmakov, 1994).
Consequently, standard econometric techniques derived from
historical records cannot be applied without caution. Until
these economies achieve a more stable footing, predictions of
future growth will be tenuous at best.

A key issue in extending top-down models to emerging
economies is the treatment of energy subsidies. Many of the
early studies showed relatively high emission reduction costs
(see, for example, Dean and Hoeller, 1992). Critics claim that
the high numbers reflect “the difficulties top-down studies
have with economies undergoing restructuring” (Grubb ef al.
1993). They argue that the high costs are in large part due to a
failure to adequately capture the demand-side impacts of sub-
sidy removal.

efficiencies in the structure of incentives. Models that assume
the existence of market mechanisms will miss many of the
important features of these economies. Applying equilib-
rium models to planned economies assumes that planned
economies mimic the behaviour of market economies. This
assumption is impossible to accept empirically, particularly
with regard to energy use.

Overall, the divergent results suggest the need for further
empirical research on how end-use market efficiency could
improve the implementation of end-use options. Also, com-
parative bottom-up modelling exercises should be done in
which identical national data sets for efficiency potential and
costs are combined with standardized assumptions about im-
plemented fractions in the reference case. Such an exercise
has already been done for Denmark. It was shown that uni-
form input assumptions in the EFOM model for Denmark
and the Danish UNEP study produced very similar results
(Morthorst, 1993).

in the Danish UNEP study, abatement costs increase from 10

50% (baseline reference). The introduction of more technolo-

the cost curve where marginal costs increase slowly. This ten-
dency has also been seen when short-term reduction targets
are compared with long-term targets. The marginal emission

historically estimated aggregate data on end-use demand, and
in some cases this may imply a more pessimistic assessment
of the savings potential. However, studies have also shown
that when identical data on efficiency potentials are used, op-

optimization models are being continuously refined. A large

"F294 A review of top-down studies

The problems of adapting top-down models for use in transi-
tional economies explains the dearth of applications for this
region of the world, particularly when compared to the grow-
ing body of analysis being amassed on developed economies.
The few studies that do exist were conducted by Western
economists, using models that are best suited to application
within the OECD. This is not to imply that the studies are
without merit. Indeed, as we will see shortly, they have
yielded some useful insights about the costs of emission re-
duction. Nevertheless, as we move beyond the OECD, we
need to be increasingly circumspect in the interpretation of re-
sults.

The same result was confirmed in a subsequent study by

emissions at 1990 levels. It is important to note that price re-
forms and the removal of energy subsidies were included in
the “baseline” scenario. This enabled the modellers to separate
the impacts of restructuring from those of a carbon constraint.

Despite the intrinsic difficulties of applying top-down
models to the countries of this region, the implications of
these analyses are important. The costs of stabilizing emis-
sions may be relatively small for economies in transition.
Market failures have undoubtedly limited investment in en-
ergy efficiency. The potential for cost-effective reductions in
energy use is apt to be considerable. The key is a successful
transition towards a new institutional context in which, under
whatever form, prices actually reflect the full cost of energy.

This section summarizes selected studies of the potential and
cost of carbon emission reduction strategies in the post-
planned economies. Bottom-up methods offer some advan-
tages for dealing with transitional economies in that they
focus on the physical stock of equipment and apply scenarios
for its evolution, with less concern for anticipating macroeco-
nomic equilibrium conditions. However, just as top-down
models are constrained by lack of reliable data for these
economies, the data on current equipment end-use energy ef-

For purposes of the analysis, the transition economies were
divided into two regions: the countries of the former Soviet
Union (FSU) and the Eastern European countries in transition
(EET). Figure 9.13 displays the carbon taxes required to
achieve stabilization in cach region. The former Soviet Union
and Eastern European countries have zero taxes before 2010.
This is because the stabilization constraint is nonbinding.
With price reforms and the removal of energy subsidies, there
is a decline in emissions relative to 1990 levels. For the
GREEN model, the emission constraint begins to bite shortly
after 2010. For 1!2RT. emissions remain below the 1990 level
until 2040.

A comparison of emission reduction cost studies reveals strik-
ing differences with the results of some top-down models (see
Table 9.17), On the bottom-up side, a number of studies have
been completed by Eastern European and Russian experts
since the transitions of 1989. Some of this work was con-
ducted using the U.S. EPA End-Use Energy Model, whereas
others applied indigenous country-specific models. The EPA
model projected future energy demand to the year 2030 in
five-year increments, giving results for the major fuel types
and future aggregate industrial energy intensity. The model
estimates energy demand on the basis of economic growth,
structural change. price response, and technical energy-
efficiency improvements not attributed to price response. Like
that of Makarov and Bashmakovy (1991), most of the bottom-
up studies incorporated economic restructuring as a driving
force for determining the energy content of economic growth.

choice of top-down versus bottom-up models (see Figures

The most energy-intensive economies in the world are the
planned or postplanned economies (Chandler er al., 1990).
However, a short digression on the meaning and importance
of energy intensity in the formerly planned economies may be
in order. Energy intensity (energy consumed per unit of eco-
nomic output) is an important. if controversial, indicator of
future emissions. This value is difficult to measure accurately
because GNP is difficult to quantify in comparable units.
Also, differences in economic structures may be significant.

One area in which macroeconomic models are particularly

cent study, the OECD used the GREEN model to analyze the
impact of subsidy removal in China and India (OECD, 1994).

include taxes and subsidies, revenue recycling, international
trade, allocations for rch and development, and backstop

the frameworks to deal better with the unique characteristics

interpreting their results. With these caveats in mind, we now

Of the developing countries, China has received the greatest

"Note that all models report very large GDP losses for
China under the stabilization scenario. This is because the
emissions growth under business as usual is much higher for
China compared to the world as a whole. Hence, China re-
quires especially large emission cuts. In Scenario I, absolute
cuts in emissions will be required in the industrialized coun-
tries, whereas a low growth in emissions is allowed for China.
Hence, the GDP losses for China (in percentage terms) are
somewhat lower. Although figures are not reported for ROW
due to the heterogeneous nature of this region, the study indi-
cates that the GDP losses are also very high for ROW under
both scenarios. Among other things, the OECD study under-
scores the importance of the emission allocation scheme in
determining costs to individual countries. This issue will be

costs in these countries. The studies indicate a tendency for
the energy intensity of economic growth to decrease, primar-
ily as a consequence of structural economic change and tech-
nological development. In contrast, however, the studies
generally expect the CO, intensity of primary energy con-
sumption to increase more or less as a direct outcome of the
introduction of commercial fossil fuels as a major source of
energy supply in future baseline development. The overall re-
sult is that the CO,/GDP intensity is close to unity for most of
the studies. The policy implication of these trends is that the
studies indicate a potential for implementing low-carbon en-
ergy technologies. but a special effort seems to be necessary
to reverse the strong tendency for fossil fuel energy technolo-
gies to become the major source of supply in the future.

"The elasticities of primary energy to GDP, CO, emissions
to primary energy, and CO, emissions to GDP are shown in
Table 9.21 for the reference or baseline scenarios. Many of the
countries have a primary energy/GDP elasticity between 0.6
and 0.8, implying that a 1% increase in GDP leads to a 0.6-
0.8% increase in energy consumption. This value, which is
low if one considers current trends in developing countries, is
explained in the individual countries in part by national eco-
nomic development plans that include structural changes and
technical efficiency improvements. However, the CO,/GDP
elasticity is close to unity for most of the country studies as a
consequence of high expected CO,/energy elasticities. This
latter elasticity reflects development processes in which tradi-
tional local biomass and also hydropower resources are
“squeezed out” while commercial fossil fuels are expected to
play a larger rote. A remarkably high CO,/energy elasticity is
projected in the UNEP Brazil study and in the studies by David-
son for Ghana, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone, where biomass is
substantially replaced by fossil fuels in the reference scenario.

The emissions develop more slowly in the low emission
scenarios of the LBL study than in the UNEP study, even
though reductions in the scenarios are less extensive than in
the UNEP studies. The LBL studies are typically focussed
around a 20-30% reduction from the reference scenario in
2025. This reflects the lower economic growth rate projec-
tions of the LBL study. The lowest projections are seen for
Brazil and Argentina, where the emissions are projected to in-
crease by only about 50% from present levels. Another group
of countries, including China, Mexico, and Venezuela, is pro-
jected to have emission levels two to three times higher than
present levels after reductions of 20-30% from the baseline
scenario. India and Indonesia are projected to have persis-
tently high emission levels.

sion reduction costs for two emission reduction scenarios, one
reflecting a least-cost emission reduction case and the other a
“capital-constraint” case with more emphasis on domestic re-
sources. The least-cost case requires foreign capital and re-
sources. The other emission reduction scenario assumes a
more expensive supply system with greater reliance on do-

case estimates average emission reduction costs in 2025 to be

As an example, a summary of the main technical emission
reduction options in the UNEP country studies is presented in
Table 9.23. The national options are listed in aggregated form
and thus represent classes of options rather than individual tech-
nologies. The cost curve may be considered in three segments,
representing negative and low-cost options, intermediate-cost
options, and high-cost options. One general similarity among
the country studies is that the least expensive part of the cost
curve contains energy end-use savings in households and/or in-
dustry. Another is that electricity supply options first appear in
the intermediate-cost part of the reduction potential cost curves.

The emission reduction costing studies for developing coun-
tries considered here exhibit similarities with regard to the as-
sessed potential for negative or low-cost emission reduction.
In general, these options comprise end-use efficiency im-
provements, energy supply efficiency improvements, and the
introduction of fuels with lower carbon intensity. These tech-
nologies cover the first and cheapest part of the emission
reduction potential and can, especially in the longer term.
be supplemented with renewable energy technologies, more
far-reaching end-use savings, and advanced combustion
technologies. The long-term emission reduction potential will

The degree of optimism of experts from different countries
with regard to the penetration of energy efficiency or of car-
bon-free energy supply options may differ dramatically. This
can lead to different critical assumptions in the baseline as
well as in the emission reduction scenarios. One approach is
to assume that all possible efficiency improvements will be
implemented as part of the baseline scenario, implying that
only positive-cost options remain. If the existing energy sys-
tem - as in many developing countries at present — is rela-
tively inefficient. the above-mentioned approach implicitly
assumes large investment programmes to implement the “effi-

positive costs, but the size of the model-based cost estimates

on the assessment of abatement costs. These studies are im-
portant for several reasons. The enhanced greenhouse effect is
inherently a global issue. If significant reductions in emis-
sions are required, they can be accomplished only through in-
ternational accords and cooperation. It will be helpful to have
some sense of the overall costs before confronting the diffi-
cult issue of burden sharing.

A systematic comparison of global models was undertaken by
the OECD in its 1992 Model Comparison Project (OECD,
1993). The study included all available global models with the
capability of simulating regional carbon tax rates required to
achieve specific emission abatement targets and the resulting
output losses. The models were calibrated to the same set of
input assumptions employed by the parallel study being con-
ducted by the Energy Modeling Forum (see earlier discus-

First. notice that the costs of stabilizing emissions at 1990
levels (approximately 6 billion tonnes) are lower in 2000 than
in later years. The increase in emissions over the present
decade is relatively small and there are ample quantities of
low-cost substitutes (¢.g.. natural gas and demand-side man-
agement) to achieve the objective.

Conversely, ERM projects the lowest baseline emissions
for 2020. As a result, less carbon must be removed from the
energy system to achieve emission stabilization. Even so, esti-
mated costs (in terms of resulting output losses) are higher
than those projected by CRTM since ERM does not include
backstop technologies, thus producing higher marginal costs
of emission abatement.

In a separate experiment, it was determined that ERM and

average annual rate of 0.5%, whereas ERM assumed that non-

The OECD Model Comparison Project suggests that the
principal reason why model-based studies differ with respect
to estimates of both baseline emissions and abatement costs is
alternative views about the future characteristics of the energy
system embodied in the models. In an attempt to place greater
reliance on expert knowledge in this area, Manne and Richels

parameters to which abatement costs are particularly sensi-

9.2.5.1.2 The costs of meeting alternative emission targets

In addition to the emission stabilization scenario, the OECD
project examined three alternative scenarios in which the
growth rate of emissions in each region is reduced below that
of the corresponding baseline by one, two, and three percent-
age points respectively. Figure 9.25 plots global GDP losses
as a function of worldwide emissions. Although there are sig-
nificant variations in cost estimates across models, the results

The global baseline, however, is not the sole determinant of
global abatement costs: The GREEN baseline projects the
highest emissions for the year 2020; hence it requires the
largest annual reductions to stabilize emissions at their 1990
level. Yet this does not lead to the highest cost estimates. This
is because GREEN is the most optimistic of the four models
concerning the speed at which backstop technologies can be
introduced into the energy system.

These opportunities may be exploited through a system of
international trade in carbon emission rights or a global car-
bon tax. Emission rights trading would allow for a more effi-
cient allocation of emission reductions across regions by
letting countries trade to the point where the marginal cost of
emission reduction is the same in all places and activities, 4
global carbon tax would also result in the marginal cost of
emission reduction being equal for all countries.

The analysis suggests that the emission time path may be
as important as the concentration level itself in determining
the costs of emission abatement. Time is needed both for an
economical turnover of the existing capital stock and to de-
velop and deploy low-cost carbon-free alternatives.? The most
cost-effective emission time paths are those which provide the
greatest flexibility in managing the transition away from fos-

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change has as its ultimate objective the “stabilization of
greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that
would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the
climate system.” The question of what constitutes an appropri-
ate concentration level is likely to remain the subject of intense
discussion for some time. But there is little disagreement over
a subsequent clause in the Convention — that “policies and
measures to deal with climate change should be cost-effective
so as to ensure global benefits at the lowest possible cost.”

"For comparison, two reference scenarios were used as a
high and low projection case for CO, emissions, namely the
IPCC 1991 scenario as the high alternative and an average of
the U.S. EPA’s “Rapidly and Slowly Changing World” cases
as the low alternative (IPCC 1992a; Lashof and Tirpak, 1990).
Emissions for these reference scenarios for the year 2100
range between 22.6 PgC for IPCC 91 and [7.7 (PgC) for the
EPA. These reference scenarios are shown in Table 9.26, to-
gether with the policy scenarios of the FFES study and the
EPA “Rapid Reductions” policy scenario. CO, emissions de-
crease to zero in the year 2100 in both these intervention
cases.

The fact that deferring reductions may lead to lower costs
should not be interpreted as supporting a “wait and see” or
“do nothing” strategy. Part of the savings stems from not hav-
ing to turn over the existing carbon-intensive capital stock
prematurely. If we are to depart from the business-as-usual
path, however, it is important that the new capital stock be
less carbon-intensive. This means that energy sector decision
makers must commit to a less carbon-intensive infrastructure
when making new investments. Second, new supply options
typically take many years to enter the marketplace. To have
sufficient quantities of low-cost substitutes in the future will
require a sustained commitment to research and development
today.

The reasons why results differ so widely are not entirely
clear. Manne and Oliveira-Martins (1994) have attempted a
systematic model comparison of results from 12RT and
GREEN. They find that much of the differences in leakage
rates reported by the two models can be explained by different
assumptions concerning the response of trade flows to
changes in comparative advantage and competitiveness en-
tailed by a regional carbon tax. Other key determinants of the
extent of carbon leakage are the size and composition of the
region undertaking unilateral abatement action, the supply
elasticities of different fossil fuels, and the elasticity of sub-
stitution between energy and primary inputs of labour and
capital in the production process in participating and nonpar-
ticipating regions. The model comparison needs to be ex-
tended to include other models, particularly those that show
extremely high rates of leakage. before firm conclusions con-
cerning the leakage effects of unilateral abatement actions can
be drawn.

The high expectations for the contribution of solar and

way, a breakthrough is expected for electricity: production
costs for wind power, providing an opportunity for utilizing

The high contribution of renewables in the FFES scenario
is in contrast to the conclusion of an extensive analysis of
renewable energy potential by the World Energy Council
(1994). This analysis estimates that renewable energy re-
sources would supply about 50% of total energy by 2100 in
the so-called “ecologically driven scenario,” which is the
most far-reaching CO, reduction case in the study. It is argued
that the total potential for renewable energy could be larger et
that time, but if renewables make a major contribution and en-
ergy growth is low over a long period. as assumed in the eco-
logically driven scenario. supplies of petroleum and natural
gas will still be available and it will be beneficial to mix dif-
ferent sources in the e supply system.

"These LESS scenario results support the suggestion that
the disagreement in the numerical outcomes of the models, in
the very long run, is due less to the modelling structure than to
the exogenous hypotheses. From a decision-making point of
view, however, the most sensitive issue that remains to be ad-
dressed is the plausibility of this long-term transition, if one
accounts for all the general equilibrium effects (for example,
the implications of shifting agricultural activities to fuel pro-
duction) and for all the transaction costs involved in the tran-
sition. It is worth noting, however, that the World Energy
Council's ecologically driven case, which includes less volun-
taristic assumptions than the LESS scenarios, points to a 60%
reduction in global energy-related CO2 emissions from 1990
levels in 2100. This scenario is buttressed by a very compre-
hensive study of renewable energy prospects out to the year

"The LESS scenarios provide estimates of the potential for
greenhouse gas emission abatement using data developed
from the detailed technology assessments in the Working
Group IIa assessment process (IPCC, 1994). The energy sup-
ply systems were constructed from work by both bottom-up
(Lashof and Tirpak. 1990; Johansson et al., 1993) and top-
down modellers (Edmonds, Wise, and MacCracken, 1994). In
the bottom-up variant, the starting point is energy demand
projections by world regions for 2025, 2050, 2075, and 2100
developed by the Response Strategies Working Group (RSWG,
1990) as part of the IPCC 1990 Assessment Report. A high
economic growth version of this scenario demonstrated the
importance of technology assumptions in the LESS analysis.
Global GDP grows eight-fold by 2050 relative to 1985 and
twenty-eight-fold by 2100, with primary energy consumption
growing from 323 EJ in 1985 to 559 EJ in 2050 and 664 EJ in
2100. Biomass, mostly for fuels used directly, plays a major
role. It accounts for 31% of primary energy in 2025 and rises
to 50% in 2100 in one version of the scenario.

Studies have also shown a wide range of estimates of land
costs. As discussed in Chapter 8, this factor has proved partic-
ularly difficult because of the many nonmarket considerations
associated with the social cost of converting between land
uses, Because of the difficulty of determining the appropriate
figures, some studies simply have not included land costs as
an element of the cost analysis (e.g. Dixon. Schroeder, and
Winjum, 1991). Others have apparently assumed that the use
"	Text
"of land is costless because it is either public land (New York
State, 1991) or because the wood products will eventually pay
for the land (Van Kooten et al., 1992; Xu, 1994). As might be
expected, those that have included land costs have arrived ata
wide range of estimates for that variable. Table 9.28 provides
a summary of the land cost data employed in the various stud-
ies. Note that several of the studies that provide estimates cf
land availability do.not include cost figures.

Initial treatment costs (see Table 9.29) are generally ex-
pressed as a capital outlay. whereas the maintenance costs. if
included, are expressed as annual costs. Land costs may be
expressed as either annual costs (rent) or capital costs. The
cost analysis is facilitated by summarizing these costs as ei-
ther a net present value equivalent or an equivalent annual
cost. The key factor for this operation is the discount rate ap-
plied to these costs. Table 9.30 summarizes the discount rates
used by various Sequestration cost studies.

"The range of estimates of land availability for the temper-
ate areas is only slightly narrower. Adams er al. (1993), Moul-

that there may be 100 x 10° to 115 x 10° ha of marginal agri-
cultural land suitable for afforestation in the U.S. alone. How-

planting Loblolly pine on agricultural land in the Southeast

levelization/discounting approach. The one exception is Van
Kooten et al. (1992), and they complement their flow summa-

Nordhaus, 19916), Sedjo and Solomon (1989) do not provide
unit cost calculations of carbon sequestration, whereas Norc-

be surprising in light of the fact that they do not include land
costs in their estimates. The difference can be attributed in

Hardie recognize much less land availability than either
Adams et al. (1993) or Richards er a/. (1993). This means that
they move into more expensive land very quickly. Also, as in-
dicated by Tables 9.28 and 9.30, their annual land costs are es-

yield estimates and include only tree carbon in their calcula-

nualized over only a [0-year contract period. Although this
may be appropriate for their analysis of a specific hypotheti-

"narrow range. After accounting for the differences attributable
to cost analysis methods, Moulton and Richards (1990) pro-
vide the lowest cost range ($9 per tonne to $41 per tonne of
carbon captured). These estimates were subsequently revised
to reflect refined (lower) carbon yield estimates, the elasticity
of demand for agricultural land, administrative costs, and fail-
ure rates (Richards er al. 1993). The analysis by Adams et al.
(1993), which is based on a method of imputing land values
through consumer welfare loss derived within a mathematical
programming model of the agricultural sector, tends to con-
firm the revised results. Both studies suggest that the marginal
cost of carbon sequestration would range from $9 to about
$65 per tonne of carbon captured (levelized cost basis). The
New York State (1991) study is in close agreement with the
previous two studies.

Opportunities in the most northern latitudes appear some-

across all practices, suggest that only 2 GtC can be accumu-

At the other extreme, Sedjo and Solomon (1989) provide
land and treatment cost figures that would suggest a cost of
carbon sequestration of $7 per tonne on a cost levelization ba-
sis and $3 per tonne on a flow summation basis. This rela-
tively low cost estimate is due to their optimistic assumption
regarding carbon yield, which is based on growth rates in the
Pacific Northwest and Southeast regions of the U.S. Applying
these rates to a global analysis is probably unrealistic, but it
does suggest that, at least in some regions, carbon sequestra-

land can be secured, 2.9 Gt of carbon per year can be removed
from the atmosphere in forest plantations. This is nearly one-
half of current annual global levels of carbon emissions. At
the other extreme, Nordhaus (1991b) suggests that an average
of only 0.28 GtC per year can be captured over a period of 75
years, even in the presence of a global effort. The difference
between these two estimates is almost entirely due to the esti-
mates of carbon yields, since their assumptions on land avail-

"The three studies of individual developing countries pro-
vide an interesting contrast. Whereas Masera ef al. (1994)
estimate that carbon sequestration on forest plantations in
Mexico would cost $5-$11 per tonne, Xu (1994) calculates
that carbon could be stored on plantations in China at a nega-
tive cost. The latter result stems from the fact that Xu includes
revenues from the sale of forestry products in the cost calcula-
tions, and that China has a largely unmet demand for timber.
The interpretation of cost figures for Ravindranath and So-
mashekhar (1994) is unclear. Although they apparently use a
flow summation approach in their cost calculations, they do
discuss the application of discounting, at zero and 1%, to the
carbon flow, which would suggest a levelized cost method.
Their costs range from $0.09 to $2.78 per tonne.

In the temperate regions there appear to be significant op-
portunities. Richards ef al. (1993) suggest that in the U.S.
alone, an aggressive tree planting programme could yield an
average of 0.4 GtC per year for 100 years and a cumulative to-
tal of 49 GtC if the plantations are undisturbed for 160 years.
Dixon, Schroeder, and Winjum (1991) are not so optimistic.
That study suggests that across all forestry practices a total of
20 GtC could be accumulated in the entire temperate zone.
Over their 50-year analysis period this averages to 0.4 GtC
per year. Because the estimate of land area availability in
Dixon, Schroeder, and Winjum (1991) is much higher than in

"This discussion has suggested that there is significant varia-
tion among the studies with respect to their estimates of the
unit costs and potential amounts of carbon sequestration. The
studies also differ in how they present the results. Several of
the reports (Sedjo and Solomon, 1989; Nordhaus, 1991b;
New York State, 1991; Van Kooten ef al., 1992) have pre-
sented their results as point estimates, that is, as estimates of
the costs of achieving a specified amount of carbon sequestra-
tion.” Other studies have developed cost curves that illustrate
the increasing marginal cost of carbon sequestration as a func-
tion of the level of sequestration (Adams et al., 1993; Moulton
and Richards, 1990; Dixon, Schroeder, and Winjum, 1991;
Parks and Hardie, 1995; Richards et al, 1993). The cost
curves provide information that is not conveyed in either
point estimates or in the ranges of unit costs listed in Table
9.35.
"	Text
"First, Nordhaus uses average carbon yield factors derived
from the review of greenhouse gas policy options conducted
by the U.S. EPA (1989). These figures are for carbon yields on
average commercial timber land and probably substantially
underestimate yields expected from conversions of marginal
agricultural land to forestry plantations (see Table 9.31 for a
comparison with other studies). Second, the analysis limits
the total cumulative carbon to a range of 30-50 tonnes/ha and
assumes that this amount occurs over a forty-year period fol-
lowing plantation establishment. These figures are certainly at
the low end of the expected carrying capacity of forest plan-
tations (see, e.g., Dixon, Schroeder, and Winjum, 1991).
Finally, to portray the timing of carbon capture, Nordhaus ap-
plies a logistic growth curve that has the effect of delaying
carbon uptake relative to the rate given by the average-flow
approach or the MCS approach. Combined with a levelization
approach to costs, this delay in carbon uptake contributes to
an increased unit cost of carbon capture. (Richards er al.,
1993, also captures this effect.)

Figure 9.35 illustrates the total cost for carbon sequestra-
tion under a 160-year programme. The total cost rises almost
linearly over the range of 12 to 5S billion short tons of carbon.
This implies that the average cost per ton of carbon stored is
roughly constant over this range. A constant average cost
means that the marginal cost per ton of carbon stored is also
constant and is equal to the average cost. Thus, Figure 9.35
confirms the relatively constant marginal cost over this range
shown in Figure 9.34.
"	Text
"Other studies report the marginal cost of carbon sequestre-
tion differently. Marginal costs are sometimes expressed in
nominal dollars, that is, the dollars of the year in which the se-
questration occurs. To arrive at this figure, current costs are
levelized (inflated) at the discount rate. Carbon sequestration
can also be measured as tonnes of carbon accumulated and
permanently stored. Marginal cost curves that use either or
both of these procedures tend to have a shape that is very sim-
ilar to the curve in Figure 9.34 despite the significant underly-
ing ¢ differences in the meaning of the values.

practices can reduce methane emissions per unit of product by

where animals have not experienced large changes in pro-
ductivity in the preceding decades, the animals are currently
eating poor quality forage. product markets and physical in-
frastructure exist, and traditions and customs will support the
changing practices. In particular, dairy herds in many devel-
oping countries offer great potential because the current diets
are nutrient-deficient, there is daily access to animals so that
feed supplementation and other management practices are
possible, and the increased production of milk is quickly seen
and marketable. Globally, emission reductions of 4-10 Tg per

"Nitrous oxide is produced as a waste gas during the produc-
tion of adipic acid, which is used primarily in the manufacture
of nylon. The production of nitric acid — mostly for fertilizer
production, with a small percentage used as an input into
adipic acid production — also produces nitrous oxide. These
sources are estimated to emit about 0.4 to 0.6 TgN and 0.1 to
0.3 TgN as N,O per year, respectively (IPCC, 1992b). Over
80% of these emissions are from the industrialized countries.
Emissions of nitrous oxide from adipic acid production al-
ready reflect a 30% emission abatement from the use of re-
ductive furnaces to reduce emissions of NO, (RIVM. 1993).
Reductive furnaces reduce emissions by about 98%. A num-
ber of additional options for reducing these emissions with
similar reduction efficiencies are under study by the adipic
acid producers, some of whom expect to have these technolo-
gies in place by 1996. Emissions of nitrous oxide from nitric
acid production are not currently abated, and technologies for
reducing these emissions do not appear to be under discus-

using application methods that reduce the loss of nitrogen. Al-
though these alternatives need substantial development and
demonstration before becoming widely available, the poten-

an annual basis because, even though almost 100% of manu-
factured HFCs will be emitted to the atmosphere eventually,
emission rates can vary from low but long-term (as in the case
of insulating materials) to instantaneous (as in the case of
aerosol propellants), Currently, emissions of these gases are
relatively small, but emissions can be expected to grow sub-
stantially over the next decades as HFCs are increasingly used
as substitutes for CFCs and HCFCs. The U.S., for example,
expects more than a doubling in these emissions between
1990 and 2000. A number of options for reducing emissions
of these gases are being investigated. Options include process
changes, substitution of other substances, recycling, and de-
struction. The U.S. expects to reduce emissions of HFCs by

The production of aluminum is thought to be the largest
source of emissions of two PFCs, CF, and C,F,. These emis-
sions are produced primarily by anode events, which occur
during the reduction of alumina in the primary smelting
process. World emissions are highly uncertain and are esti-
mated to be in the order of 30,000 tonnes per year and 3000
tonnes per year for CF, and C,F,, respectively (Cook, 1995).
Approaches for reducing emissions focus on technological
upgrades for highly inefficient smelters and practices for re-
ducing the frequency and duration of anode events at more
modern smelters. These practices include improved algo-
rithms for controlling automated processes. better manage-
ment of alumina additions, and improved training for per-
sonnel. Because aluminum smelters are large consumers of
energy, the costs of these modifications can be largely offset
by the costs of saved energy. The U.S. estimates that it can re-
duce PFC emissions from aluminum smelting by 30-60% by
2000 by promoting profitable changes in current practices

Historically, the most common approach to integrated as-

research teams to integrate the information available from
the relevant disciplines and provide policy advice in books
and reports. Although this has typically been accomplished
via informed qualitative linkages, Integrated Assessment Mod-
els (IAMs) use a computer program to link an array of com-
ponent models based on mathematical representations of in-
formation from the various contributing disciplines. This
approach makes it easier to ensure consistency among the as-
sumptions input to the various components of the models, but
may tend to constrain the type of information that can be

Keeping in mind the uncertainties and limitations inherent
in these models, they can nevertheless be used to compute op-
timal control strategies. Specifically, results relating to opti-
mal CO, emission control rates (percentage reductions in
emissions relative to baseline emissions) and carbon taxes
(equivalent to the marginal cost of efficient carbon emission
reductions) over the next century vary widely, in part because
of debates about the nature and valuation of climate impacts
and in part because of debates about how to represent the dy-
namics of energy systems and technology development
processes. However, the models do agree that higher control
costs, lower damage estimates, and higher discount rates lead
to lower initial optimal control rates, whereas lower control
costs, higher damage estimates, and lower discount rates lead
to higher initial control rates. For example, if new technology
development is highly responsive to the level of control,
lower control costs will result over time and a higher initial
optimal control rate will be implied. Conversely, break-
throughs in biotechnology that would be expected to reduce
the damages resulting from climate change on agriculture
would (other things being equal) reduce the optimal initial
control rate.

"Policy evaluation IAMs are comprehensive, process-based
models that attempt to provide a thorough description of the
complex, long-term dynamics of the biosphere-climate sys-
tem. The dynamic description often includes a description
of atmospheric chemistry, climate, and ecological impact
processes as well as a number of geophysical and biogeo-
chemical feedbacks within the system. Some of the models
even deal with biosphere-climate dynamics at a geograpically
explicit level. On the other hand, the socioeconomic system in
these models is usually poorly represented. The larger models
usually do not serve the purpose of performing cost-benefit or
cost-effectiveness analyses, but they can provide insights into
the intricate interrelationships between the various compc-
nents of the human system and the biosphere-climate system.
Ideally, such insights can lead to new priority setting in the
analysis of the climate change process. Policy evaluation
IAMs provide a useful framework for identifying, illuminat-
ing, and clarifying current uncertainties. The most important
uncertainties can be compared and ranked, and then the model
can show how they propagate through the whole human/cli-
mate/biosphere system.

Integrated assessments are no stronger than the underly-
ing natural and economic science that supports them.
Nevertheless, by bringing many components of the cli-
mate change problem into a common framework, they
offer potentially useful insights that would be unavail-
able from a purely disciplinary research programme. In
applying these assessments to climate policy design,
two critical factors should be noted. First, researchers
should provide a measure of the confidence with which
such policy assessments can be made; and, second, the
models should indicate the distribution across countries
and income levels of impacts associated with particular
policy goals and implementations.

Recent refinements to Integrated Assessment Models
show increased diversity in the distribution of regional
costs and benefits. This implies potentially greater diffi-
culty in reaching agreements but also opens up the pos-
sibility of greater gains in global welfare from achiev-
ing them.

From the integrated assessment perspective, there are
important gaps in disciplinary research and inconsisten-
cies between the information produced by the various
disciplines whose reconciliation would lead to im-
proved integrated assessments. Much of the underlying
fundamental science needed to develop coordinated in-
tegrated assessments is not in a form suitable for imme-
diate use. Different disciplinary experts, for example,
have held different factors constant. This contributes to
the difficulty of developing, calibrating, and validating
the models. In addition, some of the underlying funda-
mental research has not been performed. For example,
models of adaptive decision making do not yet explic-
itly consider how social goals and progress towards
them are measured over time or how global change
processes are detected. Finally, there are some highly

uncertain components in the current set of integrated as:
sessments, including the sensitivity of the climate sys-
tem to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations, the
physical and economic impacts of any climate change
that may occur, and the applicability and choice of dis-
count rates. One of the main values of the integrated as-
sessment approach to the study of climate change lies in
the identification of gaps and inconsistencies in our
knowledge of the underlying phenonema and their im-
plications for future research.

Although it is difficult confidently to choose one policy
in preference to others based on current knowledge
about the climate system and human interactions with it,
it has been demonstrated that the policy objective, dis-
count rate. and timing of compliance can be critical to
short-term policy formulation and the overall cost of ac-
tion.

Given the considerable uncertainties associated with
how the climate system will evolve and interact with
human activities, policies that enhance the flexibility of
nations and individuals to respond to any impacts that
do emerge tend to have high value. Because they can
be focussed directly on the impacts of climate change,
research and development activities related to technolo-
gies and institutions that facilitate the process of adapta-
tion to climate change generally have a high payoff.
Research and development activities directed towards
technologies that lower material use in economic activ-
ity are also a good bet.

Most current models do not match the social and eco-
nomic organization of the developing economies well.
For example, none of the existing models can incorpo-
rate hierarchical decision structures or represent the op-
eration of the informal economies that are important in
many developing countries. This can lead to biases in
global assessments when impacts in developing coun-
tries are valued as if these countries were no different
from developed countries.

Finally, climate change is but one dimension of global
change. For example, integrated assessments suggest
that ecosystem impacts from projected climate change,
agriculture management, and urbanization could well be
of similar magnitudes.

Third, integrated assessment can help to address the most
fundamental policy question about global climate change:
How important is it relative to other matters of human con-
cern? Gaining insight into this question will require compar-
ing the aggregate social effect of climate change and potenti:
responses to it with the aggregate social effect likely to arise
from other changes and risks over the same period of time.

"Second, by providing a coherent, systematic framework to
structure present knowledge, integrated assessment can bring
two important benefits: It can promote a broad view of the cli-
mate issue that may facilitate more systematic searching for
possible responses and avoid prematurely settling on one or a
few proposed responses; and it can provide a consistent repre-
sentation of current uncertainties, permitting identification
and prioritization of those that are most important in practical
terms — that is, those uncertainties that are most important to
reduce in order to understand what should be done. Since the
most important uncertainties from the perspective of policy
relevance will not necessarily be the most important for ad-
vancing basic understanding, this function of integrated as-
sessment can be of the highest importance.

"Integrated assessment can in principle serve three purposes,
First, integrated assessment can help assess potential re-
sponses to climate change, by (1) representing physical, eco-
logical, economic, and social processes to project the conse-
quences of climate change and of particular policy responses
to it, (2) using a cost-benefit formulation to compare costs
of responses to the severity of the impacts they are intended
to prevent, or (3) using a cost-effectiveness formulation to
compare the relative effectiveness and cost of different re-
sponses to meet a specified target. Whichever of these for-
mulations is employed, integrated assessment performs this
function by making consistent, contingent, appropriately qual-
ified projections of the likely cost and effect of specified
responses.

dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.
It also stated that this goal should be realized soon enough that
ecosystems could adapt naturally to climate change, that food
production would not be threatened, and that sustainable eco-

On the other hand, most policy audiences are likely to need
less broadly integrated assessments. This may be so even for
assessments to inform international negotiations, if, as often
happens, a preexisting political commitment either to a simple
heuristic principle like the precautionary principle or to a spe-
cific numerical policy target truncates the consideration of re-
sponses (Parson and Zeckhauser, 1995; Levy, 1993). In such
cases the most useful assessment may be to adopt a cost-effec-
tiveness approach, comparing emission types, sources, gases,
and regions, to determine feasible. low-cost ways to meet
specified abatement goals (see, e.g.. Read, 1994b). However,
integrated assessment models can also be used to test the cost-
effectiveness or welfare implications of those principles.

Such assessments, though, are not the only kind that can be
useful, or necessarily the most appropriate for informing
many specific policy decisions. Certain international deliber-

that are integrated even more broadly. At this level. it may not
be possible to address the climate issue without making judg-
ments of its significance relative to other environmental and
policy issues. To engage choices of this breadth, assessments
may be required that facilitate comparing the potential im-
pacts of climate change and other issues. End-to-end assess-
ment of climate change may be a necessary component of
such assessments, but it may not by itself be sufficient. For

Integrated assessment may also be of interest to small coun-
tries or regions that may suffer climate impacts but have little
or no influence over global emissions. For authorities in such
jurisdictions, the crucial dimension of integration will be
across dimensions of impact — sector, location, group, and time
— under an illustrative set of climate change scenarios. This
type of assessment could inform their decisions about long-
term climate-dependent investment. emergency response mea-

"An area of active current exploration is the development of
global-scale climate assessments with “end-to-end” integra-

measures with impacts and adaptation measures. Such proj-

ing of the climate issue to shed light on decisions about
optimal global emission abatements and efficient means of
achieving them. The implied audience for such assessments
consists of those decision makers with the authority to bal-
ance the extent and form of abatement measures, adaptive and
compensatory measures, and possibly geoengineering mea-
sures. Assessments of this kind are likely to help improve the
general understanding of appropriate responses to the climate
issue. Broad balancing of abatement and adaptation measures
will be done, implicitly or explicitly. and it is clearly desirable

Formally modelled integrated assessment studies trace their inspiration, if not their precise methods, to the global models
of the 1970s, such as Meadows ef af. (1972) and Mesarovic and Pestel (1974). (This field was reviewed in Meadows et al.,
1982.) These highly aggregated dynamic models of world development included generalized representations of pollution
and resource depletion but did not address any particular environmental issue.

Formal integrated assessment models of climate change emerged in the late 1970s from earlier economic and technical
models of energy policy. Nordhaus (1979) presented the first model that combined energy conversion, emissions, and atmo-
spheric CO, concentration, Subsequent efforts in integrated assessment of climate change that stressed formal modelling in-
cluded the ITASA energy project (Hiifele et af, }984), Nordhaus and Yohe (1983), which added uncertainty to modelled pro-
jections of future C 0, concentrations, and Edmonds and Reilly (1985).

Through the 1980s, climate assessment studies using formal integrated modelling were narrower in scope than those us-
ing interdisciplinary expert panels. The modelled assessments normally extended no further than atmospheric CO, concen-
tion, excluding both non-CO, greenhouse gases and resultant changes in climate and impacts. A separate line of work,
beginning with the MINK project (Rosenberg and Crosson, 1991; Rosenberg, 1993) focussed specifically on climate im-

The first integrated assessment of a global environmental issue was the Climatic Impacts Assessment Program (CIAP).
conducted by the U.S. Department of Transportation to assess the environmental impacts of stratospheric flight by super-
sonic aircraft (Grobecker ef af, 1974), Six separate interdisciplinary expert teams examined one link in a causal chain
stretching from human activities (scenarios of supersonic flight and jet engine design) through atmospheric chemistry and
radiation to biological, economic, and social impacts. The teams exchanged numerical estimates of key quantities, ulti-
mately yielding quantitative estimates of the environmental and economic impacts of specific scenarios of stratospheric
flight.

Through the 1970s and early 1980s, several other major integrated assessments were conducted using a similar structure
of interdisciplinary expert panels. Early assessments of global climate change that helped lay the groundwork for the present
IPCC approach included Clark (1982) and the U.S. National Research Council (1983). This comprehensive, interdiscipli-
nary approach, which does not centrally depend on formal modelling, continues to the present in such bodies as the Assess-
ment Panels of the Montreal Protocol and the IPCC itself. Since CIAP, however, no assessment has attempted such a
precise, comprehensive integration of processes, from human activities to valued consequences, without using a formal in-

Full-scale IAMs must consider the issue of emissions of
greenhouse-related gases. The array of gases that matter from
the perspective of emissions differs slightly from the array of
gases that matter from the perspective of climate. From the
perspective of climate change only, the set of gases and parti-
cles that have the capacity to change the radiative balance of
the planet needs to be considered. At present the set consists
principally of the following: water vapour (HO), ozone (O,).
carbon dioxide (CO,), methane (CH,), nitrous oxide (N, 50).
sulphur aerosols, and the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and

greenhouse-related gases such as carbon monoxide (CO).

These systems are strongly interactive. Some models han-

actions of natural system emissions, the status of unmanaged
ecosystems, hydrology. ground cover, crop, and forest pro-
ductivity. Other models treat them as if they were indepen-
dent. The managed biosphere interacts strongly with human
systems, which determine the selection of crop and managed
forest species and the allocation of water resources among
competing ends. Interactions between ecosystems and the cli-

"The second information set that a full-scale IAM must gener-

model must translate from both natural emissions and the
emission flows generated by human activities. Greenhouse
gas concentrations also depend on natural sources and sinks.
In general, greenhouse gases can be segregated into CO, and
other gases. The non-CO, greenhouse-related gases are con-
trolled by atmospheric processes. Their sinks are predomi-
nantly in the atmosphere. CO,, on the other hand, is governed
by the processes of the carbon cycle. The concentration of

In addition to the degree of complexity (including disag-

major design consideration in an integrated assessment model

uncertain; future greenhouse gas emissions, given population
and economic activity, are uncertain; future greenhouse gas
concentrations. given emissions, are uncertain; future climate,
given atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, is un-

There are two broad classes of integrated assessment mod-
els: policy evaluation models that project the physical, eco-
logical, economic, and social consequences of policies and
policy optimization models that optimize key policy control
variables (e.g.. carbon emission control rates or carbon taxes)
given formulated policy goals such as maximizing welfare or
minimizing the cost of meeting a carbon emission or concen-
tration target. There are two general types of policy evaluation
models: deterministic projection models, in which each input
and output takes on a single value, and stochastic projection
models, in which at least some inputs and outputs are treated
stochastically. Policy optimization models can be divided into
three general types: models that optimize responses, given
targets for emissions or climate change impacts; models that
seck to balance the costs and benefits of climate policies; and
models of sequential climate decision making under uncer-
tainty. Each approach has strengths and weaknesses, and each
produces particular insights regarding climate change and po-
tential policy responses to it. Some of the more advanced
models can be used for several of the above purposes.

emerged, Table 10.1 lists twenty-two integrated assessment
models that are in active use or under active development; in
addition, a number of other modelling efforts are underway, so
the number of existing integrated assessment models might be
expected to at least double in the next few years. Even within
the group of models listed in Table 10.1, though, there is a
wide variation in level of model maturity. Some models are
fully operational and documented, Others are up and running

module development and testing phases, with some modules
not yet fully specified. It is anticipated that all the models
shown here will be fully operational, albeit in preliminary ver-

Policy optimization IAMs focus on balancing the marginal
costs of controlling greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to
any climate change impacts that may occur with the damages
that result after implementation of the mitigation and adapta-
tion policies. These models reflect the strict cost-benefit para-
digm discussed in Chapter 5. In this approach any constraint
on human activities is explicitly represented and costed out.
At present, models of this type include highly aggregated rep-
resentations of climate damages, generally representing eco-
nomic losses as a function of mean global surface tempera-
tures but sometimes disaggregating these losses into market
and nonmarket damage components.? However, as additional
research on climate change impacts proceeds, it may be deter-
mined that these measurements are inaccurate. Moreover, it
may be difficult to get policymakers to implement policies
based on aggregate damages, as they are more likely to be
able to relate to impacts on particular countries, regions. or
sectors (e.g., agriculture or biodiversity in tropical rain
forests) which are not explicitly represented in the current
cost-benefit type of integrated assessment models. Early mod-
els of this type were also so complicated that it was difficult to
incorporate explicit representation of uncertainty (and risk
aversion) within the model structures. As discussed below.

The advantages of using integrated assessment models of
climate change in estimating GWPs are twofold: (a) they can
calculate GWPs for each conceivable scenario, so the influ-
ence of the emission scenario selected can be stated explicitly:
and (b) they also deal with the rates of change of all kinds of
targeting processes, so the cumulative effect can be combined
with the rate at any time. The results show that the GWPs cal-
culated with integrated assessment models differ from the
ones previously published by the IPCC. Considering a time
horizon of 100 years, the difference might be as much as 5-
10%. This difference demonstrates the crucial role of the cho-
sen scenario in calculating GWPs and cannot be addressed by
analytical methods.

"As discussed at length in Volume 1 of this report, the presence
of sulphate aerosols in the atmosphere is now thought to have a
strong local cooling effect. This effect is manifested through
three pathways: scattering and absorption of shortwave (solar)
radiation, cloud reflectivity, and cloud persistence. By incor-
porating a simplified mathematical expression of the rela-

integrated assessment models, some of the sulphate aerosol el-

the climate system to simultaneous changes in SO, and CO,

over the next decade, it is conceivable that the increased radia-

offset reductions in radiative forcing due to reduced CO, emis-

The IMAGE 1.0 model (Rotmans, 1990) was used by the
IPCC to analyze delayed policy response options in which the
start of the international policy response was delayed to 2000,
2010, 2020, and 2030 respectively. It was calculated that de-
laying implementation of the “Control Policies” scenarios by
10 years would result in only a minor increase in global mean
temperatures, but that it would require a reduction of global
CO, emissions of 20% with respect to year 2000 levels,
whereas starting immediately would require only a 5% reduc-

"In 1989, a U.S.-Netherlands expert group of the IPCC was
asked to develop four different pathways for future global
emissions of co,, CH,, N,O, halocarbons, and the ozone pre-
cursors NO, and CO. The expert group used two alternative
integrated assessment models to construct these scenarios: the
ASF model from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
and the IMAGE 1.0 model from the RIVM, the Dutch Na-
tional Institute of Public Health and Environmental Protection
(Rotmans, 1990). Three scenarios were designed in such a
way that they would lead to a doubling of the CO,-equivalent
concentration in the atmosphere in the years 2030, 2060, and
2090. These were referred to as the “Business-as-Usual,”
“2060 Low Emissions,” and “Control Policies” scenarios, re-
spectively. The fourth scenario, the “Accelerated Policies”
scenario, leads to stabilization of the CO,-equivalent concen-
tration in the atmosphere at well below doubling of prein-
dustrial concentrations. Each scenario is based on a set of
assumptions for key factors, including population growth,
economic growth, the costs of technology used to convert en-
ergy from one form to another, energy end-use efficiency lev-

ultimate goal of the UN Framework Convention on Climate

terms of the Convention, mitigation costs are to play a limited

the other hand, are related to temperature change, which re-

house gases with a long lag, whereas atmospheric concen-

because of the large stock and long lifetimes of greenhouse
gases already in the atmosphere. Thus, the marginal costs of

Richels and Edmonds (1995) have examined the question
of cost-effectiveness in achieving a particular concentration
target. They found that the emission timepath can be as impor-
tant as the concentration level itself in determining the ulti-
mate price tag. Specifically, they examined alternative emis-
sion profiles for limiting CO, concentrations to 500 ppmv in
the year 2100. Employing two widely used energy-economy
models (the Edmonds-Reilly model and Global 2100). they
found that emission timepaths involving modest reductions in
the early years followed by sharper reductions later were less
expensive than those involving substantial reductions in the
short term. A similar conclusion can be found in Kosobud er

Mitigation costs are a more important consideration in de-
termining how the target is to be achieved. The Convention
states that “policies and measures to deal with climate change
should be cost-effective so as to ensure global benefits at the
lowest possible cost.” A particular concentration target can be
met in a variety of ways. For example, Figure 10.3(a), drawn
from the IPCC Synthesis Report, shows trajectories for stabi-
lizing CO, concentrations at 450, 550, 650, 750, and 1,000
ppmv. Figure 10.3(b) shows two alternative emission paths for
reaching each of the four lowest CO, concentrations. Some
ways of meeting concentration targets will be more costly
than others. Integrated assessment modelling can help iden-
tify emission paths that minimize the costs of meeting a pre-
specified concentration level (see Chapter 9).

"finds that the overall benefit-to-cost ratio for aggressive ac-
tion limiting carbon emissions to 4+ Gt is a favourable 1.3.
Thus, Cline endorses a much more aggressive control policy
than calculated in most of the other pure cost-benefit studies.
Much of the difference in results stems from Cline’s assump-
tion of risk aversion on the part of national and international
policymakers and his use of a zero rate of pure time prefer-
ence, whereas the other studies generally employ a pure rate
of time preference of about 3 and no risk aversion by
poligymakers. In fact, Cline has shown that the optimal con-
trol rate in 2100 in the DICE model would be 50% if'a zero rate
of pure time preference is employed as opposed to the 15% re-
ported for the 3Ce rate of time preference in the DICE baseline.
Moreover, as discussed below, Nordhaus (1994) reports that the
pure rate of time preference is the input to which DICE results
are most sensitive. The subject of the appropriate rate of pure
time preference is a major focus of Chapter 4 of this report.

Several factors argue for drawing more heavily on the
budget in the early years. With the economy yielding a
positive return on investment, emission reductions in the
future will be cheaper than emission reductions today.
That is, a smaller amount of today’s resources needs to
be set aside to finance them. As a result, the same level
of cumulative emission reductions can be achieved at a
lower total cost to society. In addition, slowing the tran-

Another type of sensitivity analysis involves focussing on a

recent analysis of carbon-free advanced energy technologies
was performed by Edmonds ef a/. (1994b). In this study the im-
plications of advanced energy technologies (including very low-
cost biomass fuels) for greenhouse gas emissions and
temperature change were investigated. Obviously, the introduc-
tion of very low cost noncarbon fuels leads to lower carbon
emissions and less temperature rise in the long run (post-2050}.
A somewhat surprising result of this analysis, though, is an in-
crease in temperature prior to 2050 as the replacement of car-
bon-based fuels with carbon-free fuels leads to a reduction in
sulphur emissions and, therefore, fewer climate-cooling sulphur
aerosols in the atmosphere. Lower sulphur emissions. however,
would produce benefits in the form of reduced acidic deposition.

"pacts in the future. Thus, a number of precautionary invest-
ment analyses have started to appear in the literature. One
innovative example is the analysis, based on a stochastic
optimization model, that is included in Chapter 4 of Buying
greenhouse insurance: The economic costs of CO, emission
limits (Manne and Richels, 1992). This analysis deals explic-
itly only with the cost of CO, emission reductions, but it is as-
sumed that U.S. decision makers must act initially without
knowing what ultimate limit on carbon emissions will emerge
from further scientific research and international negotiation.
However, it is assumed that by 2010 it will be revealed
whether (1) no limits will be necessary, (2) a 20% emission
reduction will be required, or (3) a 50% reduction will be re-
quired. Each of these future policy outcomes is assigned a
probability of occurrence. This formulation makes the idea of
hedging against a range of future outcomes explicit, with the
initial control rate and carbon tax for the optimal hedging
strategy (the one that maximizes the expected future utility of
consumption) lying between the maximum control and no-
control strategies, and with the exact level depending on the
probabilities assigned to the different control outcomes. Put
differently, there is a risk premium associated with emitting
carbon, owing to the fact that carbon emissions may be con-
strained (and possibly severely constrained) in the future.

The way land is used is a key determinant of the net emis-
sions and accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmos-
phere and of the impacts of climate change. However, land
use and land tenure decisions in the developing countries will
be driven by development goals and local pollution concerns
rather than climate change concerns over at least the next sev-
eral decades. Therefore. it is important to track trends in land
use and land tenure in order to project the contribution of the
developing countries to global climate change and how they
will be affected by any changes that might occur. Only a few
of the operational integrated assessment models (e.g., Aleamo,
1994; Morita e7 al/., 1993) track land use at all, and even those
models are limited by lack of good data regarding current land
use patterns in the developing countries, as well as a lack of
understanding about who controls land use decistons at pres-

"A major problem in attempting to analyze and value climate
change impacts is that the projections from most general cir-
culation models, until recently at least, have been based on a
hypothetical steady-state situation (a doubled-CO, climate).
In reality, however, greenhouse gas concentrations are not
steady and will not necessarily stabilize at a level equivalent
to a doubling of preindustrial CO, concentrations. Moreover,
there are uncertainties about many elements of these projec-
tions, especially at a regional level. The process of projecting
transient regionalized changes in the key climate variables —
such as temperature and precipitation — that lead to impacts on
economies and ecosystems is in its infancy and is thus a
source of additional uncertainties. Furthermore. the climate
information required to most effectively project the impacts
has in many cases not yet been determined, nor have the most
appropriate measures of climate impacts, and ecosystems may
not currently be in equilibrium, Finally, it may be necessary
for this information to be analyzed using valuation methods
that are still under development and not tightly linked to the
impacts on natural systems in order to provide policymakers
with the information they need to decide what to do.

Related to the issue of separability is the question of selec-

other major environment and development problems? The
TARGETS model (Rotmans ef a/., 1994) is the first to make
such an attempt at integrating these issues. This model tries to
address the concept of sustainable development from a world
perspective, covering the global issues of human health and
demographic dynamics, energy resources, global element cy-

discussion of the secondary benefits of emission control in

A further general problem of modelling, but one that is par-
ticularly relevant in the analysis of global change issues, in-
volves the need to consider the consequences of discontinu-
ous climatic or ecological responses. Inputs to IAMs reflect
the world as we know it or as we might expect it to evolve, but
climate change may bring surprises. Large uncertainties in our
knowledge add to the need to consider discontinuous syste.
responses. Atmospheric physics and chemistry seem to react
relatively smoothly to external changes. However, ecological
and, to some extent, economic responses could potentially be
quite discontinuous. In a full uncertainty analysis, low proba-
bility events, such as the drying up of the U.S. corn belt.
should be considered. The difficulty with such events, how-
ever, is that they are unprecedented and therefore hard to
model.

"Another important issue im mtegrated modeiing rs the
compatibility of the many modules included in the model,
each reflecting the modelling approaches and abilities of a
distinct set of disciplines. A comparative static model, de-
scribing the difference between two equilibrium states (char-
acteristic of many climate and climate impact models run to
date), cannot readily be tied to a dynamic model like those
used to project economic activity and carbon emissions, But
even two dynamic models can work on two entirely different
timescales; for instance, larger economic models are at best
seasonal whereas general circulation models operate in time
steps of tens of minutes. Spatial scales can also differ, not
only in resolution, but also conceptually, Economists, for in-
stance, tend to think in terms of nations and geopolitical re-
gions, whereas ecologists think in terms of habitats and life
zones. A third difference is the degree to which models ap-
proximate the real world. Normative models. which describe
how systems should operate (a paradigm reflected in some
economic models) cannot be easily integrated with descrip-
tive models of how the world actually operates (common in

 

 

climate and ecological modelling). The compatibility issue is
at present being dealt with through trial and error. Continued
feedback with the mother disciplines is required to ensure that
modules are not used or changed in an inappropriate manner.

"A number of approaches to integrated assessment of climate

human activities, make it impossible to know exactly what to

advantage to the use of multiple research teams pursuing a

"is the eventual aim of integrated assessment, it is not a trivial
matter. The majority of the problems obviously arise from the
immature state of the current generation of models. Most cur-
rent models, for example, do not give insight into income dis-
tribution or employment issues. Nonmarket impacts can be
included only after having been econometrically valued, thus
implying substitutability. Economic models of the costs of
emission controls often consider only market-based instru-
ments and assess only efficiency. As others have argued in this
report, policymakers tend to have a broader outlook that em-
braces more than economics. On the other hand. integrated as-
sessment models that are more biased towards the natural
sciences provide a weaker representation of the societal forces
driving emissions and impacts. Evaluation and optimization
are often not represented. In addition, some models calculate
changes on the basis of potential rather than actual outcomes
without considering transitional problems.

A coalition of nations may choose one or a mix of policy
instruments, including tradable quotas, feasible forms of joint
implementation, harmonized domestic carbon taxes, interna-
tional carbon taxes, nontradable quotas, and various interna-
tional standards. At both the international and national levels,
market-based approaches are likely to be more cost-effective
than other instruments.

"At the international level, all the potentially efficient tax or
quota solutions should be available to facilitate future negotia-
tions. Under a harmonized carbon tax, incentives exist for coun-
tries to alter related policies to reduce the domestic implications
of the tax (for example, by introducing offsetting production
subsidies), This possibility could make harmonized carbon
taxes | effective than tradable quotas in reducing emissions.

In principle, individual countries can choose from among a
large set of available instruments, including carbon taxes,
tradable permits, deposit refund systems, and subsidies, as
well as technology standards. performance standards, product
bans, direct government investment, and voluntary agree-
ments. A choice of tradable quotus at the international level
would provide maximum flexibility for instrument choice at
the domestic level.

The world economy and individual national economies
suffer from other distortions than those possibly leading to
global climate change. Any of these may prevent economies
from attaining efficient outcomes. In many cases, correcting
for those other distortions would lead to actions that would
also serve to reduce the expected damage from climate change.
Plainly, such distortions should be corrected, and many gov-
ernments are already taking steps to do so.

For a global treaty, a tradable quota system is the only po-
tentially cost-effective arrangement where an agreed level of
emissions is attained with certainty (subject to enforcement).
The initial quota allocation could provide a means of compen-
sation to countries — particularly developing countries — that
would bear substantial costs in implementing international re-
sponse measures. This attribute would provide the opportu-
nity to encourage developing countries to participate actively
in global action.

To effect a substantial reduction in net greenhouse gas
emissions, such as would be required to stabilize atmospheric
concentrations, requires policies expressly designed to mit-
igate global climate change. The associated policy instru-
ments must be identified at two different levels: those that
might be used by a coalition of countries and those that might
be used by individual nations unilaterally or to achieve com-
pliance with a multilateral agreement on greenhouse gas
emission targets.

"A clear distinction needs to be drawn between the costs and
benefits of actions taken to reduce the impacts of climate
change and the costs and benefits of actions taken to reduce
emissions. The first involves a consideration of adaptation
policies such as developing new drought-resistant plant culti-
vars, whereas the second involves a consideration of policies
designed to mitigate climate change. The final policy mix
adopted by countries is likely to contain both adaptation and
mitigation policies.

"A tradable quota or permit system has the disadvantage of
making the marginal cost of emission reductions uncertain,
whereas a carbon tax has the disadvantage of leaving the level
at which emissions will be controlled uncertain. The weight
given to the importance of reducing these different types of
uncertainty will be crucial in determining the final choice be-
tween competing market-based instruments. Regardless of the
final mix of instruments adopted, there will remain a high de-
gree of uncertainty about the physical effects of different lev-

"The consequences of climate change policy will be deter-
mined by the choice of the mix of policy instruments, the
design and implementation of those policies, and the institu-
tional framework in which the policies must operate. For ex-
ample, regulatory instruments are likely to have a different
impact on innovation than market-based instruments. Further-
more, the welfare effects of a carbon tax or the government

instruments. Among these criteria are efficiency or cost-
effectiveness, effectiveness in achieving stated environmen-
tal targets, distributional (including intergenerational) equity.
flexibility in the face of new knowledge, understandability to

flect a desire on the part of governments to achieve other ob-

levels indirectly related to greenhouse gas emissions. Govern-
ments may also be concerned about the effects of policy on

The second key feature of the greenhouse problem is that
both the extent of any climate change and the nature of its ef-

to learn about evolving climatic and economic conditions

Greenhouse policy assessment must therefore take into ac-
count the existence of opposing risks. Indeed, one important
avenue for policy assessment is to examine the extent to
which policy can be directed to reduce the costs of uncertainty
and the costs of risk from natural damage caused by the en-
hanced greenhouse effect and from mitigation measures in re-
sponse to climate change concerns. An immediate response to
the greenhouse problem is to invest in research and develop-
ment to reduce greenhouse uncertainties and subsequently to
provide new information to decision makers.

lag, up to fifty years, between emission reductions and their
impact on atmospheric concentrations. Thus, the greenhouse
problem is a pollution problem over space and time, and one
in which increased absorption can reduce atmospheric con-
centrations of greenhouse gases as effectively as reduced
emissions. Any benefits from controlling concentrations will
depend on long-term global cooperation, and the costs of col-

An efficient greenhouse policy would ensure that the costs
of greenhouse uncertainties, and of associated risks, and the
costs of emission reductions and adaptation strategies are bal-
anced, at the margin, with the benefits from avoiding damage
from global warming. One implication of this efficiency crite-
rion is that the optimal policy is the one that achieves a global
greenhouse target at least cost in the face of risk, uncertainty.

the effects and extent of climate change will remain.

"A basic principle in public policy (as for any financial deci-
sion) is to time the introduction of the policy to maximize the
expected discounted value of the stream of net benefits from
the initiative. In this context, there may be benefits from wait-
ing to reduce uncertainties before implementing greenhouse
policies.’ The value of the information gained from waiting
could allow greenhouse policy to be properly tailored to the
most likely damage scenario in order to avoid excessive con-
trol costs (Peck and Teisberg, 1993; Leary and Scheraga.
1994; Richels and Edmonds, 1994). Conversely, there could
be significant costs in waiting, if waiting makes excessive
damage costs more likely (Chichilnisky and Heal, 1993) or re-
sults in the need for urgent action at some future time, with as-

"The aim in this chapter is to provide an economic assessment
of possible policy instruments for managing greenhouse gas
emissions under the Framework Convention on Climate
Change (FCCC). The Framework Convention contains sev-
eral key guidelines for policy implementation. First is the
emphasis given to the need for developed countries to dem-
onstrate that they are taking the leading role in policies to con-
trol greenhouse emissions. In essence, developed country
signatories (as listed in Annex 1 of the Convention) have ac-
cepted the goal, but not necessarily the requirement, of sta-
bilizing greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by 2000
(Article 4.2). In ratifying the Convention, Annex [ countries
have effectively accepted a quantitative emission target, al-
though the level of that target remains uncertain, Developing
country signatories (non-Annex countries) are under no such
obligation. Rather, the economic needs and special circum-
stances of developing countries (Articles 4.8 and 4.10), and of
countries highly dependent on incomes from fossil fuels (Ar-

One way of controlling activities that both directly and indi-

to regulate the activities of firms or individuals. By mandating
standards, governments attempt to ban or alter the use of ma-

are typically applied in areas such as buildings (energy effi-

"Under an emission-trading scheme, emitters are given per-
mits to emit (the total allocation is the aggregate emission
cap for the country) and have the option of buying or selling
permits in the marketplace. Although there are important and
often subtle differences between taxes and tradable permits,
under some restrictive circumstances the outcome can be the
same. Both may target full user-cost pricing of the atmo-
sphere to dispose of net greenhouse gas emissions from
human activity. When traded on a national market, permit
prices are established that show the costs of marginal emis-
sions, just as an emission tax does. The difference is that the
tax is exogenous (in this case, set by the government) and its
effects on emissions endogenous, whereas emissions are ex-
ogenously determined in the case of a permit system and,
hence, permit prices are endogenous.

"Under an emission tax. those who produce emissions face a
tax per unit of emissions.4 All fossil fuels should be taxed at
the same rate per unit of their long-term global warming po-
tential. A tax on energy content measured in British thermal
units, the so-called BTU tax, would not satisfy this criterion,
as it relates to energy use per se rather than to any externali-
ties associated with end products of combustion (see Poterba,
1993). A tax on the carbon content of fossil fuels, on the other
hand, would approximate this criterion. Implementing such
taxes at a uniform rate per tonne of carbon content of fossil
fuels to curtail carbon emissions assumes that existing ex-
cises on energy products are levied at the optimal level based
on minimizing the excess burden of taxation and internaliza-
tion of environmental externalities. If such an assumption
does not hold in practice, the design of carbon taxes becomes
more complicated.

A tradable-permit system could be used in combination
with either an international tradable-quota system or an inter-
national carbon tax. In the former case, the domestic permit
system could either be integrated with an international quota
system, where the permit-liable parties (say, a limited set of
wholesale fossil fuel dealers) trade directly on the interna-
tional quota market (see Grubb and Sebenius, 1991; Sandor et
al., 1994) or be run as a separate subsystem providing the na-
tional government with a net excess demand for (or supply of)
emission quotas at the ruling international quota price. In the
case where governments paid an international tax on carbon
emissions, it would be up to cach government to determine
beforehand the volume of domestic permits available per pe-
riod. Ideally, this volume should be such that the resulting
permit price would be equal to the tax rate. If not, nationally
as well as internationally, too little or too much abatement
would take place.

other market distortions) may also have indirect consequences
for greenhouse gas emissions. Changes in migration policies

arise as a consequence of changes in the incidence of occur-

If global carbon taxes were levied as producer taxes in-

fossil fuel producer countries instead of consumer countries
and, hence, would shift the burden between the two types of
countries (Whalley and Wigle, 1991). The distributional ef-

participating countries would likely rise. A policy instrument
might then be introduced by the latter countries to control car-

In the case of a domestic carbon tax imposed by interna-
tional agreement, the national commitment to impose the tax
will also vary because perspectives on global warming vary
from one country to another. If a country has signed such an
agreement under international pressure, that country could
make the carbon tax ineffective by reducing existing energy
taxes, by taxing substitutes for fossil fuels (for example, hy-
droelectricity), by providing subsidies to complements or
products that are fossil-fuel-energy intensive, and by lax en-
forcement of the tax (see Hoel, 1993). Thus, by following a
suitable strategy, a free ride becomes possible. A global car-

It is conceivable that uniform standards could be established
among countries participating in an international emission re-
duction agreement. But it is likely to be difficult to achieve
wide agreement about any large set of specific instruments of
this type. For example, individual countries may adopt stan-
dards for housing insulation, but it is most unlikely that the
same standards would be applicable in both temperate and
tropical countries. Moreover, such an approach would fimit
the domestic policy choices of individual countries and.
hence, their flexibility in adjusting their emissions under an
international greenhouse gas reduction agreement. Another
regulatory approach involves agreements by countries on
fixed national emission levels (a “nontradable emission quota”
system), much in the tradition of the European Union's Large
Combustion Plants Directive, which specifies reductions in
the emissions of sulphur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen from
plants with a thermal rating of 50 MW or larger. Such an ap-
proach would mean that marginal emission abatement costs
among patticipating countries would tend to be different and,
hence, total abatement costs. globally speaking. would be un-
necessarily high.

"The use of the available policy instruments will only lead to a
cost-effective global outcome if certain conditions are met.
First, unless individual countries undertake cost-effective do-
mestic greenhouse policy measures that are compatible with
the goal of global efficiency, the policy instruments adopted
internationally will not lead to that goal. Each individual
country is free to choose its own instrument or combination of
instruments to meet its international obligations, but the
choice of international instruments will, to some extent, dic-
tate the choice of policy instruments at the domestic level.
This is clearly so in the case of the harmonized carbon/energ
tax proposed by the European Commission for member states
of the European Union. Under this regime, every member of
the Union would impose the same tax rate, although states
would be free to decide for themselves what to do with the
revenues from the tax. H nations themselves were taxed by an
international agency, it would not necessarily follow that na-
tions would choose to impose the same tax domestically. For
example, they might instead choose to reduce emissions do-
mestically by means of a tradable permit scheme. Similarly, in
the case of a system of internationally tradable quotas, indi-
vidual countries might choose to implement their obligations
by means of a domestic tradable permit scheme or through a
domestic emission tax.

"Perhaps surprisingly, uncertainty with respect to the bene-

If the marginal abatement cost curve is known, then choice of
a tax will result in a known quantity of emissions and choice
of a quantity of tradable quotas will result in a known quota
price (under the usual assumptions). This means that the out-
come in terms of both emissions and marginal cost can be de-

In an important paper, Weitzman (1974) showed that un-
certainty with respect to the costs of abatement does affect the
choice between these instruments if the goal of policy is to
maximize the net benefits of abatement. A substantial litera-
ture in the context of environmental policy followed, includ-
ing major works by Adar and Griffin (1976), Yohe (1977), and
Watson and Ridker (1984). Where there is uncertainty about
abatement costs, use of tradable quotas will guarantee that
emissions do not exceed the quantity of quotas allocated (as-
suming full compliance), irrespective of the costs of doing so.
Conversely, an emission tax would guarantee that marginal
abatement costs did not exceed the magnitude of the tax, no
matter how large or small was the resulting level of emissions.
What Weitzman shows is that. if the marginal benefit and
marginal cost curves are linear, the two instruments will be
equivalent only if the slopes of these curves are equal (in ab-
solute value terms). If the marginal cost curve is steeper than
the marginal benefit curve, emission taxes will result in a
more efficient outcome. Conversely, if the slope of the mar-
ginal cost curve is less than the slope of the marginal benefit
curve, then tradable quotas would be preferred.

that governments seek to minimize the costs of meeting this tar-

1976). Under a mixed system, a certain quantity of quotas
may be made available. In addition, both a tax and a subsidy
are imposed, with the tax being higher than the subsidy. If
costs turn out to be higher than expected, polluters may pay
the tax instead of purchasing more costly quotas. The tax thus
serves to cap marginal abatement costs. If, on the other hand,
costs turn out to be lower than expected, polluters can reduce
their emissions even further in order to obtain the subsidy.
The mixed system performs better than either pure system un-

refers to the economic unit responsible for meeting a target.
Options range from the level of the country to that of individ-

The coverage issue in the case of CO, has been widely dis-

One major question relates to whether consideration should
be limited only to changes in emissions of CO,, or whether it
should also include changes in CO, sinks, such as expanding
forests? Another concerns whether and how an international
agreement might help retard deforestation and promote refor-
estation (Dudek and LeBlanc, 1992). Deforestation could be
treated as equivalent to emissions. whereas afforestation ac-

It is also necessary to take into account any distortions

environmental damage (see Binswanger. 1989). Another im-

government failures play a role. For example, high rates of

complete and backed by verification (OECD, 1992b). Further.
such a price stimulus for reduced deforestation (and increased

The above observations about distortions are important be-
cause many analyses of climate change policy assume that the
externality of climate change is the only distortion that exists.
In fact. climate change policy must be considered in the con-
text of real economies, already rife with distortions. A market
economy can function effectively only if governments define
property rights and provide for the enforcement of contracts.
In some countries, even these basic requirements are not met.
The extent to which governments can provide these basic re-
quirements and correct market failures will in part determine
GNP. (The importance of GNP, and other economic and social
factors, in determining future emissions is highlighted in
Chapter 8.)

"From the basic theorems of welfare economics it can be de-
duced that if an economy is perfectly competitive, if there is a
full set of markets, and if information is perfect, then the re-
sulting equilibrium (if it exists) is efficient in the sense that no
one could be made better off without making someone else
worse off (Pareto efficiency). The real world does not satisfy
these conditions. There exist many externalities, of which cli-
mate change is only one. Competition is not perfect, nor in
many cases is information, and markets are not complete.
What is more, even if all the conditions of perfect competition
were satisfied, the resulting Pareto-efficient outcome might
not accord with society’s view of a distribution of resources
that is equitable or “fair.” If certain other conditions hold, then
an alternative, feasible. Pareto-efficient allocation could be
sustained as a competitive equilibrium with appropriate lump-
sum taxes and transfers, and so the objectives of efficiency
and equity need not necessarily clash. But lump-sum taxes

distorting taxes and transfers are employed virtually every-

differences reflect the opportunity costs of alternative land
uses (Stavins, 1995b) as well as the effects of uncertainty (see
Sedjo, 1994, and the references cited there). However, esti-
mates at the low end of the range refer to developing countries
and, aside from: the Limitation of uncertainty, appear promis-

free backstops further into the future. According to current
estimates, such backstops become economic when the mar-

Empirical work dating back to Hausman (1979) shows that
purchases of energy-saving technologies often reflect high
rates of discount (see Treadwell ef al, 1994),!9 In other words,
purchasers of such technologies may insist on earning a
higher rate of return on this investment than on alternative in-
vestments. In an econometric analysis, Hassett and Metcalf
(1992) show that future uncertainty regarding energy prices,
due to past volatility in those prices. can attribute a large op-
tion value to waiting before investing in energy-conserving
capital. On the other hand it could be argued that uncertainty
about future energy prices creates an incentive to invest in en-
ergy-efficient equipment to minimize the share of energy
costs in total costs. This would reduce risk exposure if energy
prices were more uncertain than other input prices.

developed and developing countries. In the U.S.. for example.
government regulation frequently restricts electricity prices
from privately owned utilities to a level equal to long-run av-
erage costs, which are often below marginal costs. Power is
sold by the federal government at approximately 25% be-
low even these levels, because of interest and tax subsidies

(Schramm, 1992). In 80% of developing countries, electricity
prices are. on average, 30% below long-run marginal costs

expenditure on new capacity. failure to generate sufficient in-

The direct impact on government revenue of the two policies
can be made equivalent across a variety of cases. No direct
impact on government revenue would occur if permits were
grandfathered (that is, allocated on the basis of some histori-

all shoreline property less than 50 cm above sea level will be
lost. Alternatively, it might be assumed that there will be some
adaptation — that dikes might be built, for example. The latter
response is indeed a cost of climate change: It would not need
to be taken in the absence of climate change. However, the
response may reduce the damage associated with climate
change. If the reduction in such damage exceeds the costs of
adapting. then adaptation should be undertaken (Fankhauser,
1993).

The reduction of virtually any distortion is to be encour-
aged, provided equity concerns can be safeguarded. Policy
reforms that help in this regard are therefore also to be
welcomed, whatever the consequences for climate change. If
greenhouse gas emissions are reduced as well, then extra po-
tential gains exist. But even where this is not so, the removal
of distortions can lead to greater economic welfare. In gen-
eral, such policies should not be linked directly to climate
change policy. However, their significance for climate change
policy needs to be recognized, and the prospects of “double
dividends” from carbon taxes or tradable permit systems can
give the extra political impetus needed to reduce existing dis-
tortions. These policies will influence both the “business-as-
usual” emission scenario and the effectiveness of any climate
change policy.

It is important to draw a clear distinction between the costs
and benefits of actions taken to reduce the impacts of climate
change and the costs and benefits of actions taken to reduce
emissions. The first reduces the potential damage caused by
climate change directly, whereas the second has the effect of
reducing emissions of greenhouse gases now, which, in turn,
will have an impact on future climate. Examples of adaptation
include such actions as increasing irrigation water availability
in regions where the climate has become drier, improving re-
frigeration to offset the effects of a warmer climate, and relo-
cating economic activities away from the coast where sea
levels have risen. Measuring the cost of adaptation is some-
what problematic, given that both ecosystems and economic
systems are changing all the time and will to some extent
adapt autonomously to climate change.

emissions should not be linked to global climate change pol-

policy, it seems that such linkages may nevertheless be made.

Any adaptation policies should be designed in concert with
miligation policies. Both types of policies are aimed at mini-
mizing the expected damage from climate change, Adaptation
will be undertaken up to the point where the damage avoided
by an incremental increase in adaptation equals the associated
incremental cost. Abatement will be undertaken up to the
point where the reduction in damage effected by an incremen-
tal unit of abatement equals the incremental cost. However,
the two types of policies are not entirely equivalent. First, the
benefits of adaptation are likely to be felt much more quickly
than the benefits of mitigation, and, second, some types of
adaptation policies will not be subject to the same problems of
free riding (see Section 11.6.5) as abatement. For example, if
a country defends its shoreline by building seawalls, its own
population, in most cases, will receive all the benefits. This is
not true of unilateral abatement.

Although uniform technology and performance standards
may be effective in achieving established environmental goals
and standards, they typically lead to economicaily inefficient
outcomes in which firms use unduly expensive means to
control pollution (Tietenberg, 1985; Hahn, 1989; Hahn and
Stavins. 1991), Because the costs of controlling pollution vary
greatly among and even within firms, any given aggregate
pollution control level can be met at minimum aggregate con-
trol cost only if pollution sources are controlled at the same
marginal cost, as opposed to the same emission level. Indeed,
depending on the age and location of emission sources and
available technologies, the cost of controlling a unit of a given
pollutant may vary by a factor of 100 or more across a range
of sour (Crandall, 1984). Nonetheless, because perfor-
mance standards give economic agents additional flexibility
to make choices based on economic criteria, performance-
based standards will generally be more cost-effective than
technology-based standards. On the other hand, if there is es-
sentially only a single means of achieving a particular perfor-
mance standard, a technology-based standard may save on
information and administration costs.

they are relatively easy to monitor and enforce. An inspector

that are not fully developed (Jochem and Gruber, 1990). The
problem with this approach, however. is that while regulators
can assume that some amount of improvement over existing
technology will always be feasible, it is impossible to know
just how much. Standards must either be made unambitious or
else run the risk of being ultimately unachievable, leading to
political and economic disruption (Freeman and Haveman,

Under some circumstances, however, a performance stan-
dard may provide greater incentives for technological adop-
tion than a marketable permit system (Malueg 1990). There
are better and worse ways of establishing performance stan-
dards. To take an example, the Corporate Average Fuel Econ-
omy (CAFE) standards in the U.S. are applied to the fleet
average of every manufacturer and importer. CAFE may thus
be binding on a manufacturer that sells many larger cars as
well as some small cars, but not on a manufacturer that sells
only small cars. The problem here is that the former manufac-
turer may sell small cars that are more energy-efficient than
the latter manufacturer. In other words, the innovation and
manufacture of more efficient automobiles may not be re-
warded by these standards. If CAFE differentiated the stan-
dards according to the market segment of each vehicle
(sub-compact, compact, mid-size, etc.), then firms that sold
vehicles that were more efficient for their class than required
by the standard would be rewarded by not having to pay the
penalty for which the manufacturers of less efficient cars were
liable. Better still, if manufacturers were allowed to trade in
energy efficiency credits, then even the manufacturer of the
most efficient cars would have a continuous incentive to
develop even more energy-efficient cars. Finally, a tax on
gasoline (petrol) would not only provide incentives for the
manufacture of more fuel-efficient cars, but would also pro-
vide incentives for vehicle owners to reduce their fuel con-
sumption.

Literature on the effects of demand-side management pro-

draulic or natural gas units could be shifted to periods where it
is supplied by coal-fired units, resulting in a net increase in
emissions (Faruqui and Haites, 1991; Haites, 1993). Never-

expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Indeed, some

One criterion applied to these programmes is the Rate Impact

gramme to reduce costs more than revenues. Programmes that
the RIM test lead to lower rates immediately and are at-

on the Total Resource Cost (TRC) test, which measures the
aggregate benefit to all customers. A programme that passes
the TRC test but fails the RIM test (and most fall into this cat-

Although the initial incidence of a greenhouse regulation
will fall on greenhouse-intensive energy users, the final inci-
dence will depend on the ability of firms to pass the costs of
the regulation to others through higher prices for goods and
services, and these distributive impacts are likely to differ
over time. For example, over the the long run the application
of increasingly strict greenhouse pollution controls to newer
cars might be regressive (i.e., with costs falling disproportion-
ately on the poor), as low-income earners face substantial in-
creases in used car costs; in the short run, though, low-income
earners might gain a relatively larger capital reward on selling
their cars (Tietenberg, 1992). Where the costs of regulation
are regressive. compensatory transfers may be used, funded
from a specific tax or general government finances, or the reg-
ulation might be modified, exempting some individuals from

"Any greenhouse policy will have distributional effects on
firms and households. Regulations impose quantity limits on
the use of particular inputs or outputs in production and con-
sumption activities. The direct cost of regulation is the reduc-
tion in profits and consumer welfare due to the regulatory
constraint on choice. The distribution of this cost is often hid-
den, but that does not make it unimportant. For example,
poorer households tend to own appliances that are cheaper to
purchase but more costly to run. That is, poorer households
tend to make appliance purchasing decisions reflecting higher
effective individual discount rates (Hausman, 1979). A regu-
lation that required all households to purchase more efficient
appliances would thus disproportionately affect the poor, even
though by outward appearances it might seem not to. To the
extent that regulation is not a least-cost option to control
greenhouse emissions, the excess burden it implies must also
be distributed. However, with quantity limits — whether in the
form of conventional regulations or tradable permit systems —
individual emitters do not face an environmental cost for
emissions that are less than the limit. This is in contrast with
the distributional consequences of a system that taxes all

emissions.

Thus, it may be possible to introduce clauses into a future

carbon removal from emissions. This would, in effect, be

a tax/subsidy scheme - where nations would be credited
for certified carbon removal (estimated carbon emissions
avoided) by equally large additions to their emission quotas.
These quotas would be measured by the carbon content of fos-
sil fuel use, equal to production plus imports minus exports.
Moreover, if fossil fuel use is taxed domestically (directly or
indirectly through a tradable permit system), and carbon re-

with general deposits (taxes) on CFCs and a refund when and
if CFCs are recovered, provided that the transaction costs of
such a system are not prohibitively high (Stavins, 1988:

emissions will be very limited. Still, the problem of CFCs re-

A carbon tax is a more efficient instrument for reducing en-
ergy sector CO, emissions than taxes levied on some other ba-
sis, such as energy content of fuels or the value of energy
products (ad valorem energy tax). For example, model simu-
lations of the U.S. economy indicate that an energy tax could
be between 20 and 40% more costly, and an ad valorem tax
two to three times more costly, than a carbon tax for equiva-
lent reductions in emissions (Scheraga and Leary, 1992; Jor-
genson and Wilcoxen, 1992). This is because an energy tax
raises the price of all forms of energy, whether or not they
contribute to CO, emissions, and would make it more costly
to substitute lower-emitting or nonemitting energy sources for
high-emitting energy sources. As a corollary, a combined car-
bon/energy tax would be less efficient and more costly than a
pure carbon tax, due to its energy tax component.

"Currently, potential emitters of CO, — purchasers of fossil
fuels for combustion, for example — do not have the option of
choosing to remove the carbon from emissions.?3 On the other
hand, new techniques for carbon removal may eventually be-
come economically feasible. (In 1993, for example, Japan's
Ministry of Trade and Industry launched a project on CO, fix-
ation — see MITI, 1993.)?+ When and if this option becomes
available, incentives will exist to choose carbon removal
when this is less expensive than reducing fossil fuel combus-
tion through improvements in energy generation or use effi-
ciency. This would open up the possibility of applying the
deposit refund concept to CO, emission reduction. It could,
for example, provide a mechanism for the inclusion of sinks,
such as the development of new forests and other changes in
land management, in a market-based permit or tax system.

s already mentioned carbon can be removed from the atmos-
phere by enhancing natural sinks. It could also be removed by
technical means if cost-effective technologies can be devel-
oped. One policy instrument that might be considered to pro-
vide an incentive to undertake such carbon removal is a
deposit refund scheme. A deposit refund system can take one
of several forms. One variant combines a tax (deposit) on a
commodity with a subsidy for the socially least-cost disposal
option (a refund). Another uses mandated deposits, which re-
quire private sellers of a commodity to add to the price a
deposit that will be refunded under certain conditions. Yet
another uses a performance bond, which requires an agent en-
gaging in specified production activities to avoid certain
Negative consequences of these activities. For surveys of

Allowing permits to be banked. that is, allowing permits
for emissions during a given period (e.g., a year) to be used at
a later date, is important for both the efficiency and political
acceptability of a tradable permit scheme. Without a banking

"Stavins (1995a) considers a market for emission permits in
which costs are associated with the exchange of permits, and
he models several alternative types of transaction cost func-

increase abatement costs and, most important, that in some
cases, equilibrium permit allocations and hence aggregate
control costs are sensitive to initial permit distributions. Thus,
in the presence of transaction costs, the initial distribution of
permits can matter in terms of efficiency, as well as in terms of

equity.

The two approaches differ primarily in two respects. First,

grandfathering implies a “transfer” of wealth, equal to the
value of the permits, to existing firms, whereas, when permits
are auctioned by government, this wealth is transferred to the
government. The government would then collect revenue sim-
ilar to that from a domestic tax producing the same volume of
emissions. As with tax receipts, auction revenues could be
used to reduce preexisting distorting taxes as outlined in Sec-
tion 11.3. Second, since grandfathering improves the wealth
of incumbent firms and, given uncertainty, may keep them in
business longer than otherwise, this allocation approach may
reduce the rate of entry of new firms and slow technological
change (Bohm, 1994b).

By contrast with international tradable quota systems,
which have so far been applied on a small scale only (for ex-
ample, under the Montreal Protocol for the international CFC
production quota trade and for the CFC consumption quota
trade within the European Union), there is considerable expe-
rience with the use of tradable permit schemes within coun-
tries (see OECD, 1992b; UNCTAD, 1992). In most of these
applications, permits have been allocated by grandfathering.
Many of these applications have been designed to deal with
local air pollution problems, and, as a consequence, the permit
markets have often been relatively small and far from perfect.
This contrasts with the case of a tradable carbon permit sys-
tem, which would be nationwide. The contrast would be even
starker for an international scheme involving many govern-
ments and possibly large firms as well.

An international tradable quota scheme could coexist with
domestic permit schemes within each country, or particular
countries might choose to meet their emission targets by some
other means, such as taxes or regulatory systems. In the case
of a domestic tradable permit scheme, a national government
would issue emission permits (perhaps time-limited) to whole-
sale dealers in fossil fuels or producers and importers of fossil
fuels and allow them to trade on a domestic permit market.
The government could also allow permit holders to trade di-
rectly on an existing international market. Alternatively, to the
extent that both international quota and domestic permit mar-
kets existed for a particular country, the government could
trade on the international market and set a definite or prelimi-

In each period, countries would be free to buy and sell quo-

Time-limiting the quotas would probably be necessary not
only to account for uncertainty about the extent of the en-

situation where a government sold quotas, that is, part of the
nation’s wealth, to an extent that would not be honoured by

also reduce the risk of large countries gaining market power

the total international tax revenues would go to each partici-

Compared to an international tax agreement, where the ef-
fect on emissions is uncertain but related lump sum transfer
payments are known. the tradable quota system has a known
effect on emissions but quota prices are uncertain and, hence,
the distributional effects through quota trade are also uncer-
tain. (This ts true for fully global agreements; if only a limited
set of countries is involved, carbon leakage must be taken into
account in both cases.) This means that the benefits of known
effects on emissions in a tradable quota system must be
bought at the price of some distributional uncertainty. Thus, if
a decision is taken that a poor country should be offered some
minimum compensation, then initial quota allocations to that
country would have to be increased as compared with the case
under certainty. Alternatively, the agreement would have to
include some co-insurance system.

1994a, b; Reddy, 1993; Bohm, 1994a; Loske and Oberthiir.
1994; Jepma. 1995). In essence, there are three potential roles
for joint implementation: (a) as the first step toward establish-
ing an international tradable quota system for greenhouse
management among parties that have made a firm commit-
ment to limit their emissions: (b) as a cost-effective option for
developed countries to fund emission reduction projects in de-
veloping countries that have made no such commitments; and
(c) as an activity for exploring when it is cost-effective to
bring new emission sources or sinks into an existing interna-
tional greenhouse management scheme.

A system of joint implementation trades in carbon reduc-
tion projects could develop automatically into an international
tradable carbon quota system for countries that have carbon
targets (Bohm. 1994a). Where aggregate targets exist, the
joint level of aggregate carbon emissions reported is a suffi-
cient monitoring statistic for the actual aggregate abatement
levels undertaken by each country under a joint carbon reduc-
tion policy. Cost incentives are such that emission reductions
below the target in one country, when less costly than in an-
other country, would be purchased by. and credited to, the lat-
ter. In particular. when several countries are committed to
carbon target trading in this fashion, the incremental costs
of emission reductions will tend to be equalized across
economies. As a result, an international tradable quota scheme
could be established once countries commit to binding targets,
which would in effect then become their tradable quotas.

Another potential role for joint implementation is as a
complementary exploratory tool for gathering information to
expand an existing international regime that initially involves
only international carbon trading resulting from fossil fuel
emissions. Participating nations could agree to revisit the cov-
erage issue at fixed intervals, modifying strategies to accord
with the underlying science and economics of climate change.
Successful joint implementation programmes are those that
provide the necessary information to incorporate a truly cost-
effective new emission source or sink into an international
market-based policy. However, this application of joint imple-
mentation ri problems of estimating project emission
baselines similar to those mentioned in the preceding case,
and hence difficulties in ascertaining the nationwide net emis-
sion reduction effects of individual noncarbon projects, Cur-
rent and future joint implementation demonstration projects
could provide additional insight into these estimation prob-
lems, provided there were sufficient incentives for developed
countries to finance them.

"tries. Bohm (1994a) also considers the case of joint imple-
mentation between developed and developing countries, where
the former commit to binding targets but the latter do not. In
the absence of binding targets in developing countries it
would be difficult to determine the net emission reduction ef-
fects duc to a specific joint implementation project. since na-
tionwide indirect and direct effects on emissions must be
counted (see Tictenberg and Victor. 1994). The net emission
reduction effects of low-cost abatement projects are particu-
larly uncertain, since such projects may be close to being
profitable and, hence, may be carried out by the market itself
in the near future. In addition to these systematic risks, there
are incentives to misrepresent the effectiveness of projects.
Parties to a joint implementation project may exaggerate the
project’s nationwide net emission reduction effects. A clear-
inghouse version of joint implementation trades between de-
veloped and developing countries would eliminate these
incentives on the part of the buyer countries. The role of the
clearinghouse would be to screen and aggregate all projects
from potential sellers before they are offered as anonymous
carbon credits to buyers at a market clearing price.

Jorgenson ef al. (1992) provide the most detailed assess-

negative efficiency effect dominates when the carbon tax rev-
enue is rebated as a lump sum, and the much smaller equity
effect is either mildly progressive or regressive, depending on
assumptions regarding the nation’s aversion to income in-

In principle. if a policy is introduced in order to achieve a
particular outcome and it is found to be regressive, then the
theoretically appropriate policy instrument to deal with the
equity issue is a lump sum transfer to the affected parties. This
rests on the assumption that there are no nongreenhouse mar-
ket distortions. If such distortions exist, then nonlump-sum
transfers can improve welfare (Jorgenson er al., 1992). As
Schillo ef af. (1992) explain, if carbon tax revenue is used to
reduce labour taxes. or a blend of labour and capital taxes,
then simulated household welfare improves as the adverse ef-

There is evidence that the same holds true for the rest of
the world, although for quite a different reason. In developing
countries, institutional factors play an important role (see
Shah and Larsen, [992). In the developing world, progressiv-
ity, or at least low regressivity, could be fostered by three
mechanisms. First, a significant tax burden could be passed
on to foreign treasuries, producers, and consumers where
there is a significant degree of foreign direct investment from
countries where investors are allowed foreign tax credits
against domestic liabilities. Second, price controls could be
applied to limit the ability of producers to pass the tax on to
consumers in terms of higher prices. Finally, combined with
binding import quotas or rationed foreign exchange, a tax

In the case of a scheme to reduce global emissions, there
typically will be many more participants than under the
schemes operating in the U.S. This would reduce the problem
of market power. In an international scheme, firms that are
large domestic emitters may be required to hold permits as a
means of broadening the market. If market power poses a

power in the output market for the product that “generates”
emissions. Market power in the permit market is sufficient but
not necessary for market power in the output market (BIE,

In the following sections a review is undertaken of what
is known about some prominent issues regarding the imple-

Where appropriate, reference is also made to regulatory sys-
tems, IC is important to note that most of the research on trad-
able permit schemes is based on experience in the U.S.. where
such schemes were superimposed on regulatory policies.
These schemes typically involve a limited number of partic-
ipants and eternal permits allocated by grandfathering, To
control carbon emissions, however, tradable permit schemes
might operate where there was no former regulation. They
would also involve a larger number of participants, and per-
mits might be time-limited and allocated by auction. Thus, ex-
perience in the U.S. may not generalize to such schemes with
rather different characteristics.

An emission tax designed to make emitters face the full
costs of production will tend to result in a cost-effective allo-
cation of the control burden, provided that emitters are all
price takers (that is, small relative to the size of the market).
But this outcome does not necessarily occur where emitters
have some degree of monopoly power in emission-intensive
output markets (Buchanan, 1969). In principle, a monopolist
in an output market for an emission-intensive commodity will
tend to reduce output below the competitive level in order to
raise its profits. Hence, the welfare gains from reduced emis-
sions must more than offset the losses from the monopolist’s
reduced output for an emission tax to be worthwhile (Cropper
and Oates, 1992). Which effect dominates is an empirical is-
sue.*5 For example. Oates and Strassman (1984) find that mo-
nopoly power in the output market is unlikely to be a key
concern in their study of U.S. industries.

The degree of competition in the tradable permit market
will affect the extent to which potential control cost savings
are likely to be realized. Hahn (1984) considers the case of a
monopsonist (a price-setting buyer) who forces down the real
permit price below the competitive level. This behaviour is
not cost-effective, since the monopsonist buys too few per-
mits (spends too much on abatement) whereas the competitive
agents will buy too many (thus spending too little on abate-
ment). Misiolek and Elder (1989) consider the converse case
of a monopolist (a price-setting seller) who forces up the real
permit price above the competitive level. That is, the monopo-
list spends too little on abatement whereas competitive agents
spend too much. To the extent that market power derives from
the initial allocation of permits, one solution may be to limit
the number of permits held by any player (Tietenberg, 1985).
This may be achieved by widening the market to many play-
ers, using a variety of means, including limiting the temporal
duration of permits.

Economists have tended to give greater emphasis to the

symmetry between tradable permits and pollution charges
than to their differences, although the two approaches are not
symmetrical under conditions of uncertainty (Weitzman,
1974), in the presence of transaction costs (Stavins, 1995a), or
under a number of other conditions (Stavins and Whitehead,
1992). Analyses that have compared taxes and permits have
assumed zero transaction costs. Systems of pollution taxes
can also involve substantial administrative costs, both fixed
(per firm) and variable (Polinsky and Shavell, 1982).

a result of which more information is generated and uncer-

was required to ensure that the associated environmental ob-
jectives were met. Furthermore, it has partly been concerns
about future regulatory uncertainty that have discouraged in-

that trading involves large transaction costs but that trading
regimes should be designed partly with the aim of keeping
transaction costs low.

"The magnitude of these transaction costs will depend on the
structure of the market and the extent to which individual
transactions require regulatory approval. If a full market is de-
veloped, a market price for permits will be known, and this
price will convey all the information parties need in order to
decide whether to trade. One party would not need to search
for another to trade with, and the terms of trade would not
need to be negotiated. Even where such a full market does not
develop, innovations may serve to keep transaction costs low.
For example, where there are search and information costs,
brokers may provide information about pollution control op-
tions and potential trading partners in order to exploit poten-
tial gains from trade. The third source of transaction costs —
monitoring and enforcement — can be significant, but these
costs are typically borne by the responsible government au-
thority and not by trading partners and, hence, do not fall
within the notion of transaction costs incurred by firms as de-

fined here.

"There is abundant anecdotal evidence indicating the preva-
lence of significant transaction costs in some U.S. trading pro-
grammes involving mainly local pollution. Atkinson and
Tietenberg (1991) survey six empirical studies that found
trading levels — and hence cost savings — in permit markets
to be lower than anticipated by theoretical models. Liroff
(1989) suggests that this experience with permit systems
“demonstrates the need for. . . recognition of the adminis-
trative and related transaction costs associated with transfer
systems.”3° For example, under the U.S. Environmental Pro-
tection Agency’s emission trading programme for “criteria air
pollutants,” there is no ready means for buyers and sellers to
identify one another, and as a result buyers frequently pay
substantial fees to consultants who assist in the search for
available permits (Hahn, 1989). At the other extreme, the high
level of trading that took place under the programme of lead
rights trading among refineries as part of the U.S. EPA’s
leaded gasoline phasedown has been attributed to the pro-
gramme’s minimal administrative requirements and the fact
that the potential trading partners (refineries) were already ex-
perienced at striking deals with one another (Hahn and Hester,
1989a). Hence. transaction costs were kept to a minimum and
there was little need for intermediaries.

~ Barrett (1994a) surveys several global simulation studies
that provide positive leakage estimates, including GREEN,
!2RT, Global 2100, and the Whalley-Wigle model. The leak-
age rate is defined as the increase in emissions by noncooper-
ating countries divided by the reduction in emissions by
cooperating countries. The evidence of positive emission
leakage varies widely and is strongly dependent on the model
used. For example, positive leakage rates are low in GREEN

"For example, Barrett (1994a) explains how the threat of a

to support full participation in a greenhouse management
scheme. The key to this agreement, as with the Montreal Pro-
tocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, is that the
threatened trade ban would come into effect once a threshold
level of countries agreed to participate in the scheme. How-
ever, the threshold is determined so that all countries would
gain from participation once it is reached. [In other words, it is
not necessary that trade be restricted, but rather that the threat
to impose trade restrictions be credible.

As Hoel (1992), Carraro and Siniscalco (1993), and Barrett
(1994b) have shown, a stable coalition of cooperating coun-
tries may exist in spite of free-rider incentives. The size of this
coalition will depend on the ability of the cooperating coun-
tries to punish countries that might withdraw from the coali-
tion and to reward countries that might accede to it. However,
to be effective, such punishments and rewards must be both
substantial and credible, and these requirements often clash.
As a result, the size of the stable coalition may be quite small.
In fact, these analyses do not consider international trade, and
where there is trade, free riding will be exacerbated by leak-
age. On the other hand, trade may also provide a vehicle for
deterring free riding.

There are two main channels through which emission leakage
may be transmitted, First, the implementation of a carbon
abatement policy by a coalition of cooperating countries
would shift comparative advantage in carbon-intensive goods
towards noncooperating countries. As a result, production of
such goods, and emissions, would rise outside the coalition.
Second, the unilateral policy would have the effect of lower-
ing world demand for carbon-intensive fuels, and thereby re-
duce the world price for such fuels traded in international
markets. As a result (and ignoring income effects), demand
for such fuels, and emissions, are likely to rise outside the
coalition. It should be emphasized that these two responses by
noncooperating countries do not result from any deliberate
policy to increase emissions, but rather result from the ab-
sence of a policy to reduce: emissions.

In particular, Pezzey estimates that a 20% reduction in car-
bon emissions within the European Union alone (relative to a
baseline trend) would be associated with a leakage rate of
80%. In other words, for every 10 tonnes of carbon abated by
the EU, global emissions would fall by only 2 tonnes. Pezzey
also calculates that a 20% reduction in OECD emissions
would be associated with a leakage rate of 70%. These leak-
age rates suggest that unilateral policy would be largely inef-
fective. On the other hand, Oliveira-Martins et al. (1992)
estimate much lower leakage rates for policies aimed at stabi-
lizing carbon emissions at their 1990 levels. They estimate
leakage rates for a unilateral EU policy of 11.9% in 1995 and
2.2% in 2050, and for a unilateral OECD policy of 3.5% in
1995 and 1.4% in 2050. These leakage rates suggest that leak-
age does not render unilateral policy ineffective. These rates are
more in accord with those reported by Hanslow ef al. (1995),
who estimate that a policy-induced 20% reduction in CO, in
Annex I countries would be associated with a leakage rate of

As already noted, other studies estimate leakage rates
somewhere between these two sets of estimates. Oliveira-

regions in some years, and Horton ef al., (1992) argue that
leakage may exceed 100% in some cases. Currently, there is
no consensus among economists about the magnitude of leak-

helpful if leakage rates were calculated for identical simula-

The above studies ignore a possible third channel for leak-

age transmission. Under certain assumptions, noncooperating
countries will abate their emissions up to the point where their
own national marginal benefit of abatement equals their own
marginal cost of abatement (see Barrett, 1994b). In the ex-
treme, this optimization rule will mean that noncooperating
countries will not abate their emissions at all. However, more
generally, this rule implies that noncooperating countries will
abate their emissions by less than they would if they cooper-
ated. Where noncooperating countries do undertake positive
unilateral abatement, and where the marginal benefit of abate-
ment to noncooperating countries decreases with the level of
global abatement, an increase in abatement by cooperating
countries will create an incentive for noncooperating coun-
tries to reduce their abatement. Hence, leakage may occur

Although border tax adjustments may theoretically be ap-
propriate for reducing leakage, their application poses a num-
ber of practical problems. How are the emissions associated
with the manufacture of a particular product to be deter-
mined? The Montreal Protocol includes a provision for re-
stricting trade in products made using ozone-depleting
substances, such as electronics components that are made us-
ing CFCs as a solvent. However, this provision has not been
implemented, and the Protocol Secretariat was advised in
1993 that to do so would not be feasible (Van Slooten, 1994).
To implement the provision would require either sophisticated
equipment capable of detecting trace residues of CFCs or cer-
tification of the manufacturing facilities of industries in coun-
tries that are not parties to the agreement. In the case of global
climate change, similar adjustments would be even harder to
implement, as virtually all production results in some green-
house gas emissions.

What happens in this standard framework when coalition
membership is less than global? This issue has been examined
by Markusen (1975), Krutilla (1991), Bohm (1993), Hoel
(1994, 1995), and Barrett (1994a). Treating the coalition as a
single entity and the rest of the world as another single entity
suggests that, if the coalition is a net importer of carbon-
intensive products in the absence of the carbon tax, then a
tariff should be imposed on its imports to reduce emission
leakage through the terms of trade. If the coalition is a net ex-
porter of these products in the absence of a carbon tax, then it
should subsidize its exports. This response minimizes the
coalition cost of meeting the greenhouse constraint. Precisely
the same argument holds for leakage through trade in carbon-
based fossil fuels. In addition, instead of using an import tariff
(export subsidy) the equivalent production subsidy (tax) and
consumption tax (subsidy) could be applied in the coalition.
Hoel (1995) shows that if an optimal tariff (subsidy) or its
equivalent can be employed, then the carbon tax should be
uniform across all sectors in all coalition countries, but, if not,
then differential tax rates and exemptions may be required.

In the first example. the use of quotas to reduce risks will
be considered for investments that have the potential to re-
duce emissions. Such investments include research and devel-
opment into new abatement technologies and the transfer of
abatement technology across countries. These investments
may either succeed or fail and. hence, the return to the invest-
ment is uncertain. The key to the risk-reducing role of quotas
is that the quota price will be negatively correlated with the
success of the investment.

An important merit of an international tradable quota sys-

used as a risk management tool to reduce the costs of green-
house risks, Some simple examples of the risk management
potential of a quota scheme are given below. In these exam-
ples, quotas themselves are used us the hedging instrument, If
a sophisticated market were to develop, “derivatives” of quo-
tas. such as options and forward and futures contracts, might
be used to perform these risk management functions more ef-
ficiently. However, in the first instance, the logic of the risk
management potential of quotas can be brought out most sim-
ply by taking quotas as the instrument.

Private provision of brokerage services can also play an

A major factor favouring a tradable quota scheme, there-
fore, is that a forward and/or futures market based on (net)
emission quota contracts would provide a way of efficiently
reducing the elements of uncertainty and risk in greenhouse
costs. This would reduce the costs of control and stimulate in-
vestment in the research, development, and use of least-cost
mechanisms for net emission control. For example, suppose a
country invests in a risky technology transfer project as part
of a strategy to mect its national greenhouse target. It can hedge
against the risk of project failure by buying futures. Any profit
on the futures market transaction can partly compensate for
any rise in the spot price if it needs to buy quotas.

As mentioned above, a forward or futures market could
provide a more effective risk management tool than the direct
use of a quota market in the simple examples described. A for-
ward market for quotas could develop if there were a sufficient
number of hedgers and speculators, and none of them had ex-
cessive influence over price signals. The latter requirement
could be met by a rule fixing the maximum share of total net
emission entitlements held by any one country. By reducing
the costs of risk and uncertainty, time-limited quotas would
tend to reduce any nation’s incentive to pursue strategic be-
haviour (such as quota hoarding) and could also reduce valid-

In the second example, the use of quotas (or permits) to
manage the temporal nature of risk is emphasized. Invest-
ments in some activities such as coal-fired power stations
have a long payback period and generate emissions. If emis-
sions are taxed, future tax levels may have a critical bearing
on the return on the investment. There may be sufficient un-
certainty about future tax levels to deter some risk-averse in-
vestors from the project. However, under a quota scheme, if
there are quotas of sufficient duration, the costs of future
emissions to investors can be known with certainty. However,
in a scheme dominated by long-lived quotas, there would be
inflexibility in adapting emissions to changing information on
desirable emission levels. A number of ways to reduce this
problem have been proposed. 38

Investors can use this negative correlation between the
price of quotas and the success of the project to reduce the
variability of their returns. If quotas are bought at the start of
the project and it fails, investors will be able to sell their quo-
tas above the purchase price. Such a profit will help to offset
their losses on the project. If the project succeeds, investors
will suffer a loss on their quota sales. However, by narrowing
the gap in expected profits between a successful and unsuc-
cessful outcome, quota operations will reduce the risks for
investors (see Epstein and Gupta, 1990, for a numerical
example). Risk-averse investors will be willing to trade
higher average profits for more certain profits. The availabil-

In the U.S. an auction system for forward sales of emission
quotas is provided for in the 1990 amendment to the Clean Air
Act for controlling domestic sulphur dioxide (SO,) emissions
from fossil fuel fired power plants. As Howe (1994) notes, the
amended legislation requires total SO, emissions from the U.S.
electricity power sector to be around 50% below the 1980 level
by the year 2000. After January |, 1995, each of the II]
power plants directly affected in the first phase of measures
must hold tradable quotas covering its total annual emissions
target (its quota allocation), capped at about 50% of the 1980
level. Currently, allowances may be traded to any party or
credited (“banked”) for future use. In the second phase, begin-
ning January 1, 2000, most electric power utilities will be
brought within the system. In addition to receiving an annual
target allowance, quotas for excess emissions may be bought
directly from other plants or through auctions held by the
Chicago Board of Trade for the United States Environmental

High rates of economic growth and price inflation could

that markets are relatively complete (Stavins and Zylicz,

Concentration of product or emission permit markets due

in industrial sector shares in the economy, and disruptions in
international trading relationships could also affect the stabil-

from alternative policy instruments. Effective taxes may, for
example, increase bankruptcies in a period of severe eco-

many enterprises may be unable to respond efficiently to pol-

On the other hand, it is necessary to consider the public as
well as the private costs of control (Stavins, 1995a). In other
words, the total costs to be minimized by a truly cost-effective
environmental policy instrument include both the costs of
abatement (typically borne by private industry and including
transaction costs) and the costs of administration (typically
borne by government in the form of monitoring and enforce-
ment costs). When monitoring and enforcement needs are
particularly burdensome, performance-based standards in gen-
eral may not be cost-effective. On the other hand, certain forms
of technology standards, which are typically relatively high-
cost in terms of abatement, can involve only minimal needs
for adequate monitoring and enforcement. Finally, in addition
to such concerns about static or allocative cost-effectiveness,
it is important to consider the relative effects of alternative
policy instruments on the invention, innovation, and diffusion
of new technologies. That is, in the long term, it is the dy-
namic efficiency properties of environmental policy instru-

And finally, there are several reasons why politicians have
traditionally taken a regulatory approach, rather than an eco-
nomic incentive-based approach to environmental policy
(Bohm and Russell, 1985; Hahn and Stavins. 1991). First, in-
dustry tends to favour direct regulation over incentive mecha-
nisms because (a) if a tax instrument is used, the polluter must
pay fees in addition to controlling costs, although the accep-
tance of this approach will be influenced by any revenue recy-
cling, as mentioned above; and (b) firms may have greater
influence over the specifics of uniform standards. Second, the
effects of quantity regulation are likely to be perceived to be
more certain than pollution charges, whose effect will depend
on abatement cost functions, which are typically unknown.
Third, economic efficiency arguments often rely on a rela-
tively sophisticated understanding of market operation and
price effects which seem indirect when compared with regula-
tion of the polluting activity. Finally, in many countries, econ-
omists play a minor role in the development of environmental
policy, compared with the number of decision makers with
backgrounds in law, natural science, or engineering.

to issue permits with different durations (Bertram, 1992) or
for a set of future (for example, five-year) periods. Firms un-
dertaking emission-intensive investments with long payback
periods would be able to reduce uncertainty about future costs
by buying permits for the desired number of periods. The de-
velopment of a forward or futures market for permits (that
could be coupled with permits of different duration) would
provide an even better mechanism to spread the risks associ-
ated with uncertainty about future emission policy. Firms un-
dertaking research and development into technologies to
reduce emissions would be able to hedge the risks associated
with the payoff from such technologies through operations in
the futures market (Epstein and Gupta, 1990). Similarly, firms
investing in emission-intensive activities would be able to
hedge against the risks of future policy changes through the
operations of futures markets.

A system of international taxes, where all participating
countries were liable to pay a given carbon tax, could include
an agreement on how tax receipts would be shared among the
participants. Under such a system countries might retain all or
part of the taxes raised domestically, and some participants
(low-income countries) might receive a transfer (Hoel, 1993).
Each country would have a good knowledge of the amount of
tax revenue likely to be raised internally. However, less infor-
mation would be available about other countries’ tax revenues
and, hence, there would be uncertainty about the size of the
net transfers to and from each country.

definition they use less fue] in the air/fuel mix. A 10% improvement
in fuel efficiency has been reported for Toyota’s lean-burn control
system with two-way converter (Watson 1994), Such an improve-
ment in fuel efficiency would have to be offset against other effects
of lean-burn technology. such as lower temperatures of operation and
less smooth running in the absence of more sophisticated engine-
control systems. Any disincentive to the technological development
of lean-burn engines is of particular concern in the context of reduc-

vehicle-based “engineering” advances in this respect depend essen-
tially on improving fuel efficiencies.

"Thus, the choice between a tax and a quota regime remains
ambiguous. As Yohe (1992) points out, nations facing differ-
ent circumstances could favour different control strategies.
For example, if a case can be made that the marginal social
cost of climate change is relatively flat in industrial countries
because of their comparative advantage in applying technol-
ogy to adapting to change, then such countries might favour a
tax instrument. On the other hand, developing countries that
are likely to face much steeper marginal social cost schedules
because of their lower capacity to adapt may favour a system
of tradable quotas (perhaps regardless of the initial quota allo-
cation).

A tradable quota scheme leaves each participant to decide
what domestic policy to use. Such a scheme does not require
any ongoing side payments. Here, the initial allocation of
quota entitlements among countries reflects distributional
considerations. A disadvantage of a tradable quota scheme is
that the (endogenous) future prices in international quota
trade are unknown when an agreement on the quota allocation
is reached. Hence, the exact distributional implications cannot
be known beforehand. This is the price paid for the main ad-
vantage of such a scheme, namely that the resulting global
emissions will be known with certainty for a global agreement

and, net of carbon leakage, for a nonglobal agreement.

"A system of harmonized domestic carbon taxes would in-
volve an agreement about compensatory international fi-
nancial transfers as well as the precarbon tax net tax rates
on fossil fuels. These taxes would represent (at least) what
amounts to an estimate of the domestic environmental effects
of fossil fuel combustion. Internationally acceptable estimates
of these basic tax levels, which would tend to differ between
countries, would be difficult to establish. Moreover, no design
seems feasible and generally acceptable where participants
are not allowed to undertake policies on their own which indi-
rectly affect fossil fuel use, such as levying a tax on substi-
tutes for carbon and subsidizing complements to carbon
(Hoel, 1993). Thus, there are significant risks that a tax har-
monization agreement would either never be adopted or fail
after implementation.

"32. For a general discussion, see Bohm (1992). “Appropriate” initial
allocations can serve as an effective device to draw countries — par-
ticularly, developing countries — into an international agreement. On
this, see Barrett (1992c) and Hinchy ef a/. (19942, b). Most proposals
for allocating control obligations among nations call for proportion-
ately higher rates of reduction in emissions by the industrialized
countries (and, among the industrialized countries, by the U.S.) and
substantial reductions in the predicted rates of increase in CO, emis-
sions by most developing countries. See, for example, Krause

"fects. However, this is not the case where economies are growing and
production technology differs across countries (in the sense that dif-
ferent quantities of capital and emissions are required to produce a
given output of consumption or capital goods). In this case, transfers
make it possible to raise the growth rate of an economy above the
maximum determined by its original productive capacity. This is il-
lustrated by Hinchy and Hanslow (1994), using an n-country general-
ization of a model developed by Tahvonen and Kuuluvainen (1993).
28. When permits are leased from government or when time-limited
permits are auctioned by government, the revenue implications of
permit schemes approach those of taxes. Theoretical analysis indi-
cates that this is not true in the case where eternal permits are auc-

Mar-
ginal costs vary with the demand for electricity and, during peak
periods, exceed the average cost. Demand-side management pro-
grammes that shift demand from peak periods to lower-cost periods
reduce costs with little loss of revenue. Such programmes can reduce
current demand and still pass the RIM test. Load growth creates a
need to add capacity. This affects future rates regardless of whether
the marginal costs of the new capacity are higher or lower than those
of existing capacity. Demand-side management programmes that
lower load growth defer the need to add capacity and so reduce costs.
Since the demand-side management costs are incurred earlier than
the expenditures for new capacity, they lead to an initial increase in
rates. However, assuming all the estimates to be accurate, the rates
should ultimately decrease.

35. Although there is no cutoff point, it is unlikely that firms or na-
tions could engage in price-setting behaviour if they controlled less
than 10% of the market (see Scherer, 1980). Ultimately, the ques-
tion is whether other firms present credible threats of entry to the mar-
ket — that is, whether the market is “contestable.” If so, it is less likely
that anticompetitive behaviour can thrive (see Baumol et al., 1982).
36. Alternative explanations of low observed trading levels have also
been advanced. These include lumpy investment in pollution-control
technology: concentration in permit or product markets; the sequen-
tial and bilateral nature of the trading process (in the context of a
nonuniformly mixed pollutant) leading to some initial trades that
then preclude better trades from being carried out subsequently
(Atkinson and Tietenberg, 1991): and the regulatory environment.
Some of these “alternative explanations” of low trading levels can be
viewed as special cases of transaction costs, broadly defined.

37. This problem may exist within groups of countries as well as
more generally. For a discussion of issues surrounding the attempted
introduction of a harmonized carbon tax in the European Union and a
