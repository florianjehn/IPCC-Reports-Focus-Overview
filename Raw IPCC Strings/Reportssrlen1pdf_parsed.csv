jointly established by the World Meteorological Organization
(WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme
(UNEP) in 1988 to: (i) assess available information on the sci-

mitigating and/or adapting to, climate change; and (ii) provide,
on request, scientific/technical/socioeconomic advice to the
Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations

"This Special Report examines several key questions relating to
the exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and the terres-
trial pool of aboveground biomass, below-ground biomass, and
soils. Vegetation exchanges carbon dioxide between the atmos-
phere and the terrestrial biosphere through photosynthesis and
plant and soil respiration. This natural exchange has been occur-
ring for hundreds of millions of years. Humans are changing the
natural rate of exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and
the terrestrial biosphere through land use, land-use change, and
forestry activities. Consequently, it is important to examine how
carbon flows between different pools and how carbon stocks
change in response to afforestation, reforestation, and defor-
estation (ARD) and other land-use activities.
"	Text
"Implementation of the Kyoto Protocol requires mutually
acceptable definitions for a wide range of terms to ensure that
effective sequestration strategies are planned and implemented.
For instance, if key terms such as forests, afforestation, refor-
estation, and deforestation are not clearly defined or if carbon
accounting principles are not clearly established, it becomes
difficult to comprehend the implications of different land-use
activities. Hence, the challenge is to derive a set of definitions
that are simple and consistent with the aims of the UNFCCC
and the Kyoto Protocol. To achieve this goal, definitions should
be applicable to all Parties and be addressed using data that can
be readily accessed. This process will enable Parties to esti-
mate carbon stock changes that would need to be included in
the calculation of assigned amounts.
"	Text
"In examining issues relating to land use, land-use change, and
forestry, several critical scientific and technical questions pre-
sent themselves. What are the implications of using different
definitions or sets of definitions? Do the definitions need to be
flexible enough to accommodate our present understanding of
carbon dynamics while allowing for future innovations and
advances? How do we distinguish among direct human-
induced activities, indirect human-induced activities, and nat-
ural environmental variability that affects carbon uptake and
release? How do we differentiate between pre- and post-1990
direct human activities? How do we measure changes in carbon
stocks and flows in a transparent and verifiable manner over
time? How permanent are carbon stocks? To what extent do we
trade simplicity for accuracy in accounting?

"The dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems depend on interac-
tions between a number of biogeochemical cycles, particu-
larly the carbon cycle, nutrient cycles, and the hydrological
cycle, all of which may be modified by human actions.
Terrestrial ecological systems, in which carbon is retained in
live biomass, decomposing organic matter, and soil, play an
important role in the global carbon cycle. Carbon is
exchanged naturally between these systems and the atmos-
phere through photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition,
and combustion. Human activities change carbon stocks in
these pools and exchanges between them and the atmosphere
through land use, land-use change, and forestry, among
other activities. Substantial amounts of carbon have been
released from forest clearing at high and middle latitudes
over the last several centuries, and in the tropics during the
latter part of the 20th century. [1.1.1.2]!

There is carbon uptake into both vegetation and soils in ter-
restrial ecosystems. Current carbon stocks are much larger

and accounting rules. It identifies a range of options and
discusses implications and interrelationships among
options;

"Under Article 3.1 of the Kyoto Protocol, the Annex I Parties
have agreed to limit and reduce their emissions of green-
house gases between 2008 and 2012.

The Kyoto Protocol makes provision for Annex I Parties to
take into account afforestation, reforestation, and defor-
estation (ARD) and other agreed land use, land-use change,
and forestry (LULUCF) activities in meeting their commit-
ments under Article 3.

To implement the Kyoto Protocol, issues related to LULUCF
will have to be considered. Relevant issues may include for
example:

° Definitions, including land-use change, forests, forestry
activities, including afforestation, reforestation, and
deforestation, carbon stocks, human-induced, and direct
human-induced;

* Methodological issues, such as:
> Rules for accounting for carbon stock changes and

for emissions and removals of greenhouse gases

from LULUCF activities, including:

— Which carbon pools to include;

— How to implement “since 1990,” “direct
human-induced,” and “human-induced”;

— How to address the risks and effects of events
such as fires, pest outbreaks, and extreme
meteorological events; baselines; permanence;
interannual and decadal climate variability;
and leakage;

— Accuracy, precision, and uncertainties in
tracking carbon stocks and greenhouse
gases;

> Approaches, such as geo-referencing and statisti-
cal sampling, associated with identifying lands
with activities defined under Article 3.3, accepted
under Article 3.4, or associated with project-based
activities under the Kyoto Protocol, and measuring
and estimating changes in carbon stocks and green-
house gases;

> Verification procedures;

e Determination of how and which additional activities
pursuant to Article 3.4 are included;

* How to link the first and subsequent commitment
periods;

e Determination of how and which project-based activi-
ties are included;

1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories and the Good Practice Guidance and
Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories;

could be associated with Articles 3.3 and 3.4 and pro-
ject-based activities.

a few decades are uncertain. [1.3.2.2]

Emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N20)
are influenced by land use, land-use change, and forestry
activities (e.g., restoration of wetlands, biomass burning, and
fertilization of forests). Hence, to assess the greenhouse gas
implications of LULUCF activities, changes in CHy and N,0
emissions and removals — the magnitude of which is highly
uncertain — would have to be considered explicitly. There are
currently no reliable global estimates of these emissions and
removals for LULUCF activities. [1.2.2, 1.2.3, 3.3.2]
"	List
"Ecosystem models indicate that the additional terrestrial
uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide arising from the indi-
rect effects of human activities (e.g., CO2 fertilization and
nutrient deposition) on a global scale is likely to be main-
tained for a number of decades in forest ecosystems, but may
gradually diminish and forest ecosystems could even become
a source. One reason for this is that the capacity of ecosys-
tems for additional carbon uptake may be limited by nutri-
ents and other biophysical factors. A second reason is that the
rate of photosynthesis in some types of plants may no longer
increase as carbon dioxide concentration continues to rise,
whereas heterotrophic respiration is expected to rise with
increasing temperatures. A third reason is that ecosystem
degradation may result from climate change. These conclu-
sions consider the effect of future CO and climate change
on the present sink only and do not take into account future
deforestation or actions to enhance the terrestrial sinks for
which no comparable analyses have been made. Because of
current uncertainties in our understanding with respect to
acclimation of the physiological processes and climatic con-
straints and feedbacks amongst the processes, projections
beyond a few decades are highly uncertain. [1.3.3]

"ecosystems in middle and high latitudes (see
Table 1). [1.3.1]

From 1850 to 1998, approximately 270 (+ 30) Gt C has
been emitted as carbon dioxide (CO?) into the atmosphere
from fossil fuel burning and cement production. About 136
(+ 55) Gt C has been emitted as a result of land-use change,
predominantly from forest ecosystems. This has led to an
increase in the atmospheric content of carbon dioxide of
176 (+ 10) Gt C. Atmospheric concentrations increased
from about 285 to 366 ppm (i.e., by ~28%), and about 43%
of the total emissions over this time have been retained in
the atmosphere. The remainder, about 230 (+ 60) Gt C, is
estimated to have been taken up in approximately equal
amounts in the oceans and the terrestrial ecosystems. Thus,
on balance, the terrestrial ecosystems appear to have been
a comparatively small net source of carbon dioxide during
this period. [1.2.1]

The average annual global carbon budgets for 1980-1989 and
1989-1998 are shown in Table 2. This table shows that the
rates and trends of carbon uptake in terrestrial ecosystems are
quite uncertain. However, during these two decades, terres-
trial ecosystems may have served as a small net sink for
carbon dioxide. This terrestrial sink seems to have occurred
in spite of net emissions into the atmosphere from land-use
change, primarily in the tropics, having been 1.7 +
0.8 Gt C yr-! and 1.6 + 0.8 Gt C yr! during these two
decades, respectively. The net terrestrial carbon uptake, that
approximately balances the emissions from land-use change
in the tropics, results from land-use practices and natural
regrowth in middle and high latitudes, the indirect effects of
human activities (e.g., atmospheric COp fertilization and
nutrient deposition), and changing climate (both natural and
anthropogenic). It is presently not possible to determine the
relative importance of these different processes, which also
vary from region to region. [1.2.1 and Figure 1-1]

time period, a full carbon accounting system would consist
of a complete accounting for changes in carbon stocks across
all carbon pools. Applying full carbon accounting to all
land in each country would, in principle, yield the net carbon
exchange between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmos-
phere. However, the Kyoto Protocol specifies, among other
things, that attention focus onto those land areas subject to
“direct human-induced” activities since 1990 (Article 3.3) or
human-induced activities (Article 3.4). [2.3.2.5]

"17. Most definitions of forest are based in part on a single
threshold of minimum canopy cover. However, such defin-
itions may allow changes in carbon stocks to remain unac-
counted under Article 3.3. For example, if a high threshold
for canopy cover (e.g., 70% canopy cover) is used in the def-
inition of a forest, then many areas of sparse forest and
woodland could be cleared or could increase in cover with-
out the losses or gains in carbon being counted under Article
3.3. If a low threshold is set (e.g., 10% canopy cover), then
dense forest could be heavily degraded and significant
amounts of carbon released, without the actions being des-
ignated as deforestation. Similarly, a forest, for example
with 15% canopy cover, could be considerably enhanced
without the actions qualifying as reforestation or afforesta-
tion under Article 3.3. Approaches to address partly these
problems may include, inter alia, using national, regional, or
biome-specific thresholds (e.g., a low canopy cover for
savannas and a high canopy cover for moist forests). [2.2.2,
3.2, 3.3.2]

There are many possible definitions of a “forest” and
approaches to the meaning of the terms “afforestation,”
“reforestation,” and “deforestation” (ARD). The choice of
definitions will determine how much and which land in
Annex I countries are included under the provisions of
Article 3.3, lands associated with activities included under
Article 3.3 (hereafter “lands under Article 3.3’). The amount
of land included will have implications for the changes in
carbon stocks accounted for under Article 3.3. [2.2.2, 2.2.3,
3.2, 3.5.2, 3.5.3]

Seven definitional scenarios were developed that combine
definitions of forest and ARD and reflect a range of
approaches that can be taken. The scenarios are not intend-
ed to be exhaustive. They can be split into two representative
groups, which are discussed in the SPM: (1) scenarios in
which only a forest/non-forest conversion (i.e., a land-use
change triggers accounting under Article 3.3) (e.g., IPCC
Definitional Scenario), and (2) scenarios in which land-
cover change or activities trigger accounting under Article
3.3 (e.g., FAO Definitional Scenario). [2.2.2, 2.2.3, 3.2,
3.5.2, 3.5.3, Table 3-4]

est on land that has been without forest for a period of time
(e.g., 20-50 years or more) and was previously under a
different land use. The precise period that distinguishes
afforested from reforested land is not important in account-
ing for lands covered under Article 3.3 provided afforestation
and reforestation are treated identically under the Protocol,
as they are in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National
Greenhouse Gas Inventories.” [2.2.3, 3.3.2]

"25. Article 3.3 encompasses ARD activities that have occurred
since 1990 but recognizes only verifiable carbon stock
changes in each commitment period. This has several impli-
cations. For example:

° For lands deforested between 1990 and the beginning
of the first commitment period only a fraction of
carbon stock changes (such as those from delayed
carbon emissions from soil and wood products if they
are accounted) will occur during the commitment
period and would be debited under Article 3.3. If these

"2. The Glossary of the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines describes
afforestation as “Planting of new forests on lands which, historically,
have not contained forests. These newly created forests are included in
the category Changes in Forest and Other Woody Biomass Stocks in
the Land Use Change and Forestry module of the emissions inventory
calculations” and reforestation as “Planting of forests on lands which
have, historically, previously contained forests but which have been
converted to some other use. Replanted forests are included in the cate-
gory Changes in Forest and Other Woody Biomass Stocks in the Land
Use Change and Forestry module of the emissions inventory calcula-
tions.” Deforestation does not appear in the Glossary of the Revised
1996 IPCC Guidelines. The Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines state,
referring to land-use change, that “Conversion of forests is also
referred to as ‘deforestation’ and it is frequently accompanied by
burning.” The Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines were developed before
the Kyoto Protocol was adopted and therefore provisions may not be
sufficient to meet the needs of the Kyoto Protocol.

"23. There are several consequences of using definitions that lead
to the creation of lands under Article 3.3 by the harvest-
regeneration cycle (i.e., where harvesting is included in the
definition of deforestation, or regeneration is included in the
definition of reforestation). For example, a forest estate man-
aged on a sustainable-yield basis where an area of forest is cut
in a regular cycle (e.g., 1/50th of the forest is harvested and
regenerated each year on a 50-year rotation cycle) may be in
approximate carbon balance. However, in this case, only those
stands harvested or regenerated since 1990 would be consid-
ered lands under Article 3.3. The regrowth (carbon sink) on
these lands will be less than the carbon emissions due to har-
vesting until all stands of the estate are lands under Article 3.3.
Different definitional and accounting approaches would have
different accounting consequences. For example:

"If emissions from harvesting during a commitment
period prior to regeneration are not counted (land-
based approach II; see Table 3), then during the first
and subsequent commitment periods a net credit
would generally arise from a managed forest estate
that is approximately in carbon balance. This may be
offset to some extent by delayed emissions from soils
and harvest residues;

If emissions from harvesting during a commitment peri-
od are not counted (activity-based approach; see
Table 3), then during the first and subsequent commit-
ment periods a net credit would arise from regeneration
in a managed forest estate that is approximately in
carbon balance. It would be practically very difficult to
separate changes in soil carbon pools associated with
harvesting and regeneration activities.

version of non-forested lands to forests with the only dif-
ference being the length of time during which the land was
without forest. [2.2.3, 3.2]

An alternative definition of deforestation might be based
on a decrease in the canopy cover or carbon density by a
given amount or crossing one of a sequence of thresholds.
Similarly, afforestation and reforestation could be defined in
terms of an increase in canopy cover or carbon density.
None of these definitions involves the concept of a land-use
change. [2.2.2, 3.2]

Definitions of a forest based strictly on actual canopy cover
without consideration of potential canopy cover could lead
to harvesting and shifting agriculture being referred to as
deforestation and to regeneration being referred to as refor-
estation, thus creating additional areas of lands under Article
3.3. If the definition of a forest was based on the potential
canopy cover at maturity under planned land-use practices,
harvesting/regeneration activities may not fall under Article
3.3. (2.2.2, 2.2.3, 3.2]

Some commonly used definitions of reforestation include the
activity of regenerating trees immediately after disturbance
or harvesting where no land-use change occurs. If, for exam-
ple, the definition of deforestation or the accounting system
do not include disturbance and harvesting, then emissions
from a harvested stand will not be accounted for. In this
particular example, uptake due to regeneration would be
accounted for, resulting in potentially significant credits for
which a corresponding net removal of carbon from the
atmosphere would not occur. This issue could be considered
when developing the accounting system. [2.2.3.2]

There are several consequences of using definitions that lead

"Notes: n/a = no number is provided because the area of regeneration after harvest in the tropical region and part of the temperate region was not available. In addition, regeneration after selective cutting, as it is often
used in the tropics, is difficult to capture with the FAO Definitional Scenario. It i umed that recent area conversion rates [“recent” = for Annex I Parties AR late 1980s/early 1990s and for D 1980s (except for Canada
and Russian Federation early 1990s); ARD in other regions 1980s] have applied since 1990, and will continue to do so until 2012. The IPCC Definitional Scenario includes transitions between forest and non-forest land
uses under Article 3.3. For the purposes of this table, it is assumed that not only planting, but also other forms of stand establishment such as natural establishment, are considered AR activities. The FAO Definitional
Scenario includes the harvest/regeneration cycle, because regeneration is defined as reforestation. Within the FAO Definitional Scenario, three accounting approaches are distinguished (see paragraph 25 and Section
3.3.2). Uptake rates are intended to span the range within which the average value for each region is expected to be. The lower bound of the estimated average annual stock change corresponds to the lower uptake rate in
AR and the higher bound to the higher uptake rate. Trees have been assumed to grow according to a sigmoidal growth curve. Estimated area for conversion between non-forest and forest should be regarded as an upper
limit for the temperate region total and the tropical region, because some countries may have reported plantations for 1990 but not for 1980, and because some of the plantations may not qualify as resulting from AR
activities under the IPCC Definitional Scenario. Also, for tropical countries, the deforestation estimates are very uncertain and could be in error by as much as +50%.

interpretation, it is, in principle, possible to choose either a

"9. The term “broad activity” means an activity definition that
is land- or area-based, where the net effect of all practices
applied within the same area are included. A broad activity
definition is likely to require land-based accounting (see
paragraph 34). This definitional approach would capture
the net emission or removal effects of practices that deplete
carbon stocks as well as those that increase removals by
sinks. Broad activity definitions, particularly in cases where
land-use change is involved, may make it difficult to separate
human-induced changes from naturally-induced changes.

practices, such as reduced tillage or irrigation water man-

based accounting, but land-based accounting is also possible.
Under activity-based accounting, discrete definitions and
associated rates of emissions or removals are needed for
each individual practice. Narrow definitions raise the poten-
tial for multiple activities to occur on a single land area,
raising accounting issues (see paragraph 33). Narrow activ-
ity definitions may facilitate the separation of human-induced
changes from natural influences (see paragraph 45). [4.2.1,

reforested or afforested between 1990 and 2008 but
stocks are reduced either by harvesting or natural

the forest area and possibly carbon stocks may have
increased since 1990, a debit could be recorded in a

under Article 3.3 or 3.4 where fires or pest outbreaks occur
in a forest, a question is whether accounting should, inter
alia: (i) count neither the loss nor subsequent uptake of car-
bon (which reflects the actual net change in carbon stocks on
those lands and exchange of carbon with the atmosphere in
the long term, but creates problems in continuing to account
for the area burnt/defoliated as lands under Article 3.3 or 3.4);
(ii) count both the loss and subsequent uptake of carbon
(which reflects the actual net change in carbon stocks on
those lands and exchange of carbon with the atmosphere, but
creates an initial carbon debit for the Party concerned);
(iii) count only the loss of carbon (which would overestimate
the actual losses of carbon stocks, not represent the
exchanges of carbon with the atmosphere, and create future
accounting problems); or (iv) count only the subsequent

defining the applicable activities, and in the next step iden-

could be difficult to factor out the impact on stocks of indi-

emission estimates would also need to be accounted for.
Modifications could be made regarding, for example, base-
lines, leakage, timing issues, permanence, and uncertainties.

"33. An “activity-based” approach to accounting would start
with the carbon stock change in applicable carbon pools
and/or emissions/removal of greenhouse gases attributable
to designated LULUCF activities. After defining the applic-
able activities, each applicable activity’s impact on carbon
stocks is determined per unit area and time unit. This impact
is multiplied by the area on which each activity occurs and
by the years it is applied or the years of the commitment peri-
od. Modifications could be made regarding, for example,
baselines, leakage, timing issues, permanence, and uncer-
tainties. Aggregate accounted emissions and removals are
calculated by summing across applicable activities.
Potentially a given area of land could be counted more than

"accounting. In this case, the carbon stock would be especially
difficult to verify. Alternatively, the Parties could decide
that each land unit could contain no more than a single
activity. In this case, the combined impact of multiple prac-
tices applied in the same area would be considered a single
activity. [2.3.2, 3.3.2, 4.3.3]

The land-based approach to accounting could start either
with the start of the activity or run for the entire commitment
period, while the activity-based approach would start when
the activity starts or at the beginning of the commitment peri-
od, whichever is later. Either accounting approach could
end according to decisions that the Parties might adopt. In the
activity-based approach, stock changes prior to the start of
the activity would not be accounted, even if they occur in a
commitment period. [2.3.2]

. Some activities must be persistently maintained to retain the

stored carbon stocks, and this may influence the accounting
methods required. Conservation tillage, for example, may
increase carbon stocks on cropland if carried on continu-
ously, but where it is practiced for a time, then interrupted by
a year of intensive tillage brought on by, for example, a
weather situation or crop change, much of the previous
multi-year gain in soil carbon can be lost. Land-based esti-
mates of the cropland estate should reflect the net effect of

pools and the costs vary significantly. A conservative
approach that would allow for selective accounting of carbon
pools to reduce monitoring costs could be to include all
those pools anticipated to have reduced carbon stocks while
omitting selected pools anticipated, with a sufficient level of
certainty, to have unchanged or increased carbon stocks.
Similar approaches could be used for fluxes of non-CO2
greenhouse gases. Under this approach, verifiability would
mean that only increases in carbon stocks and removal by

"36. For technical reasons, only emissions and removals of COy
can be determined directly as changes in carbon stocks.
Methane emissions and removals cannot in practice be direct-
ly measured as carbon stock changes, although CH4 and
N20 can be determined by other means. Methane and nitrous
oxide emissions from many land-use activities are included
in Annex A of the Kyoto Protocol (e.g., rice cultivation,
enteric fermentation, and agricultural soils) and in the Revised
1996 IPCC Reporting Guidelines for National Greenhouse
Gas Inventories, and therefore they will be captured in
national inventories. This is not the case, however, for emis-
sions of these gases related to forestry activities and projects,
which are not included in Annex A, although some of these
forestry activities are discussed in the 1996 Revised IPCC
Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. If the
net emissions of CH4 and N20 are not considered, the full
climate impact of forestry activities may not be reflected in
the accounting system under the Kyoto Protocol. The treat-
ment of CH4 and NO emissions under Article 3.3 may
deserve further consideration and clarification. For agreed
activities, Article 3.4 leaves open how net greenhouse gas
emissions will be accounted for in meeting the commit-
ments under Article 3.1 of the Protocol. [2.3.2, 3.3.2]

established principles for estimation of emissions and
removals in greenhouse gas inventories. [2.3.7]

Changes in carbon stocks in wood products could potentially
be accounted as part of the activity that is the source of the
wood products or as an independent wood products man-
agement activity. If management of wood products is treat-
ed as an additional activity under Article 3.4, then it may be
necessary to exclude wood products from accounting under
other Article 3.3 or 3.4 activities to avoid double-counting.
Once wood products are in trade, they would be difficult in
most instances to trace. The current IPCC default approach
assumes that the wood product pool remains constant over
time, and therefore does not account for it. However, if this
pool is changing significantly over time, a potentially impor-
tant pool may not be accounted for. [2.4.2, 3.3.2, 4.5.6,
6.3.3]

Enhancement of carbon stocks resulting from land use,
land-use change, and forestry activities is potentially
reversible through human activities, disturbances, or envi-
ronmental change, including climate change. This potential
reversibility is a characteristic feature of LULUCF activi-
ties in contrast to activities in other sectors. This potential
reversibility and nonpermanence of stocks may require
attention with respect to accounting, for example, by ensur-
ing that any credit for enhanced carbon stocks is balanced
by accounting for any subsequent reductions in those
carbon stocks, regardless of the cause. [2.3.6, 3.3.2]

Contiguous commitment periods under the Kyoto Protocol
would avoid incentives in subsequent periods to concen-
trate activities that reduce carbon stocks in time periods that
were not covered. [2.3.2]

Policies by governments or other institutions (e.g., land
tenure reform and tax incentives) may provide a framework
and incentives for implementing LULUCF activities.
Changes in markets may also affect the economic conditions
for land use, land-use change, and forestry activities. The
ability to measure the impact of these conditions and incen-
tives will depend, in part, upon the carbon inventory and
monitoring system in each country. However, it may be very
difficult for countries to assess the relative impact of policies
by governments or other institutions compared to other
human and natural factors that drive changes in carbon
stocks. [2.3.5, 5.2.2]

models based on accepted principles of statistical analysis,
forest inventory, remote-sensing techniques, flux measure-
ments, soil sampling, and ecological surveys. These
methods vary in accuracy, precision, verifiability, cost, and
scale of application. The cost of measuring changes in
carbon stocks and net greenhouse gas emissions for a given
area increases as both desired precision and landscape

"49. Leakage is changes in emissions and removals of greenhouse
gases outside the accounting system that result from activ-
ities that cause changes within the boundary of the account-
ing system. There are four types of leakage: activity dis-
placement, demand displacement, supply displacement, and
investment crowding. If leakage occurs, then the accounting
system will fail to give a complete assessment of the true
aggregate changes induced by the activity. Although leakage
is in many cases a negative effect, situations, such as the
demonstration effect of new management approaches or
technology adoption, may occur where the emissions reduc-
tions or removals of greenhouse gases extend beyond the
accounting system boundaries (positive spillover effect).
For some activities and project types, leakage may be
addressed by increasing the spatial and temporal scale of the
accounting system boundaries (i.e., by including areas where
changes in removal and emissions of greenhouse gases may
be induced). However, leakage may extend beyond any
activity accounting boundaries (e.g., beyond national bound-
aries). Leakage is of particular concern in project-level
accounting, but may also occur with activities under Articles

Temovals Could be potentially large Compared to the com-
mitments in the first commitment period. This could be a sig-
nificant issue in the design of an accounting framework.
[2.3.3]

The Kyoto Protocol specifies that accounting under Article
3.3 be restricted to “direct human-induced land-use change
and forestry activities, limited to afforestation, reforesta-
tion, and deforestation” occurring since 1990. For activities
that involve land-use changes (e.g., from grassland/ pas-
ture to forest) it may be very difficult, if not impossible, to
distinguish with present scientific tools that portion of the
observed stock change that is directly human-induced from
that portion that is caused by indirect and natural factors.
(2.3.4, 3.3.2]

For those activities where only narrowly defined manage-
ment changes under Article 3.4 are involved (e.g.,
conservation tillage) and the land use remains the same, it
may be feasible to factor out partially natural variability
and indirect effects. One approach may be to subtract the
stock changes on comparison plots where there have been
no changes in management practice from changes
measured on plots with modified management activities. In
most cases, experimental manipulation or paired plots can
be used for this purpose, but they are likely to be expensive
to apply over large areas. Ecosystem models can also be
used but need further improvement to decrease uncertain-
ties. Verifiability could be assisted by the application of a
combination of models and measurements. [2.3.4, 4.3.4]

Baselines could be used in some cases to distinguish between
the effects of LULUCF activities and other factors, such as
natural variability and the indirect effects of human activi-
ties, as well as to factor out the effects of business-as-usual
and activities undertaken prior to 1990 on carbon stock
accounts and net greenhouse gas emissions. If the concept
of a baseline was to be applied in national accounting for
activities under Article 3.4, there are many options, which
include: (i) the stock/flux change that would have resulted
from “business-as-usual” activities; (ii) the stock/flux change
that would have resulted from the continuation of 1990
activity levels; (iii) the stock/flux change that would result
in the absence of active management; (iv) performance
benchmarks or standard management practice; and (v) the
rate of change of stocks/fluxes in 1990. The first three of
these baseline options may involve the use of a counterfac-
tual scenario. One difficulty with the use of counterfactual
baselines is verification. [2.3.4, 4.6, 4.6.3.3]

Article 3.3 of the Kyoto Protocol produce different esti-
mates of changes in carbon stocks. There are seven
Definitional Scenarios described in Chapter 3 of the under-
lying report. Table 3 illustrates, with data and methods avail-
able at the time of the Special Report, the estimated carbon
stock changes accounted from ARD activities under the
IPCC and FAO Definitional Scenarios, assuming recent area
conversion rates remain constant and excluding carbon in
soils and wood products. Three different carbon accounting
approaches have been applied to the FAO Definitional
Scenario to illustrate the effect of different accounting
approaches. [3.5.3, 3.5.4, Table 3-4, Table 3-17]

The IPCC Definitional Scenario yields estimates of average
annual accounted carbon stock changes from afforestation
and reforestation in Annex I Parties from 2008 to 2012 of 7
to 46 MtC yr-!. This would be offset by annual changes in
carbon stocks from deforestation of about -90 Mt C yr-!, pro-
ducing a net stock change of -83 to—44 Mt C yrr-!. If hypo-
thetically, for example, afforestation and reforestation rates
were to be increased in Annex I Parties by 20%4 for the
years 2000 to 2012, estimated annual changes in carbon
stocks would increase (from 7 to 46 Mt Cyrr-!) to 7 to 49 Mt
C yrr-!. If hypothetically, for example, deforestation rates
were to be decreased by 20%, estimated annual losses of car-
bon stocks due to deforestation would reduce (from —90 Mt
C yrr-}) to -72 Mt C yrr-!. [3.5.4]

. The three accounting approaches under the FAO Definitional

Scenario yield different results. Estimated average annual
carbon stock changes in Annex | Parties from afforestation
and reforestation are —759 to -243 Mt C yrr-! under the
FAO land-based I approach; —190 to 295 Mt C yrr~! under the
FAO land-based II approach; and 87 to 573 Mt C yr~! under

al carbon stock changes from deforestation are about -90 Mt

"significant areas subject to an activity may be lost in the
averaging process. For example, if forests and deforestation
are defined in terms of canopy cover and canopy cover is
assessed over land areas of 100 ha, then deforestation of
smaller areas within a unit may not take the canopy cover
of the unit below the forest definition threshold. Thus,
changes in carbon stocks may not be accounted and, like-
wise, afforestation or reforestation of small areas may not
be accounted. Hence, there are clear tradeoffs between an
accurate and precise assessment of changes in carbon
stocks and cost. However, an appropriate design should
result in a statistically reliable estimate. [2.2.2]

. The technical capacity required by Annex I Parties to mea-

sure, monitor, and verify carbon stock changes and net
greenhouse gas emissions under the Kyoto Protocol will be
significantly affected by decisions of the Parties regarding
definitions of key terms related to land use, land-use change,
and forestry activities. It will also depend on decisions on,
inter alia, additional activities that may be included under
Article 3.4, and whether additional activities are defined
broadly or narrowly. Depending upon decisions that may be
made, establishing a monitoring, reporting, and verification
system under Articles 3.3 and 3.4 is likely to involve a sig-
nificant effort by Annex I Parties, given the technology,
data, and resources required, and the short time available.
(2.4.1, 3.4, 4.3.2, 4.3.5]

. Annex I Parties generally have the basic technical capacity

(soil and forest inventories, land-use surveys, and informa-
tion based on remote-sensing and other methods) to measure
carbon stocks and net greenhouse gas emissions in terrestrial
ecosystems. However, few, if any, countries perform all of
these measurements routinely, particularly soil inventories.
Some Annex I Parties may use existing capacity with mini-
mal modification to implement the various Articles in the
Kyoto Protocol; however, some other Annex I Parties may
need to improve significantly their existing measurement sys-
tems in order to develop operational systems. Non-Annex I
Parties may require technical, institutional, and financial
assistance and capacity building for measuring, monitor-
ing, and verifying carbon stock changes as well as for
estimating net greenhouse gas emissions. [2.4.6, 3.4.3, 4.2]

. Technical methods for measuring and estimating changes in

forest carbon stocks in aboveground biomass over a five-year
commitment period may be deemed to be sensitive enough
to serve the requirements of the Protocol. Sensitive methods
for estimating below-ground carbon stocks also exist.
However, changes in soil carbon stocks are in some instances

small and difficult to assess accurately over a five-year time

of implementing the Kyoto Protocol. A consideration o
carbon stocks changes and net emissions of greenhouse gas
emissions associated with additional activities on managed
lands entails synthesizing available technical and scientific
data, outlining the outcomes of one policy scenario, and
assessing the aggregate impact of policies and other factors.
The scientific literature to support such an analysis is cur-
rently quite limited. [4.3]

One such scenario is presented in Table 4, to illustrate in a
general sense the potential scope for carbon stock increas-
es through some broadly defined activities. It provides data
and information on carbon stock changes for some candidate
activities under Article 3.4 for the year 2010. This scenario
relies on three components relating to the candidate activi-
ties: (1) an estimate of current relevant land areas (column
2); (2) an assumed percentage of those lands on which an
activity would be applied in 2010 (column 3); and (3) a
research-derived estimate of the annual rate of carbon stock
increase per hectare (column 4). The uptake rate is multiplied
by the applicable land area to approximately calculate the
change in carbon stock in the year 2010 (column 5).

by annual changes in carbon stocks from deforestation of
about —1 788 Mt C yrr-!, producing a net stock change of
-1591 to -1204 Mt C yr. If, hypothetically, for
example, afforestation and reforestation rates were to be
increased globally by 20% for the years 2000 to 2012, esti-
mated annual changes in carbon stocks would increase
(from 197 to 584 Mt C yr-!) to 208 to 629 Mt C yr!.
[3.5.4]

In the IPCC Definitional Scenario and FAO Definitional
Scenario with land-based I accounting approach, the
accounted carbon stock changes are broadly consistent with
the 2008-2012 actual changes in carbon stocks from land
under Article 3.3. The IPCC and FAO Definitional Scenarios
bring different amounts of land under Article 3.3, hence the
estimated carbon stock changes in Table 3 differ.

In the FAO Definitional Scenario with land-based II and
activity-based accounting approaches, the accounted carbon
stock change is not consistent with the 2008-2012 actual
changes in carbon stocks on land under Article 3.3, except
in the case of short rotation cycles.

In neither of the two Definitional Scenarios is the account-
ed carbon stock change consistent with the 2008-2012 actu-
al carbon stock changes, nor with the net exchanges with the
atmosphere, at the national and global levels in part because
the land under Article 3.3 is small in comparison with the
national and global forest area. [3.3.2, 3.5.4]

and social aspects of the activity, and landowner response to
incentives, among other factors. Thus, the total annual stock
changes in Table 4 (column 5) are likely to be on the high side.

Table 4 estimates do not necessarily represent credits under
Article 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol, even if such levels of
stock change are achieved, because the Protocol may include
approaches that limit the applicability of these calculations.

Table 4 illustrates the estimated carbon stock changes from
example additional activities within Annex I and globally,
assuming roughly similar levels of policy support. For exam-
ple, Table 4 suggests that although conversion of cropland to
grassland can provide a relatively large carbon stock increase
per hectare converted, forest management improvements,
which can be applied over a larger land base, may provide
relatively larger total annual increases. Very different esti-
mates in changes of emissions and removals associated with
options for additional land use, land-use change, and forestry
activities would result from different definitions of additional
activities that might be agreed under Article 3.4, different
accounting approaches, and different decisions that might be
taken on implementation rules for Article 3.4.

There is potential for carbon uptake into biomass, which may
be stored over a time period of decades in wood products.
Furthermore, biomass used for energy purposes, based on
waste by-products of wood/crops or from trees/crops grown
expressly for this purpose, has the potential to lead to a
reduction in net greenhouse gas emissions by substituting for
fossil fuels. [1.4.3, 1.4.4]

Table 4 does not account for the possibly significant non-
CO) greenhouse gas emissions and removals that could be
influenced by the candidate activities. For example, the
rates do not reflect net emissions of CHy or N2O from agri-
cultural practices or wetlands/nermafrost manacement. The

cover, in most instances, inter alia, costs for infrastructure,
monitoring, data collection and interpretation costs, oppor-
tunity costs of land and maintenance, or other recurring
costs, which are often excluded or overlooked. Recognizing
the different methods used, the undiscounted cost and invest-

the overall consideration of the climate change mitigation
effects of a project may require assessments beyond
the project boundary, as addressed in paragraph 49. [2.3,
5.3.3]

Project accounting and monitoring methods could be
matched with project conditions to address leakage issues. If
leakage is likely to be small, then the monitoring area can be
set roughly equal to the project area. Conversely, where
leakage is likely to be significant the monitoring area could
be expanded beyond the project area, although this would be
more difficult when the leakage occurs across national
boundaries. Two possible approaches could then be used to
estimate leakage. One would be to monitor key indicators of
leakage, and the second would be to use standard risk coef-
ficients developed for project type and region. In either case,
leakage could be quantified and subsequently changes in car-
bon stock and greenhouse gas emissions attributed to the pro-
ject could be reestimated. The effectiveness of these two
approaches is untested. [5.3.3]

ficients developed for project type and region. In either case,
leakage could be quantified and subsequently changes in car-
bon stock and greenhouse gas emissions attributed to the pro-
ject could be reestimated. The effectiveness of these two
approaches is untested. [5.3.3]

LULUCF projects raise a particular issue with respect to
permanence (see paragraph 40). Different approaches have
been proposed to address the duration of projects in rela-
tion to their ability to increase carbon stocks and decrease
greenhouse gas emissions, inter alia: (i) They should be
maintained in perpetuity because their “reversal” at any
point in time could invalidate a project; and (ii) they should
be maintained until they counteract the effect of an equiva-
lent amount of greenhouse gases emitted to the
atmosphere. [5.3.4]

Several approaches could be used to estimate the changes in
carbon stocks and greenhouse gas emissions of LULUCF
projects: (i) estimating carbon stocks and greenhouse gas
emissions at a given point in time; (ii) estimating the average
changes of carbon stocks or greenhouse gas emissions over
time in a project area; or (iii) allowing for only a part of the
total changes in carbon stocks or greenhouse gas emissions
for each year that the project is maintained (e.g., tonne-year
method). The year-to-year distribution of changes in carbon
stocks and greenhouse gas emissions over the project dura-
tion varies according to the accounting method used. [5.4.2,
Table 5-9]

LULUCF projects are subject to a variety of risks because
of their exposure to natural and anthropogenic factors.
Some of these risks particularly pertain to land-use activi-
ties (e.g., fires, extreme meteorological events, and pests
for forests), while others are applicable to greenhouse gas
mitigation projects in both LULUCF and energy sectors
such as political and economic risks. Risk reduction could

Several sustainable development principles are incorporat-
ed in other multilateral environmental agreements, includ-
ing the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity,
the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification,
and the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. Consideration
may be given to the development of synergies between
LULUCF activities and projects that contribute to the miti-
gation or adaptation to climate change with the goals and the
objectives of these and other relevant multilateral environ-
mental agreements. [2.5.2]

Some of the more formal approaches to sustainable devel-
opment assessment that could be applied at the project level
are, for example, environmental and socioeconomic impact
assessments. These methods have been applied across a
wide range of countries and site-specific activities to date and
could be modified to be applicable to LULUCF projects.
[2.5.2.2]

Some critical factors affecting the sustainable development
contributions of LULUCF activities and projects to mitigate
and adapt to climate change include: institutional and tech-
nical capacity to develop and implement guidelines and
procedures; extent and effectiveness of local community
participation in development, implementation, and distrib-
ution of benefits; and transfer and adoption of technology.

Consideration would need to be given to synergies and
tradeoffs related to LULUCF activities under the UNFCCC
and its Kyoto Protocol in the context of sustainable devel-
opment including a broad range of environmental, social, and
economic impacts, such as: (i) biodiversity; (ii) the quanti-
ty and quality of forests, grazing lands, soils, fisheries, and
water resources; (iii) the ability to provide food, fiber, fuel,
and shelter; and (iv) employment, human health, poverty, and
equity. [2.5.1, 3.6]

For example, converting non-forest land to forest will typi-
cally increase the diversity of flora and fauna, except in sit-
uations where biologically diverse non-forest ecosystems,
such as native grasslands, are replaced by forests consisting
of single or a few species. Afforestation can also have high-
ly varied impacts on groundwater supplies, river flows, and
water quality. [3.6.1]

A system of criteria and indicators could be used to assess
and compare sustainable development impacts across
LULUCF alternatives. While there are no agreed
upon set of criteria and indicators, several sets are being
developed for closely related purposes, for example assess-
ment of contributions to sustainable development by the
United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development.
