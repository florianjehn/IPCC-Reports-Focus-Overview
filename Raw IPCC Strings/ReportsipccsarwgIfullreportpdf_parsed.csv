We believe the essential message of this report continues
to be that the basic understanding of climate change and the
human role therein, as expressed in the 1990 report, still
holds: carbon dioxide remains the most important
contributor to anthropogenic forcing of climate change;
projections of future global mean temperature change and
sea level rise confirm the potential for human activities to
alter the Earth’s climate to an extent unprecedented in
human history; and the long time-scales governing both the
accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and
the response of the climate system to those accumulations,
means that many important aspects of climate change are
effectively irreversible. Further, that observations suggest

quantified but which is defined as one that will “prevent
dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate
system”. Because the definition of “dangerous” will
depend on value judgements as well as upon observable
physical changes in the climate system, such policies will
not rest on purely scientific grounds, and the companion
IPCC reports by WGII on Impacts, Adaptations and
Mitigation of Climate Change, and by WGIII on Economic

the background information on which the wider debate will
be based. Together the three WG reports establish a basis
for an IPCC synthesis of information relevant to
interpreting Article 2 of the FCCC. An important
contribution of WGI to this synthesis has been an analysis
of the emission pathways for carbon dioxide that would
lead to a range of hypothetical stabilisation levels.

"This report is the most comprehensive assessment of the
science of climate change since Working Group I (WGI) of
the IPCC produced its first report Climate Change: The
IPCC Scientific Assessment in 1990. It enlarges and
updates information contained in that assessment and also
in the interim reports produced by WGI in 1992 and 1994.
The first IPCC Assessment Report of 1990 concluded that
continued accumulation of anthropogenic greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere would lead to climate change whose rate
and magnitude were likely to have important impacts on
natural and human systems. The IPCC Supplementary
Report of 1992, timed to coincide with the final
negotiations of the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change in Rio de Janeiro (June 1992), added
new quantitative information on the climatic effects of
aerosols but confirmed the essential conclusions of the
1990 assessment concerning our understanding of climate
and the factors affecting it. The 1994 WGI report Radiative
Forcing of Climate Change examined in depth the
mechanisms that govern the relative importance of human
and natural factors in giving rise to radiative forcing, the
“driver” of climate change. The 1994 report incorporated
further advances in the quantification of the climatic effects
of aerosols, but it also found no reasons to alter in any
fundamental way those conclusions of the 1990 report
which it addressed.

"At present some long-lived greenhouse gases
(particularly HFCs (a CFC substitute), PFCs and
SF6) contribute little to radiative forcing but their
projected growth could contribute several per cent to
radiative forcing during the 21st century.

If carbon dioxide emissions were maintained at near
current (1994) levels, they would lead to a nearly
constant rate of increase in atmospheric
concentrations for at least two centuries, reaching
about 500 ppmv (approaching twice the pre-
industrial concentration of 280 ppmv) by the end of
the 21st century.

A range of carbon cycle models indicates that
stabilisation of atmospheric CO, concentrations at
450, 650 or 1000 ppmv could be achieved only if
global anthropogenic CO, emissions drop to 1990
levels by, respectively, approximately 40, 140 or 240
years from now, and drop substantially below 1990
levels subsequently.

Any eventual stabilised concentration is governed
more by the accumulated anthropogenic CO,
emissions from now until the time of stabilisation,
than by the way those emissions change over the
period. This means that, for a given stabilised
concentration value, higher emissions in early
decades require lower emissions later on. Among the
range of stabilisation cases studied, for stabilisation
at 450, 650 or 1000 ppmv accumulated
anthropogenic emissions over the period 1991 to
2100 are 630 GtC3, 1030 GtC, and 1410 Gtc
respectively (+ approximately 15% in each case).

* The atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases,
inter alia carbon dioxide (CO), methane (CH,) and
nitrous oxide (N,O) have grown significantly: by
about 30%, 145% and 15% respectively (values for
1992). These trends can be attributed largely to
human activities, mostly fossil fuel use, land-use
change and agriculture.

+ The growth rates of CO,, CH, and N,O concentrations
were low during the early 1990s. While this apparently
natural variation is not yet fully explained, recent data
indicate that the growth rates are currently comparable
to those averaged over the 1980s.

¢ The direct radiative forcing of the long-lived
greenhouse gases (2.45 Wm) is due primarily to
increases in the concentrations of CO, (1.56 Wm”),
CH, (0.47 Wm) and N,O (0.14 Wn) (1992 values).

¢ Many greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere for
a long time (for CO, and N,O, many decades to
centuries), hence they affect radiative forcing on long
time-scales,

* The direct radiative forcing due to the CFCs and
HCECs combined is 0.25 Wm’. However, their net
radiative forcing is reduced by about 0.1 Wm’? because
they have caused stratospheric ozone depletion which
gives rise to a negative radiative forcing.

* Growth in the concentration of CFCs, but not
HCFCs, has slowed to about zero. The
concentrations of both CFCs and HCFCs, and their
consequent ozone depletion, are expected to decrease
substantially by 2050 through implementation of the
Montreal Protocol and its Adjustments and
Amendments.

There is evidence that tropospheric ozone
concentrations in the Northern Hemisphere have
increased since pre-industrial times because of human
activity and that this has resulted in a positive radiative
forcing. This forcing is not yet well characterised, but
it is estimated to be about 0.4 Wm? (15% of that from
the long-lived greenhouse gases). However the

particles) resulting from combustion of fossil fuels,
biomass burning and other sources have led to a

average, and possibly also to a negative indirect
forcing of a similar magnitude. While the negative
forcing is focused in particular regions and
subcontinental areas, it can have continental to
hemispheric scale effects on climate patterns.

Locally, the aerosol forcing can be large enough to
more than offset the positive forcing due to
greenhouse gases.

In contrast to the long-lived greenhouse gases,
anthropogenic aerosols are very short-lived in the
atmosphere, hence their radiative forcing adjusts
rapidly to increases or decreases in emissions.

Recent years have been among the warmest since
1860, i.e., in the period of instrumental record, despite
the cooling effect of the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo volcanic
eruption.

Night-time temperatures over land have generally
increased more than daytime temperatures.

Regional changes are also evident. For example, the
recent warming has been greatest over the mid-
latitude continents in winter and spring, with a few
areas of cooling, such as the North Atlantic ocean.
Precipitation has increased over land in high latitudes
of the Northern Hemisphere, especially during the
cold season.

Global sea level has risen by between 10 and 25 cm
over the past 100 years and much of the rise may be
related to the increase in global mean temperature.

There are inadequate data to determine whether
consistent global changes in climate variability or
weather extremes have occurred over the 20th century.
On regional scales there is clear evidence of changes
in some extremes and climate variability indicators
(e.g., fewer frosts in several widespread areas; an
increase in the proportion of rainfall from extreme
events over the contiguous states of the USA). Some
of these changes have been toward greater variability;
some have been toward lower variability.

assuming the “best estimate” values of climate
sensitivity and of ice melt sensitivity to warming, and
including the effects of future changes in aerosol,
models project an increase in sea level of about 50
cm from the present to 2100. This estimate is
approximately 25% lower than the “best estimate” in
1990 due to the lower temperature projection, but
also reflecting improvements in the climate and ice

highest emission scenario (IS92e) combined with

level rise of about 95 cm from the present to 2100.

one third lower than the “best estimate” in 1990. This
is due primarily to lower emission scenarios
(particularly for CO, and the CFCs), the inclusion of
the cooling effect of sulphate aerosols, and
improvements in the treatment of the carbon cycle.
Combining the lowest IPCC emission scenario
(IS92c) with a “low” value of climate sensitivity and
including the effects of future changes in acrosol
concentrations leads to a projected increase of about
1°C by 2100. The corresponding projection for the

warming would probably be greater than any seen in
the last 10,000 years, but the actual annual to decadal
changes would include considerable natural
variability. Regional temperature changes could
differ substantially from the global mean value.
Because of the thermal inertia of the oceans, only 50-

would continue to increase beyond 2100, even if

changes.

Confidence is higher in the hemispheric-to-
continental scale projections of coupled atmosphere-
ocean climate models than in the regional
projections, where confidence remains low. There is
more confidence in temperature projections than
hydrological changes.

All model simulations, whether they were forced
with increased concentrations of greenhouse gases
and aerosols or with increased concentrations of
greenhouse gases alone, show the following features:
greater surface warming of the land than of the sea in
winter; a maximum surface warming in high northern
fatitudes in winter, little surface warming over the
Arctic in summer; an enhanced global mean
hydrological cycle, and increased precipitation and
soil moisture in high latitudes in winter. All these
changes are associated with identifiable physical
mechanisms.

fn addition, most simulations show a reduction in the
strength of the north Atlantic thermohaline
circulation and a widespread reduction in diurnal
range of temperature. These features too can be
explained in terms of identifiable physical
mechanisms.

The direct and indirect effects of anthropogenic
aerosols have an important effect on the projections.
Generally, the magnitudes of the temperature and
precipitation changes are smaller when aerosol
effects are represented, especially in northern mid-
latitudes, Note that the cooling effect of aerosols is
not a simple offset to the warming effect of
greenhouse gases, but significantly affects some of
the continental scale patterns of climate change, most
noticeably in the summer hemisphere. For example,
models that consider only the effects of greenhouse
gases generally project an increase in precipitation
and soil moisture in the Asian summer monsoon
region, whereas models that include, in addition,
some of the effects of aerosols suggest that monsoon
precipitation may decrease. The spatial and temporal
distribution of aerosols greatly influence regional
projections, which are therefore more uncertain.

non-linear systems are especially subject to unexpected

as a result of human activity, leading to significant climate
change in the coming century. The projected changes in

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (FCCC) uses the term “climate change” to refer
exclusively to change brought about by human activities. A
more generic usage is common in the scientific community
where it is necessary to be able to refer to change arising
from any source. In particular scientists refer to past
climate change and address the complex issue of separating
natural and human causes in currently observed changes.
However, the climate projections covered in this document
relate only to future climate changes resulting from human
influences, since it is not yet possible to predict the
fluctuations due to voicanoes and other natural influences.
Consequently the use of the term “climate change” here,
when referring to future change, is essentially the same as
the usage adopted in the FCCC.

"The first Scientific Assessment in 1990 concluded that
the increase in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse
gases since the pre-industrial period! had altered the energy
balance of the Earth/atmosphere and that global warming
would result. Model simulations of global warming due to
the observed increase of greenhouse gas concentrations over
the past century tended towards a central estimate of about
1°C while analysis of the instrumental temperature record,
on the other hand, revealed warming of around 0.5°C over
the same period. The 1990 report concluded: “The size of
this warming is broadly consistent with predictions of
climate models, but it is also of the same magnitude as
natural climate variability. Thus the observed increase could
be largely due to this natural variability; alternatively this
variability and other human factors could have offset a still

larger human-induced greenhouse warming.”

Anthropogenic aerosols (small particles) in the troposphere, derived mainly from the emission of sulphur dioxide
from fossil fuel burning, and derived from other sources such as biomass burning, can absorb and reflect solar
radiation, In addition, changes in aerosol concentrations can alter cloud amount and cloud reflectivity through their
effect on cloud properties. In most cases tropospheric aerosols tend to produce a negative radiative forcing and cool
climate. They have a much shorter lifetime (days to weeks) than most greenhouse gases (decades to centuries) so their
concentrations respond much more quickly to changes in emissions.

Any human-induced changes in climate will be superimposed on a background of natural climatic variations which
occur on a whole range of space- and time-scales, Natural climate variability can occur as a result of changes in the
forcing of the climate system, for example due to aerosol derived from volcanic eruptions. Climate variations can also
occur in the absence of a change in external forcing, as a result of complex interactions between components of the
climate system such as the atmosphere and ocean. The El Nifio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon is an
example of such natural “internal” variability. To distinguish anthropogenic climate changes from natural variations, it
is necessary to identify the anthropogenic “signal” against the background “noise” of natural climate variability.

The estimate of the 1980s’ carbon budget (Table 2)
remains essentially unchanged from IPCC (1994). While
recent data on anthropogenic emissions are available, there
are insufficient analyses of the other fluxes to allow an
update of this decadal budget to include the early years of
the 1990s. The net release of carbon from tropical land-use
change (mainly forest clearing minus regrowth) is roughly
balanced by carbon accumulation in other land ecosystems
due to forest regrowth outside the tropics, and by transfer to

processes that operate on different time-scales, and is
subsequently transferred to various reservoirs, some of
which eventually return CO, to the atmosphere. Some
simple analyses of CO, changes have used the concept of a
single characteristic time-scale for this gas. Such analyses
are of limited value because a single time-scale cannot
capture the behaviour of CO, under different emission
scenarios. This is in contrast to methane, for example,
whose atmospheric lifetime is dominantly controlled by a
single process: oxidation by OH in the atmosphere. For
CO, the fastest process is uptake into vegetation and the
surface layer of the oceans which occurs over a few years.
Various other sinks operate on the century time-scale (e.g.,
transfer to soils and to the deep ocean) and so have a less
immediate, but no less important, effect on the

forcings associated with the depletion of stratospheric ozone and
the increased concentration of tropospheric ozone are shown in the
second and third bar respectively. The direct contributions of
individual tropospheric aerosol component are grouped into the
next set of three bars. The indirect aerosol effect, arising from the
induced change in cloud properties, is shown next; quantitative
understanding of this process is very limited at present and hence
no bar representing a mid-range estimate is shown. The final bar
shows the estimate of the changes in radiative forcing due to
variations in solar output. The forcing associated with stratospheric
aerosols resulting from volcanic eruptions is not shown, as it is very
variable over this time period. Note that there are substantial
differences in the geographical distribution of the forcing due to the
well-mixed greenhouse gases (mainly CO,, N,O, CH, and the
halocarbons) and that due to ozone and aerosols, which could lead
to significant differences in their respective global and regional

Since IPCC (1994), there have been several advances in
understanding the impact of tropospheric aerosols on climate.
These include: (i) new calculations of the spatial distribution
of sulphate aerosol largely resulting from fossil fuel combus-
tion and (ii) the first calculation of the spatial distribution of
soot aerosol. The impact of these developments on the calcu-
lation of aerosol radiative forcing is discussed in Section B.7.

Acrosols in the atmosphere influence the radiation
balance of the Earth in two ways: (i) by scattering and
absorbing radiation — the direct effect, and (ii) by
modifying the optical properties, amount and lifetime of
clouds — the indirect effect. Although some aerosols, such
as soot, tend to warm the surface, the net climatic effect of
anthropogenic aerosols is believed to be a negative
radiative forcing, tending to cool the surface (see Section
B.7 and Figure 2).

Aerosol is a term used for particles and very small droplets
of natural and human origin that occur in the atmosphere;
they include dust and other particles which can be made up
of many different chemicals. Aerosols are produced by a
variety of processes, both natural (including dust storms
and volcanic activity) and anthropogenic (including fossil
fuel and biomass burning). Aerosols contribute to visible
haze and can cause a diminution of the intensity of sunlight
at the ground.

Most aerosols with anthropogenic sources are found in
the lower troposphere (below 2 km). Aerosols undergo
chemical and physical transformations in the atmosphere,
especially within clouds, and are removed largely by
precipitation. Consequently aerosols in the lower
troposphere typically have residence times of a few days.
Because of their short lifetime, aerosols in the lower
troposphere are distributed inhomogeneously with maxima
close to the natural (especially desert) and anthropogenic
(especially industrial and biomass combustion) source
regions. Aerosol particles resulting from volcanic activity
can reach the stratosphere where they are transported
around the globe over many months or years.

Decreases in stratospheric ozone have occurred since the
1970s, principally in the lower stratosphere. The most
obvious feature is the annual appearance of the Antarctic
“ozone hole” in September and October. The October
average total ozone values over Antarctica are 50-70% lower
than those observed in the 1960s. Statistically significant
losses in total ozone have also been observed in the mid-
latitudes of both hemispheres. Little or no downward trend
in ozone has been observed in the tropics (20°N-20°S). The
weight of recent scientific evidence strengthens the previous
conclusion that ozone loss is due largely to anthropogenic
chlorine and bromine compounds. Since the stratospheric
abundances of chlorine and bromine are expected to
continue to grow for a few more years before they decline
(see Section B.4), stratospheric ozone losses are expected to
peak near the end of the century, with a gradual recovery
throughout the first half of the 21st century.

"b..f Lropospneric Ozone

In the troposphere, ozone is produced during the oxidation
of methane and from various short-lived precursor gases
(mainly carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NO,) and
non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC)). Ozone is also
transported into the troposphere from the stratosphere.
Changes in tropospheric ozone concentration are spatially
variable, both regionally and vertically, making assessment
of global long-term trends difficult. In the Northern
Hemisphere, there is some evidence that tropospheric
ozone concentrations have increased since 1900, with
strong evidence that this has occurred in many locations
since the 1960s. However, the observations of the most
recent decade show that the upward trend has slowed
significantly or stopped. Model simulations and the limited
observations together suggest that ozone concentrations
throughout the troposphere may have doubled in the
Northern Hemisphere since pre-industrial times, an
increase of about 25 ppbv. In the Southern Hemisphere,
there are insufficient data to determine if tropospheric
ozone has changed, except at the South Pole where a
decrease has been observed since the mid-1980s.

Globally averaged radiative forcing is a useful concept for
giving a first-order estimate of the potential climatic
importance of various forcing mechanisms. However, as
was emphasised in IPCC (1994), there are limits to its
utility. In particular, the spatial patterns of forcing differ
between the globally well-mixed greenhouse gases, the
regionally varying tropospheric ozone, and the even more
regionally concentrated tropospheric aerosols, and so a
comparison of the global mean radiative forcings does not
give a complete picture of their possible climatic impact.

"Derivation of GWPs requires knowledge of the fate of

caused a substantial negative radiative forcing since pre-
industrial times, but it remains very difficult to quantify,
more so than the direct effect. While no best estimate of the

The Global Warming Potential is an attempt to provide a
simple measure of the relative radiative effects of the
emissions of various greenhouse gases. The index is
defined as the cumulative radiative forcing between the
present and some chosen time horizon caused by a unit
mass of gas emitted now, expressed relative to that for
some reference gas (here CO, is used). The future global
warming commitment of a greenhouse gas over a chosen
time horizon can be estimated by multiplying the
appropriate GWP by the amount of gas emitted. For
example, GWPs could be used to compare the effects of
reductions in CO, emissions relative to reductions in
methane emissions, for a specified t time horizon.

The total direct forcing due to anthropogenic aerosol
(sulphates, fossil fuel soot and organic aerosols from
biomass burning) is estimated to be -0.5 Wm (range:
-0.25 to -1.0 Wm’). This estimate is smaller than that
given in IPCC (1994) owing to a reassessment of the model
results used to derive the geographic distribution of aerosol
particles and the inclusion of anthropogenic soot aerosol for
the first time. The direct forcing due to sulphate aerosols
resulting from fossil fuel emissions and smelting is estimated
to be -0.4 Wm? (range: -0.2 to -0.8 Wm-). The first
estimates of the impact of soot in aerosols from fossil fuel
sources have been made: significant uncertainty remains but
an estimate of +0.1 Wm? (range: 0.03 to 0.3 Wm) is
made. The direct radiative forcing since 1850 of particles
associated with biomass burning is estimated to be -0.2
Wm (range: -0.07 to -0.6 Wm), unchanged from IPCC
(1994). It has recently been suggested that a significant
fraction of the tropospheric dust aerosol is influenced by
human activities but the radiative forcing of this component

The GWP for methane includes indirect effects of tropospheric ozone production and stratospheric water vapour production, as

The Global Warming Potentials for ozone-depleting substances (including all CFCs, HCFCs and halons, whose direct GWPs have
been given in previous reports) are a sum of a direct (positive) component and an indirect (negative) component which depends
strongly upon the effectiveness of each substance for ozone destruction. Generally, the halons are likely to have negative net

the allowable emissions to achieve stabilisation are up to
10% lower than those in IPCC (1994). In addition, these
calculations have been extended to include alternative
pathways towards stabilisation (Figure 7a) and a higher
stabilisation level (1000 ppmv). The alternative pathways

steeper reductions in emissions in later years (Figure 7b).

"21st century.

In IPCC (1994), carbon cycle models were used to
calculate the emissions of CO, which would lead to
stabilisation at a number of different concentration levels
from 350 to 750 ppmv. The assumed concentration profiles
leading to stabilisation are shown in Figure 7a (excluding
350 ppmv). Many different stabilisation levels, time-scales
for achieving these levels, and routes to stabilisation could
have been chosen. The choices made are not intended to
have policy implications; the exercise is illustrative of the
relationship between CO, emissions and concentrations.
Those in Figure 7a assume a smooth transition from the
current average rate of CO, concentration increase to
stabilisation. To a first approximation, the stabilised
concentration level depends more upon the accumulated
amount of carbon emitted up to the time of stabilisation,
than upon the exact concentration path followed en route to
stabilisation.

were to remain constant at their current (1994) levels (i.e.,

In order to establish whether the 20th century warming is
part of the natural variability of the climate system or a
response to anthropogenic forcing, information is needed
on climate variability on relevant time-scales. As an
average over the Northern Hemisphere for summer, recent
decades appear to be the warmest since at least 1400 from
the limited available evidence (Figure 10). The warming
over the past century began during one of the colder
periods of the last 600 years. Prior to 1400 data are
insufficient to provide hemispheric temperature estimates.
Ice core data from several sites suggest that the 20th
century is at least as warm as any century in the past 600
years, although the recent warming is not exceptional
everywhere.

As discussed in Section B, changes in the radiatively active
trace gases in the atmosphere produce radiative forcing. For
equivalent CO, concentrations equal to twice the pre-
industrial concentration, the positive radiative forcing is
about +4 Wm”. To restore the radiative balance other
changes in climate must occur. The initial reaction is for the
lower atmosphere (the troposphere) and the Earth’s surface to
warm; in the absence of other changes, the warming would
be about 1.2°C. However, heating not only changes
temperatures, but also alters other aspects of the climate
system and various feedbacks are invoked (see Section D.2).
The key role of climate models is to quantify these feedbacks
and determine the overall climate response. Further, the
warming and other climate effects will not be uniform over
the Earth’s surface; an important role of models is to simulate
possible continental and regional scale climate responses.

observed retreat of glaciers and ice-caps may account for
about 2 to 5 cm. Other factors are more difficult to
quantify. Changes in surface and ground water storage may
have caused a small change in sea level over the last 100
years. The rate of observed sea level rise suggests that
there has been a net positive contribution from the huge ice
sheets of Greenland and Antarctica, but observations of the
ice sheets do not yet allow meaningful quantitative
estimates of their separate contributions. The ice sheets

Comprehensive coupled atmosphere-ocean models are very complex and take large computer resources to run. To
explore all the possible scenarios and the effects of assumptions or approximations in parameters in the model more

When a model is employed for climate projection it is first run for many simulated decades without any changes in
external forcing in the system. The quality of the simulation can then be assessed by comparing statistics of the mean
climate, the annual cycle and the variability on different time-scales with observations of the current climate. The
model is then run with changes in external forcing, for instance with changing greenhouse gas concentrations. The

"Future climate is projected using climate models. The most highly developed climate models are atmospheric and
oceanic general circulation models (GCMs). In many instances GCMs of the atmosphere and oceans, developed as
separate models, are combined, to give a coupled GCM (termed here a coupled atmosphere-ocean model). These
models also include representations of land-surface processes, sea ice related processes and many other complex
processes involved in the climate system. GCMs are based upon physical laws that describe the atmospheric and
oceanic dynamics and physics, and upon empirical relationships, and their depiction as mathematical equations. These
equations are solved numerically with computers using a three-dimensional grid over the globe. For climate, typical
resolutions are about 250 km in the horizontal and 1 km in the vertical in atmospheric GCMs, often with higher
vertical resolution near the surface and lower resolution in the upper troposphere and stratosphere. Many physical
processes, such as those related to clouds, take place on much smaller spatial scales and therefore cannot be properly
resolved and modelled explicitly, but their average effects must be included in a simple way by taking advantage of
physically based relationships with the larger scale variables (a technique known as parametrization).

reproduce the seasonal cycle in response to changes in
solar forcing. The improvement since IPCC (1990) is
that this level of accuracy is achieved in models with a
fully-interactive ocean as compared to the majority of
models that employed simpler schemes used in 1990.

Many climate changes are consistently projected by
different models in response to greenhouse gases and
aerosols and can be explained in terms of physical
processes which are known to be operating in the real
world, for example, the maximum warming in high
northern latitudes in winter (see Section F).

The models reproduce with reasonable fidelity other less
obvious variations in climate due to changes in forcing:

Some atmospheric models when forced with observed
sea surface temperature variations can reproduce with
moderate to good skill several regional climate
variations, especially in parts of the tropics and sub-
tropics. For example, aspects of the large scale
interannual atmosphere fluctuations over the tropical
Pacific relating to the El Nifio-Southern Oscillation
phenomenon are captured, as are interannual
variations in rainfall in north-east Brazil and to some
extent decadal variations in rainfall over the Sahel.

As discussed in IPCC (1994), stratospheric aerosols
resulting from the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in June
1991 gave rise to a short-lived negative global mean
radiative forcing of the troposphere which peaked at
-3 to -4 Wm? a few months after the eruption and_
had virtually disappeared by about the end of 1994.
A climate model was used to predict global
temperature variations between the time of the
eruption and the end of 1994 and the results agreed
closely with observations (Figure 14). Such
agreement increases confidence in the ability of
climate models to respond in a realistic way to
transient, planetary-scale radiative forcings of large
magnitude.

since 1990. Primary factors that have served to raise our
confidence are model improvements, e.g., the successful
incorporation of additional physical processes (such as

aerosols) into global coupled models, and the improvement
in such models’ simulation of the observed changes in

Several processes are involved in cloud/radiative feedback.
Clouds can both absorb and reflect solar radiation (which
cools the surface) and absorb and emit long-wave radiation
(which warms the surface), depending on cloud height,
thickness and cloud radiative properties. The radiative
properties of clouds depend on the evolution of atmospheric
water in its vapour, liquid and ice phases and upon
atmospheric aerosols. The processes are complex and,
although considerable progress has been made since IPCC

climate is realistic and hence that climate feedback processes
Operate in the appropriate range in climate change simulations.
Many features of the response of models with and without
flux adjustments to increasing greenhouse gases are
qualitatively similar. The most substantial differences in
simulated climate change can generally be traced to
deficiencies in the simulation of current climate in the
unadjusted models, for example, systematic errors in sea ice.
The main unknown regarding the use of adjustments in
models is the extent to which they allow important non-linear
processes to operate in the models. They have been tested
with a good degree of success against known climate
variations including the seasonal cycle and the perturbations
mentioned above. This provides some confidence in their use
for future climate perturbations caused by human activities.

To better address the attribution problem, a number of
recent studies have compared observations with model-

(“causes”) may have different patterns of response
(“effects”), particularly if one considers the full three- or
even four-dimensional structure of the response, e.g.,
temperature change as a function of latitude, longitude,
height and time. Thus a good match between modelled and

"Tn observed data, any “signal” of human effects on climate
must be distinguished from the background “noise” of
climate fluctuations that are entirely natural in origin. Such
natural fluctuations occur on a variety of space- and time-
scales, and can be purely internal (due to complex
interactions between individual components of the climate
system, such as the atmosphere and ocean) or externally
driven by changes in solar variability or the volcanic
aerosol loading of the atmosphere. It is difficult to separate
a Signal from the noise of natural variability in the
observations. This is because there are large uncertainties
in the evolution and magnitude of both human and natural
forcings, and in the characteristics of natural internal
variability, which translate to uncertainties in the relative
magnitudes of signal and noise.

"In the modelled world, however, it is possible to perform
multi-century control experiments with no human-induced
changes in greenhouse gases, sulphate aerosols or other
anthropogenic forcings. Since 1990, a number of such
control experiments have been performed with coupled
atmosphere-ocean models. These yield important
information on the patterns, time-scales, and magnitude of
the “internally generated” component of natural climate
variability. This information is crucial for assessing
whether observed changes can be plausibly explained by
internal climatic fluctuations, but constitutes only one part
of the “total” natural variability of climate (since such
control runs do not include changes in solar output or
volcanic aerosols). Uncertainties still remain in estimates
of both internal and total natural climate variability,

These global mean results cannot establish a clear cause
and effect link between observed changes in atmospheric
greenhouse gas concentrations and changes in the Earth’s
surface temperature. This is the attribution issue.
Attribution is difficult using global mean changes only
because of uncertainties in the histories and magnitudes of
natural and human-induced forcings: there are many
possible combinations of these forcings that could yield the
same curve of observed global mean temperature change.
Some combinations are more plausible than others, but
relatively few data exist to constrain the range of possible
solutions. Nevertheless, model-based estimates of global
temperature increase over the last 130 years are more
easily reconciled with observations when the likely cooling
effect of sulphate aerosols is taken into account, and
provide qualitative support for an estimated range of

future global temperature to changes in aerosol concentrations,
the same series of calculations were performed neglecting
future aerosol changes, i.c. aerosol concentrations were held
constant at 1990 levels. These lead to higher projections of
temperature change. Taking account of the range in the estimate
of climate sensitivity and the full set of IS92 emission scenatios,
the models project an increase in global mean temperature of

Many models suggest an increase in the probability of
intense precipitation with increased greenhouse gas

show there is also an increase in the probability of dry days
and the length of dry spells (consecutive days without
precipitation). Where mean precipitation decreases, the

"The global climate models used for future projections
are run at fairly coarse resolution and do not
adequately depict many geographic features (such as
coastlines, lakes and mountains), surface vegetation,
and the interactions between the atmosphere with the
surface which become more important on regional
scales. Considerable spread exists among model
projections on the regional scale even when climate
model experiments are driven by the same future
radiative forcing scenario.

There is much more natural variation in local climate
than in climate averaged over continental or larger
scales. This variation arises from locally generated
variability from storms, interactions between the
atmosphere and the oceans (such as ENSO), and
from variations in soil moisture, sea ice, and other
components of the climate system. Series or
ensembles of model predictions started from different
initial conditions allow both the mean climate and the
superimposed variability to be determined.

Because of their uneven spatial distribution, human
induced tropospheric aerosols are likely to greatly
influence future regional climate change. At present,
however, there are very few projections of climate
change with coupled atmosphere-ocean models (the
type of model that gives more reliable information on
the regional scale) which include the radiative effects
of aerosols. Those that have been run include a very
simplified representation of aerosol effects.

Land-use changes are also believed to have a
significant impact on temperature and precipitation
changes, especially in the tropics and subtropics.
Climate model experiments have shown the
likelihood of substantial local climate change
associated with deforestation in the Amazon, or
desertification in the Sahel. Changes in land-use on
small scales which cannot be foreseen are expected
to continue to influence regional climate.

Unexpected external influences, such as volcanic eruptions,

significant changes in the atmospheric circulation

interpreted to suggest that the ocean circulation has been
very different in the past. Both in these observations and in
the ocean models, transitions between different types
of circulation seem to occur on a time-scale of a few
decades, so relatively sudden changes in the regional

presumably mainly in response to precipitation and
runoff changes which alter the salinity, and thus
the density, of the upper layers of the North Atlantic.
Whether or not such a sudden change can actually

Radiative forcing is the perturbation to the energy balance of the Earth-

system responds to the radiative forcing so as to re-establish the energy balance.
A positive radiative forcing tends to warm the surface and a negative radiative
forcing tends to cool the surface. The radiative forcing is normally quoted as a
global and annual mean value. A more precise definition of radiative forcing, as
used in IPCC reports, is the perturbation of the energy balance of the surface-
troposphere system, after allowing for the stratosphere to re-adjust to a state of
global mean radiative equilibrium (see Chapter 4 of IPCC (1994)). Sometimes

Changes in climate, whether from natural variability or
anthropogenic causes and over a range of time-scales, can
be identified and studied from different climate variables.
Because humans live in and breathe the atmosphere it is
natural to focus on the atmospheric changes where
phenomena and events are loosely divided into the realms
of “weather” and “climate”. The large fluctuations in the
atmosphere from hour-to-hour or day-to-day constitute the
weather; they occur as weather systems move, develop,
evolve, mature and decay as forms of atmospheric
turbulence. These weather systems arise mainly from
atmospheric instabilities and their evolution is governed by
non-linear “chaotic” dynamics, so that they are not
predictable in an individual deterministic sense beyond a
week or two into the future.

Nevertheless, for the purposes of the United Nations Convention on Climate Change, the definition of climate
change is: “a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of
the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods.”
Further, the Convention considers, for purposes of mitigation measures, only those greenhouse gases which are not
controlled by the Montreal Protocol and its Amendments (i.e., ozone-depleting substances such as CFCs and the
HCFCs), presumably on the grounds that the latter are covered by a separate international legal instrument. This
definition thus introduces the concept of the difference between climate with the effect of human-induced increase in
the concentration of greenhouse gases and that which would be realised without such human interference. This point is
important scientifically for both detection and prediction because at least one of these climate states has to be modelled.

to the effect of enhanced greenhouse warming, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change defines
the climate system to be “the totality of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere and geosphere and their interactions”.

The concept of climate change has recently acquired a number of different meanings in the scientific literature and
in relevant international fora. There is a simple view that climate change refers to any change of the classical 30-year
climatology, regardless of its causes. Often “climate change” denotes those variations due to human interference while
“climate variations” refers to the natural variations. Sometimes “climate change” designates variations longer than a
certain period. Finally, “climate change” is sometimes taken in the literature to mean climate fluctuations of a global
nature, which is an interpretation used in parts of this report and which includes the effects due to human actions, such
as the enhanced greenhouse effect, and those due to natural causes such as stratospheric aerosols from volcanic
eruptions. One complication with this definition is the anthropogenic changes of climate on a restricted space scale, a
good example of which is the heat island phenomenon by which highly urbanised areas may have a mean temperature
which is higher than it would otherwise have been.

The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has
increased by more than 25% in the past century and since
the beginning of the industrial revolution, an increase
which is known to be in large part due to combustion of
fossil fuels and the removal of forests (Chapter 2). In the
absence of controls, projections are that the future rate of
increase in carbon dioxide amount may accelerate and
concentrations could double from pre-industrial values
within the next 50 to 100 years (IPCC, 1994).

For the Earth, on an annual mean basis, the excess of solar
over outgoing long-wave radiation in the tropics and the
deficit at mid- to high latitudes (Figure 1.2) sets up an
equator-to-pole temperature gradient that results, with the
Earth’s rotation, in a broad band of westerlies in each
hemisphere in the troposphere. Embedded within the mid-
latitude westerlies are large-scale weather systems which,
along with the ocean, act to transport heat polewards to
achieve an overall energy balance. These weather systems
are the familiar migrating cyclones and anticyclones (ie.,

. low and high pressure systems) and their associated cold
and warm fronts.

is that anomalies in climate on seasonal-to-annual time-
scales typically occur over large geographic regions with
surface temperatures both above and below normal in
different places. An example for the Northern Hemisphere
winter season, December 1993 to February 1994, is shown

Philippines in June 1991 added considerable amounts of
aerosol to the stratosphere which, for about two years,
scattered solar radiation leading to a loss of radiation at the
surface and a cooling there. Human activities contribute to
aerosol particle formation mainly through injection of
sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere (which contributes to
acid rain) particularly from power stations, and through
biomass burning.

"Because human-made aerosols typically remain in the
atmosphere for only a few days they tend to be
concentrated near their sources such as industrial regions.
The radiative forcing therefore possesses a very strong
regional pattern (Chapters 2, 6 and 8), and the presence of
acrosols adds further complexity to possible climate
change as it can help mask, at least temporarily, any global
warming arising from increased greenhouse gases.
However, the aerosol effects do not cancel the global-scale
effects of the much longer-lived greenhouse gases, and
significant climate changes can stil] result.

Several other greenhouse gases are also observed to be
increasing in concentration in the atmosphere because of
human activities (especially biomass burning, landfills, rice
paddies, agriculture, animal husbandry, fossil fuel use and
industry). These include methane, nitrous oxide, and
tropospheric ozone, and they tend to reinforce the changes
in radiative forcing from increased carbon dioxide (Chapter
2). The human-introduced chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) also
produce a greenhouse effect although offset somewhat by
the observed decreases in lower stratospheric ozone since
the 1970s, caused principally by the CFCs and halons
(IPCC, 1994),

Note that if the carbon dioxide were removed from the
atmosphere altogether, the change in outgoing radiation
would be about 30 Wm — 7 or 8 times as big as the change
for doubling — and the magnitude of the temperature change
would be similarly enhanced. The reason is that the carbon
dioxide absorption is saturated over part of the spectral
region where it absorbs, so that the amount of absorption
changes at a much smaller rate than the concentration of the
gas (Chapter 2). If concentrations of carbon dioxide are
more than doubled, then the relationship between radiative
forcing and concentration is such that each further doubling
provides a further radiative forcing of about 4 Wm.

"Human activities also affect the amount of aerosol in the
atmosphere which influences climate in other ways. The
main direct effect of aerosols is the scattering of some solar
radiation back to space, which tends to cool the Earth’s
surface. Some aerosols can also influence the radiation
budget by directly absorbing solar radiation leading to local
heating of the atmosphere and, to a lesser extent, by
absorbing and emitting thermal radiation. A further
influence of aerosols is that many of them act as nuclei on
which cloud droplets condense. A changed concentration
therefore tends to affect the number and size of droplets in
a cloud and hence alters the reflection and the absorption of
solar radiation by the cloud.

"LAL Feedbacks

The increases in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and
changes in aerosol content produce a change in the radiative
forcing (Chapter 2). The determination of the climatic
response to this change in forcing is complicated by
feedbacks. Some of these can amplify the original warming
(positive feedback) while others serve to reduce it (negative
feedback) (Chapter 4). An example of the former is water
vapour feedback in which the amount of water vapour in the
atmosphere increases as the Earth warms and, because
water vapour is an important greenhouse gas, it will amplify
the warming. However, increases in cloud may act either to
amplify the warming through the greenhouse effect of
clouds or reduce it by the increase in albedo (which
measures reflectivity); which effect dominates depends on
the height and type of clouds and varies greatly with
geographic location and time of year. Ice-albedo feedback is
another potentially important process that may lead to
amplification of temperature changes in high latitudes. It
arises because decreases in sea ice, which has high albedo,
decrease the radiation reflected back to space and thus
produces warming which may further decrease the sea ice
extent. However, increased open water may lead to more
atmospheric water vapour and increased fog and low cloud
amount, offsetting the change in surface albedo,

land plays a much smaller role in the storage of heat. A
consequence is that the surface air temperature changes
over land occur much faster and are much larger than over
the oceans for the same heating and, because we live on
land, this directly affects human activities. The land surface
encompasses an enormous variety of topographical features
and soils, differing slopes (which influence runoff and
radiation received) and water capacity. The highly
heterogeneous vegetative cover is a mixture of natural and

Changes in soil moisture affect the disposition of heat and

alter the albedo, roughness, and evapotranspiration. The

The oceans cover 70% of the Earth’s surface and through
their fluid motions, their high heat capacity, and their
ecosystems they play a central role in shaping the Earth’s
climate and its variability. Wind stress at the sea surface
drives the large-scale ocean circulation in its upper layers.
Water vapour, evaporated from the ocean surface, provides
latent heat energy to the atmosphere. The ocean circulation is
an effective means of redistributing heat and fresh water
around the globe. The oceans store heat, absorbed at the
surface, for varying durations and release it in different places
thereby ameliorating temperature changes over nearby land
and contributing substantially to the variability of climate on
many time-scales. Additionally, the ocean thermohaline!
circulation allows water from the surface to be carried into
the deep ocean where it is isolated from atmospheric
influence and hence it may sequester heat for periods of a
thousand years or more. The oceans absorb carbon dioxide
and other gases and exchange them with the atmosphere in
ways that alter with ocean circulation and climate variability.
In addition, it is likely that marine biotic responses to climate
change will result in feedbacks (Chapter 10).

importance is the coupling between the two fluid

climate modelling (Chapter 4). A frontier and future
research challenge is to bring more complete chemistry,

An important and fundamental question concerns the
extent to which the climate is predictable; i.e., are there
climate “signals” large enough to be distinguished from the
“noise” of natural variability that may be potentially
predictable. Reliable weather forecasts can be made using
atmospheric GCMs for periods up to ten days (Chapter 5),
beyond which time detailed predictability is lost because of
the dominance of chaotic dynamics in weather systems.
For some parts of the world, however, some predictability
exists for statistical averages of weather (i.e., the climate)
up to a year or so ahead. Such predictability is largely due
to the influence of the patterns of sea surface temperatures
on the atmosphere. El Nifio events provide the dominant
example. Prediction of changes in sea surface temperatures
in turn requires that climate models be able to adequately
simulate the coupling between ocean and atmosphere.

Changes in climate have occurred in the distant past as
the distribution of continents and their landscapes have
changed, as the so-called Milankovitch changes in the orbit
of the Earth and the Earth’s tilt relative to the ecliptic plane
have varied the insolation received on Earth, and as the
composition of the atmosphere has changed, all through
natural processes. Recent new evidence from ice cores
drilled through the Greenland ice sheet have indicated that
changes in climate may often have been quite rapid and
large, and not associated with any known external forcings.
Understanding the spatial scales of this variability and the
processes and mechanisms involved is very important as it
seems quite possible that strong nonlinearities may be
involved. These may result in large changes from relatively
small perturbations by provoking positively reinforcing
feedback processes in the internal climate system. Changes
in the thermohaline circulation in the Atlantic Ocean are
one way such abrupt changes might be realised (Chapters 4
and 6). An important question therefore is whether there
might be prospects for major surprises as the climate

changes.

can then be assessed by comparing the mean, the annual
cycle and the variability statistics on different time-scales
with observations of the climate. In this way the model is

external forcing can also be predictable, as is evidenced
from several sources. Firstly, there is the mean annual
cycle which climate models simulate very well. Secondly,
there is the existence of the regularities observed in past
climates which were forced by changes in the distribution
of solar radiation arising from the variations in the
geometry of the Sun-Earth orbit. Models show some
success in simulating these past climates. Thirdly, there is
the success of climate models in simulating the changes
due to the effects of stratospheric aerosols from the Mt.

situations, such as changes in solar radiation; the resulting

Predictability is a function of spatial scales. Atmospheric
variability arising from internal instabilities is huge on
small scales; it is mainly the variability on larger scales
influenced by the interactions of the atmosphere with other
parts of the climate system that is predictable. Figure 1.5
shows the natural variability of the annual mean surface
temperature on several different spatial scales from a
climate model simulation for 200 years. The vertical scale
is the same on all three plots, and the standard deviation
goes from 0.1°C for the Southern Hemisphere to 0.5°C for
Australia to 0.8°C for a grid square with sides about 500
km in south-east Australia. This example highlights the
much greater natural variability that can be experienced on
smaller scales which makes detection of the small
systematic signal, such as might arise from enhanced
global mean greenhouse forcing, much more difficult to
achieve on regional scales.

"* Carbon dioxide concentrations have increased by almost
30% from about 280 ppmv in the late 18th century to 358
ppmv in 1994. This increase is primarily due to combustion
of fossil fuel and cement production, and to land-use
change. During the last millennium, a period of relatively
stable climate, concentrations varied by about +10 ppmv
around the pre-industrial value of 280 ppmv. On the
century time-scale these fluctuations were far less rapid
than the change observed over the 20th century.

addressed. There are some unresolved concerns about the
'4C budget which may imply that previous estimates of the
atmosphere-to-ocean flux were slightly too high. However,
the carbon budget remains within our previously quoted
uncertainties and the implications for future projections are
minimal. Suggestions that the observed decay of bomb-!4C

from a mis-understanding of reservoir lifetimes. Current

"** The major components of the anthropogenic
perturbation to the atmospheric carbon budget, with
estimates of their magnitudes over the 1980s, are: (a)
emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement
production (5.5 + 0.5 GtC/yr); (b) atmospheric increase (3.3
+ 0.2 GtC/yr); (c) ocean uptake (2.0 + 0.8 GtC/yr); (d)
tropical land-use changes (1.6 + 1.0 GtC/yr); and (e)
Northern Hemisphere forest regrowth (0.5 + 0.5 GtC/yr).
Other potential terrestrial sinks include enhanced terrestrial
carbon storage due to CO, fertilisation (0.5-2.0 GtC/yr) and
nitrogen deposition (0.2-1.0 GtC/yr), and possibly response
to climatic anomalies. The latter is estimated to be a sink of
0-1.0 GtC/yr over the 1980s, but this term could be either a
sink or a source over other periods. This budget is changed
from IPCC (1994) by a small adjustment (from 3.2 to 3.3
GtC/yr) to the atmospheric rate of increase and a
corresponding decrease in “other terrestrial sinks” from 1.4

Clear evidence has been presented in past IPCC WGI
reports (1990, 1992, 1994) that the atmospheric
concentrations of a number of radiatively active gases have
increased over the past century as a result of human activity.
Most of these trace gases possess strong absorption bands in
the infrared region of the spectrum (where energy is emitted
and absorbed by the Earth’s surface and atmosphere) and
they thus act to increase the heat trapping ability of the
atmosphere and so drive the climate change considered in
this report. The other atmospheric constituents which are
important in climate change are aerosols (suspensions of
particles in the atmosphere) which tend to exert a cooling
effect on the atmosphere.

constituent (see box “Definition of Time-scales”). The past
changes in the concentrations of the stable gases are

The first three sections of this chapter discuss the factors
that affect the atmospheric abundance of carbon dioxide
(Section 2.1), the other trace gases (Section 2.2) and
aerosols (Section 2.3). Section 2.4 discusses the radiative
forcing that arises from changes in the concentrations of
these atmospheric constituents and from changes in solar
output. IPCC (1990) introduced the global warming
potential (GWP) as a measure of possible future
commitments to global warming resulting from current
anthropogenic emissions. The GWP is defined as the
cumulative radiative forcing between the present and some
chosen later time “horizon” caused by a unit mass of gas
emitted now, expressed relative to that of some reference
gas (CO, has typically been used). A GWP is thus not a
simple measure as it involves a number of assumptions
(e.g., the time-scale, the reference gas) and a number of
scientific uncertainties (e.g., lifetime, radiative properties —
discussed in IPCC (1994)). These issues and revised values
of the GWPs of a wide range of gases are presented in
Section 2.5.

"effect on the atmosphere.

The relative importance of the various constituents is
assessed using the concept of radiative forcing. A change
in the concentration of an atmospheric constituent can
cause a radiative forcing by perturbing the balance between
the net incoming radiation and the outgoing terrestrial
radiation. A radiative forcing is defined to be a change in
average net radiation (either solar or terrestrial in origin) at
the top of the troposphere (the tropopause). As defined
here, the incoming solar radiation is not considered a
radiative forcing, although a change in the amount of
incoming solar radiation would be a radiative forcing.
Similarly changes in clouds and water vapour resulting
from alterations to the general circulation of the
atmosphere are considered to be climate feedbacks (see
Chapter 4) rather than radiative forcings. However,
changes caused, for example, in clouds through the indirect
aerosol effect and in water vapour through the oxidation of
methane in the stratosphere, are counted as indirect
radiative forcings. Radiative forcing was discussed in detail
in IPCC (1994): Section 2.4 contains a summary and
update of that material.

"In other situations, where the removal frequency is not constant or there are several reservoirs that exchange with each
other, the equality between T and T, no longer holds. An extreme example is that of CO,. Because of the rapid
exchange of CO, between the atmosphere and the oceans and the terrestrial biota, the turnover time of CO, in the
atmosphere (T) is only about 4 years. However, a large part of the CO, that leaves the atmosphere each year is
returned to the atmosphere from these reservoirs within a few years. Thus, the adjustment time of CO, in the
atmosphere (T,,) is actually determined by the rate of removal of carbon from the surface layer of the oceans into the
deeper layers of the oceans. Although an approximate value of about 100 years may be given for the adjustment time
of CO, in the atmosphere, the actual adjustment is faster in the beginning and slower later on.

many of the key fluxes can fluctuate significantly from year to year (terrestrial sinks and sources: INPE, 1992; Ciais et al., 1995a;
export from the marine biota: Wong et al., 1993). In contrast to the static view conveyed by figures such as this one, the carbon system
is clearly dynamic and coupled to the climate system on seasonal, interannual and decadal time-scales (e.g., Schimel and Sulzman, 1995).

The major components of the atmospheric carbon budget
are anthropogenic emissions, the atmospheric increase,
exchanges between the ocean and the atmosphere, and
exchanges between the terrestrial biosphere and the

decade of the 1980s. In 1990 the emissions were 6.1 +0.6
GtC. The measured average annual rate of atmospheric

The atmospheric CO, concentration records prior to

some values have been inferred indirectly from isotopic

Information between 1000 and 9000 years ago is less
certain because of ice defects. Prior to that, the data show
natural variations, the most noticeable of which is an
increase in CO, level of about 80 ppmv that paralleled the
last interglacial warming. Throughout this record, there is
no direct evidence that past changes in CO, levels were as

suggests that the magnitude of the CO, fertilisation effect
is limited by interactions with nutrients and other
ecological processes. Experimental confirmation from
ecosystem-level studies, however, is lacking. As a result,
the role of the terrestrial biosphere in controlling past
atmospheric CO, concentrations is uncertain, and its
future role is difficult to predict.

The stabilisation analyses explored the relationships
between anthropogenic emissions and atmospheric
concentrations. The analyses were based on a specific set
of concentration profiles constrained to match present-day
(1990) conditions and to achieve stabilisation at different
levels and different future dates. The levels chosen
(350-750 ppmv) spanned a realistic range (which has been,
extended in this report). Stabilisation dates were chosen so
that the emissions changes were not unrealistically rapid.
Precise pathways were somewhat arbitrary, loosely
constrained by the need for smooth and not-too-rapid
emissions changes (see Enting et al. (1994) for detailed
documentation). Alternative pathways are considered in
this report. The models were used to perform a series of
inverse calculations to determine fossil emissions (land-use
emissions were prescribed). These calculations:

For the 18 models used for IPCC (1994), the implied
fossil emissions differed. Initial differences were small,
increasing with time to span a range up to +15% about the
median. In addition, the maximum range of uncertainty in
fossil emissions associated with the parametrization of CO,
fertilisation (evaluated with one of the models) varied
+10% about the median for low stabilisation values and
+15% for higher stabilisation values. For these 1994
calculations, the use of CO, fertilisation alone to control
terrestrial carbon storage, when in fact other ecological
mechanisms are likely to be involved, probably results in
an underestimate of future concentrations (for given
emissions) or an overestimate of emissions (for the
stabilisation profiles). The revised calculations presented
here use a lower fertilisation factor and so the associated
bias is likely to be smaller. IPCC (1994) reported these
results in terms of total anthropogenic emissions, directly
addressing the requirements of the FCCC and
coincidentally removing the loss of generality arising from
choosing a specific land-use flux.

"Moaetting future Concentrations of Atmospheric CO,

For IPCC (1994), modelling groups from many countries
were asked to use published carbon cycle models to
evaluate the degree to which CO, concentrations in the
atmosphere might be expected to change over the next
several centuries, given a standard set of emission
scenarios (including changes in land-use) and levels for
stabilisation of CO, concentrations (350, 450, 550, 650 and
750 ppmv (S350-S750)). Models were constrained to
balance the 1992 IPCC version of the 1980s mean carbon
budget and to match the atmospheric record of past CO,
variations using CO, fertilisation as the sole sink for the
terrestrial biosphere. These analyses were re-done for this
report, using the Bern (Siegenthaler and Joos, 1992; Joos et
al., 1996), Wigley (Wigley, 1993), and Jain (Jain et al.,
1995) models as representatives of the whole model set.
The new calculations incorporated more recent information
about the atmospheric CO, increase and a revised net land-
use flux. As complete data are not yet available for a 1990s
budget, the 1980s mean values were again used as a
reference calibration period to account for the influence of
natural variability. This choice does not affect the results in

any significant way (see Chapter 9).

"The isotopic data and modelling studies suggest that
earlier short-term CO, anomalies on the El Nifio-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) time-scale reflected two opposing
effects: reduced net primary production of the terrestrial
biosphere possibly due to reduced precipitation in monsoon
regions, and a concomitant, temporary increase in oceanic
CO, uptake due to a reduction of the CO, outgassing in the
Pacific equatorial ocean (Keeling et al., 1989b, 1995; Volk,
1989; Siegenthaler, 1990; Winguth et ai., 1994). The most
recent anomaly seems to be unusual as it cannot be directly
related to an ENSO event. Keeling and co-workers suggest
that it may have been induced by a global anomaly in air
temperature. While the evidence for pronounced
interannual variability in both marine and terrestrial
exchange fluxes is strong (Bacastow, 1976; Francey et al.,
1995) the exact magnitude and timing of the variations in
these exchange fluxes remains controversial (Keeling et

"How are these changes explained, and do they matter?
Analyses of the recent changes suggest that both the
relative and absolute magnitudes of ocean and terrestrial
processes vary substantially from year-to-year and that
these changes cause marked annual time-scale changes in
the CO, growth rate. Although the oceanic and biospheric
sources of CO, cannot be distinguished by examining the
concentration data alone, they can be distinguished by
looking at observations of the stable carbon isotope ratio
(3C to °C) of atmospheric CO,. Carbon dioxide release
from the ocean has nearly the same '3C to °C ratio as
atmospheric CO,, whereas carbon of biospheric origin is
substantially depleted in '3C. As such, it is clearly
distinguishable from carbon originating from the ocean.
The use of atmospheric transport modelling to analyse
spatial distributions of CO, and BCo, provides additional
information (Ciais et al., 1995a, b). To study interannual
CO, fluctuations, Keeling et al. (1989a, 1995) removed the

through use of models that simulate the major processes of

carbon cycle model calculations play a central role because
the bulk of projected radiative forcing changes comes from
CO,. In IPCC (1994), two types of carbon cycle
calculations relating future CO, concentration and

"Most of the global carbon cycle models used in IPCC
(1994) (Schimel et al., 1995) address only the longer term
(10 year time-scale) direct perturbation of the global
carbon cycle due to anthropogenic emissions. These
models assume that the physical, chemical, and biological
processes that control the exchange fluxes of carbon
between the different reservoirs change only as a function
of the carbon contents. Hence these models ignore any
perturbations due to fluctuations in climate and are thus not
able to reproduce these shorter-term atmospheric CO,
variations. Nevertheless, some of the more complex
models are founded on physico-chemical and biological
principles that also operate on shorter time-scales and first
attempts to model these interannual variations have been
attempted (Kaduk and Heimann, 1994; Winguth et al.,
1994; Sarmiento et al., 1995). An improved understanding
of the rapid fluctuations of the global carbon cycle would
help to further develop and validate these models and
eventually should help to quantify some of the potential

Fossil fuel burning and cement manufacture, together with
forest harvest and other changes of land-use, all transfer
carbon (mainly as CO,) to the atmosphere. This
anthropogenic carbon then cycles between the atmosphere,

component of the cycling of carbon in the ocean and
terrestrial biosphere occurs slowly, on time-scales of
decades to millennia, the effect of additional fossil and
biomass carbon injected into the atmosphere is a long-
lasting disturbance of the carbon cycle. The record itself

In the 1992 budget the net land-use flux for the
decade of the 1980s was 1.6 GtC/yr and the
atmospheric increase was 3.4 GtC/yr. The more
recent estimate of the net land-use flux, however, is
significantly lower (1.1 GtC/yr).

IPCC (1994) presented a change in atmospheric CO,
over the 1980s of 3.2 GtC/yr, a value that has been
further revised to 3.3 GtC/yr (Komhyr ef al., 1985;
Conway et al., 1994; Tans, pers. comm).

Minor changes have been made to the industrial
emissions data for the 1980s, although these do not
noticeably change the 1980s mean. These changes
mean that the additional sinks required to balance the
budget (which were and still are assigned to the co,
fertilisation effect in the model calculations) are
smaller than assumed in calculations presented in
IPCC (1994), Consequently, when the new budget is
used, future concentration projections for any given
emission scenario are larger relative to those
previously presented, and the emissions consistent
with achieving stabilisation of concentrations are
lower.

modified slightly by the changes in concentration history

available for any given stabilisation level, although they
still do not necessarily span the full option range. It
should be noted that, even though concentration
stabilisation is still possible if emissions initially follow
an existing policies scenario, this cannot be interpreted
as endorsing a policy to delay action to reduce emissions.
Rather, the WRE scenarios were designed to account for
inertia in the global energy system and the potential
difficulty of departing rapidly from the present level of
dependence on fossil fuels. Wigley et al. (1995) stress
the need for a full economic and environmental
assessment in the choice of pathway to stabilisation.
Both the $350-S750 and the WRE350-WRE750 profile
sets require substantial reductions in emissions at some
future time and an eventual emissions level well below
that of today.

The future uptake of CO, by the terrestrial biosphere is
critical to the global carbon balance. In the above
concentration projections and emissions results, the
terrestrial biosphere uptake was determined by the CO,
fertilisation factor, which in turn is determined mainly by the
value assumed for the 1980s mean land-use emissions (if the
ocean uptake is taken as a given). Thus, as in Wigley (1993)
and Enting er al. (1994), we can assess the effects of
fertilisation and future terrestrial uptake uncertainties by
changing the 1980s mean land-use term used in initialising
the carbon cycles models. Because the ocean uptake is held
constant, this results in changing the modelled CO, effect.
The sensitivity of the calculated emissions for CO,
stabilisation at 450 and 650 ppmv to these uncertainties is
shown in Figure 2.7 (cf. Figure 1.16 in Schimel et al., 1995).

the effects of the choice of pathway leading to stabilisation

we show the effect of pathway in more detail by employing
the profiles of Wigley et ai. (1995) (WRE below). Figure
2.5 shows the different pathways, reaching stabilisation at
the same time in each case, for target levels of 450 ppmv to
750 ppmv. The corresponding anthropogenic emissions are
shown in Figure 2.6, which shows two things: first, that the
emissions required to achieve any given stabilisation target
are quite sensitive to the pathway taken to reach that target;
and second, that it is possible to achieve stabilisation even
if the initial emissions pathway follows the IS92a Scenario
for some period of time. There is, of course, a penalty for
this: having higher emissions initially requires a larger and
possibly sharper drop in emissions later, to lower levels
than otherwise (also see Enting, 1995). This is a direct
consequence of the fact that cumulative emissions tend to
become (at the stabilisation point or beyond) similar no
matter what the pathway. If cumulative emissions are
constrained to be nearly constant, then what is gained early
must be lost later.

Atmospheric CO, is taken up by the ocean and the
biospheric carbon pools if a disequilibrium exists between
atmosphere and the ocean (i.e., if the partial pressure of
CO, in the atmosphere is higher than in the surface ocean)
and if the uptake by plant growth is larger than the CO,
released by the biosphere by respiration and by decay of
organic carbon (heterotrophic respiration). For terrestrial
ecosystems, the removal of radiocarbon and that of
anthropogenic CO, from the atmosphere are different.
Carbon storage corresponds to the difference in net primary
production (plant growth, NPP) and decay of organic
carbon plus plant respiration. Radiocarbon, however, is
assimilated in proportion to the product of NPP and the
atmospheric !4C/!?C ratio, and is released in proportion to
the decay rate of organic matter and its '4C/!*C ratio.

Some recently published work (Starr, 1993) has argued that
the post-industrial increase of atmospheric CO, may be due
largely to natural variation rather than to human causes.
This argument hinges on a presumed low value for the
“lifetime” of CO, in the atmosphere. The argument is as
follows: if the atmospheric lifetime were short, then large
net CO, fluxes into the atmosphere would have been
required to produce the observed concentration increases;
if it were long, smaller fluxes would yield the observed
increases. Proponents of a natural cause assert that the CO,
lifetime is (and has remained) only a decade or less. The
“evidence” for such a short lifetime includes the rapid
decline of bomb '4C in the atmosphere following its 1964
peak. A lifetime this short would require fluxes much
larger than those estimated from fossil fuel burning in
order to produce the observed atmospheric increase;
therefore, the reasoning goes, the build-up can only be
partly human-induced.

Because of the different dynamic behaviour, '4C can not
be taken as a simple analogue tracer for the excess
anthropogenic CO,, a fact that has long been known to the
carbon cycle modelling community (e.g., Revelle and

Thus a !4C perturbation, such as the bomb !4C input into
the atmosphere, induces a net transfer of !4C into oceans
and biosphere. Because the 4co, molecules generated
from the bomb tests represent a negligible CO, excess and,
more importantly, because the atmospheric 4C/!C ratio is
changed considerably by the #C input, this results in a
large isotopic disequilibrium between the atmosphere and
the oceanic and terrestrial biospheric reservoirs.

Changes in the concentration of a number of gases
(methane, nitrous oxide, the halocarbons and ozone) have
resulted in a combined radiative forcing which is similar in
magnitude to that of CO, since pre-industrial times. ‘Their
concentrations in the atmosphere depend on chemical
processes, which regulate their removal rates (methane,
nitrous oxide, halocarbons) and sometimes their production
as well (ozone). The chemistry of the atmosphere is

global carbon cycle, requiring a smaller role for the oceans,

This imbalance may be explained either by a hidden high
(above 30 km height) stratospheric bomb !4C inventory not
detected in the existing observations, which is unlikely, or
by an overestimated bomb radiocarbon inventory in the
terrestrial biosphere or the ocean or both. The calculated
biospheric reservoir uptake would have to be reduced by
about 80% in order to achieve the global bomb radiocarbon
balance. Such a reduction is very unlikely, as it strongly
contradicts observations of bomb '4C in wood (e.g., in tree
rings: Levin et al., 1985) and soils (Harrison et al., 1993), A
more likely, albeit tentative, explanation is that previous
estimates of the oceanic bomb 4C inventory compiled from
the observations of the GEOSECS program (1973-78)
(Broecker ef al., 1985) are too high by approximately 25%.
This is slightly larger than the generally accepted uncertainty
of this quantity. Because this explanation is inconsistent with
a new assessment of the oceanic observations (Broecker et
al., 1995) the issue is still not fully resolved.

Our ability to model ‘tropospheric ozone is not restricted
solely by the limitations of our chemistry/transport models.
Equally important is our lack of quantitative knowledge of
the global sources and distribution of tropospheric ozone
and its short-lived precursors (active nitrogen oxides
(NO,), hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide). For example,
even the relative importance of the anthropogenic NO,
sources (transport of surface pollution out of the boundary
layer, direct injection by aircraft) and natural sources
(lightning, soils, stratospheric input) is not well known.
Again, no major advances have been made in this field
since IPCC (1994).

"There has been considerable speculation and modelling
of the possible cause(s) of the 1992/93 anomaly. From
methane isotope data, i.e., the relative abundance of BCH,
to °-CH,, Lowe ef al. (1994) suggest that decreased
emissions of fossil fuels in the Northern Hemisphere
(Dlugokencky et al., 1994c) and decreased biomass
burning in the tropics may have played significant roles.
Schauffler and Daniel (1994) suggest that enhanced
tropospheric-stratospheric exchange, caused by the
additional stratospheric heating by the Mt. Pinatubo
aerosol, could have been a contributory factor in 1992.
Bekki et al. (1994) propose a mechanism related to Mt.
Pinatubo, whereby significantly reduced stratospheric
ozone levels following the eruption caused enhanced levels
of UV to reach the troposphere (a known effect) and
resulted in increased tropospheric hydroxy! radical (OH)
levels and increased methane destruction (a model result).
Hogan and Harriss (1994) have suggested that temperature
effects on natural wetlands are a possible contributing
cause, Many of these factors contributed to the observed
methane anomaly in 1992/93, but at present it is not clear
what their relative contributions are, whether they can fully
explain the observed anomalies in concentration and
isotopic composition, or even whether we have identified
all of the important processes.

7%/yr in the Northern Hemisphere (Irion et al., 1994;

show rapidly accelerating growth rates since 1993. In the
remote Southern Hemisphere (Cape Grim, Tasmania),
HCFC-142b increased from 0.2 pptv in 1978 to 3 pptv in
1993; and HCFC-141b, from 0.1 pptv in 1982 to 0.5 pptv in
1993 (Figure 2.11). These NOAA—-CMDL data for 1994
give a mean concentration and growth rate of about 0.6
pptv/yr (21%/yr) for HCFC-142b, and 2 pptv/yr (67%/yr)
for HCFC-141b. Analyses of both data sets indicate that
industry estimates of emissions (AFEAS, 1995) may be low.

There is observational evidence that tropospheric ozone
(about 10% of the total-column ozone) has increased in the
Northern Hemisphere (north of 20°N) over the past three
decades (Logan, 1994; Harris er al., 1995). The available
measurements have been made primarily in industrialised
countries so their geographic coverage is limited. Even so
the trends are highly regional. They are smaller in the
1980s than in the 1970s and are negative at some locations
(Tarasick et al., 1995). European measurements at surface
sites also indicate a doubling in the lower-tropospheric
ozone concentrations since earlier this century. At the
South Pole, a decrease has been observed since the mid-
1980s. Elsewhere in the Southern Hemisphere, there are
insufficient data to draw strong inferences. IPCC (1994)
estimated that tropospheric ozone in the Northern
Hemisphere has doubled, from 25 to 50 ppbv, since the
pre-industrial. There is no new information to change or
strengthen this tentative conclusion. The tropospheric
ozone budget is discussed in Section 2.3.3.2.

Downward trends i in total- column ozone continue to be
observed over much of the globe. Decreases in ozone
abundances of about 4~5% per decade at mid-latitudes in
the Northern and Southern Hemispheres are observed by
both ground-based and satellite-borne monitoring
instruments. At mid-latitudes, the losses continue to be
larger during winter/spring than during summer/fall in both
hemispheres, and the depletion increases with latitude,
particularly in the Southern Hemisphere. Little or no
downward trends are observed in the tropics (20°N-20°S).
While the current two-dimensional stratospheric models
simulate the observed trends quite well during some
seasons and latitudes, they underestimate the trends by
factors of 1.5 to 3 in winter/spring at mid- and high
latitudes. Several known atmospheric processes involving
chlorine and bromine that affect ozone in the lower
stratosphere are difficult to simulate numerically and have
not been adequately incorporated into these models. A
comprehensive review of issues pertaining to atmospheric
ozone was recently completed (WMO/UNEP, 1995).

Stratospheric water vapour is a direct greenhouse gas
(IPCC, 1990) as well as a critical chemical component of
ozone chemistry (indirect effect). It is expected to increase
as a result of increasing CH, abundances and also possibly
from increases in tropopause temperatures that allow more
water vapour to enter the stratosphere. Stratospheric water
vapour measurements made over Boulder, Colorado
(40°N) from 1981 to 1994 show increases that are
statistically significant at some altitudes in the lower
stratosphere (Oltmans and Hofmann, 1995). These
increases are only partly explained by the concurrent
increases in methane and may point to other long-term
trends in the stratosphere. However, these results at a
single site do not necessarily point to a global trend (see,
for example, the different geographic trends in total ozone,

Carbon monoxide (CO), not itself an important greenhouse
gas, is an important component of the oxidising capacity of
the troposphere. It is short-lived, responds rapidly to
changes in sources or its sink, the OH radical, and
contributes to formation of tropospheric ozone.
Intercomparison of CO standards at atmospheric levels
from three laboratories (NOAA-CMDL, NASA-Langley
and Fraunhofer-Institut) indicate general agreement to
within 2% (Novelli et al., 1994a) and allow us to combine
the different observational records. The recently reported
global trend of —6 to —8%/yr since 1990 (IPCC 1994;
Novelli et al, 1994b) has been observed in another global
observational network but at a smaller rate of —2 to
—3%/yr (Khalil and Rasmussen, 1994), At Mace Head,
Ireland, however, small increases in CO (0.6%/yr) for 1990
to 1992 have been reported for pollution-free samples
while decreases (— 13%/yr) are found for air masses that
originated over Europe (Derwent et al., 1994). These

"Notes: This table lists only the direct radiative forcing from emitted gases. The indirect effects due to subsequent changes in
atmospheric chemistry, notably ozone (see below), are not included. The Wm-* column refers to the radiative forcing since the pre-
industrial, and the Wm7?/ppbv column is accurate only for small changes about the current atmospheric composition (see Section 2.4
and IPCC (1994)). In particular, CO,, CH, and N,O concentration changes since pre-industrial times are too large to assume linearity;
the formulae reported in IPCC(1990) are used to evaluate their total contribution.

A blank entry indicates that a value is not available, Uncertainties for many lifetimes have not been evaluated, The concentrations of
some anthropogenic gases are small and difficult to measure. The pre-industrial concentrations of some gases with natural sources are
difficult to determine. Radiative forcings are only given for those gases with values greater than 0.001 Wm,

@Methane increases are calculated to cause increases in tropospheric ozone and stratospheric HO; these indirect effects, about 25% of
the direct effect, are not included in the radiative forcings given here.

$ The direct radiative forcing due to changes in the CO concentration is unlikely to reach a few hundredths of a Wm (see Section
2.4.1). The direct radiative forcing is hard to quantify (see Section 2.2.4).

** Gases with rapidly changing growth rates over the past decade, recent trends since 1992 are reported.

# The change in CHCl, concentration is due to the recalibration of the absolite standards used to measure this gas (see Section 2.2.3).
Stratospheric ozone depletion due to halocarbons is about —2 % (globally) over the period 1979 to 1990 with half as much again
occurring both immediately before and since; the total radiative forcing is thus now about —0.1 Wm. Tropospheric ozone appears to
have increased since the 19th Century over the northern mid-latitudes where few observational records are available; if over the entire
Northern Hemisphere, tropospheric ozone increased from 25 ppb to 50 ppb at present, then the radiative forcing is about +0.4 Wm.

One already mentioned is that increases in atmospheric
CH, concentrations, however small, will reduce the
tropospheric concentrations of the hydroxyl radical, which
in turn will increase the lifetime of CH, in the troposphere,
and amplify the original perturbation in the CH,
concentration (Prather, 1994). That feedback expresses
itself in an adjustment time that is larger than the CH,
turnover time. The ratio of adjustment time to turnover
time depends on the exact formulation of the chemistry and
varies between models. Table 2.4 presents such ratios
along with the CH, global mean lifetimes (i.e., turnover)
obtained from various models. The ratio, also called
feedback factor in IPCC (1994), varies between 1.2 and 1.7
and is not correlated with the CH, lifetimes obtained by the
models, which vary from 8.7 to 13.2 years. This suggests
that the feedback factor does not depend on the CH,
turnover time. Thus there is no reason to revise the ratio of
adjustment time to turnover time used in IPCC (1994).

Tropospheric ozone is one of the more reactive, radiatively
active trace gases whose distribution is controlled by a
complex interplay of chemical, radiative and dynamical
processes. Ozone is transported down into the troposphere
from the stratosphere at mid- and high latitudes, destroyed
at the Earth’s surface, produced by the photo-oxidation of
CO, methane and other hydrocarbons in the presence of
NO, (NO, and NO), and destroyed by ultraviolet
photolysis and reaction with HO, (HO, and OH) radicals.
The interplay between these processes results in local
tropospheric turnover times for ozone varying from days to
weeks. Hence, its concentration varies with latitude,
longitude, altitude, season and time of day.

"Most of the oxidation of long-lived radiatively active
gases such as CH,, CH,Cl, CH3Br, CH,CC1, and HCFCs
takes place in the tropics, where high UV and humidity
promote the formation of OH from photolysis of ozone
(Prather and Spivakovsky, 1990; Thompson, 1992). Ozone
in the tropical troposphere thus plays a critical role in
controlling the oxidising power of the atmosphere. An
analysis of aircraft observations over the tropical South
Atlantic (Jacob et al., 1993b) indicates a close balance in
the tropospheric column between photochemical
production and loss of ozone, with net production in the
upper troposphere balancing net loss in the lower
troposphere. The production of ozone is driven by NO,
originating from continental sources (biomass burning,
lightning, soils). Transport from the stratosphere is
negligible as a source of tropospheric ozone or NO, in this
particular region. By extrapolation, Jacob ef al. (1993b)
proposed a general mechanism for the origin of ozone in
the tropical troposphere: convection over the continents
injects NO, to high altitudes, leading to net ozone
production in the upper troposphere; eventually the ozone
subsides over the oceans and net loss takes place in the
lower troposphere, closing the ozone cycle. The proposed
mechanism implies a great sensitivity of the oxidising
power of the atmosphere to the NO, emissions from
tropical continents. Unfortunately there has been no real
increase either in our confidence in numerical simulations
of global tropospheric ozone or in the measurements of
ozone, particularly in the tropics and the Southern
Hemisphere, needed to test the simulations.

The climatic impact of aircraft, due to emissions of
particles, water vapour and NO,, remains a serious concern
in research and assessment (e.g., Graedel, 1994; Schumann
and Wurzel, 1994; Stolarski and Wesoky, 1995). The
potential impact of a supersonic fleet operating in the
stratosphere has been studied and reviewed extensively.
Stratospheric ozone depletion (a negative radiative forcing)
due to emission of NO, is currently predicted to be small,
less than 1%, provided a new generation of engines with
NO, emission indices of 3 to 8g (NO,) per kg of fuel can
be built (Wahner et al., 1995).

"The photolysis of ozone and its reactions with HO,
radicals, in addition to controlling the ozone lifetime and
budget, are important components of the fast
photochemical balance of the sunlit troposphere. This
balance establishes a small steady state concentration of the
highly reactive hydroxyl (OH) radical which control the
removal of most trace gases including methane, carbon
monoxide, NO, and a wide range of organic compounds.
The global tropospheric concentration of hydroxyl radicals
thus determines the oxidising capacity of the troposphere,
the build-up of radiatively active gases and the flux of
some ozone- depleting halocarbons to the stratosphere.

We adopt turnover and adjustment times for the
greenhouse gases as described in IPCC (1994) and updated
in Table 2.2. For CHy, the chemical feedback of its
concentration on its own lifetime has been included as a
sensitivity factor: the atmospheric loss rate (i.e., not
including soil loss) decreases by 0.30% for every 1%
increase in the methane concentration above 1700 ppbv.
Thus as CH, increases from 1700 to 4100 ppbv, the global
turnover time (including soil loss) increases from 8.6 to
11.0 yr. Since the IS92 emissions for CH, and N,O are
inconsistent with observations and these lifetimes, they
were adjusted so that the concentrations in the 1990s
matched the observations. This constant offset from the
original IS92 scenarios is effectively a redefinition of the
natural, baseline emissions. No attempt has been made to
adjust the IS92 scenarios to match the 1992/93 anomaly.

There is increasing observational “evidence that we
understand and are able to measure and model local
concentrations of OH (e.g., Poppe et al., 1994; Wennberg
et al., 1994; Miiller et al., 1995). However, our knowledge
of the global OH distribution is still limited by our ability
to model accurately the large range of conditions that
determine the OH concentration (e.g., O;, NO,,
hydrocarbons, cloud cover). The global and hemispheric
mean value of OH can be derived from analyses of
observations of methyl chloroform and !4CO. Analysis of
atmospheric '4CO data has been used to argue for an
asymmetry in the mean tropospheric OH between
hemispheres, with about 20% more !4CO (and hence 20%
Jess average OH) in the Northern Hemisphere (Mak et al.,
1994). Similar results come from the 12-box atmospheric
model fitting of methyl chloroform (Prinn et al., 1995b),
but some 3-D models fit the observed CH;CCI, without
significant asymmetry in OH. More evidence is needed to
be certain of any hemispheric asymmetry in tropospheric
OH. The low uncertainty in OH levels (412%) is limited,
however, to globally integrated quantities. Confidence in
the seasonality is limited.

Aerosols influence climate in two ways, directly through
scattering and absorbing radiation and indirectly through
modifying the optical properties and lifetime of clouds.
IPCC (1994) concluded that uncertainties in the
estimation of direct aerosol forcing arose from the limited
information on the spatial and temporal distribution of
aerosol particles as well as of the optical properties of the
particles themselves. While a body of observations of
sulphate aerosol was available, there were only limited
data on a global scale for other aerosol] components.
Furthermore, the sensitivity of the optical properties to
the size distribution of the particles, as well as to their
chemical composition, made it difficult to relate the
aerosol forcing to emissions in a simple manner. Model
distributions based on the present sources and sinks along
with empirically determined optical properties have been
used to estimate direct forcing although it is recognised
that changes in the sources, even if total emissions are
conserved, are likely to give a different magnitude as well
as geographical distribution of the forcing. Similarly,

"Ue PCL U7) analysis of the deita-Ch, simuiations,

A major simplification of the IS92 scenarios is that we
have chosen to ignore the changing emissions of the short-
lived gases: CO, VOC (volatile organic compounds) and
NO,. Although we would like to include a complete
atmospheric simulation with changing emissions of the
major greenhouse gases and also these short-lived gases,
there are two compelling reasons why this cannot be done at
this time. First, there is not a strong enough consensus on
how to treat the short-lived gases in the currently available
coarse resolution global models, and on how the chemical
feedbacks couple these highly reactive species with CH,.
Second, the impact of these short-lived species depends
critically on where and when these gases are emitted. For
example, the IS92 scenarios do not differentiate between
aircraft, urban combustion and diffuse agricultural NO,
emissions. The yield of ozone (a greenhouse gas) per
emitted NO, molecule depends critically on these local
conditions (e.g., Chameides et al., 1994; Schumann and
Wurzel, 1994; Derwent, 1996). Thus until we have a
consensus on the tropospheric chemistry models and until
the scenarios for short-lived gases include spatially resolved
emissions (and speciated in the case of VOC), the IS92
calculations cannot include these short-lived gases. This
decision is not a recommendation to use the extremely
simplified representation of atmospheric chemistry in
integrated models (e.g., Prather, 1988; Wigley, 1995).

In the context of indirect forcing, recent work has
suggested a possible role for organic particles as CCN.
Furthermore, recent field measurements have provided
further data on the relationships between aerosol particles

Most estimates of the radiative forcing due to
anthropogenic sulphate aerosols have been based on the
sulphate distributions calculated by Langner and Rodhe
(1991) using the MPI-Mainz MOGUNTIA model. In order
to illustrate the sensitivity of the result to assumptions
about the rate of oxidation of sulphur dioxide (SO) to
sulphate in clouds, one of the key processes in the sulphur
cycle, Langner and Rodhe (1991) made two separate
simulations. One simulation was based on immediate
oxidation of SO, as soon as it encounters cloud, the other
assumed a delayed rate of oxidation corresponding to some
degree of oxidant limitation. The former case, referred to
by the authors as the “standard” case (it might also have

The simplest way to estimate the average concentration
of aerosol particles is to apply a box model in which the
global rate of emission is multiplied by an average turnover
time, estimated from the efficiency of the removal
processes, to yield a global burden. Such first-order
estimates have been made for anthropogenic sulphate
(Charlson et al., 1990; Charlson er al., 1992) and soot
(Penner, 1995). Radiative forcings estimated from the
aerosol loadings predicted using such models tend to be
overestimates, compared with those based on more detailed
models, partly because box models neglect the spatial
correlation that exists between aerosol concentration and
cloudiness since large industrial emissions are in relatively
cloudy regions. Forcing estimates which include explicit
consideration of the spatial variability of the aerosol
distribution, cloudiness and solar radiation have to be
based on three-dimensional models of the global aerosol
distribution. Such models have been developed for acrosol
sulphate (Langner and Rodhe, 1991; Taylor and Penner,
1994; Feichter et al., 1996; Pham et al., 1995), for soot
(Penner et al., 1993; Cooke and Wilson, 1996), and for
mineral dust (Tegen and Fung, 1994).

"regions (Jonas et al., 1995). In contrast to the
predominantly scattering effect of sulphate aerosol,
carbonaceous aerosol absorbs solar radiation. While the
uncertainty regarding the direct radiative forcing of
sulphates has been narrowed somewhat (Section 2.4),
increased recognition has been given to the role of
carbonaceous aerosols, both organic compounds and soot.
Neither the sources nor the ambient-air properties of these
carbon-containing aerosols have been adequately
characterised. As a result, the relative uncertainties in the
calculated radiative forcing by carbonaceous aerosols are
even larger than for the sulphates. In addition, sampling,
measurement and chemical analysis methods for
carbonaceous aerosols have not been standardised, and
molecular characterisation is difficult and seldom
attempted. Thus much of the present data set on
carbonaceous aerosols must be viewed as not being truly
appropriate for calculation of direct radiative forcing.
Further, the lack of molecular information and the
simultaneous lack of detailed information on water
solubility and surface chemical properties make it difficult
to address properly the role of carbonaceous particles as
CCN. Nonetheless, some progress has been made towards
bounding the direct forcing by both soot and organic
aerosols, while empirical evidence has emerged that
implicates organic aerosol particles in the process of cloud
droplet formation (Novakov and Penner, 1993).

size distribution of the aerosol was measured, in most
experiments only the total aerosol mass was measured. For
the case of organic aerosol particles, the suggested size
distribution is similar to that of sulphates (with the mass
mainly in the 0.1 - 1.0 4m diameter range) so that there
should be reasonable similarity between the scattering
efficiencies of organic and sulphate aerosol (Penner et al.,
1992), However, since the data on soot emissions have not
been acquired with any standardisation of sampling or
analysis techniques, the emission factors must be regarded
as preliminary estimates. Many of the soot emission data
have been obtained from studies relating to inhalation and
human health effects and these studies involve sampling of
particles up to about 10 wm in diameter. As can be seen
from Figure 2.14, the absorption efficiency of spherical
soot particles is calculated to be a strong function of
particle size, with little absorption occurring for particles
larger than about 1 pm equivalent diameter. The
dependence of absorption by non-spherical particles on
their equivalent aerodynamic diameter is not well known.
This, together with the fact that the atmospheric residence
time of particles larger than 1 p.m is much shorter than that
for small particles, suggests that the use of existing
emission data is uncertain and likely to overestimate both
particle mass concentration and light absorption. Specific
size-resolved sampling is needed to delineate the amount of
soot emitted as particles smaller than 1 jm; in the absence
of optical characterisation of soot from different sources,
the existing data should be regarded more as upper limits
on soot emissions than as current best estimates.

Observations of cloud properties by Alkezweeny et al.
(1993) demonstrate the impact of anthropogenic aerosol
particles on cloud optical properties, Recent field
experiments off the coast of California (MAST, the
Monterey Area Ship Track experiment) and in the Arctic
have provided further evidence for the impact of aerosol
particles. Preliminary analyses of these experiments, and
other studies (e.g., Hindman and Bodowski, 1994;
Hindman et al., 1995), have largely confirmed the impact
of non-absorbing aerosol particles in increasing the albedo
of clouds through their effect on the droplet concentration.
The results emphasise that the sensitivity of clouds to
aerosol particles is highly variable and is reduced in
regions of high natural aerosol loading. There remain,
however, some systematic differences between calculated
and observed values of infrared albedo which may be due
to the inhomogeneous nature of the cloud layers (Hayasaka
et al., 1994), Whether such inhomogeneities affect the
sensitivity of cloud optical properties to droplet
concentration has not been determined: there is some
evidence that the optical properties of inhomogencously
mixed clouds are less sensitive to droplet concentration
than more uniform clouds (Novakov et al., 1994).

The reduction in stratospheric chlorine and bromine
loading which will result from the Montreal Protocol and
its Amendments is expected to lead to a recovery of the
stratospheric ozone layer over the next century
(WMO/UNEP, 1995). During the 1980s the ozone loss
partially offsets the forcing due to the well-mixed
greenhouse gases, but in the early decades of the next
century the ozone recovery constitutes a positive radiative
forcing that acts to enhance the effect of the well-mixed
greenhouse gases. Solomon and Daniel (1996) have
estimated the consequences of the recovery on radiative

The transition from ozone loss to ozone recovery changes

about 0.59 Wm-*/decade for the period 2000 to 2009. If the

Depletion of stratospheric ozone can affect the
distributions of other radiatively active species (see Section
2.2). Thus, the net radiative forcing due to ozone-depleting
gases such as CFCs and halons depends not only upon the
induced ozone depletion but also upon the subsequent
chemical changes that can follow from stratospheric ozone
depletion. Most notable among these is the dominant role
of stratospheric ozone in controlling the transmission of the
ultraviolet radiation to the troposphere and, in turn, the

In spite of large uncertainties, the two studies taken
together suggest that the total radiative forcing due to
ozone depletion including indirect chemical effects relating
to tropospheric OH is likely to exceed that obtained from
the ozone depletion alone, perhaps by a factor of two or
more. Any radiative forcing associated with methane
changes will already be implicitly accounted for in the
estimates of the forcing due to changes in the well-mixed
greenhouse gases. The forcing resulting from changes in
cloud properties would be in addition to the radiative
forcing of -0.1 Wm™ (with a factor of two uncertainty)
due to stratospheric ozone change proposed in IPCC
(1994). However, given the uncertainties in characterising
the ozone-induced effect on clouds, we believe it to be too

Madronich and Granier (1992) emphasised that through
this mechanism ozone depletion could play a role in
determining methane trends. The modelling study of Bekki
et al. (1994) provides support for this mechanism by
examining the role of enhanced ozone depletion following
the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo upon the reduced methane
growth rates observed at that time. However, other
processes may also have affected the observed methane
response as noted in Section 2.2. Bekki et al. (1994) also
emphasised that the observed global ozone depletion of
about 3% would be expected to produce an indirect
negative radiative forcing due to methane decreases and
associated tropospheric ozone decreases that is about
30-50% of the forcing due to the ozone depletion alone.
Thus this study suggests a total radiative forcing associated
with ozone depletion that could be 30-50% more negative
than estimates of this forcing that neglect the impact of
ultraviolet transmission changes upon methane and
tropospheric ozone. Because the bulk of methane
destruction normally takes place in tropical latitudes while
ozone depletion maximises in mid- and high latitudes, the
details of such estimates are dependent on the uncertainties
in the latitudinal distribution of ozone depletion, as well as

tropospheric transport characteristics.

It should also be recognised that aerosol forcing
estimates tend to be “partial derivatives”: i.e., the forcing
that would result from that aerosol component alone.
Because of interactions between different aerosol
components, the radiative properties of multi-component
aerosols are not necessarily the same as the sum of the
individual components (as will be discussed for soot
aerosols in Section 2.4.2.2); the same consideration applies
to the effect of aerosols on cloud properties.

There is a large uncertainty range particularly for the
radiative forcing due to the effect of aerosols on cloud
properties. As also emphasised in IPCC (1994), the aerosol
radiative forcing is spatially very inhomogeneous so that a
direct comparison of the global mean forcing with the
forcing due to other mechanisms might not give a complete
picture. Nevertheless, the global mean value remains a
useful single-parameter method of comparing different
aerosol forcing estimates.

A number of authors have reported a long-term decline
in solar radiation reaching the surface at some locations
using routine observations of global solar radiation since
the 1950s (e.g., Liepert er al., 1994; Stanhill and Moreshet,
1994; Li et al., 1995). There are several potential factors
that could cause such a change. These include the increased
scattering from aerosols and changes in water vapour and
cloud amounts. Thus the decline may be a direct indication
of aerosol forcing but it may also be an indication of water
vapour and/or cloud feedbacks as a consequence of recent
climate change. Such observations may, nevertheless,

that the effect of changing size and composition of aerosols

for the different effects to compensate. Kiehl and Briegleb

Much of the work on aerosol radiative forcing to date has
concentrated on the role of sulphate aerosols. However,
soot aerosols absorb radiation at solar wavelengths, so
increases in the amount of soot may result in a positive
radiative forcing. The quantitative understanding of the
effects of soot on radiative forcing is still poor. Size-
segregated climatologies of the distribution of soot are not
currently available (see Section 2.3.2). Uncertainties in the

sulphates, and the manner of the mixing has a significant
bearing on the optical characteristics of the composite
aerosol. Conceptual models of aerosol mixtures have been
proposed, ranging from external mixtures (where the
sulphate and soot aerosols are separate entities) to internal
mixtures (e.g., concentric spheres with soot as the core or
the shell of an aerosol (Ackerman and Toon, 1981)). In
general, calculations demonstrate that when an absorber is
internally mixed with a scattering particle the degree of
absorption by the composite particle can be enhanced
considerably (e.g., Heintzenberg, 1978; Ackerman and
Toon, 1981). Thus, the quantitative aspects concerning the
amount of radiation scattered and absorbed, besides being
governed by the amount of the absorbing substance, also
depend on the nature of the mixture and the optical mixing
rules. Soot particles are often non-spherical, further adding
to the uncertainty in their radiative properties (Chylek et
al., 1981), A recent theoretical development (Chylek ef al.,
1995) has focused on developing general solutions for the
radiative effect of soot present in sulphate aerosols; this

this decrease on cloud liquid water content and possibly
cloud cover. The difficulties in quantifying the indirect
effect of aerosols were stressed (see also the review by
Schwartz and Slingo (1996)). As discussed in Section

relating sulphate aerosol loading to cloud droplet number
concentration. The sulphate aerosol distribution is derived
using the MOGUNTIA model, as used by Langner and

range of different assumptions was made on the sulphate
cloud droplet number concentration relationship: the global
mean results fell in the range —0.5 to —1.5 Wm, with a
Northern Hemisphere — Southern Hemisphere ratio of
between 2 and 4; the smaller ratios are from the ECHAM

Much work needs to o be done to explore the validity of
the assumptions made in this study and to extend it to
cloudy regions. There are two distinct ways that clouds
affect the soot forcing. First, soot placed above clouds with
high albedos is able to cause a greater positive forcing than
the same amount of soot over a low albedo surface.
Second, if soot exists as an internal mixture with cloud
liquid water, this could enhance the absorption
considerably (see e.g., Danielson et al., 1969; Chylek et al.,
1984; Chylek and Hallett, 1992). Sulphate aerosols lead to
less solar radiation being absorbed by the Earth/atmosphere
system as a whole and by the surface; soot aerosols
increase the absorption by the system but decrease that
reaching the surface. Therefore, the overall climate effect
may differ from that with sulphate aerosols. It is clear that
components of aerosol other than sulphate (including
organics and soot) need to be considered if the total effects
of aerosols are to be established.

cleaner clouds there are more susceptible to changes in
aerosol amounts. The method also assumes the
interhemispheric differences are solely related to human
activity. Boucher’s values can be interpreted as the
difference in anthropogenic forcing between the
hemispheres. An estimate of the global mean forcing can
then be made by applying the ratio of the forcing between
the two hemispheres derived in the GCM studies and by
assuming that Boucher’s value for 0 to 50°N is

over this time period; Figure 2.15 shows estimates of this variation. Note that there are substantial differences in the geographical
distribution of the forcing due to the well-mixed greenhouse gases (CO,, N,O, CH, and the halocarbons) and that due to ozone and
aerosols, which could lead to significant differences in their respective global and regional climate responses (see Chapter 6). For this
reason, the negative radiative forcing due to aerosols should not necessarily be regarded as an offset against the greenhouse gas forcing.

It was 5 noted i in IPCC (1994) that changes in surface

because of the problems discussed in IPCC (1994), it is
still not possible to produce a reliable quantification of the

further studies of the effect of aerosols on cloud properties
(the indirect effect) the estimated range of 0 to —1.5 Wm?

The estimate for the forcing due to changes in solar
output since 1850 remains unchanged from the IPCC
(1994) value of +0.1 to +0.5 Wm-*. The available
evidence indicates that natural variations in the radiative
forcing, due to volcanic eruptions and changes in solar
output, may have been important in determining some of
the decadal scale variations in global climate over the past
150 years. Nevertheless, the cumulative radiative forcing
due to human activity remains large compared to these and,
on this evidence, this radiative forcing would be expected
to have played a more significant role in determining the
long-term trends in climate over the past 150 years.

"Figure 2, 16 shows our best estimates of the global mean
radiative forcing due to a number of mechanisms since pre-
industrial times. As was emphasised in IPCC (1994), the
global mean forcing must be used with caution. In
particular, the offset between positive and negative
contributions to the global mean forcing does not take into
account the fact that the regional distributions of the
radiative forcing due, for example, to greenhouse gases and
sulphate aerosols, are quite different. Thus even if, by
coincidence, the global mean forcing were to be zero, due to
a fortuitous cancellation between global mean forcings of
opposite signs, this must not be taken to imply the absence
of regional or possibly ¢ even en global scale climate change.

It was also stressed in Section 4.7.1 of IPCC (1994) that
different forcing mechanisms have different levels of
confidence associated with them. The forcing due to the
well-mixed greenhouse gases (CO,, CH,, N,O and the
CFCs) have the highest confidence, as they are based on
well-characterised observations of the changes in gas
concentration since pre-industrial times. On the other hand,
estimates of the changes in concentrations of tropospheric
ozone and tropospheric aerosols rely largely on model
estimates which still have significant uncertainties. In
Figure 2.16 the error bar indicates an estimate of the
uncertainty range, based largely on the spread in the
available literature; our subjective confidence that the
actual forcing lies within this error bar is indicated by the

Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons effectively absorb
infrared radiation, thereby contributing to the positive
radiative forcing induced by greenhouse gases. However,
their role in depleting stratospheric ozone also leads to a
negative radiative forcing, particularly for ozone losses
near the tropopause (Lacis et al., 1990; Ramaswamy et al.,
1992). Ramaswamy ef al. (1992) concluded that the
globally averaged decrease in radiative forcing due to
stratospheric ozone depletion including both infrared and
solar effects represents an indirect effect that
approximately balanced the globally averaged increase in
direct radiative forcing due to halocarbons during the
decade of the 1980s. Therefore, the net GWPs for ozone-

Insofar as significant ozone loss likely occurs only for
stratospheric active chlorine levels above a certain
threshold, the total negative radiative forcing caused by
any halocarbon depends upon the abundances of others and
cannot be specified independent of past abundances and
future scenarios (see Daniel et al., 1995). This implies that
GWPs for halocarbons based upon the indirect effects
estimated for injection of an infinitesimally smal! amount
of added gas cannot be used to calculate directly the total
radiative impact of the true amount of that gas in the
Earth’s atmosphere; this limitation is similar to that for
methane discussed in IPCC (1994). Further, the net GWPs
for ozone depletors refer to an explicit period from a
chosen start date (e.g., the present) to the end of the time
horizon.

Daniel et al. (1995) considered the following
uncertainties in deriving the net GWPs for halocarbons: (i)
likely variations in the scenario for future concentrations of
ozone-depleting gases (from WMO/UNEP, 1995), (ii)
uncertainties in the globally averaged relative efficiency of
bromine for ozone loss as compared to chlorine (a,
assumed to lie between 40 and 200), and (iii) uncertainties
in the magnitude of the cooling in the lower stratosphere
due to uncertainties in the ozone loss profile (estimated by
Schwarzkopf and Ramaswamy (1993) to.be about +30%).
They found that the GWPs were not very sensitive to the
adopted range of possible scenarios: for future
concentrations of halocarbons nor to the exact values of the
threshold assumed. However, the GWPs for bromocarbons
were found to be extremely sensitive to the chosen value of
a, while those for CFCs were quite sensitive to the adopted
uncertainty in the negative radiative forcing in the 1980s.
Table 2.8 shows the uncertainty range for net halocarbon
GWPs over 20- and 100-year time horizons from these
sensitivity studies and compares them to GWPs for the

"depleting gases should consider both direct and indirect
terms, together with their inherent uncertainties.

Daniel et al. (1995) estimated the indirect effects of
ozone depletion upon the GWPs for halocarbons. They
assumed that the indirect and direct radiative effects of
halocarbons can be compared to one another in a globally
averaged sense, an assumption that is being tested with
two- and three-dimensional models (see Chapter 8 of
WMO/UNEP, 1995; Chapter 4 of IPCC, 1994; Section 2.4
of this report; Molnar et al., 1994), Daniel et al. (1995)
combined estimates of the negative radiative forcing due to
ozone depletion for the 1980s with an evaluation of past
and future ozone loss contributions for each halocarbon.
They assumed that the indirect negative forcing for each
halocarbon depends linearly upon its contribution to
stratospheric active chlorine or bromine release and
examined the net radiative forcing that can be attributed to
each gas. The resulting net GWPs are, of course, smaller
than the earlier values consisting of the direct (positive)
component alone (e.g., IPCC, 1994). However, a primary
conclusion of their study was that some gases, such ‘as the
CFCs, are likely still to be a net positive forcing agent,

situation is reversed. This is due to the enhanced chemical

GWPs are simple, globally averaged indices with many
limitations, as emphasised in Chapters 2 and 5 of IPCC
(1994). As noted, key factors in GWP calculations include
atmospheric lifetimes and distributions, as well as radiative
properties. For a gas whose chemical lifetime is shorter
than the time-scale for mixing in the troposphere (order of
months within a hemisphere and a year globally), the
distribution (and in turn, the chemical lifetime) can be
strongly sensitive to local sources, sinks and transport.
Current models are limited in their ability to reproduce
faithfully the global transport and chemistry of short-lived
gases in the troposphere, in part because of difficulties in
representing physical and chemical processes occurring on
relatively small spatial scales compared to the model
resolution. These processes include the vertical transport

If improved understanding shows that the ozone
depletion-related negative radiative forcing is larger than
currently estimated, it would tend to reduce the GWPs for
all ozone-depleting gases. However, this would not change
the general conclusions regarding relative GWPs of ozone-
depletors as indicated in Table 2.8. For example, if the
magnitude of negative radiative forcing associated with
ozone loss were to prove to be larger by a factor of two
(see Toumi et al., 1994), it would imply that the net GWPs
for halons would become even more negative, that for
CFC-11 would be close to zero, and that for CFC-12 would
be reduced, but would still be positive. On the other hand,
some studies suggest that the direct radiative forcings per
molecule of halocarbons may be about 20% larger than
current estimates (see Pinnock ef al., 1995). If the direct
radiative forcings per molecule of halocarbons have indeed
been underestimated by this amount, the net GWPs for
halocarbons would increase. In no case would the increase
in GWP exceed the increase in direct forcing, but would be
considerably smaller for those gases (such as halons) with
large negative contributions. The uncertainties in positive
radiative forcing contributions are presently thought to be
smaller than those relating to negative radiative forcing
described above. The numbers presented in Table 2.8
should be considered illustrative of the relative values of
GWPs among ozone-depleting gases, but their absolute
magnitudes are presently subject to considerable
quantitative uncertainties (at least +50%). Current
scientific evidence suggests that they are unlikely to be
very much more positive than the values indicated, but

In addition, aerosol optical effects on radiative forcing are
spatially variable, insofar as they depend upon factors such
as surface albedo. Due to these and other limitations (see
Section 2.3 and Chapter 3 of IPCC (1994)), GWPs for the
short-lived sulphur gases that are thought to contribute to
negative radiative forcing through aerosol formation cannot
be estimated with confidence at present and therefore were
included neither in IPCC (1994) nor are they in this
assessment,

Sensitivity studies show some of the non- -linearities
involved in ozone formation. Jacob et al. (1993b) found
that reducing NO, emissions by 50% from 1985 levels
would reduce rural ozone concentrations over the eastern
USA by about 15%, while reducing hydrocarbon emissions
by 50% would have less than a 4% effect except in the
largest urban plumes. Strand and Hov (1994) presented a
global two-dimensional chemistry transport model that
includes a parameterized treatment of convection (Strand
and Hov, 1993). These authors found that a global 50%
reduction in anthropogenic nitrogen oxide emissions led to
about twice as large a reduction in ozone production as the
same reduction in emissions of anthropogenic volatile
organic compounds. While the findings of Strand and Hov
(1994) are qualitatively similar to those reported by Jacob
et al. (1993b), the differences between them directly
illustrate the difficulty of quantitative estimation of global
GWPs for such gases.

 

    
"	Text
"several anthropogenic gases are believed to contribute to
the chemical production of tropospheric ozone which is
central in the calculation of many of the indirect
components of GWPs. Tropospheric ozone is a radiatively
important gas (particularly in the upper troposphere), and
there is evidence that its abundance has increased
significantly in the past century in many locations because
of human activities (see IPCC, 1994; Derwent, 1994).
Emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO,), non-methane
hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and methane are believed
to play prominent roles in such trends. It would be highly
desirable to determine the indirect GWPs associated with
ozone production for these gases. However, with the
important exception of methane, all of these compounds
have very short atmospheric lifetimes of days or months,
making confidence in model calculations of their spatial
distributions and source/sink relationships considerably
lower than those for long-lived gases (IPCC, 1994). The
chemical production of tropospheric ozone and oxidative
properties of the atmosphere are strongly sensitive to the
NO, abundance and emission rates; some authors have
discussed these chemical non-linearities in detail (see e.g.,
Liu et al., 1987; Sillman e al., 1990; Thompson, 1992;
Kleinman, 1994). The impact of emissions of short-lived
gases upon the radiative forcing due to tropospheric ozone
changes depends upon factors including the location of the
emission and model-calculated OH and NO, distributions,
which in turn depend upon the uncertain convection,
boundary layer, and chemical processes discussed above.

A number of recent ctudiec have examined the
"	Text
"observations. They concluded that deep convection over
the central USA acts as a “chimney” for transport of carbon
monoxide and other ozone precursors to the free
troposphere and they estimated a gross production of ozone
in the free troposphere of about 1 Gmol/day due to carbon
monoxide transport and subsequent chemistry. Jacob e¢ al.
(1993a,b) used a continental-scale photochemical model
including a subgrid nested scheme to arrive at a similar
value of 1.2 Gmol/day (see the discussion of Jacob et al. in
Thompson et al., 1994). Jacob et al. (1993b) also found
that direct export of ozone produced at low altitudes by
pollution in the USA accounted for about 4.3 Gmol/day
while NO, export led to about 4.0 Gmol/day of free
tropospheric ozone increase. All of these processes could
contribute significantly to the hemispheric ozone budget as
evidenced by comparison with the cross-tropopause
transport of ozone over the entire Northern Hemisphere in
summer of about 18-28 Gmol/day estimated by Jacob et al.
(1993b). The studies of Jacob et al. (1993a,b) and
Thompson et al. (1994) taken together underline the
importance of convection and suggest that models with
sufficient resolution and representation of physical
processes may be able to predict key elements of
tropospheric chemistry. Studies of other regions such as
Europe and Asia (e.g., Berntsen et al., 1996) show similar
results. However, these model studies are constrained only
by limited observations, and liquid phase chemistry in
clouds is also important for some gases, (e.g., Lelieveld
and Crutzen, 1994). Hence their uncertainties remain large.

The general, but not global, tendency to reduced
diurnal temperature range over land, at least since the
middle of the 20th century, noted in IPCC (1992), has
been confirmed with more data (representing more
than 40% of the global land mass). The range has
decreased in many areas because nights have warmed
more than days. Cloud cover has increased in many of
the areas with reduced diurnal temperature range.
Minimum temperature increases have been about
twice those in maximum temperatures.

"The estimate of warming since the late 19th century
has not significantly changed since the estimates in
IPCC (1990) and IPCC (1992), although the data
have been reanalysed, and more data are now
available. Global surface temperatures have
increased by about 0.3 to 0.6°C since the late-19th
century, and by about 0.2 to 0.3°C over the last 40
years (the period with most credible data). The
warming has not been globally uniform. Some areas
have cooled. The recent warming has been greatest
over the continents between 40° and 70°N.

observations of tropospheric temperature show slight
overall cooling since 1979, whereas global surface
temperature has warmed slightly over this period.
There are statistical and physical reasons (e.g., short
record lengths; the different transient effects of
volcanic activity and El Nifio-Southern Oscillation)
for expecting different recent trends in surface and
tropospheric temperatures. After adjustment for these
transient effects, which can strongly influence trends
calculated from short periods of record, both
tropospheric and surface data show slight warming
since 1979. Longer term trends in the radiosonde
data, since the 1950s, have been similar to those in
the surface record.
"	List
"Cooling of the lower stratosphere since 1979 is
shown by both Microwave Sounding Unit and
radiosonde data (as noted in IPCC, 1992), but is
larger (and probably exaggerated because of changes
in instrumentation) in the radiosonde data. The
current (1994) global stratospheric temperatures are
the coolest since the start of the instrumental record
(in both the satellite and radiosonde data).

As predicted in IPCC (1992), relatively cool surface
and tropospheric temperatures, and a relatively
warmer lower stratosphere, were observed in 1992
and 1993, following the 1991 eruption of Mt.
Pinatubo. Warmer surface and tropospheric
temperatures reappeared in 1994. Surface
temperatures for 1994, averaged globally, were in the
warmest 5% of all years since 1860.

Further work on indirect indicators of warming such
as borehole temperatures, snow cover, and glacier
recession data, confirm the IPCC (1990) and (1992)
findings that they are in substantial agreement with
the direct indicators of recent warmth. Variations in
sub-surface ocean temperatures have been consistent
with the geographical pattern of surface temperature
variations and trends.

As noted in IPCC (1992) no consistent changes can
be identified in global or hemispheric sea ice cover
since 1973 when satellite measurements began.
Northern Hemisphere sea ice extent has, however,
been generally below average in the early 1990s.

more frequent or persistent than the opposite phase

"during the cold season, concomitant with temperature
increases. A step-like decrease of precipitation
occurred after the 1960s over the subtropics and
tropics from Africa to Indonesia, as temperatures in
this region increased. The various regional changes
are consistent with changes in streamflow, lake
levels, and soil moisture (where data are available
and have been analysed).

There is evidence to suggest increased precipitation
over the central equatorial Pacific Ocean, in recent
decades, with decreases to the north and south. Little
can be said about precipitation changes elsewhere
over the ocean.

Northern Hemisphere snow cover extent has been
consistently below the 21 year (1974-1994) average
since 1988. Snow-radiation feedback has amplified
spring-time warming over mid- to high latitude
Northern Hemisphere land areas.

Evaporation appears to have decreased since 1951
over much of the former Soviet Union, and possibly
also in the USA. Evaporation appears to have
increased over the tropical oceans (although not
everywhere).

The evidence still suggests an increase of
atmospheric water vapour in the tropics, at least since
1973, as noted in IPCC (1992).

In general, cloud amount has increased over the
ocean in recent decades, with increases in convective
and middle and high-level clouds. Over many land
areas, cloud increased at least up to the 1970s. IPCC
(1990) and (1992) also reported cloud increases.

"The data on climate extremes and variability are
inadequate to say anything about global changes, but
in some regions, where data are available, there have
been decreases or increases in extreme weather
events and variability.

Other than the few areas with longer term trends to
lower rainfall (e.g., the Sahel), little evidence is
available of changes in drought frequency or intensity.

There have been few studies of variations in extreme
rainfall events and flood frequency. In some areas
with available data there is evidence of increases in
the intensity of extreme rainfall events, but no clear,
large-scale pattern has emerged.

There is some evidence of recent (since 1988)
increases in extreme extra-tropical cyclones over the
North Atlantic. Intense tropical cyclone activity in
the Atlantic has decreased over the past few decades
although the 1995 season was more active than
recent years. Elsewhere, changes in observing
systems and analysis methods confound the detection
of trends in the intensity or frequency of extreme
synoptic systems.

There has been a clear trend to fewer extremely low
minimum temperatures in several widely separated
areas in recent decades. Widespread significant
changes in extreme high temperature events have not
been observed.

IPCC (1990) concluded that, on a global average, surface
air and sea temperature had risen by between 0.3°C and
0.6°C since the mid-19th century. IPCC (1992) confirmed
this. The recent warming is re-examined here, using

vertical structure of the warming. Conventional
temperature observations are supplemented by indirect

the availability of accurate, complete, consistent series of

always be drawn does not necessarily imply that trends are
absent. It could reflect the inadequacy of the data, or the
incomplete analysis of data. Karl et al. (1995a)
demonstrate that, for many of the climate variables
important in documenting, detecting, and attributing
climate change, the data are not at present good enough for
rigorous conclusions to be reached. This especially applies
to global trends of variables with large regional variations,
such as precipitation. The final section of this chapter

The land-surface air temperature data base developed by
Jones et al. (1986a,b) and Jones (1988), and used by IPCC
(1990) and IPCC (1992), has been substantially expanded
and reanalysed (Jones, 1994a). Coverage in recent decades
has benefited most from this expansion. The resulting
global anomaly time-series are very similar, on decadal
time-scales, to those in the previous (PCC, 1990, 1992)
analyses (Figure 3.la). The small differences in the time-
series are mainly due to the addition of a few extra
Australian stations which resulted in warmer late 19th
century temperatures, relative to the earlier time-series.
The 19th century Australian temperatures may be biased
warm relative to modern recordings, because of different
methods of exposure (Nicholls et al., 1996). Figure 3.1b
shows time-series of global land temperatures updated
from Hansen and Lebedeff (1988) and Vinnikov et al.
(1990), for comparison with the Jones (1994a) time-series.

Concerns about a possible link between climate change
and desertification indicate the need for monitoring of arid
region temperatures. An analysis of the Jones (1994a)
gridded temperature anomalies for dryland areas of the
world (UNEP, 1992) yielded a significantly greater trend
for 1901-1993 (0.62°C) than for the land areas as a whole
(0.44°C). Trends for dry lands were greatest in Central and
North America (nearly 0.8°C) and least in South America
(a little over 0.3°C). They were also significantly greater in
the least arid subclass (nearly 0.8°C) than in the most arid
subclass (around 0.3°C). The total arid area is only about
14% of the land surface. Even if all the greater warming in
these areas was due to desertification, this would only have
contributed a few hundredths of a degree to the observed
global warming.

"Parker, 1995) has been used to estimate improved
adjustments to ships’ sea surface temperature (SST) data
obtained up to 1941, to compensate for heat losses from
uninsulated (mainly canvas) or partly-insulated (mainly
wooden) buckets. The time-series of global SST anomalies
is very similar to that in IPCC (1992) (Figure 3.2). The
differences compared with IPCC (1992) mainly result from
an improved formulation of the heat transfers affecting
wooden buckets and an improved climatology in
the Southern Ocean. This climatology incorporates, for
1982 onwards, satellite-based data, using a Laplacian
blending technique (Reynolds, 1988) to remove overall
biases relative to the in situ data (Parker et al., 1995).
In addition, following Folland and Parker (1995),
slightly fewer wooden buckets are assumed than was
the case in IPCC (1992), and the SST data in the analysis
of Jones and Briffa (1992) are no longer incorporated.
The data used to construct the night-time marine air
temperature (NMAT) series in Figure 3.2 largely avoid
daytime heating of ships’ decks and were corrected
independently of SST from the mid-1890s onwards
(Bottomley et al, 1990; Folland and Parker, 1995). The
NMAT data confirm the trends in SST.

"IPCC (1992) cited results of Jones et al. (1990) which
indicated that urbanisation influences have yielded, on
average, a warming of less than 0.05°C during the 20th
century in their data over the global land. In specific
regions, however, urbanisation influences may be
significant. Portman (1993) found that the average
warming of 0.22°C between 1954 and 1983 over northern
China in the gridded data of Jones et al. (1986a) was nearly
as large as the 0.25°C warming in this period averaged
over seven uncorrected large urban stations; Portman’s
adjustments using rural stations, however, suggested that
there was in fact a regional cooling of about 0.05°C. The
urbanisation warming trends were greatest in spring.
Differences from Jones et al. (1990) and Wang et al.
(1990), who found a smaller or no urbanisation warming
trend in eastern China, may have resulted from the
different, though overlapping, region covered. Hulme er al.
(1994) note that urbanisation cannot fully account for the
significant warming trends over eastern Asia. Christy and
Goodridge (1994) found that the five longest term
Californian stations used by Hansen and Lebedeff (1988)
all had more positive temperature trends in 1910-89 than
the median of 112 Californian stations. Moberg and
Alexandersson (1995) found evidence of urban warming
affecting apparent trends in Sweden. On the other hand,
Barros and Camilloni (1994) note that the urbanisation
effect in Buenos Aires relative to the surrounding rural
environment has decreased since the 1950s. Remote
sensing techniques hold promise for the eventual
worldwide estimation of urban temperature bias (Johnson
et al., 1994).

"A variety of tests (Parker ef al., 1994) suggests that the
sampling uncertainty on the smoothed curves in Figure 3.3
is possibly within 0.05°C since the 1880s. However, these
findings take no account of unsampled regions so a trend
uncertainty of 0.1°C/century may be more realistic (Karl et
al., 1994), The instrumental bias uncertainty is assessed by
Parker et al. (1994) as less than 0.1°C for land, around
0.1°C for SST, and less than 0.15°C for the combination,
since the 1880s, consistent with preliminary estimates in
IPCC (1992). In addition, an urbanisation uncertainty of
less than 0.05°C is estimated (Section 3.2.2.1). The overall
uncertainty remains about 0.15°C and leads to an estimate
of 0.3 to 0.6°C for global near-surface warming since the
late 19th century, unchanged from the estimates of IPCC

While information on changes in radiosonde sensors is
rarely complete, Gaffen (1994) reported on the effects of
documented changes in the temperature sensors and found
that at least 43% of the stations used by Angell have clear
heterogeneities. Oort and Liu’s data will also have been
affected. The net effect of these heterogeneities was to
impose a spurious cooling trend (in addition to that from
the humidity sensors noted above) on the time-series since
1958. The magnitude of the tropospheric impact appears to
be small. However, the lower stratospheric time-series was
found to have been significantly affected, particularly in
the tropics and Southern Hemisphere, so as to bias the
trend calculation to be cooler than actual. In addition
Parker and Cox (1995) suggest that early radiosonde
balloons were more likely to burst in cold conditions,
biasing the incomplete data towards warmth, and giving a
spurious cooling trend in the lower stratosphere as balloons
were strengthened. Angell’s global lower-stratospheric

Compilations for monitoring long-term. changes of
temperature aloft using radiosondes have been made by
Angell (1988 and updates) and by Oort and Liu (1993).
However, the sensors which measure temperature and
humidity in radiosondes have undergone many changes in the
past 40 years, and these changes have had significant effects
on estimates of long-term trends (Gaffen, 1994; Parker and
Cox, 1995). Humidity is important both on its own account
(Section 3.3.7) and because it affects air density, which is
often used as a surrogate for temperature. Elliott et al. (1994)
calculate that spurious “drying” of the mid-troposphere (850-
300 hPa) due to improved radiosonde sensors has led to a
spurious cooling since 1958 of 0.05 to 0.1°C/decade. This
spurious cooling is primarily related to sensor changes in the
1970s. An additional aspect of uncertainty is related to the
non-uniform geographic distribution of stations since vast
areas over the oceans, particularly in the Southern
Hemisphere, are not monitored at all (Trenberth and Olson
1991), and coverage has declined over the oceans and parts of
the tropics (Parker and Cox, 1995).

MSU tropospheric trend from 1979 to May 1995 was

tropospheric trends for 1979-1993 appear to be partly a
result of the greater influence of volcanic eruptions and
ENSO on tropospheric temperatures, Hansen et al. (1995)
also demonstrate that natural variability can account for
some of the apparent differences between surface and

lower tropospheric data.

Lower stratospheric temperatures (17-22 km or 100-50 hPa)
have demonstrated marked changes over the past few
decades (Figure 3.7b). Sudden warmings were caused by
infrared-absorbing aerosols from volcanoes (Nyamuragira
1981 with El Chichon 1982, and Mt. Pinatubo 1991). From
1979 through May 1995, the MSU global trend was
~0.34°C/decade. The greater cooling in the radiosonde data
is at least partly due to changes in the radiosondes and
undersampling of the global atmosphere, for the reasons
outlined in Section 3.2.3.1. A similar rate of cooling
(-0.36°C/decade) has probably occurred since 1964, based
on radiosonde data (Christy, 1995). Labitzke and van Loon
(1994) examined daily historical analyses of the Northern
Hemisphere lower stratosphere and concluded that the
cooling was greatest at a height of 18-20 km at all latitudes
in summer, and in the polar regions also in early winter.

Mountain glaciers provide integrated climatic evidence

Jength extend back to the 19th century in many regions,
and even to 1600 AD in Europe. Length reduction of
mountain glaciers provides easily detectable evidence from
cold regions that fast and worldwide climatic change has
taken place over the past century (Haeberli ef al., 1989).
The factors affecting glaciers, and a description of
observed changes over the past century, are discussed in
Chapter 7. The 20th century glacier retreat is consistent
with a warming in alpine regions of 0.6-1.0°C (Schwitter

Bindoff and McDougall (1994) inferred that the change
between 300 m and 700 m resulted from warming at the
surface where the water masses were formed during
contact with the atmosphere. It appears that the upper
ocean warming of these two basins is a reflection of the
surface warming at the surface at latitudes of 40-50°S. The
cooling at greater depth in the Indian Ocean appears to be a
reflection of surface cooling at higher latitudes where there
is poor surface coverage.

Following the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in June 1991, clear-
sky solar radiation incident at the Earth’s surface was reduced
by about 3% for several months because of aerosol scattering
(Dutton and Christy, 1992). Global tropospheric temperature
anomalies cooled until August 1992 and then warmed in an
irregular fashion (Figure 3.7a; see also Section 5.3.1.2). In the
16-year MSU lower troposphere time-series the cvolest
seasonal anomalies of the entire record occurred for the
Northern Hemisphere in summer 1992 and for the Southern
Hemisphere in summer 1992-3. Temperatures have increased

Seasonal series of land-surface air temperatures indicate
that the cooling in 1992, which probably resulted from the
Mt. Pinatubo eruption, was particularly marked in summer
and autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. Robock and Mao
(1995) found that this maximum cooling pattern, in the
Northern Hemisphere summer of the year after the eruption,
agrees with that after the five other largest volcanic eruptions
since 1883. The winter warming pattern over the Northern
Hemisphere continents in 1991-92 appears to be an indirect,
dynamical response to the tropical stratospheric warming
after the eruption (Graf et al., 1993).

Groisman er al. (1991) evaluated information on the
history of gauges and observational procedures over the
former Soviet Union. Using this information they adjusted
the measured precipitation for changes in instrumentation.
Their adjusted data still show substantial increases of
annual precipitation (~10%/100yr). The increase has been
larger during winter than in summer. Much of the increase
has been due to increases in the first half of the 20th

Consistent continental-scale trends of precipitation are
not apparent through Central and South America. In part,
this is due to the ENSO phenomenon, the influence of
which varies across the continent. The relatively frequent
E] Nifio episodes during the past few decades has ted to
decadal-scale precipitation variations in some areas. For
example, precipitation has decreased over the western
slopes of Central America, where the influence of ENSO is
clearly evident, but March-May rainfall in the Parana-
Paraguay River Basin of south-central South America has
increased.

"In North America annual precipitation has increased
(Karl et al., 1993b; Groisman and Easterling, 1994). The
increase in the contiguous USA is most apparent after 1950
and is in large part due to increases during the autumn
(September to November). Positive trends are apparent
throughout much of northern Canada and Alaska during the
past 40 years (Groisman and Easterling, 1994). Twentieth
century station data over southern Canada and the northern
USA (45-55°N) indicate increases of precipitation of
10-15%, with increases of about 5% averaged across the
contiguous USA. Increases are more prevalent in the
eastern two-thirds of North America (Findlay et al., 1994;
Lettenmaier et al., 1994).

Time-varying 2 precipitation biases in the tropics and
subtropics are not as severe as those in the mid- and high
latitudes where higher wind speeds, smaller droplet size,
and frozen precipitation all contribute to higher biases. The
20th century increase in precipitation in high latitudes is
not matched by increases through the continental tropical
and subtropical climates. Precipitation decreases,
especially since mid-century, dominate large regions of the
tropics and subtropics from North Africa east to Southeast
Asia and Indonesia (Figures 3.9 and 3.10). Many of these
areas with recent decreases are areas where droughts
usually accompany El Nifio episodes, So the decreases
probably reflect the influence of the recent relatively
frequent El Nifio episodes (Section 3.4.2).

"Australian and New Zealand precipitation is also heavily
influenced by ENSO, and is characterised by large inter-
annual fluctuations. There is evidence of an increase of
summer rainfall (Nicholls and Lavery, 1992) in much of
eastern Australia after the 1940s (with clusters of wet years
in the 1950s and 1970s), although the north-east has
suffered from frequent droughts in the last decade,
associated with the relatively frequent El Nifio events. The
last four decades have seen a decrease in eastern Australian
annual rainfall. There has been a long-term sustained
decrease of winter rainfall in the far south-west, which has
been linked to regional circulation changes (Allan and
Haylock, 1993; see Section 3.4.4) and perhaps exacerbated

century are latitudinally dependent. Time-varying
measurement biases have been addressed in several
countries (Hanssen-Bauer and Ferland, 1994), where they
are likely to be most serious (Karl et al., 1993b). Overall,
the data suggest an increase of precipitation in northern
Europe and a decrease in southern Europe during the 20th
century. In northern Europe (north of 55°N) Hanssen-
Bauer et al. (1990) and Jénsson (1994) report an increase
of precipitation since the 1960s for the Norwegian Arctic
islands and Iceland while increasing precipitation has also
been observed over the Faroe Islands (Frich, 1994).
Denmark has had similar changes (Brazdil, 1992). West of
the Scandinavian mountains increases have been reported
(Frich, 1994; Hanssen-Bauer and Férland, 1994), but not in
Finland (Heino, 1994). There is strong seasonality

Throughout Africa marked variations in rainfall are
evident (Figures 3.9 and 3.10). Rainfall in Sahelian West
Africa from the late 1960s to 1993 was well below the
amounts received earlier in the century, and over the last
few decades has been about half that of the wet 1950s.
Similar dry periods occurred during the historical and
recent geologic past (Nicholson, 1994a,b; see Section
3.6.2). The recent period exhibits some differences in
character from previous dry periods, namely a tendency
towards continental-scale dryness (Nicholson, 1995). In
recent years precipitation in eastern Northern Africa and
the Arabian Peninsula has returned to levels more typical
of the first-half of the century. Sahel rainfall in 1994 was
greater than in any year since the 1960s.

One of the most complex and important precipitation
systems in the Northern Hemisphere is the Asian summer
monsoon. There has been a notable absence of very heavy
monsoon onset (May-June) rains along the Yangtze River
Valley of China (‘Chen et al., 1992) since about 1970,
although total warm season rainfall has changed little.
Indian summer monsoon rainfall reveals high interannual
and decadal variability (Sontakke et al., 1992, 1993;
Parthasarathy et al., 1992, 1994). The data indicate two wet
periods of about 30 years (~1871-1900 and 1931-60) and
two drier 30-year periods (1901-30 and 1961-90). Figure
3.10 indicates low rainfall through much of south and
south-east Asia in the last few decades. At least some of
this decrease reflects the influence of the recent
frequent/intense El Nifio episodes.

Strong low-frequency relationships exist between
temperature and land-based precipitation, on regional
space-scales. Figure 3.11 indicates that the relationship
between multi-decadal fluctuations of precipitation and
temperature is latitudinally dependent. For the mid- to high
latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere simultaneous
increases of temperature and precipitation have been
observed, but for the tropics, subtropics, and mid-latitudes
of the Southern Hemisphere warmer temperatures have
been associated with decreases of precipitation. This latter
characteristic is a dominant feature of the recent increase of
global temperature beginning in the mid-1970s.

Measurement of changes of precipitation over the oceans
presents extreme difficulties (IPCC, 1990, 1992). Multi-
decadal surface-based observations from gauges are limited
to very small atolls. Space-based observations, although
providing more or less continuous coverage, have several
limitations, not least of which is that measurements to
directly estimate precipitation are not available until 1979,
with the operation of the Micro-Wave Sounding Unit
(MSU) aboard NOAA polar orbiting satellites. As a result,
researchers have had to resort to the use of data such as
real-time cloud imaging, atmospheric temperature
profiling, etc. to infer changes of precipitation.
"	Text
"In IPCC (1990) evidence was presented to suggest that
the OLR data analysed by Nitta and Yamada (1989)
indicated an increase of tropical precipitation. A re-
examination of the biases inherent in these data led
Chelliah and Arkin (1992) and IPCC (1992) to conclude
that a substantial portion of the increase of precipitation
since 1974 was not climate-induced because of OLR biases
due to changes in equatorial crossing time and uncertainties
in sensor calibration (Gadgil et al., 1992). However, new
analyses by Graham (1995) using satellite data, a coarse
Tropical Pacific Ocean island data set, and model-derived
moisture flux convergence based on observed SSTs
suggest an increase of tropical Pacific precipitation
between two six-year periods before and after 1976, the
time of the commencement of a decadal-scale fluctuation
in the atmospheric circulation over the Pacific Ocean
(Trenberth and Hurrell, 1994; see Section 3.4.3). Salinger
et al. (1995a) analysed trends of precipitation from tropical
Pacific atolls and islands. Central and eastern equatorial
Pacific rainfall increased in the mid-1970s, concomitant
with the change to increased frequency of El Nifio episodes
and the observed decreased precipitation in the south-west
Pacific and in some land areas affected by ENSO (Figure
3.10).
"	Text
"Three methods (Garcia, 1981; Arkin and Ardanuy, 1989;
Spencer, 1993) have been used to infer decadal variability
of precipitation over the oceans from space-based
instruments. These are: identifying Highly Reflective
Clouds (HRC); measuring cloud top temperatures from
Outgoing Long-wave Radiation (OLR); and the use of the
Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU). The HRC data is
limited by poor resolution of the diurnal cycle, the
subjective nature of the technique, variations from satellite
to satellite, and spatial sampling primarily confined to the
tropics and subtropics. The OLR data are limited to those
areas where precipitation is dominated by cold cloud top:
temperatures, again principally the tropics and subtropics.
Additionally, they are based on observations from a
number of instruments on successive satellites, and
temporal inhomogeneities associated with satellite drift and
instrument calibrations have affected the data set.
Therefore, any estimate of precipitation change based on
the HRC and OLR data sets is embedded with internal
inhomogeneities. Being a more direct measure of rainfall,
the MSU data avoid some of the limitations of the HRC
and OLR. Nonetheless, these measurements are spatially
limited, restricted to unfrozen ocean areas, liquid
precipitation, and suffer from the low spatial resolution of
the instrument, as well as diurnal sampling inadequacies
(Negri et al., 1994).

There have been several analyses of changes in snow

changes of precipitation and temperature. A synthesis of
20th century station snow depth measurements for the
former Soviet Union (Meshcherskaya et al., 1995)

over the European portion of the former Soviet Union with
a smaller decrease over the Asian sectors of the former

"While satellite remote sensing is being explored as a
source of data on snow depth water equivalent, station data
provide the only information on snowfall and snow depth
over periods longer than about two decades. Station
measurements indicate that annual snowfall has increased
over the period 1950-90 by ~20% over northern Canada
(north of 55°N) and by ~11% over Alaska (Groisman and
Easterling, 1994). Total precipitation has increased in all
these regions (Section 3.3.2.1); in southern Canada and the
northern USA however, the increase of precipitation has
been accompanied by higher ratios of liquid to solid
precipitation as the temperatures have also increased. A
small decrease of snowfall has been observed in the
45-55°N latitudinal belt. Decadal summaries of snowfall
measurements in China have been compiled by Li (1987),

"particularly apparent in spring (Figure 3.12). The snow
cover of summer and autumn of these recent years has also
been low, while winter snow cover exhibits less apparent
decadal changes. The annual mean extent of snow cover
has decreased by about 10% during the past 21 years over
the Northern Hemisphere. Percentage decreases have been
similar over North America and Asia (Groisman et al.,
1994b). The decrease in snow cover extent is closely
coupled to an increase in temperature (Figure 3.12). The
warming has been strong in spring over the northern land
areas (Chapman and Walsh, 1993; Parker et al., 1994).
This is also reflected in earlier lake ice melting as reported
by Skinner (1993), earlier snowmelt related floods on
rivers in west-central Canada (Burn, 1994) and California
(Dettinger and Cayan, 1995), and reduced duration of river
ice over the former Soviet Union (Ginsburg, ef al. 1992;
Soldatova, 1993). Groisman et al. (1994a,b) have shown
that snow-radiation feedback can account for up to 50% of
the springtime April-May warming over the Northern
Hemisphere land areas since the early 1970s. These results
help explain why the increase of surface air temperatures
over the Northern Hemisphere land areas has been more
significant in spring than in other seasons.

"The Caspian Sea is the largest closed water body in the
world. Its sea level has been measured since 1837 (Figure

stable until the 1930s when it fell 1.6 m in six years. The
level abruptly began to rise in 1977, from record low
values, perhaps the lowest values since the 14th century.
The main contribution to the rapid decrease of sea level in
the 1930s was reduced runoff into the Sea, but the most
recent increase is attributed to a combination of reduced
evaporation (Section 3.3.6.1; Figure 3.15), increases in
runoff, and an engineered blockage of sea water into the

Lake Superior has been slightly below its long-term
average since 1988 (Figure 3.13). Levels of the Great Salt
Lake in Utah are somewhat similar to those in the Great
Lakes, but the Lake has recently been regulated with the
introduction of pumps to relieve the historic peak water
levels of 1986-87. The Great Slave Lake, located in the
Northwest Territories of Canada has also continued to be at
above average levels for the past several years compared to
the relatively low levels observed during the 1940s.
Although there has been regulation on one of the rivers
flowing into the Great Slave Lake since 1968, comparison
of the water levels of the Great Slave and Great Bear Lakes
suggests it has had limited influence on annual or decadal
fluctuations.

The oceans provide a source of moisture for the
atmosphere and subsequent precipitation over land.
Estimating long-term changes of oceanic evaporation is
very difficult, and all estimates must be viewed with
considerable caution due to time varying biases in the data.
Bulk aerodynamic parametrizations are the only practical
means of comprehensively calculating evaporation over
regions as large as ocean basins and over multi-decadal
time-scales. Routine marine weather observations of wind,
temperature, and humidity, among other elements, are
available over broad sectors of the oceans for the past four
decades. These observations allow estimation of
evaporation based on the sea surface saturation specific
humidity, the specific humidity of the overlying air, and
the near-surface wind speed.

"Other areas of the oceans are known to exhibit multi-
decadal changes in evaporation. For example, there was a
transition from warm to cool conditions in the western and
central North Pacific associated with a cluster of winters
with deep Aleutian Lows beginning in the winter of
1976-77 (Douglas et al., 1982; Venrick et al., 1987;
Trenberth, 1990; Miller et a/., 1994; Trenberth and Hurrell,
1994), Since such transitions involve a redistribution of the
paths of storms across the Pacific basin there are large-
scale changes in the wind, temperature, and humidity with
concomitant changes of evaporation. The magnitude of
these changes over the North Pacific basin is estimated to
be between 0.2 and 0.4 mm/day, with evaporation
increasing over the western North Pacific, but decreasing
over the Gulf of Alaska.

Monitoring atmospheric moisture presents many
difficulties. Because the residence time of water vapour in
the atmosphere is short, about 10 days, its distribution is
horizontally, as well as vertically, heterogeneous.
Therefore observations at many places and levels are
necessary for adequate representation of climatically
important changes. Measurement problems also make
detecting trends of water vapour difficult. Most of the
information about tropospheric water vapour comes from
radiosonde measurements taken for daily weather
forecasts. Unfortunately, this instrumentation is not capable
of accurate measurements at the low temperatures and very
low moisture conditions of the upper troposphere,
stratosphere, and polar regions of the planet. Another
serious problem with radiosonde data stems from the
changes of instruments and reporting practices that have
occurred through the period of record. About a dozen
different manufacturers supply radiosondes to the world’s
weather services, some with quite different sensor designs.

"Marine weather observation procedures were not
designed to provide long-term homogeneous climate data,
and several problems exist that can obscure climate-
induced changes. Marine data show an increase of wind
speed (Cardone et al., 1990) over the four decades since
World War IT, believed to be largely artificial, involving
changes from Beaufort scale sea state estimates of wind
speed to anemometer observations (Ramage, 1987).
Posmentier et al. (1989) argued an increase in wind is
inconsistent with observed trends in tropical sea level and
sea surface temperature, which in the eastern tropical
Pacific have increased rather than decreased as would be
expected under an increasing trade wind regime. The
notion of no global increase in wind speed is consistent
with the calculations of Ward (1992, 1994) who used sea
level pressure gradients to estimate changes in wind speed.
Even after removing the apparent wind bias however,
evaporation was estimated to have increased by more than
0.5 mm/day over the tropical oceans (10°S to 14°N) during
the last four decades (Flohn er al., 1992). Graham (1995)
used model calculations to suggest that increases of
evaporation should also have occurred in the tropical
Pacific, even without any increase of wind speed.

Hense er al. (1988) report an upward trend of moisture in
the 700-500 hPa layer in the western Pacific from 1965 to
1986, but the data prior to 1973 are not necessarily
homogeneous because of a change in instrumentation in
1973 (Elliott and Gaffen, 1991). Elliott et al., (1991)
document a moisture increase in the equatorial Pacific from
1973-86 and Gaffen et ai. (1991) using more stations also
found an increase of specific humidity on the order of 10%
from 1973 to 1986, but the scatter of data is such that this
value is only a rough estimate of the order-of-magnitude of
the change. Much of the change occurred during a
relatively brief interval, beginning about 1977 (see Section
3.4.3). An increase in tropical western Pacific moisture was
also found by Gutzler (1992) at four tropical island
stations. There were increases in humidity throughout the

The atmospheric circulation is the main control behind
regional changes in wind, temperature, precipitation, soil
moisture and other climatic variables. Variations in many
of these variables are strongly related through large-scale
features of the atmospheric circulation, as well as through
interactions involving the land and ocean surfaces (IPCC,
1990). Two well-known examples of such large-scale
features are the El Nifio-Southern Oscillation and the North
Atlantic Oscillation, both of which are closely related to
climatic fluctuations in many areas. Evidence of associated
changes or variations in the atmospheric circulation may
enhance confidence in the reality of observed changes and

decrease of precipitation occurred after the 1960s over the
subtropics and tropics from Africa to Indonesia, as
temperatures increased. Many of the changes in
precipitation over land are consistent with changes in
streamflow, lake levels, and soil moisture. There is
evidence to suggest increased precipitation over the
equatorial Pacific Ocean (near the dateline) in recent
decades, with decreases to the north and south. Based on
the available data, there has been a small positive (1%)
global trend in precipitation over land during the 20th

Comprehensive, long-term monitoring of changes and
variations in the El Nifio-Southern Oscillation and North
Atlantic Oscillation, and the atmospheric circulation in
general, requires the analysis of meteorological and
oceanic fields on a routine basis. Analyses of such fields
are performed every day by national meteorological
services. However, the analysis schemes, their
observational basis, and even the theoretical meteorology
underlying the analysis have all changed dramatically over
the decades (Trenberth, 1996). Thus, these analyses are of
only limited use for analysis of variations and changes in
circulation over extended periods. Where such analyses are
used, their results need to be confirmed by analysis based
solely upon high-quality station data. The lack of
homogeneity in the atmospheric analyses restricted the
variety of atmospheric circulation features IPCC (1990)
decided could be examined with confidence. The same
problem occurred in IPCC (1992), and again here only a
small number of the more reliable circulation features are
examined, namely the El Nifio-Southern Oscillation and
the North Atlantic Oscillation. The discussion of a possible
recent increase in the intensity of the winter atmospheric
circulation over the extra-tropical Pacific and Atlantic

regions do not always correspond with each other. One
coral record (Dunbar et al., 1994) is from the Galapagos

large negative excursions of the SOI and warmer than

values of the SOI. The dominance of time-scales of 2-5
years in the E! Nifio-Southern Oscillation is apparent in
this figure. The periodicity of El Nifio-Southern Oscillation

post-1989 period of negative SOI with earlier periods. It
may be, for instance, that the period of negative SOI values
starting around 1911 was comparable with the recent
period. Trenberth and Hoar (1996) examined the recent El
Nifio-Southern Oscillation behaviour using Darwin data
only. The Darwin data are continuous and therefore allow a
strict comparison of the post-1989 behaviour with that of
earlier periods, although by themselves they may not
provide a complete representation of the El Nifio-Southern

the post-1989 behaviour is very unusual. From the Darwin

such an extended period of negative SOI. Trenberth and
Hoar fitted statistical models to the 1882 to 1981 Darwin

The lower frequency mode is identified as a temperature
fluctuation with largest amplitude in the North Atlantic and
surrounding continents where the period appears to vary
regionally from 50 to 88 years. Relative to the record from
1850 on, it corresponds to a much colder period from the
late 1800s to about 1920, much warmer than normal from
about 1930 to 1960, and another cooler period in the 1970s
and 1980s (Kushnir, 1994; Schlesinger and Ramankutty,
1994). The sea level pressures and surface winds
associated with this pattern have been explored by Deser
and Blackmon (1993) and Kushnir (1994) who find an
anomalous cyclonic circulation during the warmer years
and anticyclonic during the cooler years, centred in the
mid-Atlantic near 40°N.

IPCC (1990) used the smoothed standardised difference
of December-February atmospheric pressure between
Ponta Delgada, Azores, and Stykkisholmur, Iceland, to
describe the variations in the westerly flow in the North
Atlantic, and thus the NAO. Figure 3.18 updates IPCC
(1990) and reveals strong westerlies since 1989. It also
highlights an apparent near century time-scale variation in
the westerly flow with peaks around 1910 and at the
present. The amplitude of this variation is as large as one
standard deviation of the interannual variations. Flohn et
al. (1992), using meteorological analyses, reported a
deepening of quasi-stationary cyclones in the Northern
Atlantic and in the Northern Pacific leading to an
intensification of the extra-tropical circulation, most
pronounced during winter, supporting the suggestions of
intensification in Figures 3.17 and 3.18.

The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is of interest
because of its relationship to regional precipitation and
temperature variations. The NAO is a large-scale
alternation of atmospheric pressure between the North
Atlantic regions of subtropical high pressure (centred near
the Azores) and subpolar low surface pressure (extending
south and east of Greenland). The state of the NAO
determines the strength and orientation of the poleward
pressure gradient over the North Atlantic, and hence the
speed and direction of the mid-latitude westerlies across
that ocean. These, in turn, affect the tracks of European-
sector low-pressure storm systems (Lamb and Peppler,
1991), One extreme of the NAO coincides with strong
westerlies across the North Atlantic, cold winters in
western Greenland and warm ones in northern Europe,
while the other NAO extreme is associated with the
opposite pattern. In addition, precipitation over Europe is
related to the NAO (Hurrell, 1995). The recent decade-long
winter dry conditions over southern Europe and the
Mediterranean, and the wet anomalies from Iceland
eastward to Scandinavia, are related to the recent persistent

positive phase of the NAO (Hurrell, 1995).

One aspect of atmospheric circulation variations
considered recently is the possible impact of volcanic
eruptions. The eruption of Mt. Pinatubo (Section 3.2.6) led
to studies which suggested, based on geographical
variations in temperature after major eruptions, that heating
of the tropical stratosphere resulting from volcanic aerosols
drives an enhanced zonal wind (Groisman, 1992; Robock
and Mao, 1992; Graf et al., 1993). This stronger wind
advects warmer maritime air over the continents, leading to
warming, in the Northern Hemisphere winter, in higher
latitudes. Such variations are limited to a year or two after
a major eruption. So, only a protracted change in the level
of volcanic activity could be expected to lead to a long-
term atmospheric circulation change.

"A near-global atmospheric pressure data set (Allan,
1993) and other data have been used to examine longer
term variations in circulation in the Indian Ocean, since
late last century (Allan et al., 1995: Salinger et al., 1995b).
Circulation patterns in the periods 1870 to 1900 and 1950
to 1990 were more similar to each other than to those in the
1900 to 1950 period. These variations were most apparent
in the mid- to high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere. A
more meridional long-wave pattern occurred in the early
and late periods, and a more zonal flow regime occurred in
the 1900 to 1950 period. This research suggests that the
vigour of the atmospheric circulation has increased since
the 1950s, particularly around the anticyclones in the
southern Indian Ocean during summer, and Australia in
winter. These high pressure features were found to wax and
wane, but show no distinct displacements in the latitude of

Some reported variations in temperature and precipitation
have been related to observed regional variations in
atmospheric circulation. Analysis of trends in 700 hPa
heights (O’Lenic, 1995) provides some evidence linking the
regional circulation anomalies to the trends in surface
temperature over the past 40 years, e.g., negative trend in
the North Pacific and positive over western Canada. Ward
(1992, 1994) demonstrated that the recent low rainfalls in
the Sahel are also related to circulation anomalies. [PCC
(1990) pointed out that changes in SSTs on a global scale
played a major role in the reduction of Sahel precipitation.
Lare and Nicholson (1994) have again reiterated the
potential role of land-surface changes in the prolonged dry
period in the Sahel, but Shinoda and Kawamura (1994a)
suggest that changes in the SSTs of the Indian Ocean and
the tropical North and South Adantic modulate different
aspects of the Sahel rainfall. Specifically, the contrasting
anomalies of North and South Atlantic SSTs play a major
role in the year-to-year latitudinal displacement of the
rainbelt and the strong warming trend of the SSTs in the
Indian Ocean (Figure 3.4) is associated with large-scale
subsidence over the rainbelt. A new analysis of the
interannual and decadal variations of the summer rains over
the Sahel (Shinoda and Kawamura, 1994b) however,
suggests that the decreased rainfall from the 1950s to the
1980s primarily resulted from weakened convection over
the entire monsoonal rainbelt, rather than a systematic
displacement of its central position.

evidence of only a small global increase of variability in

temperature variability increased slightly over the period of

Concerns are often expressed that the climate may be more
variable (i.e, more droughts and extended wet periods) or
extreme (i.¢., more frequent severe weather events) now
than in the past. A possible source of confusion in any
discussion of variability is that variability of the climate
can be defined and calculated in several ways. Apparently
contradictory conclusions may be reached from the
different definitions. For instance, using the standard
deviation or a similar measure to determine variability will,
in certain circumstances, result in different conclusions
from the use of interperiod differences (e.g., first
differences of annual means) as a measure of variability.
Care needs to be taken in the comparison of variabilities
calculated and defined in different ways. Analysis of how
the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events
(e.g., tornadoes) have varied over time is also difficult,
because of inhomogeneities in the data. Comparisons over
longer periods, such as comparing late 20th century
extremes with those of the late 19th century, are especially
problematic because of changes in instrumentation and
analysis methods, as well as site and exposure changes.

There is some evidence of recent increased storminess
around the North Atlantic, although there are doubts about
the consistency of the meteorological analyses from which
this increase has been derived. Hand-drawn analyses of
Atlantic surface pressure patterns, produced since 1956 by
Seewetteramt, Hamburg, have been used to analyse the
annual occurrence of extra-tropical cyclones (also known
as low pressure systems or depressions) with minimum
pressures below 950 hPa (Dronia, 1991). Little trend was
found, except for an abrupt increase in frequency since
1988. Stein and Hense (1994), using daily grid-point
pressure data, deduced that the North Atlantic winters since
1988/89 had been affected by a higher frequency of
extreme low pressure systems than at any time since 1880.
Schinke (1993) used once-daily’ analyses (USA analyses
1939 to 1964; thereafter German analyses) to count the
number of storms with pressures below certain thresholds.
This study revealed a substantial increase in the number of
severe storms in the North Atlantic area, in the early 1970s.
The mean central pressure showed a decreasing trend.
Stein and Hense (1994) also deduced an increase in the
numbers of extreme lows in the early 1970s, but concluded
that this increase does not appear to be significant, when

"estimates was used throughout the period of record, the
pre-1970 data were statistically indistinguishable from the
post-1970 data. Landsea (1993) suggested that the Atlantic
hurricane intensity record was probably also biased. Winds
were 5 kt higher before 1970, compared with hurricanes
with the same minimum pressure after 1970. After
adjusting for this bias a substantial downward trend in
intense hurricane activity is still apparent. There remains a
possibility that not all the bias in the Atlantic records has
been removed, because of the remarkable drop in apparent
intensity from 1970, the same year the artificial drop in
frequency of intense typhoons appeared in the north-west
Pacific. However, this step decrease was also observed in
the frequency of storms hitting the USA. These storms
were categorised by using minimum sea level pressure
recorded at landfall. Such observations should not be as
suspect as observations over the ocean. Also, the decrease
in hurricanes appears to reflect a relationship between
hurricane activity and Sahel rainfall (Landsea and Gray,
1992; Goldenberg and Shapiro, 1996). Finally, hurricane
activity is also weaker during El Nifio episodes. The
relatively more frequent El Nifio episodes since the mid-
1970s (see Section 3.4.2) would, therefore, have led to a
tendency for weak hurricane activity. There are strong
grounds, therefore, for concluding that the decrease in
Atlantic intense hurricane activity is real (Landsea et al.,
1996). However, Karl et al. (1995d) found no trend in the
numbers of hurricanes crossing the USA coast since 1900,

Long-term rainfall observing sites can be used to examine
changes in the frequency of intense 24-hour rainfall totals.
Iwashima and Yamamoto (1993) did this, for 55 stations in
Japan and for 14 stations in the contiguous USA, by
determining the decades in which the three highest daily
rainfall totals were recorded. A trend towards higher
frequencies of extreme rainfalls in recent decades was
evident. Such a trend was also found by Karl er al. (1995c)
who analysed the trends in the percentage of total seasonal
and annual precipitation occurring in heavy daily rainfall
events (days with rainfalls exceeding 50.8 mm) over the
USA (1911 to 1992), the former Soviet Union (1935 to
1989), and China (1952 to 1989). A significant trend to
increased percentages of rainfall falling in heavy events is
evident in the USA, largely due to a strong increase in
extreme rainfall events during the warm season. A similar
trend is also apparent in heavy rainfall events calculated from
3-day total rainfalls. Trends to more extreme rainfall events
were not apparent in the other regions. A trend to increased
annual rainfall around the periphery of the North Atlantic,
since early this century, also appears to reflect an increase in
the number of heavy rainfall events (Frich, 1994).

(1993) found no evidence of increased occurrence of strong
or violent tornadoes in the USA, although the numbers of
reports of less severe tornadoes appears to have increased,

One extreme that might be anticipated to change in
frequency if mean temperatures increased is the frequency
of frosts or freezes. Decreases over the past few decades in
the frequency of extreme low minimum temperatures or the
length of the frost season have been reported for several
widely separated locations (Salinger et al., 1990; Karl et al.,
1991; Watkins, 1991; Bootsma, 1994; Palecki, 1994; Cooter
and LeDuc, 1995; Stone et al., 1996). Cooter and LeDuc,

eastern USA now begins 11 days earlier than 30 years ago.

studies exhibited a decrease in frost occurrence.

Changes in frequency of extreme maximum (daytime)
temperatures were less consistent than was the case for
minimum temperatures. Across the USA a spatially
complicated pattern of variations in extreme maximum
temperatures is evident, with no evidence of a country-
wide increase in extremes (Karl et al., 1991; Balling and
Idso, 1990; DeGaetano et al., 1994; Henderson et al.,
1994). Karl ef al. found evidence of increases in extreme
seasonal minimum temperatures in the contiguous USA
and the former Soviet Union, but little or no change in
extreme seasonal maximum temperatures. Plummer (1996)
found that, in Australia, extreme minimum temperatures
have been increasing at a similar rate to average
temperatures but that trends in the extreme maximum
temperatures were smaller.

"There is some evidence of an increase in thunderstorms
in the global tropics, from observations of trends in
cloudiness (London et al., 1991). The amount of
cumulonimbus clouds, often associated with
thunderstorms, increased over the tropical oceans between
1952 and 1981 partly at the expense of cumulus clouds
(Section 3.3.8.2). This suggests an increase in
thunderstorm activity in the tropics. Increases in summer
extreme rainfall events in the USA reported by Karl et al.
(1995c), and in tropical Australia during summer (Suppiah
and Hennessey, 1995) also may reflect an increase in
thunderstorm activity. Overall, however, land based
tropical rainfall has declined in the last few decades (see
Figure 3.11). A large percentage of rainfall is associated
with thunderstorm activity, so the decrease in rainfall
might reflect a drop in thunderstorm activity, at least over
tropical land areas. Karl et al. (1995c) did not find
increases in summer extreme rainfall events in China or the

former Soviet Union.

IPCC (1990) provided a broad overview of the climates
of the past 5,000,000 years, and a more detailed
presentation of three periods suggested as possible
analogues of a greenhouse-enhanced world. IPCC (1992)
concentrated on the climate of the past 1000 years, a topic
which this chapter also examines, because of the recent
increase in data for this period, and because of its relevance
to the current climate. The data from the last 1000 years are
the most useful for determining the scales of natural
climate variability. Rapid natural climate changes also
provide information on the sensitivity/stability of the
climate system of relevance in projections of climate
change. Recent evidence of such changes over the last

Climates from before the recent instrumental era must be
deduced from palaeoclimatic records. These include tree
rings, pollen series, faunal and floral abundances in deep-
sea cores, isotope analysis from coral and ice cores, and
diaries and other documentary evidence. The difficulty of
determining past climates can be illustrated by the case of
tropical sea surface temperatures (SSTs) around the time of
the last glacial maximum (around 22,000-18,000 years
ago). The lack of consensus on this topic provides an
indication of the problems of using proxy data. The topic is
important partly because of the possible use of glacial data
in validating climate models, and relating past climates to
radiative forcings (Crowley, 1994). The relationship
between modern and past terrestrial and sea surface
temperatures is still one of the major uncertainties involved
in understanding the climate during the last ice age.
Terrestrial surface temperature estimates from snow line
and pollen data (e.g., Webster and Streten, 1978; Seltzer,
1992), SSTs from coral (e.g., Beck et al., 1992; Aharon et
al., 1994; Guilderson et ai., 1994), and from ice cores in

There are, for this last millennium, two periods which
have received special attention, the Medieval Warm Period
and the Little Ice Age. These have been interpreted, at
times, as periods of global warmth and coolness,
respectively. Recent studies have re-evaluated the interval
commonly known as the Medieval Warm Period to assess
the magnitude and geographical extent of any prolonged
warm interval between the 9th and 14th centuries (Hughes
"	Text
"and Diaz, 1994). The available evidence is limited
(geographically) and is equivocal. A number of records do
indeed show evidence for warmer conditions at some time
during this interval, especially in the 11th and 12th
centuries in parts of Europe, as pointed out by Lamb (1965,
1988). There are also indications of changes in
precipitation patterns and associated droughts both in
California and Patagonia during medieval time (Stine,
1994). However other records show no such evidence, or
indicate that warmer conditions prevailed, but at different
times. This rather incoherent picture may be due to an
inadequate number of records or a bias in the geographical
and seasonal representation in the available data (Briffa
and Jones, 1993; Jones and Briffa, 1996), and a clearer
picture may emerge as more and better calibrated proxy
records are produced. However, at this point, it is not yet
possible to say whether, on a hemispheric scale,
temperatures declined from the 11-12th to the 16-17th
century. Nor, therefore, is it possible to conclude that
global temperatures in the Medieval Warm Period were
comparable to the warm decades of the late 20th century.

"The term Little Ice Age is often used to describe a 400-
500 year long, globally synchronous cold interval, but
studies now show that the climate of the last few centuries
was more spatially and temporally complex than this
simple concept implies (Jones and Bradley, 1992). It was a
period of both warm and cold climatic anomalies that
varied in importance geographically. For the Northern
Hemisphere as a whole, the coldest intervals of summer
temperature were from 1570 to 1730 (especially 1600 to
1609) and during most of the 19th century, though
individual records show variations in this basic pattern.
Warmer conditions were more common in the early 16th
century and in most of the 18th century, though for the
entire hemisphere, conditions comparable to the decades
from 1920 onward (the time when instrumental records
become more reliable and widely available) have not been
experienced for at least several hundred years.
Temperatures from boreholes (Section 3.2.5.2) also suggest
that the present temperatures in parts of North America and
perhaps elsewhere may be warmer than the last few
hundred years. Regional temperatures do not all, of course,
conform to this pattern. For instance, spring temperatures
during the period 1720 to 1770 appeared to be warmer than
the 20th century in parts of China (Hameed and Gong,
1994). However, despite the spatial and temporal
complexity, it does appear that much of the world was
cooler in the few centuries prior to the present century.

Various methods based on historical, ice core, tree-ring,
lake level and coral data have been used to reconstruct the
climate of the last millennium (Cook, 1995). For example,
a significant number of annually resolved, precisely dated
temperature histories from tree rings are available.
However, these records are still too sparse to provide a
complete global analysis, and must, in general be
interpreted in a regional context. In addition, they usually
only reflect changes in warm-season (growing season)
temperatures. Tree-ring records frequently represent
interannual and decadal time-scale climate variability with
good fidelity, as indicated by comparison with recent
instrumental records. However, the extent to which multi-
decadal, century, and longer time-scale variability is
expressed can vary, depending on the length of individual
ring-width or ring-density series that make up the
chronologies, and the way in which these series have been
processed to remove non-climatic trends. In addition, the
possible confounding effects of carbon dioxide fertilisation
needs to be taken into account when calibrating tree-ring
data against climate variations. Coral records are available
from regions not represented by tree rings and usually have
annual resolution. However, none extends back more than
a few hundred years. The interpretation of ice core records
from polar ice sheets and tropical glaciers may be in some
cases limited by the noise inherent to snow depositional
processes, especially during this period when climate
changes were rather small (by comparison, for instance,
with the large rapid changes discussed in the next section).
On the other hand, they can give an unambiguous record of
accumulation change, on an annual basis. All these forms
of data can and have been used to provide information
regarding climate variations of the past 1000 years.

In the Southern Hemisphere, the records from
Australasia show evidence of recent unusual warmth,
especially since 1960, but some from South America do
not. Thus the Northern Patagonia and Rio Alerce ring-
width records from Argentina (Villalba, 1990; Boninsegna,
1992) and the Chilean Lenca ring-width temperature
history (Lara and Villalba, 1993) show no clear indication
of 20th century warming, in accord with local instrumental
records (Villalba, 1990). Recently analysed ice cores from
the north-central Andes (Thompson et al., 1995) indicate
that temperatures were cool in the 200-500 years before
the present. Strong warming has dominated the last two
centuries in this region. Temperatures in the last two
centuries appear higher than for some thousands of years in
this area. New Zealand tree rings reproduce the warming
observed instrumentally since about 1950, although there is

temperature record for 1607 to 1982 has been derived by
Dunbar ef al. (1994) who found a very high correlation

Coral-estimated SSTs have fallen significantly throughout
the 20th century in this location and may now be at their
lowest since 1650. This is in broad agreement with the lack
of recent warming in the South American tree-ring studies.
However, there has not been a general cooling in the
eastern tropical Pacific this century (Bottomley er al.,
1990), so the Galapagos cooling may be a local
phenomenon. Australian Great Barrier Reef temperature
histories since 1583 have been derived from corals
distributed along the reef from 10-30°S (Lough er al.,
1996). These coral-based SSTs have been relatively warm
for most of the 20th century. This warm period was
preceded by below-average SSTs in the 1850 to 1900
period. An earlier warm period is indicated around 1830 to
1840, but with less certainty. The pre-1800 period was

"from 16 palaeoclimatic records (Figure 3.20). Recent
decades (the recent instrumental record is also plotted on
this figure) appear to be warmer than any extended period
since 1400, and the warming since the late 19th century is
unprecedented in this record. Regionally, however, the
recent warming is not always exceptional. For instance, in
the Swedish Tornetrisk tree-ring series, the 20th century
warming appears as a relatively minor event (Briffa er al.,
1990; 1992). In this region, in both the 1400s and,
especially, the 900-1100 interval, summer conditions
appear to have been warmer than today. Tree-ring width
series from the northern Urals (Graybill and Shiyatov,
1992) indicate that in this area 20th century summers have
been somewhat warmer than average. A recent analysis,
using tree-ring density data, has attempted to reproduce
more of the century time-scale temperature variability in
this region (Briffa et al., 1995). This shows that the 20th
century was clearly the warmest in the last 1000 years in
this region, though shorter warmer periods occurred, for
example, in the 13th and 14th centuries. The Californian
Cirque Peak ring-width cool-season temperature history
(Graybill and Funkhouser, 1994) indicates unusual warmth
during most of the 20th century, but with recent cooling
(contrary to instrumental observations in this area). The
nearby Campito Mountain ring-width warm-season
temperature history (LaMarche, 1974) agrees well with the
Cirque Peak record, e.g., the 20th century appears to have
been unusually warm, while the 17th century was generally

"There is also firm evidence of rapid warm-cold
oscillations during the last glacial (Dansgaard-Oeschger

followed by periods of slower cooling and then a generally
rapid return to glacial conditions. About 20 such intervals
(interstadials) lasting between 500 and 2000 years occurred
during the last glacial period (Dansgaard et al., 1993).
Their general progression was similar to the rapid changes
in North Atlantic deep-sea core records. The most
prominent of these interstadials may be associated with the
sedimentary “Heinrich” layers interpreted as reflecting
massive iceberg discharge from Northern Hemisphere ice

change in the precipitation pattern (Alley er al., 1993) and
of rapid reorganisations in the atmospheric circulation
(Taylor et al., 1993a; Mayewski et al., 1993). Changes in
SST, associated with sudden changes in oceanic
circulation, also occurred in a few decades, at least in the
Norwegian Sea (~5°C in fewer than 40 years; Lehman and
Keigwin, 1992). During the last 20,000 years surface water
salinity and temperature have exhibited parallel changes
that resulted in reduced oceanic convection in the North
Atlantic and in reduced strength of the global conveyor belt
ocean circulation (Duplessy et al., 1992). There was also a
hiatus in the warming in the Southern Hemisphere during
the last deglaciation. The subsequent warming was much
less abrupt than in the Northern Hemisphere (Jouzel e¢ al.,
1995). Similar behaviour occurred in New Zealand
(Suggate, 1990; Denton and Hendy, 1994; Salinger, 1994).

The GRIP central Greenland ice core suggests that
climate instability may also have been present during the
last interglacial (Eemian). This period (~115,000-130,000
years ago) was locally warmer in Greenland than the
present climate by up to 4°C but may have been interrupted
by a series of changes that began extremely rapidly and
lasted from decades to centuries. Questions about the
validity of interpretation of the GRIP Eemian changes arise
because there are significant differences between the GRIP
and the GISP 2 records for the Eemian whereas the two
cores, only 28 km apart, are in excellent agreement
throughout the Holocene and the last glacial period. The
bottom 10% of each core contains deformational features
that are likely to have disturbed their stratigraphy (Taylor
et al., 1993b; Alley et al., 1995). Comparison of the
composition of entrapped air with the undisturbed
Antarctic air composition record shows that mixing of ice
of different origin has affected the bottom part of the GISP
2 core (Bender et al., 1994). Until such an approach has
been exploited for GRIP the possibility that disturbances
simply change the apparent timing of events within the
Eemian cannot be excluded for this core.

appear to have been warmer than any similar period of at

however, have been smaller and smoother than those

more relevant to the estimation of the possible speed of
natural climate variations in the current climate, because of
the closer similarity of boundary conditions (e.g.,
continental positions and ice sheets) to the current
situation. It seems unlikely, given the smaller regional
changes, that global mean temperatures have varied by 1°C

For example, changes in extreme events are not indicated

well-documented: the rather abrupt change in ENSO and
atmospheric circulation, around 1976/77, noted in IPCC
(1990). El Nifio episodes have been relatively frequent
since that time, with only rare excursions into La Nifia
episodes (e.g., 1988/89). There have been substantial
prolonged precipitation and circulation anomalies

Large and rapid climatic changes occurred during the
last ice age and during the transition towards the present
Holocene period. Some of those changes may have
occurred on time-scales of a few decades, at least in the
North Atlantic where they are best documented. They
affected atmospheric and oceanic circulation and
temperature, and the hydrologic cycle. There are
suggestions that similar rapid changes may have also
occurred during the last interglacial (the Eemian) period,
but this requires confirmation. The recent (20th century)
warming needs to be considered in the light of evidence
that rapid climatic changes can occur naturally in the
climate. However, temperatures have been far less variable
during the last 10,000 years (i.e., during the Holocene).

Conventional meteorological data, both now and in the
past, were collected for weather prediction and for the
description of the current climate. They require
considerable work to ensure that they are useful for
monitoring climate variability and change. Studies are
required to ensure that adequate corrections can be made
for changes in instrumentation, exposure, etc. The
reduction of such problems in the future, as well as the
past, will require the protection of high-quality climate

Probably no single climate element has been studied
more than near-surface temperature over land.
Unfortunately, the present rate of decline of global data
acquisition and exchange across the Global
Telecommunications System threatens estimates of near-
surface global temperature change (Karl ef al., 1995a).
Historical temperature data are plagued by inhomogeneities
from changes in instrumentation, exposure, site-changes,
and time-of-observation bias. Many of these problems can
be overcome by thorough comparisons between stations
and with the help of metadata (documentation regarding
site and instrumentation changes etc.). Few countries,
however, provide adequate support for such activities.
Changes in instrumentation in recent times continue to
pose problems. Karl ef al. (1995a) note, for instance, that
the introduction of a new maximum-minimum thermistor
in the USA co-operative observing network has introduced
a systematic bias. Oceanographic data suffer from a lack of
continuity. Conclusive detection and attribution of global
climate change will require an ongoing homogenous,
globally representative climate record. This needs to be
given high priority in the design and maintenance of
meteorological and oceanographic monitoring systems.

Climate model treatments of land processes have
advanced rapidly since the last assessment. However, there
are lags in the validation of these models, in the
development of required data sets, in an adequate
assessment of how sub-grid scale processes should be
represented, and in their implementation in models for
climate change projection. None of the land
parametrizations include a physically based and globally
validated treatment of runoff.

"Current climate models are highly sensitive to cloud
parametrizations, and there are not yet satisfactory means
for evaluating the correctness of such treatments. Progress
will require improved understanding, observational data
sets, sub-grid scale parametrization, and improved
modelling of the distribution of atmospheric water in its
vapour, liquid, and solid forms, and will not be achieved
quickly. Sub-grid scale parametrizations are especially
difficult to improve. The determination of cloud-dependent
surface radiative and precipitation fluxes is a significant
source of uncertainty for both land-surface and ocean

A large-scale dynamical framework for treating the ocean
component of climate models is now being used for climate
change projections. Sub-grid scale parametrizations in these
models are important for surface energy exchange and the
thermohaline circulation. A new parametrization for interior
mixing appears promising in providing an improved
simulation of the global thermocline. Both high latitude and
tropical elements of ocean climate models involve important
and still inadequately represented processes. In high
latitudes, coupling to sea ice models and deep convection are
especially important. In the tropics, ocean models need to
simulate the large-scale sea surface temperature variability
of the El Nifio-Southern Oscillation systems.

"This chapter assesses the processes in the climate system
that are believed to contribute the most to the uncertainties
in current projections of greenhouse warming. Many of
these processes involve the coupling of the atmosphere,
ocean, and land through the hydrological cycle. Continued
progress in climate modelling will depend on the
development of comprehensive data sets and their
application to improving important parametrizations. The
large-scale dynamical and thermodynamical processes in
atmospheric and oceanic models are well treated and are
one of the strengths of the modelling approach. As
previously indicated in IPCC (1990, 1992), the radiative
effects of clouds and their linkages to the hydrological
cycle remain a major uncertainty for climate modelling.
The present report, however, goes into much more detail
than the past reports in summarising the many facets of this
question, recent progress in understanding different
feedbacks, and in the development of climate model
parametrization treating these processes. This is now a very
active research area with much that has been accomplished
since IPCC (1990).

Another current focus for climate process studies is the
evolving interpretation of the past climate record. Most
notable is that of the observed warming of about half a
degree over the last century. This is about a factor of two
smaller than conventional estimates according to models
including only trace gas increases but is consistent with the
inclusion of the expected effects of sulphate aerosols.

"A globally averaged temperature increase is the response
most easily related to global greenhouse forcing. Current
climate models project global temperature increases that
vary by over a factor of two to three for a given forcing
scenario. These differences are directly attributable to the
treatment of cloud processes, their links to the hydrological
cycle and their interaction with radiation in the models.
Indeed, individual models can give this range of answers,
depending on changes only in the cloud parametrization
(Senior and Mitchell, 1993). Thus, all the likely
contributors to the ultimate representations of cloud
processes in climate models need emphasis, as do other
aspects of the hydrological cycle and model dynamics that
interact with cloud evolution and properties.

 
"	Text
"Land-surface processes are also now highlighted for
several reasons. The land surface is readily modified on the
large-scale by human activities. Such modifications may
have important regional consequences: historical land
modifications may have had larger regional climate impacts
up to now than has had greenhouse gas warming. Land-
surface processes probably are of lesser importance for the
future globally averaged temperature response to greenhouse
warming than are cloud processes, but how climate changes
over land is of the greatest practical importance to humans
and depends substantially on land-surface processes.
Furthermore, land-surface processes strongly affect the
overlying atmospheric hydrological cycle including clouds,
so they arguably will be of major importance as feedbacks
for determining changes in regional climate patterns.

"that the observed global trends and continental
predominance of night-time warming can be explained if
clouds and aerosol have increased over continental surfaces
with a global average radiative cooling of about half that of
the warming by greenhouse gases increase. For the same
direct radiative effects, a cloud increase would have a
larger impact on diurnal range than would dry aerosols,
since clouds not only cool during daytime but warm the
surface at night. GCM calculations by Mitchell e¢ al.
(1995) indicate that the direct radiative effect of aerosols
alone can only partially explain the observed decrease in
diurnal range. Further progress will require understanding
the time history and distribution of anthropogenic aerosol
as well as its effects on cloud properties and its consequent
direct and indirect radiative effects.

"As mentioned above, ocean surface temperatures, and
hence much of climate variability and change are strongly
influenced by net energy exchanges between the oceans and
the atmosphere. In high latitudes, sea ice is of major
significance for modifying these energy exchanges. The
possible rapid variations of the thermohaline circulation, first
suggested by Bryan (1986), indicate that rearrangements of
heat in the ocean can occur relatively quickly so that surface
temperatures can respond rapidly to changes in the
thermohaline circulation. Further, the thermohaline
circulation is particularly sensitive to changes in the high
latitude temperature and hydrology; variability on decadal-
to-millennial time-scales can arise. On somewhat shorter
time-scales, coupled atmosphere-ocean processes in the
tropics are a major source of interannual climate variability.
Therefore, dynamically active oceans are included in
coupled models for a comprehensive evaluation of the
response to increases in the radiatively active gases.

Climate processes are all the individual physical processes
that separately contribute to the overall behaviour of the
climate system. They are also the interactions and feedbacks
among the individual processes that determine the response
of the climate system to external forcing, including the
response to global anthropogenic forcing. There are a myriad
of such climate processes. This report is focused by the
present community experience with numerical modelling.
The success of numerical simulations of future climate
change hinges on the adequate inclusion of all the climate
processes that are responsible for determining the behaviour
of the system. A triage approach is used here; processes are
treated lightly that are already included adequately in
numerical models or those for which there is little or no
evidence supporting their importance. The present report
emphasises those processes known to contribute
substantially to the uncertainties of current numerical
simulations of long-term climate response. These all are
physical processes. Chemical and biological components are
treated in Chapters 2, 9 and 10 respectively, and at present
would be de-emphasised by the triage approach for lack of
substantial effort to include them in climate models.

Changes in the vertical decrease of temperature with
altitude change surface temperature for a given radiative
balance and are known as “lapse rate feedback”. Changes
in lapse rate act as an additional feedback that can also be
substantial and that generally oppose the water vapour
feedback. The sum of the water vapour and lapse rate
feedbacks comprise the clear-sky feedback. Cess et al.
(1990) show that the magnitude of the clear-sky feedback
is very similar in a wide range of models. However, the
partitioning between lapse rate and water vapour feedback
may vary substantially between models (Zhang et al.,
1994) depending on how convection is parametrized and
may depend on the time-scale of the climate change or
climate fluctuations considered (Bony ef al., 1995).

A positive water vapour feedback was hypothesised in the
earliest simulations of global warming with simple
radiative-convective models (Manabe and Wetherald,
1967). It arises for water vapour near the surface from the
strong dependence of the saturation vapour pressure on
temperature, as given by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation.
Increases in temperature are thus expected to lead to
increases in the atmospheric water vapour mixing ratio.
Since water vapour is the most important greenhouse gas,
such increases in water vapour enhance the greenhouse
effect; that is, they reduce the thermal infrared (long-wave)
flux leaving the atmosphere-surface system, providing a
positive feedback amplifying the initial warming. This
feedback operates in all the climate models used in global

"How upper tropospheric water vapour is distributed and

upper tropospheric water vapour to clear-sky long-wave
radiation and to moist convection indicated by the
International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP),
over a five-year period. These are shown to be highly
correlated in the tropical half of the world but uncorrelated
outside the tropics. Thus, these data support the
conventional view that in the tropics, water vapour is
supplied to the upper troposphere primarily by moist
convection. They find that this result is maintained, even
averaging over the whole tropical belt of 30°S-30°N, and
so conclude that the net effect of convection is moistening
even allowing for compensating regions of subsidence.
Chou (1995) in a case study with two months of data

most models, the amounts of high cloud to increase. This
increase (which depends on the somewhat uncertain
changes of water vapour and relative humidity) enhances
the greenhouse effect and produces a positive feedback
(e.g., Wetherald and Manabe, 1988; Mitchell and Ingram,

observationally, In the extra-tropics, the relative
contributions to upper tropospheric water vapour of lateral
transport from the tropics, versus upward transport by
large-scale motions or by moist convection are poorly

vapour feedback was almost as strong at middle and high
latitudes as it was at low latitudes. Pierrehumbert and Yang

complexity of latitudinal exchanges of water vapour by
large-scale eddies at high latitudes, and Kelly et al. (1991)

"The first cloud feedback to be studied in detail in global
models involves changes in cloud amounts. These can be
extremely complicated because of the many different types
of clouds, whose properties and coverage are controlled by
many different physical processes, and which affect the
radiation budget in many different ways. In the global and
annual mean, clouds have a cooling effect on the present
climate (the surface and atmosphere), as evaluated from the
Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) and other
satellite measurements. That is, the 31 Wm? enhancement
of the thermal greenhouse effect is exceeded by a 48 Wm?
increase in the reflection of short-wave radiation to space
(Ramanathan ef al., 1989). But there are large variations in
the net cloud forcing with geography and cloud type;
indeed some clouds contribute a net warming. For low
clouds, the reflected short-wave dominates so that an
increase in amount would cool the climate and be a
negative feedback on global warming. But thin tropical
cirrus clouds are much colder than the underlying surface
and act more to enhance the greenhouse effect, so an
increase in the amount of this cloud type would be a
positive feedback.

Randall, 1980; Klein and Hartmann, 1993) as, for example,
when a subsidence inversion associated with a subtropical
high pressure cell confines moisture evaporated from the

the radiative cooling associated with the clouds helps to
maintain such inversions by lowering the temperature of
the cloudy air. Turbulent entrainment, driven in part by
radiative destabilisation, also maintains the inversion.

High clouds are very effective in trapping outgoing long-
wave radiation, and so tend to warm the Earth. The net
radiative effect on climate of anvils and cirrus clouds
associated with deep convection in the tropics is near zero
(e.g., Ramanathan et al., 1989) because short-wave cooling
and long-wave warming nearly cancel each other. The
solar cooling acts mainly at the Earth’s surface; however,
how much is absorbed rather than reflected by clouds is
currently controversial, as discussed in Section 4.2.6.
Long-wave warming by anvils and cirrus clouds associated
with deep convection in the tropics acts mainly on the
atmosphere and can influence the general circulation of the
atmosphere (Slingo and Slingo, 1988; Harshvardhan e al.,

The positive feedback maintaining low clouds may be
suppressed by various dynamical processes. Mesoscale
circulations are forced in the marine boundary layer by the
strong cloud-top radiative cooling that, in turn, breaks
stratiform clouds into mesoscale cloud patches (Shao and
Randall, 1996). Such broken clouds allow more solar
radiation to warm the sea surface. Furthermore,
temperature, moisture, and the subsidence rate of the
subsiding air above the inversion may be changed to
weaken the inversion (Siems ef al., 1990), thus increasing
the likelihood of the stratiform clouds breaking up
(Deardorff, 1980; Randall, 1980). Still controversial are
details of the criteria and relative importance of other
mechanisms, such as drizzle, absorbed sunlight, and
entrainment decoupling that might detach planetary

Recent work has led to simple ice crystal scattering
parametrizations for climate models (Ebert and Curry,

climate models develop the capability to compute crystal
sizes and realistic distributions of the ice water path.
Comparison of cirrus properties from ISCCP with those
generated by GCM parametrization using observed large-
scale dynamic and thermodynamic fields from operational
analyses shows encouraging agreement in the spatial
patterns of the cirrus optical depths (Soden and Donner,

In climate change studies with the UK Meteorological

that in a warmer atmosphere, water clouds (lasting longer
because of slower fall rates) replace ice clouds in the mixed
phase region and hence cloud amount, especially at low

feedback led to larger cloud amounts and to an increased
short-wave cloud cooling with a warming climate.
Consequently climate sensitivity was reduced with a 2.8°C
warming in response to a doubling of CO,, in comparison
with an older relative humidity dependent cloud scheme
where the global mean warming was 5.4°C. The inclusion
of interactive cloud radiative properties further reduced the
global mean warming to 1.9°C. In regions where cloud
amount increased, the optical depth also increased. The net
cloud feedback in this experiment was negative.

suggested. Cloud drops are formed by condensation on
submicron diameter hygroscopic aerosol particles, which
are present throughout the troposphere. The concentrations
of CCN are highly variable and are influenced by air
pollution as well as by natural processes as addressed in
Chapters 3 and 4 of IPCC (1994) and Sections 2.3 and 2.4
of this report. The number of nuclei available has a strong
effect on the number of cloud particles formed, and this in
turn affects both the cloud optical properties and the
likelihood of precipitation. Changes in the CCN
concentration might alter the number of cloud drops that
can grow, and hence alter the mean radius for a given
liquid-water path. Some parametrization are attempting to
represent the effects of nuclei availability on cloud particle

number density and cloud particle size.

The crude nature of current parametrization of
detrainment of cumulus ice and the sensitivity to this term as
discussed above, suggest that this may be an important area
for future work in cloud parametrization. Low-level clouds
may not produce the large negative feedback that is
characteristic of models with only temperature-dependent
cloud water because increasing cloud water content in a
warmer climate could be offset by a decreasing geometric
thickness of these clouds. This is consistent with the
behaviour of satellite-derived optical thickness in the ISCCP
data set (Tselioudis et ai., 1992). Thus the sign of the cloud
liquid-water feedback in the real climate system is still
unknown. Further study will be needed to reach the goal to
determine the overall sign and magnitude of the real world’s
cloud feedback, as cloud feedback varies considerably with
cloud type and geography and presumably with time.
Nevertheless, the results from the new models provide
valuable new insight into the physical issues that must be
confronted before this goal can be achieved.

feedback vary considerably between the models. In addition,
several modelling centres have produced a wide range of
cloud feedbacks from slightly different cloud

the uncertainty of the magnitude of the cloud feedback. The

To support their idea, Ramanathan and Collins presented
observational evidence that SST fluctuations associated
with El Nifio are accompanied by changes in the solar
cloud radiative forcing (CRF) that would tend to dampen
the SST fluctuations regionally. Where the ocean warms,
the solar radiation reaching the sea surface diminishes, and
where the ocean cools, the increased solar radiation tends
to warm it. Ramanathan and Collins argued that convection
and high bright clouds increase when the SST increases to
about 30°C. They suggested that the increased solar cloud
forcing associated with deep convection might act to
prevent much higher SSTs.

"Clouds are sensitive to the changes of both atmospheric

changes in the surface boundary layer can cause substantial

circulation can modify atmospheric conditional instability
and thus clouds, even without a change at the surface (Lau

future cloud changes depends on the correctness of these

Consideration of ocean surface-atmosphere interactions
have led to a controversial hypothesis. Figure 4.4
schematically illustrates what is known as the Thermostat
Hypothesis (Ramanathan and Collins, 1991). If a positive
SST perturbation leads to an increase in surface
evaporation and moisture convergence (Lindzen and
Nigam, 1987) then the increased moisture supply induces
more convection, which leads to the formation of more
high, bright clouds, which reflect more solar energy back
to space. The resulting reduction in the solar radiation
absorbed at the sea surface thus acts to dampen the
postulated positive SST perturbation. The initial
perturbation might be the climatological differences
between east and west Pacific, or warming of the east
Pacific associated with El Niiio, or overall SST increases
associated with greenhouse warming. Similar mechanisms
would not necessarily apply to all these situations.

also for under-emphasising the tendency of surface

A global enhancement of the magnitude proposed by
Ramanathan is in conflict with many other documented
studies with research aircraft where the measured
absorption was not substantially different from the
theoretically predicted value (Stephens and Tsay, 1990).
Additionally, a critical examination of the anomalous
absorption papers has revealed major flaws in the analysis
methods which appear to invalidate the conclusions
(Stephens, 1995). Hayasaka et al. (1995) have concluded
“that the anomalous absorption pointed out by aircraft
observations in previous studies does not exist”. An
extensive survey of surface and satellite data (Li et al.,
1995a; Whitlock et al., 1995) suggests that short-wave
budgets are unlikely to be in error by more than 15 Wm.
Li et al. (1995b) carried out extensive analyses of data
“following the same methodologies” as Cess et al. and
Ramanathan et al. They do not find anomalous absorption
except possibly in the tropics where the data are most
uncertain. The disagreement with Cess et al. is attributed to
the use of different data sets, not due to different
methodoiogies. Thus, at present, the evidence is weak for
the claim that clouds absorb substantially more short-wave
radiation than is predicted by models.

Three recent papers argue that clouds absorb much more
solar radiation than current physical understanding and
radiation codes would allow. Suggestions that some clouds
absorb more short-wave radiation than can be accounted
for on the basis of the known radiative properties of water
and ice have appeared at various times in the literature over
several decades (see the review by Stephens and Tsay,
1990). This possibility has been invoked by Ramanathan er
al. (1995), in the context of the West Pacific warm pool.
According to their results, the effect of clouds on short-
wave radiation at the surface needs to be 50% more than
that at the top of the atmosphere, whereas current radiation
schemes predict an enhancement of less than 20%. The
implication is that the clouds are absorbing several times
more short-wave radiation than previously believed.
Ramanathan er al. do accept that, by making “extreme (but
plausible)” changes to their numbers, it is possible to close
the heat budget without recourse to anomalous absorption.
However, the companion paper by Cess et al. (1995)
claims that the anomalous absorption is a global
phenomenon, showing evidence from a wide variety of
locations to support the 50% enhancement required by
Ramanathan et al. This enhancement was also obtained by
Pilewskie and Valero (1995) in an analysis of observations
from research aircraft in the tropics.

produced during this convective overturning, and a
substantial fraction of the cloudiness in the tropics is
produced by cumulus convection, either directly in the
cumulus clouds themselves, or indirectly in the cirrus and

even be transformed into a heating. The convectively

Cumulus convection is a manifestation of a buoyancy-
driven instability that occurs when the vertical decrease of
temperature is sufficiently rapid (ie., when the “lapse rate”
of temperature is sufficiently strong) and, at the same time,
sufficient moisture is available. Because of the latter
condition, cumulus instability is often called “conditional
instability”. The degree to which buoyancy forces can
drive cumulus convection thus depends on both the lapse
rate and the humidity. The time-scale for convective
release is on the order of an hour ~ very short, compared to
the multi-day time-scale of large-scale weather systems.
This disparity of time-scales implies that ensembles of
cumulus clouds must stay nearly in balance with large-
scale weather systems. If a large-scale motion system or
surface heating tries to promote cumulus instability,
convection releases the instability restoring the system to a
near-neutral state almost as rapidly as the instability is
generated.

“Large-scale precipitation” refers to a somewhat old-
fashioned but still widely used parametrization forming
stratiform clouds such as cirrus or stratus and the
accompanying precipitation that occurs when the mean
state relative humidity reaches or tries to exceed a
threshold value, such as 100%. Although generally larger
than cumulus clouds, these systems are still typically sub-
grid scale in climate models. Some such schemes
accordingly include a sub-grid scale distribution of
humidities, so that precipitation occurs with mean state
relative humidities <100%. Relative humidities exceeding
the threshold can be produced, for example, by large-scale
rising motion which leads to adiabatic cooling and a
decrease of the saturation mixing ratio. The excess
humidity is typically assumed to condense and fall out as
precipitation. In prognostic schemes, it may also be stored
as liquid water. In many models, the falling precipitation is
permitted to evaporate or partially evaporate on the way
down.

The first atmosphere-ocean coupled models studying
greenhouse warming concentrated on the sensitivity and

radiatively active gases by using well-mixed (slab) oceans
of fixed depth with no (or specified) transport of thermal
energy. While such simplifications are useful for
understanding atmospheric responses and for qualitative
estimates of certain ocean responses, work over the last
few years has indicated that the ocean circulation itself is
sensitive to changes in forcing at the surface. Thus as the
radiatively active gases increase, the ocean circulation may
change and these changes may affect the mean climate and
its variability. These changes may be significant, so that
only coupled models that include the relevant parts of the

atmosphere through its surface quantities occurs through:
SST, sea ice extent and thickness, surface albedo over ice-
covered and ice-free regions, sea surface salinity and the
partial pressure of CO, at the surface (pCO,). It is a major
component of the climate system in determining the mean
(annually averaged) climate, the annual variations of
climate, and climate variations on time-scales as long as

that the atmosphere and land can be affected, these surface
variations, in turn, depend on the thermal and saline
coupling between the deeper ocean and the surface. Thus,
the thermal and saline structure and variations in the deeper
ocean must be simulated in order to determine surface
variations on Jong time-scales. In general (except in those
few regions of deep convection and other water mass
transformation regions), the longer the time-scale of
interest, the greater the depth of ocean that communicates
with the surface. In turn, the ocean is driven by fluxes from

their absence. Improved treatments are vigorously
being pursued.

The cloud feedback processes are intimately linked
to the atmospheric hydrological cycle, and can only
be simulated satisfactorily if there is a
comprehensive treatment of water in all its phases —
vapour, liquid and ice. Many of these cloud and
linked hydrological processes occur on scales not
resolved by current GCMs. The sub-grid scale
parametrizations treating these processes should be
physically based and carefully evaluated with
observational data.

Inadequate simulation of cloud amounts and optical
properties in GCMs contributes major errors to the
simulation of surface net radiation, and thereby
introduces errors in simulation of regional ocean and
land temperatures. Uncertainties in the simulation of
changes in these properties with climate change have
a major impact on confidence in projections of future
regional climate change.

There is an important, but poorly understood, linkage
of cloud optical properties to the CCN distribution.
Inclusion of this linkage for models of climate
change will require an improved description of the

microphysical treatments of cloud droplet size
distributions.

There is a consensus among different GCMs as to the

deep sinking exists. These processes and the thermohaline
circulation may change on various time-scales.

Given the surface fluxes and a formulation of mixed-layer
processes near the surface, ocean general circulation
models have to solve the advective equations for
temperature and salt in the presence of convective
overturning and stable ocean mixing. Convection arises
when the density stratification becomes unstable and when
relatively salty water is cooled to low temperature and
becomes so dense that a water column becomes unstable.
Convection homogenises the column and allows
overturning to occur (see Killworth (1983) for a complete
review).

Convection occurs over scales of a few km and is

Detailed simulations of individual convective elements in
neutral stratification show the process to be complex and
rife with small-scale features (Jones and Marshall, 1993;
Legg and Marshall, 1993). Nevertheless, it is important to
represent this process in ocean models with resolution
coarser than the scales on which convection is known to

Ocean only models are useful for isolating the ocean
processes that may be present in more comprehensive
coupled models of the climate although such may be
considerably altered when coupled to the atmosphere. The
idea that the stability and variability of the thermohaline
circulation depends on the relative strength of high latitude
thermal to fresh water forcing was introduced in coarse
resolution ocean GCMs by Weaver et al. (1991, 1993). A
steady thermohaline circulation can only exist if the fresh
water input by high latitude precipitation, runoff, and ice
melt is balanced by the fresh water export by that same
thermohaline circulation. As the high latitude fresh water
flux is increased, the ability of the thermohaline circulation
to remove the fresh water is limited and the thermohaline
circulation may have multiple equilibrium solutions
(Stommel, 1961; Bryan 1986; Marotzke, 1988) and large
variability. Such variability on decadal (Weaver and
Sarachik, 1991) to millennial (Winton and Sarachik, 1993,
Winton, 1993) time-scales has been demonstrated in ocean
models with relatively large fresh water stochastic forcing.
While the imposed boundary conditions on temperature
have come into question, the mechanism is physically
plausible and may survive the transition to a responsive
atmosphere. If so, the implications are considerable: in a
warmer world with warmer high latitudes and a stronger
hydrologic cycle the thermohaline circulation could
become less stable and more variable.

The largest surface air temperature increase with
greenhouse warming is expected in the high latitudes of the
Northern Hemisphere, because of the large atmospheric
stability and the positive feedbacks between sea ice albedo
and the surface temperature of the mixed ocean layer.
These feedbacks are inadequately characterised, in part
because of uncertain cloud feedbacks at the ice margins.
Climate models that do not account for open waters over
the ice-covered ocean probably overestimate the effect of
the sea ice albedo in summer and underestimate the ocean
cooling in winter. Changing snow cover may also feed
back on ice thickness (Ledley, 1993).

depend on a detailed knowledge of the precise mechanisms
of that mixing. Mesoscale eddies, for example, are plentiful
in the ocean and their finer scales would imply enhanced

temperature and tracers. A recent parametrization (Gent
and McWilliams, 1990; Danabasoglu et al., 1994) of these
eddies follows an approach pioneered in stratospheric

accomplished by advection by the “residual circulation”

Parametrization of the mixing of stably stratified water in
the interior of the ocean is crucial for the simulation of ocean
circulation. Traditionally, eddy mixing coefficients have
been used with values of order 1cm?/s for vertical diffusion
and viscosity and order10’em2/s for horizontal diffusion.
These diffusion values are sometimes derived from tracer
experiments, but more often they are selected to ensure
numerical stability of the simulation. Parcels tend to stay and
move on surfaces of constant density, which are
predominantly horizontal in the interior ocean, and only
small values of cross-density diffusion are expected. A tracer
experiment (Ledwell e7 ai., 1993) has recently indicated that
the correct vertical diffusion coefficient for the ocean
interior is closer to 0.1 cm?/s, an order of magnitude smaller
than often used. Vertical mixing in the regions of lateral
boundary currents or perhaps sea mounts is likely to be
larger. Large et al. (1995) review a new scheme for mixed-

contrasts with the ocean-only simulations: an eastern

inadequacy of stratus cloud simulations in the atmospheric
component of the coupled model (Koberle and Philander,
1994). To the extent that tropical Pacific temperatures
matter for global climate and to the extent that ENSO
variability dominates SST and land temperatures in the
tropics (Wallace, 1995), it is clear that ENSO must be
considered a vital part of the global climate system and
should be accurately simulated. In order to correctly
simulate ENSO, the meridional resolution at the equator
must be a fraction of a degree in order to simulate wave
processes and the meridional extent of the upwelling, both

"Climate Processes

The large-scale dynamics of current ocean models
seem reasonably realistic, but are not completely
validated, in part because of a dearth of appropriate
observations. An outstanding question to be resolved
is the response of the thermohaline circulation in
coupled models to increased high latitude inputs of
fresh water. This question needs to be answered to
assess how latitudinal gradients of SST may respond
to global warming. Current suggestions point to
either a large increase in or a highly variable
latitudinal temperature gradient as possible
responses.

Fluxes at the ocean-atmosphere interface in coupled
models have not yet been fully examined. In some
cases there may be serious errors — for example,
surface radiative fluxes depending on inadequately
parametrized cloud processes, and high latitude inputs
of fresh water depending on poorly characterised
changes in the atmosphere-hydrological cycle.

Oceanic models still use relatively crude
parametrizations of sub-grid scale processes for near
surface and interior mixing and for deep convection.
New parametrizations for interior mixing associated
with mesoscale eddies are likely to improve the
simulated depth and sharpness of the global
thermocline.

Details of sea ice treatments in GCMs are still
questionable, although some improvements are being
examined. The role of sea ice in climate change is
especially uncertain because of poorly known
interface feedbacks; that is, overlying clouds
modifying radiation, surface wind stress, ocean
currents and changes in oceanic heat transport
underneath the sea ice.

ENSO processes have major effects on the tropical
climate system, with a strong impact on hydrological
processes and surface temperatures on interannual
time-scales. Some coupled atmosphere-ocean models

Heterogeneity is manifested in the precipitation and radiative
inputs and in modelling the land processes themselves. The
issue of precipitation heterogeneity (Milly and Eagleson,

in several GCMs, as reviewed by Thomas and Henderson-

surface cover (Avissar and Pielke, 1989; Seth et al., 1994)

three scales need to be considered. On a very fine scale,
canopy air interacts between different surfaces, and surface
roughness lengths cannot be associated with individual
surfaces. Koster and Suarez (1992) refer to this scale of
heterogeneity as “mixture” and for a given roughness give
a simple model for deriving a total canopy temperature and
water vapour from individual elements. This type of
heterogeneity needs to be provided as part of the overall

Shuttleworth (1988) refers to these as “ordered”

convection in ways not accounted for by grid box-mean

"Some aspects of heterogeneity can be treated with
relatively straightforward approaches including how to
determine an average over a wide range of surface types
with different characteristics. Raupach and Finnigan (1995)
have considered energetic constraints on areally averaged
energy balances in heterogeneous regions. In some cases,
particularly if surface characteristics do not differ strongly,
surface parameters can be aggregated (Claussen, 1990;
Blyth et al., 1993). For instance, albedo can simply be
linearly averaged, (when the underlying surface is
otherwise fairly homogeneous) whereas for roughness
length a more complex aggregation is necessary (Taylor,
1987; Mason, 1988; Claussen, , 1990).

Another issue of heterogeneity is in the distribution of
incident radiation. Sub-grid scale clouds, perhaps
associated with precipitation, may be important. For
example, if precipitation occurs over some fraction of a
grid square and spatial variation of surface wetness is
included, but radiation is assumed homogeneous, the
estimated evaporation from the wet surfaces will be
excessive. Besides clouds, surface slope can be a major
cause of heterogeneity in the amounts of absorbed surface
solar radiation (Avissar and Pielke, 1989), as well as
determining further heterogeneities in clouds and
precipitation. Barros and Lettenmaier (1994) review the
role of orography in triggering clouds and precipitation.

Processes at the land surface influence the atmosphere
through fluxes of heat and moisture into the PBL. These in
turn affect atmospheric stability and the occurrence of
precipitation and cloud radiative effects. Betts et al. (1993,
1994) have shown a close coupling between errors in a
model’s surface parametrization and its PBL, clouds, and
moist convection. Sensitivity studies with GCMs have
looked at the question of the possible effect of land cover
modifications. These studies have indicated major surface
influences on the atmospheric hydrological processes. This

Consequently, a regional surface flux is obtained by a
linear average. Flux and parameter aggregation may be
combined or use can be made of the intermediate approach
of averaging exchange coefficients (Mahrt, 1987). The
various aggregation methods require specification of a
“blending height” where the aggregated information is
matched to the overlying GCM grid squares (Claussen,
1990, 1991; Wood and Mason, 1991; Dolman, 1992; Blyth
et al., 1993). For ordered heterogeneity, this concept is less
useful since the blending height would be above the
surface layer. Practical application of these averaging
procedures to global models will require high resolution
global data sets on vegetation properties from future
satellite sensors.

"The calculation of regional surface fluxes is made
difficult by the non-linear dependence between fluxes and
driving mean gradients. For example, where parts of the
area are snow-covered with surface temperatures held at
the freezing point, the mean vertical temperature structure
over the area may imply a downward heat flux but, because
the transfer coefficients are larger in the snowfree,
statically unstable part of the area, the actual mean heat
flux can be upward. Moreover, if surface types strongly
differ, “parameter aggregation” becomes unfeasible. For
example, definition of an aggregated soil temperature
diffusivity does not make sense if parts of the area consist
of bare soil, where heat conduction is diffusive, and of
open water, where heat can be advected horizontally as
well as vertically. In these more complex landscapes, “flux
aggregation” is preferred (Avissar and Pielke, 1989;
Claussen, 1991). Flux aggregation implies the computation

"The aggregation or averaging methods may effectively
treat the prescribed distribution of surface heterogeneities,
but are not readily generalised to the dynamic interactions

radiation. Alternatively, a model grid box can be
subdivided into sub-elements with both distinct surface
characteristics and distinct atmospheric inputs. The “tile”
or “mosaic” scheme by Koster and Suarez (1992)
emphasises representation of the land heterogeneity.
Different approaches may be needed to efficiently treat the
heterogeneous distribution of atmospheric inputs; these
atmospheric inputs may provide the largest overall
departure in results from that inferred for homogeneous
conditions. The possible importance of mesoscale
circulation effects as a function of the spatial scale of
individual homogeneous element on surface and boundary

The sum of various regional climate changes from land-
use may contribute an overall effect on global climate.
Estimates of global radiative forcing depending on albedo
change are usually small compared to energy flux change
from greenhouse gases. However, effects of changing land
surface on the ratio of sensible to latent fluxes and on
precipitation are not accounted for in such estimates and
may be significant not only regionally but globally.

Recent studies of the sensitivity of the Amazon Basin
climate to a change from forest to grassland have been
published, e.g., by Nobre et al. (1991), Henderson-Sellers
et al. (1993) and Lean and Rowntree (1993). The response
of climate to deforestation in the Amazon has been found
to be sensitive to the specification of surface properties
such as albedo (Dirmeyer and Shukla, 1994) and surface
roughness (Sud et ail., 1995). A contrasting question is the
effect of changing a semi-arid grassland such as the Sahel
in Africa to a desert (e.g., Xue and Shukla, 1993).
Reductions in absorbed solar energy due to higher surface
albedos reduce ET but it is not clear how the change in
precipitation should be related to change in ET. Many of
the simulations have shown precipitation to reduce
substantially more than ET, which implies a reduction in

the convergence of moisture from the ocean.

"Land processes, driven by incoming solar radiation
and precipitation, play an important role in the
determination of near-surface climate, surface
temperature, soil moisture, etc., and hence regional
climates. Biases and uncertainties in the surface
energy balance, and radiation and water budgets, are
a significant source of error in simulations of
regional climate.

Detailed treatments of land processes are now
available, replacing the previously used bucket
models, and are being incorporated into numerous
climate models. These treatments are substantial
conceptual improvements, but it is premature to
judge how they will modify or improve our
confidence in climate change simulations. A number
of issues must be resolved before their inclusion in
climate models may be viewed as satisfactory. These

¢ Modelling of runoff has large uncertainty in global

scaling of the responsible processes over the many
orders of magnitude involved, and in high latitudes
of the effects of frozen soils. Global data on soils,
topography, and water holding capacities at the

progress on this issue.

* The question of the averaging of heterogeneous land
surfaces has been clarified and reasonable

how land-surface characteristics might change with
climate and CO, change and how important that is as
a feedback. Sensitivity studies of the impact of
doubling stomatal resistance indicates some climatic
effects over forest regions comparable to those
anticipated from global warming over the next
century. How the integrated stomatal resistance for
global vegetation might change with changing
climate and CO, concentrations is largely unknown.

Land-surface processes can be modelled more
realistically than in 1990, although there continues to
be wide disparity among current schemes. The
evaluation of surface parametrizations such as soil
moisture continues to be hindered by the lack of
observations.

Ocean and sea ice models portray the observed large-

more accurately than in 1990. High resolution ocean
models simulate mesoscale ocean eddies with
striking realism, but their computational cost is

The most powerful tools available with which to
assess future climate are coupled climate models,
which include three-dimensional representations of
the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and land surface.
Coupled climate modelling has developed rapidly
since 1990, and current models are now able to
simulate many aspects of the observed climate with a
useful level of skill. Coupled model simulations are
most accurate at large space scales (e.g., hemispheric
or continental); at regional scales skill is lower. The
extent to which differences among coupled models
may result in differences in their simulations of
climate change is, however, not yet fully understood.
More detailed and accurate simulations are expected
as models are further developed and improved.

The evaluation of coupled climate models is a
challenging task for which a suitable formalism is
only now being developed. Considerable progress
has been made in evaluating the performance of the
component atmospheric, oceanic, land-surface and
sea ice models and their interactions.

Flux adjustment and spin-up methodologies commonly
used in coupled models affect the simulation of surface
temperature, sea ice cover and the strength of the
thermohaline circulation. The need for flux adjustment
is expected to diminish as the component atmospheric,
oceanic, land-surface and sea ice models are improved.

of the atmospheric, oceanic, land-surface and sea ice model
components (Sections 5.3 and 5.4), and evaluation of the
sensitivity of the links between these components (Section
5.5). There has been significant progress in all three types
of model evaluation since [IPCC (1990).

"As discussed in Chapter 1, the coupled climate system
comprises the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and land
surface, and the models we consider here are “full” models
in that they include the three-dimensional representation
and interaction of these components on a global time-
dependent basis. Such coupled models, in which other
aspects of the climate system such as the chemical
composition of the atmosphere and the surface vegetation
are specified, provide the current scientific basis for
understanding and simulating the climate system and its
future changes. We note that none of the control
simulations considered in this section include the direct
effects of aerosols (see Chapter 6).

"The concept of evaluation used here corresponds to the
ideas of Oreskes er al. (1994) in that we are trying to
demonstrate the degree of correspondence between models
and the real world they seek to represent. We will therefore
avoid use of the word “validation”, although this term is
commonly used in the sense of evaluation in the climate
modelling community. The intent of this chapter is to
summarise the performance of models as used for the
simulation of the current observed climate, and to point out
deficiencies and uncertainties with a view to further model
improvement. The models’ behaviour near the surface is
stressed since surface and near-surface variables arc those
of greatest human interest and socio-economic importance.
The use of coupled climate models for the simulation of
climate change is considered in Chapter 6.

"Simulations of the coupled system require integrations
over 100-1000 simulated years (Cubasch et al., 1992;
Stouffer et al., 1994), and computational cost restricts the
| model complexity and resolution that is currently possible.
Table 5.1 lists the coupled model integrations that have
been completed or are currently underway, together with
some of their characteristics. The “model number” links
our discussion of the simulation of current climate with
that of climate change in Chapter 6. The first published
intercomparison of the simulation of the current climate
with coupled models was that of Gates et al. (1993), in
which a number of basic parameters were examined in four
models. Only one of these (MPI-LSG) appears in Table 5.1
and in Chapter 6. The remaining entries in the table
represent new coupled models or new versions of previous
models. Information from eleven of these coupled model
integrations (BMRC, CCC, COLA, CSIRO, GFDL. GISS1,

‘In recent years the systematic evaluation and
intercomparison of climate models and their components has
been a useful and popular mechanism for identifying
common model problems. For example, Boer et al. (1992)
identified a cold polar upper tropospheric bias of the then
current atmospheric general circulation models, and
Stockdale et al. (1993) showed that the then current ocean
general circulation models produced sea surface temperatures
(SSTs) that are too warm in the western tropical Pacific and
too cold along the equator in the east-central Pacific. Neclin
et al. (1992) found a wide variation in the ability of the then
current coupled models to simulate interannual variability in
the upper layers of the tropical Pacific, while Gates et al.
(1993) reported significant differences in the extended
control runs of four early coupled models. The evaluation of
land-surface schemes in progress under the auspices of the
Project for Intercomparison of Land surface Parametrization
Schemes (PILPS) (Henderson-Sellers et al., 1995) has
identified important differences in energy and water
partitioning at the surface. Comprehensive analysis and

"The atmosphere and ocean interact via fluxes of heat, momentum and fresh water. Local values of the heat flux are of
order hundreds of Wm and to first order the ocean is warmed in summer and cooled in winter, with the fluxes largely
cancelling on the annual average. The relatively small residual heat flux, together with the fresh water flux, control the
ocean’s thermohaline circulation and the associated poleward ocean in transports of heat and salt.

This conflict between the use of a fully physically based model and the use of a non-physical flux adjustment is
reduced if the response of the model to a perturbation is not seriously altered. The main purpose of the flux adjustment
is to ensure that any perturbation, such as that due to increased CO), is applied about a realistic reference climate so
that distortion of the major climate feedback processes is minimised (see Section 6.2.6). The need for flux adjustment
in coupled climate models will decrease as models are further improved.

from the observed three-dimensional distribution of
atmosphere-ocean-land-surface variables, but this approach
is not currently possible due to data limitations. An
alternative is to integrate the coupled model from arbitrary

under seasonally-varying forcing. Computational costs and
long oceanic time-scales usually preclude this, and the
typical experimental strategy is to “spin-up” separately the

Such “initialisation” of the coupled system, however, can
have a long-term effect on the simulated climate.

The differences are largest over the land, especially over

simulations do not include the direct effects of aerosols
which could change the differences in some areas.) By
contrast, differences over the ocean are rather small, with
largest differences found in the Southern Ocean. This is
particularly evident in the zonally averaged differences

"Inconsistencies between the surface fluxes developed in
atmosphere and ocean models during spin-up, as a result of
imperfections in either (or both) components, typically result
in a drift away from a realistic current climate when the
models are coupled. This is often ameliorated by flux
adjustment (see Box on flux adjustment) (Manabe and
Stouffer, 1988; Sausen et al., 1988). Here, for example, the
surface heat flux is modified for the ocean model by the
addition of a “flux adjustment” that depends on the mean
fluxes typically calculated by the separate ocean and
atmospheric models in the spin-up phase. A similar
adjustment may be made for the fresh water flux and surface
wind stress. It is also possible to adjust the surface temperature
of the ocean as seen by the atmospheric GCM, although this is
less common. The types of flux adjustments used in current
coupled model simulations are indicated in Table 5.1.

The seasonal average mean sea level pressure, displayed in
Figure 5.3, is a measure of both dynamical and
thermodynamical surface features and is linked to the
surface wind stress that drives the ocean. Current coupled
models succeed in representing the observed large-scale
geographical distribution of this field rather well as shown
in Figures 5.3a-f. The scatter among the models seen here
and in Figures 5.3g and h may be partly due to differences
in reduction to sea level, although the scatter at polar
latitudes is a characteristic difficulty also seen in uncoupled
atmospheric models (Boer et al., 1992).

thermohaline circulation through the fresh water flux.
Figures 5.2a~c and d-f show the global distribution of the
observed precipitation rate, the coupled models’ average,
and the intermodel standard deviation during DJF and JJA,
respectively. The coupled models are generally successful
in simulating the broad-scale structure of the observed
precipitation, although some features of the actual
precipitation are not well observed. The scatter among the
models is comparatively large in the tropics where the
precipitation rates are themselves largest, as seen in Figure
5.2g and h in terms of zonal averages. The globally
averaged precipitation rate is given in Table 5.2, where we

standard deviation of lower tropospheric temperature from
their coupled model and compared it with observations
from the microwave sounding unit (MSU) at “periods
greater than one month but less than twelve months”. The
simulated values were generally larger than those observed
in the tropics and smaller in southern high latitudes. The
model successfully simulated some of the features of the
observed intermonthly variation, including a representation
of the Madden-Julian Oscillation in the tropics and blocking

"5.2.3.5 Ocean surface heat flux and thermohaline circulation
The surface heat flux measures the energetic interaction of
the atmosphere and ocean, and together with the surface
fresh water flux, governs the strength of the ocean's
thermohaline circulation. Figure 5.4 shows the coupled
models’ net surface heat flux, while Figure 5.5 shows the
average heat flux adjustment in the models that use one.
All the coupled models portray the ocean’s absorption of
heat in summer and its release in winter (Figures 5.4a-f),
although there is a tendency for the modelled fluxes to
exceed the observationally based estimates on the zonal
average (Figure 5.4g and h). The heat flux adjustment,
however, is seen to vary widely among the models that use
it (Figure 5.5b and d; see also Table 5.1).

The standard deviation of decadal mean surface
temperature is shown in Figure 5.7. This measure of long
time-scale variability indicates that coupled models are
capable of simulating the observed increase of interdecadal
variability with latitude. The variability of decadal means
associated with the ice edge can also be seen in some
models. There are substantial unexplained differences
among the models, however, and this must be kept in mind
when interpreting the results of long-term transient

The extended coupled model integrations now becoming
available allow investigation of longer time-scale
variability. Although the surface air temperature has
perhaps the “best” observed long time-series record (100-
150 years), there are problems in comparing this record,
which includes the effects of both internally generated and
externally forced variability, with model simulations which
include only the internally generated component (Santer et
al., 1995b; Hegeri et al., 1996; Chapter 8). Such a
comparison is also hindered by the effects of sparse
observations during the early part of the record and at high
latitudes (Karl et al., 1993; Jones, 1994), and difficulties in
correcting the systematic errors due to urbanisation and
changes in measurement methods.

The key factors that affect the regional performance of
global coupled models are their horizontal resolution and
their physical paramctrizations. Coarse resolution
atmospheric models are unable to realistically portray the
extent and height of mountains, with consequent distortions
in their simulation of orographic precipitation on regional
scales, while coarse resolution ocean models suffer similar
distortions in their simulation of boundary currents. A
GCM’s resolution may also introduce systematic errors in
the depiction of coastlines, with consequent effects on the
simulation of regional circulation and temperature. With
their present horizontal resolution of several hundred km
(Table 5.1), the largest errors of coupled models” simulation
of the observed seasonal temperature generally occur on the
smaller resolved scales over the continents (Figure 5.1).
Differences between models also tend to be greater at the
regional scale (Figure 5.1). See Chapter 6 (Section 6.6.1 and
Figure 6.32) where the regional simulations of precipitation
and surface temperature by five coupled ocean-atmosphere
models are compared with observations.

with careful placement of the boundaries of the area, such
models can portray the climate at regional and local scales

"Here we present a new assessment of the ability of current
atmospheric GCMs to simulate the observed mean seasonal
climate. For this purpose we use the emerging results of the
international Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project
(AMIP) (Gates, 1992). Virtually all global atmospheric
modelling groups! are participating in this project, which calls
for a ten-year simulation under agreed conditions. The AMIP
boundary conditions used by all participating atmospheric
GCMs consist of the 1979 to 1988 sequence of observed
monthly averaged distributions of sea surface temperature and
sea ice, an atmosphere CO, concentration of 345 ppmv and a
value of 1365 Wm for the solar constant. We focus here on
the AMIP models’ simulation of selected variables that were
not considered in the section on coupled models (Section 5.2).
The actual climate is given by observational estimates that are
believed to be the most representative of the AMIP decade,
although in some cases other data are also used to provide
global coverage. For this purpose both the models’ results and
the observed data were regridded to a common 4° latitude and

the atmospheric radiation budget is the cloud radiative
forcing, which is defined as the difference in the radiative

radiation in the Earth-atmosphere system, long-wave cloud

The surface climate over land is important for many aspects
of human well-being. The land-surface components of
coupled climate models range from rather simple schemes to
complex representations of soil and vegetation. Increased
‘realism in land-surface parametrizations has been shown to
improve the representation of surface climates, but has also
led to different sensitivities to atmospheric forcing,
particularly in terms of precipitation and net surface radiation.
The dearth of appropriate observations hinders land-surface

Land- surface processes partition the precipitation among

between latent (evaporation) and sensible heat loss. The
land surface also alters radiative fluxes through the albedo
and surface temperature. Momentum exchange between the
atmosphere and the land surface is determined by the
representation of surface drag. The parametrization of these
processes affects short-period meteorological behaviour

In the 1970s and early 1980s, the representation of land-
surface processes used prescribed albedos and roughness
lengths and a simple “bucket” hydrology (precipitation
filled the “bucket”, evaporation emptied it, and runoff
occurred when the “bucket” overflowed; Manabe, 1969).
More recent land-surface parametrizations include
representations of leaves, roots, multiple soil types and
layers, an interception store, the dependence of albedo,
roughness and stomatal conductance on the type of
vegetation and its canopy geometry, and carbon uptake and
respiration (Sellers, 1992; Dickinson et al., 1993; Koster
and Saurez, 1994). These land-surface schemes generally
reduce the overestimation of land-surface evaporation given
by “bucket” schemes in the tropics (Sellers, 1992; Scott er
al., 1996), and improve the simulation of the diurnal cycles
of evaporative and other surface fluxes (Dickinson and
Henderson-Sellers, 1988). The divergence among current
land-surface parametrization schemes (Pitman ef al., 1993;
Henderson-Sellers ef al., 1995), when combined with the
different forcing supplied by different atmospheric models
(Shuttleworth and Dickinson, 1989; Garratt, 1993), results
in a wider range of land-surface hydroclimates than was
reported in IPCC (1990). Although determining soil
moisture or river discharge off-line in an impact model can
produce different results from those determined in a GCM,
it is difficult to discern the better schemes because adequate
evaluation data are generally lacking.

In summary, the general agreement found among the
results of relatively simple land-surface schemes in 1990
has been reduced by the introduction of more complex
parametrizations. While models can be tuned for particular
locations, regional distributions depend upon the adequacy
of the forcing meteorology and the antecedent conditions,
both of which are difficult to establish. Use of site-specific
parameters improves the simulation in more realistic
models, but the lack of suitable observations is inhibiting
the development and evaluation of universal land-surface

The oceanic components of present coupled models range
in spatial resolution from around 1 to 4 horizontally and
from 6 to 30 vertical levels. Current “high-resolution”
ocean models have many more vertical levels (up to 60)
and have resolutions as fine as 4°. The counterpart to
meteorological weather occurs in the ocean in the form of
eddies at scales of less than 2°. The high resolution
models mentioned above explicitly resolve much of the
mixing due to eddies but at great computational expense,
while the lower resolution models typically used in climate
simulations must use parametric representations of the
mixing. Here the former class of model is referred to as
eddy-resolving, and the latter as coarse resolution or non-
eddy-resolving.

"Semtner (1994) finds that many of the known features of
the global ocean circulation are reproduced by the sixth-
degree global simulation at Los Alamos. In particular, this
model provides support for the hypothesised routes of low-
salinity warm water from the western Pacific to the North
Atlantic via the Indonesian throughflow (Figure 5.27),
which is a critical element of North Atlantic overturning.
This result suggests that non-eddy-resolving ocean models
without such a route may not realistically account for this
overturning. Figure 5.28 shows analyses of the horizontal
wavenumber spectra (representing the potential energy as a
function of scale) at 400 m and 800 m at 24°N in the
western Pacific Ocean, based on observations and on the
NCAR and Los Alamos model integrations. The NCAR
mode! matches the observed variability at 800 m but shows
too little variability at 400 m, even at scales which are well
resolved by the model. The finer-resolution Los Alamos
model matches the observed temperature variability at both
depths except at the shortest wavelengths. From these and
other comparisons between observed and modelled spatial
variability, it has been suggested that 2° resolution will
be needed in ocean models before the modelled variability

converges to the observed spectra.

While there has been considerable progress in the study of
ocean variability at decadal and longer time-scales with
stand-alone ocean models (Weaver and Hughes, 1992), the
lack of suitable verifying data in the deep ocean has
inhibited model evaluation. Long SST data sets have
enabled extended atmospheric model integrations under
realistic boundary conditions (Bottomley et al., 1990;
Parker er al., 1994), but similar integrations for the ocean
will require, at a minimum, an extended record of global
wind stress and estimates of fresh water forcing,
particularly at high latitudes. Nevertheless, decadal
variability has been found in ocean models in basins where
deep water formation occurs (Weaver and Sarachik, 1991a;
Greatbatch and Zhang, 1994; Weaver er al., 1994; Weisse
et al., 1994), and further analysis of such results might help
to interpret some of the causes of decadal variability found
in coupled models such as those of Delworth et al. (1993)
(see Section 5.2.4.3). The latter authors have identified
irregular oscillations of the North Atlantic thermohaline
circulation in a long coupled model simulation, in which
the circulation anomalies are driven by out-of-phase
density anomalies in the sinking and rising regions. The

that this improved the simulation of the circulation and
heat transport. Recent studies of the mixing associated with
mesoscale eddies (Gent and McWilliams, 1990; Gent et al.,
1995) and that associated with convection (Send and
Marshall, 1996) are motivated in part by recognised
discrepancies between ocean climate models and
observations. Danabasoglu et al. (1994) have shown
promising results from experiments using a parametrization
for mesoscale eddy-induced mixing. When such
parametrization was used in an oceanic general circulation
model, the thermocline became sharper, the deep ocean
became colder, and the meridional transport of heat and
salt increased (Figure 5.30). Robitaille and Weaver (1995)
and England (1995) have also shown that this
parametrization improves the ability of a global ocean
model to reproduce observed CFC distributions (see Figure

obtained using traditional mixing schemes, and address

The observational data sets on which the evaluation of
ocean models rests have significant spatial and temporal
shortcomings, with many regions of the global ocean not
sampled and many others having only short sampling
records. This means it is difficult to form a reliable
estimate of the ocean climate and its variability. Evaluation
of ocean models in the coastal region is critical for regional
interpretation of projected changes in sea level, and the
interactions between the open ocean and coastal regions are
affected by the fresh water input to ocean models from
continental runoff (Section 5.3.2). The need for flux
adjustment is an explicit recognition of the inadequacies of
the components of coupled climate models (Section 5.2.2),
and evaluation of (and better parametrizations for) air-sea
exchanges are necessary for the sustained improvement of

Evaluation of sea ice in the current generation of models
is usually limited to comparison of the modelled and
observed ice edge position (as available from satellites,
e.g., Gloersen ef al., 1992). A common problem in coarse-
resolution coupled climate models is an ice edge that is too
far equatorward in the North Atlantic but not far enough
equatorward in the Southern Ocean (Washington and
Meehl, 1989; Henderson-Sellers and Hansen, 1995). Under
these circumstances it is difficult to achieve an adequate
simulation of the surface fresh water fluxes that are crucial
to sea ice formation. Flux adjustment may be undertaken
for ice-covered areas, although it is not as straightforward
as over the open ocean because of strong feedback effects.
(For instance, if the flux adjustment is negative the result
may be an unstable growth of ice when the ice advances
over a cooling ocean.) Observations of sea ice thickness are
needed for evaluating the model treatment of
thermodynamic growth and melting, ice dynamics, and the
effects of ocean and atmospheric circulation on ice
deformation; only a tentative climatology is available for
the Arctic based on sparse submarine sonar observations
(Bourke and Garrett, 1987) and drill-hole observations in
the thinner ice of the Antarctic. Satellite-based ice

buoys are also available.

a marked influence on a model’s transient behaviour in the
tropics as shown in Figure 5.34. In the UGAMP model, the
Kuo scheme significantly underestimates the observed
variability of the outgoing long-wave radiation, while there
is a tendency for the Betts-Miller scheme to overestimate
it. Recent studies by Wang and Schlesinger (1995) suggest,
however, that with some adjustment of parameters (e.g.,
the threshold relative humidity) currently used convection
schemes can be made to produce realistic intraseasonal
oscillations.

The sensitivity of the surface climate to the parametrization
of the land surface has been considered in Section 5.3.2. In
anticipation of their importance to climate change studies
(see Chapter 6), here we note that recent studies by
Thompson and Pollard (1996) show that the Land Surface

’ Transfer (LSX) scheme produces smaller variations of soil
moisture in a greenhouse simulation than does a bucket
scheme. Henderson-Sellers et al. (1995) have also found
that a doubling of stomatal resistance in the Biosphere-
Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (BATS) significantly
reduces the evaporative flux over the northern mid-latitude
continents in summer. These results demonstrate the urgent
need for further studies of the climate’s sensitivity to land-
surface processes in order to determine which schemes are
the more realistic.

Climate models are also known to be sensitive to details
of the parametrization of cloud microphysical processes. In
particular, Fowler and Randall (1996) have found
significant differences in the proportions of cloud liquid
water and cloud ice in the CSU model depending upon the
temperature range in which they are allowed to coexist,
although the inclusion of cloud microphysics in the CSU
model generally improves the simulation of cloud radiative
forcing. Other studies show a marked sensitivity to the
choice of cloud parametrizations (Mitchell et al., 1989; Le
Treut and Li, 1991; Boer, 1993; Senior and Mitchell, 1993;
Washington and Meehl, 1993; Meehl and Washington,
1995; Kiehl, 1996), and a consensus on which
parametrizations are the most appropriate has not yet been
reached.

removed by considering an ensemble of simulations made

especially useful when considering interannual variability

Sensitivity studies have also suggested that a model’s
response to changes in external forcing may usefully be
viewed as systematic changes in the amplitude and

discussed in Chapter 6 in connection with future climate
projections.

"Confidence in climate models depends partly upon their
ability to simulate the current climate and recent climate
changes, and partly upon the realistic representation of the
physical processes that are important to the climate system.
Current models of the atmosphere, ocean, Jand surface and
sea ice may be rated as good to very good on these
grounds, while coupled models may be rated as fair to
good. This seeming discrepancy is due to the fact that most
coupled climate models do not yet include the newer

Model evaluation needs to be carried out with an emphasis
on those aspects and processes that are critical to model
performance, such as cloud radiative effects and ocean
surface fluxes. Co-ordinated model intercomparisons such as
AMIP (Gates, 1992) or PILPS (Henderson-Sellers and
Dickinson, 1992) are useful in this regard, since they serve to
identify common errors and to document model performance
and improvement. The evaluation and intercomparison of
coupled models in particular needs to be intensified and
broadened, and increased recognition needs to be given to
comprehensive evaluation as an essential part of modelling.

The sensitivity of the thermohaline circulation to the
surface boundary conditions in coarse resolution ocean
models has been explored by Birchfield (1989), Power and
Kleeman (1993, 1994), Zhang et al. (1993), Mikolajewicz
and Maier-Reimer (1994), Power et al. (1994, 1995) and
Rahmstorf and Willebrand (1996), although the
corresponding studies with eddy-resolving models have not
yet been made. These studies indicate that more realistic
formulations of the surface fluxes in ocean models generally
increase the stability of the thermohaline circulation and
generally improve the realism of the solutions.

"Clouds, the hydrological cycle and the treatment of the
land surface remain the largest areas of uncertainty in
climate models, and are generally the cause of the largest
intermodel differences in both control and sensitivity
experiments. Although a large number of sensitivity studies
have been conducted, it is still difficult to identify the best
overall formulations and parametrizations to be used in
climate models. Recent experience suggests that a higher
horizontal resolution than that achieved in most earlier
studies is needed in atmospheric models, although the
minimum resolution requirements for ocean models remain
to be determined.

"As discussed more fully in Chapter 6, the successful
simulation of some of the climate changes that have taken
place during the past century has provided increased
confidence in using coupled models for projections of
future climate change. In particular, the recent coupled
climate simulations of Mitchell et al. (1995a) and
Hasselmann et al. (1995) have included the direct effect of
sulphate aerosols along with changing levels of carbon
dioxide concentration. While there are many uncertainties
associated with both the implied radiative forcing due to
aerosols and the climate sensitivity of the models used (and
other important forcings such as those due to volcanic and
other aerosols, solar variation, ozone and other greenhouse
gases are yet to be included), a clear improvement is
evident in the simulation of the observed change in the
global surface air temperature and the zonal average of the
vertical distribution of temperature over the last few
decades (see Chapter 8).

"The development of more complete, more efficient, and
more accurate coupled models has long been the aim of the
climate modelling community, since it is generally
believed that it is only through such models that we can
gain a scientific understanding (and hence a reliable
predictive capability) of climate and climate change.
Although some modelling innovations at times appear
to give puzzling results, and model evaluation has not
always been carried out as systematically as it should be,
the progressive development of more realistic
parametrizations, the improvement of numerical techniques
and resolution, and the inclusion of previously missing
processes has in general led to better climate models. This
faith in the fundamental] soundness of the modelling
approach does not deny the presence of significant errors in
current models nor the utility of models known to be
incomplete, but does provide confidence that these errors
can and will be reduced through continuing modelling
research.

Climate simulations using GCMs require substantial
computer resources and it is not generally feasible to carry
out separate simulations for a large number of forcing
scenarios. In order to interpolate and extrapolate global
mean projections from GCMs to a wider range of
greenhouse gas and aerosol scenarios, simple upwelling
diffusion-energy balance models are employed. These
models are calibrated to give the same globally averaged
temperature response as the global coupled GCMs. Since
the amount of anthropogenic aerosols has most probably
grown alongside the growth in fossil fuel use since pre-
industrial times, the estimated historical changes of
radiative forcing up to 1990 used in this report for global
mean temperature projections include a component due to
aerosols.

Recent estimates of regional climate changes, that did not
take into account the effects of aerosols, for the year 2030
for five areas match the spread of the earlier results
reported in IPCC (1990): temperature changes due to a
doubling of CO, concentration varied between 0.6°C and
7°C and precipitation changes varied from -35% to +50%
of control run values. Tropospheric aerosols arising from
human activities, because of their uneven spatial
distribution, are likely to greatly influence future regional
climate change.

A general warming would tend to lead to an increase in
extremely high temperature events and a decrease in winter
days with extremely low temperatures (e.g., frost days in
some areas), With increasing greenhouse gas concentration,
many models suggest an increase in the probability of
intense precipitation. A number of simulations also show in
some areas an increase in the probability of dry days and the
length of dry spells (consecutive days without
precipitation). Where mean precipitation decreases, the
likelihood of drought increases. New results reinforce the
view that variability associated with the enhanced
hydrological cycle translates into prospects for more severe
droughts and/or floods in some places and less severe
droughts and/or floods in other places.

Most results are obtained using (equivalent) CO,-only
scenarios starting from present day conditions. Two studies
start with mid-19th century conditions and also take into
account the negative radiative forcing of sulphate aerosols
(direct effect), though the results have not yet been fully
analysed. These studies are a first step towards
incorporating more realistic forcings into the models.

"By the time of writing of the 1992 IPCC Supplementary
Report (IPCC 1992), only four centres had completed
extended transient coupled experiments. An additional
seven centres have now completed such experiments
(Table 6.3: details of many of the models are given in
Table 5.1 of Chapter 5), and the original four centres have
completed new simulations with higher resolution and/or
different scenarios. Here we assess the results from
transient simulations with a gradual increase in CO,; these
largely confirm the findings in IPCC (1992). As noted in
Section 2.4, forcing from sulphate aerosols may have a
marked effect on spatial patterns of climate change, even if
their global mean forcing is small relative to that from
greenhouse gases. We also consider new transient
simulations which indicate the likely additional effect on
the magnitude and patterns of climate change of increases
in concentrations of sulphate aerosols. A wider range of
emission scenarios using simpler energy balance models is
considered in Section 6.3. Finally, additional technical
matters which are nevertheless pertinent to the
interpretation of model results are considered.

The direct sulphate aerosol forcing produces a cooling
which is most pronounced over the northern mid-latitude

also large in the vicinity of winter sea ice, even though the
radiative forcing is zero at this time (the polar night). This
is because the aerosol cooling is spread by the atmospheric

In recent decades, a widespread decrease in diurnal
temperature range has been reported over the main
continents (Chapter 3). In IPCC (1990), a few studies
reported a small decrease in diurnal range in equilibrium 2 X
CO, experiments, though at that stage no detailed analysis
had been performed. More recent studies show that decreases
are associated with increased evaporative cooling and other
features accompanying climate warming (Cao et al., 1992,
Hansen et al., 1995), The changes vary with location and
season, and from model to model, though decreases are
predominant (for example Cao et al., 1992; Cubasch er al.,

"The most obvious effect of aerosol forcing is a tendency
to reduce diurnal range, since it reduces the amplitude of
the diurnal cycle of insolation. However, simulations with
aerosol forcing included indicate that other feedbacks can
counteract this effect. Sulphate aerosols can cool climate
leading to a reduction in evaporative cooling of the surface,
and an increase in global mean diurnal range (Hansen et
al., 1995; Mitchell et al., 1995a). In other words, the
cooling reverses the processes that lead to a reduced
diurnal range in CO, only experiments. In these two
studies, it is only in regions of maximum aerosol loading
that the reduction in the diurnal amplitude of solar heating
due to the presence of aerosol is sufficient to produce a net
reduction in diurnal range due to aerosols. One
consequence of this finding, if correct, is that the observed
reduction in diurnal range cannot necessarily be attributed

to increases in sulphate aerosols.

"In energy balance models it is usually assumed that the
sensitivity of global mean surface temperature to global
mean acrosol forcing (defined here as temperature
response/unit forcing) is the same as to global mean
greenhouse gas forcing. There is some evidence that the
sensitivity to aerosol forcing is greater than to CO, forcing,
at least for small amounts of aerosol (Table 6.1). However,
because of the large interdecadal variability of temperature
and the small aerosol forcing generally used, longer
experiments than those listed in Table 6.1 are required to
demonstrate that the apparent difference is not an artefact of
poor sampling. With a larger aerosol forcing, and hence a
larger signal-to-noise ratio, Mitchell et al. (1995a) found that
sensitivity to acrosol and greenhouse gas forcing was similar.
This result suggests that using the same global mean climate

equivalent increase in CO) and direct sulphate aerosol forcing are those estimated to have occurred since 1900. Note that

beginning of the century are unreliable, but the period
corresponds to when most of the increase in radiative
forcing occurred and so allows qualitative comparison).
The addition of aerosol effects (S3, Figure 6.2c) leads to
slightly larger reductions in diurnal range in parts of mid-
latitudes. The seasonal variation of the changes in diurnal
range is similar to that observed, with smaller reductions
occurring in northern spring and summer (Table 6.2). The
observed changes are discussed in Section 3.2.2.4. Hansen
et al. (1995) find that increases in CO, and aerosols alone
are insufficient to explain the observed reduction in diurnal
range, which they can only explain by additionally
increasing cloud.

As noted above, there is growing evidence that increases
in sulphate aerosols are partially counteracting the radiative
forcing due to increases in greenhouse gases (Chapter 2).
The temporal evolution of sulphate aerosol concentrations
can be estimated from sulphur emission inventories (for
example, Dignon and Hameed, 1989), assuming a constant
ratio between emissions and concentrations, or through an
explicit sulphur cycle model. To generate spatial
distributions of sulphate aerosol concentration for use in
transient GCM simulations, Hasselmann er al. (1995) used
decadal means derived using the MOGUNTIA model
(Langner and Rodhe, 1991), whereas Mitchell er al.
(1995b) scaled the pattern given by Langner and Rodhe
(1991) by the global mean emissions for each decade. Both
the GCM experiments included only the direct effect of
sulphate aerosols, represented by an appropriate increase in
surface albedo (see Section 6.2.1.1).

preliminary GCM studies include only an estimate of the

forcing. Finally, there are uncertainties in the observations,

coupled atmosphere-ocean climate model experiments

and initial conditions (Table 6.3). The experiments are

"Most transient experiments with AOGCMs are based on
certain simplifying assumptions. First, they represent the
effect of increases in all greenhouse gases by increases in
CO, (Chapter 5). Second, apart from experiments x,y,w and
z, they ignore the effects of the historical increases in
forcing which leads to an underestimate of the initial rate
of change (the “cold start”, described in Section 6.2.4).
Finally, they use simplified versions of the IPCC scenarios.
A majority of the experiments assume a 1%/yr compound
increase in CO, which gives a doubling of CO, after 70
years (Table 6,3). With a 1%/yr increase in equivalent
CO,, the radiative forcing is generally about 20% greater
than that under Scenario IS92a which gives a doubling of
equivalent CO, after about 95 years. For comparison, the
actual increase in equivalent CO, (i.e., allowing for
increases in CO, and other trace gases) over the last decade
or so has been about 0.7%/yr which, if maintained, would
lead to a doubling of equivalent CO, in 100 years.
"	Text
"When cooling due to aerosols is included in some form,
then an improved agreement with the observational record
of global mean surface temperature in the last few decades
is found in almost all studies (for example Figures 6.3)
using models with the level of climate sensitivity found in
current AOGCMs. As in the equilibrium experiments
described above, the aerosol forcing considerably reduces
the surface warming in the northern extratropics, and even
leads to cooling in some regions. The amplification of the
surface warming in northern high latitudes is also reduced
— for example in z the warming in the Arctic from period
1880 to 1920 to the decade 1980 to 1990 is similar to the
global mean warming. Mitchell et al. (1995b) found that
the spatial correlation of simulated temperature change
with that observed is also higher in the last few decades
when aerosol effects are included (see also Figure 8.6).
This indicates that the effect of sulphate aerosol and other
forcings should be taken into account in attempts to detect
or attribute climate change, as noted in Chapter 8.

Since IPCC (1990), attempts have been made to include the
effects of increases in sulphate aerosol concentrations in
models, as these may have a strong influence on patterns of
climate change (see Section 2.4, Section 6.2.1, Chapter 8).
The two experiments above which included the historical
increase in greenhouse gas forcing (x, and w) were
repeated with the direct effect of increases in sulphate
aerosol represented by an increase in surface albedo
(Section 6.2.1.2). The distribution of sulphate aerosols
concentrations from 1990 in each case was derived using
the MOGUNTIA sulphur cycle model (Langner and
Rodhe, 1991) and sulphur emission scenarios under 1S92a
(IPCC, 1992). In z, the global mean aerosol forcing
increases from 0.6 Wm”? in 1990 to about 1.3 Wm in
2050. IS92a assumes a doubling of sulphur emissions by

generally stronger over the land than the ocean (for

latitudes, the presence of snow produces a positive
temperature albedo feedback which is absent over the
ocean. The temperature response will also be enhanced

Many studies report a decrease in the strength of the
North Atlantic thermohaline (meridional) circulation (a,d-
i,k,m,s,t,w). Note that in two models (a,k), the thermohaline
circulation is weak or weakening throughout the control
simulation and in p this circulation is almost non-existent
{Chapter 5). The strength of the reduction varies from
model to model, from around 30% at the time of doubling
(g,8) to less than 10% (t). This change has been studied in
more detail in only a few experiments (g,s,m). In the
warmer climate, the decrease is associated with an increase
in the moisture supply to the surface (precipitation in high
latitudes increases more than evaporation) which reduces
the salinity and thus the density of surface water, and
inhibits the sinking of water at high latitudes (e.g., Manabe
et al., 1991, Murphy and Mitchell, 1995). These authors
also find a similar freshening of the upper layers in high
southern latitudes. The greater penetration of heat in high
latitudes may also reduce the meridional density gradient,
further slowing the meridional circulation. The weakening
of this circulation further inhibits warming, or may even
produce local cooling (for example, Figure 6.7b), in
regions of deep water formation.

Two simulations (x,w) were forced with the historical

increase in equivalent CO, and then a 1%/yr increase in
equivalent CO,. The patterns of change are qualitatively
similar to those in the experiments above. In Section
6.2.1.2 (see also Section 8.4.2.3), we saw that the inclusion
of the direct sulphate aerosol forcing can improve the
simulation of the patterns of temperature change over the
last few decades. Here we consider the effect of combined
greenhouse gas and direct sulphate aerosol forcing derived

Increasing CO, alone leads to positive radiative forcing
everywhere, with the largest radiative heating in regions of
clear skies and high temperatures (experiment w shown in
Figure 6.7a). The surface temperature warms everywhere
except in the northern north Atlantic (Figure 6.7b). In
transient simulations to 2050, the inclusion of aerosols
based on [S92a (y,z) reduces the global mean radiative
forcing, and leads to negative radiative forcing over
southern Asia, particularly in the east (experiment z shown
in Figure 6.7c). This leads to a muted warming (Figure
6.7d) or even small regions of cooling (y) in mid-latitudes.
In z, China continues to warm (Figure 6.7d), albeit at a
very reduced rate, even though the local net radiative
forcing becomes increasingly negative (Figure 6.7c). The
rate of warming over North America and western Europe,
where the aerosol forcing weakens, remains below that in
the simulation with greenhouse gases only (w). The cooling
due to aerosols is amplified by sea ice feedbacks in the
Arctic (Figure 6.7f).

With increases in CO,, all models produce a maximum
annual mean warming in high northern latitudes (Figures
6.6 and 6.7b). The warming is largest in late autumn and
winter, largely due to sea ice forming later in the warmer
climate. In summer, the warming is small — if the sea ice is
removed with increased CO,, then the thermal inertia of
the mixed-layer prevents substantial warming during the
short summer season, otherwise melting sea ice is present
in both control and anomaly simulations, and there is no
change in surface temperature (see Ingram et al., 1989).
The details of these changes are sensitive to
parametrization of sea ice, and in particular, the
specification of sea ice albedo (e.g., Mech] and
Washington, 1995). In one simulation (k) there is a
marked cooling over the north-eastern Atlantic throughout
the year which leads to a cooling over part of north-west
Europe in winter. There is little seasonal variation of the
warming in low latitudes or over the southern circumpolar
ocean.

"Most models produce a general increase in soil moisture

some (4,k) there are also substantial areas of reduction (e.g.,

precipitation discussed above, and the increased fraction of
precipitation falling as rain in the warmer climate. At the
low winter temperatures, the absolute change in potential
evaporation is small, as expected from the Clausius-
Clapyeron relation, so evaporation increases little even
though temperature increases are a maximum in winter.
Hence the increase in soil moisture in high altitudes in
winter is consistent with physical reasoning and the broad

It is more difficult to assess the likely effect of removing

flux corrections generally occur in regions of strong
horizontal temperature gradient: others are associated with
errors in cloud, in resolving local upwelling and in
positioning the sea ice margins. As these errors vary from

also likely to be vary from model to model. It is not
obvious that these errors have a dramatic effect on the

Coupled atmosphere-ocean models produce considerable
variability on interanual and interdecadal time-scales
(Chapter 5), as in the real world (Chapter 3). Thus, in any
single realisation, unforced variations will form a
substantial part of the simulated response. Hence, the
evolution of the patterns of change as the forcing increases
will not be smooth, and experiments repeated from slightly
different initial conditions will produce responses which
differ in detail. A more representative estimate of the
response to the forcing may be obtained by carrying out an
ensemble of experiments starting from slightly different
initial conditions, and reducing the expected contribution
from natural variability by averaging the results. Cubasch
et al. (1994b) found that averaging over several
simulations did lead to smoother patterns of change. It is
possible to estimate the stability of features of the response
by comparing different members of the ensemble. This is
particularly important for prediction of regional climate
change (Section 6.6), since the internal variability
generally increases as the size of the averaging region is
reduced (Figure 1.5). The ensemble approach also allows
one to estimate the statistical distribution of possible
outcomes which arise through unpredictable internal
variations.

Predictions of the rate of climate change over the next few
decades are of particular importance, both for the detection
and attribution of climate change, and for the estimation of
climate impacts. Over the last two centuries, there has been
a gradual build up of the gross radiative forcing due to
increases in greenhouse gases (Chapter 2). Most
experiments in Table 6.3 do not account for the past build
up of gases. Hence they produce a small initial rate of
warming over the first one or two decades, a phenomenon
known as the cold start. This complication is removed in the
most recent experiments (x,y,w,z) which start from the last
century when the increases in greenhouse gases were small.

In 1990, preliminary results from only one transient CO,

ignore the effect of any previous increase in greenhouse

the case if earlier greenhouse gas increases are taken into

We follow IPCC (1990) (Bretherton et al., 1990) and
IPCC (1992) (Mitchell and Gregory, 1992) in using a
relatively simple upwelling diffusion-energy balance
climate model (UD/EB) to make these projections. The
specific model used (as in 1990 and 1992) is that of Wigley
and Raper (1987, 1992). Although based on the original
model of this type (Hoffert et al., 1980), this particular
model differs from others in that it distinguishes between
land and ocean and between the hemispheres (by treating
them as separate “boxes”, with energy flows between the
“boxes”). Such differentiation is important in the present
context because there are large radiative forcing
differences between these different parts of the globe.

Including the effects of aerosols as well as greenhouse
gases (based on [S92a) in simulations of future climate
leads to much reduced warming in mid-latitudes, not only
in regions where the atmosphere burden of aerosols is
increasing, but also in some regions where it is decreasing.
There are also marked changes in the hydrological cycle,
principally in the Northern Hemisphere in summer. In
particular, there is net reduction of precipitation in the
Asian summer monsoon, and the summer drying over
Europe and North America is weakened or even reversed.
These preliminary results should be used with caution: the
results are based on two studies and are likely to be quite
sensitive to the choice of scenario and the assumptions in
deriving the radiative forcing due to aerosols, both of
which are subject to considerable uncertainty. They also
neglect the effect of other anthropogenic forcing including
indirect sulphate effects, soot, tropospheric ozone and
aerosol from biomass burning.

To verify that the UD/EB model, when properly
calibrated, is able to simulate accurately the behaviour of the
AOGCMs of Chapter 5 and Section 6.2, intercomparison
exercises were carried out using results from the GFDL
AOGCM (R. Stouffer pers. comm.; Manabe and Stouffer,

the UD/EB model climate sensitivity was set at the GFDL

2 X CO,). All other UD/EB model parameters were kept at
values previously chosen (see Wigley and Raper, 1991), as
specified above. The value of the land/ocean sensitivity
differential (1.3), chosen on the basis of other GCM results
(Raper et al., 1996), is similar to that for the GFDL model.

To accord with recent coupled atmosphere-ocean model
results, two important changes have been made to the
model’s structure compared with its previous applications.
First, evidence that indicates that the climate sensitivity
differs between land and ocean: most models give a
different equilibrium warming over these regions (see, e.g.,
Cubasch et al., 1992; Murphy, 1995b). It is important to
simulate this differential warming, not least because of its
potential effect on oceanic thermal expansion, an important
component of sea level rise. (Thermal expansion results
produced here are used in the sea level projections given in
Chapter 7.) If warming over the oceans is less than over the
land, the amount of thermal expansion will be less than
might be estimated on the basis of global mean temperature
alone. To account for this differential sensitivity the single
parameter AT;,,, is replaced by two parameters, a global
mean AT,,. and an equilibrium land/ocean warming ratio
for 2 X CO). For the latter, we use the value 1.3 based on
coupled atmosphere-ocean model and equilibrium GCM
results. For AT), we use a range of values to capture the
uncertainty in this parameter.

AOGCM. If this reflects a real deficiency in the UD/EB

between the two models. For thermal expansion, the
comparison is less good. However, these comparison
results are less easy to interpret than the GFDL
comparisons because the MPI model shows, in the first
100-200 years of its control run, a century time-scale
adjustment to small initial flux imbalances. This low-

We consider first global mean temperature projections for
the central IPCC (1992) emission scenario, IS92a. Figure
6.20 shows temperature changes over 1990 to 2100 for
climate sensitivities of AT, = 1.5, 2.5 and 4.5°C for the
changing aerosol (full lines) and constant aerosol (dashed
lines) cases. The central sensitivity value gives a warming
of 2.0°C (changing aerosols) to 2.4°C (constant aerosols).
The uncertainty due to AT,,, uncertainties is large, and
aerosol-related uncertainties are larger for larger AT...
These results are similar to those given by Wigley and
Raper (1992) who gave a central estimate of 2.5°C
warming over 1990 to 2100 for IS92a. The present values
are slightly lower because of differences in the radiative
forcing details (see Table 6.4), and because our present
incorporation of a slow-down in the thermohaline
circulation also slows down the rate of warming (although
it increases the amount of oceanic thermal expansion). For
a more detailed discussion of the effect of thermohaline
circulation changes, see Raper et al. (1996).

give rapidly diverging temperature projections in the
second half of the 21st century: for the changing aerosol
case, the range of values spans 1.2°C by the year 2100.
This behaviour illustrates the long-term nature of the
climate change problem. There are two areas where there
are appreciable Jags in the system; between emission
changes and concentration changes for CO, (and hence
radiative forcing), and between radiative forcing changes
and climate response. Inertia in both the carbon cycle and
the climate system leads to a very long lag between CO,
emissions changes and their eventual effect on climate.

2.0°C compared with 3.3°C for a sensitivity of 2.5°C. This

two emission scenarios (the lower emissions for CO, and
the halocarbons, in particular, lead to lower forcing and
hence reduced warming); improvements to the carbon cycle
model used to make CO, concentration projections
(inclusion of a terrestrial sink term has led to lower
concentrations); the inclusion of the cooling effect of
aerosols in the current projections; the lower historical
forcing to 1990 (now 1.32 Wm compared with 2.45 Wm

most important of these is that associated with the carbon
cycle (see Wigley, 1994). We have used only central!
estimates of carbon cycle model parameters in obtaining
future CO, concentrations: within the range of parameter
uncertainties the CO, forcing to 2100 could be increased
by a few tenths of a Wm~, corresponding to an
additionalwarming of 0.1-0.2°C. There are also important
uncertainties associated with the climate model. For many
of these, the effects are relatively small (see Wigley and
Raper, 1993). However, if the thermohaline circulation
were not to slow down as assumed here, there could be an
additional warming over 1990 to 2100 of more than 1°C

from 4.5°C to 5,.7°C)!, (The effects of the above
uncertainties on the lower bound value are small.) In
assessing the significance of these extreme values, it
should be noted that the probability of exceeding the
bounds is likely to be small because they concatenate two
possibilities that both have relatively low probability (viz.,
emissions outside the I1S92c to 1S92e range, and climate
sensitivity outside the range AT,, = 1.5-4.5°C).

The definition of variability in this section is the
quantification of deviations from some mean value (e.g.,
standard deviation or variance on monthly or longer time-
scales). We will examine changes in these variability
measures between simulated present-day and increased-
CO, climates. These changes in variability are distinct
from simple shifts in respective means between the two
climate states. Section 6.5 will examine possible changes
of extreme events on time-scales less than one month. This
latter category is obviously related to changes in variability
and is defined by specific meteorological occurrences that
may be infrequent in time and space, and that affect society
or an ecosystem at a certain location.

Raper et al., the effect of other anthropogenic forcing
factors might amplify the warming to 2100, based on the
IS92 scenarios (compare the CO,-alone case with the full

these other gases is impossible to estimate. Figure 6.26

"of the climate system with an increase of CO, and trace
gases. The 1990 Assessment focused on changes in mean
climate and relied mainly on results from atmospheric
models coupled to non-dynamic slab oceans (so-called
“mixed-layer models”) that were not capable of simulating
any variability associated with the El Nifio-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO). Since a major source of global
interannual variability is associated with ENSO, models
that cannot simulate ENSO-like oscillations are seriously
constrained when used to examine possible changes in
variability. The 1992 Supplement contained results from
four global AOGCMs that contained some aspects of
ENSO-like variability (e.g., Meehl, 1990; Lau er al., 1992),
but most of the reported results still involved changes in
mean climate produced by those models. Even though
ENSO-like variability is now represented in present global
coupled models, caution must be exercised when
interpreting the results since only some aspects of ENSO
are simulated and the variability tends to be underestimated
(see Chapter 5). Also in the earlier IPCC reports, there was
a brief discussion of possible changes in variability, but
most of those studies were in the early stages.
Subsequently there has been additional work done to
analyse how variability is represented in climate models
(Chapter 5) as well as how changes in variability are
simulated in climate models. More global AOGCM
experiments have now been completed and there have been
studies using mixed-layer and specified SST models to
explore further the mechanisms of possible variability
changes suggested by the global coupled models.

"In spite of the additional recent studies addressing
changes involving persistent circulation patterns
represented by blocking, there appears to be significant
model-specific (and possibly blocking-definition-specific)
aspects of changes in blocking activity with increased CO,
in the various studies. For example, blocking can be
defined in terms of various pattern recognition schemes, or
as a certain geopotential height anomaly that persists for a
certain number of days, such that different threshold values
give different impressions of blocking in different models.
This makes it difficult to identify consistent changes in
blocking activity. However, since blocking involves stable
circulation patterns and leads to periods of greater weather
forecast skill, possible changes in blocking have
implications for future weather forecasting as well as
extreme weather events associated with blocking (see next

In experiments with the LMD model (Parey, 1994a) a
decrease in intermonthly temperature variability with
increased CO, was noted. However in that experiment only
the mean SST increases from the MPI (m) run were used,
so there was no possibility that ENSO variability could
play a role. Consistent with the decreased intermonthly
temperature variability, Parey (1994a,b) also noted changes
of persistent intermonthly circulation patterns, commonly
referred to as “blocking” (see Section 5.4.1), in the
Northern Hemisphere with increased CO,. In northern
winter in particular there were decreases of blocking
frequency over the Northern Hemisphere ocean regions.
Lupo et al. (1995) used an atmospheric model coupled to a

partly with the inclusion of ENSO-type variability in the

the earlier mixed-layer model, Campbell et al. (1995) noted
that the qualitative differences in variability described by
the first and second empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs)

differences in variability when CO, was doubled. These
two studies clearly show the importance of including

So-called “inherent” low-frequency variability in the
climate system on decadal and longer time-scales can, for
example, be induced by external sources such as volcanic
activity and perhaps solar activity, and from internal
sources such as alterations of the thermohaline circulation.
External sources of climate variability have not been
included in AOGCMs, but such models do have inherent
variability on long time-scales due to interaction between
the components of the coupled system. Since there are as
yet few multi-century AOGCM integrations, these studies
have focused less on possible changes to that variability
than on the consequences of long time-scale variability on
the manifestation of CO, climate change in the models.
Clarifying these issues should be possible as more multi-

"Decadal variability makes it more difficult to identify the
effects of increased CO, in the models. For example,
Cubasch et al. (1994b) showed that a series of transient
climate change experiments started from different initial
states in the control integration produced as a result of
decadal-scale variability somewhat different time evolutions
of surface air temperature change. Tokioka et al. (1995)
showed that decadal scale variability of sea ice volume in the
MRI (Japan) global AOGCM affected the rate of warming at
high latitudes in their transient CO, increase experiment. An
increase of sea ice in the control run (and transient run) due
to inherent decadal variability delays warming due to ice
albedo feedback in the transient CO, increase experiment.
However, ice albedo feedback effects can be influenced to a
certain extent by the particular features of each sea ice

decadal variability associated with this zonal mean

CO,-induced temperature change (warming in the
troposphere and cooling in the stratosphere) does have
inherent decadal-scale variability in the coupled models.
Principal component analysis of zonal mean temperature
shows some similarity of this pattern between the control

‘A common property of extremes is s that they refer to the

deviation of meteorological elements (or the combination of
seyeral elements) from the local normals. Several mechanisms
can be responsible for changes in local extremes: the
appearance of large-scale meteorological phenomena (e.g.,
blocking or El Nifio), an intensifying or weakening of either
large-scale systems (e.g., stormtracks) or small-scale features
such as convective storms, or a (relatively) small shift in
location of weather systems possessing sharp gradients, like
the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ). Prediction of
extremes originating from these three sources put different

Decadal and longer time-scale variability affect the

and patterns of zonal mean temperature change.
Multi-century variability in ENSO phenomena was in

Experiments with different model configurations
indicate that zonal mean mid-latitude intermonthly
temperature variability may be reduced, but there are
no consistent results in regard to changes in
persistent anomalies called “blocks”, one of the
contributors to intermonthly variability, since
different definitions of blocking have been used and
different models show different changes of
geographical patterns of blocking.

One study shows that intermonthly and interannual
variability differences between GCMs with a simple
mixed-layer and those coupled to a full ocean model
are larger than changes in either type of model due to
increased CO, alone, pointing to the importance of

note that for their 1000-year integrations with the GFDL
global coarse-grid AOGCM, the amplitude of ENSO-like
variability can fluctuate by a factor of two or more on
roughly a 50-year time-scale (Figure 6.28a). These
internally generated amplitude modulations are
substantially larger than the 20% decrease in mean
amplitude found for a quadrupling of CO, (Figure 6.28b)
and are reminiscent of the fluctuations in the amplitude of
the real ENSO observed in this century (Section 3.4.2).
Even using a 100-year sampling window (Figure 6.28b)
they found that the model’s internally generated
fluctuations of ENSO amplitude on a multi-century time-
scale can be comparable in magnitude to the long-term
change due to increased CO,. These studies point to the
complications that arise due to inherent long-time-scale
variability, and the difficulties that variability presents for
analysing changes of the climate system on almost all time-
scales due to increased CO,, as well as for detection of a

The main energy sources for mid-latitude depressions are
the temperature contrast between the cold polar regions and
the warmer sub-tropical conditions, and the release of
latent heat as water vapour condenses in the warm,
poleward moving, ascending air. Some GCMs show
(IPCC, 1990) that in a CO, enhanced atmosphere, the low-
level meridional temperature gradient will be reduced due
to positive feedbacks at higher latitudes, although most
coupled models simulate an increased temperature gradient
in the Southern Hemisphere. Most models predict
increased water vapour content in the warmer atmosphere.
However, at upper levels the tropics warm relative to high
latitudes due to the release of latent heat. It is difficult to

"6.5.3 Possible Changes in Daily Variability
Only a few modelling studies to date have analysed
changes in daily temperature and precipitation variability
(defined as variability between days) due to increased CO,.
One study used the LMD atmospheric GCM run, with
specified SSTs taken from a transient climate change
experiment with an AOGCM. Two series of three
experiments (control, doubled and tripled CO, with two
different model resolutions) showed a general decrease of
daily temperature variability with increased CO, in the
model (Parey, 1994a) along with an increase in mean
temperatures. A similar result for daily temperature
variability over a limited area was obtained from two
continuous 3.5 year-long climate simulations over
continental USA, one for present-day conditions and one
for conditions under doubled CO, concentration. These
were conducted with a regional climate model (RegCM),
on a 60 km grid, nested in a global GCM. A moderate
number of changes in daily temperature variability were
statistically significant, and the majority of these were
decreases, Clearest tendencies were decreases in the winter
in the central and northern Great Plains, in late summer and
late winter in the Great Lakes region, and in late winter in
the south-east (Mearns et al., 1995b). Cao et al. (1992)
analysed global changes in daily temperature variance in
the UKMO low resolution GCM for a doubling of CO,.
There is a reduction in variance in high latitudes in winter
where sea ice is replaced by open water, and a generally
insignificant reduction in middle latitudes over the oceans
and North America in winter, Elsewhere changes in
variance are small and of variable sign, though some
increases over the northern continents in summer are
statistically significant.

The formation of tropical cyclones depends upon a number
of factors, including sea surface temperatures (SSTs), the
vertical lapse rate of the atmosphere, vertical wind shear,
mid-tropospheric relative humidity, and the prior existence
of a centre of low-level cyclonic vorticity (Gray, 1979) so
predicting changes in a warming climate is not
straightforward. Though climate models can simulate some
of the aspects of tropical cyclone occurrence (Manabe and

Small changes in the mean climate or climate
variability can produce relatively large changes in the
frequency of extreme events; a small change in the
variability has a stronger effect than a similar change
in the mean.

A general warming tends to lead to an increase in
extremely high temperatures and a decrease in winter
days with extremely low temperatures.

Model studies that addressed daily variability
changes indicate a decrease of daily temperature
variability with increased CO, in certain regions,
with some increased daily precipitation variability
over a few areas such as north-west North America
in winter.

Several models suggest an increase in the
precipitation intensity, suggesting a possibility for
more extreme rainfall events. In some cases models
also predict more frequent or severe drought periods
in a warmer climate.

6.6.1 Regional Simulations by GCMs

In IPCC (1990), five regions were identified for analysis of
regional climate change simulation: Central North America
(CNA, 35~S0°N, 85—-105°W), South East Asia (SEA,
5-30°N, 70-105°E), Sahel (Africa) (SAH, 10-20°N,
20°W-40°E), Southern Europe (SEU, 35-50°N, 10
W-45°E) and Australia (AUS, 12-45°S, 110-155°E).
Output from different coupled model runs with dynamical
oceans for these regions was analysed by Cubasch ef al.
(1994a), Chakraborty et al. (1995a, b), Whetton ef al.
(1995) and Kittel et al. (1996), while analysis over the
Australian region from equilibrium simulations with
mixed-layer ocean models was performed by Whetton et
al. (1994). Results over two additional regions were
analysed by Raisanen (1995) for Northern Europe (NEU,
land areas north of 50°N and west of 60°R) and Li et al.
(1994) for East Asia (EAS, 15-60°N, 70-140°E). To
summarise the findings of these works, Figures. 6.32 (a—h)
show differences between region-average values at the
time of CO, doubling and for the control run, and
differences between control run averages and observations
(hereafter referred to as bias), for winter and summer
surface air temperature and precipitation. The biases are
presented as a reference for the interpretation of the
scenarios, because it can be generally expected that the
better the match between control run and observed climate,
the higher the confidence in simulated change scenarios.
The model runs are labelled d, g, m, x, p, qr, § and fin
Table 6.3 and the experiments do not include the effects of
aerosols and human-induced changes in surface
characteristics, which are likely to alter regional patterns of
temperature and precipitation change (e.g., Copeland et al.,
1995; also see Section 6.2 of this report). The models
employ different spatial resolutions and flux adjustments.

Statistical downscaling is a two-step process basically
consisting of (i) development of statistical relationships
between local climate variables (e.g., surface air
temperature and precipitation) and large-scale predictors;
and (ii) application of such relationships to the output of
GCM experiments to simulate local climate characteristics.
A range of statistical downscaling models has been
developed (Karl et al., 1990; Bardossy and Plate 1992;
Wilks 1992, Wilson et al., 1992, Von Storch ef al., 1993;
Gyalistras et al., 1994; Hughes and Guttorp 1994; Noguer
1994; Matyasowszky et al., 1995; Zorita et al., 1995;
Pleym and Karl 1996), mostly for USA, European and
Japanese locations, where better data for model calibration
are available. The main progress achieved in the last few
years has been the extension of many downscaling models
from monthly and seasonal to daily time-scales, which
allows the production of data more suitable for a broader
set of impact assessment models (e.g., agriculture or
hydrologic models) (Bardossy and Plate 1992; Wilks 1992;
Wilson et al., 1992; Matyasowszky et al., 1995; Pleym and
Karl 1996).

"When optimally calibrated, statistical downscaling
models have been quite successful in reproducing different
statistics of local surface climatology (e.g., Wilks, 1992;
Von Storch et al., 1993; Hughes and Guttorp, 1994;
Noguer, 1994; Zorita et al., 1995; Pleym and Karl, 1995).
Climate change scenarios have been generated through the
application of statistical downscaling models (Von Storch
et al., 1993; Gyalistras et al., 1994; Zorita et al., 1995;
Pleym and Karl; 1996). Confirming an early study by
Wigley et al. (1990), these new experiments showed that,
in complex physiographic settings, local temperature and
precipitation change scenarios generated using
downscaling methods were significantly different from,
and had a finer spatial scale structure than, those directly
interpolated from the driving GCMs. As an example,
Pleym and Karl (1996) indicated that the application of the
Climatological Prediction by Model Statistics (CPMS) to
output from a doubled CO, GCM equilibrium run
produced a decrease in simulated warming of several
degrees at different Norwegian locations compared to those
produced by the driving GCM.

"1 summary, several instances occurred in which
onal scenarios produced by all models agreed, at least
ign. In fact, regardless of whether flux correction was

srent for the sensitivities and the biases). However, the

that, while model agreement increases our confidence
le veracity of model responses, it does not necessarily
‘antee their correctness because of possible systematic
rs or deficiencies shared by all models. On the other

y climate sensitivity (see Chapter 5). Even though
els cannot exactly reproduce many details of today’s

In addition, different nesting techniques were used, from the
standard lateral boundary relaxation procedure (e.g., Giorgi
1990) to a newer spectral nesting procedure (Kida et al.,
1991) in which the GCM forces the low wavenumber
component of the fields throughout the regional domain and
the Reg@M calculates the high wavenumber component.

Overall, the models performed better at mid-latitudes
than in tropical regions.

The RegCM performance improved as the resolution
of the driving GCM increased, mostly because the
GCM simulation of large-scale circulation patterns
improved with increasing resolution.

Seasonal as well as diurnal temperature ranges were
simulated reasonably well.

An important problem in the validation of RegCMs
has been the lack of adequately dense observational
data, since RegCMs can capture the fine structure of
climate patterns. This problem is especially relevant
in mountainous areas, where often only a relatively
small number of high elevation stations are available.

The RegCM performance was critically affected by
the quality of the driving large-scale fields, and
tended to deteriorate when the models were driven by
GCM output, mostly because of the poorer quality of
the driving large-scale data compared to the analysis
data (e.g., position and intensity of storm tracks).

Compared to the driving GCMs, RegCMs generally
produced more realistic regional detail of surface
climate as forced by topography, large lake systems,
or narrow land masses. Examples of the additional
detailed produced by nested RegCMs in the
simulation of precipitation spatial patterns is given in
Figure 6.34a,b for the USA at 60 km grid point
spacing (Giorgi et al., 1994) and Figure 6.35a—c for
Great Britain at 50 km grid point spacing (Jones et

experiments also showed that RegCMs can both
improve and degrade aspects of regional climate
compared to the driving GCM runs, especially when
regionally-averaged (Table 6.5).

In summer, differences between RegCM and GCM
results were generally more marked than in winter due to
the greater importance of local processes (Giorgi et al.,
1994, Jones et al., 1996). For example, Hirakuchi and
Giorgi (1995) found that the representation of the Japanese
Islands in the RegCM substantially affected the simulation
of summer precipitation change over the region.
Comparison of the biases and 2 X CO,-induced
temperature and precipitation changes (Table 6.5) showed
that while the simulated temperature changes were
generally larger than the corresponding biases, the
precipitation changes were generally of the same order of,
or smaller than, the precipitation biases.

Of relevance for the simulation of regional climate
change is the development of a variable resolution global
model recently reported by Deque and Piedelievre (1995).
They compared three 10-year long runs of different
resolutions: T42 (equivalent resolution of ~300 km), T106
(equivalent resolution of ~120 km), and variable resolution
configuration centred over Europe (equivalent resolution of
about 50 km over Europe and 500 km at the antipodes),
with SSTs specified from observations for 1979 to 1988.
They demonstrated that the climate simulation over the
European region improved as the model resolution
increased, and that the variable resolution model produced
better results than the T106 model over Europe. When

For temperature, the differences between RegCM- and
GCM-simulated region-averaged change scenarios were in
the range of 0.1 to 1.4 °C. The largest differences occurred
in winter over the Great Lakes and Japan, because the lakes
and Japanese land masses were more finely resolved by the
RegCM than the GCM grids. For precipitation, the
differences between RegCM and GCM region-averaged
scenarios were more pronounced than for temperature, in
some instances by one order of magnitude or even in sign.
This was the result of the combined contributions of the
different resolution of surface forcing and atmospheric
circulations and, in some instances, the different behaviour
of model parametrizations designed for the fine and coarse
resolution models.

"experiments of Giorgi et al. (1994) and Jones et al. (1996),
respectively. In both cases (winter results), the large-scale
patterns of precipitation change were similar in the nested
and driving models, as they were mostly determined by
changes in large-scale circulations simulated by the GCM,
but the sub-regional detail of the scenarios in the GCM and
RegCM simulations was often quite different, not only in
magnitude but also in sign. For example, in the USA
RegCM experiment, the simulated precipitation increase
was largest in a relatively narrow region over the western
USA coastal areas, whereas in the GCM the areas of
pronounced precipitation increase extended farther inland.
This was due to the precipitation shadowing effect of the
coastal ranges which were represented by the high
resolution RegCM grid but were missed by the GCM grid.
Because of mountain shadowing, areas of negative change
were found east of the Rockies in the RegCM over regions
in which the driving GCM produced a positive change. A
similar rain shadowing effect in the Alpine and Pyrenees
regions was found in the experiment of Jones er al. (1996)
(Figure 6.37a, b). Topographical enhancement of the
precipitation change signal along the Italian Peninsula, the
British Isles and the Carpathian region also occurred.

Compared to the global scale changes due t to doubled
CO, concentration discussed in Section 6.2 of this report,
the changes at the 104 — 10° km? scale derived from
transient AOGCM runs and nested model runs are greater.
Considering all models, at the 104+ — 10° km? scale,
temperature changes due to CO, doubling varied between
+0.6°C and +7°C and precipitation changes varied between
-35% and + 50% of control run values, with a marked inter-
regional variability. Thus the inherent predictability of
climate diminishes with reduction in geographical scale.
The greatest model agreement in the simulated precipitation
change scenarios was found over the South East Asia
(~-1% to +30%), Northern Europe (~--9% to +16%),
Central North America (~-7% to +5%) and East Asia
(~+0.1 to +16%) regions in summer and Southern Europe
(~-2% to +29%)}, Northern Europe (~+5% to +25%) and
East Asia (~+0.5% to +18%) in winter. For temperature, the
greatest model agreement in simulated warming occurred
over Australia in summer (~+1.65°C to +2.5°C when
excluding one outlier) and the Sahel in winter (~+1.8°C to
+3.15°C when excluding one outlier). Regardless of
whether flux correction was used, the range of model
sensitivities was less than the range of biases, which
suggests that models produce regional sensitivities that are

more similar to each other than their biases.

Furthermore, the form (rain or snow) in which
precipitation reaches the Earth’s surface, is influenced by
the ice and liquid microphysical processes that generate the
precipitation. Hence, these processes affect the albedo of
land areas. This may be an important factor in positioning
and possibly moving the snow line (glacier borders).
Consequently, there may be a delicate feedback from
enhanced mid-latitude precipitation that is inferred to
accompany a warming climate.

The distinction between liquid and ice phases is also of
great importance for the inclusion of the commonly
observed feature of supercooled water, and hence
coexistence of liquid and ice particles in clouds. The
difference in saturation vapour pressure then makes the ice
particles grow at the expense of the liquid ones (the
Bergeron-Findeisen mechanism). This mechanism
enhances not only the in situ rate of release of
precipitation, but subsequently also that in layers beneath,
due to an enhanced coalescence effect as well.
Consequently, whether models consider the ice phase or
not has a pronounced impact on the resulting water content
throughout the cloud depth (Sundqvist, 1993), and hence
on the optical quality of the cloud.

Efforts to overcome this problem have focused on the
introduction of cloud microphysics into atmospheric GCMs
(e.g.. Sundqvist 1978; Le Treut and Li 1988; Smith, 1990;
Ose 1993; Senior and Mitchell, 1993; Fowler et al., 1996).
There are many difficulties. The basic microphysical
processes themselves are imperfectly understood. In
addition, the large spatial scale of GCM grid boxes means
that microphysical processes occur primarily within sub-
grid regions, such as individual cloud cells, whose
properties must be determined somehow. For example,
according to some microphysics parametrizations, the
conversion of small cloud droplets to raindrops occurs
when the local small-drop concentration exceeds some
threshold, but in a GCM the relevant local concentration is
not known; only the generally much smaller grid-box-mean
is available.

Regional modelling techniques, however, rely critically
on the GCM performance in simulating large-scale
circulation patterns at the regional scale, because these are
a primary input to both empirical and physically based
regional models. Although the regional performance of
coarse resolution GCMs is still somewhat poor, there are
indications that features such as positioning of storm track
and jet stream core are better simulated as the model
resolution increases (e.g., Hurrell et al., 1993). The latest
nested GCM/RegCM and variable resolution model
experiments, which employed relatively high resolution
GCMs and were run for long simulation times (up to 10
years) show an improved level of accuracy. Therefore, as a
new generation of higher resolution GCM simulations
become available, it is expected that the quality of
simulations with regional and local downscaling models
will also rapidly improve. In addition, the movement
towards coupling regional atmospheric models with
appropriately scaled ecological, hydrological, and
mesoscale ocean models will not only improve the
simulation of climatic sensitivity, but also provide
assessments of the joint response of the land surface,

The best-studied cloud dynamical processes are those
associated with deep convection, for which there are
several competing parametrizations. Recently there seems
to be some convergence of these towards a “mass flux”
formulation, although the relative merits of closures based
on buoyancy and moisture convergence are still being
actively debated (e.g., Tiedtke 1993). Convective clouds
themselves have only modest impacts on radiation, but
convective detrainment produces extensive stratiform
clouds, including cirrus and anvils, which drastically affect
the Earth’s radiation budget (e.g., Randall 1989).

Sea ice albedo needs better treatment and greater attention
should be given to the differences between processes in the
two hemispheres. One-dimensional models are currently
being used to investigate improvements in sea ice

"6.7.1.6 Improvements in land-surface processes/modelling
Many improvements in modelling land-surface (including
glaciers and ice sheets) processes have yet to make their
way into climate models (see Chapter 9 for a more
comprehensive discussion). These improvements involve
advances in both structure and function modelling. In
structure modelling, changes in land type (e.g., forest to
grass) are calculated in response to changes in climate. In
function modelling, changes in the function of a particular
land type (e.g., evapotranspiration/albedo) are predicted
with changes in climate. Land-surface process

With the recent increase in computer power, centennial-
millennial climate integrations (like the ones in Manabe
and Stouffer, 1993, Stouffer et al., 1994) will become
routine. It will be possible to examine transient changes in
climate variability associated with climate change. One of
the greatest challenges of the next decade will be for
coupled atmosphere-ocean models to duplicate
(statistically) the records found in the Greenland, Antarctic
and other ice cores. This would be done through the
statistical interpretation of an ensemble of integrations
under time-dependent Milankovitch cycle solar forcing.
Such simulations of past climates may provide the best
validation of coupled models used to predict future changes
in climate. However, this effort will need improved
reconstructions and understanding of past climate forcings
(CO), aerosols, etc.) as well as inferred temperature
changes.

"6.7.1.3 Flux adjustment and climate models

As discussed in Section 5.2.2, when an atmospheric model
is coupled to an ocean model and the implied heat and salt
transports between the two models are incompatible, a drift
in the climate system must occur (e.g., Weaver and
Hughes, 1996). This drift adversely affects both the
atmosphere and the ocean. The use of flux adjustments
may stabilise this drift, but they have the undesirable effect
of being physically unfounded and often of larger
magnitude (in places) than the climatological mean fluxes
(Manabe and Stouffer, 1988; Sausen et al., 1988). As
shown by ocean modelling studies (e.g., Weaver et al.,
1993), ocean models are capable of sustaining internal
modes of oscillation under a specified freshwater flux
boundary condition with thermal damping or a specified
thermal flux (Greatbatch and Zhang, 1995). In coupled
atmosphere-ocean simulations, any variability found when
flux adjustments are used is difficult to interpret.

Inclusion of sea ice dynamics -advection and
deformation — is necessary to account for the fresh water
provided by melting sea ice advected from the Arctic into
the Greenland and Norwegian Seas, and to reproduce
dynamic/thermodynamic feedback effects. For example,
experiments with stand-alone sea ice models (e.g., Lemke
et al., 1990; Hibler, 1984) have shown that thermodynamic-
only models are more sensitive to changes in thermal
forcing than those which include dynamics. Similarly,
recent GCM experiments by Pollard and Thompson (1994)
showed that inclusion of sea ice dynamics produced more
realistic ice extent and reduced a model’s CO,-induced
warming, particularly around Antarctica. Including a more
realistic dynamical formulation is the principal
improvement anticipated or being made in the sea ice
component of global climate models. Examples include the
use of the Flato and Hibler (1992) ice dynamics scheme in
models being developed at NCAR (Meehl and Washington,
1995; Washington and Meehl, 1996), GFDL, UKMO and
CCC, the use of Mellor and Kantha (1989) at MRI, and the
use of the more sophisticated (e.g., Hibler, 1979) ice
dynamics formulation in the ECHAM/OPYC and CSIRO
coupled models. However, as the treatment of sea ice
dynamics becomes more realistic, shortcomings in other
components of the coupled model, like wind and under-ice
current fields which drive ice motion, become more
important. Continued improvement is therefore an iterative
process.

systematically overestimated the incoming solar flux by

ascribe part of this error to neglect of absorption in the

improvement of the radiation schemes used in these models
will continue, especially by the inclusion of vertical

In the ocean, attempts have been made to model the
response of the carbon cycle to changes in atmospheric
CO, (e.g., Sarmiento et al., 1992). These are very difficult
to verify directly since the observed anomaly in stored
carbon in the ocean is very small. The models are
calibrated for observed uptake of carbon-14 from nuclear
testing. Alternatively one can model the natural carbon
cycle and perturb it with anomalous inputs. One such
model is described by Maier-Reimer (1993). Such models
require inclusion of a great many more processes such as
biological carbon fixation and remineralisation and
sedimentary interaction but also provide many more fields
amenable to observational verification. Currently, these
models also use highly simplified representations of
biological processes, often based on forcing nutrient
distributions at the surface to fit observations and
empirically determined ratios of elements in tissue.
Sensitivity studies such as those of Sarmiento and Orr
(1991) suggest that changes in biological productivity may
have a significant effect on carbon sequestration in the
ocean.

"Land-surface schemes used in GCMs are concerned with
modelling the fluxes of heat, water and momentum from a
given land cover type. There have been relatively few
attempts at modelling changes in vegetation type, even
though such changes may produce significant climatic
feedbacks (e.g., Henderson-Sellers and McGuffie, 1995).
Recent work at the Hadley Centre has attempted to include
these feedbacks by coupling a vegetation model to the
Hadley Centre GCM. The vegetation model predicts
vegetation properties (such as leaf area index, height and
canopy conductance) based on climate, soil carbon and
nitrogen contents, and the atmospheric CO, concentration.
The coupling to the GCM is two-way, with the GCM
providing climatic data to the vegetation model and the
vegetation model predicting the vegetation properties from
which the GCM land-surface parameters can be derived.
Such an approach allows mutually consistent climate-
vegetation equilibria to be computed and the vegetation
feedbacks to be diagnosed. There remains the outstanding
problem of modelling the dynamics of vegetation change,
which is very dependent on little-known rates of natural
and anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., fires, wind-blows,
etc.).

As already mentioned, progress in global carbon cycle
modelling is strongly dependent on progress in other areas
of global modelling. Ocean carbon cycle models depend on
the flow field of the underlying ocean general circulation
model (OGCM) to describe entrainment of chemical
species such as carbon into the thermocline. Terrestrial
ecosystem models require specification of heat, moisture
and radiative fluxes at the Earth’s surface. There are, of
course, areas beyond physical modelling which need
improvement. In the oceans these include better
experimental constraint of gas exchange coefficients in
actual conditions, understanding of processes controlling
isotopic fractionation, the partition of biological production
between dissolved and particulate forms and the above
mentioned treatment of biology.

"6.7.3 Climate Models Including Tropospheric Chemistry

The first AOGCM integrations to include, albeit very
crudely, the effects of tropospheric aerosols were
completed recently (Section 6.2.3). Only the so-called
direct radiative effects of the aerosols were included in a
simplistic way. This represents a first attempt to include
some effects of tropospheric chemistry in an AOGCM. To
date, no AOGCM experiments have studied the effects on
climate of changes in tropospheric chemistry, although
many institutions are planning such experiments in the near
future. The main problem is how to include large, complex
tropospheric chemistry models in already very large and
complex atmosphere-ocean models. Also, there is a great
deal of uncertainty in the estimation of future gas and
aerosol concentrations . Most short term efforts will be
dedicated to the inclusion of sulphates, dust and ozone into
AOGCMs. With regard to dust and sulphates it is important
to predict not only their distribution but also their size. For
ozone, it is important to predict not only the horizontal
distribution but, more importantly, the vertical distribution

"global mean sea [evel has risen 10-25 cm over the
last 100 years. This range is slightly higher than that
reported in IPCC (1990) (i.e., 10-20 cm). The higher
estimate results largely from the use of geodynamic
models for filtering out long-term vertical land
movements, as well as from the greater reliance on
the longest tide gauge records for estimating trends.

there has been no detectable acceleration of sea level
rise during this century. However, the average rise
during the present century is significantly higher than
the rate averaged over the last several thousand years,

global warming should, on average, increase the melt
rates of glaciers and ice caps, causing sea level to
rise, Observational data indicates that, globally, there
has been a general retreat of glaciers during this
century. Based on both observations and models,
recent analyses suggest that this enhanced melting
may have increased sea level by about 2-5 cm over
the last 100 years.

with respect to the Greenland ice sheet, a warmer
climate should increase the melt rates at the margins.
The increase in melting should dominate over any
increase in accumulation rates in the interior, causing
sea level to rise. However, observational evidence is
insufficient to say with any certainty whether the ice
sheet is currently in balance or has increased or
decreased in volume over the last 100 years.

with respect to the Antarctic ice sheet, a warmer
climate should increase the accumulation rates,
causing sea level to fall. Here, too, the observational
evidence is insufficient to say with any certainty
whether the ice sheet is currently in balance or has
increased or decreased in volume over the last 100
years.

it is unclear how changes in surface water or ground
water storage have affected sea level. Estimates vary
widely of the net effects of activities (largely
anthropogenic) such as dam construction and

Overall, the basic understanding of climate-sea level
relationships has not changed fundamentally since IPCC
(1990). The estimates of global sea level rise presented
here are lower than those presented in IPCC (1990), due
primarily to significantly lower estimates of global
temperature change which drive the projections of sea
level rise. Thus, if global warming were to occur more
rapidly than expected, the rate of sea level rise would
consequently be higher.

low estimates, using a range of parameter values based on
key model uncertainties, were made for IS92a (the

experiments suggest that the regional responses could

thus affect relative sea levels on local and regional scales.

past changes in radiative forcing, due to lags in the

reason, in model simulations sea level continues to rise

uncertainties — as reflected partly in intra-model
uncertainties in the choice of individual model parameter

A major source of uncertainty concerns the polar ice
sheets. Not only is there a lack of understanding of the
current mass balance, but there is also considerable
uncertainty regarding the possible dynamic responses on
time-scales of centuries. Concern has been expressed that
the West Antarctic Ice Sheet might “surge”, causing a rapid
rise in sea level. The current lack of knowledge regarding
the specific circumstances under which this might occur,
either in total or in part, limits the ability to quantify the
tisk, Nonetheless, the likelihood of a major sea level rise
by the year 2100 due to the collapse of the West Antarctic
Ice Sheet is considered low.

"for Scenario IS92a, sea level is projected to be about
50 cm higher than today by the year 2100, with a
range of uncertainty of 20-86 cm;

for the range of emission scenarios IS92a-f using
“best-estimate” model parameters, sea level is
projected to be 38-55 cm higher than today by the
year 2100;

the extreme range of projections, taking into account
both emission scenarios and model uncertainties, is
13-94 cm;

most of the projected rise in sea level is due to thermal
expansion, followed by increased melting of glaciers
and ice caps. On this time-scale, the contributions
made by the major ice sheets are relatively minor, but
are a major source of uncertainty.

All authors of recent global sea level change reviews
have used the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level
(PSMSL) data set (Spencer and Woodworth, 1993). A
central problem in identifying trends in eustatic sea level
from tide gauge data is how to account for vertical land
movements, which also affect relative sea level change as
measured by tide gauges. At the global scale, a major
source of vertical land movement derives from the
continuing readjustment of the Earth’s crust since the

Other authors have used geological data directly for sites
adjacent to tide gauges, a procedure which, in principle,
should accommodate other geological processes in addition
to post-glacial rebound (e.g., Gornitz and Lebedeff, 1987).
This sort of analysis has been conducted for the North Sea
region of Europe, which has an extensive tide gauge and
geological sea level data set, by Shennan and Woodworth
(1992). Earlier analyses (e.g., Barnett, 1984) simply
averaged tide gauge records on the implicit assumption that
the effects of land movements would somehow average out.
It is interesting that the results of most of these studies are
within the range 1-2 mm/year, with some bias towards the

lower end of the range (see Gornitz, 1995a, for a review).

"Gornitz (1995a) has also pointed out that estimates using
the longest records obtain the highest values, closer to 2
mm/year than 1 mm/year, and that correction for post-
glacial rebound by means of the Peltier models gives
higher values for the trend than those analyses which
employed nearby geological data values directly. This is a
result of the post-glacial rebound models producing smaller
extrapolated sea level trends into the present day than the
linear fit to nearby geological data procedure such as
Gornitz and colleagues have employed, Hence, the
corrected tide gauge trends using the post-glacial rebound
models will be higher than those using the nearby
geological observations. In the latter case, problems could

"In terms of environmental and social consequences, sea
level rise is arguably one of the most important potential
impacts of global climate change. As in IPCC (1990), the
primary purpose of this chapter is to assess what is known
regarding how sea level has changed in the past and could
change in the future, on time-scales of decades to centuries.
The chapter begins by reviewing the evidence for trends in
sea level over the past 100 years, based on tide gauge
records. Next, the factors that could contribute to sea level
change ~ namely, changes related to oceanic thermal
expansion, glaciers and small ice caps, the large ice sheets
of Greenland and Antarctica, and the possible changes in
land-surface water and ground water storage — are
examined. Future projections of global mean sea level rise
are then made, on the basis of scenarios of future
greenhouse gas emissions and projections of future global
warming. The important factors that may cause such
changes in sea level to vary spatially and temporally are
considered, including geological, geophysical and dynamic
effects.

"glacial retreat marking the end of the last ice age. This
“post-glacial rebound” (PGR) is the only globally coherent
geological contribution to long-term sea level change about
which we possess detailed understanding. Since IPCC
(1990), Douglas (1991) has applied post-glacial rebound
corrections from the ICE-3G model of Tushingham and
Peltier (1991) to the observed tide gauge data (avoiding
tide gauge records in areas of converging tectonic plates,
since such processes are not represented by the PGR
model) and produced a highly consistent set of long-term
sea level trends. The value for the mean rate of sea level
rise that he obtained from a global set of 21 such stations in
nine oceanic regions with an average record length of 76
years during the period 1880-1980 was 1.8 + 0.1 mm/year.
Geodynamic models of post-glacial rebound have also
been employed in global analyses by Peltier and
Tushingham (1989, 1991) and Trupin and Wahr (1990),
who obtained similar results. Uncertainties in global sea
level trends determined from PGR models may include a
range of uncertainty of approximately 0.5 mm/year,
depending on the Earth structure parametrization employed
by the model (Mitrovica and Davis, 1995).

The main difficulties in determining a more robust
estimate for the sea level trends (let alone acceleration) are
the unequal geographical distribution of historical tide
gauge data and the considerable amount of typically
decadal variability present in all records. The former is
slowly being rectified with the development of a near-
global tide gauge network (GLOSS) and by means of
satellite radar altimetry (e.g., TOPEX/POSEIDON).

~ Peltier and Tushingham (1989) also commented that the
sea level trends depend strongly on the choice of minimum
record length and on the particular time interval selected.
Their sea level rise estimates, based on tide gauge record
lengths greater than 50 years, tended to lie closer to 2
mm/yr than those based on shorter record lengths. Six of
the longest tide gauge records (unadjusted for post-glacial
rebound or other geological effects) for each continent are
shown in Figure 7.1.

"The evidence, or lack of it, for sea level accelerations
over the past century depends critically on a small number
of long tide gauge records which is unlikely to be
supplemented significantly in the future. Nevertheless, the
search for old records (or “data archaeology”) can be
particularly rewarding when such data are found. For
example, Maul and Martin (1993) recently extended the
Key West, Florida data set back to 1846 and demonstrated
that no significant acceleration of sea level rise has
occurred since that time.

In summary, the best estimate based on recent analyses
is that sea level has risen about 18 cm over the last 100
years, with a range of uncertainty of 10-25 cm —
notwithstanding the fact that some authors (e.g., Gréger
and Plag, 1993; Pirazzoli, 1993) maintain that a global
figure for sea level rise cannot be estimated reliably,
stressing the limitations of the available data set. This
range is consistent with the 10-20 cm range given in IPCC
(1990). As geodynamic models and measurements of
vertical land movements become more reliable, confidence
in such estimates will increase.

"Archaeological and geological data suggest that global sea
levels have probably varied within a range of no more than a
few tens of centimetres over the past two millennia
(Flemming, 1969, 1993, Pirazzoli, 1977; Flemming and
Webb, 1986; Hofstede, 1991; Tanner, 1992; Varekamp et
al., 1992). The 10-25 cm rise over the past 100 years implies
a comparatively recent acceleration in the rate of sea level
change (Gornitz and Seeber, 1990; Shennan and
Woodworth, 1992; Gornitz, 1995b). However, the exact
timing of the onset of this acceleration remains uncertain.
The conclusions given in Woodworth (1990), Gornitz and
Solow (1991), and Douglas (1992) imply’ that the
acceleration probably began before the 1850s. But data for
the pre-instrumental period is sparse, at best. There is as yet
no evidence for any, acceleration of sea level rise this century
(Woodworth, 1990; Gornitz and Solow, 1991; Douglas,
1992), nor would any necessarily be expected from the
observed climate change to date. Small accelerations have
been suggested over the past two or three centuries in
European sea level data (Mérner, 1973; Ekman, 1988;
Woodworth, 1990; Gornitz and Solow, 1991).

Atmospheric and oceanic dynamical processes account
for a large fraction of the interannual and interdecadal
variability. These fluctuations, 1-2 years to a decade in
duration and coherent over long distances, reflect changes
in temperature and salinity, currents, and coupled oceanic-
atmospheric forcing, such as the El Nifio-Southern
Oscillation phenomenon in the Pacific Ocean (Komar and
Enfield, 1987), or the North Atlantic Oscillation in the
North Atlantic Ocean (Maul and Hanson, 1991). The
limitations imposed by large interannual sea level changes
in determining reliable sea level trends and accelerations
have been particularly emphasised by Douglas (1992) and
demonstrated by Sturges (1987) and Sturges and Hong
(1995). The understanding of such interannual processes
has been an aim of large international programmes such as
the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere (TOGA) project
and the. World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE),
and will continue to be the object of research based on the
results of a Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS). As
ocean modelling becomes more detailed, and as surface
and deep ocean observations become more routine,
increased understanding of interannual processes will
result, leading to an improved estimate of any underlying
long-term trend and acceleration.

An important feedback mechanism between thermal
expansion and increased sea level caused by increased
melting of ice is linked to the above processes. Increased
fresh water fluxes to the ocean have an impact on density
stratification and thereby on the depths of convection of the
surface waters. This, in turn, affects the circulation of the
interior of the ocean and thus the rates of thermal
expansion for the different nt layers « of the world ocean.

Marked changes in salinity c¢ can occur at the regional
scale and modify sea water density and volume. In the
short term, these effects are relatively minor at the global
scale. However, the main anomalous buoyancy sources are
located at high latitudes where sea water finds an effective
pathway from the surface to the deeper layers of the ocean.
Thus, in the longer term, regional salinity changes can
affect the whole ocean circulation, the distribution of heat
and oceanic expansion.

"More generally, because of very complex physics, there
are other important regional variations and time lags
involved in sea level rise by thermal expansion. The
redistribution of buoyancy from source regions to other
parts of the oceans involves large-scale waves and
transport by currents. The adjustment processes are very
slow, because they are related to the internal modes of heat
and mass redistribution within the ocean. Consequently, a
sea level rise due to thermal heating must be out of
equilibrium, especially for rapid climate change. This
implies that the ocean will rise more rapidly in some areas
than in other areas.

"hydrographic surveys are beginning to indicate large-scale,
coherent changes in sub-surface ocean temperatures (see
Chapter 3.2.4 for details). Estimates of the thermal
expansion associated with some of these observed ocean
temperature changes are similar in magnitude to changes in
nearby sea level records (Roemmich, 1992; Salinger et al.,
1996). However, these estimates are still regionally
specific. Such observational consistency between thermal
expansion and sea level observations will improve in the
near future with the availability of the new WOCE data

temperature and salinity have to be recorded over the water

"The advantage of the simpler upwelling diffusion
climate models is that they are computationally efficient so
that the sensitivity of results to model parameters and to
uncertainties in greenhouse gas emissions can easily be
examined. For example, the projections of oceanic thermal
expansion made by IPCC (1990) (Warrick and Oerlemans,
1990) were derived with the use of the simple upwelling
diffusion-energy balance climate model of Wigley and
Raper (1987, 1993). This model represents the vertical
profile of area-averaged ocean temperature, which changes
in response to changes in radiative forcing at the surface.
Thermal expansion of sea water, and thus sea level change,
is diagnosed from the temperature profiles through the use
of expansion coefficients. For the periad 1880 to 1990, the
estimated range of sea level rise due to thermal expansion
using this model is about 3.1 cm to 5.7 cm, with a best
estimate of 4.3 cm (consistent with model parameters
discussed in Chapter 6 and in Section 7.5.2), when the
model is forced with the estimated radiative forcing
changes from increases in greenhouse concentrations over
the same period. A slightly more complex, 2-dimensional
variant of this kind of model, using a prescribed ocean
circulation and surface forcing based on observed sea
surface temperature (de Wolde et al., 1995), leads to
similar values: 2.2 cm to 5.1 cm with a best estimate 3.5

however, is that they do not realistically represent the

Subduction models, while still relatively simple,
introduce heat into the ocean by advection along isopycnal
(constant density) surfaces. Such a model has been
developed by Church et al. (1991). In this model, the
estimates of the magnitude of global thermal expansion are
independent of assumptions regarding the magnitudes of
eddy diffusivity. Furthermore, since this model is three-
dimensional, it provides information on the regional
differences in sea level change adjustments. Church et al.
(1991) demonstrate a small dependence of the mean sea
level rise on the spatial distribution of warming, for a given
global mean temperature rise. With this model, Church et
al. (1991) obtain a sea level rise due to thermal expansion
of about 6.9 cm over the last one hundred years. The major
disadvantage of this model is that it does not predict
surface temperature changes, and it also ignores deep water
formation and associated changes in convective heat
fluxes.

predictability. The initial conditions for AOGCMs are
never fully known. This alone would be sufficient to
prevent a prediction of the state of the ocean over several
decades. To estimate the error that stems from this
uncertainty, Cubasch et al. (1994a) carried out four 50-year
integrations with the MPI coupled model. In all the
experiments the greenhouse gas forcing started with
conditions in 1986 and then followed the IPCC (1990)
Scenario A. The only differences were in the initial
conditions of the atmosphere and ocean. The decadal
means of global warming and sea level rise showed large
differences. The global mean sea level rise due to thermal
expansion was 4.2 cm in the last years of integration, but in
many regions of the world ocean, the local mean response
had about the same size as two standard deviations of the
decadal means between the runs. These problems, and
others like the consequences of differences in spin-up
techniques, obviously limit the reliability of the
conclusions presently resulting from these coupled ocean-

AOGCMs adequately represent the processes governing
water mass formation and thus the penetration of surface

suffer from important unsolved problems to which thermal
expansion calculations are particularly sensitive. First,
there is the “cold start” problem. Neglecting past changes
in greenhouse gas forcing before running scenarios of
future forcing changes in AOGCMs leads to significant
underestimation of both future warming and sea level rise
due to thermal expansion of sea water. For example,
Cubasch er al. (1994a) showed that starting the MPI
coupled model from 1935 instead of 1985, but using the
same future forcing scenario beyond 1985, leads to
estimates of 7 cm instead of 4 cm for thermal expansion for
the period 1985-2050. The GFDL model shows a much
shorter time constant (about 10 years) compared to the MPI

The amount of land ice on Earth has fluctuated as the

numerous mountain glaciers, ice fields and ice caps of the
world, exclusive of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets
(Figure 7.2), and their past and future contributions to
changes in sea level. The potential contributions of glaciers
and ice caps are not insignificant because the rates of ice
accumulation and loss are more intense than those on the
huge ice sheets.

glacier mass balances using climatological data, with the
result that the calculated loss of water to the sea may be

internal accumulation have been developed for mountain
glaciers (Trabant and Mayo, 1985) and for Arctic glaciers
including Greenland (e.g., Pfeffer et al., 1991; Reeh, 1991).

consequence of global warming. Although observational
data are still too sparse and regionally specific to allow
global estimates of thermal expansion, analyses of recent

surface ocean temperatures. Thermal expansion can also be
predicted from a range of models, from simple to very
complex. Based on model experiments, the estimated rise
in sea level due to thermal expansion over the last 100
years lies within the range 2-7 cm.

"The change in mass of these glaciers can be expressed as
the sum of the mass balance at the surface (the difference
between accumulation and loss, which can be positive or
negative), plus the meltwater that is refrozen internally
(internal accumulation), minus any iceberg calving flux.
The change in mass of ice on land results in a change in sea
level of opposite sign. The complexity stems from the fact
that the surface mass balance, internal accumulation,
iceberg calving flux, as well as the area and shape of the
ice masses, are functions of time. The surface balance can
be measured in a straightforward way, although it is a
labour-intensive process (Ostrem and Brugman, 1991). It
can also be inferred, using hydrometeorological or
climatological models, as the difference between snow
accumulation (sometimes equated to winter precipitation)
and snow/ice melt (often modelled using temperature or
runoff as proxy); both terms are required for accurate
modelling, including their seasonal differences.

Internal accumulation and iceberg calving can be safely
ignored in many regions, such as in much of Europe. In
this case, conventional surface observations, or modelled
relations, of snow accumulation and melt rates yield
sufficient information for predicting volume changes as a
result of climate change. In some areas of significant
glacier cover, such as in the Arctic, all terms (and their

Thinning of glaciers since the mid-19th century has been

example, see Figure 7.3). This long-term ice loss has
considerable spatial and short-term variability. For
instance, negative mass balances and rapid thinning have
been observed in this century in the Alps (Haeberli and
Hoelzle, 1995) and in south-central Alaska but not in the
Canadian Arctic (Fisher and Koerner, 1994). Significant
positive spatial correlations in annual mass balances are
found between some glacierised regions, such as

For the Greenland ice sheet, early estimates (Bauer,
1968) suggested a negative balance. More recently, several
mass balance studies of a more local nature have been
carried out. Kostecka and Whillans (1988) compared mass
balance with ice velocity measurements along two
transects (International Glaciological expedition to
Greenland [EGIG] traverse [71°N] and the Ohio State
University traverse [65°N]). Results suggest no significant
changes in ice thickness, with perhaps a very slight
thickening at the Ohio State University traverse (0.06 +
0.08 m/yr). For the Dye 3 station (65°N, 43.5°W) Reeh and
Gundestrup (1986) obtain a change in ice thickness of 0.03
+ 0.06 m/yr, i.e., not significantly different from zero.

"For the Antarctic ice sheet, two studies attempted to
compare accumulation with mass flux across grounding
lines. Budd and Smith (1985) used existing ice velocity
measurements to estimate outflow from the grounded ice.
They concluded that “...the total influx over the Antarctic
ice sheet of about 2000 km3/yr (= 1800 X 10!? kg/yr) is
probably nearly balanced by the outflow with a
discrepancy most likely in the range of 0 to +20%”.
Bentley and Giovinetto (1991) made an assessment of the
imbalance for drainage basins for which a reasonable
amount of data was available. Most basins seem to have a
positive balance. Extrapolating the results to the entire

Recent attempts to measure the surface elevation include
the use of satellite radar altimetry. The results are still
controversial. Zwally et al. (1989) used satellite radar
altimetry to estimate the change in surface elevation of the
Greenland ice sheet south of 72°N (excluding the margins).
For the period 1978-1985, they found an ice thickening
rate of 0.23 + 0.04 m/yr which implied a 25% to 45%
positive balance for that period. Douglas et al. (1990)
criticised this result on the basis of inadequate calibration
of satellite orbits, but Zwally et al. (1990) obtained a
similar result using orbits that were consistently calculated
and adjusted to a common ocean reference. Lingle et al.
(1991) used this method in the ablation zone, but due to
errors in the altimetry on these sloping and undulating
margins, the thickness-change results are not significantly
different from zero. Ice sheet modelling by Huybrechts
(1994) suggests an average thickening south of 72°N, in
agreement with Zwally’s results but somewhat smaller in

Using a modelling approach, Huybrechts (1990, 1994)
has carried out long integrations with a fairly
comprehensive model of the Antarctic and Greenland ice
sheets. This model solves the coupled mechanic and
thermodynamic equations and includes ice shelves. The
forcing follows a specified temperature and a sea level
history. Simple parametrizations are used for the
generation of the mass balance fields from a uniform
temperature signal, which is taken from the Vostok ice
core, and there. is no direct effect of insolation variations on
the mass balance. From the model, the Antarctic ice sheet
shows a very strong response to the glacial-interglacial
transition, as shown in Figure 7.5. This is mainly a
response to the rise in-sea level at that time and involves a
substantial shrinkage of the West Antarctic ice sheet. The
Greenland ice sheet show a much weaker response, except
in the beginning of the integration (which must be
considered as transient effects). The Greenland ice sheet
responds solely to the temperature signal (sea level has
very little effect), With respect to current mass balance,
these model simulations suggest that the contribution of the
Greenland ice sheet to sea level rise may be close to zero,
while that of the Antarctic ice sheet may be positive.

For Greenland, a number of estimates of the sensitivity

energy balance models). The most studied quantity is the
change in mean specific (surface) balance for a uniform

information for predictions of sea level change. This is an
indication that confidence in such quantification is still
low. Partly because ice accumulation at the surface of ice
sheets is very slow, small absolute errors (and regional-
scale precipitation patterns from control runs of GCMs are
often significantly different from observed climate) come
out as large relative errors. Even GCMs which fare well on
average are not entirely reliable for polar climate studies
(Genthon, 1994). Nevertheless, there have been significant
improvements in recent years, mainly associated with
increased resolution (Simmonds, 1990; Budd and
Simmonds, 1991; Genthon, 1994). It is expected that more
credible results from AOGCMs will be available in the

Antarctic ice sheet is by calving of icebergs, but the
various estimates of this flux differ. The most serious
problem is that iceberg breakoff may be very episodic; in
some areas the mean time between major calving events
may be >100 years, so that historical data are of limited
use. Also, the method of measuring the discharge using
observations of current iceberg distributions is limited by
uncertainty regarding mean lifetimes of icebergs of

fact that empirical constants/parameters used in the
different methods come mostly from the same data sets.
The various approaches have some weak points in common
as well (treatment of meltwater infiltration and refreezing,
and of albedo). Also, accumulation rates are treated in the
same way in all studies: either fixed, or changed in
proportion to the saturation vapour pressure of the
overlying air. However, there is little physical reason to
believe that the precipitation pattern over Greenland is
invariant for climate change. In fact, some studies using
current information (Bromwich et al., 1993; Bromwich,
1995) or results from ice cores (Kapsner et al., 1995)
suggest that there is little relation between temperature and
precipitation changes over Greenland during the Holocene

"For the Antarctic ice sheet, possible changes in

been studied using regression techniques (e.g., Muszynski

problem here is the dependence within the set of predictors
that are used in a multiple regression. Broadly speaking,
when going from the margin of the ice sheet to the interior,
the accumulation rate changes by an order of magnitude,
typically from 0.4 m/yr to 0.04 m/yr (expressed as water-
equivalent). This is partly due to lower air temperature, but
also to other factors (e.g., distance to moisture source,
topographic effects). So the sensitivity of the accumulation
rate to temperature (identified as the regression coefficient
for temperature) depends on the choice of the other
predictors. This explains the large difference in the results
of Muszynski and Birchfield (1985) and Fortuin and

An extensive sensitivity study with a two-dimensional
(vertical plane) meteorological model was conducted by
Fortuin and Oerlemans (1992). In this model, the zonal
mean distribution of temperature and precipitation is
calculated with a four-layer dynamic model, which
includes a radiation scheme. For a uniform warming, this
model predicts a higher accumulation rate and a stronger
evaporation in the coastal regions than in the interior. The
net effect over the grounded ice is an increase in the mass
balance corresponding to a -0.27 mm/yr sea level change
for a 1°C warming. This value is slightly less than the

Surface reservoir and lake storage. The filling of

balance of precipitation and evaporation, and also
respond to changes in upstream runoff which may be
affected by human action. Some of the world’s large

storage to past sea level change is about —19 cm to +37 cm

the observed sea level rise (10-25 cm). The major source
of uncertainty relates to the current mass balance of the

thermohaline circulation with global warming, effects that
are suggested by recent coupled ocean-atmosphere model
experiments (Cubasch ef al., 1992; Manabe and Stouffer,

two sets of projections for each greenhouse gas emission

in response to the changing emissions of their precursors

aerosol concentrations are held constant at 1990 levels for
the purpose of sensitivity analyses. The latter set is
included because of the large uncertainties in future aerosol
forcing, related both to uncertainties in future emission
changes and their consequent effects on radiative forcing
change. Projections corresponding to “aerosols constant at

to a situation where global emissions of aerosol precursors
remain similar to 1990 levels.

Changes in the volume of glaciers and ice caps were
estimated with a revised version of the global glacier
model used in IPCC (1990) (Wigley and Raper, 1995). In
the revised model, the driving force for melting (or change
in ice volume) is the difference between the ice volume and
the “equilibrium” value of the ice volume, the latter itself
being a function of temperature change. The model has a
small number of parameters and is tuned against
observationally based estimates of the glacier volume
change over the period 1900 to 1961. The model
incorporates a range of characteristic response times due to
glacier dynamics; this is necessary because projections are
needed for the next 100 years, which is of the same order
of magnitude as real glacier response times. The model is
regionally disaggregated to take into account the variations
in the altitudinal range of the world’s glaciers and their
response times, so that as the more “sensitive” glaciers
begin to. disappear during model simulations, the average
characteristic response time and other model parameters
values are altered, giving a non-linear response of glacier
melt to temperature change. At the initial year of the
simulation (1880), it is assumed that the world’s glaciers
are in steady-state with respect to the prevailing climate
and that they contain a volume equal to 30 cm in sea level
equivalent.

To indicate the sensitivity of the projections to
assumptions concerning aerosols, Figure 7.7 (dashed
curves) shows results with aerosol concentrations held
constant at 1990 levels: the [S92a projections at the year
2100 are about 10% higher than the projections that
include aerosol changes. The inclusion of aerosol effects
tends to lower the estimated changes in radiative forcing,
compared to those due to greenhouse gases alone, both for
the past and the future (see Chapters 2 and 6). This directly
lowers the heating and consequent thermal expansion of
the oceans, as well as reducing the surface temperature
changes that drive changes in the glaciers and ice sheets.

The 1990-2100 changes in sea level for scenarios IS92a-f,
with “best-estimate” model parameters, are shown in
Figure 7.6 (a). The range of the projections shown is
determined by the range of future emissions under the IS92
scenarios and does not include the additional uncertainties
in model parameter values. For the first decades of the
projection period, the choice of emission scenario has little
effect on the rate of sea level rise; even by the year 2050,
the range of projected sea level rise is still relatively small,
18-21 cm. This is a consequence of lags in the climate
system, caused primarily by the thermal inertia of the
ocean, and of the continuing response of the ocean, climate
and ice masses to past changes in radiative forcing and
temperature. In the short term (i.e., several decades), future
sea level rise is largely determined by past emissions of
greenhouse gases. During the second half of the next
century, however, the curves diverge noticeably. By the
year 2100, the uncertainty introduced by the emission
scenarios gives a range of sea level rise of 38-55 cm. The
effect of holding aerosol amounts constant at 1990 levels is
to increase the range of projected sea level rise based on
the six [S92 scenarios, as shown in Figure 7.6 (b).

The “best estimate” for JS92a is that sea level will rise by
49 cm by the year 2100, with a range of uncertainty of
20-86 cm. These projections of future sea level rise are
lower than those presented in IPCC (1990). The differences
are due primarily to the lower temperature projections, the
inclusion of a slow-down of the thermohaline circulation,
and changes to the glacier model. However, the basic
understanding of climate-sea level relationships has not
changed fundamentally since IPCC (1990). Thus, if future
temperature change is higher than expected, sea level rise
will also be higher.

In Section 7.5.2 above, a single set of integrated climate and
ice-melt models was chosen to maximise consistency with
the various chapters of this report. Consistency was
achieved in three ways. First, the same simple climate
model that was used to estimate oceanic thermal expansion
was also used to estimate global-mean temperature change,
thus ensuring consistency between Chapters 6 and 7.
Second, this climate model was demonstrated to emulate
both the temperature and thermal expansion predictions of
certain AOGCMs, selected during the IPCC process as the
standard for gauging the acceptability of a simple climate
model as the means for examining the effects of various
IPCC emission scenarios. Third, the land-ocean temperature
differences, the changes in thermohaline circulation, and the
magnitude of temperature changes in polar regions — as well
as the global temperature and thermal expansion predictions
~ produced by the AOGCMS, were explicitly taken into
account in using this set of models. Largely because of this
consistency, these model results are promulgated as the
IPCC sea level rise projections for the purposes of the

In general, the projections of future sea-level rise from this
set of models are substantially lower than the revised IPCC
projections presented in Section 7.5.2 for the identical set
of 1892 forcing scenarios. To illustrate, Figure 7.10 shows
the highest and lowest projections of sea level rise for the
period 1990~2100, along with the “best estimates” for

projection in Section 7.5.2. Possible explanations for the
differences are given below. It should also be noted that,
unlike Section 7.5.2, the value of the climate sensitivity
(2.2°C) did not vary for the high and low projections,
resulting in a smaller range of estimates than would

For glaciers and ice caps, a range of sensitivity to
climate change was used (from Oerlemans and Fortuin,
1992). The value of the sensitivity varies latitudinally,
depending on the present-day precipitation rate, since
glaciers in wetter regions are more sensitive than those in
drier regions. These sensitivity values are time-independent
and do not take into account the dynamic response of
glaciers in a changing climate. Since the dynamic response
may be very different for individual glaciers, it is uncertain
how such an averaged dynamic behaviour should be
included. However, it is assumed that on the time-scales
considered here, the warming associated with the lowering
of the ice surface and the decrease of the area due to the
retreat of the glacier terminus will have a counterbalancing
effect on the sensitivity values. The model calculations
start in'1990. On the assumption that most glaciers are not
in equilibrium with the present climate, a constant trend of
0.5 mm/yr is included (consistent with observations and the
global glacier model results in Section 7.5.2).

For predicting temperature changes and thermal expansion,
a simple two-dimensional energy-balance climate model
having latitudinal and seasonal resolution was used
(Bintanja, 1995; Bintanja and Oerlemans, 1995; de Wolde
et al., 1995). This zonal-mean model has a climate
sensitivity of approximately 2.2°C, and so would be
expected to give lower sea-level changes than the best
estimates described above (which use a sensitivity of
2.5°C). The model was first calibrated against the seasonal
cycle of present-day observations of surface air
temperature, ocean temperature (Levitus, 1982), and snow
and sea-ice cover. Radiative forcing values for 1765,
referenced to 1990 (see Section 6.3.2), were then used to
obtain the initial state, after which the model was
integrated over the period 1765-2100. Using comparable
forcings, the thermal expansion results of this model have
been compared to several coupled GCM results and found
to be in reasonable agreement. The latitudinally and
seasonally varying changes in the surface air temperature
from the model were used to determine the sea level
contributions from the glacier and ice sheet models.

For thermal expansion, the contribution to sea-level rise
by 2100 is 15 cm, about half of that obtained by the simple
climate model used in Section 7.5.2. This lower thermal
expansion, however, can be largely explained by two
factors. First, the climate sensitivity of the climate model is
lower (2.2°C, as compared to 2.5°C used for the best-
estimate projections in Section 7.5.2). Second, the
thermohaline circulation is represented differently by the
two models, For the revised IPCC projections in Section
7.5.2, the simple climate model simulates the slow-down of
the thermohaline circulation with global warming, in
accordance with most recent coupled GCM results (see
Section 6.3), which allows greater warming at depth and
larger thermal expansion. In the zonal-mean model used
here, the thermohaline circulation was kept constant, with
comparatively less thermal expansion. Other possible
explanations for the differences in thermal explanation

have yet to be examined fully.

both the dynamic Antarctic and Greenland models used
here, however, the portion of sea level change attributed to
dynamic changes was found to be minor on this time-scale
and does not appear to account for much of the inter-model
differences. Rather, the inter-model differences are due
largely to three other factors. First, the Antarctic
temperature forcings were very different. For the revised
IPCC projections, the global-mean temperature change was
used (consistent with recent AOGCM results which show
little enhancement of temperature changes for Antarctica).
In contrast, the dynamic ice sheet model used here was
forced with enhanced polar temperature changes obtained
by the two-dimensional climate model. Second, the ice-
sheet sensitivity value used for the revised IPCC
projections was considerably lower, since it included a
term for the possible instability of the West Antarctic ice
sheet. Third, the revised IPCC projections included an
extrapolation of an assumed 1880 negative mass balance (a
relatively small effect) throughout the simulated period .

One such transient experiment involved the use of an
AOGCM in which the CO, concentration was increased by
1%/yr until it doubled, after 70 years (e.g., Manabe and
Stouffer, 1993, 1994). Although the concentration was

thermal expansion alone. At the end of five hundred years,
sea level had risen one metre due to thermal expansion and
was still rising, even though temperature changes had

Given our present knowledge, it is clear that while the
ice sheet has had a very dynamic history, estimating the
likelihood of a collapse during the next century is not yet
possible. If collapse occurs, it will probably be due more to
climate changes of the last 10,000 years rather than to
greenhouse-induced warming. Nonetheless, such a
collapse, once initiated, would be irreversible. Our
ignorance of the specific circumstances under which West
Antarctica might collapse limits the ability to quantify the
risk of such an event occurring, either in total or in part, in
the next 100 to 1000 years.

"The West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is a marine ice sheet
— it rests on a bed well below sea level. It has long been
argued (Weertman, 1974) that the WAIS may be inherently
unstable because the interior, grounded ice (inland ice)
cannot respond fast enough to changes in thickness of the
floating portions at their junction, the grounding line. It has
also been argued (Thomas, 1973, 1985) that the large
abutting ice shelves create “back pressure” which prevents
the collapse of the inland ice, such that ice shelf thinning or
break-up could cause the grounded ice to “surge” — another
critical element contributing to marine ice sheet instability.

"Recent theoretical work is equivocal. Several recent
treatments support the idea that the transition zone between
the grounded and floating ice does not act as a source of
instability (Van der Veen, 1985; Herterich, 1987; Barcillon
and MacAyeal, 1993, Lestingant, 1994). On the other hand,
there is also support for the idea of instability, which may
include the concept of ice shelf buttressing at the
grounding line (NASA, 1991). A recent theoretical
development that suggests dramatic instability of a marine
ice sheet is the so-called “binge-purge” cycle put forward
to explain the massive outpourings of icebergs (Heinrich
events) from Northern Hemisphere ice sheets during the
last ice age (Alley and MacAyeal, 1994; MacAyeal, 1994).

"These notions are changing. It is now known that the
activity of the WAIS is dominated by fast-flowing, wet-
based ice streams whose characteristics blend gradually
into those of the floating ice shelves and whose response
times to changes in the grounding line appear to be very
rapid (Alley and Whillans, 1991). However, the effects of
these dynamic ice streams on the stability of the WAIS is
very much in dispute. In the view of some glaciologists, the
ability of ice streams to transport ice rapidly from the
interior to the ocean, on a time-scale of the order of 100
years, indicates an enhanced capability for a drastically
accelerated discharge. A contrary view is that the short
response time of ice streams removes the flux imbalance at
the grounding line so that the purported instability may not
exist.

"Recent observational work does not present a clear
answer either. On the one hand, there is evidence
suggesting unstable behaviour of the WAIS: Ice Stream B
is currently flowing too rapidly for a steady-state; the
current growth of the Crary Ice Rise is affecting the
regional velocity field and perhaps reducing the discharge
of Ice Stream B; and Ice Stream C has stagnated in the last
100-150 years (Retzlaff and Bentley, 1993). Furthermore,
there is geologic evidence that this ice sheet has been
largely or completely absent at some time after its initial
formation (Scherer, 1991; Burckle, 1993), which suggests
transient behaviour in this part of the Ross Ice Shelf
system. On the other hand, there is evidence that does not
support the notion of WAIS instability: the steady flow for
the last 1500 years (except for one pulse a few hundred
years ago) as suggested by flow tracers in the Ross Ice
Shelf; the current growth, rather than collapse, of the
glaciers feeding Pine Island Bay (which lost its ice shelf in
the recent geologic past); and the lack of evidence of
drastic change in the height or flow of the WAIS at Byrd

present time how the uncertainty in the viscosity profile

geological sea level data have been assimilated into, or

models attempt to achieve a consistency between the
geological sea level measurements, the history of

Mantle viscosity is determined from a best fit to the data.

The variability of sea level on interannual to interdecadal
time-scales is a major complication in determining reliable
sea level trends and accelerations (Douglas, 1992). It is
also clear that the global average sea level change is not a
good indicator of local changes at any particular place.

Anthropogenic effects (e.g., extraction of water from
aquifers) can also result in considerable rates of subsidence
(e.g., 10 cm/yr at Bangkok, Thailand). Ground water
extraction has been an important factor in Venice sinking

In large part, these interannual to interdecadal
fluctuations result from the fact that sea level topography,
referenced to the geoid, is closely related to the dynamics
and thermodynamics of the ocean. If the ocean were
homogeneous and at rest, with a uniform atmospheric
pressure field above it and no wind, the sea surface would
correspond to the geoid (i.c., an equipotential of the gravity
field). However, it does not; it differs from the geoid by +
one metre. Ocean and atmosphere are non-homogeneous

Even if land levels were to be measured to good
ptecision, there would still in principle be corresponding
changes in the geoid to take into account. For example,
Wagner and McAdoo (1986) presented maps of secular
trends in geoid heights to be expected from post-glacial
rebound. However, these are approximately an order of
magnitude less than the corresponding changes in vertical
land movements, and in studies of sea level changes over
century time-scales or less, the geoid is considered in most
applications to be time independent. Repeated space
gravity missions, together with long-term laser tracking of
dedicated geodetic satellites, should ideally be mounted to
monitor such changes, while they can continue to be
studied within geodynamic models.

and where the Peltier post-glacial rebound models do not
reproduce relative land-sea movements at all. Most large
river deltas exhibit submergence associated with
sedimentary isostasy which is clearly identified in tide
gauge data. Very local effects, which have no relation to
regional geology, can take place within the harbour of the
tide gauge itself. However, differences between tide gauge

"A good example of alternative methods of monitoring
vertical land movements is provided by the recent
breakthrough in development of absolute gravimeters

the | or 2 microgal level (1 gal = [cm/s”). For instance, a
joint USA-Canada effort to produce the first reliable
gravimetric measurement of glacial rebound shows at
Churchill, Canada, that gravity has been decreasing at 1.6
microgai/yr since 1987. Theoretical models which account
for viscous rebound of crust and mantle beneath Canada
predict a linear relationship between gravity fall and crustal
rise of about 0.15 microgal/mm. These gravity
observations therefore indicate crustal uplift to be 11

the Hudson Bay water level has been falling at an average
rate of 11 mm/yr for the past 50 years.

Studies of the vertical crustal motions on different time-
scales can help elucidate patterns of tectonic deformation
affecting tide gauge data. For example, along convergent
plate boundaries, the uplift recorded by tide gauges or
geodetic levelling measurements generally represent
interseismic deformation that typically spans over 90% of
the earthquake cycle (Bilham, 1991). However, the
deformation during, and also shortly before or after, a
major earthquake may exceed the average interseismic rate
by an order of magnitude. Deformation associated with
major earthquakes may temporarily cause displacements
resulting in sea level changes comparable to the global sea
level change (Bilham and Barrientos, 1991). These recent
rates of crustal motion may differ substantially from
longer-term geological trends derived from raised marine
terraces (see, for example, Kelsey et al., 1994; Mitchell et
al., 1994), Analyses of the changes in uplift rates on
different time-scales may contribute to improved modelling
of the earthquake cycle and extraction of the sea level
signal from the tidal and geodetic data in those regions.

In analysing trends, high-frequency ocean signals,
swells, tides and surges are generally easily removed from
sea level records by filtering techniques, as illustrated,
among others, by Chelton and Enfield (1986) and Sturges
(1987). But the analysis of the low-frequency residuals
remains extremely difficult because these data have red
spectra (the spectral energy keeps rising at low frequency),
and the variability of the lowest frequencies that can
generally be resolved with the longer available sea level
records is of the same amplitude as (or larger than) the
rising sea level signal. It is thus very important to
understand the physical causes of these long-period events
in order to be able to correct the data and improve the
signal-to-noise ratio. Unfortunately, the forcing
mechanisms are not well-known, especially at the decadal
and interdecadal time-scale. The processes involve natural
oscillations of the ocean-atmosphere system, which result
in perturbations of the three dimensional state of the ocean,
in terms of the dynamics and thermodynamics and the
feedback on the state of the atmosphere.

However, sea surface temperature variations, and hence
buoyancy forcing by the atmosphere, are coherent with
changes in the wind (Kushnir, 1994), Thus, thermodynamic
processes also have to be considered in interpreting long-
term sea level variations. Decadal to interdecadal changes in
temperature and salinity of the three-dimensional structure
of the ocean have been widely reported in many places
(Gordon et al., 1992). Taking the North Atlantic as an
example, one can refer to the Great Salinity Anomaly traced
by Dickson ef al. (1988) around the North Atlantic subpolar
gyre from the mid-1960s to the late 1970s, and to the
cooling at intermediate depth in the North Atlantic sub-
polar gyre observed by Lazier and Gershey (1991), Read
and Gould (1992) and Koltermann and Sy (1994), due to
drastic changes in the production rates of Labrador Sea
Water (LSW) and its property characteristics. This
freshening is also present in the 24.5°N sections of
hydrographic data, between 400 and 500 m (Lavin, 1993),
due to some amount of cooler LSW circulating in the sub-
tropical gyre. The complex picture emerging from these
observations is related to the North Atlantic Deep Water
(NADW) production, which propels the global planetary
Thermohaline Conveyor Belt circulation (Broecker et al.,
1985). Changes in the production rate of NADW must
change the northward transport of upper ocean warm water,
and it could lead to an enhancement of sea rise in the mid-
latitudes of the North Atlantic (Mikolajewicz et al., 1990).

temperature, it has an effect on sea level of 3.4 cm in

depth to predict changes in tidal amplitude that might
accompany potential future sea level rise (Rijkswaterstaat,
1986). The effect of changes in depth (a surrogate for sea
level rise) on storm surges can also be investigated. For
example, Flather and Khandker (1993) described how tides
and surges might be modified in the Bay of Bengal if sea
level is modified, assuming that the character of the
prevailing meteorology does not also change. In most
cases, there will be little change in tide and surge (of order
of a few centimetres per metre of sea level rise, unless in
locally resonant situations).

It should include a global sea level monitoring
system based on a network of modern tide gauges.
The Global Sea Level Observing System (GLOSS) of
the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission
(IOC) is a co-ordinated project for the monitoring of
long-term global sea level change and is intended to
serve the various purposes of oceanographic and
climate change research into the next century (IOC,
1990; Woodworth, 1991). GLOSS consists of a
network of approximately 300 tide gauges
worldwide, of which over two-thirds are now
operational. Technical developments in recent years
have seéh many of the traditional float and stilling
well tide gauges replaced by modern systems based
on pneumatic and acoustic principles (Spencer,
1992). Many of these have satellite or telephone data
transmission equipment, enabling real-time data
access and fault checking. Bottom pressure recorders
(Spencer and Vassie, 1985), inverted echo sounders
(Wimbush, 1990) and thermistor chain moorings for
dynamic height (McPhaden, 1993) now provide
quasi-sea level measurements in several areas of the
deep ocean, which will provide information on the
ocean circulation.

example of an area where trends in storm surge activity
have been studied, From analyses of storm surge frequency
around the coast of the UK over the past 70 years, and at
the Hook of Holland (Hoozemans and Wiersma, 1992) and
the German coast over the past few centuries (Rodhe,
1980), there is no evidence of a long-term trend in storm
surge activity, although Rodhe did point to a possible low-
frequency (approximately 80-year) periodicity in flooding.
On the other hand, evidence exists for a trend over the
same period in regional winds and air pressures that would
result in enhanced German Bight mean sea level (and the
surge activity that it reflects) based on gridded Norwegian
meteorological data for the shelf applied to a numerical
model (Tsimplis et al., 1994). Meanwhile, Fiihrbéter and
Toppe (1991) observed tide gauge data in the German
Bight directly and also indicate an increase of storm surge
frequency in the area, at least since 1960 and possibly
before. Local wind data for the Bight itself appear to show
no obvious trend (Hoozemans and Wiersma, 1992) from
1950 to 1980, and in spite of large interdecadal variation,
very little at all over century time-scales (Schmidt, 1991;
Schmidt and von Storch, 1993). Clearly, findings will
depend on the periods analysed and data spans. However,
the difficulty in drawing conclusions relevant to climatic
change studies from this relatively well-instrumented part
of the world cautions against drawing conclusions for areas
with considerably less data.

Measurements are required of the temperature and
salinity fields of the global ocean. Variations in long
distance acoustic pulse travel times can provide for
monitoring of average basin temperatures (Munk,
1989).

For a better understanding of the ocean response to
climate variability and future sea level rise, there is a
need for further developments of coupled
atmosphere, ocean and ice models which explicitly
include sea level predictions. The continued growth
in computer power will strongly support this effort,
as it allows the complexity of the models to increase,
thus improving their performance and realism. The
scientific programmes WOCE and CLIVAR

development of GOOS will provide the necessary

The monitoring system should include near-global
observations of the ocean and ice sheets by means of
satellite altimetry. Radar altimetry has become a
major tool for studying sea level changes over most
of the world ocean. Although a considerable amount
of altimeter data have been acquired previously from,
for example, the USA Navy Geosat satellite and the
European ERS-1 mission, the launch of TOPEX/
POSEIDON in 1992 marked the start of a new era of
precise sea level measurements from space.
TOPEX/POSEIDON is providing sea level data with
a single-point precision of about 5 cm (Fu et al.,
1994), enabling global mean sea level to be measured
every 10 days with a precision of a few mm, Indeed,
results from the first 2 years of the mission suggest
an apparent sea level rise of approximately 3 mm/yr
(Wagner et al., 1994; Nerem, 1995). Given the
number of potential altimeter errors at the millimetre
level, it is premature to attach major significance to
this result, but if measurements of this quality can be
calibrated and maintained throughout a long-term
program of multiple altimeter missions and
integrated with the long-term GLOSS gauges, global
sea level monitoring will be placed on a much firmer
basis (Koblinsky et al, 1992). Meanwhile, ice sheet

An improved geodetic network is required which
enables many of the sea level measurements to be
placed in a stable global co-ordinate system with sub-
centimetric accuracy, and which provides a
decoupling of land and ocean level signals in the tide
gauge records. Remarkable progress has been made in
the past five years toward achieving the required
network, through the development of the International
Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) by the
International Earth Rotation Service (IERS). The
ITRF is based on Very Long Baseline Interferometry
(VLBD), Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) and Global
Positioning System (GPS) observations (Carter et al.,
1989; Bilham, 1991; Ashkenazi et al., 1993; Baker,
1993; Carter, 1994). At many locations measurements
of land movements near to the tide gauge sites by
means of GPS will be supplemented by absolute
gravity recording, with a change of gravity of |
microgal (approximately the current accuracy of the
technique) corresponding to a change of land level of
5S mm (Carter, 1994). VLBI, GPS and SLR enable
precise time-series of polar motion and changes in
rotation rate to be compiled, which may be pertinent
to the problems addressed in this chapter.

better determination of the present ice sheet mass balances

how changes have occurred in the past. The results of such
studies need to be incorporated into improved modelling

There is a need to further quantify the process of
internal accumulation (refreezing of meltwater) for
incorporation into mass balance models. Internal
accumulation (Trabant and Mayo, 1985; Pfeffer er al.,
1991; Reeh, 1991) is pervasive at high latitudes and
at high altitudes, yet is frequently neglected in
glacier-meteorological studies.

Better understanding is required of iceberg calving
flux and its interaction with ice flow dynamics.
Iceberg calving is a major component of the mass
balance of some large glaciers in the Arctic, Alaska,
and at high southern latitudes. However, the iceberg
calving flux, interacts with ice flow dynamics in ways
that are not well understood (Meier, 1994). This
problem needs further investigation and incorporation
into models.

Probably the most critical need is the development of
simple, yet realistic, models which include the
processes linking meteorology to mass balance to
dynamic response, and which include the resulting
feedbacks (Meier, [965). The importance of
incorporating dynamic feedback is obvious when
considering that in the next 50-100 years the estimated
glacier volume change is expected to be a significant
fraction of the total present volume, resulting in a
major change in glacier area, Thus, the contribution of
glaciers to sea level rise will reach a maximum and
then decline despite continuing warming (Kuhn,
1985). The meteoroiogical calculations can be
accomplished by simple hydrometeorological (HM)
models in which accumulation and energy balance are
approximated by functions of seasonal precipitation
and air temperature (e.g., Liestél, 1967; Martin, 1978;
Tangborn, 1980; Reeh, 1991), perhaps parameterized -
for mountain glaciers as functions of altitude (e.g.,
Kuhn, 1981; Oerlemans and Hoogendoorn, 1989;
Laumann and Reeh, 1993), The dynamic processes
can be modelled using conventional glacier flow
models (e.g., Bindschadler, 1982; Stroeven et al.,
1989) or by simpler models that address the response
times (Jéhannesson et al, 1989; Schwitter and
Raymond, 1993).

Model studies need to be extended to ice masses that

Improved modelling of the ice sheets is vitally needed.

directly to sea level rise, changes in the interconnected
grounded ice will affect sea level in ways that cannot be
predicted at the present. Improved understanding will
require combined studies using glaciological,
oceanographic and satellite observations. Because sea ice

"Improvement is also needed in the ice dynamics models.
Short-term, transient behaviour has been observed in major
ice streams. The fact that these changes exist means that
the physics incorporated in contemporary ice sheet models
is not completely realistic. In particular, treatment of basal
sliding and/or deforming basal till, together with the
longitudinal stresses involved, needs to be incorporated.
Another key aspect, currently not well understood and
therefore impossible to model with confidence, is the rate
of iceberg calving. These are the key elements in defining
the interactions between ice sheets, ice streams and ice
shelves. These, together with changes of snow
accumulation, are the most uncertain aspects of predicting
changes in the ice sheets over the next decades to centuries,
and need major improvement.

"The current mass balances of the Antarctic and
Greenland Ice Sheets need to be determined and future
changes monitored. Perhaps the most powerful tool for
doing this in the near future is satellite altimetry. A laser
altimeter is urgently needed on a polar-orbiting satellite,
especially to detect changes in the low-accumulation
regions and critical ice sheet margins where the existing
radar altimetry is not adequate. These measurements
should commence as soon as possible in order to provide a
baseline for detecting greenhouse-induced changes in the
future. The observed seasonal and interannual variations in
surface elevation will provide information on precipitation
variations, which can be used in energy-balance models
and to test atmospheric general circulation model results.
Accurate mapping of surface elevation changes by laser
altimetry will also permit monitoring of ice sheet stability.
Early warning of ice sheet collapse would thus be obtained
before major ice shelf break-up or massive iceberg
discharges were observed. Satellite synthetic-aperture radar
interferometry may allow monitoring of ice stream
velocities and grounding zone locations (Goldstein et al.,
1993; Herzfeld, 1994),

The third area of progress is in the application of pattern-

observed changes in climate to human activities: i.e., to
establish a cause-effect relationship. Most studies that have

used changes in global mean, annually averaged

changes over the past 10-100 years with estimates of
internal or total natural variability noise derived from

observed change in global mean, annually averaged
temperature over the last century is unlikely to be due
entirely to natural fluctuations of the climate system.

"Since the 1990 IPCC Scientific Assessment considerable
progress has been made in attempts to identify an
anthropogenic effect on climate. The first area of
significant advance is that model experiments are now
starting to incorporate the possible climatic effects of
human-induced changes in sulphate aerosols and
stratospheric ozone. The inclusion of these factors has
modified in important ways the picture of how climate
might respond to human influences. Thus, the potential
climate change “signal” due to human activities is now
better defined, although important signal uncertainties still
remain.
"	Text
"Although these global mean results suggest that there is
some anthropogenic component in the observed
temperature record, they cannot be considered as
compelling evidence of a clear cause-and-effect link
between anthropogenic forcing and changes in the Earth’s
surface temperature. It is difficult to achieve attribution of
all or part of a climate change to a specific cause or causes
using global mean changes only. The difficulties arise due
to uncertainties in natural internal variability and in the
histories and magnitudes of natural and human-induced
climate forcings, so that many possible forcing
combinations could yield the same curve of observed
global mean temperature change.
"	Text
" 

To better address the attribution problem, a number of
recent studies have compared observations with the spatial
patterns of temperature-change predicted by models in
response to anthropogenic forcing. The argument
underlying pattern-based approaches is that different
forcing mechanisms have different patterns of response or
characteristic “fingerprints”, particularly if the response is
considered in three or even four dimensions (e.g.,
temperature changes as a function of latitude, longitude,
height and time). Thus, a good match between observed
and modelled multi-dimensional patterns of climate change
increases the likelihood that the “cause” (forcing change)
used in the model experiment is in fact responsible for
producing the observed effect.

The second area of progress is in better defining the
background natural variability of the climate system, a
crucial aspect of the detection problem. “Detection of
change” is the process of demonstrating that an observed
change in climate is highly unusual in a statistical sense.
This requires distinguishing any human effects on climate
from the background “noise” of climate fluctuations that
are entirely natural in origin. Such natural fluctuations can
be either purely internal or externally driven, for example
by changes in solar variability or the volcanic dust loading
of the atmosphere, “Total” natural variability includes both
internal and externally forced components. Estimating
either component of natural climatic noise from observed
data is a difficult problem. Recent multi-century model
experiments that assume no human-induced changes in
anthropogenic forcings have provided important
information about the possible characteristics of the
internal component of total natural variability. However,
large uncertainties still apply to current estimates of the
magnitude and patterns of natural climate variability,
particularly on the decadal- to century-time-scales that are
crucial to the detection problem.

The third area of progress is in the application of pattern-
"	Text
"In addition to these quantitative studies, there are areas of
qualitative agreement between observations and those model
predictions that either include aerosol effects or do not
depend critically on their inclusion. Model and observed
commonalities in which we have most confidence, but
which have not been looked at in detailed detection studies,
include reduction in diurnal temperature range, sea level rise,
high latitude precipitation increases, and water vapour and
evaporation increases over tropical oceans.
"	Text
"Viewed as a whole, these results indicate that the
observed trend in global mean temperature over the past
100 years is unlikely to be entirely natural in origin. More
importantly, there is evidence of an emerging pattern of
climate response to forcings by greenhouse gases and
sulphate aerosols in the observed climate record. This
evidence comes from the geographical, seasonal and
vertical patterns of temperature change. Taken together,
these results point towards a human influence on global
climate. Our ability to quantify the magnitude of this effect
is presently limited by uncertainties in key factors, such as
the magnitude of longer-term natural variability and the
time-evolving patterns of forcing and response to changes
in greenhouse gases, aerosols and other human factors.

"and in vertical sections through the atmosphere. The
results of these studies rest mainly on pattern similarities
at the largest spatial scales, for which model predictions
are most reliable: for example at the scale of temperature
differences between hemispheres, land and ocean, or the
troposphere and stratosphere. While there are concerns
regarding the relatively simple treatment of aerosol effects
in model experiments that attempt to define an
anthropogenic signal, all such pattern comparison studies
show significant correspondences between the
observations and model predictions. The pattern
correspondences increase with time, as one would expect
as an anthropogenic signal increases in strength. Pattern
correspondences using combined CO,+aerosol signals are
generally higher than those obtained if model predictions
are based on changes in CO, alone. Furthermore, the
probability is very low that these correspondences could
occur by chance as a result of natural internal variability.
The vertical patterns of change are also inconsistent with
the response patterns expected for solar and volcanic
forcing. Increasing confidence in the emerging
identification of a human-induced effect on climate comes
primarily from such pattern-based work.

Detection of a significant change is thus by nature a
statistical problem. A standard approach is to try to
disprove the statistical “null” hypothesis that an observed
change in climate can be explained by natural variability. If
the null hypothesis is rejected, we say that we have
detected a climate change at a particular significance level.

In summary, “detection of change” is the process of
demonstrating that an observed change in climate is highly
unusual in a statistical sense, but does not provide a reason
for the change. “Attribution” is the process of establishing
cause and effect, i.e., that changes in anthropogenic
emissions are required in order to explain satisfactorily the
observed change in climate. Unambiguous attribution is
feasible only in the sense of demonstrating that the
observed change is consistent or inconsistent with the
climate responses to a given set of external forcing
mechanisms.

"Statements regarding the detection and attribution of an
anthropogenic effect on climate are inherently probabilistic
in nature. They do not have simple “yes-or-no” answers.
The probability of successful detection of significant
climate change will be given in a range rather than as a
discrete value. The width of this range depends on
uncertainties in model predictions of anthropogenic change
(Section 8.2) and on uncertainties in estimating natural
variability (Section 8.3). A probability range for successful
attribution of the detected changes to human effects will be
more difficult to define.

This does not yet identify the cause of the climate
change, which is the attribution problem. Cause and effect
are generally investigated by carrying out a series of
experiments in which the response of a system to different
causes is studied systematically. Such controlled
experiments cannot be carried out using the real climate
system: we have only one Earth, and only one observed
evolution of the climate system. Furthermore, our
experimentation with the real Earth’s climate is not being
done in any systematic way: we are varying a number of
“causes” simultaneously (e.g., by changing land surface
properties, concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse
gases, and anthropogenic aerosols), rather than changing an
individual cause, observing a climate response, and then
varying the next cause.

Experimentation therefore reqnires the nee af nimerical
"	Text
"The detection problem arises because any climate-
change “signal” due to anthropogenic influences (such as
changes in the emissions of greenhouse gases) is
superimposed on the background “noise” of natural climate
variability, which may partly or wholly mask the signal.
Natural climate variability has both internal and external
components. The internal component is due solely to
interactions within the coupled atmosphere-ocean-ice-land-
biosphere system. The external component is primarily
caused by natural changes in the Sun’s output or in the
volcanic aerosol loading of the atmosphere. Because of
these natural internal and external processes, climate is
always changing for reasons that are unrelated to human
activities. A change in climate is judged to be “significant”
if it is unusual relative to the changes expected to result
from natural variability.

 
"	Text
"This is clearly a very difficult task, since there are large
uncertainties in defining all possible “natural” climate-
change signals. Attribution, therefore, can never be
“certain” in a purely statistical sense: we can state only that
the available observations are consistent or inconsistent
with a postulated hypothesis at a given confidence level.
The claimed statistical detection of an anthropogenic signal
in the observations must always be accompanied by the
caveat that other explanations for the detected climate-
change signal cannot be ruled out completely. There is,
however, an important distinction between achieving
“practically meaningful” and “statistically unambiguous”
attribution. This distinction rests on the fact that scientists
and policymakers have different perceptions of risk. While
a scientist might require decades in order to reduce the risk
of making an erroneous decision on climate change
attribution to an acceptably low level (say 1-5%), a
policymaker must often make decisions without the benefit
of waiting decades for near-statistical certainty.

At the base of the hierarchy are studies that deal with the

However, none of these studies has convincingly
demonstrated that this change can be uniquely attributed to
anthropogenic influences (see Section 8.4.1).

Detection of a significant observed change in a Stage 2
study generally implies that even hemispheric- or sub-
continental-scale features of observed and model-predicted
patterns of change show a level of time-increasing
agreement well beyond that expected due to natural
variability alone!. If such a pattern correspondence were
observed for a particular hypothesised set of causal factors,
then (because this requires simultaneous agreement in a
number of spatially separated regions) it is less likely that
similar agreement could be obtained for a different set of
causal factors. Nevertheless, to claim attribution
convincingly still requires that alternative non-
anthropogenic explanations for the observed changes be
tested in a rigorous way, as described in Section 8.1.1.

"Stage 1 studies consider whether the observed change in
global mean temperature over some period of time
(generally the last century or so) is unusual in a statistical
sense. To define “unusual” requires some “baseline” or
“yardstick” of usual behaviour. It is difficult to make direct
use of the recent observed data themselves, since signal and
noise are intertwined in a complex way. The yardstick most
frequently applied is internally generated natural variability,
either as simulated by some physically based model (e.g.,
Wigley et al., 1989; Wigley and Raper, 1990, 1991a,b;
Stouffer et al., 1994), or as derived from a statistical model
fitted to observations (e.g., Karl et al., 1991a; Bloomfield
and Nychka, 1992; Woodward and Gray, 1993, 1995). The
observed global mean change is deemed to be significant

"In a purely subjective sense, however, a scientist would
probably feel more confidence in the attribution of
observed changes to a specific cause or causes after
“successful detection” in a Stage 2 study than in a Stage |
study. The justification for this line of thinking is the
implicit assumption that different “causes” have different
climate response patterns. This need not be the case,
however. For example, some evidence suggests that the
patterns ‘of surface temperature change due to solar forcing
and CO, doubling may be similar, since both climate
forcings operate via similar feedback mechanisms, and
these feedbacks dictate the spatial character of the response
(Wigley and Jones, 1981; Hansen et al., 1984). Yet the
detailed three-dimensional structure of the thermal
response to these two different forcings may well be
different (e.g., Wetherald and Manabe, 1975). In the case
of combined forcing by CO, and anthropogenic sulphate
aerosols, it is unlikely that the spatially distinctive surface
temperature response could be produced by other causes.

atmospheric CO, levels were instantaneously doubled. In

"8.1.2.4 Stage 4 studies

Stage 4 studies differ from the earlier categories in their
use of a number of climate variables simultaneously. Thus
the searched-for anthropogenic signal in a Stage 4
investigation might consist of patterns of change in surface
air temperature, precipitable water, diurnal temperature
range, etc. Each variable would be defined in at least two
(and possibly three or four) dimensions. The individual
components of this multi-variable “fingerprint” might be
decided upon by preliminary analysis of the signal-to-noise
properties of a wide range of climate variables in model
data (see Section 8.4.3). At Stage 4, “successful detection”
would mean that the multi-variate, space-time varying
climate-change signal from a model experiment forced
with transient increases in anthropogenic emissions was in
good accord with available observations. To date, only one
attempt has been made to use a full multi-dimensional and
multi-variable description of signal and noise in a climate-
change detection study (Barnett and Schlesinger, 1987).

Before IPCC (1990), only a few experiments with time-
varying CO, had been performed with fully coupled
atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs)
(Stouffer et al., 1989; Washington and Meehl, 1989). Since
1990, at least four modelling groups have published results
from such integrations (e.g., Manabe et al., 1991; Cubasch
et al., 1992; Meehl er al., 1993; Murphy and Mitchell,
1995; see Chapter 6 for further references). The climate-
change signal from these experiments now has both space
and time dimensions. The inclusion of full ocean dynamics
has modified the climate-change projections of earlier
experiments which had simpler representations of the
ocean. Furthermore, at least three modelling groups have
now performed both equilibrium and transient response
experiments with an AOGCM (Cubasch et al., 1992;
Manabe and Stouffer, 1993; Murphy and Mitchell, 1995).
This addresses the question of whether very different
forcing histories yield fundamentally different signal
patterns, and hence provides insights into the relevance of
using results from equilibrium experiments in detection
studies. There has also been widespread recognition of the
need for ensemble experiments to obtain more reliable
estimates of an anthropogenic signal (Cubasch et al., 1994),

Statistical methods are the third main area in which
advances have been made since IPCC (1990). The last five
years have seen an increase in the number and
sophistication of statistical techniques that have been
applied to the problem of identifying anthropogenic
change. Two important examples are the application of
Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) to partition signal and
noise in global mean temperature data (e.g., Ghil and
Vautard, 1991; Schlesinger and Ramankutty, 1994) and the
definition and application of “optimal detection”

Recent model simulations have also provided initial
information about the background natural internal
variability against which an anthropogenic signal must be
detected. This is the second major area of progress since
IPCC (1990). Two modelling groups have recently
completed long (21000 years) control runs, which contain
a wealth of information on the magnitude, patterns and
time-scales of internal climate variability generated by
AOGCMs (Delworth et al., 1993; Stouffer et al., 1994;
Hasselmann et al., 1995). These model-generated noise
estimates are now being used as the “yardsticks” for
judging significance in climate-change detection studies
(see Section 8.4), and first attempts are underway to check
the consistency of decadal to century time-scale natural
variability noise estimates derived from models and
palaeodata (Barnett er al., 1996). Additionally, information
from palaeoclimatic proxy records is now being used to
estimate the natural variability of surface temperature on

is then run for some “adaptation” period prior to initiating a
control or perturbation experiment. The interactive
coupling of AOGCMs generally leads to a phenomenon
known as climate drift — the tendency of the model’s

forced with identical increases-in greenhouse gases, with
each experiment starting from different “snapshots” of the
climate state (taken at 30-year intervals from a long control

natural internal variability alone (see Chapter 6).

For pattern-based detection studies, reliable definition of
an anthropogenic signal requires, at the very least, a
reliable estimate of present-day SO, emissions and their
spatial distribution, and an accurate interpretation of these
in terms of a forcing pattern (Schneider, 1994). Studies that
involve a time-evolving signal additionally require
information on the historical evolution of emissions and

Surface air temperature is undoubtedly the best-observed
climate variable in terms of length of the instrumental

Even in this case, however, the length of record (ca. 130-
150 years) is barely adequate to obtain a reliable estimate
of the multi-decadal portion of the spectrum, and is
inadequate to estimate longer time-scale variability.
Furthermore, the instrumental record covers a period when

Nevertheless, several attempts have been made to
estimate the background natural variability by subtracting a
model-estimated anthropogenic signal from the observed
data (Schlesinger and Ramankutty, 1994; Hegerl ez al.,
1996). The latter investigation used an AOGCM to define a
single pattern of temperature. change in response to
greenhouse gas forcing, and then employed a simple model
to estimate the time evolution of this signal pattern. This
estimate of the space-time evolving greenhouse signal was
then subtracted from the observed data, and the residuals
were used to estimate natural variability. The reliability of
such variability estimates depends critically on the
accuracy of the AOGCM’s climate sensitivity, on the
correctness of any assumed lag between radiative forcing
and temperature response in the simple model, on the
reliability of the signal pattern, and on the correctness of
the assumed radiative forcing history. Estimating multi-

statistical atmospheres. Virtually all such simulations show
interdecadal to centennial time-scale variations no matter
what the form of the ocean GCM or the character of the

be the fresh water flux between the atmosphere and the

range from 10-350 years or longer. The more realistic of
these simulations show a rich set of oscillatory modes

Unfortunately, unravelling the history of climatic
variability contained in such records is not a simple task, as
is discussed in Chapter 3. Few proxy records are capable of
providing well-dated millennia-long reconstructions with at
least decadal time-scale resolution. In addition, a number
of general problems are common to all proxy records. Most
temperature reconstructions, for example, are seasonally
specific, rather than providing some integrated response to
annual-mean conditions. In order to produce a
reconstruction, the raw data are generally subjected to
some form of statistical manipulation, through which only
part of the original climate information can be retrieved
(typically less than 50%). Such manipulations can also
affect the frequency characteristics of the reconstruction
(Briffa et al., 1996). More importantly, spatial coverage is
poor for high temporal resolution palaeoclimate data, and it
is often difficult to compare the climate information
extracted from different locations (e.g., land and ocean) or
from different proxy sources.

Claims of non-significance of the global warming trend
have also been made by Ghil and Vautard (1991) using
Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA). The basic argument is
that the data show a low-frequency cyclic component that
is in phase with and explains most of the observed trend.
While the cyclic component is a characteristic of the data,
whether or not it is a valid alternative explanation of the
trend depends on whether it is a basic, long-lasting,
deterministic property of the climate system. It is
impossible to determine whether this is correct given the
shortness of the available data (see, e.g., Allen er al., 1992;
Cook et al., 1996). Furthermore, Schlesinger and
Ramankutty (1994) have shown that a better explanation of
the cyclic component identified by Ghil and Vautard is to
assume that it is superimposed on an anthropogenic trend.

model (i.e., assuming, unrealistically, that solar forcing and
temperature response are proportional and in phase — as in
the work of Friis-Christensen and Lassen, 1991), through
simple regression models (as in the work of Schénwiese et
al., 1994, and earlier papers cited therein) that are
unrealistically constrained to have a constant lag between
forcing and response, to using an upwelling diffusion-
energy balance model (UD/EBM), as in IPCC (1990)
(Wigley and Barnett, 1990). In terms of imposed forcing,
some studies have considered only a single forcing factor,
such as solar variability alone in the work of Friis-
Christensen and Lassen, while others have considered
multiple forcing factors, both natural and anthropogenic.
Since the primary area of uncertainty is in the response to
anthropogenic forcing, global mean studies using only a
single “natural” forcing factor and ignoring any
anthropogenic component are inadequate, as pointed out by
Schlesinger and Ramankutty (1992) and Kelly and Wigley
(1992).

trend pattern spans the period 1860 to 1879, the second the period
1861 to 1880, etc. The detection variable was calculated by
projecting the observed trend patterns onto a “fingerprint”, here
defined as the long-term pattern of temperature change (from
roughly 1990 to 2080) in an “Early Industrialisation” experiment

internal variability. The detection variable was also computed using
the optimised fingerprint and patterns of overlapping 20-year trends

reflecting the increase in global mean temperature. The behaviour

"6.4.2.2 Anthropogenic sulphate aerosol signals

Until recently, investigations of the possible impact of
anthropogenic sulphate aerosols on observed surface air
temperature were restricted to analyses of observed
changes in areas where SO, emissions and/or forcing are
likely to have been large (Wigley et al., 1992; Hunter et
al., 1993), or to a visual comparison of observed
temperature change patterns and patterns of vertically
integrated aerosol concentration predicted by a chemical-
transport model (Engardt and Rodhe, 1993), These studies
have shown qualitatively that some features of the recent
instrumental surface temperature record are consistent with
a sulphate aerosol effect on climate.

change over the last 20 to 50 years, in accord with Stage 1
detection studies (see Section 8.4.1). Implicit in these
global mean results is a weak attribution statement — if the
observed global mean changes over the last 20 to 50 years
cannot be fully explained by natural climate variability,
some (unknown) fraction of the changes must be due to
human influences. Significant results have not been
obtained for the sub-global-scale pattern component of a
greenhouse warming signal, thus precluding more
confident statements regarding attribution of observed
changes to the specific cause of increases in greenhouse
gas concentrations. The validity of conclusions on the
significance of both the global mean and pattern
components of a greenhouse gas signal depends on whether
the estimates of natural variability noise used in these
studies are realistic.

Four separate multi-variate detection studies have searched

Three of these have dealt with changes in near-surface
temperature (Hasselmann et al., 1995; Mitchell et al.,

The climate-change signal in the near-surface
temperature study by Santer e¢ al. (1995a) was derived
from equilibrium response experiments by Taylor and
Penner (1994), in which an AGCM coupled to a mixed-
layer ocean and a model of tropospheric sulphate chemistry
was forced by present-day levels of atmospheric CO, and
anthropogenic sulphur emissions. The temperature
response to the combined forcing in the Taylor and Penner
experiment is very different from the response to forcing
by CO, alone (see Figure 8.9), showing both spatially
coherent cooling and warming regions ~ a characteristic of
the way surface temperature in the real world has actually
changed (see Chapter 3). This response pattern has large
uncertainties. Perhaps the most important of these is that
the pattern is clearly a function of the relative magnitudes
of the positive forcing by CO, and the negative forcing by
the direct effect of anthropogenic sulphate aerosols, with
the latter only poorly known (see Chapter 2 and Section
8.2.5). Further signal uncertainties include those arising
from the lack of a dynamic ocean, the neglect of the
indirect effects of sulphate aerosols, possible model-
dependence of the results, and signal estimation problems
(see Section 8.2.4 and 8.2.5).

This is encouraging in terms of attribution, since the
similarity between emissions changes and temperature
changes is not simply at a global mean level, and since
seasonal variations in the obtained significance levels are
in agreement with our physical understanding of the
seasonality in forcing due to direct aerosol effects, There is
some scope for improving these results by using a pattern
of temperature response rather than a pattern of change in
emissions or forcing. Detection studies that employ some
“proxy” for the temperature response, such as the pattern of
observed changes in sulphur emissions used by Karl e¢ al.
or the pattern of sulphate aerosol distribution or aerosol
forcing predicted by a sulphur chemistry model (Wigley e¢
al., 1992; Engardt and Rodhe, 1993), do not account for
any modulation of the regional aerosol forcing by the
general circulation of the atmosphere, and could be
searching for sub-optimal signals. This may be of lesser
consequence in the latitude bands (50°N-55°N) where Karl
et al. find the strongest relationships between SO,
emissions and temperature changes, since this is likely to
be a region where there is a stronger correspondence
between emissions, forcing and response.

by present-day atmospheric concentrations of CO, (a), and by the
combined effects of present-day CO, levels and sulphur emissions
(b) (see Figure 8.7 for details). For each experiment, a single
pattern characterises the temperature-change signal. This signal is
then searched for in observed time-varying records of near-surface
temperature change. The figure shows results for the autumn season
(SON). In the case of combined CO, + sulphate aerosol forcing,
there is a positive linear trend in the R(t) time-series over the last 50
years (1944 to 1993), indicating that sub-global-scale features of the
observed temperature-change patterns are becoming increasingly
similar to the predicted signal pattern. No such increasing similarity
is found for the CO,-only signal. The 50-year trend in R(t) in the
experiment with combined forcing was highly significant relative
to estimates of internally generated natural variability from two
extended AOGCM control runs (Santer et a/., 1995a). The initial
decrease in R(t) from roughly 1910 to 1945 (b) has not been fully
explained, but is likely due to the fact that the observed warming in
the 1930s and 1940s had some similarity to a CO,-only signal, and
was different in character from more recent changes.

point out that there is a fundamental difficulty in assessing
“qualitative consistency”. Our ideas about an expected
signal in response to anthropogenic activities have changed
with time, and are likely to change in the future. In the
1980s, expectations of the climate response to
anthropogenic factors were largely dictated by CO,-only

This agreement does not, however, constitute
identification of an anthropogenic effect on climate and
may be serendipitous. The degree of consistency between
modelJed and observed global mean, annually averaged
temperature changes depends on a variety of factors. These
include the model’s climate sensitivity, the magnitude and
sign of simulated multi-decadal variability (and or climate
drift), oceanic thermal inertia, and the relative strength of
the positive forcing due to greenhouse gases and the
negative forcing due to aerosols. It is certainly feasible that
qualitative agreement could be due to compensating errors,
such as a climate sensitivity that is too high being partially
offset by cooling due to a residual drift, or by an
overestimated aerosol effect. Nevertheless, the recent
modelling work does show that it is possible to explain past
changes in a global-scale property of the climate system in
a plausible way.

Early attempts to explain these changes were
unsuccessful. Model simulations with increases in
greenhouse gases alone or in combination with the direct
effects of sulphate aerosols could not capture the amplitude
and pattern of the observed changes. New modelling and
observational studies (Hansen ef al., 1995b; Stenchikov
and Robock, 1995) have provided insight into this apparent
inconsistency between model projections and the observed
decrease of DTR by noting the importance of cloud effects.
Thus, Hansen et al. (1995b) found that no plausible
combination of forcings other than CO,, sulphate aerosols
and increases in cloud cover could explain the observed
reduction in DTR and the increase in mean temperature in
their model. Whether the required cloud changes, which
are in accord with available observations, are also
primarily an anthropogenic effect (i.e., due to the indirect
effects of sulphate aerosols; see Chapter 2) or are due to
natural climate variability is currently unknown.

and other time-series by Emslie and Christy (1996) and
Karl et al. (1996b) have failed to confirm the existence of a
significant post-1940 phase shift in the annual cycle (see
Chapter 3). It remains to be determined whether such phase
shifts are robust features of the data and are consistent with
the predictions of AOGCMs in experiments with time-
dependent forcing by CO, and aerosols.

Mitchell, pers. comm.). This would translate to a tropospheric
trend of about 0.08—0.30°C/decade given the observed
magnitude of surface versus tropospheric variability. These
latter linear trend estimates are in much closer agreement
with the adjusted MSU data, i.e., there is no serious
inconsistency between the most recent model predictions and
MSU-based trend estimates (Hansen et al., 1995a).

As discussed i in n Chapter 3 and by Hansen « et al. (1995a),
there has been considerable confusion in the scientific
literature regarding the question of whether instrumental-
and model-based estimates of global temperature trends
over the period 1979 to 1993 are in conflict with satellite-
based observations. Here, we consider only whether model-
predicted near-surface temperature trends are inconsistent
with estimates of low to mid-tropospheric temperature
trends derived from the satellite-based Microwave
Sounding Unit (MSU).

"The key point to note here is that the MSU record is
short (>20 years) for the purposes of detecting a slowly
evolving anthropogenic signal. This short record limits
comparisons of satellite-based and model-predicted data to
decadal time-scale temperature trends. These trends are
strongly affected by the background noise of interannual to
decadal time-scale natural variability (see, for example, the
lack of significance for the most recent 10-year trends in
near-surface temperature in Figure 8.3). It is therefore
difficult to make a meaningful interpretation of any
differences in trends on these short time-scales.

"They concluded that these values were roughly four
times larger than the MSU-based trend of roughly
0.09°C/decade, which was obtained after adjusting the
MSU data for the effects of El Nifio and volcanic aerosols.
However, as noted by Hansen er al. (1995b), the model
predictions on which this comparison is based were taken
either from equilibrium CO, doubling experiments that
were not relevant to the problem of predicting time-
dependent change, or from time-dependent “CO,-only”
simulations with rates of change of radiative forcing that
were larger than observed.

"The gradual emergence of an anthropogenic climate
change signal from the background noise of natural
variability guarantees that any initial pronouncement that a
change in the climate has been detected and attributed to a
specific cause will be questioned by some scientists.
Nevertheless, if the current rate of increase of
anthropogenic emissions is maintained and if the
sensitivity of the climate system to anthropogenic
perturbations is within the range predicted by current
climate theory, it should become increasingly easy to
eliminate natural variability and other natural external
forcings as causes for most of the observed changes.
"	Text
"Detection of a human-induced change in the Earth’s
climate will be an evolutionary and not a revolutionary
process. It is the gradual accumulation of evidence that will
implicate anthropogenic emissions as the cause of some
part of observed climate change, not the results from a
single study. While there is already initial evidence for the
existence of an anthropogenic climate signal, it is likely (if
model predictions are correct) that this signal will emerge
more and more convincingly with time. It is probable that
it will be discernible at the global scale first and only later
at regional scales (Briffa et al., 1990; Karl et al., 199 1a),
and that it will be clearer in some variables than in others.
Convincing attribution, however, is likely to come from the
analysis of full spatial patterns of change: again, as an
evolutionary process,

"Finally, we come to the difficult question of when the
detection and attribution of human-induced climate change
is likely to occur. The answer to this question must be
subjective, particularly in the light of the large signal and
noise uncertainties discussed in this chapter. Some
scientists maintain that these uncertainties currently
preclude any answer to the question posed above. Other
scientists would and have claimed, on the basis of the
statistical results presented in Section 8.4, that confident
detection of a significant anthropogenic climate change has
already occurred.

"As noted in Section 8.1, attribution involves statistical
testing of alternative explanations for a detected observed
change, and few would be willing to argue that completely
unambiguous attribution of (all or part of) this change has
already occurred, or was likely to happen in the next few
years. However, evidence from the pattern-based studies
reported on here suggests that an initial step has now been
taken in the direction of attribution, since correspondences
between observations and model predictions in response to
combined changes in greenhouse gases and anthropogenic
sulphate aerosols:

Analyses based on atmospheric CO, and CO,
measurements suggest that the terrestrial biosphere is
currently a net carbon sink, Such analyses quantify the
strength of this sink as 0.5-1.9 GtC/yr during the 1980s,
and as high as 2.6 GtC/yr during 1992-3; they also suggest
that the tropics have been a net carbon source, implying
even greater rates of carbon storage in mid- to high
latitudes. Direct observations to establish the processes
responsible for this carbon storage are, however, lacking.
Possiblities include post-harvest regrowth of mid- and high
latitude forests (0.5-0,9 GtC/yr according to IPCC WGII
(1995), Chapter 24), enhanced vegetation growth due to
physiological effects of increasing CO, (0.5-2.0 GtC/yr)
and nitrogen deposition (0.5-1.0 GtC/yr) (figures from
model calculations), and, probably, a substantial range
(0-2.0 GtC/yr) of interannual variation due to climatic
anomalies. These processes are not additive: for example,
the rate of carbon sequestration in mid-latitude forests may
include effects of all of the other processes.

"Further uncertainties arise because changes in climate

in the local abundance of species and genetic sub-groups

With slow change, shifts in competitive balance among
species might occur subtly with minor effects on terrestrial
carbon storage. With rapid change, direct impacts on the
growth and survival of particular types of plants could
cause die back and carbon loss before better adapted types

carbon loss and accumulation under rapid climate change

Methane is produced in flooded organic soils as a result of
the metabolic activities of micro-organisms in the absence
of oxygen. Methane emissions from natural wetlands
contribute about 20% to the global emissions of this gas to
the atmosphere. Methane flux from wetlands could either
increase due to rising temperatures and CO,, or decrease
due to drying of the soils. If high latitude wetlands dry out,
however, there will be a release of stored carbon as CO,.
The rate of CO, release with drying is uncertain, but
potentially large since as much as 450 GtC may be stored
in high latitude wetlands.

Young and middle-aged forests accumulate carbon, while
old-growth forests accumulate little if any carbon, Forests
of the Northern Hemisphere’s mid-latitudes that were
harvested in the early and middle parts of the 20th century
are still regrowing and accumulating carbon (e.g., Kauppi et
al., 1992; Wofsy ef al., 1993). Estimates of rates of carbon
accumulation related to forest regrowth in these regions
range between 0.7 and 0.8 GtC/yr for the 1980s (Melillo et
al., 1988; Sedjo, 1992; Dixon et al., 1994). Melillo eg al.
(1988) have argued that the fate of the cut wood must also
be taken into account when evaluating the net effect of
forest harvest and regrowth in the global carbon budget; that
is, the rate at which the carbon in the cut wood is returned
to the atmosphere as a result of burning and decay must be
considered. When Melillo e¢ al. did this, they concluded
that the net effect of forest harvest and regrowth for the
middle and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere on
terrestrial net carbon storage was approximately zero in the
1980s. It must be recognised that there are considerable
uncertainties associated with estimating the fate of cut
wood, including wood left at the harvest sites, fire wood,
and wood products such as paper and lumber (Melillo et al.,
1988; Harmon et al., 1990). Because of these uncertainties,

In addition to the possibility of simultaneous feedbacks
of opposite sign, there are other aspects of global change
that may affect terrestrial ecosystem metabolism and carbon
storage. Some of the major effects are associated with the
burning of fossil fuels, which causes changes in the
chemistry of the atmosphere and precipitation. Fossil fuel
burning can lead to the production of air pollutants such as
sulphur dioxide and ozone that are toxic to plants. These air
pollutants can decrease NPP and carbon storage (Allen and
Amthor, 1995). The burning of fossil fuels can also lead to
increases in nitrogen in precipitation. Up to some
cumulative level, increased nitrogen inputs to nitrogen-
limited ecosystems, such as many temperate and boreal
forests of the northern hemisphere, can cause increases in
NPP and carbon storage. Nitrogen inputs beyond the
threshold level can lead to decreases in NPP and carbon
storage (Aber et al., 1989; Schulze et al., 1989).

Climate affects carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems
because temperature, moisture, and radiation influence
both carbon gain through photosynthesis and carbon loss
through respiration. Soil respiration is generally
accelerated by higher temperatures, producing an increase
in the release of CO, from terrestrial ecosystems
(Houghton and Woodwell, 1989; Melillo et al., 1990;
Shaver et al., 1992; Townsend et al., 1992; Oechel er al.,
1993; Peterjohn ef al., 1993, 1994; Lloyd and Taylor,
1994; Schimel et al., 1994; Kirschbaum, 1995). It is
thought that in many ecosystems the increase of soil
respiration with temperature is steeper than any increase of
NPP with temperature, so that the net effect of warming is
to reduce carbon storage. Lloyd and Taylor (1994),
however, caution that valid conclusions regarding the
effects of possible changes in temperatures on soil carbon
pools cannot yet be made because we lack a detailed
knowledge of the temperature sensitivity of carbon input
into the soil via NPP.

The first model-based analyses of the current effects of
CO, increase on terrestrial carbon storage were performed
with simple models in which the terrestrial biosphere was
represented by one or a few boxes. In one such analysis,
Gifford (1993) worked within a plausible range of values
(10, 25 and 40%) for the increase in NPP at doubled CO,.
Assuming that the terrestrial biosphere was in equilibrium
in pre-industrial times, he forced his model with the
historical record to give an idea of the extent to which the
CO, increase would produce an imbalance of carbon
uptake and release. The resulting terrestrial carbon storage
rates due to this mechanism were 0.5, 2.0 and 4.0 GtC/yr

in an analogous model experiment, that CO, fertilisation

"sequestration at the ecosystem level depends not only on
plant photosynthesis, respiration and growth, but also on
the fluxes of carbon out of litter and soil carbon pools. At
equilibrium, plant NPP would be balanced by these
microbially mediated soil fluxes (R,,). However, if there is
a progressive change in NPP such as a progressive increase
in NPP due to the effect of rising CO,, the system will not
be in equilibrium. In general the soil CO, flux (R,,) is
proportional to the size of the decomposing carbon pools,
whereas NPP is determined by the activity of the leaves. If
CO, increases, NPP may therefore increase immediately
while the size of the decomposing pools takes time to build
up. If NPP were to stop increasing (e.g., due to CO,
stabilisation), the sink would weaken, with a decay time
determined by the residence times of the pools to which
carbon has been added. This is the theoretical explanation
for why rising CO, is thought to be producing a carbon
sink, and why the sink may be a transient one (Taylor and

Studies of both crop and non-crop plants grown in
doubled CO, have shown increased growth responses often
in the range of 15 to 71%. The total range is from a
negative response of 43% to a positive response of up to
375% (Kimball, 1975; Kimball and Idso, 1983; Eamus and

1994, Idso and Idso, 1994; McGuire et al., 1995a;
Wullschleger et al., 1995). Across the tissue, plant and .
ecosystem levels the experimental evidence shows that the
proportional response of NPP to elevated CO, is greater
when soil moisture is depleted. Elevated CO, generally
decreases stomatal conductance and hence transpiration,
enhancing NPP by promoting ‘greater water use efficiency
(Gifford, 1979; Wong, 1979; Morrison and Gifford, 1984;
Polley et al., 1993). There is some evidence that nitrogen-
limited plants are less responsive to increases in CO, level
(McGuire et al., 1995a), but a recent review suggests that
this is not always true (Lloyd and Farquhar, 1995).

A short-term increase in CO, concentration causes an
increase in photosynthesis at the level of individual leaves
(e.g., Idso and Kimball, 1993). Leaves may acclimate to
increased CO, such that long-term increases in CO, result
in smaller increases in leaf-level photosynthesis (Wong,
1979; Tissue and Oechel, 1987; Fetcher et al., 1988; Sage
et al., 1989); but this does not always occur (e.g., Masle et
al., 1993; Gunderson and Wullschleger, 1994; Luo et al.,
1994; Sage, 1994). At the level of the whole plant,
feedbacks from non-leaf organs can influence leaf
photosynthetic responses to CO). If photosynthesis
increases to a greater extent than the rate at which carbon
assimilated during photosynthesis can be used in additional
growth, photosynthesis can be slowed by negative
metabolic feedbacks in plants (Arp, 1991; Bowes, 1991;
Luo ef al., 1994; Sage, 1994). On the other hand, an
increased carbohydrate supply which is allocated below
ground may help to alleviate nutrient limitations on
photosynthesis by enhancing biological nitrogen fixation
and/or increasing mychorrizal activity leading to greater
uptake of phosphorus (Norby, 1987; O’Neill et al., 1987;

- Experimental evidence supports the nitrogen-stimulation
mechanism for increasing carbon storage in mid-latitude
forests. In a field study in which 50 kg N/ha/yr has been
added to large plots of healthy evergreen and deciduous
forests for several years, carbon storage in aboveground
woody tissue has increased by 10—20%/yr (Aber et al.,
1993). However, this increase in carbon storage is expected
to reach a threshold level beyond which further additions
of nitrogen are likely to result in NPP reduction, tree death,
and carbon loss (Aber et al., 1989; Schulze et al., 1989).

Those mid-latitude ecosystems of the Northern Hemisphere
that are near or downwind of industrial and agricultural
areas are receiving large inputs of nitrogen, mostly from
fossil fuel burning. Forests in western and central Europe
and eastern North America receive up to 50 kg N/ha/yr
(Melillo et al., 1989; Schulze et al., 1989) or more. These
nitrogen inputs may be enhancing NPP and terrestrial
carbon storage. For example, Kauppi et al, (1992)
suggested that increases in the growth rates of European
forests observed between 1950 and 1980 were due to
nitrogen fertilisation, although other mechanisms such as
CO, fertilisation, climate variability and management

evidence that the growth of urban and industrialised areas
and intensive agriculture, through their production of
tropospheric ozone, are reducing agricultural yields and,
presumably, plant growth in adjacent non-agricultural
ecosystems. Sulphur dioxide’s main effect appears to be to
reduce photosynthesis, which leads to reduced plant growth
(Allen and Amthor, 1995). In combination, ozone and
sulphur dioxide can interact to magnify the negative effects
of either pollutant alone on plant growth (Ormrod, 1982).
While it is not disputed that ozone and sulphur dioxide
pollution have the potential to reduce both NPP and carbon
storage in terrestrial ecosystems, there is little basis for
making global estimates of these effects (Chameides et al.,

of the fate of nitrogen added to forest ecosystems suggests
that between 70 and 90% ends up in the soil, which has a

reality deposited on grasslands and agricultural lands where

only a few weeks without rain unless they have access to
deep water, to succulents that store water, and other hot

evergreen trees survive drought by reducing transpiration
to near zero, while drought deciduous trees lose their
leaves. As water availability declines further, trees give

Cold tolerance in woody plants ranges from tropical
trees, some damaged by temperatures of less than 10°C, to
boreal deciduous trees which in their leafless, cold-
hardened state have apparently unlimited tolerance (Sakai

Warmer winters would cause an expansion of more diverse
woody plant types towards the poles and continental
interiors. Warmer summers, and/or longer growing
seasons, would also allow some cold-adapted trees to
spread poleward (Emanuel et al., 1985; Pastor and Post,

season warmth is limiting. Cold-tolerant woody plants
have, however, evolved mechanisms to delay spring
budburst until day length is adequate, and/or a long enough
chilling period has occurred: These mechanisms insure
against the possibility of premature budburst in a mild

Vegetation structure is determined not only by the types of
plants present but also by the height and foliage cover they
attain, Foliage cover, often expressed as leaf area index
(LAI), is constrained by resource availability (water,
carbon, nitrogen). LAI decreases as water availability
declines. Along moisture gradients, vegetation composition
and structure change due partly to replacement of drought-
sensitive by drought-tolerant (or more deep-rooted) plant
types, and partly to reductions in the LAI of each type
(Walter, 1979). Values for LAI are typically low enough to
prevent drought damage in most years (Specht, 1972;
Woodward, 1987; Neilson, 1995), so maintaining annual
NPP near maximal for the environment (Eagleson, 1978;
Haxeltine et al., 1996). Changes in water availability will
therefore affect LAI (Smith et al., 1993), but the response
may be modified by changes in CO,. In particular,
increasing CO, (by reducing transpiration) would be
expected to compensate for the effect of reduced water
availability on LAI (Jarvis, 1989; Woodward, 1992;
VEMAP Members, 1995).

9.3.4 Global Biome Model Projections
Global models for ecosystem dynamics, that can simulate
the transient response of vegetation structure to changes in
climate and atmospheric CO,, are being developed by
several groups but none has yet been published. Simple
biome models project equilibrium distributions of broad
vegetation types (“potential natural vegetation”) from
ecophysiological constraints, but without consideration of
CO, effects on plant physiology. The BIOME model
(Prentice et al., 1992) reproduces well the present
vegetation as mapped by Olson et al. (1983), except where
intensive agriculture predominates. BIOME has been
applied to various 2 * CO, equilibrium climate scenarios
developed using outputs from atmospheric general
circulation models (GCMs) (Solomon et al., 1993;
Claussen, 1994; Claussen and Esch, 1994; Prentice and
Sykes, 1995). Consistent results include poleward shifts of
the northern-hemisphere taiga, temperate deciduous, and
warm-temperate evergreen/warm mixed forest belts, a
northward shift of the Eurasian taiga, and a slight
expansion of tropical seasonal and rain forests into areas of
warm-temperate evergreen forests (IPCC WG II, 1995).
Differences among GCM scenarios in the extent of these
changes are consistent with the GCMs’ different climate
sensitivities. Some scenarios (not all) show reductions of
temperate forests in the continental interiors.

(1) Wet tropical climates support evergreen rain forest;
longer dry seasons favour drought-deciduous trees in
seasonal and dry forests (Chabot and Hicks, 1982;
Haxeltine et al., 1996). Any change in monsoon
duration would shift the natural boundaries among
these forest types.

(2) Savannahs represent an equilibrium of trees and
grasses. In seasonal tropical climates, grasslands are
favoured by summer rainfall and slow-percolating
clay soils, woodlands by winter rainfall and sandy
soils (Walter, 1979; Walker and Noy-Meir, 1982;
Lauenroth ef al., 1993), Natural savannahs occur in
intermediate situations, where the combination is
favoured (Eagleson and Segarra, 1985; Haxeltine et
al., 1996). Changes in rainfall seasonality, as well as
changes in land management, would affect the
tree-grass balance.

(3) Seasonal shifts between C; and C, grass dominance
(Groves and Williams, 1981) occur because C, plants
have a higher light use efficiency than C, plants
wherever temperatures exceed a threshold of about
22°C, at current CO, concentration (Ehleringer and
Monson, 1993). An increase in atmospheric CO,
raises this temperature threshold (Drake, 1992b; Arp
et al., 1993; Johnson et al., 1993). Warming should
therefore favour C,, but increasing CO, may favour
C;. Increasing CO, might have caused the recent
invasion of some C, grasslands by C, woody plants
(e.g., Johnson et al., 1993), although other factors
such as land-use changes may be involved as well

years, have been established from palaeoecology (Prentice,
1986; Bennett, 1986; Huntley, 1988; Davis, 1990; Webb,
1992). For perennial plants, the evolution of new
adaptations is too slow to be an effective response. Instead,
changes occur both in the local abundances of species and
genotypes (Type A response, Webb, 1986) and in the
geographic distributions of species (Type B response)
(Figure 9.3). In this process biomes do not change or move
en bloc, instead, species react to climate change
individually according to their biology. When climate
changes to produce novel regional climates, novel
associations of plants arise (Webb, 1992), Successive
interglacial periods have therefore been characterised by
different vegetation assemblages (Watts, 1988). The
general directions of change are predictable from a
knowledge of the climate change and the present-day
climatic tolerances (realised niches) of the species.

The palaeo-record tells us mainly about migration in a
natural matrix. Future migrations may be very different.
For example, the modern landscape provides fewer
regeneration sites. Migrating species in the past exploited
recently disturbed sites, whereas now natural vegetation is
often fragmented (Peters, 1992) and confined to
undisturbed sites. On the other hand, bumans are already
spreading many species beyond their natural ranges both
deliberately and accidentally. Outlier populations spread by
humans could be future infection centres even if they are
not regenerating now (Davis and Zabinski, 1992). The net
effect of human activities on plant species’ ability to
migrate is unclear.

"Faced with climate change, species presumably can (in
the right conditions) spread at least as fast as they have
done before. Species spread (migration) involves a number
of factors including dispersal, regeneration on a suitable
site, growth to maturity and seed production. Dispersal
seems not to have been a major limitation in the past, at
least to the major species detected over the long time-
periods represented in the palaeo-record (see
Biogeographic Dynamics Box). The mechanisms of rapid
spread as observed in the Holocene may involve
coalescence of many populations, each starting from an
“infection centre” which could either be a pre-existing
small population in a favourable microhabitat, or a new
population founded by long-distance seed dispersal (birds,
mammals and tornadoes are possible vectors; see
references in Box). This way, species distribution ranges
could expand orders of magnitude faster than they would if
they advanced along an orderly front.

"‘The Issue of Dispersal Rate

Rates of species spread in response to Holocene climate
changes have been reconstructed by mapping pollen
data from networks of '4C-dated sediment cores. They
range from 50-2000 m/yr for most woody species in
Europe and North America (Davis, 1976; Huntley and
Birks, 1983; Huntley, 1988). The puzzle is how species
could spread so fast. Several explanations have been
offered. For example, the rapid spread of Picea glauca
into interior Canada immediately after deglaciation has
been attributed to long-distance dispersal aided by
strong anticyclonic winds (Ritchie and MacDonald,
1986). Migrations into already-vegetated regions that
appear instantaneous over hundreds of kilometres, such
as the spread of Tsuga into the Great Lakes region in
response to precipitation and winter temperature
increases ~ 7000 yr bp (Prentice et al., 1991b), may be
better described as infilling by the expansion of
scattered “advance populations” (Clark, 1993; Davis,
1983; MacDonald et al., 1993).

In a rapidly changing environment, there may be complex
transient effects including possible releases of carbon due
to climate-change-induced forest die back as mentioned in
Section 9.3.7. At the present time there is no consensus on
the likely magnitude of such releases. In a modelling study,
Smith and Shugart (1993) began to explore how large they
might be. In Smith and Shugart’s model, climate-induced
vegetation redistribution initially led to a large transient
release of about 200 GtC during 100-200 years due to die
back of forests. While an important conceptual advance,
this transient analysis contains many crude assumptions
such as very long lags due to slow migration. This estimate
probably represents an upper bound to the effect of biome
shifts alone in causing a transient loss of carbon from the
terrestrial biosphere. Such losses would be expected to
depend strongly on the rate of climate change; that is, the
faster the rate of climate change, the greater the likelihood
of large carbon losses from terrestrial ecosystems due to
biome shifts during the transient (Woodwell, 1995).

about twice as large as would be expected due to the

Deglaciation increased the area available for vegetation;
however, a similar area of the exposed continental shelf was
flooded. The increase in unglaciated land area from the LGM
to the present was, at most, 2% (Prentice et al, 1993b). The

These variations may reflect a trade-off between the extent
of tropical and high latitude wetlands (Blunier et al., 1995).
Tropical wetlands were most extensive in the early
Holocene due to increased monsoonal precipitation (Petit-
Maire et al., 1991; Street-Perrott, 1992). High latimde
wetlands have increased in extent during the late Holocene
due to decreasing temperatures and evaporation (Ovenden,

result of anaerobic respiration (methanogenesis), and CH,

about 20% to the global emissions of this gas to the

change could either increase or decrease CH, flux from

relative supplies of nitrate and carbon (Firestone and

"The main land-surface parameters influenced by
vegetation structure are surface albedo (normal and snow-
covered), roughness length (affecting boundary-layer
conductance), canopy conductance and rooting depth.
Snow-free surface albedo for total short-wave radiation
ranges from ~0.15 in closed forests to 0.4-0.5 in hot
deserts (Henderson-Sellers and McGuffie, 1987). The
largest effect of snow cover is on low vegetation types such
as grasslands and tundra, where the snow-covered albedo
can be up to 0.8. Roughness length increases with
vegetation height: tall forests therefore present a boundary-
layer conductance that is much larger than short grasslands.
Canopy conductance is influenced by foliage density, plant
nitrogen content, atmospheric CO, content and drought
stress (Schulze et al., 1994). At present ambient CO,, most
natural vegetation types have a maximum stomatal
conductance of 3-6 mm/s while field crops have a higher
conductance, up to 12 mm/s (Kelliher et al., 1993). Canopy
conductance increases asymptotically with leaf area index,
towards a value of about 3-4 times stomatal conductance
for a closed canopy (Schulze er al., 1994), Maximum
stomatal conductance is lowered under increased ambient
CO,. Stomatal closure under midday conditions of high
evaporative demand acts to restrict canopy conductance.
This closure occurs sooner as soil moisture supply is
reduced and vapour pressure deficit increases.

Albedo changes i in the high latitudes can also have major
effects. Bonan et al. (1992) and Chalita and Le Treut
(1994) examined the sensitivity of global climate to boreal
deforestation (replacement of the boreal forests by tundra).
The large increase in snow-covered albedo resulted in
colder winters and a longer snow season. In Bonan et al.’s
study, which included a mixed-layer ocean model, the
thickness and duration of Arctic sea ice was increased and
the cooling thereby extended from winter into summer.
The total effect was felt across the Northern Hemisphere
and summer temperatures became too cold for the
persistence of boreal forests in their present range. Such
sensitivity studies suggest that large biogeophysical effects
of vegetation structure on climate could be brought into
play by land-use change.

"More detailed investigation of biogeophysical feedbacks
requires coupling vegetation models with GCMs
(Henderson-Sellers, 1993; Claussen, 1994). Claussen
(1993) coupled the BIOME model asynchronously to an
GCM, using an iterative procedure: 4-6 year ensembles of
simulated climate were used to modify the biome '
distribution, which in turn modified the climate. The
coupled system proved stable with respect to small
perturbations of the biome distribution, as also found by
Henderson-Sellers (1993). However a very large
perturbation triggered a complex response in the
atmospheric circulation and caused the coupled system to
return to an alternative state in which the south-western
Sahara remained wooded. With 6000 yr bp orbital forcing,
the coupled system approached an even more extreme state
in which most of the Sahara turned to savannah (Claussen

Climate-induced changes in biome distribution would
presumably also cause feedbacks. Palacoclimate
simulations suggest that such feedbacks are important.
Street-Perrott et al. (1990) showed that a GCM with
surface boundary conditions kept as today could simulate
the phenomenon, but not the extent and magnitude, of
African monsoon expansion at 9000 yr bp. When a realistic
expansion of vegetation across the present-day Sahara was
included (via the albedo effect), precipitation increased by
a further ~| mm/day over large areas, including northern
and western regions that were scarcely affected in the
original simulation. Foley et al. (1994) showed that the
warming-induced poleward expansion of boreal forests into
what is now tundra at 6000 yr bp could have doubled the
initial effects of orbital forcing (Figure 9.7). In both
examples, biogeophysical feedbacks amplified the initial
radiative forcing.

In conclusion, biogeophysical feedbacks involve
interactions between the atmosphere and biosphere which
can only be assessed quantitatively through the further
development of coupled models including the terrestrial
biosphere as an integral component of the climate system.
Model sensitivity studies (including palaeoclimate
simulation) suggest that these feedbacks are potentially of
similar magnitude to the direct effects of changes in
radiative forcing.
"	Text
" 

Proper representation of these feedbacks in models
requires a physiologically based representation of the
processes controlling canopy conductance (e.g., Collatz et
al., 1991; Friend and Cox, 1995), a sufficiently resolved
representation of the PBL (e.g., Troen and Mahrt, 1986;
MacNaughton and Jarvis, 1991; Jacobs and de Bruin,
1992), and these elements to be fully interactive in the
GCM. Such a coupling of atmospheric and ecosystem
processes appears to be a high priority because the
potential for future drought is: (a) a key issue in assessing
the biological and societal impacts of global change; and

"Such studies underline the sensitivity of the simulated
hydrological cycle to land-surface properties that are
determined by ecosystem functional and structural
responses to climate and CO). In particular, GCM
simulations of regional changes in soil moisture in a high-
CO, world are questionable because such simulations have
not, as yet, taken into account changes in ecosystem
structure and function that would have major feedback
effects on the hydrological cycle. The uncertainty is
compounded because most current GCMs do not resolve
the vertical structure of the planetary boundary layer
(PBL), which may limit the effect of changes in stomatal
conductance on evapotranspiration (Jarvis and
McNaughton, 1986; Martin, 1989; McNaughton and Jarvis,
1991; Monteith, 1995).

"(Martin et al, 1989; Field et al., 1995). As ambient co,
increases, stomatal conductance declines. GCM sensitivity
studies indicate that a global halving of surface
conductance, with no change in leaf area, would lead to
reduced evapotranspiration rates, increased surface air
warming about 0.5°C averaged over terrestrial areas,
compared with 1.1 to 2.5°C which is predicted for the
combined effects of radiative forcing and aerosols (Chapter
6), and in some regions increase soil moisture storage
(Henderson-Sellers et al., 1995; Pollard and Thompson
1995). This latter effect of CO, could mitigate or even
reverse the mid-latitude drying seen in some 2 X CO,
simulations with fixed surface conductance (Chapter 6).
Compensatory increases in leaf area would work against
the effect of CO,-induced reductions in stomatal
conductance. However, a study with a coupled (single
column) model of the soil-ecosystem-atmosphere system,
including interactive adjustment of leaf area in response to
CO,, suggested that the stomatal conductance response
would dominate over the compensatory leaf area response
(Friend and Cox, 1995). Thus, the net “physiological”
effect of CO, on climate would be to reduce
evapotranspiration and increase soil moisture, relative to
the scenarios based on radiative forcing alone.

Such studies underline the sensitivity of the simulated

"Marine biogeochemical processes both respond to and
influence climate. Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO,) is the
most important greenhouse gas increasing rapidly due to
human activities. The oceans contain about 40,000 GtC in
dissolved, particulate, and living forms. By contrast, land
biota, soils and detritus total about 2200 GtC. Living and
dead biogenic matter in the ocean contains at least 700
GtC, almost equal to the amount of CO, in the atmosphere
(about 750 GtC). The increase in atmospheric carbon since
pre-industrial times (150 GtC) is equivalent to that cycled
through the marine planktonic ecosystem in less than 5
years. Simulation models calibrated with oceanic
observations indicate that instead of the pre-industrial
atmospheric CO, concentration of 280 ppmv, the
atmospheric concentration of CO, would have been 450
ppmvy in the absence of marine biota. Clearly, it is
imperative that we understand the contribution of
biogeochemical processes in maintaining the steady state
functioning of the ocean carbon cycle. In addition to their
importance in the global cycling of CO,, marine organisms
are significant sources of climatically active trace gases,
especially dimethyl sulphide (DMS).

Carbon is considered to be taken up by
phytoplankton during primary production and
released during remineralisation of organic matter in
constant proportion to the major nutrients CorgN:P,
referred to as the Redfield ratios. If these ratios (or
their vertical gradients) change in time in response to
changes in ocean circulation or other properties,
model simulations indicate that there is a large
potential for the biological pump to influence
atmospheric CO, concentrations.

Calcium carbonate (CaCO,) is fixed during
photosynthesis by those marine algae and animals
that have “hard” parts of CaCO,: this CaCO, also
sinks out of the surface layer with the exported
organic carbon, but each molecule removed is
accompanied by creation of a molecule of CO, in the
surface ocean, counteracting the removal of the
organic carbon. Globally, the ratio Copia;
exported from the surface ocean is about 4:1, but a
shift in phytoplankton species causing a shift to a
ratio of 1:1 would neutralise the effect of the
“biological pump” on surface pCO,. At present, we
cannot quantify the probability or extent of such a
shift occurring as a response to climate change.

Biogeochemical processes occur principally in the
top few hundred metres of the sea. The continental
margins play a major, but poorly assessed, role in
oceanic biogeochemical cycling and are the burial

Several critical issues require explicit attention because
of their demonstrated or perceived importance in terms of
feedback to climate. They include: possible responses of
the ocean biological pump and any resulting change in the
rate of CO, cycling; iron fertilisation which might speed up
the biological pump and the draw down of atmospheric
CO,; changes in the production by phytoplankton of
dimethyl sulphide (DMS) which in the atmosphere may
contribute to the production of sulphate aerosols; and
potential consequences of increased ultraviolet radiation in
the wavelength range 280-320 nm (UV-B) on plankton
production and community composition. Climatic variation
has been documented on temporal scales from sub-decadal
(for example, the El Nifio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
phenomenon) to millennia. Most projections in the IPCC
scientific assessments have been for the years 2050 and
2100, so we consider ENSO to century time-scales and
regional to global spatial scales. Physical and
biogeochemical processes, in the very heterogeneous
continental margins especially, vary strongly on regional
scales and must be understood on those scales in order to
determine possible global effects.

"Similarly, the range of space and time-scales over which
individual organisms and populations of organisms exist is
large (Figure 10.1b). The population scales especially
overlap with a wide variety of physical scales and
consequently with physical processes. The range of sizes of
marine biota allow for connections between physical and
biological processes. Therefore, modifications that affect
circulation dynamics can potentially influence a wide range
of biological processes, and modifications that affect
individual biological components have the potential of
cascading throughout the marine food web. Most marine
biotic responses to environmental and climate change that
might have feedbacks to climate involve zooplankton and
smaller organisms. From Figure 10.1b we would expect
that their responses might occur on time-scales of less than
decades. If, for example, the marine biota respond as a
pulse of elevated primary production injecting (mostly as
sinking particles) more organic carbon into the deep ocean,
physical transport processes might then redistribute the
anomalous deep carbon to complete the response, on time-
scales shown schematically in Figure 10.2. These processes
might take considerably longer, especially if the largest
scale mode, the thermohaline circulation, is involved.

requires light, CO, and dissolved nutrients. The rate of
primary production is not controlled by the supply of CO,,
considered to be almost always available in excess of
requirements for marine primary production, but rather by
the supply of new nutrients to the sunlit layer. Total
primary production can be partitioned (over long enough
time-scales) into two fractions: recycled production
supported by nutrients cycled within the sunlit layer of the

entering the sunlit layer of the ocean from land, the

"The global pattern of marine primary production (Figure
10.3, after Berger and Wefer, 1991) shows that much of the
highest production is associated with continental margins.
The regions of enhanced primary production away from
continental margins are generally associated with open
ocean upwelling, such as occurs in equatorial regions, and
with deep winter mixing that entrains more nutrients into
the upper ocean. Open-ocean primary production outside of
upwelling regions tends to be lower, but extends over much
larger areas. The nutrients coming from the ocean interior
must be supplied by vertical exchange processes that
operate on shorter space and time-scales than the
thermohaline circulation (Figure 10.2). Berger and Wefer
(1991) took the pattern of vertically exported primary
production to be identical with (but not linearly
proportional to) that of total primary production, with the
largest values found along the continental margins; their
pattern is remarkably similar to the annual average pattern
of Ekman upwelling in Xie and Hsieh (1995), suggesting a
strong dependence on wind- driven n upwelling.

"The “biological carbon pump” refers to the process by
which export production removes carbon from the ocean
surface layer to the ocean interior, as sinking organic
particles and as dissolved organic matter transported by
ocean currents. Eventually this carbon is “remineralised”
by bacteria at depth into dissolved inorganic form, except
for a small fraction that is buried in the sediments. Thus,
the biological pump reduces the total carbon dioxide in the
ocean surface layer (and the atmosphere) and increases the
total carbon content in the deep ocean. For pre-industrial
equilibrium conditions (atmospheric concentration of CO,:
~280 ppmv), model simulations indicate that a fully
efficient biological pump (using all available surface
nutrients) would result in an atmospheric CO, level of
~160 ppmv, whereas extinction of all marine production
would lead to a level of ~450 ppmv (e.g., Sarmiento and
Toggweiler, 1984, Shaffer, 1993). However, the biological
pump is considered to have been roughly in steady state
over the last century, unaffected by the increase in CO,

If much of ‘the global oceanic primary production results
from upwelling of waters shallower than 200 m, there are
two ramifications. First, if climate-induced changes in ocean
circulation patterns change the supply of nutrients to the
ocean surface layer, the time-scale involved for this and the
biological response might be decades rather than centuries.
This time-scale is comparable with the 2050 and 2100
projections of interest to policymakers, and hence the
possible response of the marine biota and potential for
feedback to climate merit attention. Second, the contribution

changes in ocean circulation, or in inputs from land and the
atmosphere, that affect the supply of new nutrients to the
sunlit upper ocean (and the production of export carbon),
then the rate of sequestering of carbon by the biological
pump could change with possible feedbacks to the build-up

changes cause changes in the Redfield ratios, then more or
less carbon would be transferred by the biological pump
for each unit of nutrient, again with possible implications

The quality and quantity of radiation can also be altered
by climate change, directly affecting marine organisms.
Between 1930 and 1981 the total cloud amount over
Northern Hemisphere oceans increased by 6% (Parungo et
al., 1994), which must affect total incoming solar radiation,
the spectral distribution of the incoming radiation, and the
amount of outgoing radiation. Primary production by
marine phytoplankton depends both on the amount and the
spectral composition of the incoming solar radiation. Given
that primary production might be linearly dependent on
light levels much of the time when there are sufficient
nutrients, we would expect a 6% increase in cloudiness to
result in a decrease in primary production but somewhat
less than that amount, perhaps a few per cent. However, the
distinction between short term physiological response, and
biogeochemically-significant community response remains

marine ecosystems are those associated with wind-driven

other possible feedbacks might explain these trends. On

consisting of changes in community composition rather than
in altered rates of the original species. For this reason a
direct correlation between temperature and community
production cannot be drawn. Changes consistent with
climate warming have been reported by Barry et al. (1995)
in the invertebrate fauna of an intertidal community, and by
Roemmich and McGowan (1995) in zooplankton biomass
over the continental shelf. Temperature-induced change in
biological rates or ecosystem structure may impact carbon
cycling in the ocean by modifying the biological carbon
pump. Furthermore, as shown by Figure 10.1, impacts that
occur at one size class of organism can transfer to those
above and below, thereby potentially affecting all

In summary, the marine biota and their environment
interact on a wide variety of space and time-scales.
Especially productive areas are on continental margins and
along the equator because of the input of new nutrients
from land, from the atmosphere, and mostly from the ocean
interior via upwelling. Climate change can affect marine
biota by changing temperatures altering physiological rates
and/or community composition, by changing radiation
affecting biological production or damaging cells, and by

A number of climate change s scenarios suggest that
temperature changes would be greatest at high latitudes
(see Section 6.2.2.3). Jacka and Budd (1991), for example,
have documented the sensitivity of Antarctic sea ice to
warming. The seasonal development and regression of sea
ice is of substantial biological importance in addition to its
profound role in global ocean-atmosphere exchange of
heat, water and gases. Blooms of phytoplankton at the ice
edge, induced by upwelling of nutrient-rich water and/or
the stabilising effect of melting ice-water, are significant at
high latitudes in both hemispheres. Changes in the extent
and thickness of the ice affect the timing, magnitude and
duration of the seasonal pulse of primary production in
polar regions, while the mode of sea ice formation
influences the composition of the biota associated with it.
This in turn affects the quantity and quality of food
available to grazers and the timing and the magnitude of
vertical flux of carbon and other elements (Eicken, 1992),
Again, recent findings by Gloersen (1995) indicate that sea
ice extent in both hemispheres correlates with ENSO
cycles.

Other hypotheses to explain the glacial drawdown of
atmospheric CO, with the potential for change on decade
to century time-scales have been simulated in an ocean
general circulation model (GCM) by Heinze et al. (1991).
They include increased Redfield ratios of C:N or C:P,
increased ocean nutrient inventory causing increased
production of particulate organic carbon (POC), increased
high latitude primary production, changes in the
“ventilation” of deep waters (i.e., a shallower thermocline
circulation), and changes in the proportion of production
by phytoplankton of CaCO3 relative to organic carbon.
Heinze et al. found that their model was most sensitive to
changes in Redfield ratios, ventilation, and changes in the
inventories of nutrients or POC. Qualitative consistency
with palaeoceanographic data was greatest for changes in
Redfield ratios and in the oceanic inventory of POC. In the
next sections, we will consider the potential for marine
biotic responses in these processes, and in processes where
there is potential for feedbacks to climate through related
biogeochemical processes. Two examples of the latter are:
(i) Increases in POC on continental shelves could lead to
increased anoxia and loss of nitrogen to the atmosphere by
denitrification, and reduced production of POC (e.g.,
Christensen, 1994). (ii) A shift to CaCO,-fixing
phytoplankton (Coccolithophores) would increase both
surface pCO,, the marine production of DMS (with a
possible increase in marine cloudiness), and the near-
surface reflectance of visible light with possible increases
in sea surface reflectance or near surface temperatures
(e.g., Holligan, 1992).

We are concerned here with potential feedbacks to climate

particular, how might changes in the marine biota in
response to changing climate affect the atmospheric
distributions of radiatively active gases? In addition to
maintaining a reduced concentration of CO, in the surface
ocean (relative to the ocean interior), marine biota are a
significant source of NO, another greenhouse gas, and of
dimethyl sulphide (DMS), which when ventilated to the
atmosphere can form cloud condensation nuclei. Several
critical issues (CO, cycling via the biological pump, the
role of iron in sequestering carbon to the deep ocean, DMS

Globally, marine plants are responsible for more than a
third of the total gross photosynthetic production that
incorporates carbon from CO, into organic molecules; the
other photosynthesis is accomplished by terrestrial plants.
On an annual basis, the gross rate of carbon fixation by
marine algae (phytoplankton) may be as high as 50 GtC/yr,
of which more than half is supported by nutrients recycled
within the euphotic layer, and the rest supported by new
nutrients introduced into the euphotic zone, primarily from

subduction or convective sinking of surface waters.
Organic matter that reaches great depths is returned mostly

coastal and equatorial upwelling, deep winter convective

Related to the biological pump (or part of it depending
on the definition) is the uptake of carbon by those marine
algae and animals that have “hard” parts constructed of
calcium carbonate. This CaCO, sinks out of the euphotic
zone with the export production. Globally, | carbon atom
is incorporated by calcareous phytoplankton into CaCO,
for about every 4 carbon atoms into organic molecules
(Broecker and Peng, 1982; Tsunogai and Noriki, 1991), but
the ratio can be 1:1 in areas with blooms of certain
coccolithophores (Robertson et al., 1994), The CaCO,
particles do not remineralise during sinking; rather they
mostly redissolve at depths of several thousands of metres
(e.g., Tsunogai and Noriki, 1991; Anderson and Sarmiento,
1994), although some must obviously settle on the sea
floor, such as ocean ridges where the bottom is above the
dissolution horizon, i.e., the depth (differing in different
oceans) below which sinking CaCO, particles would tend
to redissolve (Broecker and Peng, 1982). Factors
controlling the CaCO, component of photosynthesis have
not been well studied, but efforts are under way to develop
a quantitative basis for assessment (e.g., Holligan et al.,

alone, which also resulted in the undersaturation of surface
waters being less pronounced. Palaeo-oceanographic
evidence suggests changes in the carbonate cycle
influenced atmospheric CO, changes that accompanied
glacial-interglacial periods. Boyle (1988) argued that
during the last glacial maximum a shift in labile nutrients
and metabolic CO, to greater depths increased the
dissolved CO, raising the depth horizon below which
CaCO, would dissolve. The increased Ca2* slowly raised
the alkalinity of the whole ocean, lowering the surface
pCO, and reducing atmospheric CO, concentrations.
During the last deglaciation, the change in the locus of
carbonate production in the ocean from the deep sea
(pelagic carbonates) to the continental shelves (coral reefs)
following the rise in sea level (the coral reef hypothesis)
has been suggested as a cause of the increase in the
atmospheric pCO, level (Berger, 1982). Total atmospheric
pCO, change due to this effect has been shown from
modelling to approximate that observed in the Vostok ice
core (Opdyke and Walker, 1992). However, another model,
based on the hypothesis that a change in the relative rates
at which organic carbon and calcium carbonate are
deposited on the sea floor should drive a compensating
change in ocean pH, also offers an explanation of the last
deglaciation (Archer and Maier-Reimer, 1994),

tenfold increase of anthropogenic nitrogen loading to the
coastal zone had already occurred by 1980, accounting for
roughly half (0.4-0.5 GtC/yr) of the export to the
continental slope regions, and Paerl (1993) estimated that
atmospheric depositon of anthropogenic nitrogen

“biotically mediated gas evasion” back to the atmosphere.

atmospheric deposition of nutrient nitrogen to the oceans to
be about 30 TgN/yr. Schindler and Bayley (1993) estimated
another 21 TgN/yr from riverine input. Using a C:N atomic

they assumed was due to human activities. Galloway et al.

estimating a nitrogen input from human activities to the

TgN/yr via rivers. A C:N atomic ratio of 7 gives (for the
total 24 TgN/yr) an equivalent fertilised carbon production

export production. However a C:N ratio of ~10 as found by
Sambrotto et al. (1993) would yield an equivalent fertilised

Under the present climate, Southern Ocean
phytoplankton productivity is assumed to be limited by
lack of iron, since macro-nutrients in the surface layer there
are apparently only rarely depleted (Lizotte and Sullivan,

regions — the subarctic North Pacific Ocean and the eastern
Equatorial Pacific. Thus, Martin (1990) hypothesised that

primary production there to use up the large supply of
nutrients and at the same time reduce the future rate of

several unknowns in this strategy: firstly, would the

Although experiments conducted in small laboratory
containers suggest that addition of iron stimulates
phytoplankton growth, it is difficult to apply these results
to the ocean because the very nature of container
experiments precludes heterotrophic grazers and mixing,
both factors which limit productivity in the ocean (Banse,
1991). To test this hypothesis in the ocean, acidified iron
sulphate tagged with an inert chemical tracer was added to
an area of 64 km? in the equatorial Pacific Ocean in
October 1993 (Kolber et al., 1994; Martin et al., 1994;
Watson et al., 1994). Early results suggest that while the
addition of iron had an easily measurable effect on the
marine ecosystem (with an approximate threefold increase
in both productivity and chlorophyll concentrations), it had
only a small effect on the carbon dioxide levels. After a
brief disequilibrium the ecosystem apparently responded
by recycling carbon rapidly back to the inorganic form,
although there was evidence that the whole patch sunk out
of the surface layer after several days A second fertilisation
experiment was conducted in the same area in May 1995
with more positive results, but the Equatorial Pacific is not
a likely site for a purposeful widespread iron fertilisation

"DMS is the dominant volatile sulpbur-containing
compound in the oceans and the major natural source of
sulphur to the atmosphere (Bates e¢ al., 1992; Liss and
Galloway, 1993). Rough global estimates suggest that
DMS emissions to the atmosphere are approximately 25
TgS/yr, compared with estimates of sulphate (from sulphur
dioxide) of 10 TgS/yr from volcanoes and 75 TgS/yr from
fossil fuels. Sulphur emissions in the Southern Hemisphere
are clearly dominated by oceanic DMS. When ventilated to
the atmosphere, DMS is oxidised to produce aerosol
particles which affect the radiative properties of marine
stratus clouds and thereby affect climate (Charlson et al.,
1987). Although the magnitude of this effect is highly
uncertain, Charlson et al. calculated that a 30% increase in
the number of particles serving as cloud condensation
nuclei (CCN) in marine stratiform clouds would decrease
the global-average surface temperature of the Earth by
1.3°C. Correlations between DMS and CCN have been
observed (Ayers and Gras, 1991; Hegg et al., 1991;
Andreae ef al., 1995), although the processes controlling
the formation and growth of particles in the marine
boundary layer are still controversial. Furthermore, Boers

remineralisation (oxidation by bacteria) of the increased
rain of organic matter out of the euphotic layer. Fuhrman

consequences of oceanic iron fertilisation, including
changes in DMS production and possible consequences of
widespread subsurface decrease in oxygen concentrations.
In fact, in the 1993 iron enrichment study, Martin e al.
(1994) observed a significant increase within the enriched
patch in particulate DMSP (dimethyl! sulphoniopropionate),
the precursor to DMS (see Section 10.3.4). In addition, if
oxygen concentrations were to become severely depleted,
anoxic bacterial processes such as denitrification, sulphate
reduction and methanogenesis could increase in
importance. Denitrification would result in loss of nitrate,
counteracting the fertilisation, and methanogenesis could
lead to additional release from the oceans of another
important greenhouse gas, methane (CH,) (see Section
10.3.5.1). The formation and release of N,0 to the
atmosphere could be increased by the increased
remineralisation of nitrogen compounds caused by the
increased primary production resulting from the iron
fertilisation. Using the fact that the per molecule Global
Warming Potential for N,O is about 300 times that of CO,
on the 20 to 100 year time horizon (IPCC, 1994), and the
results of the model simulations by Joos et al. (1991),

establishing these correlations is that the production of the
DMS precursor, dimethyl! sulphoniopropionate (DMSP), is
highly species specific. Prymnesiophytes, including
coccolithophorids and Phaeocystis, and some
dinoflagellates produce orders of magnitude more DMSP

coastal waters (Turner et al., 1988). Another complicating
factor in modelling DMS concentrations is that the
conversion of DMSP to DMS is often associated with the

activity was inhibited by around 70%. Production of
extracellular enzymes was reduced by UV-B exposure, but
photolysis of these enzymes in solution accounted for the
largest diminution of activity.

"UV-B radiation penetrates to ecologically significant
depths of the ocean, i.e., 10% of surface UV radiation can
penetrate to depths of 5 to 25 m (Smith and Baker, 1989).
Incubations of phytoplankton under both natural and
laboratory sources of UV-B radiation result in species-
specific reduced productivity, growth and reproduction,
nitrogen metabolism and motility. As a consequence,
changes in community structure favouring those organisms
that are more tolerant of UV would be expected. A better
understanding of the nature and magnitude of these
changes requires further work to elucidate the
photobiology of key species. In addition, the eggs and
larval stages of invertebrates and fish have been shown to
be sensitive to UV-B exposure (Hunter et al., 1981;

Inhibition of phytoplanktonic photosynthesis results
from exposure to UV-A (wavelengths 320-400 nm) and
PAR (photosynthetically available radiation: 400-700 nm)
as well as UV-B. Helbling et al. (1992) reported that UV-A
was responsible for over 50% of the photo-inhibition, with
wavelengths shorter than 305 nm accounting for 15-20% of
the inhibition. The action spectrum, or biological weighting
function of UV inhibition of photosynthesis, varies with
both the absolute amount and the ratio of UV-B:UV-
A+PAR but not UV:PAR (Neale ez al., 1994). Tropical
phytoplankton exhibit substantially higher resistance to UV
exposure than Antarctic organisms. However,
phytoplankton from below the mixed layer in Antarctic
waters appear to be more tolerant of solar radiation than
organisms from below the mixed layer in tropical waters.
This is likely to be due to the relative instability and deeper
mixing in the Southern Ocean and the photo-adaptive
processes of these organisms from surface waters. Vertical
mixing plays a crucial role in mitigating photo-inhibition
and UV-B exposure.

largest diminution of activity.

Most of the work on the impacts of UV-B on natural
systems has concentrated on living organisms with only
relatively few studies on the effect of UV photolysis on
dissolved organic and inorganic material. Oceanic DOC is
one of the largest reservoirs of carbon on Earth; yet the
processes regulating the cycling of this material are not well
understood. It is estimated that some 15% of marine DOC
exists as humic substances, assumed to be slowly
degradable macromolecules. However, the bulk of oceanic
DOC appears to be comprised of small molecules
(molecular weight less than 1000 daltons), relatively
unavailable to microorganisms (Amon and Benner, 1994).
Aquatic refractory macromolecules can be photochemically
degraded by sunlight into biologically labile compounds
(Kieber et al., 1989). Mopper et al. (1991) proposed that
such photochemical degradation is the rate limiting step for
the removal of a large fraction of oceanic DOC, and it is
assumed that this will increase under increased solar UV-B
flux. Recently, this has lead to heightened interest in this
phenomenon, although the implications of such
photochemical degradation of organic matter in sea water
had been discussed in the late 1970s (Duursma and
Dawson, 1981, and papers therein), One of the difficulties
in extrapolating trends from the work done to date in the
world ocean is the different nature of the DOC pools
investigated. Several studies have concentrated on coastal
waters where terrestrially derived organic matter may be
more susceptible to photodegradation than purely marine
DOC (Moran and Hodson, 1994). Others have worked on
samples from deep or oligotrophic waters, and Mopper et
al. (1991) proposed that the photodegradable fraction of the
DOC might originate from sediment porewater. Data from
productive surface waters are lacking, which is surprising
considering the greatest amount of oceanic DOC is
produced by planktonic organisms in this UV-influenced
layer. Thomas and Lara (1995) have shown that algal-
derived DOC is resistant to naturally occurring levels of UV
radiation. This finding cautions against the extrapolation of

the principal consumers of labile DOC. Increased substrate
concentrations could plausibly sustain higher bacterial
activity, leading to accelerated nutrient remineralisation.
However, as previously mentioned, elevated UV-B levels
may also inhibit bacterial activity, resulting in a net
accumulation of labile dissolved organic matter in surface
waters. It is also possible that certain photolytic products
have a toxic or adverse ecophysiological effect
on organisms (McKnight et al., 1990). Although
photochemical degradation of DOC dominates present
thinking, photoreactions may even have an opposite effect,
playing a role in the production of refractory compounds
(Lee and Henrichs, 1993). It is clearly premature to adopt
the scenario of increased UV-B flux causing higher

increased bacterial respiration leading to enhanced

These coupled ocean-atmosphere models include only
the physical climate system. The chemistry and biology of
CO, CaCO, N,O, DMS and other radiatively-active gases
that may alter the efficacy of the greenhouse effect or the
concentration of atmospheric aerosols are not included
explicitly in these coupled models. CO, is included only in
terms of how its atmospheric concentration alters the
strength of the greenhouse effect. The ocean carbon cycle
and how it affects the CO, partial pressure difference
across the air-sea boundary, and hence the air-sea transfer,
is not included. Feedback effects, such as how increasing
temperatures will affect the partial pressures of CO, in the
atmosphere and the ocean, and hence the air-sea fluxes, are
also yet to be included. Initial box models were successful
at demonstrating the probable role of increased high
latitude ocean primary production in reducing the
atmospheric CO, concentrations during glacial periods
(Knox and McElroy, 1984; Sarmiento and Toggweiler,
1984; and Siegenthaler and Wenk, 1984). At present
geochemical cycles have been simulated in 2- and 3-
dimensional ocean GCMs (e.g., Maier-Reimer, 1993;
Drange, 1994; Stocker et al., 1994), and no doubt initial
simulations with coupled models that include active
geochemical cycling are now being undertaken. It is likely
that contemporary limitations on computing power will
limit sensitivity studies. This will constrain the rate of
progress in developing coupled models that will reproduce
an “equilibrium” climate not just of the physical cycles but
also of the biogeochemical cycles. Most present climate
GCMs do not include continental margins or their
processes. These models predict that the largest physical
changes will occur around the model boundaries in some
basins (e.g., the North Atlantic). The effect of these
changes on biological processes related to global
greenhouse gas fluxes and aerosol concentrations needs to
be elucidated. We need to acquire sufficient understanding
of the processes that control the vertical fluxes of climate-
related gases and biogenic particulates (e.g., Erickson,
1993), and to develop improved models of the upper ocean
and its upper and lower boundaries for inclusion in the
future development of multi-disciplinary coupled ocean-
atmosphere models. At present we do not know enough
about the processes governing the production, degradation
and sources of light-sensitive compounds in the upper
ocean, in particular DOC and DMS, to parameterize their

behaviour in these models.

biogeochemical models are rapidly improving, and they

ultimately be determined by the availability of observations

"models of various levels of sophistication (e.g., Shaffer,
1993; Christensen, 1994; Shaffer and Sarmiento, 1995).
Models for investigating marine ecosystems have focused
on understanding or identifying important processes, that is
they are process-oriented models, The majority of the
existing models consider interactions between circulation
and a truncated form of the marine ecosystem. The
circulation component of these models ranges from simple
prescribed conditions (e.g., Fasham et al., 1990) to large-
scale primitive equation general circulation models (e.g.,
Sarmiento et al., 1993; Fasham et al., 1993). The marine
ecosystem representations are generally in terms of
aggregate dynamics, e.g., single terms representing all
phytoplankton or all zooplankton (Wroblewski, 1977;
Wroblewski et al., 1988). However, some attempts have
been made to include realistic size- or stage-structured
phytoplankton and zooplankton population dynamics

bacteria, viruses, protozoa and metazoa interact with the

are interspecific differences both in responses to
environmental conditions and in specific biogeochemical
effects. [t is from this almost infinite multiplicity of
connections that the climatic role of the marine biota
emerges. A further complication is that these interactions
may span a range of time-scales from millisecond to
millennia and beyond, as climate change affects the
molecular biological constitution of the marine biota, and
this in turn feeds back on climate. For an adequate
understanding of the climate system these fundamental
aspects cannot be ignored. The fact that the present models
oversimplify the issue by emphasising bulk effects and
responses of the marine biota further illustrates our limited
understanding of the climate system. However, new
generations of biogeochemical climate models are being

(Hofmann, 1988; Moloney and Field, 1991).

The current generation of models that have been
constructed to consider biogeochemical cycling in the
ocean are limited in application by the inability to prescribe
adequately the temporal and spatial variation in the
parametrizations of biological processes known to exist
over scales of more than a few days and more than tens of
kilometres. Consequently, most of the models consider
regional processes and have been focused on understanding
short-term episodic events such as coastal upwelling. The
few attempts at larger scale applications (North Atlantic
basin) have shown that the solutions degrade over time due
to inadequate representation of the marine ecosystem and
deficiencies in the simulated circulation and mixing
patterns (Sarmiento ef al., 1993: Slater et al., 1993). Efforts
are now being focused on developing algorithms and
parametrizations for biological processes such that they are
valid over larger regions and over longer time-scales
(Evans and Fasham, 1993). In addition, circulation models
are usually constructed to aid in understanding ocean
circulation dynamics: thus, the horizontal and vertical
resolution of these models is usually not adequate for
biogeochemical modelling needs. Also, circulation models
often lack dynamics, such as mixed-layer circulation, that
are important in regulating the flux of biogeochemical
properties. Future advances in modelling of climate effects
on marine systems will require that the circulation and
biogeochemical models be developed together.

Perhaps the strongest limitation at present is the lack of
data that are adequate to formulate, calibrate and evaluate

Since the 1990 Scientific Assessment significant
progress has been made in furthering our
understanding of climate change. The inclusion of
radiative forcing due to aerosols, in particular their
spatial patterns, in climate models has provided the
means to diagnose recent climate warming and given
growing confidence that a significant part of the
observed climate warming can be attributed to
human activities. The global role of aerosols in
climate change to date has begun to be quantified and
provides further confidence in simulations of future
climate change.

Our understanding of the climate system typically
advances on time-scales of 5-10 years and a co-
ordinated spectrum of approaches, ranging from
individual research projects through to global-scale
experiments and observational systems and
infrastructure, is necessary. Lack of support for these
activities will slow advances. An international frame-
work for climate studies (the international Climate
Agenda, including WCRP, IGBP, GCOS) exists.

Complex systems, such as the climate system, can
respond in non-linear ways and produce surprises.
The nature of the system forces us to take a flexible
approach in research planning and societal response
and makes exact predictions of research advances
impossible. Although, by definition, surprises cannot
be anticipated, non-traditional, multi-scale, multi-
disciplinary and multi-institutional research efforts
with supporting organisational infrastructure are the
best means of addressing them. There is a need for
continual re-assessment of climate change and

These tentative projections will aid policymakers in
deciding on actions to mitigate or adapt to anthropogenic
climatic change, which will need to be re-assessed on a
regular basis. It is recognised that many remaining
uncertainties need to be reduced in each of the above-
named disciplines, which is why IPCC projections and
scenarios are often expressed with upper and lower limits.
These ranges are based on the collective judgement of the
IPCC authors and the reviewers of each chapter, but it may
be appropriate in the future to draw on formal methods
from the discipline of decision analysis to achieve more
consistency in setting criteria for high and low range limits.

Chapters | to 10 of this report examine the state of

outline the individual research activities and national and
internationally co-ordinated programmes needed to
advance our understanding. It should be noted that each
increment of better understanding may not necessarily
reduce uncertainties, at least initially. Eventually, however,
such increased understanding should help to narrow
uncertainties, i.e., to move the high and low range limits
closer together. Further, we pay attention to areas where
currently imaginable but highly uncertain “surprise”
outcomes may exist. One “surprise” could be that elements
of the climate system are inherently unpredictable;
however, evaluation exercises indicate that many

Scientific knowledge from a wide range of disciplines
needs to be gathered and integrated to fashion scenarios of
potential anthropogenic climatic changes over the next
century. The process begins with projecting population
growth, living standards and the technologies that will be
used to achieve them. This information is used to produce
scenarios of greenhouse gas and other chemical emissions
such as sulphur dioxide, as well as projected land-use
changes, which can affect the flows of energy and
constituents between the atmosphere and the surface. This
effort necessitates input from the natural, social and
engineering and other applied sciences and, within the
IPCC, is the domain of Working Group IIL. It provides a
basis for model predictions of the atmospheric
concentrations of radiatively active gases and aerosols as a
function of time and location. Then meteorology,
oceanography, hydrology, ecology, glaciology and other
natural science disciplines are called upon to calculate
potential climatic responses to concentrations derived from
a wide range of plausible emission and land-use change
scenarios. Review of this work is the domain of IPCC
Working Group I and hence the subject of this report. The
climate projections are then used to produce estimates of a
range of plausible environmental and societal impacts (the
domain of IPCC Working Groups If and III). In so far as
those impacts on marine or terrestrial ecosystems may have
feedback effects on climate, they are treated by Working
Group I.

Continued monitoring of the atmospheric concentrations
of the main greenhouse gases is needed in order to identify
long-term trends and establish annual cycles and year-to-
year variability. It is clear that changes in both tropospheric
and stratospheric ozone play important roles in the
radiative balance. Measurements of ozone, nitrogen oxides,
carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons are needed to estimate
global distributions of the short-lived hydroxyl radical,
OH, since direct measurements are unlikely to be possible
for some time to come. The OH radical is important for the

For the global carbon cycle, the key question is whether
anthropogenic emissions will remain in the atmosphere or
be taken up by oceanic or terrestrial ecosystems. Is the
uptake limited absolutely or will it be some continuing
constant fraction of anthropogenic emissions? How will
natural variability change the uptake? Will the effective
lifetime of carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere change
as the climate warms? These are the types of question that
must be answered to reduce uncertainties in the
computation of future atmospheric carbon dioxide
concentrations for a given emission scenario. For methane,
it is also important to understand the complex chemical
feedbacks in order to determine the response time of a

methane perturbation.

The direct radiative cooling effect of tropospheric

"Atmospheric aerosols (Chapter 2) also play an important
role in the Earth’s radiative budget. There are fairly reliable
estimates of the amount of sulphur burned but these do not
translate directly into number density of aerosols, for
which the size, hygroscopic and optical properties, as well
as their vertical, horizontal and temporal distributions, have
not been well observed. Emissions of anthropogenic
sulphate emissions are estimated to be larger than natural
emissions in the Northern Hemisphere and smaller in the
Southern Hemisphere. Biomass and industrial burning are
also important sources of non-sulphate aerosols, such as
those containing black carbon, which can lead to local
heating. Over the oceans, where aerosol influences on
clouds may be particularly important, natural emissions
play a larger role. Quantifying the atmospheric sulphur
budget requires accounting for dimethy] sulphide (DMS)
generated by phytoplankton, primarily at high latitudes and
in coastal areas. Even the direction of possible feedback

Traditional global maps of oceanic productivity (Chapter
10) show that the most intense primary productivity occurs
along the continental margins. Two important scientific
questions arise. First, the fixation of carbon from CO,
depends on the supply of nutrients, a significant fraction of
which comes from upwelling from depths less than 500 m.
Changes in ocean circulation that would alter the nutrient
supply can occur on time-scales of weeks to decades. Thus,
there is potential for significant change in the biological
carbon pump in response to climate-induced change on
time-scales relevant over the next century. Second,
assessments of global scale removal of carbon from the
surface via the biological pump concentrate on the open
ocean, and the difficult assessment of the potentially
Significant contribution along the continental margins
(integrated up to the global scale) had been largely ignored
until recently. New estimates of the biogenic flux and the
effect of a 10% variation (in response to oceanic
circulation variations) suggest that the functioning of the
biological pump requires careful quantitative assessment.

For a given atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases
and aerosols, what will be the resulting additional radiative
forcing? Computation of direct radiative forcing requires
information on the distribution and radiative properties of
the additional greenhouse gases and aerosols (Chapter 2).
There is also indirect forcing due to the production or
destruction of other greenhouse gases by chemical reaction
or, in the case of aerosols, through effects on the radiative
properties of clouds. Clouds themselves play a critical role
in radiative forcing (Chapter 4); cloud feedback will be
discussed in Section 11.6. Generally, the confidence level
in the computation of the direct radiative forcing due to
greenhouse gases is high. The indirect effects of
greenhouse gases, mainly due to their influences on both
stratospheric and tropospheric ozone, is generally small,
but the confidence in these computations is low (more than
50% uncertainty). Research is needed into the radiative
properties of newly produced chemical compounds (e.g.,
hydrochloro-fluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluoro-
carbons (HFCs)) and on the chemical and dynamical
processes that define the indirect effects of various
greenhouse gases. The influence of solar variability is also
thought to be smail but the confidence level is very low.

"A combination of focused process studies and model
development, validation and application, linked to the
continued global monitoring of gases and relevant isotopes
is needed to better quantify the cycles of carbon dioxide
and other greenhouse gases. Reconstruction of the regional
terrestrial carbon balance from the historical period through
to present and the future, including the annual cycle,
requires ecosystem models of the transient terrestrial
ecosystem (Chapter 9), that include both biogeochemistry
and vegetation redistribution. These will permit quantitative
estimates of land-atmosphere carbon dioxide exchange and
biophysical feedbacks to the global climate. The impacts of
forest regrowth on the carbon cycle needs to be better
quantified. In order to complete these reconstructions, it
will be necessary to have an expanded soils’ data base and
maps of land cover/land-use and vegetative carbon stocks
for historical, contemporary and future periods. Because
nitrogen plays a major role in vegetation dynamics,
estimates of nitrogen (both oxidised and reduced)
depositions to regional ecosystems are needed for the
periods of consideration. Recognising that it is impossible
to monitor in detail the global ecosystem, it is important to
define key indices and to establish permanent monitoring
plots. Process studies are needed to improve representation
of processes, both those resolved and especially those on
sub-grid scales, through better parametrizations in models
of the important processes of whole ecosystem co,
fertilisation (alone and with simultaneous warming and
nitrate inputs) and to understand how ecosystems respond
to changing carbon and nitrogen inputs.

For policy considerations, the concept of a global
warming potential (GWP) is useful in comparing the
effects of various emission scenarios for different gases
with lifetimes sufficiently long (2 yrs approximately) to
become well-mixed in the atmosphere. In addition to the
comparative radiative properties of constituents, it is
important to know their lifetime in the atmosphere. GWPs
have an uncertainty of about + 35%. For aerosols, short-
lived gases and the indirect effects through chemical
reactions, there is need for an approach beyond the GWP.

"To document how global and regional climates are
changing and to evaluate and improve models and the
processes incorporated in models, global data sets are
required. These should include the history of the external
forcing of the climate system for model sensitivity and
validation studies. Furthermore, better coverage, the use of
model assimilation to identify key data requirements,
improved data archaeology and rescue, and the removal of
inhomogeneities in historical and future data are necessary.
Finally, it is vital for long time-series data records to be
maintained when they are relevant to the substantiation of
global change.

global change.

Estimates of climate sensitivity (Chapters 4, 5 and 6),
have remained unaltered since the 1990 IPCC Assessment,
at between 1.5 and 4.5°C. Uncertainties in modelling
cloud-radiation interactions are the largest factor in
determining this range. It needs to be noted that this
estimate of warming is based on models of the physical
climate system and does not include biogeochemical
responses. To narrow this range will require improved
understanding and improved models, incorporating
improved parametrizations and numerical procedures. It
will probably require at least a decade more of monitoring
key variables, such as atmospheric and oceanic
temperatures, precipitation, and surface solar radiation,
both to document actual changes and to validate the models
and the processes incorporated therein.

"Given altered radiative forcing, how will the climate
system respond to this changed energy input? Although
feedbacks within the climate system (Chapter 1) appear to
amplify the initial greenhouse radiative forcing, mainly due
to interactions of radiation and the water cycle, our
understanding of these feedbacks is relatively poor.
Because interactions within the climate system are non-
linear, important questions surround the predictability of
the responses and the best means of separating the signal
(the response due to altered radiative forcing) from the
natural variability of the system. Uncertainties (Chapters 4,
5, 6, 9 and 10) in predictions of the magnitude of climate
warming arise owing to the complex nature of the
interactions of water vapour, clouds and aerosols with
radiation, as well as from the neglect of feedbacks from
biogeochemical systems.

"the uncertainty in aerosol radiative forcing is the largest
source of uncertainty in the total radiative forcing of
climate over the past industrial period. Since aerosols are
very patchy in their distribution, they could create
significant regional climate changes regardless of their
effect on globally averaged forcing. There is an array of
scientific issues that needs to be resolved, including the
horizontal, vertical and temporal distributions of aerosols
and their optical properties. Because of the short lifetimes
of most aerosols (days relative to decades for the main
greenhouse gases), aerosols may become a decreasingly
important global problem in the long term if countries
adopt policies of low sulphur emission. It is important that
the role of aerosols, including those of volcanic origin, be
better understood in order to determine their current and
future role in masking climate changes due to increasing
greenhouse gases and to understand potential regional
effects. Finally, the effect of land-use changes on surface
albedo and vegetation needs to be considered in the context
of changes in the regional radiation budget and

Whereas the feedback processes involving the
atmosphere and its interactions with the surface are the
chief factors in determining the equilibrium sensitivity of
the climate system, the ocean plays the major role in
determining the response time of the climate system and is
important for regional impacts of climate change. Although
ocean modelling has advanced considerably in the past few
years, there are still difficulties in modelling phenomena
such as temperature and salinity in deep waters, narrow
boundary currents, oceanic eddies and details of the
thermohaline circulation. Because global heat transport and
storage are essential for regional assessment of climate
change, it is important to determine the extent to which
these omissions affect the simulation skill. Recent
comparisons of model simulations with new tracer data sets
gathered as part of the World Ocean Circulation
Experiment are exposing these deficiencies and allowing
new parametrizations to be tested. Another concern is that
many coupled atmosphere-ocean models use energy, salt
and water flux adjustments to keep the models’ control
simulations closer to the present climate. Until model sub-
components are improved to the extent that flux
adjustments are not needed, it is important to investigate

To detect and attribute human-induced climatic change,
it is necessary to account for the regional components of all
significant climatic forcings (e.g., sulphate or biomass
burning aerosols, land-use changes and tropospheric
ozone) since such forcings can produce unique regional
and altitudinal climatic response patterns (i.e.,
“fingerprints”). When such fingerprints occur in both
modelled and actual climates, increased confidence in
cause and effect linkages is justified. It is also necessary to
determine the likelihood that such patterns may have
occurred by chance.

"For coupled ocean-atmosphere-land surface modelling,
narrowing uncertainties is a process going far beyond
direct model improvements. Dedicated climate process
studies are needed in order to improve parametrizations.
Models with better physical, biological and

the horizontal and vertical are needed in order to resolve
land-surface heterogeneity, synoptic-scale disturbances in
the ocean and to include mesoscale feedbacks, especially
of the tropical atmosphere. The following are priority

"It is important to understand how natural climate variations
interact with human-induced changes (Chapter 8). There are
several issues here. First, as already noted, there needs to be
a continuing high quality global climate monitoring system
to better establish the changing state of the climate. Then, we
must know how the climate system varies in the absence of
anthropogenic forcing. For example, a better understanding
of El Nifio should include the factors that determine its
variable intensity and frequency. El Nifio may be affected by
anthropogenic climate change. Through better observations,
palaeo-reconstructions and improved knowledge and
understanding of natural variability, it will be possible to detect
the anthropogenic climate signal with greater confidence.

"In the long run, we need to be able to use given emission
scenarios to calculate greenhouse gas concentrations within
Earth system (atmosphere-ocean-ice-land surface-biota)
models and obtain time-evolving scenarios of changes. It
should be anticipated that the behaviour of such coupled
non-linear systems may well produce unexpected responses
(Le., “surprises”) that might not have been uncovered by
studying each sub-system in isolation. For example,
coupled atmosphere-ocean models have already revealed
highly non-linear behaviour during the approach to
equilibrium. Furthermore, the palaeo-climatic record
indicates a number of very rapid climatic and trace gas
changes, and it is important to know whether similar events
could be triggered by anthropogenic forcing.

The scientific community is now starting to use low-
frequency (decadal-to-century time-scale) internal
variability generated by fully coupled global climate
models to determine the probability that a trend of a given
magnitude (such as the ~0.5°C in observed global mean
surface temperature increase over the past 100 years;
Chapter 3) could have been generated by natural internal
variability alone. The issue of detection must also include
attribution of observed variability to other known forcings,
such as volcanoes and solar variability. Noise information
from long control runs of coupled-models has the
advantage of being spatially complete and available for
virtually any climate parameter of interest. However, the
effect of artificial corrections, such as flux adjustments, on
the conclusions, is generally unknown.

"To build confidence in the decade-to-century time-scale
natural variability simulated by models, there is a need to
compare model attempts to mimic the climate of the last
1000 years with variability estimates from palaeo-climate
data with comparable time resolution. Reconstructions of
the near surface temperature of the past 1000 years based
on such proxies as tree rings, ice cores and corals are
valuable but have their own inherent deficiencies. Further
complications are added by the need to identify the
forcings, for example solar, volcanoes, deforestation, that
may have taken place over this time period. Nevertheless,
model control runs make specific “predictions” concerning
the variation of surface temperature on a wide range of
space and time-scales. They imply phase lags and leads at
very large spatial scales which are potentially testable
given appropriate palaeo-data.

operation across appropriate disciplines is fostered, and
standardised methods and intercomparisons contribute to
enhancing the Programmes’ output. As noted, much
essential climate research is being done, and is best done,
by individuals or in small research groups at universities or
governmental institutes, around the world. The WCRP,
IGBP and GCOS function through international co-

on the premise that the co-ordinated whole will be worth
more than the sum of the individual elements. Through
these and related programmes, considerable progress has
been made in understanding the climate system, through a
balanced set of monitoring, process studies and modelling

"Since the completion of the 1990 Scientific Assessment,
substantial progress has been made and we are confident
that it will continue. The rate of progress will depend on
the scale of effort and the degree of co-ordination,
particularly for large-scale projects. Because there are
always the elements of good fortune and scientific
breakthroughs which are unpredictable, it is difficult to
place with confidence a time-scale on the advancement of
science and technology. However, the timing of major
international programmes provides an indication. Three
illustrative examples of the time scale for major scientific
undertakings are: first, the completion of the 7-year field
phase of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment in 1997
will give oceanographers the most comprehensive data set
for understanding ocean circulation, model development
and validation. The subsequent scientific analyses of the
data sets generated can be realistically expected to take
place over 5-10 years, at least. Second, clarification of the
important questions of the role of clouds in the energetics
of the atmosphere and testing of models on global cloud
data sets may require global measurements that will only
be possible by a space borne cloud radar coupled with
extensive ground based measurements. The earliest that
such a radar may be launched is after the turn of the
century and scientific analysis will again span a 5-10 year
period. Third, adequate observations to develop and test
refined models of the oceanic carbon cycle will also take
several years (with the successful completion of the JGOFS
observation phase). All of these time lines indicate that
advances in our knowledge of the climate system will take
place gradually but on time-scales of 5-10 years, after
which, depending on progress, more refined studies can be
detined and implemented, also on similar time-scales,

"Climate Change 1995 - The Science of Climate Change is the most comprehensive and up-to-date
assessment available of current scientific understanding of human influences on past, present and
future climate. The IPCC prepared its first comprehensive assessment report in 1990, with subse-
quent supplementary reports in 1992 and 1994. Climate Change 1995 is the first full sequel to the
original assessment.
"	Text
"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was set up jointly by the World Meteorological
Organisation and the United Nations Environment Programme to provide an authoritative international
statement of scientific opinion on climate change. The IPCC’s periodic assessments of the causes,
impacts and possible response strategies to climate change are the most comprehensive and up-to-
date reports on the subject available. These assessments form the standard scientific reference for
all concerned with climate change and its consequences, in academia, government and industry
worldwide. Through three working groups, several hundred international scientists have been
brought together to assess climate change in this Second Scientific Assessment. Each chapter in the
resulting publications is written by teams of lead authors and contributors recognized internationally
as experts in their field. During drafting, the chapters were exposed to extensive review by many
other independent experts. This volume, The Science of Climate Change, is companion to two other
volumes from the IPCC produced under the umbrella title Climate Change 1995 and also published
by Cambridge University Press:

Climate Change 1995 - Impacts, Adaptations and Mitigation of Climate Change: Scientifi-—Technica]
