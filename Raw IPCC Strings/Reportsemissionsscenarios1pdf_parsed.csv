"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios describes new scenarios of
the future, and predicts greenhouse gas emissions associated with such developments. These scenarios are based on a thorough
review of the literature, the development of narrative ""storylines"", and the quantification of these storylines with the help of six
different integrated models from different countries. The scenarios provide the basis for future assessnfents of climate change
and possible response strategies. The report illustrates that future emissions, even in the absence of explicit climate policies,
depend very much on the choices people make: how economies are structured, which energy sources are preferred, and how
people use available land resources. The IPCC published previous greenhouse gas emissions scenarios in 1990 and 1992. The
current scenarios introduce many innovative aspects, such as narrative descriptions of the scenarios, inclusion of information
on the availability of energy technologies, and an analysis of international equity issues.

"In 1992 the IPCC released emission scenarios to be used for
driving global circulation models to develop climate change
scenarios. The so-called IS92 scenarios were pathbreaking.
They were the first global scenarios to provide estimates for the
full suite of greenhouse gases. Much has changed since then in
our understanding of possible future greenhouse gas emissions
and climate change. Therefore the IPCC decided in 1996 to
develop a new set of emissions scenarios which will provide
input to the IPCC third assessment report but can be of broader
use than the JS92 scenarios. The new scenarios provide also
input for evaluating climatic and environmental consequences
of future greenhouse gas emissions and for assessing
alternative mitigation and adaptation strategies, They include
improved emission baselines and latest information on
economic restructuring throughout the world, examine
different rates and trends in technological change and expand
the range of different economic-development pathways,
including narrowing of the income gap between developed and
developing countries. To achieve this a new approach was
adopted to take into account a wide range of scientific
perspectives, and interactions between regions and sectors.

very complex dynamic systems, determined by driving forces
such as demographic development, socio-economic

is highly uncertain. Scenarios are alternative images of how the
future might unfold and are an appropriate tool with which to
analyze how driving forces may influence future emission
outcomes and to assess the associated uncertainties. They assist
in climate change analysis, including climate modeling and the
assessment of impacts, adaptation, and mitigation. The
possibility that any single emissions path will occur as
described in scenarios is highly uncertain.

"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
developed long-term emission scenarios in 1990 and 1992.
These scenarios have been widely used in the analysis of
possible climate change, its impacts, and options to mitigate
climate change. In 1995, the IPCC 1992 scenarios were
evaluated, The evaluation recommended that significant
changes (since 1992) in the understanding of driving forces of
emissions and methodologies should be addressed. These
changes in understanding relate to, e.g., the carbon intensity of
energy supply, the income gap between developed and
developing countries, and to sulfur emissions. This led to a
decision by the IPCC Plenary in 1996 to develop a new set of
scenarios. The new set of scenarios is presented in this report.

"As required by the Terms of Reference, the scenarios in this
report do not include additional climate initiatives, which
means that no scenarios are included that explicitly assume
implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention
for Climate Change (UNFCCC) or the emissions targets of the
Kyoto Protocol. However, GHG emissions are directly affected
by non-climate change policies designed for a wide range of
other purposes. Furthermore government policies can, to
varying degrees, influence the GHG emission drivers such as
demographic change, social and economic development,
technological change, resource use, and pollution
management. This influence is broadly reflected in the
storylines and resultant scenarios.
"	Text
"For each storyline several different scenarios were developed
using different modeling approaches to examine the range of
outcomes arising from a range of models that use similar
assumptions about driving forces. Six models were used which
are representative of integrated assessment frameworks in the
literature. One advantage of a multi-model approach is that the
resultant 40 SRES scenarios together encompass the current
range of uncertainties of future GHG emissions arising from
different characteristics of these models, in addition to the
current knowledge of and uncertainties that arise from scenario
driving forces such as demographic, social and economic, and
broad technological developments that drive the models, as
described in the storylines. Thirteen of these 40 scenarios
explore variations in energy technology assumptions.

"By 2100 the world will have changed in ways that are difficult to imagine — as difficult as it would have been at the end of the
19th century to imagine the changes of the 100 years since. Each storyline assumes a distinctly different direction for future
developments, such that the four storylines differ in increasingly irreversible ways. Together they describe divergent futures that
encompass a significant portion of the underlying uncertainties in the main driving forces. They cover a wide range of key

underlying themes are convergence among regions, capacity building, and increased cultural and social interactions, with
a substantial reduction in regional differences in per capita income. The Al scenario family develops into three groups

Figure SPM-1: Schematic illustration of SRES scenarios. Four qualitative storylines yield four sets of scenarios called
“families”: Al, A2, B1, and B2. Altogether 40 SRES scenarios have been developed by six modeling teams. All are equally
valid with no assigned probabilities of occurrence. The set of scenarios consists of six scenario groups drawn from the four
families: one group each in A2, B1, B2, and three groups within the Al family, characterizing alternative developments of
energy technologies: A1FI (fossil fuel intensive), ALB (balanced), and AIT (predominantly non-fossil fuel). Within each
family and group of scenarios, some share “harmonized” assumptions on global population, gross world product, and final
energy. These are marked as “HS” for harmonized scenarios. “OS” denotes scenarios that explore uncertainties in driving
forces beyond those of the harmonized scenarios. The number of scenarios developed within each category is shown. For
each of the six scenario groups an illustrative scenario (which is always harmonized) is provided. Four illustrative marker
scenarios, one for each scenario family, were used in draft form in the 1998 SRES open process and are included in revised
form in this report. Two additional illustrative scenarios for the groups A1FI and AIT are also provided and complete a set
of six that illustrate all scenario groups. All are equally sound.

release draft scenarios to climate modelers for their input in

storylines. The choice of the markers was based on which of
the initial quantifications best reflected the storyline, and
features of specific models. Marker scenarios are no more or
less likely than any other scenarios, but are considered by the
SRES writing team as illustrative of a particular storyline.

"Within each scenario family two main types of scenarios were
developed ~ those with harmonized assumptions about global
population, economic growth, and final energy use and those
with alternative quantification of the storyline. Together, 26
scenarios were harmonized by adopting common assumptions
on global population and gross domestic product (GDP)
development, Thus, the harmonized scenarios in each family
are not independent of each other. The remaining 14 scenarios
adopted alternative interpretations of the four scenario
storylines to explore additional scenario uncertainties beyond
differences in methodologic approaches. They are also related
to each other within each family, even though they do not share
common assumptions about some of the driving forces.

"There are six scenario groups that should be considered
equally sound that span a wide range of uncertainty, as
required by the Terms of Reference. These encompass four
combinations of demographic change, social and economic
development, and broad technological developments,
corresponding to the four families (Al, A2, B1, B2), each with
an illustrative “marker” scenario. Two of the scenario groups of
the Al family (A1FI, A1T) explicitly explore alternative
energy technology developments, holding the other driving
forces constant, each with an illustrative scenario. Rapid
growth leads to high capital turnover rates, which means that
early small differences among scenarios can lead to a large
divergence by 2100. Therefore the Al family, which has the
highest rates of technological change and economic
development, was selected to show this effect,

"Recent global population projections are generally lower than
those in the I§92 scenarios. Three different population
trajectories that correspond to socio-economic developments in
the storylines were chosen from recently published projections.
The Al and BI scenario families are based on the low
International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (TASA)
1996 projection. They share the lowest trajectory, increasing to
8.7 billion by 2050 and declining toward 7 billion by 2100,
which combines low fertility with low mortality. The B2
scenario family is based on the long-term UN Medium 1998
population projection of 10.4 billion by 2100. The A2 scenario
family is based on a high population growth scenario of 15
billion by 2100 that assumes a significant decline in fertility for
most regions and stabilization at above replacement levels. It
falls below the long-term 1998 UN High projection of 18
billion.
"	Text
"The A2 storyline and scenario family describes a very heterogeneous world. The underlying theme is self-reliance and
preservation of local identities. Fertility patterns across regions converge very slowly, which results in continuously
increasing global population. Economic development is primarily regionally oriented and per capita economic growth
and technological change are more fragmented and slower than in other storylines.

The BI storyline and scenario family describes a convergent world with the same global population that peaks in mid-
century and declines thereafter, as in the Al storyline, but with rapid changes in economic structures toward a service
and information economy, with reductions in material intensity, and the introduction of clean and resource-efficient
technologies. The emphasis is on global solutions to economic, social, and environmental sustainability, including
improved equity, but without additional climate initiatives.

The B2 storyline and scenario family describes a world in which the emphasis is on local solutions to economic, social,
and environmental sustainability. It is a world with continuously increasing global population at a rate lower than A2,
intermediate levels of economic development, and less rapid and more diverse technological change than in the B1 and
Al storylines. While the scenario is also oriented toward environmental protection and social equity, it focuses on local
and regional levels.

"The SRES scenarios cover a wider range of energy structures

fossil resources and technological change. The scenarios cover
virtually all the possible directions of change, from high shares

"All the above driving forces not only influence CO, emissions,
but also the emissions of other GHGs. The relationships
between the driving forces and non-CO, GHG emissions are
generally more complex and less studied, and the models used
for the scenarios less sophisticated. Hence, the uncertainties in
the SRES emissions for non-CO, greenhouse gases are
generally greater than those for energy CO,°.
"	Text
"Technology is at least as important a driving force as
demographic change and economic development. These
driving forces are related. Within the Al scenario family,
scenarios with common demographic and socio-economic
driving forces but different assumptions about technology and
resource dynamics illustrate the possibility of very divergent
paths for developments in the energy system and land-use
patterns.

"In most scenarios, global forest area continues to decrease for
some decades, primarily because of increasing population and
income growth. This current trend is eventually reversed in most
scenarios with the greatest eventual increase in forest area by
2100 in the BI and B2 scenario families, as compared to 1990.
Associated changes in agricultural land use are driven principally
by changing food demands caused by demographic and dietary
shifts. Numerous other social, economic, institutional, and
technological factors also affect the relative shares of agricultural
lands, forests, and other types of land use. Different analytic
methods lead to very different results, indicating that future land
use change in the scenarios is very model specific.

Figure SPM-4: Total global cumulative CO, emissions (GtC) from 1990 to 2100 (SPM-4a) and histogram of their distribution
by scenario groups (SPM-4b). No probability of occurrence should be inferred from the distribution of SRES scenarios or those
in the literature. Both figures show the ranges of cumulative emissions for the 40 SRES scenarios. Scenarios are also grouped
into four cumulative emissions categories: low, medium-low, medium-high, and high emissions. Each category contains one
illustrative marker scenario plus alternatives that lead to comparable cumulative emissions, although often through different
driving forces, This categorization can guide comparisons using either scenarios with different driving forces yet similar
emissions, or scenarios with similar driving forces but different emissions. The curnulative emissions of the [S92 scenarios are
also shown.

"Methane and nitrous oxide emissions from land use are limited
in Al and BI families by slower population growth followed by
a decline, and increased agricultural productivity. After the
initial increases, emissions related to land use peak and
decline. In the B2 family, emissions continue to grow, albeit
very slowly. In the A2 family, both high population growth and
less rapid increases in agricultural productivity result in a
continuous rapid growth in those emissions related to land use.
"	Text
"Total anthropogenic methane (CH,) and nitrous oxide (N,O)
emissions span a wide range by the end of the 21° century (see
Figures SPM-5 and SPM-6 derived from Figures 5.5 and 5.7).
Emissions of these gases in a number of scenarios begin to
decline by 2050. The range of emissions is wider than in the
1892 scenarios due to the multimodel approach, which leads to
a better treatment of uncertainties and to a wide range of
driving forces. These totals include emissions from land use,
energy systems, industry, and waste management.
"	Text
"The range of emissions of HFCs in the SRES scenario is
generally lower than in earlier IPCC scenarios. Because of new
insights about the availability of alternatives to HFCs as
replacements for substances controlled by the Montreal Protocol,
initially HFC emissions are generally lower than in previous
IPCC scenarios. In the A2 and B2 scenario families HFC
emissions increase rapidly in the second half of the this century,
while in the A2 and B2 scenario families the growth of emissions
is significantly slowed down or reversed in that period.
"	Text
"Some SRES scenarios show trend reversals, turning points (i.e.,
initial emission increases followed by decreases), and
crossovers (i.€., initially emissions are higher in one scenario,
but later emissions are higher in another scenario). Emission
trend reversals (see Figures SPM-2 and SPM-3) depart from
historical emission increases. In most of these cases, the
upward emissions trend due to income growth is more than
compensated by productivity improvements combined with a
slowly growing or declining population.
"	Text
"In many SRES scenarios CO, emissions from loss of forest
cover peak after several decades and then gradually decline’
(Figure SPM-1b). This pattern is consistent with scenarios in
the literature and can be associated with slowing population
growth, followed by a decline in some scenarios, increasing
agricultural productivity, and increasing scarcity of forest land.
These factors allow for a reversal of the current trend of loss of
forest cover in many cases. Emissions decline fastest in the B1
family. Only in the A2 family do net anthropogenic CO,
emissions from land use change? remain positive through 2100.
As was the case for energy-related emissions, CO, emissions
related to land-use change in the Al family cover the widest
range. The diversity across these scenarios is amplified through
the high economic growth, increasing the range of alternatives,
and through the different modeling approaches and their
treatment of technology.
"	Text
"The SRES scenarios cover most of the range of carbon dioxide
(CO,; see Figures SPM-2a and SPM-2b), other GHGs, and
sulfur emissions found in the recent literature and SRES
scenario database. Their spread is similar to that of the [S92
scenarios for CO, emissions from energy and industry as well
as total emissions but represents a much wider range for land-
use change. The six scenario groups cover wide and
overlapping emission ranges. The range of GHG emissions in
the scenarios widens over time to capture the long-term
uncertainties reflected in the literature for many of the driving
forces, and after 2050 widens significantly as a result of
different socio-economic developments. Table SPM-2b
summarizes the emissions across the scenarios in 2020, 2050,
and 2100. Figure SPM-3 shows in greater detail the ranges of
total CO, emissions for the six scenario groups of scenarios
that constitute the four families (the three scenario families A2,

scenarios provides a useful context for understanding the
relative position of a scenario but does not represent the
likelihood of its occurrence.

"It is recommended that a range of SRES scenarios with a
variety of assumptions regarding driving forces be used in any
analysis. Thus more than one family should be used in most
analyses. The six scenario groups — the three scenario families
A2, B1, and B2, plus three groups within the Al scenario
family, A1B, A1FI, and ALT — and four cumulative emissions
categories were developed as the smallest subsets of SRES
scenarios that capture the range of uncertainties associated
with driving forces and emissions.
"	Text
"Convergence of regional per capita incomes can lead to either
high or low GHG emissions. Tables SPM-1a and SPM-1b
indicate that there are scenarios with high per capita incomes
in all regions that lead to high CO, emissions (e.g., in the high-
growth, fossil fuel intensive scenario group A1FI). They also
indicate that there are scenarios with high per capita incomes
that lead to low emissions (e.g., the AIT scenario group or the
BI scenario family). This suggests that in some cases other
driving forces may have a greater influence on GHG emissions
than income growth.
"	Text
"Similar future GHG emissions can result from very different
socio-economic developments, and similar developments of
driving forces can result in different future emissions.
Uncertainties in the future developments of key emission
driving forces create large uncertainties in future emissions,
even within the same socio-economic development paths.
Therefore, emissions from each scenario family overlap
substantially with emissions from other scenario families. The
overlap implies that a given level of future emissions can arise
from very different combinations of driving forces. Figures
SPM-1, SPM-2, and SPM-3 show this for CO,.
"	Text
"While recognizing the inherent uncertainties in long-term
projections’, the SRES scenarios may provide policymakers
with a long-term context for near-term analysis. The modeling
tools that have been used to develop these scenarios that focus
on the century time scale are less suitable for analysis of near
term (a decade or less) developments. When analyzing
mitigation and adaptation options, the user should be aware
that although no additional climate initiatives are included in
the SRES scenarios, various changes have been assumed to
occur that would require other interventions, such as those
leading to reductions in sulfur emissions and significant
penetration of new energy technologies.
"	Text
"The important uncertainties ranging from driving forces to
emissions may be different in different applications — for
example climate modeling; assessment of impacts,
vulnerability, mitigation, and adaptation options; and policy
analysis. Climate modelers may want to cover the range
reflected by the cumulative emissions categories. To assess the
robustness of options in terms of impacts, vulnerability, and
adaptation may require scenarios with similar emissions but
different socio-economic characteristics, as reflected by the six
scenario groups. For mitigation analysis, variation in both
emissions and socio-economic characteristics may be
necessary. For analysis at the national or regional scale, the
most appropriate scenarios may be those that best reflect
specific circumstances and perspectives.

"TECHNICAL SUMMARY
"	Title
"Emissions Scenarios and Their Purposes
"	Title
"? Metric tons are used throughout this report. Unless otherwise
specified, monetary units are 1990 US dollars (see Chapter 4).
"	Text
"Emissions scenarios are a central component of any assessment
of climate change. GHG and SO, emissions are the basic input
"	Text
"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
decided at its September 1996 plenary session in Mexico City
to develop a new set of emissions scenarios (see Appendix I for
the Terms of Reference). This Special Report on Emission
Scenarios (SRES) describes the new scenarios and how they
were developed.
"	Text
"Scenarios are images of the future, or alternative futures. They
are neither predictions nor forecasts. Rather, each scenario is
one alternative image of how the future might unfold (see
Chapters 1 and 4 for more detail). As such they enhance our
understanding of how systems behave, evolve and interact.
They are useful tools for scientific assessments, learning about
complex systems behavior and for policymaking and assist in
climate change analysis, including climate modeling and the
assessment of impacts, adaptation and mitigation,
"	Text
"Future emissions and the evolution of their underlying driving
forces are highly uncertain, as reflected in the very wide range
of future emissions paths in the literature that is also captured
by the SRES scenarios. The use of scenarios in this report
addresses the uncertainties related to known factors.
Uncertainties related to unknown factors can of course never be
persuasively captured by any approach. As the prediction of
future anthropogenic GHG emissions is impossible, alternative
GHG emissions scenarios become a major tool for analyzing
potential long-range developments of the socio-economic
system and corresponding emission sources.

"The SRES writing team formulated a set of emissions
scenarios. These scenarios cover a wide range of the main
driving forces of future emissions, from demographic to
technological and economic developments. The scenarios
encompass different future developments that might influence
greenhouse gas (GHG) sources and sinks, such as alternative
structures of energy systems and land-use changes. As required
by the Terms of Reference however, none of the scenarios in
the set includes any future policies that explicitly address
additional climate change initiatives’, although GHG
emissions are directly affected by non-climate change policies
designed for a wide range of other purpose.

"Future levels of global GHG emissions are a product of very
complex, ill-understood dynamic systems, driven by forces
such as population growth, socio-economic development, and
technological progress among others, thus making long-term
predictions about emissions virtually impossible. However,
near-term policies may have profound long-term climate
impacts. Consequently, policy makers need a summary of what
is understood about possible future GHG emissions, and given
the uncertainties in both emissions models and our
understanding of key driving forces, scenarios are an
appropriate tool for summarizing both current understanding
and current uncertainties.

"The set of SRES emissions scenarios is based on an extensive
assessment of the literature, six alternative modeling
approaches, and an “open process” that solicited wide
participation and feedback from many groups and individuals.
The set of scenarios includes anthropogenic emissions of all
relevant GHG species, sulfur dioxide (SO,), carbon monoxide
(CO), nitrogen oxides (NO,), and non-methane volatile organic
compounds (NMVOCs), see Table 1-1 in Chapter 1. It covers
most of the range of GHG emissions compared with the
published scenario literature. For example, emissions of carbon
dioxide (CO,) in 2100 range from more than 40 to less than 6
giga (or billion) tons? of elemental carbon (GtC), that is, from
almost a sevenfold increase to roughly the same emissions

relationships and driving forces of change, which are derived

quantitative and more descriptive, and in a few cases they do
not involve any formal analysis and are expressed in qualitative

quantitative components; they have a narrative part called
“storylines” and a number of corresponding quantitative

climate change assessments. In 1995 the IPCC formally
evaluated the 1992 scenarios and found that they were
innovative at the time of their publication, path-breaking in
their coverage of the full range of GHG emissions and useful
for the purpose of driving atmospheric and climate models

scenario, Indeed, the conclusion was that there was no
objective basis on which to assign likelihood to any of the
scenarios. Furthermore, the IS92a scenario was shown to be
“central” for only a few of its salient characteristics such as
global population growth, global economic development and
global CO, emissions. In other ways, [S92a was found not to
be central with respect to the published literature, particularly
in some of its regional assumptions and emissions. The same is

"However, developing scenarios for a period of one hundred
years is a relatively new field. This is not only because of large
scientific uncertainties and data inadequacies. For example,
within the 21"" century technological discontinuities should be
expected, and possibly major shifts in societal values and in the
balance of geopolitical power. The study of past trends over
such long periods is hampered by the fact that most databases
are incomplete if we go back much further than 50 years. Given
these gaps in our data, methods, and understanding, scenarios
are the best way to integrate demographic, economic, societal,
and technological knowledge with our understanding of
ecological systems to evaluate sources and sinks of GHG
emissions. Scenarios as an integration tool in the assessment of
climate change allow a role for intuition, analysis, and
synthesis, and thus we turn to scenarios in this report to take
advantage of those features to aid the assessment of future
climate change, impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and
mitigation. Since the scenarios focus on the century time scale,
tools have been used that have been developed for this purpose.
These tools are less suitable for analysis of near-term
developments and this report does not intend to provide

at the 5 Session of WGI in Katmandu, it was decided to

To facilitate the process of identifying and describing
alternative future developments, each scenario family includes
a coherent narrative part called a “storyline,” and a number of
alternative interpretations and quantifications of each storyline
developed by six different modeling approaches. All the
interpretations and quantifications of one storyline together are
called a scenario family (see also Box 1-1 in Chapter 1 on

one of these scenario families. Storylines were formulated by
the writing team in a process which identified driving forces,
key uncertainties, possible scenario families, and their logic.
Within each family different scenarios explore variations of
global and regional developments and their implications for
GHG and sulfur emissions. Each of these scenarios is

developments, such that the four storylines differ in increasingly irreversible ways. Together they describe divergent futures that
encompass a significant portion of the underlying uncertainties in the main driving forces. They cover a wide range of key

transitions in generally different directions. Although they do
not include additional climate initiatives, none of them are
policy free. As time progresses, the storylines diverge from
each other in many of their characteristic features. In this way
they allow us to span the relevant range of GHG emissions and
different combinations of their main sources.

noted that future energy systems variations could be applied to
the other storylines, but they may evolve differently from those

of its “high growth with high technology” nature, where
differences in alternative technology developments translate
into large differences in future GHG emission levels.
Altogether the 40 SRES scenarios fall into seven groups: the
three scenario families, A2, Bl, and B2, plus four groups
within the Al scenario. In the SPM, two of these groups, the
coal and gas and oil intensive groups, were merged into one

development compared to “harmonized” scenarios and also
stem from the differences in the underlying modeling

represents a modeler’s choice or harmonized assumptions —
was treated as being more or less “probable” than the others
belonging to the same family. Initially, for each storyline, one
modeling group was given principal responsibility, and the
quantification produced by that group is referred to as the
“marker” scenario for that storyline. The four preliminary
marker scenarios were used in 1998 to solicit comments during
the “open process” and as input for climate modelers in
accordance with a decision of the IPCC Bureau in 1998, The
four marker scenarios were posted on the SRES web site
(www.sres.ciesin) in June 1998 and were subsequently revised
to account for comments and suggestions received through this
open scenario review process that lasted until January 1999. In
addition to many revisions, the marker scenarios were also
harmonized along with the other 26 scenarios that adopted
common assumptions for the main driving forces within the

it proved impossible to develop scenarios in which all relevant
characteristics match mean or median values. Thus, marker
scenarios are no more or less likely than any other scenarios, but
are those scenarios considered by the SRES writing team as
illustrative of a particular storyline. These scenarios have
received the closest scrutiny of the entire writing team and via
the SRES open process compared to other scenario
quantifications. The marker scenarios are also those SRES
scenarios that have been most intensively tested in terms of
reproducibility. As a rule, different modeling teams have
attempted to replicate the model quantification of marker
scenarios. Available time and resources have not allowed a
similar exercise to be conducted for all SRES scenarios,
although some effort was devoted to reproduce the four scenario

"Additional scenarios using the same harmonized assumptions
as the marker scenarios developed by different modeling teams
and other scenarios that give alternative quantitative
interpretations of the four storylines constitute the final set of
40 SRES scenarios. This also means that the 40 scenarios are
not independent of each other as they are all based on four
storylines and subdivided into seven scenario groups (after
merging two groups, six in the SPM) that share many common
assumptions. In addition to many revisions of the marker and
other harmonized scenarios, other alternative scenarios were
formulated by the six modeling teams within each of the four
scenario families. The result is a more complete, refined set of
40 emissions scenarios that reflects the broad spectrum of
modeling approaches and regional perspectives, However,
differences in modeling approaches have meant that not all of
the scenarios provide estimates for all the direct and indirect
GHG emissions for all the sources and sectors. In addition to
the marker scenarios, two scenarios were also selected in the
SPM to illustrate the alternative energy systems developments
in the Al family. Hence, this report has an illustrative scenario
for each of the six scenario groups in the SPM. The four SRES
marker scenarios and the two illustrative scenarios (selected in
the SPM) cover all the relevant gas species and emission
categories comprehensively and thus constitute the smallest set
of independent and fully documented SRES scenarios.

"The lowest population trajectory is assumed for the Al and B1
scenario families and is based on the low population projection
in Lutz (1996), which combines low fertility with low
mortality and central migration rate assumptions. After
peaking at 8.7 billion in the middle of the 21“ century, world
population declines to 7.1 billion by the year 2100. As
discussed in Chapters 3 and 4, this population development is
somewhat higher than the previous low population used in the
IS92 scenarios. The B2 scenario family is based on the UN
median 1998 population projection (UN, 1998). The global
population increases to about 9.4 billion people by 2050 and to
about 10.4 billion by 2100. This population scenario is
characteristic of recent median global population projections,
which describe a continuation of historical trends toward a
completion of the demographic transition that would lead to a
constant global population, and is consistent with recent faster
fertility declines in the world together with declining mortality
rates. Hence, the population is somewhat lower than previous
UN median projections, as used in the IS92 scenarios. This
median scenario projects very low population growth in
today’s industrialized countries, with stabilization of growth in
Asia in the second half of the 21% century and in the rest of the
world towards the end of the 21% century. The A2 scenario

"possibilities for development “catch-up” and for narrowing
per capita income gaps in particular explain the wide range in
projected future gross world product levels. Given a
qualitatively negative relationship between population growth

uncertainties in future population growth rates tend to narrow
the range of associated gross world product projections, High
population growth would, ceteris paribus, lower per capita
income growth, whereas low population growth would tend to
increase it. This relationship is evident in empiric data — high
per capita income countries are generally also those that have
completed their demographic transition. The affluent live long
and generally have few children. (Exceptions are some
countries with small populations, high birth rates, and
significant income from commodity exports.) This
relationship between affluence and longevity again identifies
development as one of the most important indicators of human
well being. Yet even assuming this relationship holds for an
extended time into the future, its quantification is subject to
considerable theoretic and empiric uncertainties (Alcamo et

"Different assumptions on these processes translate into
alternative scenarios of future land-use changes and GHG
emissions, most notably CO,, methane (CH,), and nitrous
oxide (N,O). A distinguishing characteristic of several models
(e.g., AIM, IMAGE, MARIA, and MiniCAM) used in SRES is
the explicit modeling of land-use changes caused by expanding
biomass uses and hence exploration of possible land-use
conflicts between energy and agricultural sectors. The
corresponding scenarios of land-use changes are illustrated in
Figure TS-5 for all SRES scenarios. In some contrast to the
structural changes in energy systems shown in Figure TS-4,
different land-use scenarios in Figure TS-5 appear to be rather
model specific, following the general trends as indicated by the
respective marker scenario developed with a particular model.
"	Text
"The main driving forces for land-use changes are related to
increasing demands for food because of a growing population
and changing diets, In addition, numerous other social,
economic, and institutional factors govern land-use changes
such as deforestation, expansion of cropland areas, or their
reconversion back to forest cover (see Chapter 3), Global food
production can be increased, either through intensification (by
multi-cropping, raising cropping intensity, applying fertilizers,
new seeds, improved farming technology) or through land
expansion (cultivating land, converting forests). Especially in
developing countries, there are many examples of the potential
to intensify food production in a more or less ecological way
(e.g. multi-cropping; agroforestry) that may not lead to higher
GHG emissions.

"Figure TS-6 illustrates the CO, emissions across the SRES
scenarios in relation to each of the three main scenario driving
forces — global population, gross world product and primary
energy requirements. The general tendencies across the driving
forces are consistent with the underlying literature. All else
being equal, the higher future global populations, higher gross
world product, or higher primary energy requirements would
be associated with higher emissions. However, it is important
to note that the range of emissions is large across the whole
range of driving forces considered in SRES, indicating the
magnitude of the uncertainty associated with emission
scenarios. For instance, emissions can range widely for any
given level of future population (e.g. between 5 to 20 GiC in
case of a low population scenario of seven billion by 2100).
Conversely, emissions in the range of 20 GtC are possible with
global population levels ranging from seven to 15 billion by
2100. While the SRES scenarios do not map all possibilities,
they do indicate general tendencies, with an uncertainty range
consistent with the underlying literature. This emphasizes an
important SRES conclusion: alternative combinations of main
scenario driving forces can lead to similar levels of GHGs
emissions by the end of the 21° century. Alternatively, similar
future worlds with respect to socio-economic developments
can result in wide differences in future GHGs emissions,
primarily as a result of alternative technological developments.
This suggests that technology is at least as important a driving
force of future GHG emissions as population and economic
development across the set of 40 SRES scenarios.

"Another interpretation is that a given combination of the main
driving forces, such as the population and economic growth, is
not sufficient to determine the future emissions paths. Different
modeling approaches and different specifications of other
scenario assumptions overshadow the influence of the main
driving forces. A particular combination of driving forces, such
as specified in the Al scenario family, is associated with a
whole range of possible emission paths from energy and
industry. The nature of climate change impacts and adaptation
and mitigation strategies would be fundamentally different
depending on whether emissions are high or low, given a
particular combination of scenario driving forces. Thus, the
implication is that the whole range needs to be considered in
the assessments of climate change, from high emissions and
driving forces to low ones.

themselves cover a large portion of the overall scenario
distribution. Together, they cover much of the range of future
emissions, both with respect to the scenarios in the literature
and all SRES scenarios, Adding all other scenarios increases
the covered range. For example, the SRES scenarios span
jointly from the 95"""" percentile to just above the 5"" percentile
of the distribution of energy and industry emissions scenarios
from the literature. This illustrates again that they only exclude
the most extreme emissions scenarios found in the literature
that are situated out in the tails of the distribution. What is
perhaps more important is that each of the four scenario
families covers a substantial part of this distribution. This leads
to a substantial overlap in the emissions ranges of the four
scenario families. In other words, a similar quantification of
driving forces can lead to a wide range of future emissions and
a given level of future emissions can result from different
combinations of driving forces. This result is of fundamental
importance for the assessments of climate change impacts and
possible mitigation and adaptation strategies. Thus, it warrants
some further discussion.

the 10 percentile. The Al scenario family includes four
groups of scenarios that explore different structures of future
energy systems, from carbon-intensive development paths to
high rates of decarbonization. Two of the fossil-intensive
groups were merged into one group, as in SPM, resulting in
three Al groups. All Al groups otherwise share the same
assumptions about the main driving forces (see Chapter 6 and
for further detail Chapters 4 and 5). This indicates that different
structures of the energy system can lead to basically the same
variation in future emissions as generated by different
combinations of the other main driving forces — population,
economic activities, and energy consumption levels. The
implication is that decarbonization of energy systems — the
shift from carbon-intensive to less carbon-intensive and
carbon-free sources of energy — is of similar importance in
determining the future emissions paths as other driving forces.
Sustained decarbonization requires the development and
successful diffusion of new technologies. Thus investments in
new technologies during the coming decades might have the
same order of influence on future emissions as population
growth, economic development, and levels of energy
consumption taken together.

additional radiative forcing of around 2.5 W/m? on a global and

worlds with fundamentally different characteristic features,

similar CO, emissions in 2100. In contrast, scenarios that are
in the same category of cumulative emissions can have
fundamentally different driving forces and different CO,

developing different emission trajectories consistent with

assumptions on diets and improvements in agricultural
practices. Other things being equal, N,O emissions are
generally highest in the high population scenario family A2.
Importantly, as the largest anthropogenic source of N,O
(cultivated soils) is already very uncertain in the base year, all
future emission trajectories are affected by large uncertainties,
especially if calculated with different models as is the case in
this SRES report. Therefore, the writing team recommends
further research into the sources and modeling of long-term
N,O emissions, Uncertainty ranges are correspondingly large,
and are sometimes asymmetric. For example, while the range in
2100 reported in all Al scenarios is between 5 and 10 MtN (7
MIN in the A1B marker), the A2 marker reports 17 MtN in
2100. Other A2 scenarios report emissions that fall within the
range reported for Al (from 8 to 19 MtN in 2100). Thus,
different model representations of processes that lead to N,O
emissions and uncertainties in source strength can outweigh
easily any underlying differences between individual scenarios
in terms of population growth, economic development, etc.
Different assumptions with respect to future crop productivity,
agricultural practices, and associated emission factors,
especially in the very populous regions of the world, explain the
very different global emission levels even for otherwise shared
main scenario drivers. Hence, the SRES scenarios extend the
uncertainty range of future emissions significantly toward
higher emissions (4.8 to 20.2 MtN by 2100 in SRES compared
to 5.4 to 10.8 MtN in the 1892 scenarios. (Note that natural
sources are excluded in this comparison.)

"The resultant CH, emission trajectories for the four SRES
scenario families portray complex patterns (as displayed in
Figure 5-5 in Chapter 5). For example, the emissions in A2 and
B2 marker scenarios increase throughout the whole time
horizon to the year 2100. Increases are most pronounced in the
high population A2 scenarios where emissions rise to between
549 and 1069 (A2 marker: 900) MtCH, by 2100, compared to
310 MtCH, in 1990. The emissions range by 2100 in the B2
scenarios is between 465 and 613 (B2 marker: 600) MtCH,. In
the A1B and B1 marker scenarios, the CH, emissions level off
and subsequently decline sooner or later in the 21S century.
This phenomenon is most pronounced in the A1B marker, in
which the fastest growth in the first few decades is followed by
the steepest decline; the 2100 level ends up slightly below the
current emission of 310 MtCH,. The range of emissions in
Table TS-4 indicates that alternative developments in energy
technologies and resources could yield a higher range in CH,
emissions compared to the “balanced” technology AIB
scenario group that includes the A1B marker scenario
discussed above. In the fossil-intensive A1FI group (combined
from A1C and AIG groups, as in the SPM), CH, emissions
could reach some 735 MtCH, by 2100, whereas in the post-
fossil AIT scenario group emissions are correspondingly lower
(some 300 MtCH, by 2100). Interestingly, the Al scenarios
generally have comparatively low CH, emissions from non-
energy sources because of a combination of low population
growth and rapid advances in agricultural productivity. Hence
the SRES scenarios extend the uncertainty range of the [S92
scenario series somewhat toward lower emissions. However,
both scenario sets indicate an upper bound of emissions of
some 1000 MtCH, by 2100.

of the latest information from the industry, is that relatively few
Montreal gases wiil be replaced fully by HFCs. Current
indications are that substitution rates of CFCs by HFCs will be
less than 50% (McCulloch and Midgley, 1998). In Fenhann
(2000) a further technological development is assumed that
would result in about 25% of the CFCs ultimately being
substituted by HFCs (see Table 5-9 in Chapter 5). This low
percentage not only reflects the introduction of non-HFC
substitutes, but also the notion that smaller amounts of
halocarbons will be used in many applications when changing
to HFCs (efficiency gains with technological change). A
general assumption is that the present trend, not to substitute
with high GWP substances (including PFCs and SF), will
continue. As a result of this assumption, the emissions reported
here may be underestimates. This substitution approach is used
in all four scenarios, and the technological options adopted are
those known at present. Further substitution away from HFCs
is assumed to require a climate policy and is therefore not
considered in SRES scenarios. The range of emissions of HFCs
in the SRES scenario is initially generally lower than in earlier
IPCC scenarios because of new insights about the availability
of alternatives to HFCs as replacements for substances
controlled by the Montreal Protocol. In two of the four
scenarios in the report, HFC emissions increase rapidly in the
second half of the next century, while in two others the growth
of emissions is significantly slowed down or reversed in that
period.

"A detailed review of long-term global and regional sulfur
emission scenarios is given in Griibler (1998) and summarized
in Chapter 3. The most important new finding from the scenario
literature is recognition of the significant adverse impacts of
sulfur emissions on human health, food production, and
ecosystems. As a result, scenarios published since 1995
generally assume various degrees of sulfur controls to be
implemented in the future, and thus have projections
substantially lower than previous ones, including the IS92
scenario series. Of these, only the two low-demand scenarios
1892c and 1S92d fall within the range of more recent long-term
sulfur emission scenarios. A related reason for lower sulfur
emission projections is the recent tightening of sulfur-control
policies in the OECD countries, such as the Amendments of the
Clean Air Act in the USA and the implementation of the Second
European Sulfur Protocol. Such legislative changes were not
reflected in previous long-term emission scenarios, as noted in
Alcamo et al. (1995) and Houghton eg al. (1995). Similar sulfur
control initiatives due to local air quality concerns are
beginning to impact sulfur emissions also in a number of
developing countries in Asia and Latin America (see IEA, 1999;
La Rovere and Americano, 1998; Streets and Waldhoff, 2000;
for a more detailed discussion see Chapter 3). As a result, even
the highest range of recent sulfur-control scenarios is
significantly below that of comparable, high-demand IS92
scenarios (IS92a, IS92b, IS92e, and IS92f). The scenarios with
the lowest ranges project stringent sulfur-control levels that lead
to a substantial decline in long-term emissions and a return to
emission levels that prevailed at the beginnings of the 20""
century. The SRES scenario set brackets global anthropogenic
sulfur emissions of between 27 and 169 MtS by 2050 and
between 11 and 93 MtS by 2100 (see Table TS-4). In contrast,
the range of the IS92 scenarios (Pepper et al., 1992) is
substantially higher starting at 80 MtS and extending all the
way to 200 MIS by 2050 and from 55 to 230 MtS by 2100.

"Emissions in the OECD countries continue their recent
declining trend (reflecting the tightening of control measures).
Emissions outside the OECD rise initially, most notably in
Asia, which compensates for the declining OECD emissions.
Over the long term, however, sulfur emissions decline
throughout the world, but the timing and magnitude vary
across the scenarios. It should be noted that SRES scenarios
assume sulfur controls only and do not assume any additional
climate policy measures. Nevertheless, one important
implication of this varying pattern of sulfur emissions is that
the historically important, but uncertain, negative radiative
forcing of sulfate aerosols may decline in the very long run.
This view is also confirmed by the model calculations reported
in Subak et al. (1997) and Nakicenovié er al. (1998) based on
recent long-term GHG and sulfur emission scenarios.

"The same caveats as stated above for NO, and NMVOC
emissions also apply to CO emissions — the number of models
that represent all the emission source categories is limited and
modeling and data uncertainties, such as emission factors, are
considerable. As a result, CO emission estimates across
scenarios are highly model specific and future emission levels
overlap considerably between the four SRES scenario families

"(see Table TS-4), Generally, emissions are highest in the high
growth fossil fuel intensive scenarios within the Al scenario
family. Lowest emission levels are generally associated with
the B1 and B2 scenario families. By 2100, emissions range
between 363 and 3766 Mt CO, a considerably larger
uncertainty range, particularly toward higher emissions, than in
1892, for which the 2100 emission range was between 450 and
929 Mt CO (see Table TS-4).

"NMVOCs arise from fossil fuel combustion (as with NO,,
wide ranges of emission factors are typical for internal
combustion engines), and also from industrial processes, fuel
storage (fugitive emissions), use of solvents (e.g., in paint and
cleaners), and a variety of other activities. In this report
NMVOCs are discussed as one group. As for NO, emissions,
not all models include the NMVOCs emissions category or all
of its sources.
"	Text
"A relatively robust trend across all 40 scenarios (see Chapter 5)
is a gradual increase in NMVOC emissions up to about 2050,
with a range between 190 and 260 Mt. Beyond 2050,
uncertainties increase with respect to both emission levels and
trends. By 2100, the range is between 58 and 552 Mt, which
extends the [S92 scenario range of 136 to 403 Mt by 2100
toward both higher and lower emissions (see Table TS-4). As
for NO, emissions, the upper bounds of NMVOC emissions
are formed by the fossil fuel intensive scenarios within the Al
scenario family, and the lower bounds by the scenarios within
the B1 scenario family. Characteristic ranges are between 60
and 90 Mt NMVOC by 2100 in the low emissions cluster and
between 370 and 550 Mt NMVOC in the high emissions
cluster. All other scenario families and individual scenarios fall
between these two emissions clusters; the B2 marker scenario
(B2-MESSAGE) closely tracks the median of global NUVOC
emissions from all the SRES scenarios (see Chapter 5).

"in the highest emission scenarios (the fossil fuel intensive
scenarios within the Al scenario family and the high
population, coal intensive A2 scenario family) do emissions
tise continuously throughout the 21° century. In the AIB
(“balanced”) scenario group and in the B2 scenario family,
NO, emission levels rise less. NO, emissions tend to increase
up to 2050 and stabilize thereafter, the result of a gradual
substitution of fossil fuels by alternatives as well as of the
increasing diffusion of NO, control technologies. Low
emission futures are described by various B1 family scenarios,
as well as in the A1T scenario group, that describe futures in
which NO, emissions are controlled because of either local air
quality concerns or rapid technological change away from
conventional fossil technologies. Overall, the SRES scenarios
describe a similar upper range of NO, emissions as the
previous IS92 scenarios (151 MtN versus 134 MUN,
respectively, by 2100), but extend the IS92 uncertainty range
toward lower emission levels (16 versus 54 MtN by 2100 in the
SRES and IS92 scenarios, respectively).

"Alternative combinations of driving forces can lead. to
similar levels and structure of energy and land-use
patterns, as illustrated by different scenarios and
groups. Hence, even for a given scenario outcome (e.g.,
in terms of GHG emissions) there are alternative
combinations of driving forces and pathways that could
lead to that outcome. For instance, significant global
changes could result from a scenario of high population
growth, even if per capita incomes rise only modestly,
as well as from a scenario in which a rapid
demographic transition (to low population levels)
coincides with high rates of income growth and
affluence.

Important possibilities for further bifurcations in future
development trends exist within one scenario family,
even when particular values are adopted for the
important scenario driving force variables to illustrate a
particular development path, The technology scenario
groups in the Al family illustrate such alternative
development paths with similar quantifications of the
main driving forces.

Emissions profiles are dynamic across the range of
SRES scenarios. They portray trend reversals and
indicate possible emissions crossover among different
scenarios. They do not represent mere extensions of
continuous increase of GHGs and SO, emissions into
the future. This more complex pattern of future
emissions across the range of SRES scenarios, time
periods, world regions, and sectors reflects recent

"does not exist alone. And even for each alternative
development path described by any given scenario, there
are numerous combinations of driving forces and
numeric values that can be consistent with a particular
scenario description. The numeric precision of any model
result should not distract from the basic fact that
uncertainty abounds. However, the multi-model approach
increases the value of the SRES scenario set, since
uncertainties in the choice of model input assumptions
can be separated more explicitly from the specific model
behavior and related modeling uncertainties.

Any scenario has subjective elements and is open to
various interpretations, While the writing team as a
whole has no preference for any of the scenarios, and has
no judgment as to the probability or desirability of
different scenarios, the open process and initial reactions
to draft versions of this report show that individuals and
interest groups do have such judgments. The writing
team hopes that this will stimulate an open discussion in

"The four scenario families each have a narrative storyline and consist of 40 scenarios developed by six modeling groups.
The 40 scenarios cover the full range of GHGs and SO, emissions consistent with the underlying range of driving forces
from scenario literature.

The 40 SRES scenarios fall into various groups — the three scenario families A2, B1, and B2, plus different groups within
the Al scenario family. The Al groups are distinguished by their technological emphasis — on coal (A1C), oil and gas
(AIG), non-fossil energy sources (A1T), or a balance across all sources (A1B). In the SPM, the AIC and A1G scenario
groups are combined into one fossil intensive group A1FI. All scenario groups are equally sound.

The scenarios are also grouped into four categories of cumulative CO, emissions, which indicate that scenarios with
different driving forces can lead to similar cumulative emissions and those with similar driving forces can branch out into
different categories of cumulative emissions.

Four from 40 scenarios are designated as marker scenarios that are characteristic of the four scenarios families. Together
with the two additional illustrative scenarios selected from the scenario groups in the Al family, they capture most of the
emissions and driving forces spanned by the full set of the scenarios.

There is no single central or “best guess” scenario, and probabilities or likelihood are not assigned to individual scenarios.
Instead, the writing team recommends that the smallest set of scenarios used should include the four designated marker
scenarios and the two additional illustrative scenarios selected from the scenario groups in the Al family.

Distinction between scenarios that envisage stringent environmental policies and those that include direct climate policies
was very difficult to make, a difficulty associated with many definitional and other ambiguities.

All scenarios describe futures that are generally more affluent than today. Many of the scenarios envisage a more rapid
convergence in per capita income ratios in the world compared to the IS92 scenarios while, at the same time, they jointly
cover a wide range of GHGs and SO, emissions.

Emissions profiles are more dynamic than the IS92 scenarios, which reflects changes in future emissions trends for some
scenarios and GHG species.

The levels of GHG emissions are generally lower than the IS92 levels, especially toward the end of the 21* century, while
emissions of SO,, which have a cooling effect on the atmosphere, are significantly lower than in IS92.

Alternative combinations of main scenario driving forces can lead to similar levels of GHG emissions by the end of the
21* century. Scenarios with different underlying assumptions can result in very similar climate changes.

Technology is at least as important a driving force of GHG emissions as population and economic development across
the set of 40 SRES scenarios.

WGI:

"Assure that the SRES scenarios, their main assumptions, and modeling approaches are widely available through a web
site or a CD-ROM.

Establish a long-term facility for documentation and comparison of emissions scenarios to succeed the SRES open
process. This should include a scenario database and analytic evaluation capabilities and should be regularly maintained.
An effort should be made in the future to develop an appropriate emissions scenario classification scheme.

Identify resources for capacity building in the area of emissions scenarios and modeling tools, with a particular emphasis
to involve strong participation from developing countries.

Promote activities within and outside the IPCC to extend the SRES multi-baseline and multi-mode! approach in future
assessments of climate change impacts, adaptation, and mitigation.

Initiate new programs to assess GHG emissions from land use and sources of emissions other than energy-related CO,
emissions, to go beyond the effort of SRES, which was limited by time and resources.

Initiate new programs to assess future developments of driving forces and GHG emissions for different regions and for
different sectors (taking the set of SRES scenarios as reference for overall global and regional developments) to provide
more regional and sectorial detail than time and resources allowed SRES to achieve.
"	List
"It is recommended that a range of SRES scenarios from more than one family be used in any analysis. The scenario
groups — the three scenario families A2, B1, and B2, plus the groups within the Al scenario family, AIB, ALC & AIG
(combined into A1FI in the SPM), and AIT — and four cumulative emissions categories were developed as the smallest
subsets of SRES scenarios that capture the range of uncertainties associated with driving forces and emissions.

The important uncertainties may be different in different applications — for example climate modeling; assessment of
impacts, vulnerability, mitigation, and adaptation options; and policy analysis. Climate modelers may want to cover the
range reflected by the cumulative emissions categories. To assess the robustness of options in terms of impacts,
vulnerability, and adaptation may require scenarios with similar emissions but different socio-economic characteristics,
as reflected by the seven groups. For mitigation analysis, variation in both emissions and socio-economic characteristics
may be necessary. For analysis at the national or regional scale, the most appropriate scenarios may be those that best
reflect specific circumstances and perspectives.

There is no single most, likely “central” or “best-guess” scenario, either with respect to other SRES scenarios or to the
underlying scenario literature. Probabilities or likelihoods are not assigned to individual SRES scenarios. None of the
SRES scenarios represents an estimate of a central tendency for all driving forces and emissions, such as the mean or
median, and none should be interpreted as such. The statistics associated with the frequency distributions of SRES
scenarios do not represent the likelihood of their occurrence. The writing team cautions against constructing a central,
“best-estimate” scenario from the SRES scenarios; instead it recommends use of the SRES scenarios as they are.
Concerning large-scale climate models, the writing team recommends that the minimum set of SRES scenarios should
include the four designated marker scenarios and the two additional illustrative scenarios selected in the SPM from the
scenario groups in the Al family. At the minimum (a) a simulation for one and the same SRES marker scenario should
be performed by every TAR climate model for a given stabilization ceiling, and (b) the set of simulations performed by
the TAR climate models and stabilization runs for a given ceiling should include all four of the SRES marker scenarios
and the two additional illustrative scenarios selected in SPM from the scenario groups in the Al family.

The driving forces and emissions of each SRES scenario should be used together. To avoid internal inconsistencies,
components of SRES scenarios should not be mixed. For example, the GHG emissions from one scenario and the SO,
emissions from another scenario, or the population from one and economic development path from another, should not
be combined.

The SRES scenarios can provide policy makers with a long-term context for near-term decisions. This implies that they
are not necessarily well suited for the analysis of near-term developments. When analyzing mitigation and adaptation
options, the user should be aware that although no additional climate initiatives are included in the SRES scenarios,
various changes have been assumed to occur that would require other policy interventions.

All 40 SRES emissions scenarios, their main driving forces, and underlying assumptions should be made widely
available. Depending on resources available the scenario documentation, should e.g., be placed on the web and made
available on a CD-ROM. In addition, the time-dependent geographic distributions of the concentrations of GHGs and
sulfate aerosol burden, together with their corresponding radiative forcings, should also be placed on the web.

"The set of SRES emissions scenarios is based on an extensive
assessment of the literature, six alternative modeling

participation and feedback from many groups and individuals.
The set of scenarios includes anthropogenic emissions of all
relevant GHG species and sulfur dioxide (SO,), carbon
monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NO,) and non-methane
volatile organic hydrocarbons (VOCs), as shown in Table 1-1.
It covers most of the range of GHG emissions compared with
the published scenario literature. For example, in the SRES
scenarios, emissions of CO, in 2100 range from more than 40
to less than 6 giga (or billion) tons? of elemental carbon (GtC),

emissions level as in 1990.

"Future emissions and the evolution of their underlying driving
forces are highly uncertain, as reflected in the very wide range
of future emissions paths in the literature. Of the many ways
that uncertainties have been classified in the literature (see Box
1-1 in Section 1.2 below), this introduction uses the three
categories of Funtowicz and Ravetz (1990): “data
uncertainties,” “modeling uncertainties” and “completeness
uncertainties.” This categorization has the advantages of a
small number of categories and of clear descriptive titles. Data
uncertainties reflect the reality that most historical and base
year data sets are neither fully complete nor fully reliable. This
is certainly true for data on population, energy consumption,
energy efficiency, gross world product, energy resources and
reserves, and probably true for every parameter mentioned in
this report. Modeling uncertainties refer both to the
approximations necessary in any model of complex
phenomena like GHG emissions, and to the range of plausible
but different modeling approaches, each with its own strengths
and weaknesses, Completeness uncertainties encompass, first,
relevant factors that can be identified but are nonetheless
excluded from an analysis — for example exclusion of criteria
other than cost minimization in an energy model, such as
energy security, the protection of domestic industries, and free
trade. Second, they also include factors that may be relevant
but are as essentially unknown to us as jet airplanes were to
Thomas Malthus or 3-D seismic techniques in oil exploration
were to John D. Rockefeller. The use of scenarios and
storylines in this report partially addresses completeness
uncertainties related to known factors. Completeness
uncertainties related to unknown factors can, of course, never
be persuasively captured by any approach.

qualitative narratives or stories about the future and
quantitative formulations based on formal modeling. As such
they enhance our understanding of how systems work, behave
and evolve. Scenarios are useful tools for scientific
assessments, for learning about complex systems behavior and
for policy making (Jefferson, 1983; Davis, 1999). In scientific
assessments, scenarios are usually based on an internally

about the key relationships and driving forces of change, which

encountered. A large uncertainty surrounds future emissions and the possible evolution of their underlying driving forces, as
reflected in a wide range of future emissions paths in the literature. The uncertainty is further compounded in going from
emissions paths to climate change, from climate change to possible impacts and finally from these driving forces to formulating
adaptation and mitigation measures and policies. The uncertainties range from inadequate scientific understanding of the
problems, data gaps and general lack of data to inherent uncertainties of future events in general. Hence the use of alternative

"In general, there are three types of uncertainty: uncertainty in quantities, uncertainty about model structure and uncertainties
that arise from disagreements among experts about the value of quantities or the functional form of the model (Morgan and
Henrion, 1990). Sources of uncertainty could be statistical variation, subjective judgment (systematic ezror), imperfect
definition (linguistic imprecision), natural variability, disagreement among experts and approximation (Morgan and Henrion,
1990). Others (Funtowicz and Ravetz, 1990) distinguish three main sources of uncertainty: “data uncertainties,” “modeling
uncertainties” and “completeness uncertainties.” Data uncertainties arise from the quality or appropriateness of the data used as
inputs to models. Modeling uncertainties arise from an incomplete understanding of the modeled phenomena, or from
approximations that are used in formal representation of the processes. Completeness uncertainties refer to all omissions due to
lack of knowledge. They are, in principle, non-quantifiable and irreducible.

"Although no scenarios are value free, it is often useful to
distinguish between normative and descriptive scenarios.
Normative (or prescriptive) scenarios are explicitly vaiues-
based and teleologic, exploring the routes to desired or
undesired endpoints (utopias or dystopias). Descriptive
scenarios are evolutionary and open-ended, exploring paths
into the future. The SRES scenarios are descriptive and should
not be construed as desirable or undesirable in their own right.
They are built as descriptions of possible, rather than preferred,
developments. They represent pertinent, plausible, alternative
futures. Their pertinence is derived from the need for policy
makers and climate-change modelers to have a basis for
assessing the implications of future possible paths for GHG
and SO, emissions, and the possible response strategies. Their
plausibility is based on an extensive review of the emissions
scenarios available in the literature, and has been tested by
alternative modeling approaches, by peer review (including the
“open process” through the IPCC web site), and by the IPCC
review and approval processes. Good scenarios are challenging
and court controversy, since not everybody is comfortable with
every scenario, but used intelligently they allow policies and
strategies to be designed in a more robust way.

"However, to develop scenarios for a period of 100 years is a
relatively new field. Difficulties arise not only from large
scientific uncertainties and data inadequacies, but also because
people are not trained to think in such time-spans. We are
educated in narrow disciplines, and our ability to model
complex systems, at the global level, is still in its infancy. For
example, within the next century technological discontinuities
should be expected, and possibly major shifts in societal values
and in the balance of geopolitical power. The study of past
trends over such long periods is hampered because most
databases are incomplete if more than 50 years old. Given
these gaps in our data, methods and understanding, scenarios
are the best way to integrate our demographic, economic,
societal and technological knowledge with our understanding
of ecologic systems to evaluate sources and sinks of GHG
emissions. Scenarios as an integration tool in the assessment of
climate change allow a role for intuition, analysis and
synthesis, and thus we turn to scenarios to take advantage of
these features and aid the assessment of future climate change,
impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation and mitigation. Since the
scenarios focus on the century time scale, tools are used that
have been developed for this purpose. These tools are less
suitable for the analysis of near-term developments, so this
report does not intend to provide reliable projections for the
near term.

"The interests of these three user groups create certain
requirements that the SRES scenarios attempt to fulfill. For
example, climate modelers and those who analyze climate
impacts need scenarios on the order of 100 years because of the
long response time of the climate system. At the same time
adaptation-policy analysis tends to be focused more on the
medium-term, around 20 to 50 years. The SRES scenarios
attempt to include enough information and specific details to be
useful to these groups. Spatially explicit emissions and socio-
economic variables are required for slightly different reasons.
Some emissions, such as the SO, emissions that contribute to
sulfate aerosols, have impacts that vary depending on where they
are emitted. Climate modelers therefore need spatially explicit
emission estimates. Similarly, impacts depend on the geographic
patterns of changing temperatures, rainfall, humidity and cloud
cover, and how these compare to evolving socio-economic
patterns in specific scenarios. Impact modelers therefore need
spatially explicit estimates of, in particular, population growth,
migration, and the economic variables that reflect the expected
adaptability or vulnerability of different populations and regional
economies to different regional climate changes.

"Furthermore, since the development of the IS92 scenarios
much has changed in our understanding of both the possible
future GHG emissions and the climate impacts that might
result. The most straightforward change arises because the
IS92 scenarios had to estimate data for the base year 1990
(actual data were unavailable at the time), 1990 is no longer a
forecast year and actual data can be used. But other changes are
at least as important. It is now recognized that in some regions
SO, emissions may be as important to climate change as all
non-CO, greenhouse related gases combined — at least in the
near-term. As a result the rapid growth of SO, emissions in the
IS92 scenarios has been questioned. The 1994 evaluation of the
TS92 scenario series (Alcamo et al., 1995) concluded, for
instance, that projected emissions in the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries

input to climate models rather than a single scenario. This is in
stark contrast to the actual use of one particular scenario in the
set, the IS92a scenario, as the reference case in numerous
studies. In fact, the IS92a scenario is often referred to in
climate change modeling and impact studies as the “business-
as-usual” scenario and used as the only reference emissions
trajectory. The review concluded that the mere fact of the IS92a
being an intermediate, or central, CO, emissions scenario at the
global level does not equate it with being the most likely
scenario. Indeed, the conclusion was that there was no
objective basis on which to assign likelihood to any of the
scenarios. Furthermore, the [S92a scenario was shown to be
“central” for only a few of its salient characteristics such as
global population growth, global economic development and
global CO, emissions. In other ways, [S92a was found not to
be central with respect to the published literature, particularly
in some of its regional input assumptions. The same is the case
with the new set of SRES scenarios, as is shown below. No
single scenario can be central with respect to all the
characteristics relevant for different uses of emissions
scenarios and there is no objective way to assign likelihood to
any of the scenarios.

"As described at the beginning of this chapter, IPCC WGIIL
appointed the SRES writing team in January 1997, and the
team reached early consensus on the four major components of
an overall work program (outlined in Section 1.1). The SRES
team worked in close collaboration with colleagues on the
IPCC Task Group on Climate Scenarios for Impact Assessment
(TGCIA) and with colleagues from all three IPCC working
groups. As is evident from the four components of the work
program, it was agreed that the process be an open one with no
“official” model and no exclusive “expert teams.” High priority
was given to wide participation so that any research group
capable of preparing scenarios for any region could participate.
In 1997 the IPCC advertised in a number of relevant scientific
journals and other publications to solicit wide participation in
the process. All global modeling teams and regional modelers
were invited and encouraged to participate. In this way,
researchers with local expertise from both developing and
developed regions could contribute to the global exercise even
if their own research was exclusively regional. To facilitate
participation and improve the usefulness of the new scenarios,
the open-process web site mentioned above was created. The
open process provided a wide access to preliminary marker
(see below) SRES scenario results and greatly facilitated
coordination among the writing team. It also provided
feedback about the needs of those who would use the final
scenarios, and suggestions for improvements. The open
process also served to document all relevant results and
associated assumptions for the preliminary scenarios
developed by the participating modeling groups.

scenario quantifications. The marker scenarios are also those
SRES scenarios that have been most intensively tested in terms

also means that the 40 scenarios are not independent of each
other as they are all based on four storylines. However,
differences in modeling approaches have meant that not all of

"The first step in formulation of the SRES emissions scenarios
was 10 review both the published scenario literature and the
development of the scenario database accessible through the
web site (www-cger.nies.go.jp/cger-e/db/ipcc.html). Chapters
2 and 3 give a more detailed description of the literature review
and analysis. Figure 1-3 shows the global energy-related co,
emission paths from the database as “spaghetti” curves for the
period to 2100 against the background of the historical
emissions from 1900 to 1990, These curves are plotted against
an index on the vertical axis rather than as absolute values
because of the large differences and discrepancies for the
values assumed for the base year 1990. These sometimes arise
from genuine differences among the scenarios (e.g., different
data sources, definitions) and sometimes from different base
years assumed in the analysis or in alternative calibrations.’
The differences among the scenarios in the specification of the
base year illustrate the large genuine scientific and data
uncertainty that surrounds emissions and their main driving
forces captured in the scenarios. The literature includes
scenarios with additional climate polices, which are sometimes
referred to as mitigation or intervention scenarios. There are
many ambiguities associated with the classification of
emissions scenarios into those that include additional climate
initiatives and those that do not. Many cannot be classified in
this way on basis of the information available from the
database. Figure 1-3 indicates the ranges of emissions in 2100
from scenarios that apparently include additional climate
initiatives (designated as intervention emissions range), those
that do not (non-intervention) and those that cannot be
assigned to either of these two categories (non-classified), This
classification is based on the subjective evaluation of the
scenarios in the database by the members of the writing team
and is explained in Chapter 2. The range of the whole sample
of scenarios has significant overlap with the range of those that
cannot be classified and they share virtually the same median
(15.7 and 15.2 GtC in 2100, respectively) but the non-classified
scenarios do not cover the high part of the range. Also, the
range of the scenarios that apparently do not include climate
polices (non-intervention) has considerable overlap with the
other two ranges (lower bound is higher) but with a
significantly higher median (of 21.3 GtC in 2100).

"Historically, gross CO, emissions have increased at an average
rate of about 1.7% per year since 1900 (Nakicenovié et al.,

double during the next three to four decades and increase more
than sixfold by 2100. Many scenarios in the database describe
such a development. However, the range is very large around
this historical trend so that the highest scenarios envisage more
than a sevenfold increase of global emissions by 2100 as
compared with 1990, while the lowest have emissions lower
than those of today. The median and the average of the
scenarios lead to about a threefold emissions increase over the
same time period or to about 16 GtC. This is lower than the
median of the IS92 set and is lower than the IS92a scenario,
often considered as the “central” scenario with respect to some
of its tendencies. However, the distribution of emissions is
asymmetric, The thin emissions “tail” that extends above the
95 percentile (ie., between the six and tenfold increase of
emissions by 2100 compared to 1990) includes only a few

actual global energy-related and industrial CO, emissions were about 6 GtC. The coverage of CO, emissions sources may vary

Model: a formal representation of a system that allows quantification of relevant system variables.

Storyline: a narrative description of a scenario (or a family of scenarios) highlighting the main scenario characteristics,
relationships between key driving forces, and the dynamics of the scenarios.

Scenario: a description of a potential future, based on a clear logic and a quantified storyline.

Family: scenarios that have a similar demographic, societal, economic and technical-change storyline. Four scenario families
comprise the SRES: Al, A2, B1 and B2,

Group: scenarios within a family that reflect a variation of the storyline. The Al scenario family includes four groups designated
by AIT, AIC, AIG and A1B (see also note below) that explore alternative structures of future energy systems. In the Summary
for Policymakers, the AIC and A1G groups have been combined into one ""fossil intensive"" A1FI scenario group, thus reducing
the number of groups constituting the Al scenario family to three. The other three scenario families consist of one group each.
Category: scenarios are grouped into four categories of cumulative CO, emissions between 1990 and 2100: low, medium-low,
medium-high, and high emissions. Each category contains scenarios with a range of different driving forces yet similar
cumulative emissions.

Marker: a scenario that was originally posted on the SRES web site to represent a given scenario family. A marker is not
necessarily the median or mean scenario.

Illustrative: a scenario that is illustrative for each of the six scenario groups reflected in the Summary for Policymakers of this
report (after combining A1G and AIC into a single A1FI group). They include four revised ""scenario markers"" for the scenario
groups A1B, A2, B1 and B2, and two additional illustrative scenarios for the A1FI and AIT groups. See also ""(Scenario) Groups""
and “(Scenario) Markers.”

Harmonized: harmonized scenarios within a family share common assumptions for global population and GDP while fully
harmonized scenarios are within 5% of the population projections specified for the respective marker scenario, within 10% of
the GDP and within 10% of the marker scenario’s final energy consumption.

Standardized: emissions for 1990 and 2000 are indexed to have the same values.

this distribution, which implies that a similar quantification of
driving forces can lead to a wide range of future emissions.
More specifically, a given combination of the main driving
forces is not sufficient to uniquely determine a future emissions
path. There are too many uncertainties. The fact that each of the
scenario families covers a substantial part of the literature
range also leads to an overlap in the emissions ranges of the
four families. This implies that a given level of future
emissions can arise from very different combinations of
driving forces. This result is of fundamental importance for the
assessment of climate-change impacts and possible mitigation
and adaptation strategies. Thus, it warrants some further
discussion. The emissions paths of the Al and B2 scenario
families perhaps best illustrate these implications,

scenarios that span most of the emissions range for the Al

the main driving forces. This indicates that different structures
of the energy system can lead to basically the same variation in
future emissions as can be generated by different combinations
of the other main driving forces — population, economic
activities and energy consumption levels. The implication is
that decarbonization of energy systems — the shift from carbon-
intensive to less carbon-intensive and carbon-free sources of
energy ~ is of similar importance in determining the future
emissions paths as other driving forces. Sustained
decarbonization requires the development and successful
diffusion of new technologies. Thus investments in new
technologies during the coming decades might have the same
order of influence on future emissions as population growth,
economic development and levels of energy consumption taken

"1990 and 2100. This categorization can guide comparisons
using either scenarios with different driving forces yet similar
emissions, or scenarios with similar driving forces but different
emissions. This characteristic of SRES scenarios also has very
important implications for the assessment of climate-change
impacts, mitigation and adaptation strategies. Two future
worlds with fundamentally different characteristic features,
such as AIB and B2 marker scenarios, also have different
cumulative CO, emissions and radiative forcing, but very
similar CO, emissions in 2100. In contrast, scenarios that are
in the same category of cumulative emissions can have
fundamentally different driving forces and different CO,
emissions in 2100, but very similar cumulative emissions and
radiative forcing. Presumably, adverse impacts and effective
adaptation measures would vary among the scenarios from
different families that share similar cumulative emissions but
have different demographic, socio-economic and technological
driving forces. This is another reason for considering the entire
range of future emissions in future assessments of climate
change. There is no single “best guess” or central scenario.
"	List
"The SRES emissions scenarios also have different emissions
for other GHGs and chemically active species such as carbon
monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic hydrocarbons.
The emissions of other gases follow dynamic patterns much
like those shown in Figure 1-6 for CO, emissions. Further
details about GHG emissions are given in Chapter 5. Emissions
of sulfur aerosol precursors portray even more dynamic
patterns in time and space than the CO, emissions shown in
Figure 1-6. Factors other than climate change, namely regional
and local air quality, and transformations in the structure of the
energy system and end use intervene to limit future emissions.
In view of the significant adverse impacts, SO, emissions in
the scenarios are increasingly controlled outside countries of
the OECD. As such the SRES scenarios reflect both recent
legislation in North America and in Europe and recent policy
initiatives in a number of developing countries aimed at
reducing SO, emissions (reviewed in more detail in Chapters 3
and 5). As a result, in the second half of the 21% century both
the trends and regional patterns of SO, emissions evolve
differently from those of CO, emissions in the SRES scenarios.
Emissions outside OECD90 rise initially, most notably in
ASIA, and compensate for declining OECD90 emissions. Over
the long term, however, SO, emissions decline throughout the
world, but the timing and magnitude vary across the scenarios.
One important implication of this varying pattern of SO,
emissions is that the historically important, but uncertain
negative radiative forcing of sulfate aerosols may decline in the
very long run.

the most important scenario driving forces and emissions, the
complexity of possible relationships between driving forces and
emissions, and the associated uncertainties that characterize
alternative future developments. The SRES scenarios cover most
of the range of the GHG emissions scenarios found in the
literature, including the International Panel on Climate Change

"Presented in this chapter is the assessment of more than 400

provide an important input for the assessment of future climate
change. Future anthropogenic GHG emissions depend on
numerous driving forces, including population growth,
economic development, energy supply and use, land-use
patterns, and a host of other human activities. These main
driving forces that determine the emissions trajectories in the
scenarios often also provide input to assess possible emissions
mitigation strategies and possible impacts of unabated
emissions. In view of the many different uses, it is not
surprising that numerous emissions scenarios are presented in
the literature and that the number of regional and global
emissions scenarios is growing.

"The scenarios in the database display a large range of future
GHG emissions. Part of the range can be attributed to the
different methods and models used to formulate the scenarios,
which include simple spreadsheet models, economic models,
and systems-engineering models. However, most of the range
results from differences in the input assumptions of the
scenarios, in particular those of the main scenario driving
forces. In addition, simply to compare alternative emissions
levels across different scenarios is not sufficient to shed light
on internal consistency, plausibility, and comparability of the
assumptions behind the scenarios. Analysis of the underlying
driving forces is thus also an important part of the evaluation.
This chapter provides an analysis of the main driving forces,
such as population growth, economic growth, energy
consumption, and energy and carbon intensities. Some of these
driving forces are specified as model inputs, and some are
derived from model outputs, so it is necessary to determine the
assumed relationships among the main driving forces.

"Japan for SRES (Morita and Lee, 1998). The database
version of 3 April 1998, which is assessed in this chapter,
includes 416 different scenarios. The current database
version can be accessed through an_ ftp-site
(www-cger.nies.go.jp/cger-e/db/ipcc.html). It is the most
comprehensive collection of emissions scenarios in the
publicly available literature. It includes most of the recent
global and regional scenarios and all of the scenarios used in
the latest IPCC evaluation of emissions scenarios (Alcamo et
al., 1995), Therefore, the emissions scenarios documented in
the database are representative of the literature in general.
However, there are a number of ways in which the coverage
of the scenarios in the database could be extended in the
future. For example, inclusion of long-term emissions
scenarios for individual countries, when available, would
improve the regional coverage (e.g., Parikh, 1996; Murthy et
al., 1997). Also, a large majority of the scenarios report only
energy-related carbon dioxide (CO,) emissions (230
scenarios), while only some report non-energy CO, and other
GHG emissions. This shortcoming of the emissions scenarios
in the literature was identified in the last IPCC evaluation
(Alcamo et al., 1995).

famous example is that of the Shell Group in the wake of the
so-called oil crisis, which used scenarios to plan the corporate
response strategies (Jefferson, 1983; Schwartz, 1991). Today,
the use of scenarios is quite widespread.. Many scenarios,

"During the past three decades many global studies have used
scenarios as a tool to assess future CO, (and in a few cases also
other GHG) emissions. One of the first such global studies was
Energy in a Finite World, conducted by the International
Institute of Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) during the late
1970s (Hafele et al., 1981). Another influential series of
scenarios that included the assessment of CO, emissions was
developed by the World Energy Council (WEC, 1993).
Recently, IASA and WEC jointly presented a set of global and
regional scenarios that were developed with a set of integrated
assessment models and then reviewed and revised through 11
regional expert groups (Nakiéenovié ef a/., 1998b). Another

"Scenarios of future emissions played an important role from
the beginning of the IPCC work. In 1990, the IPCC initiated
the development of its first set of GHG emissions scenarios
designed to serve as inputs to general circulation models
(GCMs) and facilitate the assessments of climate-change
impacts (Houghton er af., 1990). Two years later, in 1992, the
IPCC approved six new emissions scenarios (IS92) that
provided alternative emissions trajectories for the years 1990
through 2100 for such radiatively active gases as CO,, carbon
monoxide (CO), methane (CH,), nitrous oxide (N,O), nitrogen
oxides (NO,), and sulfur dioxide (SO,) (Leggett et al., 1992).
They were widely used by atmospheric and climate scientists
in the preparation of scenarios of atmospheric composition and
climate change (Alcamo et al., 1995), In many ways, the 1S92
scenarios were pathbreaking. They were the first global
scenarios to provide estimates of the full suite of GHGs and at
the time were the only scenarios to provide emissions

"The SRES scenarios employ both approaches — a storyline that
gives a broad, narrative, and qualitative scenario description
plus a number of quantifications of each storyline with six
different models. Thus, even though both narrative stories and
quantitative scenarios are an integral part of the SRES
emissions scenarios, the literature review focused on the
documentation and the assessment of quantitative scenarios,
for two reasons. First, it was not possible to devise a
classification system that would allow the documentation of
many different forms of narrative scenarios. Second, the SRES
objective was to develop a set of numeric emissions scenarios
for use in the IPCC and other assessments of climate change.
Therefore, in this chapter the focus is only on the literature
review of quantitative scenarios. A more detailed discussion of
narrative scenarios is given in Chapter 4; it deals with the four
SRES storylines and how they are related to recent work in the

the most recent IPCC evaluation of emissions scenarios

of policy intervention are referred to as intervention scenarios,
while those that do not assume any climate policy measures,
such as the 40 SRES scenarios, are referred to as non-

intervention or non-intervention, such as those developed to
assess sustainable development. These studies consider futures
that require radical policy and behavioral changes to achieve a
transition to a sustainable development path; Greenpeace
formulated one of the first (Lazarus et al., 1993). This class of
scenarios describes low emissions futures that sometimes, but
not always, result from specific climate policy measures. Such
sustainable development scenarios are also included in this
assessment of the scenario literature. Where they do not
include the explicit policies of the SRES criteria, they can be
classified as non-intervention scenarios. However, there is a
great deal of ambiguity as to what constitutes policies directed
at climate change, as opposed to those directed at achieving
sustainable development in general. Thus, some of these
sustainable development scenarios are “non-classified” (i.e.,
the information available is insufficient to determine whether
or not the scenarios included any additional climate policy
initiatives).

"An important group of emissions scenarios included in this
literature review was compiled from two international scenario
and model comparison activities. This first group is from the
IEW and involves structured comparisons of energy and
emissions scenarios since 1981 (Manne and Schrattenholzer,
1996, 1997). The participating groups provide information for
a standardized scenario poll from which the ranges and other
sample statistics are reported for the main driving forces and
emissions. The other group is the EMF (Weyant, 1993) and
also involves regular scenario comparisons, in addition to
standardized input assumptions, such as the international oil
price or carbon emissions taxes. Both of these international
scenario comparison activities provide a large share of the data
for this scenario review and comparison. They include most of
the global and regional emissions scenarios developed by
formal modeling approaches. A large part of these activities is
based on the use of scenarios for the purpose of climate-change
research. A third scientific effort that involves scenario
comparisons is the Energy Technology Systems Analysis
Programme (ETSAP; Kram, 1993) supported by the
International Energy Agency (IEA). The ETSAP work involves
scenario analysis by more than 40 scientific groups from about
20 countrics using the same modeling approach.

"The information documented in the database about emissions
scenarios illustrates both areas that are well covered in the
scenario literature and areas with substantial gaps in
knowledge. For example, the information in the database
strongly confirms the findings of the latest IPCC scenario
assessment and evaluation (Alcamo et al., 1995). One of the
key findings is that of all GHG emissions, CO, emissions are
by far the most frequently studied, and that of all the CO,
emissions sources, fossil fuel is the source most extensively
analyzed in the literature. In part, this is because energy-related
sources of CO, emissions contribute more to the current and
potential future climate forcing than any other single GHG
released by any other human activity. In part, this is also
because of improved data, assessment methods, and models for
energy-related activities than for other emissions sources.
Another information gap example is the rather diverse regional
disaggregation chosen for different scenarios. Even when the
regions are similar or equivalent in terms of this assessment,
the names are sometimes different, which hampers
comparisons, Such gaps in knowledge limit the range and
effectiveness of the various policy options that logically follow
from the discussion. This creates a level of uncertainty that can
only be addressed by concentrated research efforts.

"The database serves primarily to document the GHG emissions,
including CO,, CH,, N,O, CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons), HFCs
(hydrofluorocarbons), and other radiatively active gases such as
SO,, CO, and NO,,. In addition, it includes information about
the main driving forces of GHG emissions, such as population
growth and economic development, usually expressed in terms
of gross domestic product (GDP), energy consumption, and
land use. Each of these scenario characteristics has
subcategories and different values in time and space. The
temporal dimension is often in steps of 10 years, but this is not
standardized across the scenarios in the database. The spatial
dimension refers to the regional disaggregation of the
scenarios. Priority was given to covering all accessible
quantitative scenarios with global and regional coverage. The
main scenario characteristics are documented by the name and

chosen to present the main scenario driving forces because it
corresponds to their representation in the Kaya identity; it does
not imply a priori any causal relationships among the driving
forces themselves or between the driving forces and CO,
emissions.

"Apart from its simplicity, an advantage of analysis that uses the
Kaya identity to decompose emissions into four main driving
forces is that it facilitates at least some standardization in the
comparison and analysis of many diverse emissions scenarios.
This decomposition is very useful because it indicates where to
seek differences in scenario assumptions that may account for
differences in the resultant GHG emissions (Alcamo et al.,
1995). However, the identity is not used here to suggest
causality. An important caveat is that these driving forces are
not independent of each other; in many scenarios they
explicitly depend on each other. For example, scenario builders
often assume that high rates of economic growth lead to high
capital turnover. This favors more advanced and more efficient
technologics, which result in lower energy intensities.
Sometimes a weak inverse relationship is assumed between
population and economic growth. Thus, the scenario ranges for
these main driving forces are not (necessarily) independent of
each other. (See also the discussion of the relationships
between the main scenario driving forces in Chapter 3.)

more than a factor ten difference (after normalizing for base-year differences) between the highest and lowest scenarios in 2020.
(For reference, the IS92a scenario falls slightly below the median of the range.) By 2050, however, the gap between the extremes
narrows, and by 2100 the range is very small indeed: the highest scenario shows CO, emissions from land use only 2.4 times as
great as those found in the lowest scenario. All 26 scenarios in the database report CO, emissions of less than 1 GtC originating

"About 23% of the current total anthropogenic CO, emissions arise from land-use change (Pepper et al., 1992), which makes
it an important driving force. Direct comparison of absolute levels of land-use CO, emissions between scenarios in the
database is difficult because of variations in how models depict deforestation and in how modelers classify anthropogenic and
natural land-use fluxes. In addition, models are based on different base-year data, which further complicates comparison. For
example, the 1990 base-year emissions estimates from land-use change (e.g., deforestation) range from 0.6 to 1.4 gigatons of
elemental carbon (GtC). However, by indexing emissions to 1990, it is possible to make more meaningful comparisons of
trends among the 26 scenarios in the SRES database that report land-use CO, emissions, It is important to note that only three
modeling groups produced the 26 scenarios described here. Clearly, emissions from land-use change have not been as well
explored by the modeling community as energy-related emissions.

the range is from 27 to 4 GtC for the 75"" and 25"" percentiles.

1999), World Bank (Bos and Vu, 1994), and ITASA (Lutz et al.,

of the “central” population projections lead to a doubling of
global population by 2100 (to about 10 billion people
compared to 5.3 billion in 1990), In recent years the central
population projections for the year 2100 have declined
somewhat, but are still in line with a doubling by 2100. For
example, the latest UN (1998) medium—low and medium-high
projections indicate a range of between 7.2 and 14.6 billion
people by 2100, with the medium scenario at 10.4 billion. The
IIASA central estimate for 2100 is also 10.4 billion, with a

"In 2100, the distribution of primary energy consumption is
much less concentrated and covers the full range, from about
10 times the 1990 level (to 3400 EJ) to a slight decrease by a
factor of 0.9 (340 EJ). However, only a few scenarios occur
toward these extreme values of the two distribution tails. The
rest of the observations portray an interesting structure that
resembles a trimodal distribution. The first mode is around
2600 EJ, the second around 1700 EJ, and the third at about 700
EJ. The median of the whole distribution is at 1500 EJ.
Interestingly, the continuation of the historical growth rate of
about 2.2% per year corresponds to about 11 times the 1990
level (about 4050 EJ in 2100), well above any values observed
in the database. Thus, in contrast to data for 2050, all the
scenarios for 2100 foresee a level of primary energy
consumption that is lower than that of trend extrapolation.
Altogether, 127 different scenarios were used to derive the

However, it is important to recognize that this is a result of the
inputs, assumptions, methods, and types of models used to
calculate the scenarios.

"Figure 2-13 illustrates the database distributions of CO,,
population, gross world product, primary energy, and carbon
intensity of energy. The circles closest to the center denote the
minimum value of the distribution; the solid circles denote the
median value; and the shaded circles represent the maximum
database value for each variable. While the values are
connected in the form of a snowflake, it is important to note
that those of a given range (e.g., minimum, median, and
maximum), taken together, do not necessarily yield a
consistent or logically possible scenario. As is shown in
Chapter 4 (Figure 4-4), actual scenarios may fall into a median
range on some axes and into a higher or lower range on others.
Snowflake diagrams are useful because they allow the reader to
see at a glance the full range of values encompassed by the
database. Subsequent snowflake diagrams plot SRES scenario
values on the various axes to illustrate where the scenarios fall
relative to the database minimum, median, and maximum
values. Snowflake diagrams should be used only for purposes
of scenario classification and interpretation and not for
scenario design, since the latter could lead to logical
inconsistencies.

"the ranges over which the driving forces vary are large,
which contribuies to the wide range of future
emissions;

of these driving forces, gross world product and
population are often exogenous, while carbon and
energy intensity are not;

the frequency distributions of driving forces and
emissions are asymmetric, with long tails and often
more than one peak;

for many driving forces the median and mean are closer
to the minimum than to the maximum;

lack of information as to whether climate intervention
policies and measures were included in the scenarios,
for about 40 scenarios, means that it is not possible to
distinguish between intervention and non-intervention
scenarios;

it is hoped that IPCC or another international institution
will, in the future, maintain this or a similar,database so
as to assure a continuity of knowledge and scientific
progress in GHG emissions scenarios (an equivalent
database to document narrative and other qualitative
scenarios would also be very useful for future climate-
change assessments); and

it would be useful in the future to evaluate the
consistency of the driving forces and results of all
scenarios included in the scenario database. In addition,
it would be helpful to extend the database to include
land-use change data where currently only land-use
emissions are presented. As noted above, only a small
percentage of scenarios contain information on land
use.

"While the Kaya identity above can be used to organize
discussion of the primary driving forces of CO, emissions and,
by extension, emissions of other GHGs, there are important
caveats. Most important, the four terms on the right-hand side
of equation (3.2) should be considered neither as fundamental
driving forces in themselves, nor as generally independent
from each other.
"	Text
"Although, at face value, the IPAT and Kaya identities suggest
that CO, emissions grow linearly with population increases,
this depends on the real (or modeled) interactions between
demographics and economic growth (see Section 3.2) as well
as on those between technology, economic structure, and
affluence (Section 3.3). In principle, such interactions preclude
a simple linear interpretation of the role of population growth
in emissions.
"	Text
"Global analysis is often not instructive and even misleading,
because of the great heterogeneity among populations with
respect to GHG emissions. The ratios of per capita emissions
of the world’s richest countries to those of its poorest countries
approach several hundred (Parikh ef a/., 1991; Engelman,
1994). Of course, some level of aggregation is necessary. In
practice, the models used to produce emissions scenarios in
this report, for example, operate on the basis of 9-15 regions
(see Appendix IV, Table IV-1). This level of detail isolates the
most important differences, particularly with respect to
industrial versus developing countries (Lutz, 1993).
"	Text
"The IPAT identity states that environmental impacts (e.g.,
emissions) are the product of the level of population times
affluence (income per capita, ie. gross domestic product
(GDP) divided by population) times the level of technology
deployed (emissions per unit of income). The IPAT identity has
been widely discussed in analyses of energy-related carbon
dioxide (CO,) emissions (e.g., Ogawa, 1991; Parikh et al.,
1991; Nakiéenovié et al., 1993; Parikh, 1994; Alcamo et al.,
1995; Gaffin and O’ Neill, 1997; Giirer and Ban, 1997; O’Neill
et al., 2000), in which it is often referred to as the Kaya identity
(Kaya, 1990), equation (3.2).
"	Text
"The spatial and temporal heterogeneity of emission growth that
becomes masked in the global aggregates is shown in Figure
3-1, in which the growth in energy-related CO, emissions
since 1970 is broken down into a number of subcomponents.
For industrial countries the population growth has been modest
and their emissions have evolved roughly in line with increases
(or declines) in economic activity. For developing countries
both population and income growth appear as important drivers
of emissions. However, even in developing countries the
regional heterogeneity becomes masked in the aggregate
analysis (Griibler et al., 1993a).
"	Text
"Some of the major driving forces of past and future
anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which
include demographics, economics, resources, technology, and
(non-climate) policies, are reviewed in this chapter. Economic,
social, and technical systems and their interactions are highly
complex and only a limited overview is provided in this
chapter. The discussion of major scenario driving forces herein
is structured by considering the links from demography and
the economy to resource use and emissions. A frequently used
approach to organize discussion of the drivers of emissions is
through the so-called IPAT identity, equation (3.1).
"	Text
"The Kaya multiplicative identity also underlies the analysis of
the emissions scenario literature (Chapter 2). It can be broken
down into further subcomponents. For instance, the energy
component can be decomposed into fossil and non-fossil
shares, and emissions can be expressed as carbon emissions per
unit of fossil energy, as shown in Figure 3-1 (Giirer and Ban,
1997). A property of the multiplicative identity is that
component growth rates are additive. For instance, global
energy-related CO, emissions since the middle of the 19""
century are estimated to have increased by approximately 1.7%
per year (Watson et al., 1996). This growth rate can be
decomposed roughly into a 3% growth in gross world product
(the sum of a 1% growth in population and a 2% growth in per
capita income) minus a 1% per year decline in the energy
intensity of world GDP (the third term in equation (3.2)) and a
decline in the carbon intensity of primary energy (the fourth
term) of 0.3% per year (Naki¢enovié et al., 1993; Watson et al.,
1996).
"	Text
"Demographic development interacts in many ways with social
and economic development. Fertility and mortality trends
depend, among other things, on education, income, social
norms, and health provisions. In turn, these determine the size
and age composition of the population. Many of these factors
combined are recognized as necessary to explain long-run
productivity, economic growth, economic structure, and
technological change (Barro, 1997). In turn, long-run per
capita economic growth and structural change are closely
linked with advances in knowledge and technological change.
Tn fact, long-run growth accounts (e.g., Solow, 1956; Denison,
1962, 1985; Maddison, 1989, 1995; Barro and Sala-I-Martin,
1995) confirm that advances in knowledge and technology may
be the most important reason for long-run economic growth;
more important even than growth in other factors of production
such as capital and labor. Abramovitz (1993) demonstrates that
capital and labor productivity cannot be treated as independent
from technological change. Therefore, it is not possible to treat
the affluence and technology variables in IPAT as independent
of each other.

"The next five sections review the major driving forces of GHG
emissions within the IPAT identity. Section 3.2 discusses the
role of population, Section 3.3 addresses economi¢ and social
development processes (including technological change),
"	Text
"Most innovative efforts in the past two centuries were devoted
to improving labor productivity and the human ability to
harness resources for economic purposes. While material and
energy efficiency improved slowly, economic growth was
faster and thus aggregate resource use increased.
"	Text
"Finally, and importantly, the high uncertainty with regard to the
nature and extent of the relationships between driving forces of
GHG emissions means that, with current knowledge, it is not
possible ta develop probabilistic future emission scenarios.
Even if it were possible to derive (subjective) probability
distributions of the future evolution of individual scenario
driving-force variables (like population, economic growth, or
technological change), the nature of their relationships is
known only qualitatively at best or remains uncertain (and
controversial) in many instances.

"decline, a relationship often referred to as the “environmental
Kuznets curve.” This process seems well established for
traditional pollutants, such as particulates and sulfur (e.g.,
World Bank, 1992; Kato, 1996; Viguier, 1999), and there have
been some claims that it might apply to GHG emissions.
Schmalensee et al. (1998) found that CO, emissions have
flattened and may have reversed for highly developed
economies such as the US and Japan. Other researchers argue
that the Kuznets curve does not apply to GHG emissions
(Pearce, 1995; Galeotti and Lanza, 1999, Viguier, 1999). The
flattening in emissions can be explained by normal market
processes and does not appear to result from a willingness to
pay to protect the global environment. Urbanization,
infrastructure, poverty, and income distribution are other
factors in the complex interplay between population, economy,
and environment (see, e.g., Rotmans and de Vries, 1997; de
Vries et al., 1999; O’Neill et al., 2000).
"	Text
"Technological, economic, and social innovation have long been
means by which a greater number of people can live from the
same environmental resources. The best known historical
examples of major periods of innovation include the Neolithic
revolution (beginnings of organized agriculture from around
10,000 years ago); and the industrial revolution that began two
centuries ago (Rosenberg and Birdzell, 1986). In each case,
changes in patterns of primary production (food, energy,
materials) are linked to changes in social organization,
institutions, economy, and technology (e.g., Mumford, 1934;
Campbell, 1959; Landes, 1969; Hill, 1975; Wilber, 1981;
Buchanan, 1992; Reynolds and Cutcliffe, 1997). The most
remarkable change in recent decades is the so-called
demographic transition, which has led to a stabilization of
population in many parts of the world. No single one of these
changes can be considered as the primary driver, and they
cannot be considered as independent from each other: each
play a role in an interconnected system.

"World annual population growth rates probably averaged less
than 0.6% during the 18"" and 19"" centuries, passed the 1% rate
around 1920, and peaked at 2.04% in the late 1960s (UN,
1998). This peak coincided with growing international concern
about population growth in general. World population reached
1 billion in 1804, 2 billion in 1927, 3 billion in 1960, 4 billion
in 1974, and 5 billion in 1987, reaching the 6 billion level
shortly before the millenium (UN, 1998).
"	Text
"The population of the developing regions increased from 1.71
billion in 1950 to 4.59 billion in 1996, with annual growth rates
dropping from a peak of 2.5% in 1965 to 1.7% presently. The
population of the more-developed regions increased from 813
million to 1.18 billion over the same period, with annual
growth rates dropping from 1.2% in 1950 to 0.4% presently
(UN, 1998), Population distribution and growth thus differ
markedly among major geographic regions. Latin America and
the Caribbean was the fastest growing region between 1950
and 1970, followed by Africa, and this is projected to remain
the case until 2050 (UN, 1998). Table 3-1 shows the population
levels of the major geographic areas between 1800 and the
present.

"Population projections are arguably the backbone of GHG
emissions scenarios, and are comparable in some ways with
them, Population projections cover timeframes of a century or
more, and they involve social and economic considerations and
uncertainties similar to those in GHG emissions scenarios.
Population projections are among the most commonly cited
indicators of the future state of the world. Compared to the
multitude of projection efforts they have a relatively high
accuracy in the near-to-medium term. Even so the future is
always unknowable and surprises are in store, as confirmed by
a cursory review of the past history of population projections in
which fundamental events were largely unforeseen (post-
World War II baby boom, acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (AIDS) or the recent rapidity of fertility decline in
developing countries)).

policies and their potential impact on the principal driving
forces of future emissions. Each section briefly reviews past
trends, available scenarios, and important new methodological
and empirical advances since the publication of previous
International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emissions
scenarios in 1992 (IS92), This chapter provides the background
to establish recommendations for the range of driving-force
variables to be explored in the new set of scenarios. The
available literature and current understanding of the inherent
uncertainties in developing very long-term scenarios are
reflected. Each section elucidates in detail the important
relationships between scenario driving forces, as the question
of relationships is a new and important mandate for SRES.
Nonetheless, most attention is paid to the possible relationships
between population and economic growth, because this is the
area most intensively discussed in the literature.

"Wexler (1996) surveyed the world population projections used
in GHG emissions scenarios since 1990. Of the models
surveyed, all but one employed the World Bank central
projections. The sole exception — the DICE model of
Nordhaus (1993; Nordhaus and Yohe, 1983) — used
algorithmic projections based on assumed declining
population growth rates. As noted in Chapter 2, many long-
term emission scenarios available in the literature do not even
report their underlying population projections. In general,
World Bank projections have been more heavily employed
than the UN projections, apparently because of the shorter
time horizon and longer cycle time of the UN Long Range
projections. UN Revisions until 1994 extended only to 2025
(now to 2050), which is too short for emissions scenarios. The
UN Long Range series is revised less frequently, with a six-
year interval between the previous two UN Long Range
projections. The World Bank, in contrast, updates its published
projection every two years, and it has always been a long-
range projection, out to year 2150. In addition, the World Bank
maintains a country-level disaggregation throughout its
projection, unlike the UN Long Range series, which switches
to a nine-region summary.

decrease is a faster-than-anticipated decline in fertility in a
number of countries in south central Asia, Bangladesh and
India, and Sub-Saharan Africa, Kenya, and Rwanda (UN,
1997c). Other important regional declines in fertility also took
place in Brazil, the former Soviet republics, and the newly

"fertility assumption causes the projection to decline and to
“hit” the World Bank and UN curves in 2100. This “overshoot”
occurs because the ITASA central scenario assumptions rely on
an expert poll conducted in 1993 (Lutz, 1994), whereas other
projections incorporate more recent information into their
fulure assumptions (more rapid recent fertility declines in
many developing countries; see Courbage, 1998). However,
among demographers disagreement persists on the timing and
rates of demographic transition in the developing countries, in
particular between the demographers at ITASA and those at the
UN and World Bank (see the discussion in Lutz, 1994) on the
differences among alternative population projections). This
disagreement reflects important uncertainties in the projection
of future demographic developments. The below-replacement,
long-term fertility level in the ITASA central estimate is a
hallmark of the institute’s work. Demographers at NASA
strongly adhere to the view that there is little reason to expect
developed nations to return to replacement-level fertility, while
much evidence suggests that low long-term rates will persist
(Lutz et al., 1996). One issue here, however, is that the TFR
measure is currently depressed in Europe, in part because
women are delaying their childbearing until later ages
(Bongaarts, 1998). Thus, the TFR may rise if these women do
have children, and such a correction has to be incorporated into
the long-term TFR assumptions (e.g., see Courbage, 1998).
Important uncertainties are by how fast and how much the TFR
will rise.

"In the recently published ASA population projections (Lutz,

different to those of the UN projections. Within IIASA the
main scenarios are labeled “central,” “rapid transition,” “slow
transition,” “high,” and “low.” In the two “transition” scenarios,
mortality rates and fertility rates are correlated so that low or
high mortality accompanies low or high fertility, respectively,
in line with conventional wisdom among demographers that
fertility declines are associated with mortality declines. This
correlation narrows the range of projected population size as
compared with an anticorrelation assumption. The “high” and
“low” scenarios, by contrast, anticorrelate mortality and
fertility and are considered quite unlikely.

of demographic experts who were asked to give a range of rates
for each region that they considered to cover the 90"" percentile
probability range. Given the Gaussian curve fits to the expert

scenarios, with five-year timesteps, which have a probability
distribution attached to them. The branch points in the fertility,

growth rates (and concomitant aging) might have a beneficial
effect on the economy through reduced youth dependency
ratios, which result in higher savings rates (Higgins and

cause the elderly dependency ratio to increase, which might
lead to a trend of lower savings, characteristic of elderly
cohorts, which have a reduced incentive to save. In terms of
public savings, without institutional reforms aging could
eventually lead to severe strains on social security and health
care programs supported by governments and thus to reduced
governmental savings (US Council of Economic Advisors,

"Interestingly, a case has been made that aging may have
significant impacts on future CO, emissions. The suggested
mechanism for this relates to houschold formation rate
(MacKellar et a/., 1995). An aging population has a greater
proportion of people in older age groups. Assuming age-
specific household formation rates remain constant over time,
as more people enter the older age cohorts the overall
household formation rates will increase. This increase will be
accompanied by a decline in the number of people per
household (a process already observed in industrialized
countries) and is related to reduced fertility rates. As small
households consume significantly more energy per person than
large households (Ironmonger et al., 1995), the various effects
suggest CO, emissions will increase with increased aging
(MacKellar et ai., 1995). Important uncertainties of this effect
remain, not least because household formation rates of aging
populations are not well understood.

"Within the caveats in Section 3.1, a number of demographic
studies show that population change does exert a strong first-
order scaling effect on CO, emissions models (O’Neill, 1996;
Gaffin and O’Neill, 1997; O’Neill et al., 2000; Wexler, 1996).
These studies support the notion that population growth and
the policies that affect it are key factors for future emissions.
Balanced against this, however, are other studies that take a
more skeptical view (Kolsrud and Torrey, 1992; Birdsall, 1994;
Preston, 1996). A full review of model results that address this
question is given in O’Neill (1996) and Gaffin and O’Neill
(1997) and is not be reproduced here because of space
limitations (for a review see Gaffin, 1998). In essence, the
controversy is one of the relationships between population
growth and economic development, as well as other salient
factors that influence emissions. These relationships were first
discussed within the context of IPCC emissions scenarios by
Alcamo et al. (1995) and are discussed in more detail in the

increased knowledge of, access to, and use of birth control, and
accordingly families shift their reproductive behavior to lower
fertility rates. Accompanying this basic premise is a host of
complex social changes, including increased opportunities for
education, employment, and non-maternal roles for women.

first-order relationship not used in previous population variants
and, in particular, not a feature of the UN variants. The two
IIASA variants also represent well the uncertainty range as
spanned by the probabilistic projections of Lutz et al. (1997),
which represent an important methodological advance in the
field. As shown in Figure 3-2, the resultant ASA population
range falls within the range of the UN projections.

"This income effect is primarily interpreted with respect to
fertility changes in currently developing countries. In currently
industrial countries, any change of fertility in response to
increasing wealth is likely to be different from and probably
even opposite to that of developing countries’ fertility. Indeed,
there is evidence of this in Eastern Europe, Sweden, Russia, and
(recently) the United States (UN, 1997a), and it is linked to the
question of long-term fertility rates in industrial countries (see
Section 3.2.3.2.). However, it is evident that future world
population levels will be dominated by growth in developing
countries. Thus, if it is accepted that fertility is lower with
greater affluence, then in emissions scenarios lower populations
will still tend to correlate with higher per capita incomes.

countries were found to be tied to timing and pace of their
demographic transition. Patterns of the range of per capita
GDP growth rates for developing countries available in the

relationship. Growth trends for the period 2020-2050 are
generally higher than those for earlier or later periods; it is in

"Economic and social development comprises many dimensions
and a number of indicators have been devised to assess
progress and setbacks in human development (see Box 3-1).
The UN defines development as the furthering of human
choices. Such choices are neither finite nor static, Yet,
regardless of the level of development, the three essential
choices are to have access to the resources needed for a decent
standard of living, to lead a long and healthy life, and to
acquire knowledge (UNDP, 1997). Other valued choices range
from political, economic, and social freedom to opportunities
for being creative and productive, and to enjoy human rights

"The literature suggests a general inverse correlation between
economic growth rates and population growth rates. Higher
economic growth rates in developing countries should correlate
with lower population growth rates in long-term scenarios and
vice versa, because of the importance of economic
development in bringing about the demographic fertility
transition, This represents a distinctive change from the IS92
trajectories. Importantly, there is still no quantitative basis for
associating any particular economic growth curve with a
particular population curve; this is a qualitative negative
correlation only. Even more important is that income is not
necessarily the best predictor of future fertility rates and many
countries are currently moving through the demographic
transition without a clear economic cause. Alternatively, some
countries have failed to begin a fertility decline even though
economic and social conditions have improved (e.g., Sathar
and Casterline, 1998).

"Writing 220 years ago in The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith noted that: “whatever the soil, climate, or extent of territory of
any particular nation, the abundance or scantiness of its annual output fundamentally depends on its human resources ~ the skill,
dexterity, and judgement of its labour” (Smith, 1970). Although economists recognized the importance of land, labor, and
capital in explaining economic growth and national wealth, in the post-World War II period national well-being has usually been
measured by GDP or gross national product (GNP). GDP is defined as the monetary equivalent of all products and services
generated in a given economy in a given year. GNP equals GDP plus the net balance of international payments to and from that
economy. Few questions were asked about the underlying resource base for GDP growth and whether or not it was sustainable.
Further, since GDP does not reflect all economic transactions it does not provide a full measure of human well-being.
Nevertheless, GDP is very widely used because it is universally accepted as the monetary indicator of all products and services
generated in a given economy within a given year.
"	Text
"More recently, several new approaches have been developed to address the inherent shortcomings of GDP measures. These
include “green” national accounts that incorporate the role of the stocks and flows of renewable and non-renewable resources,
and the related concept of genuine savings (UN, 1993). “Green” GDP is the informal name given to national income measures
that are adjusted for the depletion of natural resources and degradation of the environment. The types of adjustment made to
standard GDP include a measure of the user costs of exploiting natural resources and a value for the social costs of pollution
emissions. In terms of measuring the sustainability of development, the green accounting aggregate with the most policy
relevance is “genuine saving.” This represents the value of the net change in assets that are important for development —
produced assets, natural resources, environmental quality, foreign assets, and human resources, which include retums to
education and raw labor and the strength and scope of social institutions. Human resources tum out, not unexpectedly, to be the
dominant form of wealth in the majority of countries (World Bank, 1997a).
"	Text
"A further problem arises in international comparisons, in which economic indicators are converted from local currencies into a
common currency, such as dollars. Traditionally, market exchange rates are used to make these conversions. In theory, exchange rates
adjust so that the local currency prices of a group of identical goods and services represent equivalent value in every nation. In
practice, such adjustments can lag far behind changing economic circumstances. Policies, such as currency controls, may further
distort the accuracy of market-based rates. Moreover, many goods and services are not traded internationally so market-based
exchange rates may not reflect the relative values of such goods and services, even in theory. An alternative approach is based on
estimates of the purchasing power of different currencies. The International Comparison Project compared prices for several hundred
goods and services in a large number of countries. On the basis of this comparison, the relative values of local currencies are adjusted
to reflect PPP (see UNDP, 1993). In effect, the PPP currency values reflect the number of units of a country’s currency required to
buy the same quantity of comparable goods and services in the local market as one US dollar would buy in an “average” country.
The average country is based on a composite of all participating countries. In 1996 the World Bank initiated the ranking of countries
by GDP converted at PPP rates; the effect was to reduce the income spread between the poorest and richest countries (WRI, 1997a).

stock variables such as the size of the capital stock in an
economy. GDP and GNP relate only to goods and services that
are subject to market transactions, that is only those activities
that are part of the formal economy. Subsistence and other
“gray” economic activities and socially important obligatory
activities, such as childcare or household work, are not

"Income is not an end in itself, but a way to enable human
choices, or to foreclose them in the case of poverty. Therefore,
levels of per capita income (GDP or GNP) have been widely
used as a measure of the degree of economic development, as
in many instances such levels correlate closely (as lead or lag
indicator) with other indicators and dimensions of social
development, such as mortality, nutrition, and access to basic
services, etc. Average income values also do not indicate the
distribution of income, which is an important quantity.
Composite measures, such as the UN Human Development
Index, are also used in historical analyses (see Box 3-1), Note,
however, that the overall nature of scenario results may not
vary much even if some other measure could be used, because
often-used components, such as literacy rates, are generally
correlated with income levels.

"By and large, growth rates are lower for economies at the
technology and productivity frontier, compared to those
approaching it. For instance, in the 19"" century productivity
and per capita GDP growth in the rapidly industrializing US far
exceeded those of England, then at the technology and
productivity frontier. Likewise, in the post-World War II period
growth rates in Japan and most of Western Europe exceeded
those of the US (by then at the technology and productivity

(education), a favorable institutional environment, free trade,
and access to technology are acknowledged as key factors for
rapid economic catch-up (see Section 3.3.4). Likewise,
entrenchment in progressively outdated capital and technology
vintages acts as a retarding force against growth (Frankel,

"Historically, economic growth has been concentrated in
Europe, the Americas, and Australasia. Sustained high-
productivity growth (per capita GDP growth) resulted in the
current high levels of per capita income in the OECD
countries. Latecomers (such as Austria, Japan, Scandinavia)
rapidly caught up to the productivity frontier of the other
OECD economies (most notably that of the US) in the post-
World War II period. Per capita GDP growth rates of 3.5% per
annum were, for instance, achieved in Western Europe between
1950 and 1980. Similarly, high per capita GDP growth rates
were achieved in the developing economies of Asia. Per capita
GDP growth rates of individual countries have even been
higher — 8% per annum in Japan over the period 1950-1973,
7% in Korea between 1965 and 1992, and 6.5% per year in
China since 1980 (Maddison, 1995). Progress in increasing per
capita income levels has been significant in many regions and
countries over the long term, although income gaps in both
absolute and relative terms have not been reduced in the
aggregate. For instance, per capita GDP in Africa is estimated
to have been about 20% of the level of the most affluent OECD
region in 1870; by 1990 this ratio had decreased to 6%

"These economic developments have accompanied the
processes of urbanization, increased access to education,
improved health care, and longer life expectancies. They have
been linked to increasing complexity in economic, legal, and
social institutions (Tainter, 1996). The pattern seen in the six
countries shown in Figure 3-9 is reproduced in most parts of
the world. In general, increasing income per capita is
associated with a shift in production patterns, first from
agriculture to industry, and then more gradually away from
industry into services. Succession processes beneath these
macro-level changes are important. Industrial sectors and
technologies have risen and fallen in importance over the past
few centuries. These processes and analysts’ various attempts
to find patterns to describe them are further discussed in
Section 3.3.4.

"Unlike population projections, no long-term economic~
development scenarios are available in the literature (for an
earlier review, see Jefferson, 1983). In fact, for economic
projections “long term” means time horizons of up to a decade
(e.g., World Bank, 1997b), 1998b, far too short for the time
frame addressed in this report. The longest time frames for
economic growth projections available in the literature extend
to 2015 (e.g., Maddison, 1998) and 2020 (World Bank, 1997b).
The need for long-term economic growth scenarios has arisen
primarily in connection with long-term energy and
environmental impact analyses. Earlier reviews on the related
economic growth assumptions are contained in Nordhaus and
Yohe (1983), Keepin (1986), Griibler (1994), and Alcamo et al.
(1995). An expert poll on uncertainty in future GDP growth
projections is reported in Manne and Richels (1994). Recent
scenario assumptions are reviewed in Chapter 2 above.
"	Text
"Overall, uncertainty concerning productivity and hence per
capita GDP growth is considerable. Uncertainties in
productivity growth rates become amplified because even
small differences in productivity growth rates in all scenarios,
when compounded over a time frame of a century or more into
the future, translate into enormous differences in absolute
levels of per capita GDP. For instance, in the scenarios
reviewed in Alcamo et al. (1995) and Griibler (1994) per capita
GDP growth rates range typically between 0.8 and 2.8% per
year over the period 1990-2100. On the basis of an average
global per capita income of US$4000 in 1990, global per capita
GDP could range anywhere between about US$10,000 to about
US$83,000 by 2100. Such uncertainties are amplified even
more when regional disaggregations are considered, in
particular future productivity growth in developing countries.
The range of views spans all the extremes between developing
countries that lag perennially behind current income levels in
the OECD, to scenarios in which they catch up.

the future could unfold, ranging from SRES low (all-min) to
SRES high (all-max) rates. Extreme scenarios of productivity
growth or lack of growth have not been explored because the
SRES terms of reference cover a qualified range from the
literature; methodological (and model) pluralism is mandatory
(extreme scenarios can be reflected across a wide range of
modeling approaches only to a limited degree). Furthermore,
it 1s not possible to treat uncertainties of future demographic,
economic, and technological developments as independent.
This is shown by the conclusions of recent scenario evaluation
exercises (Alcamo et al., 1995) as well as by theoretical and
empirical evidence (e.g. Abramovitz, 1993; Barro, 1997).
Thus, contrary to the previous IPCC IS92 scenario series (that
varied salient scenario driving forces independently of each
other), the SRES scenarios attempt to incorporate advances in
the understanding of the relationships between important
scenario drivers. From this perspective, uncertainties about
future productivity and hence economic growth are not
parametric, but rather are related to the uncertainties in current
understanding and modeling of the interactions between
demographics, productivity growth, and socio-institutional
and technological change. These are addressed in Section

"Economic growth can either be achieved by increasing the
factor inputs to production, such as capital and labor, or by
increasing productivity (i.e., the efficiency by which factors of
production are used to generate economic output). Without
productivity growth, long-run output growth cannot be
maintained with limited or depletable resource inputs; as a
result, complex societies become increasingly vulnerable
(Tainter, 1988). Changes between inputs and outputs are
usually analyzed by drawing upon the production function
approach pioneered by Tinbergen (1942) and Solow (1957).
Yet, empirical analyses (e.g., Denison, 1962, 1985) quickly
identified that quality and composition of factor inputs are
More important in explaining long-run output growth than
merely the quantitative growth in available factor inputs. For
instance, at first sight population growth might be considered
as central for economic growth, because it increases the labor
force. Upon closer examination, however, institutional and
social factors that govern working-time regulation, female
workforce participation, and above all the qualification of the
workforce (education) have been more important determinants
of long-run economic growth (Denison, 1962, 1985) than
simple growth in the numbers of the potential workforce
(usually calculated as the population in the age bracket 15 to 65
years). Another puzzling finding of Solow (1957) is that, even

with population aging all these other important determinants of

to be compensated by corresponding changes in these variables
(e.g. greater female workforce participation, earlier retirement,

significant influence on economic growth rates. Reductions in

First, population aging is not necessarily the best indicator for
workforce availability, because while the percentage of the
elderly, in particular those of retirement age, increases, the
proportion of younger people (of pre-work or -career age)
decreases. As a result, the percentage of the working age
population (age 15 to 65 years) in the total population
changes less dramatically, even in scenarios of pronounced
aging. For instance, in the ITASA low population scenario (7
billion world population by 2100) discussed in Section 3.2,
the percentage of age categories 15 to 65 years changes from
62% in 1995 to 54% by 2100. This percentage falls to 48% in
the regions with the highest population aging (Lutz er al.,
1996).
"	Text
"A second point is that these demographic variables only
indicate potential workforce numbers. Actual gainfully
employed workforce numbers are influenced by additional
important variables — unemployment levels, female workforce
participation rates, and finally working time. The importance
of these variables can be illustrated by a few statistics.
Currently, about 40 million people are unemployed in the
OECD countries (UNDP, 1997). The female workforce
participation ratios vary enormously, from about 10% to 48%
of the workforce (as in Saudi Arabia and Sweden, respectively;
UNDP, 1997), and have been changing dramatically over time.
For the US, for instance, female workforce participation rates
increased from 17% in 1890 (US DOC, 1975) to 45% in 1990
(UNDP, 1997). Similar dramatic long-term changes have
occurred in the number of working hours in all industrial
countries. Compared to the mid-19"" century, the number of
average working hours has declined from about 3000 to about
1500 (Maddison, 1995; Ausubel and Griibler, 1995). However,
in most OECD countries the trend in working time reductions
has slowed to a halt since the early 1980s (Marchand, 1992).

"The importance of “advances in knowledge” and technology in
explaining the historical record of productivity growth is
mentioned above. In the original study by Solow (1957) this
was estimated to account for 87% of per capita productivity
growth (the remainder was attributed to increases in capital
inputs). Since then further methodological and_ statistical
refinements have reduced the unexplained “residual” of
productivity growth that is equated to advances in knowledge
and technology, but it remains the largest single source of long-
run productivity and economic growth. It is estimated to
account for more than one-third of total GDP growth in the
USA since 1929 (Denison, 1985), and for between 34% and
63% of GDP growth in the OECD countries over the period
1947 to 1973 (Barro and Sala-I-Martin, 1995).

"International trade is recognized as an important source of
economic gains, as it enables comparative advantages to be
exploited and the diffusion of new technologies and practices.
Equally important are domestic and international investments.
From an economic perspective, trade reflects gains from
increasing division of labor, and the historical evidence indicates
an associated phenomenal growth. Updated (Griibler, 1998a)
estimates from Rostow (1978) indicate an increase of more than
a thousand-fold in international trade since the beginning of the
19"" century. In 1990, world trade accounted for close to US$3.4
trillion (10!2), or 13% of world GDP. Chenery eg al. (1986) and
Barro (1997) indicate strong empirical evidence of a positive
relationship between trade (“openness” of economies) and terms
of trade (of the economies) on productivity, industrialization,
and economic growth. Dosi et al. (1990) highlight also the
critical roles of policies and institutions in the relative success or
failure of realizing economic gains from the international
division of labor. Finally, openness to trade could have negative
economic impacts on countries that experience a deterioration of

"Globalization is an increasingly popular term for an ill-defined
collection of processes. The most important of these processes
appear to be the liberalization of markets for goods, services,
and capital, and the increasing flow of information and capital
around the world. According to the neoclassic model.
globalization should benefit everyone; it helps industry in all
countries to move closer to the productivity frontier and gives
consumers access to a wider choice of goods and services at
lower prices. In practice, of course, the world is more
complicated than is assumed in the neoclassic model.
Economists such as Dosi et al. (1990) and Grossman and
Helpman (1991) have experimented with alternative models,
and shown that some countries may not benefit from free trade
or from freely available information. Huntington (1996)
observes that by “globalization,” Americans and Europeans
often mean “westerization” in the sense of global adoption of
western social and cultural norms. This process of cultural
convergence is a source of great concern in many parts of the
world. However, Huntington suggests that economic
globalization may be possible without cultural globalization.

"The observed slowdown in productivity growth rates since the
carly 1970s is generally interpreted as a weakening of the
technological frontier in the OECD countries (Maddison,
1995; Barro, 1997), although quantitative statistics (and even
everyday experience) do not corroborate the perception of a
slowdown in technological innovation and change. An
alternative interpretation of slower recent productivity growth
is that the OECD countries have moved out of a long period of
industrialization and into post-industrial development as
service economies. In such economies, productivity is
extremely hard to measure, partly because services comprise a
mixture of government, non-market, and market activities,
partly because economic accounts measure services primarily
via inputs (e.g. cost of labor) rather than outputs, and partly
because it is difficult to define service quality, Nevertheless,
labor productivity in the service sector appears to grow more
slowly than that in the agricultural and industrial sectors
(Millward, 1990; Baumol, 1993). The traditional concept of
labor productivity may need revision to be applied usefully to
the service economy.

"productivity growth rates and hence to conditional
convergence across different economies. Rostow (1990)
coined the term that the “poor get richer and the rich slow
down.” The convergence theorem of neoclassic theory arises
from diminishing retums on capital. Economies that tend to
have less capital per worker tend to have higher rates of return
and hence higher growth rates (see Abramovitz, 1986).
Conversely, economies with high capital intensity (which,
because of the relationship between capital intensity and
productivity, are closer to or at the productivity frontier) tend
to have lower growth rates, Evidently, economies differ in
more respects than their capital intensities, and hence even
neoclassic theory only postulates conditional convergence
(after accounting for all other factors).

"Work at IIASA (e.g., Hafele et al., 1982; Griibler and
Naki¢enovié, 1991; Nakicenovicé, 1996; Griibler et al., 1993b;
Griibler, 1998a) sought to identify regularities in the market
succession of technology in energy supply, transport, and the
iron and steel industry. In fact, there may be a close parallel
between the waves of technology they observe and
Kondratiev’s economic long waves. However, both empirical
and theoretical implications of “long waves” remain unclear
(see the review in Freeman, 1996; and especially Rosenberg
and Frischtak, 1984). Equally, no approach can hope to foresee
reliably the form of the next “wave.” It is possible that solar
energy and nuclear power might play a strong role, perhaps
combined with hydrogen as an energy carrier, as suggested by
Hafele e¢ al. (1982) and others. The next wave in transport
technology might well be an increasing share for aviation and
high speed rail (Griibler and Nakiéenovié, 1991), a transition to
0.5 litre/100 km “hypercars” (Lovins e7 al., 1993), or a radical
change in urban planning to minimize transport needs
(Newman and Kenworthy, 1990). These possibilities highlight
in particular the need for technology diffusion to avoid
technological “lock-in” to older technological vintages (Parikh
et al., 1997).

"The neoclassic concept of capital is usefully extended to
include also human capital in the form of education,
experience, and health (see, e.g., Lucas, 1988; Barro and Sala-
{-Martin, 1995). Thus, additional convergence potentials
accrue for economies with a proportionally higher ratio of
human-to-physical capital. Equally, the generation and
adoption of new technologies is facilitated by high human
capital. Yet, even with the inclusion of human capital, long-
term per capita growth must eventually cease in the absence of
continuous improvements in technology. This cessation,
however, mostly affects economies at the productivity frontier
and not those that lag behind. For the latter, both theory and
empirical evidence seem, all else being equal, to indicate
conditional convergence (i.¢., “the poor can get richer.”). The
ceteris paribus condition is an important qualifier for the
convergence theorem, Evidently, the potential for conditional
convergence and economic catch-up cannot be realized in an
economy struck by civil war, poor institutions, or even low
savings rates (related to the demographic transition discussed
in Section 3.2), The recent Asian financial crisis also
demonstrated that differential capital productivity indeed can
lead to vast influxes of capital into developing economies, and
appropriate assimilative capacities (banking systems,
functioning legal system, institutions, etc.) need to be in place
to use such capital flows productively (World Bank, 1998b).
"	Text
"Finally, another interpretation is that productivity growth lags
behind technological change, because appropriate institutional
and social adjustment processes take considerable time to be
implemented (Freeman and Perez, 1988; David, 1990). Once
an appropriate “match” (Freeman and Perez, 1988) between
institutional and technological change is achieved, productivity
growth could accelerate. Maddison (1995) observes that the
19"" century productivity surge in the USA was preceded by a
long period of investment in infrastructure. Landes (1969)
notes that both the German and Japanese economic
acceleration was preceded by a long period of investment in
education. Maddison (1995) further suggests that recent
developments in information technology involve considerable
investment, both in hardware and in human learning, which
may result in higher efficiency improvements and productivity
gains in the future only. This perspective is consistent with the
possible emergence of a new “techno-economic paradigm” or
“Kondratiev wave.” This complementary theory of long-term
economic development focuses on the interplay and
interrelationships between institutional and technological
change. Following Kondratiev’s (1926) observation of “long
waves” in the American economy, Schumpeter (1935)
developed a theory to explain these waves on the basis of
discontinuities in entrepreneurial innovations. Freeman (1990)
emphasizes Schumpeter’s view that long waves are not so
much evident in economic statistics as in qualitative features of
the economy. Freeman and Perez (1988) describe five
historical waves of technical and economic change and identify
associated economic booms and recessions (successive
“techno-economic paradigms”).

factors set favorably) for a poor economy to catch-up to levels
that prevail in the industrial countries today, never mind the
levels that might prevail in affluent countries 100 years in the
future. Barro’s analysis indicates a threshold GDP per capita
level at approximately US$3000 per year. Below that level,
additional productivity growth potentials result from catch-up:
beyond that level, higher per capita GDP levels make further
productivity growth ever more difficult to achieve (as indicated

"Given the wide range in historical experiences and the slow
rates of convergence suggested by neoclassic growth theory, it
is not surprising that the available scenario literature takes a
cautious view on economic catch-up. Whereas convergence
tendencies are generally evident in scenario assumptions (see
the significantly higher GDP per capita growth rates for
currently developing countries compared to industrial
countries in Figure 3-10), long-term convergence rates are low.
For instance, from all six IS92 scenarios only one (1892e)
assumes that developing countries outside China may
eventually reach present OECD income levels, and even in this
Most optimistic scenario it is assumed to occur only after 2080

referred to the IS92 scenario series as being “unfair to the
South,” a point also taken up in the evaluation of the [S92
scenarios. Alcamo ef al. (1995) concluded that new IPCC
scenarios “will be needed for exploring a wide variety of
economic development pathways, for example, a closing of the
income gap between industrial and developing countries.” With
a few notable exceptions (e.g., the scenario developed by
Lazarus et al. (1993) and the Case C scenarios presented in
WASA-World Energy Conference (WEC) (IIASA-WEC,
1995) and Nakicenovié ef a/. (1998a)), the challenge to explore
conditions and pathways that close the income gap between
developing and industrial regions appears to have been
insufficiently taken up in the scenario literature, a gap this
report aims to begin to fill. Chapter 4 describes two scenarios
in which the ratios between regions of GDP/capita decline and
the absolute differences increase.

"Evidence suggests that the physical input of energy or
materials per unit of monetary output (materials or energy
intensity) follows an inverted U-curve (IU hypothesis) as a
function of income. For some materials the [U-hypothesis
(Moll, 1989; Tilton, 1990) holds quite well. The underlying
explanatory factors are a mixture of structural change in the
economy along with technology and resource substitution and
innovation processes. Recent literature illustrates material
consumption that rises faster than GDP in well-developed
countries in a relationship better described as N-shaped (de
Bruyn and Opschoor, 1994; de Bruyn, et al., 1995; Suri and
Chapman, 1996; Ansuategi et a/., 1997). A similar IU curve is
observed for modern, commercial energy forms (Darmstadter
et al., 1977; Goldemberg et al., 1988; Martin, 1988;
HASA-—WEC, 1995; Watson et al., 1996; Judson et al., 1999),
although the initially rising part of commercial energy
intensity stems from the substitution of traditional (inefficient)
energy forms and technologies by modern commercial energy
forms (see also the discussion of the “environmental Kuznets
curve” for traditional air pollutants in Section 3.1, also an
inverted U-shaped curve). The resultant aggregate total
(commercial plus non-commercial) energy intensity shows a
persistent declining trend over time, especially with rising
incomes (Watson et al., 1996; Nakiéenovié et al., 1998a).
Empirical evidence thus suggests that, all else being equal,
energy and materials intensities are closely related to overall
macroeconomic productivity. In other words, higher
productivity (GDP per capita) is associated with lower energy
and materials intensity (lower use of energy and materials per
unit of GDP).

"Two final caveats are important. First, growth in productivity
and intensity improvement growth have historically been
outpaced by economic output growth. Hence, materials and
energy use has risen in absolute terms (see Nriagu, 1996;
Watson et al., 1996; Griibler, 1998a). The second caveat is that
energy and material intensity are affected by many factors
other than macroeconomic productivity growth and resultant
income. OECD (1998b) notes that high rates of productivity
increase have been associated in the past with new competitive
pressures, strong price or regulatory incentives, catching up or
recovery, and a good “climate for innovation.” Also, the
emergence of new technologies and resource—strategic

productivity growth rates will diffuse nationally, regionally,

"The most important conclusion to retain from Figures 3-12 and
3-13 is that energy and materials intensity (i.e. energy use per
unit of economic output) tend to decline with rising levels of
GDP per capita. Thus, energy and material productivity — the
inverse of energy intensity — improve in line with overall
macroeconomic productivity (as represented, e.g., by GDP per
capita levels). Also, they tend to deteriorate when productivity
levels fall, as happened during the start of the deep economic
recession in Central and Eastern Europe (Government of
Russian Federation, 1995). A corollary of this relationship is
that material and energy intensities decline the faster per capita
income grows. Thus, overall economic productivity growth
(GDP per capita growth) and reductions in materials and
energy use per unit GDP (materials and energy productivity
growth) are closely related. The fundamental reason is that
high macroeconomic growth presupposes accelerated rates of
technical change and corresponds with a fast turnover of
capital stock and, hence, a faster incorporation in the economy.
This represents an important new finding for long-term energy
and emissions scenarios that have, to date, Jargely treated
economic and resource productivity growth as independent of

"For instance, low historical rates of energy intensity
improvement reflect the low priority placed on energy
efficiency by most producers and users of technology. On
average energy costs account for only about 5% of GDP. Energy
intensity reductions average about 1% per year, in contrast to
improvements in labor productivity above 2% per year over the
period 1870 to1992. Over shorter time periods, and given
appropriate incentives, energy intensity improvement rates can
be substantially higher, as in the OECD countries after 1973 or
in China since 1977, where energy intensity improvement rates
of 5% have been observed. Rapid productivity growth can also
occur during periods of successful economic catch-up; for
instance, Japanese labor productivity grew at 7.7% annually
during 1950-1973 (Maddison, 1995). Similar high-productivity
growths were also achieved in industrial oi! usage in the OECD
or US car fuel economies after 1973. Of the examples given in
Table 3-3, productivity increases are the highest for
communication. Not surprisingly, many observers consider that
given a continuation of historical trends communication may
become a similarly important driver of economic growth in the
future as traditional, resource- and energy-intensive industries
have been in the past.

industrial toward the developing countries ends, long-term
economic output could come from services and other less
energy-intensive activities.
"	Text
"The spatial distribution of the population and its economic
activities is still unclear, which raises the possibility of adopting
urban and/or regional planning. Industrial policies directed at
tural development and strengthening the role of small and
medium cities would reduce the extent of rural exodus and the
degree of demographic concentration in large cities.
"	Text
"Perhaps the most extreme view may be that the
development process is nearing completion in Europe,
North America, and Australasia, so that the main
prospect for growth is through the diffusion of existing
best-practice technologies to the rest of the world.

The nature of economic development may have
changed significantly in high-income countries, with a
new emphasis on services, quality, and information.
"	List
"Moreover, technological choices, both in production and
consumption apparatus, can substantially decrease the energy
demand per GDP. For instance, Chinese households are not
bound to adopt the same model of energy-intensive
refrigerators that have equipped American families. Similarly,
future cement factories in developing countries should not fail
to include up-to-date technological improvements, such as the
dry process.
"	Text
"the likelihood of zero or even negative productivity growth in
the developed countries is low, closure of the development gap
requires accelerated rates of productivity growth and the need
to overcome or avoid setbacks in per capita income growth in
many developing countries. Scenarios that explore this
possibility will necessarily extend beyond the range of futures
spanned by the IS92 scenarios, as well as beyond the range of
the majority of the “conventional wisdom” scenario literature
on the future of developing countries.
"	Text
"Globalization of markets, technologies, and information
networks may help accelerate productivity growth in the
future. However, both economic and social losers could result
from the globalization process. The financial instability during
1998 has cast further doubt on the inevitability of global
convergence as a standard model of political economy. Hence,
a further important dimension of uncertainty to be explored in
the scenarios is the degree of globalization or regionalization in
economic, social, and technological development.
"	Text
"Particular sets of technological and behavioral options can be
clustered into alternative, internally consistent packages to
represent different choices over time and so define different
development paths for any economy. Such clusters can give
rise to self-reinforcing loops between technical choice,
consumer demand, and geographic distribution, which create
“lock-in” effects and foreclosures of options in technology and
socio-institutional innovations. The time-dependent nature of
these choices gives rise to bifurcations and irreversibilities in
which the shift from one development path to another entails
important economic and political costs.
"	Text
"These examples show that developing countries could adopt
anticipative strategies to avoid, in the long-term, the problems
faced today by industrial societies (“leapfrogging”). Such
alternative development patterns highlight the technical
feasibility of emission futures in the developing regions that
can be compatible with national objectives. However, the
barriers to a more sustainable development in the developing
regions can hardly be underestimated, and range from financial
constraints to cultural behaviors (in both industrial and
developing countries), which include the lack of appropriate
institutional structures.
"	Text
"As a major part of the needed infrastructure to meet
development needs still has to be built, the spectrum of future
options is considerably wider in developing than in industrial
countries. For instance, the technical possibilities for low
emission futures in the developing countries are many. The
extent of the spectrum of future options depends on the
changes discussed in Sections 3.2 and 3.3, but also on the
outcome of crucial issues. These include political power
structure, national governance and institutional structure;
income distribution; cultural attitudes and consumption
patterns (diets, housing, etc.), development of and access to
modern technologies (energy, production, distribution, etc.),
and the geographic distribution of activities (land use, urban
settlement, transportation needs, etc.).
"	Text
"The process of economic and social development depends both
on the ability of the current lead countries in productivity to
maintain their technological and institutional creativity, and on
the ability of other countries to adopt leading-edge
technologies and institutions or to develop their own. The
crucial issues of “how much” and “what kind” of productivity
growth can be addressed only by describing alternative
scenarios of future development. To develop alternative
scenarios it is necessary to recall the important qualitative
relationship between demographic transition and social and
economic development. Causality links could be in either
direction, but the importance of the relationship is recognized
in both theoretical and empirical studies. Hence, as
summarized in Section 3.2, this relationship should be
incorporated into the SRES scenarios. Scenarios of accelerated
rates of economic and social development should therefore be
the scenarios with an accelerated demographic transition, This
corresponds to a linking of high per capita development with
comparatively low population levels.

"	Title
"In this section, energy end-uses, resources, and technologies
are reviewed, Their future evolution is of critical importance to
future emissions levels. First, major patterns of energy end-use
and emissions by sector are considered, followed by a
discussion of energy resources; then energy supply
technologies that might become of greater importance in the

"Such development is hard to measure in material terms.
Many writers refer to “dematerialization” and the
emergence of the “knowledge-based” economy.

The start of a new “Kondratiev wave” may be
underway, to be revealed in the early 21 century in a
surge of economic growth, with the massive
development of high-technology industries leading to
new products of increasing value and renewed
opportunities for fast developmental catch-up.
"	List
"Therefore, the task of future scenario development entails more
than just the adoption of alternative quantitative assumptions.
The overall context within which alternative assumptions on
productivity growth or energy and materials intensity take
place needs to be made explicit. This is simply because many
key influencing factors (e.g., institutions) cannot be assessed
quantitatively, or the relationship between factors is known
only qualitatively. The development of alternative qualitative
scenario “storylines” (see Chapter 4) is therefore an important
advance over previous IPCC scenario methodologies.

"Energy intensity is the amount of energy used to perform a
particular service, such as to produce a ton of steel, power a
refrigerator, or propel a vehicle. Technical progress generally
leads to improved energy efficiency in technologies such as
lights, vehicles, refrigerators, and manufacturing processes.
Many studies show that considerable energy efficiency
improvement can be realized (technically and economically) in
the short term (10-15 years) with available technologies
(Szargut and Morris, 1987; Ayres, 1989; Jochem, 1989; Lovins
and Lovins, 1991; Naki¢enovié et al., 1993; WEC, 1995b;

"In 1990, industry accounted for two-fifths of global primary
energy use, residential and commercial buildings for a slightly
smaller amount, and transportation for one-fifth of the total.
These shares vary according to economic structures in each
region (see below). Carbon emissions that result from energy
use depend on the carbon intensity of the energy source.
Changes in carbon intensity mainly result from fuel
substitution, but can also arise from changes in technology or
process. The largest shifts in carbon intensity over the long
term are associated with changes in the energy sources used for
power generation since 1850 (Nakiéenovié and Griibler, 1996).
Smaller but still significant shifts resulted from fuel switching

"Table 3-4 shows that global primary energy use grew from
191 EJ in 1971 to 307 EJ in 1990 at an average annual growth
rate of 2.5% per year. This growth tapered off in all sectors
after 1990, and total global primary energy increased to only
319 EJ by 1995, mainly because of the large declines
experienced in the REF region (see Chapter 1 for definition of
SRES world regions) as a result of the political and economic
restructuring of the countries within it. Table 3-4 shows that
the industrial sector clearly dominates total primary energy
use, followed by the buildings sector (commercial,
residential, and institutional buildings combined), transport
sector, and agriculture sector.
"	Text
"Sectoral energy use and GHG emissions changes are often
discussed in terms of trends in the major end-use sectors (e.g.,
Sathaye et al., 1989; IEA, 1997c; Schipper et al., 1997a; Price
et al., 1998). Trends reveal striking differences between sectors
and regions of the world. The key sectors of the economy that
use energy are industry (including agriculture), commercial,
residential, and institutional buildings, and transportation. Key
drivers of energy use and carbon emissions include activity
drivers (total population growth, urbanization, building, and
vehicle stock, commodity production), economic drivers (total
GDP, income, and price elasticities), energy intensity trends
(energy intensity of energy-using equipment, appliances,
vehicles), and carbon intensity trends. These factors are in turn
driven by changes in consumer preferences, energy and
technology costs, settlement and infrastructure patterns,
technical progress, and overall economic conditions.

"As a result, scenarios can span from low dematerialization to
high dematerialization futures associated with a wide range of
income levels. In the former, the shift toward more value-added
products in industry would be compensated by rising labor
productivity and hence lower product costs. Economic
production remains material oriented, It may be a world with
huge underground cities, air-conditioned tourist resort areas
with indoor beaches, a significant fraction of people in low-
density regions may fly their own airplanes, and robots may do
housework in most homes. In the latter, much of the money
flow would be associated with exchange of information and
services. Industrial value added would be, to a large extent,
generated from R&D and know-how, and less from increasing
productivity in traditional industries. Educational, childcare,
and medical services would make up a large part of personal
expenditures. Already, all kinds of artistic and handicraft work
have become part of the formal monetary economy, partly
because of the booming world tourist industry. Much
“economic growth” may revolve around the (re)distribution of
scarce, positional goods such as space and valuable artworks.

"Energy use in the industrial sector is dominated by the
production of a few major energy-intensive commodities, such
as steel, paper, cement, and chemicals. Rapidly industrializing
countries have higher demands for these infrastructure
materials and more mature markets have declining or stable
levels of consumption. Studies of material consumption in
industrialized countries show increases in the initial
development of society to a maximum consumption level,
which then remains constant or even declines as infrastructure
needs are met and material recycling increases. Absolute and
per capita consumptions of some materials appear to have
reached levels of stabilization in many industrialized countries,
although this is not true of all materials (e.g. paper). Expressed
as a function of unit GDP, material intensity generally declines
after reaching a maximum (Williams e¢ al., 1987; Wernick,
1996; WRI, 1997b; see also Section 3.3). Although the use of
all materials in developing countries will certainly grow, per

some areas of Europe and in the REF region. Space heating is
not common in most developing countries, with the exception
of China, South Korea, South Africa, Argentina, and a few
other South American countries (Sathaye et al., 1989).
Residential space-heating energy intensities declined in most
industrial countries (except Japan) between 1970 and 1992
because of reduced heat losses in buildings, lowered indoor
temperatures, more careful heating practices, and
improvements in efficiency of heating equipment (Schipper et
al., 1996; IEA, 1997c). Water heating, refrigeration, space
cooling, and lighting are the next largest residential energy
uses, respectively, in most industrialized countries (IEA,
1997c). In developing countries, cooking and water heating
dominate, followed by lighting, small appliances, and
refrigerators (Sathaye and Ketoff, 1991). Appliance
penetration rates increased in all regions between 1970 and
1990. The energy intensity of new appliances has declined over
the past two decades — new refrigerators in the US were 65%
less energy-intensive in 1993 than in 1972 (Schipper et al.,
1996).

"The term energy resource can be defined as “the occurrence of
material in recognizable form” (WEC, 1995a) — it is
essentially the amount of oil, gas, coal, etc., in the ground. In
the IPCC WGII SAR (energy primer, see Nakiéenovié et al.,
1996) a further definitional distinction was made. Resources
were defined as those occurrences considered “potentially
recoverable with foreseeable technological and economic
developments” and any additional amounts not considered as
potentially recoverable were referred to as “occurrences.” An
energy reserve is a portion of the total, and depends on
exploration to locate and evaluate a resource and on the
availability of a technology to extract some of the resource at
acceptable cost. Proved oil reserves, for example, are defined
as “those quantities which geological and engineering
information indicates with reasonable certainty can be
recovered in the future from known reservoirs under existing
economic and operating conditions” (BP, 1996). Thus,
reserves can increase with exploration (new or better
information), engineering advances (better economic and
operating conditions), and higher prices (better economic
conditions). In essence, reserves are “replenished” by shifting
volumes from the resource into the reserve category. Reserves
can also be depleted through production and can decrease with
lower prices. Throughout this section the size of reserve and
resource figures are expressed in EJ or ZJ (i.e. 10?! J, or 1000

reserves (WEC, 1995a; [998), over 200 times current

additional resources can be upgraded to reserves. WEC (1995a;

although it is not clear under what conditions these reserves

known to exist in various countries, some of which might be
exploitable in the future, perhaps at high cost. However, in
some countries the environmental damage from coal mining
will prevent possible additional reserves being developed. In
the IPCC WGII SAR, Nakiéenovié et a/ (1996) estimate that,

"Estimates of ultimately recoverable reserves of gas are less
controversial than those for oil. Proved reserves are high, both
in relation to current production (BP, 1996) and to cumulative
production to date (Masters et al., 1994). Masters er al. (1994)
and Ivanhoe and Leckie (1993) note that gas discoveries need
to be matched to an infrastructure for gas consumption, which
is currently lacking in many parts of the world. Hence,
exploration has been limited and the potential for discoveries
of major quantities of gas in the 21‘ century is high. Estimates
of gas reserves and resources are being revised continuously.
The most up-to-date information is represented by the figures
of the International Gas Union (IGU, 1997a), which give
conventional gas reserves of 5.4 ZJ plus 9.4 ZJ additional
reserves, including gas yet to be discovered. On the basis of
1GU comments that some of their regional estimates of
reserves are extremely conservative, Gregory and Rogner
(1998) suggest an optimistic estimate for ultimately
recoverable reserves of 28 ZJ (5.4 ZJ reserves plus 22.6 ZJ
additional reserves, including quantitics to be discovered),
using the same ratio of optimistic to pessimistic reserves as
Masters et al. (1994).

"In addition to conventional reserves, reviews of the literature
indicate very substantial amounts of unconventional gas
occurrences. Rogner (1996, 1997) estimated resources in place
for coal-bed methane (CH,) of 10 ZJ, gas from fractured shale
of 17 ZJ, tight formation gas of 7 ZJ, gas remaining in situ after
production of 5 ZJ, and clathrates at some 980 ZJ. The
magnitude of these estimates is also confirmed in IPCC WGII
SAR (Nakicenovié et al., 1996), which gives 6.9 ZJ
unconventional gas as current reserves, and an additional 20 ZJ
as recoverable with current or foreseeable improvements in
technologies. The largest resource occurrence of all fossil fuels
(even exceeding coal) is estimated to be methane clathrates.
Also called hydrates, methane clathrates represent gas locked
in frozen ice-like crystals that probably cover a significant
proportion of the ocean floor and have been found in numerous
locations in continental permafrost areas. Technologies to
recover these resources economically could be developed in
the future, if demand for natural gas continues to grow in the
longer run, in which case gas resource availability would
increase enormously. The implications of such developments
are considered in some of the SRES scenarios.

"The picture for uranium and thorium reserves is different
again. Current proved uranium reserves recoverable at less
than US$130/kg amount to some 3.38 million tons (WEC,
1998) or 2 ZJ in once-through fuel cycles. This extractable
thermal energy would be some 60 times larger if reprocessing
and fast breeder reactors are used (Ishitani and Johansson,
1996). These reserves are sufficient to meet the needs of an
expanded nuclear program well into the 21% century, even
without reprocessing and fast breeder reactors. The
ultimately recoverable global natural uranium resource base
is currently estimated at around 29 million tons, which
corresponds to 17 ZJ without reprocessing and about 1000 ZJ
with reprocessing and fast breeder reactors (Naki¢enovié et
al., 1996). Additionally, very limited exploration for new
reserves has occurred in recent years because of the relative
abundance of existing known reserves and the drop of real
uranium prices from US$150/kg in 1980 to about US$30/kg
in 1996. The exploration and development of uranium
deposits today is probably on a par with that of the oil
industry 100 years ago, while thorium occurrences have
hardly been assessed. Uranium and thorium are minerals
contained in deposits in the Earth’s crust and their long-term
availability will be determined by the same process
dynamics, in terms of knowledge and technology advances,
as for their hydrocarbon counterparts. Once new reserves are
required, given the comparison with the oil industry over the
past 100 years, the potential for exploration to yield major
discoveries at acceptable cost is enormous. From the
perspective of occurrence alone, uranium resources are
already known to be immense, especially if low-
concentration sources such as seawater or granite rock are
considered. In summary, the development of nuclear power
throughout the 21* century, even based only on once-through
reactors, is unlikely to be constrained by uranium (or
thorium) resource limitations.

The literature suggests that models of endogenous

methodologies are established that reduce the substantial
uncertainties with respect to direction and rates of change of
future technology developments. Differences in opinions as to
the likelihood and dynamics of change in future technologies
will therefore persist. Such future uncertainties are best
captured by adopting a scenario approach. The following
discussion on changes in energy supply and end-use
technologies therefore reviews the literature with emphasis on
empirically observed historical and conjectured future
changes. The principal message is that while the future is
uncertain, the certainty is that future technologies will be
different from those used today. Hence the most unlikely
scenario of future development is that of stagnation, or absence

"Possu-lueled power stations traditionally have been designed
around steam turbines to convert heat into electricity.
Conversion efficiencies of new power stations can exceed 40%
(on a lower heating value basis — when the latent heat of steam
from water in the fuel or the steam arising from the hydrogen
content of the fuel has been excluded). New designs, such as
supercritical designs that involve new materials to allow higher
steam temperatures and pressures, enable efficiencies of close
to 50%. In the long run, further improvements might be
expected. However, the past decade or so has seen the dramatic
breakthrough of combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs). The
technology involves expanding very hot combustion gases
through a gas turbine with the waste heat in the exhaust gases
used to generate steam for a steam turbine. The gas turbine can
withstand much higher inlet temperatures than a steam turbine,
which produces considerable increases in overall efficiency.
The latest designs currently under construction can achieve
efficiencies of over 60%, a figure that has been rising by over
1% per year for a decade, The low capital costs and high
availability of CCGTs also make them highly desirable to
power station operators. Gregory and Rogner (1998) estimate
that maximum efficiencies of 71 to 73% are achievable within
a reasonable period (on a lower heating basis; around 65 to
68% on a higher heating basis).

"A critical issue in the context of this report is how to capture
alternative future interplays between energy technology and
resource development, in contrast to the more traditional
approach of assuming fixed resource quantities across all
scenarios. This is important because the literature reviewed
above indicates that resource availability can vary widely. For
instance, generally oil and gas are considered the most
constrained fossil fuel resources. Yet, a representative range
from the literature gives cumulative production levels between
1990 and 2100 of between 21 and 65 ZJ, with typical
intermediate scenarios of 30-35 ZJ (Nakicenovié et al., 1998a;
Schollenberger, 1998). The extreme values of cumulative
resource use are evidently inversely related between different
energy sources across the range of alternative scenarios. For
instance, in scenarios with high availability of oil and gas,
typically the use of coal or renewable resources is more limited,
whereas in scenarios of rapid development of renewable
alternatives, the use of fossil resources is more limited. In other
words, future resource availability of fossil fuels as well as
renewables is constructed in scenarios based on current
understanding and the available literature. Resource availability
results from alternative policies and strategies in exploration,
R&D, investments, and the resultant resource development
efforts. The long lead-times and enormous investments involved
result in such strategies yielding a cumulative effect, referred to
in the technological literature as “lock-in” (see Section 3.4.4).
Development of alternatives can be furthered, but it can also be
blocked when policies and investments favor existing resources
and technologies. The most important long-term issue is how the
transition away from easily accessible conventional oil (and to a
lesser extent conventional gas) reserves will unfold. Will it lead
to a massive development of coal in the absence of alternatives
or, conversely, to a massive development of unconventional oil
and gas? Alternatively, could the development of post-fossil
alternatives make the recourse to coal and unconventional oil
and gas (such as methane clathrates) obsolete?

contrast to other fossil-sourced electricity generation, fuel cells
(similar to batteries) convert the chemical energy of fuels
electrochemically (i.e., without combustion) into electricity

efficiencies than internal combustion engines. In the past, high
costs and durability problems have restricted their use to some
highly specialized applications, such as electricity generation

"Although operating internally on hydrogen, fuel cells can be
fueled with a hydrocarbon fuel, such as natural gas, methanol,
gasoline, or even coal. Before entering the fuel cells, these
fuels would be converted on-site or on-board into hydrogen via
steam reforming, partial oxidation, or gasification and
hydrogen separation. In the longer run and to make fuel cells
truly zero-emission devices, non-fossil derived pure hydrogen,
supplied and stored as compressed gas, cryogenic liquid, metal
hydrate, or other storage form, could replace hydrocarbon
fuels. Current fuel cell conversion efficiencies (45 to 50%)
have yet to approach their potentials; some designs report
efficiencies as high as 60% electrical efficiency in simple
systems and 74% total efficiency in hybrid fuel cell and gas
combined cycle systems (FETC, 1997). Hydrogen production

"Biomass, particularly wood, has been the main initial source of
energy as countries develop and remains a substantial energy
source in many developing countries (WEC, 1994). In addition
to this, byproducts of agriculture and forestry can be useful
sources of energy. The extent to which biomass can contribute
beyond this to provide energy crops for use in, say, power
stations or for conversion into liquid fuels depends firstly on
the competition for land with agriculture for food production.
This, in turn, depends on improved productivity in food
production, the amount and type of meat and other animal
(e.g., dairy) products in the diet, and the growth in human
population. The future contribution of biomass will also
depend on increased productivity in biomass production
coupled with limitations in energy input to grow, harvest, and
use energy crops (Ishitani and Johansson, 1996; Leemans,

Uruguay) are typically put at US$1.8/GJ with projected costs
of US$1.4/GJ and productivity at 360GJ/hectare per year
(Shell International Ltd.. 1996). Agricultural productivity is
also growing at 2% per year with the prospects of a similar
productivity gain for energy crops (Shell International Ltd.,

"Technology diffusion is an integral part of technical change.
Uptake of a technology that is locally “new” can be viewed as
an innovation. Often, when technology is adopted it is also

simple exploitation of scientific knowledge, Landes (1969),
Wallace (1995), Rosenberg (1997), and others emphasize that
technology diffusion is highly complex. Wallace emphasizes

of this complexity is that no general rules define “what works.”
The process of technology adoption is as context dependent as
that of the original innovation. Rosenberg (1997) also

preferences. Some product innovations — such as those that
result in faster computers or more powerful cars — provide
consumers with more of what they already want. Nevertheless,
successful marketing may depend on consumer acceptance of
the new technology. Other innovations — such as alternative
fuel vehicles or compact fluorescent lights — depend on
consumers accepting different performance characteristics or
even redefining their preferences. An important perspective on
technical change is that of the end-user or consumer of
products and services. Technology can be seen as a means of
satisfying human needs. Several conceptual models have been
developed to describe needs and motivation, although their
empirical foundations are weak (Douglas e7 a/., 1998; Maslow,
1954; Allardt, 1993), In many cases, a given technology helps
to satisfy several different types of need, particularly evident in
two of the most significant areas of energy use: cars and
houses. This tendency of successful technologies to serve
multiple needs contributes to lock-in by making it harder for
competing innovations to replace them fully. Hence, many
attempts to introduce new energy efficient or alternative fuel
technologies, especially in the case of the car, have failed
because of a failure to meet all the needs satisfied by the
incumbent technology. Different individuals may interpret the
same fundamental needs in different ways, in terms of the
technology attributes they desire (OECD, 1996). Deep-seated
cultural values or “metarules” for behavior can be considered
to be filtered through a variety of influences at the socictal,
community, household, and individual level (Douglas et al.,
1998; Strang, 1997). Commercial marketing of products
usually aims to adjust the filters, and encourages people to
associate their deep-seated values with specific product
attributes (Wilhite, 1997). These associations are likely to be
more flexible than the values themselves, and provide a
potential source of future changes in technology choice.

land-use emissions of CH, (Prather, et al., 1995), and about

"A variety of changes in land use can result in anthropogenic
CO, emission or absorption. These changes most obviously
include permanent deforestation or afforestation. However,
many changes in Jand-management practices also contribute to
CO, fluxes because of changes in standing biomass densities or
in soil carbon. Empirical studies of such CO, fluxes are rare, so
that information on current emissions is very poor. Whereas
comprehensive information exists for forests globally, only a
few countries have detailed information on forest and
agricultural land-management practices. Hence, global
estimates of CO, emissions from anthropogenic land-use
change, including those in the SRES, tend to be based entirely
on net deforestation—afforestation and on average figures for
carbon storage per hectare in forests.

The IMAGE 2.1 emission estimates are based on computed
changes in global land cover, which take into account changing
demand for agricultural commodities. Trexler and Haugen
(1995) compute the rate of tropical deforestation on a country-
by-country basis, and include information from questionnaires.
Jepma (1995) uses a combination of three models (a socio-
economic model, a wood demand—supply model, and a land-
use model), while Palo et al. (1997) correlate deforestation
rates with income levels. To further confound this situation, the
factors that affect deforestation vary greatly from place to
place, and therefore need to be defined as locally as possible.

future area of rice cropland is the assumed long-term
improvement in rice productivity. The typical range of

However, there is wide disagreement in the literature as to
typical values of carbon density because of both the many
methods used to measure density and the wide variation in the
mix of tropical forest vegetation.

"As noted above, global estimates can mask significant
differences in assumptions about industrial and developing
regions. For industrial regions, nearly all scenarios assume a
decline in beef production per capita, which is consistent with
the current shift away from the consumption of beef to poultry
and other protein sources. Meanwhile, the scenarios for
developing countries assume a continuing increase in beef
consumption, which grew by 3.1% per year between 1982 and
1994, leading to an overall growth of 1.1% per year globally

"When given on a per capita basis, the range of
deforestation rates is perhaps not as great as expected
(about a factor of eight) considering the wide range of
assumptions and methods used to estimate these rates.
The temporal trend of emissions arises from the
temporal trend of deforestation estimates.

The range of emissions is strongly, but not only,
influenced by the deforestation rates, and at its widest
(a factor 14) can be better explained by the combined
range of per capita deforestation rates, population, and

category, and are reviewed in more detail in Wassmann et al.
(1993, 1997, 1998), Houghton et al. (1995), and Olivier e¢ ai.
(1996). CH, emissions are primarily a function of emission
factors and assumed rice cropland area. In turn, emission
factors depend on cultivation method (wet versus dry
cultivation), water management practices, type of rice variety
planted, and cropping patterns. Most long-term scenarios
assume that the emission factor of CH, per unit area of rice
cropland remains constant with time, although estimates vary
greatly from one scenario reference to another.

"Estimated emissions of CH, from enteric fermentation depend
on assumptions about emission factors per animal and the
number of livestock. As summarized by IPCC (1995), emission
factors vary greatly depending on the type of cow, their feed
regime, and their productivity. Assumptions for the change in
meat production from 1990 to 2100 in existing scenarios vary
greatly, by a factor of 1.2 to 4.2. Despite the wide range of
assumptions about meat production, emissions of the various
scenarios do not vary by more than a factor of two, which
indicates that other assumptions (e.g., animal productivity)
must compensate for the differences in assumed meat
production.

and dairy products can only be met by livestock production in
feedlots, which would result in a rising demand for feed that
requires further development of agricultural land and further
GHG emissions.

"Although the different references are consistent in their
findings about future global fertilizer use, the question arises
whether these are at all reasonable guesses. Some researchers
assume that fertilizer use will increase even more. For
example, Kendall and Pimentel (1994) in their “‘business-as-
usual” scenario assume a 300% increase in the use of nitrogen
and other fertilizers by 2050. Moreover, most studies of future
world food production assume improvements in crop yield.
These yield improvements may imply higher overall rates of
fertilizer use because many high-yielding crop varieties depend
on large amounts of fertilizer.

"Among the anthropogenic sources, cultivated soils are the most
important, contributing 50 to 70% of the anthropogenic total
(see Chapter 5, Table 5-3). This source of N,O is particularly
uncertain as the emission level is a complex function of soil
type, soil humidity, species grown, amount and type of
fertilizer applied, etc. The second largest anthropogenic source
of N,O is industry; two processes account for the bulk of
industrial emissions — nitric acid (HNO,) and adipic acid
production. In both cases N,O is released with the off-gases
from the production facilities. Recently, N,O release from
animal manure was identified as another significant source of
N,O emissions.

"N,O budgets are associated with considerable uncertainties.
Agricultural activities and animal production systems are the
largest anthropogenic sources of these emissions. Recent
calculations using IPCC 1996 revised guidelines indicate that
N,O emission from agriculture is 6.2 MtN as N,O per year
(IPCC, 1996; Mosier et al., 1998). About one-third is related to
direct emissions from the soil, another third is related to N,O
emission from animal waste management, and the final third
originates from indirect N,O emissions through ammonia
(NH,), nitrogen oxides (NO,), and nitrate losses. This compares
to earlier estimates of total anthropogenic emissions that range
between 3.7 and 7.7 MtN (Houghton eg al/., 1995). Industrial

have either stabilized or fallen in many key rice-producing
countries, and suggest that dramatically boosting rice yields
above a level of 4 tons per hectare may require new
technological advances. If the skeptics are right, and the
assumed productivity increases of the “business-as-usual”
scenarios are not realized, then a greater expanse of cropland
would be needed to satisfy the same agricultural demand. This
expansion would lead to still higher emissions of CH, from
rice fields and livestock, and more rapid deforestation and
earlier peaks in the emissions of CO,. However, the lower
increase in productivity probably also implies lower fertilizer
use per hectare, which may lower emissions of N,O from
fertilized soils.

show a stabilizing or decreasing trend, because of the
assumption that the number of livestock will continue to

productivity. Meanwhile, the assumed economic development
in the developing regions will stimulate demand for beef,
which leads to an increase in livestock (despite improvements
in animal productivity) and higher emissions.

"The dominant industrial sources are the production of HNO,
and adipic acid. The key driver for the production of HNO, is
the demand for fertilizer. Hence this emission source is closely
related to the agricultural production driving forces discussed
in Section 3.5, as well as to improvements in production
technologies. Adipic acid, (CH,),(COOH),, is a feedstock for
nylon production and one of the largest-volume synthetic
chemicals produced in the world each year — current annual
global production is [.8 million metric tons (Stevens III, 1993).
Production has an associated by-product of 0.3 kg N,O/kg
adipic acid for unabated emission, which at present results in a
global emission of about 0.4 MtN as N,O annually. Emissions
mostly arise in the OECD countries, which accounted for some
95% of global adipic acid production in 1990 (Davis and
Kemp, 1991). Fenhann (2000) reviews the (sparse) scenario
literature and concludes that future emissions will be
determined mostly by two variables - demand growth as a
result of growth in economic activity and progressively
phased-in emission controls.

equipped with three-way catalytic converters have N,O
emissions that range from 0.01 to 0.1 g/km in new catalysts,
and from 0.16 to 0.22 g/km in aging catalysts (IPCC, 1996).
Emission levels also depend on precise engine running

"Major adipic acid producers worldwide have agreed to
substantially reduce N,O emissions by 1996 to 1998. In July
1991 they formed an inter-industry group to share information
on old and new technologies developed for N,O abatement,
such as improved thermal destruction, conversion into nitric
oxide for recycling, and the promising low-temperature N,O
catalytic decomposition into N, currently being developed by
DuPont. The introduction of all three technologies could result
in a 99% reduction of N,O emissions from adipic acid
production (Storey, 1996), They are expected to be introduced
at plants owned by Asahi (Japan), BASF and Bayer (Germany),
DuPont (US), and Rhéne-Poulenc (France) (Chemical Week,
1994), After the planned changes, US producers will have
abated over 90% of the N,O emissions from adipic acid
production. In recent years nylon-6.6 production dropped in the
US, Western Europe, and Japan, largely in response to capacity
and production in other Asian countries. By 2000 production is
expected to recover in these countries (Storey, 1996).

"The introduction of catalytic converters as a pollution control
measure in the majority of industrialized countries is resulting
in a substantial increase in N,O emissions from gasoline

from this source in their national communications to the
UNFCCC, using a variety of projection methods (for example,
Environment Canada, 1997; UNFCCC, 1997; VROM, 1997).
The projections from these counties differ substantially in the
contribution that transport is expected to make to their national
N,O emissions in 2020, ranging from about 10% in France to
over 25% in Canada. They anticipate that mitigation measures
will be much more effective in reducing industrial and
agricultural emissions of NO than mobile source emissions.
Indeed, little research has been carried out to identify catalytic

However, emissions are likely to be lower in countries that
require regular emission inspections and replacement of faulty

normally associated with underground mining. Emissions per
ton of coal mined can vary widely both from country to country
and at adjacent mines within a country (IEA Greenhouse Gases
R&D Programme, 1996a). CH, mixed with air in the right
proportions is an explosive mixture and a danger to miners.
Measures to capture and drain the CH, are common in many
countries — the captured CH,, if of adequate concentration, can
be a valuable energy source. The techniques currently used
reduce total emissions by about 10%. Many older, deeper coal
mines in Europe are being closed, which will reduce emissions.
Replacement coal mines tend to be in exporting countries with
low cost reserves near the surface, so the emissions will be low.
For the future, emissions will depend principally on the
proportion of coal production from deep mines and on total
coal production.

"Emissions from the extraction, processing, and use of fossil
fuels will be driven by future fossil fuel use. CH, emissions
from venting during oil and gas production may decrease
because of efforts to reduce them (IGU, !997b). Flaring and
venting volumes from oil and gas operations peaked in 1976 to
1978, but a gradual reduction in volumes of gas flared and
vented has occurred over the past 20 years (Boden et al., 1994,
Marland e¢ al., 1998; Stern and Kaufmann, 1998). Shell
International Ltd, (1998) estimated a reduction in its own
emissions from venting by 1 MtCH., per year to 0.367 MiCH,
in the five years to 1997. The IEA Greenhouse Gases R&D
Programme (1997) notes that emission reductions from the oil
and gas sector would yield a high economic return,
Additionally, new natural gas developments generally use the
latest technology and are almost leak free compared to older
systems. Taking all these factors into account, it seems plausible
that CH, emissions from the oil and gas sector should fall as the
21 century progresses. Nonetheless, the primary driver (oil and
gas production) is likely to expand significantly in the future,
depending on resource availability and technological change. A
representative range from the literature, for example the
scenarios described in Naki¢enovié et al. (1998a), indicates
substantial uncertainty in which future levels of oil and gas
production could range between 130 and some 900 EJ.
Assuming a constant emission factor, future CH, emissions
from oil and gas could range from a decline compared to
current levels to a fourfold increase. With the more likely
assumption of declining emission factors, future emission levels
would be somewhat lower than suggested by this range.

Conversely, CH, capture, either during mining or prior to
mining, not only reduces risk to miners but also provides a
valuable energy source. Thus, rising levels of CH, capture for
non-climate reasons are likely to characterize the 21% century.
This would in particular apply to high coal production
scenarios, in which most of the coal will need to come from
deep mining once the easily accessible surface mine deposits
have become exhausted. Growth in future emissions from coal
mining is therefore likely to be substantially lower than growth
in coal production.

"Griibler (1998c) reviewed the literature and empirical
evidence, and showed that both clusters of driving forces are
linked to the level of economic development. With increasing
affluence, energy use per capita rises and its structure changes
away from traditional solid fuels (coal, lignite, peat, fuelwood)
toward cleaner fuels (gas or electricity) at the point of end-use.
This structural shift combined with the greater emphasis on
urban air quality that accompanies rising incomes results in a
roughly inverted U (IU) pattern of SO, emissions and/or
concentrations, Emissions rise initially (with growing per
capita energy use), pass through a maximum, and decline at
higher income levels due to structural change in the end-use

"In summary, numerous factors could lead to increases in
emissions of CH, in the future, primarily related to the
expansion of agricultural production and greater fossil fuel use.
Recent studies also identify a number of processes and trends
that could reduce CH, emission factors and hence may lead to
reduced emissions in the future. These trends are not yet
sufficiently accounted for in the literature, in which CH,
emission factors typically are held constant. The overall
consequence is to introduce additional uncertainty into
projections, as the future evolution of such emission factors is
unclear. However, from the above discussion, the least likely
future is one of constant emission factors and the range of
future emissions is likely to be lower than those projected in
previous scenarios with comparable growth in primary activity
drivers.

"(1997) point out that the two schemes discussed by Rudd ef al.
(1993) and Fearmside (1995) may be exceptional, with very
large reservoir surface areas, a high density of organic matter,
and low power output. Gagnon and van de Vate (1997) estimate
the combined CH, and N,O emissions from hydroelectric
schemes at 5.5 gC equivalent per kWh compared to a range of
80 to 200 gC equivalent per kWh for a modern fossil power
station (Rogner and Khan, 1998); that is, hydroelectric power
emits less than 3% and 7%, respectively. While some GHG
emissions from new hydroelectric schemes are expected in the
future, especially in tropical settings (Galy-Lacaux et al.,
1999), in the absence of more comprehensive field data, such
schemes are regarded as a lower source of CH, emissions
compared to those of other energy sector or agricultural
activities. Hydroelectric power is therefore not treated as a
separate emission category in SRES.

"Domestic and some industrial wastes contain organic matter
that emits a combination of CO, and CH, on decomposition
(IEA Greenhouse Gases R&D Programme, 1996b). If oxygen
is present, most of the waste degrades by aerobic micro-
organisms and the main product is CO,. If no oxygen is
present, different micro-organisms become active and a
mixture of CO, and CH, is produced. Decay by this
mechanism can take months or even years (US EPA, 1994).
Traditionally, waste has been dumped in open pits and this is
still the main practice in most developing countries. Thus,
oxygen is present and the main decay product is CO,. In recent
decades, health and local environmental concerns in developed
countries have resulted in better waste management, with lined
pits and a cap of clay, for example, added regularly over newer
dumps. This prevents fresh supplies of oxygen becoming
available so the subsequent decay process is anaerobic and CH,
is produced. Williams (1993) notes that landfill sites are
complex and highly variable biologic systems and many
factors can lead to a wide variability in CH, production. For the
future, increasing wealth and urbanization in developing
countries may lead to more managed landfill sites and to more
CH, production, However, the CH, produced can be captured
and utilized as a valuable energy source, or at least flared for
pollution and safety reasons; indeed, this is a legal requirement
in the USA for large landfills. Future emissions are therefore
unlikely to evolve linearly with population growth and waste
generation, but the scenario literature is extremely sparse on
this subject — the major source remains the previous IS92
scenario series (Pepper et al., 1992).

Historically, the decline in sulfur pollution levels was achieved
simply by dispersion of pollutants (tall stacks policy).

complete coverage of SO, emission sources in long-term
scenario studies and models. Lower values correspond to
studies that include only the dominant energy sector emissions
(range of 59.7 to 65.4 MtS), and higher estimates also include
other sources, most notably metallurgical and from biomass

supported by existing policies and trends in Brazil, China, and

the well-documented impacts on human health, ecosystems

These studies are particularly important because they
document environmental changes of high-emission scenarios
by using detailed representations of the numerous non-linear
dose-response relationships between emissions, atmospheric
concentrations, deposition, ecosystems sensitivity thresholds,
and impacts. All recent studies agree that unabated high SO,

high impacts not only for natural ecosystems and forests, but
also for economically important food crops and human health,

in Figure 3-17, which contrasts 1990 European sulfur

scenarios, SO, emissions in Asia alone could surpass current
global levels as early as 2020 (Amann et al., 1995; Posch et al.,

Europe in 1990 in the area of the borders of the Czech
Republic, Poland, and Germany (the former GDR), often
referred to as the “black triangle.” In view of its ecological
impacts it was officially designated by UNEP as an “ecological
disaster zone.” In a scenario such as IS92a (or even higher

"The review of recent literature on acidification impact studies
given in Grubler (1998c) concludes that the impacts on human
health, on economically important food crops, and on
ecosystems are so substantial as to render any scenario with
SO, emissions as high as, or higher than, IS92a very unlikely.
Griibler (1998c) carried out a detailed comparison of SO,
emissions scenarios at the global and regional level. He
concluded that the range of future SO, emissions spanned by
the previous high-demand IPCC scenarios (all [S92 scenarios
except IS92c and [S92d) corresponded well with scenarios
available in the literature that do not include any direct sulfur-
emissions control or indirect intervention measures and policies
(Figure 3-18). Typically, in such scenarios, global SO,
emissions could rise to between 130 and 250 MtS by 2100, and
in some older scenarios (Matsuoka ef al., 1994; Morita et al.,
"	Text
"1994) are projected to rise above that level. Interestingly, all
long-term sulfur scenarios published since 1995 do not judge
this to be a likely (not to mention environmentally desirable)
possibility. Representative sulfur-emissions controf and
intervention scenarios (Amann et al., 1995; Posch et al., 1996;
Nakicenovié et a/., 19984) suggest instead an upper range of
global emissions below 100 MtS by 2050 and below 120 MtS by
2100, a range covered in the two low variants IS92c and IS92d
only. These patterns were also confirmed by Pepper er al. (1998)
in a recent re-analysis of the previous [S92 scenarios. Using the
same methodology as deployed in developing the IS92
scenarios, the revised scenarios have maximum global SO,
emissions below 142 MtS by 2020, and 56 MtS by 2100 (EPA3
and EPAS scenarios, respectively). The median from the more
recent scenario literature analyzed in Griibler (1998c) indicates
near-constant global SO, emissions — 77 MtS by 2020, 68 MtS
by 2060, and 57 MIS by 2100. This global stability, however,
masks decisive regional differences (discussed above).
Emissions in the OECD countries will continue their declining
trends in line with their sulfur reduction policies. Emissions
outside OECD will rise initially with increasing energy demand,
but sulfur controls will be progressively phased in to mitigate
against impacts of high unabated SO, emissions on health,
agriculture, ecosystems, and tourism.

"The need to abate local air pollution, including SO, emissions,
is not only environmental, but also economic. For example,
according to the World Bank (1997c, 1997d) the current
damage by environmental pollution is about 8% of GDP in
China (and up to 20% of production in urban areas), white
abatement costs would be between 1 and 2.5% of GDP.
According to one World Bank (1997c) report, the costs are “so
high under the business-as-usual scenario that it is hardly
necessary to consider the amenity and ecosystem benefits of
cleaner air to justify action.” Therefore, it is no surprise that in
several developing regions, policies are already being
developed and implemented to abate SO, emissions. In China,
by 1995 coal-cleaning technology had been developed, and
de-sulfurizing technology introduced and applied
(Government of People’s Republic of China, 1996). The so,
emissions target set by the Chinese government is 12.3 MtS by
2000 as compared to 11.9 MtS in 1995. Economic
instruments, such as pollution charges, pricing policy,
favorable terms of investment for environmental technology,
market creation, and ecological compensation fees, are being
introduced in China now (UNEP, 1999). By June 1997, some
64,000 enterprises with heavy pollutant emissions had been
closed for refurbishment or had ceased production. As a
consequence, ambient concentrations of sulfur have been
relatively stable in medium-size and small cities, and they
have actually decreased in large cities. This change is
occurring at significantly lower levels of income as compared
to income levels in the USA and Europe at the time when their
sulfur abatement started.

at 1800 to 2700 MtC per year in the decade before 1994, The
most important of the approximately 1000 TgC anthropogenic
sources are technological (300 to 550 MtC per year) and
biomass burning (300 to 700 MtC per year). Technological
sources dominate in the northern hemisphere, and include
transport, combustion, industrial processes, and refuse
incineration, Biomass burning dominates in the southern
hemisphere, and includes burning of agricultural waste,
savanna burning, and deforestation. The detailed,
geographically explicit EDGAR database (Olivier er al., 1996)
has similar emissions estimates for CO. Other sources are
biogenics (60 to 160 MtC per year), oceans (20 to 200 MtC per
year), and oxidation of CH, (400 to 1000 MtC per year) and of
NMVOCs (200 to 600 MtC per year). To a large extent, this
oxidation may be considered anthropogenic in origin because
many emissions sources of CH, and NMVOCs are of an
anthropogenic nature.

"This category of GHG emissions comprises a wide basket of
different gas species that originate from a multitude of

are released into the atmosphere in comparatively small
amounts, but on a molecular basis most of the gases are long-

they have a strong greenhouse forcing per molecule (see

In this approach, future total demand for CFCs, HFCs, and
other CFC substitutes is estimated on the basis of historical
trends. HFC emissions are calculated using an assumed future
replacement of CFCs by HFCs and other substitutes. The main
drivers for the emissions are population and GDP growth. The
sparse literature available (reviewed in Fenhann, 2000)
indicates that emissions are related non-linearly to these
driving forces, with important possibilities for saturation
effects and long-term decoupling between growth in driving
force variables and emissions. The emissions have been tuned
to agree with emissions scenarios presented at the joint
IPCC-TEAP expert meeting (WMO/UNEP, 1999). Material

"Anthropogenic emissions of gases that cause stratospheric
ozone depletion (chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochloro-
fluorocarbons (HCFCs), halons, methylchloroform, carbon
tetrachloride, and methylbromide) are controlled by
consumption restrictions (production plus imports minus
exports) in the Montreal Protocol. No special SRES scenarios
were developed for these gases because their future emission
levels (phase out) are primarily policy driven and hence
unrelated to scenario variations of important driving-force
variables such as population, economic growth, or industrial
output. Instead, the Montreal Protocol scenario (A3, maximum
allowed production scenario) from the 1998 WMO/UNEP
Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion is used
(WMO/UNEP, 1998).

"No long-term global scenarios for emissions of NMVOCs and
CO were identified beyond 1S92, which assumes increasing
emissions. The important role of biomass combustion in these
emissions means that a scenario with low carbon emissions
because of an increased used of biomass energy does not
automatically lead to low emissions of NMVOCs and CO.
Also, emissions trends are influenced significantly by
assumptions as to the type of combustion or other conversion
technology (e.g. gasification) deployed in the future. If
biomass fuel is used in modern large power plants or boilers, or
is to be converted into modern energy carriers, CO emissions
will be almost negligible compared to those of traditional uses.
As with sulfur, however, it seems plausible that with rising
incomes, abatement of the ozone precursors may be initiated in
non-OECD regions to address local and particularly regional
air pollution (photochemical smog). Since control of these
substances is more difficult than that of sulfur, it may not be
implemented until later.

"SF, emissions originate from two main activities — the use of
SF, as a gas insulator in high-voltage electricity equipment,
and its use in magnesium foundries, in which SF, prevents the
oxidation of molten magnesium. The driver for the former is
electricity demand and for the latter it is future magnesium
production, which will depend on GDP and a consumption
elasticity. Emission factor reductions over time that result from
more careful handling, recovery, recycling, and substitution of
SF, are assumed for both sources. Fenhann (2000) assumes
that in low future scenarios SF, emissions factors decline to
one-tenth their present values between 2020 and 2090. In high
future scenarios, Fenhann (2000) assumes reduction levels are
somewhat lower, ranging from 55% to 90% depending on the
region. In the absence of scenario literature, these assumptions
are retained here (see Chapter 5). Other applications of SF,
include as a tracer gas in medical surgery and the production of
semiconductors, and as an insulator in some windows.
However, these sources are assumed to be cause less than 1%
of the global emissions.

"For PFCs (CF, and C,F,) the emissions driver is primary
aluminum production, which is generally modeled using GDP
and a consumption elasticity. Recycling rates are increasingly
important, as reflected in the SRES scenarios (see Chapter 5).
Aluminum production by the Soederberg process resulted, on
average, in the emission of 0.45 kgCF, per tAl and 0.02 kgC,F,
per tAl in 1998 in Norway. The effect of future technological
change on the emissions factor can be assumed to be large,
since the costs of modifications in process technology can be
offset by the costs of saved energy. A considerable reduction in
the emission factors has already taken place and the present
emission factor of 0.5 kgCF, per tAl is expected to fall to 0.15
kgCF, per tAl at various rates (see Chapter 5). An emission
factor for C,F,, 10 times lower than that of CF, was used in the
calculations. The present trend of not replacing CFCs and
HCFCs with high global warming compounds like PFCs (or
SF,) is also assumed to continue, which might underestimate
the effect of future emissions. The only other source included
for PFC emissions is semiconductor manufacturing, for which
the industry has globally adopted a voluntary agreement to
reduce its PFC emissions by 10% in 2010 relative to 1995
levels.

the same token, demographic policies for health and education

"Over a period of 100 years the policies that most influence the
development of GHG emissions are probably those that
contribute to the processes of technical and social innovation,

Innovation policies mostly emphasize the development of
technologies that improve international competitiveness with
new products and improved performance or reduced costs of
existing products. The policies are not usually designed to
achieve these and other (¢.g., environmental and_ social)
objectives in an integrated way (OECD, 1998b). Hence, their
impact on GHG emissions is hard to predict, but as currently
constituted many national systems for innovation could tend to
increase emissions by stimulating economic growth.

"Government policies on energy and agriculture have, on the
whole, paralleled global trends during the 20"" century. Early in
the century there was a move toward protectionism, which
aimed to secure national self-sufficiency, especially in food and
energy. Governments established import quotas and tariffs,
subsidies for domestic production, and research and investment
programs to improve agricultural productivity and develop new
energy sources, During the 1980s policy emphasis shifted in
many countries, and has continued into the 1990s, toward open
borders and reduced subsidies and R&D. Nonetheless,
numerous energy and agricultural policies persist that
influence production and trade patterns and hence also GHG
emissions.

supply, high employment, and long-term economic growth
(Maddison, 1995). The encouragement may take many forms,
such as direct subsidies and protection from foreign
competition, public investment in infrastructure, training, or
R&D, and support for collaborative development programs
and information networks (OECD, 1997a). If governments
support sectors that are fossil-fuel intensive, the tendency to
increase GHG emissions is clear. However, protectionist
policies may also reduce national economic efficiency, which
dampens income growth and tends to restrict growth in GHG
emissions. Conversely, if governments support the
development of rapid-growth sectors, the tendency may be to
promote long-term economic growth, increase household
income and consumption, and hence increase GHG

"Agricultural policy reform has received more attention than
energy policy reform in recent years. Most OECD countries
support domestic agriculture, whether through direct subsidies,
import tariffs, or price controls. The general trend is toward a
reduction in these supports, in part as a result of trade
negotiations, but also as part of the broader trend toward
policies that reduce budget deficits and improve market
efficiency. Supports are also being reformed to reduce their
linkage to production volumes. Where subsidies are linked to
the volume of production, they provide an incentive to increase
output beyond the level of demand, which leads to surpluses.
This incentive may tend to increase GHG emissions as a result
of soil carbon depletion and oxidation, excessive use of
nitrogen fertilizer leading to N,O emissions, and over-intensive
animal farming that results in excess CH, emissions from
manure and from the animals themselves (OECD, 1997b;
Storey, 1997). The overall impact of agriculture subsidy
reforms on GHG emissions will depend on associated fiscal
changes in other parts of the economy.
"	Text
"Many reports point to government subsidies as a major
impediment to cleaner production of energy (Burniaux et al.,
1992; Larsen and Shah, 1992; de Moor and Calamai, 1996;
Roodman, 1996; Greenpeace, 1997). In addition to direct
subsidies, governments use a wide variety of measures to
support domestic or regional industries, or to protect legal
monopolies, These policies inhibit innovation and can lead to
higher levels of pollution or resource intensity than would
occur in a less constrained market. A recent OECD study found
that reform of supports to coal, electricity, and transport could
substantially reduce CO, and acid rain emissions in some
countries (OECD, 1997a). In other countries, subsidy reform
would have minimal direct environmental benefits, but would
increase the effectiveness or reduce the cost of environmental
policies such as eco-taxes and emission limits, Where subsidies
support nuclear power or other non-fossil energy sources, their
reform could conversely lead to increased GHG emissions.
Energy taxes also have an important influence on energy
demand and hence GHG emissions. The majority of energy
taxes are intended as a pure fiscal instrument or, in the case of
road fuel taxes in some countries, to raise funds for road
provision and maintenance. Many countries are raising these
taxes, or considering doing so.

trend has developed to support organic farming and regional

assumptions in the models used to generate long-term GHG

control policies, a wide body of literature can be drawn upon to
derive specific pollution control levels or maximum emission
trajectories consistent with a particular interpretation of a
scenario storyline. In other areas, such as GHG gases
controlled by the Montreal Protocol, existing scenarios that
reflect the most up-to-date information are used as direct input
to SRES.

"Policies on infrastructure may have a very long-term influence
on GHG emissions. although in many cases the causal
relationships are complex and not understood well enough to
justify quantitative analyses of the policy options. These
include urban planning guidance, construction regulations,
policies on ownership and financing of infrastructure, and user
pricing for roads and parking. The most significant impacts on
GHG emissions are likely to derive from policies that influence
demand for travel by car and for freight transport by truck
(Newman and Kenworthy, 1990; Michaelis et al., 1996;
Watson et al., 1996), those that influence energy use in
buildings (Levine et al., 1996; Watson et al., 1996), and those
that influence the conversion of forest for agriculture, or
agricultural land for urban development.
"	Text
"Few of the policies and instruments identified above can be
represented directly in the models typically used to produce
GHG emission scenarios. In general, the impacts of policies
are highly uncertain (Houghton et al., 1996). Price-based
instruments have been analyzed in greater detail than other
types of measure, and many empirical studies have been
carried out to determine the response to price changes of
demand for various commodities, especially energy. However,
such research and analysis usually yields very large ranges of
uncertainty in the magnitude of the price response, and often
reveals a strong dependence on specific circumstances. Even
for price-based policies, national and global effects over
20-100 years are very uncertain. For the SRES, it is not
possible to make a precise link between governments’
application of specific policies and the outcome in the various
scenarios.
"	Text
"In the context of non-mitigation GHG emission scenarios,
probably the most important environmental policies are those
related to sulfur emissions (see Section 3.4.3). Sulfur
emissions are controlled for local and regional environmental
reasons, but sulfur oxides do have a radiative impact, and sulfur
controls can lead to the switching of fuel away from coal and
oil. Thus, almost paradoxically, environmental policies to
combat urban air pollution and acid rain may (via reduced
sulfate aerosol “cooling”) exacerbate climate change. Most
sulfur control policies to date have involved either regulations
that limit the concentration of sulfur oxides in flue gas from
large combustion plants, or give standards for the sulfur
content of fuel. Recently, sulfur control policies have become
more sophisticated, and aim to limit aggregate emissions on a
national or regional basis to minimize acidic deposition in a
trans-national context. New policy instruments have also been
introduced. The USA has pioneered a “cap and trade” system
with tradable emission permits (for a review see Joskow et al.,
1998).

"4.1. Introduction
"	Title
"The titles of the storylines are deliberately simple ~ Al, A2,
B1, and B2. There is no particular order among the storylines
(they are listed alphabetically). Figure 4-1 shows that the SRES
scenarios build on the main driving forces of GHG emissions.
Each scenario family is based on a common specification of the
main driving forces.
"	Text
"Chapters 2 and 3 demonstrate the large uncertainty in the
literature that surrounds both future emissions and the possible
developments of their underlying driving forces. The
uncertainties range from inadequate scientific understanding of
the problems, through data gaps or lack of data, to the inherent
uncertainties of future events in general. Hence alternative
scenarios are used to describe the range of possible future
emissions.
"	Text
"The broad consensus among the SRES writing team is that the
current literature analysis suggests the future is inherently
unpredictable and so views will differ as to which of the
storylines and representative scenarios could be more or less
likely. Therefore, the development of a single “best guess” or
“business-as-usual” scenario is neither desirable nor possible.
Nor should the storylines and scenarios be taken as policy
tecommendations, The storylines represent the playing out of
certain social, economic, technological, and environmental
"	Text
"In Chapter 4 the main characteristics of the scenarios
developed for the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios
(SRES scenarios) are presented. These scenarios cover a wide
range of driving forces from demographic to social and
economic developments, and they encompass a wide range of
future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (see Chapter 5).
Chapters 2 and 3 provide an overview and assessment of the
scenario literature, the main driving forces of future GHG
emissions, and their relationships. How the driving forces are
combined to produce a set of scenarios that cover the ranges of
GHG emissions from the literature is described in this chapter.
"	Text
"Each storyline is basically a short “history” of a possible future
development expressed as a combination of key scenario
characteristics. These descriptions are stylized and designed to
facilitate specification and further interpretation of scenario
quantifications. The storylines identify particular dynamics,
visible in the world today, that might have important influences
on future GHG emissions. They deliberately explore what
might happen if social, economic, technical, and policy
developments take a particular direction at the global level;
they also pay attention to regional differences and interactions,
especially between developing and industrialized countries.
"	Text
"The SRES approach involved the development of a set of four
alternative scenario “families” (see Chapter 1, Section 1.7.2).
Each family of SRES scenarios includes a descriptive part
(called a “storyline”) and a number of alternative interpretations
and quantifications of each storyline developed by six different
modeling approaches (see also Box 1-1 on terminology). Each
storyline describes a demographic, social, economic,
technological, and policy future for each of the scenario
families. Within each family different scenarios explore
variations of global and regional developments and their
implications for GHG, ozone precursors, and sulfur emissions.
Each of these scenarios is consistent with the broad framework
specified by the storyline of the scenario family.
"	Text
"All four storylines and scenario families describe future worlds
that are generally more affluent compared to the current
situation. They range from very rapid economic growth and
technologic change to high levels of environmental protection,
from low-to-high global populations, and from high-to-low
GHG emissions. Perhaps more importantly, all the storylines
describe dynamic changes and transitions in generally different
directions, The storylines do not include specific climate-
change policies, but they do include numerous other socio-
economic developments and non-climate environmental
policies. As time progresses, the storylines diverge from each
other in many of their characteristic features. In this way they
span the relevant range of GHG emissions and different
combinations of their main sources.
"	Text
"After the basic features and driving forces for each of the four
storylines had been determined, the team quantified the
storylines into individual scenarios with the help of formal
(computer) models. While the writing team and the modeling
groups included experts from around the world, all six
modeling groups are based in Europe, North America, and
Japan. As indicated above, each model quantification of a
storyline constitutes a scenario, and all scenarios of one
storyline constitute a “scenario family.” The six models are
representative of different approaches to emissions-scenario
modeling and different integrated assessment frameworks in
the literature, and include so-called top-down and bottom-up
models. The use of different models reflects the SRES Terms
of Reference call for methodologic pluralism and for an open
process (see Appendix I). The number and type of models
chosen in the open process was on a voluntary basis. In January
1997 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working

"paradigms, which will be viewed positively by some people
and negatively by others. The SRES writing team decided on
four storylines — an even number helps to avoid the impression
of a “central” or “most likely” case. The team wanted more
than two storylines to help illustrate that the future depends on
many different underlying dynamics; the team wanted no more
than four to avoid complicating the process with too many
alternatives. The scenarios cover a wide range of, but not all
possible, futures. In particular, it was decided that possible
“surprises” would not be considered and that there would be no
“disaster” scenarios. The team decided to carry out sensitivity
tests within some of the storylines by considering alternative
scenarios with different fossil-fuel reserves, rates of economic
growth, or rates of technical change. These sensitivity analyses
resulted in groups of scenarios within a given scenario family
and alternative scenario interpretations within a scenario group
or family (see Section 4.2 below for a description of scenario
terminology and taxonomy).

"The primary purpose of developing multiple scenario families
was to explore the uncertainties behind potential trends in
global developments and GHG emissions, as well as the key
drivers that influence these (see also Chapter 1, Section 1.7.2).

to Governments asking for nominations of modeling teams to
contribute to SRES and advertised in a number of scientific
journals for modelers to participate in SRES. Six different

volunteered to participate in the formulation and development
of the scenarios in response to the call. [t is fortunate that they
are from three different continents and also include different
methodological approaches used in the literature to develop
quantitative emissions scenarios,

Figure 4-1: The four SRES scenario families that share
common storylines are illustrated as branches of a two-
dimensional tree. The two dimensions indicate the relative
orientation of the different scenario storylines toward
economic or environmental concerns and global and
regional scenario development patterns, respectively. There
is no implication that these two are mutually exclusive or
incompatible. In reality, the four scenarios share a space of
a much higher dimensionality given the numerous driving
forces and other assumptions needed to define any given
scenario in a particular modeling approach. The Al
storyline branches out into different groups of scenarios to
illustrate that alternative development paths are possible
within one scenario family.
"	Text
"Each storyline was characterized initially by two quantitative
“targets,” namely global population (15, 10, and 7 billion by
2100 in scenarios A2, B2, and both Al and B1, respectively)
and global gross domestic product (GDP) by 2100 (in 1990 US
dollars, US$550 trillion for Al, US$250 trillion for A2,
US$350 trillion for B1, and US$250 trillion for B2). These
quantitative targets guided the subsequent quantification of the
SRES scenarios with different model approaches. Generally,
the orders of magnitude of these original quantitative scenario
“guideposts” are reflected in the final SRES scenarios (see
Table 4-2) and have been adopted in a majority of SRES
scenarios. Evidently, the quantitative characteristics of the four
SRES scenario families comprise many more dimensions than
this, in particular regional patterns, differences in resource and
technology availability, land-use changes, non-carbon dioxide
(CO,) GHGs, etc, These are discussed in the subsequent
Sections.
"	Text
"The SRES scenario quantifications of the main indicators (such
as population and economic growth, characteristics of the
energy system, and the associated GHG emissions) all fall
within the range of studies published in the literature and
scenarios documented in the SRES database (see Chapter 2).
Quantitative mdicators form an important part of each scenario
description. These indicators include gross world product,
population, supply and demand for principal energy forms,
energy resource characteristics, the breakdown of land use, and
emissions of various GHGs. The scenarios are designed so that
the evolution of their indicators over the 215' century falls well
within the range represented by scenarios from the literature
and included in the SRES database (see Chapter 2 and Morita
and Lee, 1998; Nakiéenovi¢, et al., 1998). More importantly,
they correspond to the qualitative characteristics of the
respective storylines. Also, they were revised iteratively within
the six modeling approaches to achieve internal consistency on
the basis of inputs from the entire SRES writing team and the
SRES open process.

"By 2100 the world will have changed in ways that are difficult
to imagine, as difficult as it was at the end of the 19"" century
to imagine the changes of the 20"" century. However, each
storyline takes a different direction of future developments so
that they differ in an increasingly irreversible way. They
describe divergent futures that reflect a significant portion of
the underlying uncertainties in the main driving forces, The
differences among the storylines cover a wide range of the key
“future” characteristics, such as technology, governance, and
behavioral patterns. Hence the plausibility or feasibility of the
storyline assumptions should be viewed with an “open mind,”
not from a narrow interpretation of current situations and
trends in economic conditions, technology developments, and
social and governing structures.
"	Text
"Four brief “future histories” captured by the SRES storylines
differ in how global regions interrelate, how new technologies
diffuse, how regional economic activities evolve, how
protection of local and regional environments is implemented,
and how demographic structure changes. The “qualitative”
storyline characteristics include various political, social,
cultural, and educational conditions (e.g., type of governance,
social structure, and educational level) that often cannot be
defined in strictly quantitative terms and do not directly “drive”
GHG emissions. These qualitative variables, however,
participate in complex “cause-effect” relationships with
quantitative emission drivers (e.g., economic activities,
population levels, energy consumption). Their explicit
inclusion in the scenario development process not only makes
scenarios more “plausible” and “believable,” but also ensures
they do not become an arbitrary numeric combination of
quantitative parameters.
"	Text
"The SRES scenarios are intended to exclude catastrophic futures. Such catastrophic futures feature prominently in the literature.
They typically involve large-scale environmental or economic collapses, and extrapolate current unfavorable conditions and
trends in many regions. Prominent examples of such scenarios include “Retrenchment” (Kinsman, 1990), “Dark Side of the
Market World” or “Change without Progress” (Schwartz, 1991), “Black and Grey” (Godet et al., 1994), “Global Incoherence
Scenario” (Peterson, 1994), “New World Disorder” (Schwartz, 1996), “A Visit to Belindia” (Pohl, 1994), the future evoked by
the description of the current situation in parts of West-Africa and Central Asia (Kaplan, 1996), “Barbarization” (Gallopin et al.,
1997), “Dark Space” (Glenn and Gordon, 1999), “Global Fragmentation” (Lawrence et al., 1997), and “A Passive Mean World”
(Glenn and Gordon, 1997, 1999). In this last scenario the world is carved up into three rigid and distinct trading blocs, with
fragmented political boundaries and out-of-control ethnic conflicts. In “Global Crisis” (de Jong and Zalm, 1991; CPB, 1992)
protectionism leads to a vicious circle of slowing economic growth and eventually breakdown. Many of these scenarios suggest
that catastrophic developments may draw the world into a state of chaos within one or two decades. In such scenarios GHG
emissions might be low because of low or negative economic growth, but it seems unlikely they would receive much attention
in the light of more immediate problems. Hence, this report does not analyze such futures.

"1 During the approval process of the Summary for Policymakers at
the Sth Session of WGIII of the IPCC from 8-11 March 2000 in
Katmandu, Nepal, it was decided to combine two of thiese groups (
AIC and A1G) into one “fossil intensive"" group A1FI, in contrast to
the non-fossil group AIT, and to select two illustrative scenarios
from these two A] groups to facilitate use by modelers and policy
makers. This leads to six scenario groups that constitute the four
scenario families, three of which are in the Al family. All scenarios
are equally sound.
"	Text
"The A1 storyline and scenario family describes a future
world of very rapid economic growth, low population
growth, and the rapid introduction of new and more
efficient technologies. Major underlying themes are
convergence among regions, capacity building, and
increased cultural and social interactions, with a
substantial reduction in regional differences in per
capita income. The Al scenario family develops into
four groups that describe alternative directions of
technological change in the energy system.!
"	List
"The extent to which the currently observed economic and
environmental orientations will prevail in the 21% century is
pertinent to the distinction between Al and A2 scenario
families on one side and B1 and B2 scenario families on the
other side. In the Bl and B2 storylines this transition is
pursued, to different degrees, through a successful translation
of global concerns into local actions to promote environmental
sustainability. Alternatively, in the Al and A2 storylines the
emphasis remains, again to different degrees, on sustained
economic development and achievement of high levels of
affluence throughout the world, where environmental priorities
are perceived as less important than those of economic
development (see Box 4-4).
"	Text
"Recent decades have seen considerable growth in discourse
of environmental and social issues, represented at the global
level by several high-level United Nations (UN) meetings on
social and economic development and environmental
sustainability (UNCED, 1992; UN, 1994, 1995; Leach, 1998;
Munasinghe and Swart,2000). The range of participants has
expanded from the most closely involved government
ministries, businesses, and environmental NGOs to include a
broad range of representation by different ministries, local
government, businesses, professions, and community groups.
Increased interest in sustainability issues can lead to all kinds
of socio-economic and technological changes that may not be
aimed explicitly at reducing GHG emissions, but which may
in effect contribute significantly to such reductions.
"	Text
"With the convergence in governments’ economic policies in the
1990s, combined with the rapid development of communication
networks, it is perhaps not surprising that an extensive poll of
scenarios by the Millennium Institute suggested “globalization”
as the main driving force that will shape the future (Glenn and
Gordon, 1997, 1999). However, some scenarios in the literature
explore the possibility that unfettered markets, usually seen as
an integral element of “globalization,” might destabilize society
in ways that endanger the process (Mohan Rao, 1998). In
UNESCO’s 1998 World Culture Report, it is noted that
communities are increasingly emphasizing their cultural
individuality; meanwhile, communication and travel are
resulting in interactions between communities that result in the
evolution of new “local” cultures (UNESCO, 1998).
Huntington (1996) asserts that continental regional cultures
may determine the shape of future geopolitical developments
rather than globalization.
"	Text
"Thus, the storylines describe developments in many different
economic, technical, environmental, and social dimensions.
Consequently, they occupy a multidimensional space and no
simple metric can be used to classify them. Even though they
occupy such a multidimensional space along many driving
forces relevant for GHG emissions, it is useful here to highlight
just two dimensions. The first refers to the extent of economic
convergence and social and cultural interactions across the
regions and the second to the balance between economic
objectives and environmental and equity objectives. Possible
names for these two dimensions could be “globalization” (Box
4-3) and “sustainability,” respectively (Box 4-4). As these two
expressions are not necessarily viewed by everyone as being
value-free, the two dimensions could alternatively be
designated simply as a more global or more regional
orientation and as a more economic or a more environmental
orientation (see Figure 4-1), These dimensions are important in
the SRES scenarios. Nevertheless, there was considerable
resistance in the SRES writing team against such a simplistic
classification of storylines, so it is presented here for
illustrative purposes only. These distinctions are, in a sense,
artificial. For example, both economic and environmental
objectives are pursued in all scenarios, albeit with different
levels of relative emphasis.

other scenario families, but were pursued only to a limited
degree in scenario sensitivity analysis in order to limit the
number of scenarios.) This further increased the richness in
different GHG emissions paths, because this variation in the
structure of the future energy system in itself resulted in a
range of emissions almost as large as that generated through
the variation of other main driving forces, such as population
and economic development. The differentiation into various
scenario groups was introduced into the Al storyline because
of its “high growth with high technology” nature, in which
differences in alternative technology developments translate
into large differences in future GHG emission levels.

scenarios with “full harmonization.” For each scenario family
at least two scenarios are harmonized using the most restrictive
criteria. This also applies to the scenario groups within the Al
scenario family, which correspondingly has the highest number
of fully harmonized scenarios. This subset of “fully
harmonized” scenarios serves to provide a_ better
correspondence between the development of the three main
driving forces and the resultant GHG emissions. The “fully

"driving forces (population, GDP) and order of magnitude of
GHG emissions. Subsequently, additional scenarios within
each scenario family were developed to explore the sensitivity
of adopting alternative quantitative scenario input assumptions
on future GHG emissions. As a result the markers are not
necessarily the median or mean of a scenario family (nor
would it be possible to construct such a median or mean
scenario by taking all salient scenario characteristics and
regional results into account). The markers are simply those
scenarios considered by the SRES writing team as illustrative
of a particula storyline. They are not singled out as more
likely than alternative quantitative interpretations of a
particular scenario family and its underlying storyline.
Perhaps they may be best described as “first among equals.”
However, as a result of time and resource limitations the
marker scenarios have received the closest scrutiny from the
entire writing team and through the SRES open process
compared to other scenario quantifications. The marker
scenarios are also the SRES scenarios most intensively tested
m terms of 1eproducibility. As a rule, at least four different
models were used in attempts to replicate the model
quantification of a particular marker scenario. Available time
and resources did not allow a similar exercise to be conducted
for all SRES scenarios, albeit a more limited effort was
devoted to reproduce the Al scenario groups (next to the Al
marker) with different models.

scenario storylines and the underlying literature. First, a

as positive by others. Second, the storylines represent families
of scenarios that can include both success and failure,
depending on the perspective of the beholder. To quote
Wilkerson (1995): “Like the real life from which they are
drawn, the scenarios are mixed bags, at once wonderfully
dreadful and dreadfully wonderful.” Importantly, the

Figure 4-3: Schematic illustration of the multidimensional classification space of SRES scenarios. The set of scenarios
consists of four scenario families (Al, A2, B1, and B2), each of which consists of a number of scenarios. Some of these have
“harmonized” inputs — they share similar pre-specified global population and GDP trajectories. They are marked as “HS” for
(globally) harmonized scenarios. All other scenarios of the same family based on the quantification of the storyline chosen by
the modeling team are marked as “OS.” The Al family is divided into four scenario groups that explore alternative
developments in the future energy sector. These were merged into three groups in the SPM (see also footnote 1). Finally, one
of the harmonized scenarios is designated as the characteristic representative of each family and is the marker scenario.

"The A2 scenario family represents a differentiated world.
Compared to the Al storyline it is characterized by lower trade

technological change. The A2 world “consolidates” into a
series of economic regions. Self-reliance in terms of resources
and less emphasis on economic, social, and cultural
interactions between regions are characteristic for this future.
Economic growth is uneven and the income gap between now-
industrialized and developing parts of the world does not
narrow, unlike in the Al and BI scenario families.

"The global economy expands at an average annual rate of about
3% to 2100, reaching around US$550 trillion (all dollar
amounts herein are expressed in 1990 dollars, unless stated
otherwise). This is approximately the same as average global
growth since 1850, although the conditions that lead to this
global growth in productivity and per capita incomes in the
scenario are unparalleled in history. Global average income per
capita reaches about US$21,000 by 2050. While the high
average level of income per capita contributes to a great
improvement in the overall health and social conditions of the
majority of people, this world is not necessarily devoid of
problems. In particular, many communities could face some of
the problems of social exclusion encountered in the wealthiest
countries during the 20"" century, and in many places income

growth could produce increased pressure on the global
commons.

"Several scenario groups considered in the Al scenario family
reflect uncertainty in the development of energy sources and
conversion technologies in this rapidly changing world. Some
scenario groups evolve along the carbon-intensive energy path
consistent with the current development strategy of countries
with abundant domestic coal resources. Other scenario groups
intensify the dependence on (unconventional) oil and (in the
longer-run) natural-gas resources®. A third group envisages a
stronger shift toward renewable energy sources and
conceivably also toward nuclear energy. A fourth group (which
includes the A1B marker scenario) assumes a balanced mix of
technologies and supply sources, with technology
improvements and resource assumptions such that no single
source of energy is overly dominant. The implications of these
alternative development paths for future GHG emissions are
challenging: the emissions vary from the carbon-intensive to
decarbonization paths by at least as much as the variation of all
the other driving forces across the other SRES scenarios.
"	Text
"This may be the type of scenario best represented in recent
literature (e.g., Shinn, 1985; UN, 1990; Schwartz, 1991;
Peterson, 1994; Gallopin et al., 1997; Glenn and Gordon,
1997, 1999; Lawrence et al., 1997; Hammond, 1998; Raskin et
al., 1998). Such scenarios are dominated by an American or
European entrepreneurial, progress-oriented perspective in
which technology, especially communication technology, plays
a central role. Wilkerson (1995) designed various scenarios
that share features with Al. They emphasize market-oriented
solutions, high consumption of both tangible and intangible
commodities, advanced technology, and intensive mobility and
communication. In some examples of this type of scenario,
high economic growth leads to shifts of economic power from
traditional core countries to the current economic “periphery,”
as in the “Global Shift” scenario by CPB (1992) and de Jong
and Zalm (1991). The Shell scenario “New Frontiers” (Shell,
1993) is also representative of this family. The IPCC Scenarios
1$92a and I$92e are well-known examples of futures with high
levels of economic growth (Leggett et al., 1992). IIASA and
World Energy Council (WEC) jointly developed three High
Growth Scenarios that share assumptions on rapid
technological progress, liberalized trade markets, and rising
income levels (Nakicenovié et al., 1998).

(1996) suggests that conflicts between civilizations rather than
globalizing economies may determine the geo-political future

"The central elements of the Bl future are a high level of

Heightened environmental consciousness might be brought
about by clear evidence that impacts of natural resource use,
such as deforestation, soil depletion, over-fishing, and global
and regional pollution, pose a serious threat to the continuation
of human life on Earth. In the B1 storyline, governments.
businesses, the media, and the public pay increased attention to
the environmental and social aspects of development.
‘Technological change plays an important role. At the same
time, however, the storyline does not include any climate
policies, to reflect the SRES terms of reference. Nevertheless,
such a possible future cannot be ruled out.

"As in other SRES storylines, the intention in this storyline is
not to imply that the underlying dynamics of A2 are either
good or bad. The literature suggests that such a world could
have many positive aspects from the current perspective, such
as the increasing tendency toward cultural pluralism with
mutual acceptance of diversity and fundamental differences.
Various scenarios from the literature may be grouped under
this scenario family. For example, “New Empires” by Schwartz
(1991) is an example of a society in which most nations protect
their threatened cultural identities, Some regions might achieve
Telative stability while others suffer under civil disorders
(Schwartz, 1996). In “European Renaissance” (de Jong and

the A2 world is one of the main focus areas for innovation and
research, development, and deployment (RD&D) efforts, and
environmental concerns, Initial high levels of soil erosion and
water pollution are eventually eased through the local
development of more sustainable high-yield agriculture.
Although attention is given to potential local and regional
environmental damage, it is not uniform across regions. Global
environmental concerns are relatively weak, although attempts
are made to bring regional and local pollution under control
and to maintain environmental amenities.

"The “Conventional Worlds-Policy Reform” scenario by
Gallopin et al. (1997) is a good example of such a future,
although it includes climate policies. In “Ecotopia,” Wilkerson
(1995) describes a reaction to early decades of crime and
chaos, in which community values triumph over individualist
ones and lead to resource-friendly lifestyles based on clean and
light technologies. This scenario includes a voluntary embrace
of cohesion, cooperation, and reduced consumption, backed by
legislation and even corporate policies (Wilkerson, 1995). In
the normative “Human Development Success” (Glenn and
Gordon, 1997), the world achieves an environmentally
sustainable economy by 2050, primarily through education to
develop human potential. In “Balanced Future” (de Jong and
Zalm, 1991; CPB, 1992), economic equilibrium and innovation
lead to sustainable development. The “Ecologically Driven”
scenarios by WEC (1993) and IIASA—WEC (Nakicenovié et
al., 1998) — with accelerated efficiency improvements in
resource use ~ share several of the characteristics of the BI
type of future, as does the egalitarian utopia scenario in the
TARGETS approach (Rotmans and de Vries, 1997).

"The A2 world has less international cooperation than the Al or
B1 worlds. People, ideas, and capital are less mobile so that
technology diffuses more slowly than in the other scenario
families. International disparities in productivity, and hence
income per capita, are largely maintained or increased in
absolute terms, With the emphasis on family and community
life, fertility rates decline relatively slowly, which makes the
A2 population the largest among the storylines (15 billion by
2100). Global average per capita income in A2 is low relative
to other storylines (especially Al and B{), reaching about
US$7200 per capita by 2050 and US$16,000 in 2100. By 2100
the global GDP reaches about US$250 trillion. Technological
change in the A2 scenario world is also more heterogeneous
than that in Al, It is more rapid than average in some regions
and slower in others, as industry adjusts to local resource
endowments, culture, and education levels. Regions with
abundant energy and mineral resources evolve more resource-
intensive economies, while those poor in resources place a very
high priority on minimizing import dependence through
technological innovation to improve resource efficiency and
make use of substitute inputs. The fuel mix in different regions
is determined primarily by resource availability. High-income
but resource-poor regions shift toward advanced post-fossil
technologies (renewables or nuclear), while low-income
resource-rich regions generally rely on older fossil
technologies. Final energy intensities in A2 decline with a pace

further economic growth, the B1 world invests a large part of
its gains in improved efficiency of resource use

Increasingly, government policies and business strategies at the

stronger communities. International institutions decline in
importance, with a shift toward local and regional decision-
making structures and institutions. Human welfare, equality,

are addressed through community-based social solutions in
addition to technical solutions, although implementation rates
vary across regions.

about seven billion by 2100. This is a world with high levels of
economic activity (a global GDP of around US$350 trillion by
2100) and significant and deliberate progress toward
international and national income equality. Global income per
capita in 2050 averages US$13,000, one-third lower than in
Al. A higher proportion of this income is spent on services
rather than on material goods, and on quality rather than
quantity, because the emphasis on material goods is less and
also resource prices are increased by environmental taxation.

"Particular effort is devoted to increases in resource efficiency to
achieve the goals stated above. Incentive systems, combined
with advances in international institutions, permit the rapid
diffusion of cleaner technology. To this end, R&D is also
enhanced, together with education and the capacity building
for clean and equitable development. Organizational measures
are adopted to reduce material wastage by maximizing reuse
and recycling. The combination of technical and organizational
change yields high levels of material and energy saving, as well
as reductions in pollution. Labor productivity also improves as
a by-product of these efforts. Alternative scenarios considered
within the B1 family include different rates of GDP growth and
dematerialization (e.g., decline in energy and material
intensities).

"Like the other scenario families, the B2 scenario family
includes futures that can be seen as positive or negative. While
the B2 storyline is basically neutral, Kinsman (1990) in his
“Caring Autonomy” scenario clearly paints a positive world
with emphasis on decentralized governments and strong
interpersonal relationships. In the “New Civics” scenario by
Wilkerson (1995), values are only shared within small
competing groups, which results in a decentralized world of
tribes, clans, families, networks, and gangs. The TASA-WEC
“Middle Course” scenario (Nakiéenovié et al., 1998), with
slow removal of trade barriers, may also be grouped in this
family. On the positive side, this storyline appears to be
consistent with current institutional frameworks in the world
and with the current technology dynamics. On the negative side
is the relatively slow rate of development in general, but
particularly in the currently developing parts of the world.

"Given the high environmental consciousness and institutional
effectiveness in the B1 storyline, environmental quality is high,
as most potentially negative environmental aspects of rapid
development are anticipated and effectively dealt with locally,
nationally, and internationally. For example, transboundary air
pollution (acid rain) is basically eliminated in the long term.
Land use is managed carefully to counteract the impacts of
activities potentially damaging to the environment. Cities are
compact and designed for public and non-motorized transport,
with suburban developments tightly controlled. Strong
incentives for low-input, low-impact agriculture, along with
maintenance of large areas of wilderness, contribute to high
food prices with much lower levels of meat consumption than
those in Al. These proactive local and regional environmental
measures and policies also lead to relatively low GHG
emissions, even in the absence of explicit interventions to

"Generally, high educational levels promote both development
and environmental protection. Indeed, environmental
protection is one of the few truly international common
priorities that remain in B2. However, strategies to address
global environmental challenges are not of a central priority
and are thus less successful compared to local and regional
environmental response strategies. The governments have
difficulty designing and implementing agreements that
combine global environmental protection, even when this
could be associated with mutual economic benefits.
"	Text
"The B2 storyline presents a particularly favorable climate for
community initiative and social innovation, especially in view
of the high educational levels. Technological frontiers are
pushed less than they are in Al and B1, and innovations are
also regionally more heterogeneous. Globally, investment in
energy R&D continues its current declining trend (EIA, 1997,
1999), and mechanisms for international diffusion of
technology and know-how remain weaker than in scenarios Al
and B1 (but higher than in A2), Some regions with rapid
economic development and limited natural resources place
particular emphasis on technology development and bilateral
cooperation. Technical change is therefore uneven. The energy
intensity of GDP declines at about 1% per year, in line with the
average historical experience since 1800.

"Energy systems differ from region to region, depending on the
availability of natural resources. The need to use energy and
other resources more efficiently spurs the development of less
carbon-intensive technology in some regions. Environment
policy cooperation at the regional level leads to success in the
management of some transboundary environmental problems,
such as acidification caused by sulfur dioxide (SO,), especially
to sustain regional self-reliance in agricultural production.
Regional cooperation also results in lower emissions of
nitrogen oxides (NO,) and volatile organic compounds
(VOCs), which reduce the incidence of elevated tropospheric
ozone levels. Although globally the energy system remains
predominantly hydrocarbon-based to 2100, a gradual transition
occurs away from the current share of fossil resources in world
energy supply, with a corresponding reduction in carbon
intensity.

describe similar global development patterns with respect to

"To achieve harmonization across six different modeling
approaches is not a trivial task. For example, most of the
models have different regional disaggregations, so that
harmonization at the level of the four SRES regions required
some “inverse” solutions, often achieved through iterative
model runs and adjustments of input assumptions. Also, in
some modeling frameworks the harmonized “input”
parameters are actually outputs of components of the modeling
framework (e.g., GDP as an output of economic general
equilibrium models, or final energy as an output variable after
considering endogenous energy prices and exogenously pre-
specified energy-intensity improvement rates). Therefore,
harmonization of important scenario driving-force inputs was
neither possible for all scenarios and for all participating
modeling teams, and nor was it judged desirable, as the
adoption of any harmonization criterion somewhat artificially
compresses uncertainty. This is also why simpler
harmonization criteria were adopted (see Section 4.2. above)
that focused on global population and GDP growth profiles.

illustrate different degrees of scenario uncertainty. The latter is
an important aspect, considering the different user
communities of SRES scenarios. Given the comparatively

AIT scenario group) scenarios are harmonized for population,
GDP and final energy (see Table 4-1). Also, 35 scenarios are
harmonized for population on the world level and 26 scenarios
are harmonized for global population and GDP (see Table 4-1).
The status of harmonization is also relatively stable to changes
in the harmonization criteria, For example, if the above
harmonization criteria were increased by 50% (i.e. GDP for the
four SRES regions may differ by up to +38% from the
respective GDP of the marker scenario), the sample of 11

suggested in the marker scenario quantification. The writing
team recognizes that this increases the number of scenarios as
well as complexity in the interpretation of results. These
additional scenarios are the result of the SRES terms of
reference of proceeding via an open process soliciting as wide
participation and viewpoints as possible and also serve the
purpose of highlighting important uncertainties of the future
that are necessarily compressed by limiting scenario
quantification to four illustrative marker scenarios. Thus, while
unharmonized scenarios illustrate the impact on GHG
emissions of expanding the uncertainty range of main scenario
drivers within any particular scenario family, the “globally
harmonized” scenarios indicate the range of GHG emissions
"	Text
"In the Al scenario family, the scenarios within one group were
also harmonized. In one Al scenario group the transition away
from conventional oil and gas either feads to a massive
development of unconventional oi! and gas resources (A1G) or
to a large-scale synfuel economy based on coal (ALC). Please
note that A1C and A1G were combined into one fossil
intensive group ALFI in the Summary for Policymakers during
its approval process (see also footnote 1). GHG emissions in
these scenarios approach emissions characteristic of the A2
scenario family (i.e. are much higher than in the case of the Al
marker scenario). In another Al scenario group, dwindling
conventional oil and gas resources lead to fast development of
post-fossil alternatives and enhanced energy conservation. In
this technology-intensive scenario group (ALT), energy
demands are lower than in the other Al scenario groups and,
because of radical technological change in energy systems,
GHG emissions are much lower than in the other Al scenario
groups (including the A1B marker scenario), approaching
those of the B1 scenario family.

"particular scenario storyline compared to the previous scenario
categories. In some cases, differences in interpretation relate to
uncertainties in rates of change — “other” scenarios yield
similar global demographic and economic outcomes by 2100
(e.g. the B2-ASF scenario compared to the B2 marker), but
illustrate different dynamics of how these could unfold. In
other cases, the “other” scenario category comprises scenario
quantifications that deliberately explore alternative
interpretations of a scenario storyline in terms of global
population and GDP growth altogether (e.g. in the A2-Al-
MiniCAM scenario). The reason is to indicate that quantitative
scenario descriptions entail a high degree of uncertainty (and
subjectivity from different modeling teams) when it comes to
interpret the four different qualitative SRES scenario storylines
and to translate them into the quantitative assumptions that
drive emission models. When comparing GHG emissions
results for the four SRES marker scenarios (see Chapter 5)
with those of the other SRES scenarios, it is illustrative to
distinguish the effects of different model methodologies and
parametrizations from variations of important scenario drivers
that often serve as exogenous input to models.

"The first group of Al scenarios, which includes the A1B

"	Text
"scenario drivers, such as population and economic growth,
technological change, resource availability, land-use changes,
and local and regional environmental policies, are summarized
in this Section (GHG emissions are reported in detail in
Chapter 5). The assumptions are based on the range of driving
forces identified in Chapter 2 and their relationships as
summarized in Chapter 3. For simplicity these drivers are
presented separately, but it is important to keep in mind that the
evolution of these scenario drivers is to a large extent
interrelated, as reflected in the SRES scenarios.
"	Text
"An affluent world, with a rapid demographic transition
(declining mortality and fertility rates) and an
increasing degree of international development equity.
Very high productivity and economic growth in all
regions, with a considerable catch-up of developing
countries.

Comparatively high energy and materials demands,
moderated however by continuous structural change
and the diffusion of more efficient technologies,
consistent with the high productivity growth and capital
turnover rates of the scenario.
"	List
"Each scenario family is illustrated by a designated marker
scenario. A marker is not necessarily the mean or mode of
comparable scenario quantifications, nor would it be possible
to construct an internally consistent scenario reflecting
medians/modes of all salient scenario characteristics (both in
terms of scenario input assumptions as well as scenario
outcomes, i.e. emissions). Marker scenarios should also not be
interpreted as being the more likely alternative scenario
quantifications. However, only the four marker scenarios were
subjected to the SRES open process through the SRES website
and they have also received closest scrutiny by the entire
writing team.
"	Text
"As discussed above, the SRES scenarios were designed to
reflect inherent uncertainties of future developments by
adopting a range of salient input assumptions, but without
attempting to cover the extremes from the scenario literature.
Given the nature of the SRES open process and its multi-model
approach, as well as the need for documented input
assumptions, published scenario extremes are difficult to
reproduce using alternative model approaches or insufficiently
documented input data. (For instance, many long-term
emission scenarios do not report their underlying population
assumptions (see Chapters 2 and 3), which is especially true for
extreme scenarios that are usually performed within the
context of model sensitivity analysis.)
"	Text
"The main aspects of translating the storylines into scenario
drivers are summarized below. For each scenario family an
overview of all scenario quantifications is given. Scenarios that
share harmonized input assumptions with the respective
scenario marker in terms of global population and GDP
profiles (see Tables 4-1 and 4-3) are indicated in italics in the
subsequent discussion. Altogether, 26 scenarios in the four
scenario families share similar assumptions about population
and GDP at the global level. The other 14 scenarios either do
not fully comply with the agreed common input assumptions
conceming global population and GDP or explore important
sensitivities of future demographic and economic developments
beyond that described in the 24 scenarios. These sensitivities
include resource availability, technology development, or land-
use changes and describe similar demographic and economic
development patterns as other scenarios within a family, even
if they do not fall within the range suggested by the
harmonization criteria (see Table 4-1). Combined, the SRES
scenario set comprises 40 scenarios grouped into four scenario
families and different scenario groups (see Table 4-3).
"	Text
"Compared to the previous 1S92 scenario series there are
important similarities, but also important differences. For
instance, three different future population scenarios were
adopted, albeit that the future population levels are somewhat
lower and the range more compressed than those in [S92 this
reflects advances in demographic modeling and population
projections. Conversely, the range of assumptions that concern
resource availability and future technological change is much
wider compared to earlier scenarios, reflecting in particular the
results of the IPCC WGII Second Assessment Report (SAR;
Watson et al., 1996). Another distinguishing characteristic of
the SRES scenarios is an attempt to reflect the most recent
understanding on the relationships between important scenario
driving-force variables. For instance, no scenario combines
low fertility with high mortality assumptions, which reflects
the consensus view from demographers (see Chapter 3).
Equally, al! SRES scenarios assume a qualitative relationship
between demographics and social and economic development
trends, which reflects both the literature (see Chapter 3) and the
results of the evaluation of the [S92 scenario series (Alcamo et
al., 1995). All else being equal, fertility and mortality trends
are thus lower in scenarios with high-income growth
assumptions, but the multidimensionality of the causal
linkages must be recognized and so no particular cause-effect
model is postulated here. Finally, the scenarios also attempt to
reflect recent advances (as reviewed in Chapter 3) in
understanding of the evolution of macro-economic and
material productivity (e.g., their coupling via capital turnover
rates), uncertainties in future levels of “dematerialization”
(reflected in the difference between the B1 and A1 scenarios),
and the likely evolution of local and regional environmental
policies (e.g., all scenarios assume various degrees of sulfur-
control policies).

"® Different modeling teams provided different interpretations of what
such a “balanced” resource-technology portfolio could be in the 21%
century. The assumed rapid technology dynamics that underlie the Al
scenario storyline necessitate that technologies and resource
exploitation profiles change significantly. Hence, the concept of
“balanced” development does not necessarily apply to any particular
future date, but rather to the entirety of the scenario’s development
path throughout the 21"" century. As a consequence of the slow
turnover rates in the capital stock of the energy sector, all scenarios
necessarily rely more heavily on currently dominant resources and
technologies in the near-term and project more radical departures only
in the long-term.

"“Balanced” Al scenarios quantifications were also calculated
by the models’ A/B-ASF, AlB-IMAGE, A1B-MARIA, AIB-

integrated set of energy-sector simulation and optimization
models used to generate the IASA-WEC long-term energy

al., 1998). Compared to the other storylines (Al and B1), the
B2 future unfolds with more gradual changes and less extreme
developments in all respects, including geopolitics,
demographics, productivity growth, technological dynamics,
and other salient scenario characteristics. A more fragmented
pattern of future development (not that different from present
trends) precludes any particularly strong convergence
tendencies in the scenario quantification:

"High economic growth in all regions, with significant
catch-up in the presently less-developed regions that
leads to a substantial reduction in present income
disparities,

Comparatively small increase in energy demand

saturation of material- and energy-intensive activities
(e.g., car ownership), and effective innovation and
implementation of measures to improve energy
efficiency.

Timely and effective development of non-fossil energy
supply options in response to the desire for a clean local
and regional environment and to the gradual depletion
of conventional oil and gas supplies.

"The low range of future CO, emissions from the
literature is not reflected in the SRES scenarios,
consistent with the SRES Terms of Reference to
consider only scenarios that assume no “additional
climate policy initiatives” (see Appendix I).

The low end of the range of global GDP and energy use
from the literature is equally not reflected in the SRES
scenarios. Very low global GDP values arise from a
combination of rapid demographic transition with low
per capita productivity growth, a combination for
which there is little theoretic or empiric support in the
available literature on demographic and economic
growth reviewed in Chapter 3. Low GDP scenarios can
also reflect a combination of average population growth
and low economic growth; this type of future usually
depicts low-income, inequitable, and possibly unstable

for Policymakers at the 5th Session of WGIII of the IPCC from 8-11

growth and its uncertainty lies primarily in the developing
countries. An equally pervasive trend across all scenarios is
urbanization (see Chapter 3). Since the population trajectories
are exogenous input to all the models used for this report, and
are subject to a stringent harmonization criterion across
different models, no further demographic variants to these are
reported here, with exception of the A2 scenario family.'®
"	Text
"For the SRES scenario quantification three different population
trajectories were chosen to reflect future demographic
uncertainties based on published population projections (Lutz,
1996; UN, 1998; see Chapter 3). Global population ranges
between 7 and 15 billion people by 2100 (Figure 4-5)
depending on the speed and extent of the demographic
transition. Fertility rates were assumed to converge to
replacement levels (UN, 1998 medium scenario) in the B2
scenario or to below replacement levels in the Al and B1
scenario families that adopt a variant of the low population
scenario of Lutz (1996). The A2 scenario family is based on the
high population projection described in Lutz (1996), which is
characterized by heterogeneous fertility patterns that remain
above replacement levels in many regions but nonetheless
decline compared to current levels.
"	Text
"The population trajectory assumed for the Al and B1 scenario
families is based on a variant of the low population projection
reported in Lutz (1996), which combines low fertility with low
mortality and central migration rate assumptions. As is the case
for other population scenarios used in this report, it is well
within the uncertainty ranges as discussed in the demographic
literature and the UN (1998) long-range population
projections. After peaking at 8.7 billion in the middle of the
21 century, world population declines to 7.1 billion in the year
2100 (for comparison, the lowest UN Long Range projection
indicates 5.6 billion by 2100; UN, 1998). As discussed in
Chapter 3, the scenario population is somewhat higher than the
previous low population scenario used in the [S92 scenario
series, as only a combination of low fertility with high
mortality rates could result in a global population as low as six
billion people by 2100. Such a development is judged to be
inconsistent with demographic theory (see Chapter 3) and to be
inconsistent with the scenario storylines (see Section 4.2).
"	Text
"The pace of demographic transition in developing countries is
fastest among all the SRES scenarios, reflecting the emphasis
on social and educational development (scenario B1) and
economic development (A1). The use of the same population
projection for two SRES scenario families thus reflects
different views of the driving forces of the demographic
transition (with causality links in both directions), but it does
not imply that such a demographic scenario is considered more
likely compared to that of other projections. Better education
and unproved social development, in particular concerning the
role of women in society, lead the demographic transition (and
consequently also, economic development) in scenario B1.
Accelerated rates of economic development and its required
favorable social environment (education, reduction of income
disparities, etc.) in turn lead the demographic transition in
scenario Al. In both scenarios, low (infant) mortality rates are
a necessary precondition to lower fertility rates (consistent
with the Cairo targets of the UN Conference on Population and
Development, discussed in Chapter 2). A distinguishing feature
of the ASA low population projection is the assumption of
below replacement fertility levels, on the basis of the actual
experience of industrial countries.'’ The implications of this
trend are visible in both the absolute decline of global
population (from its peak at 8.7 billion people in the middle of

"approximately equal intervals. Two distinguishing features
characterize the SRES scenarios. First, probabilities or
likelihood are not assigned to any quantitative scenario
characteristics (inputs or outputs). Thus, that two of the SRES
marker scenarios deploy the same (low) demographic
projection does not imply that such a scenario is considered
more likely. It only indicates that such a demographic scenario
was judged by the SRES writing team to be consistent with two
of the four SRES storylines, as opposed to arbitrarily assigning
different population projections to other “high” or “low”
scenario characteristics. Second, the SRES scenarios
incorporate current understanding of important interrelations
between various scenario-driving forces (see Chapter 3). Thus,
a “free,” or “modeler’s choice,” numeric combination of
scenario indicators is simply not possible. For instance,
intermediary levels of global GDP or energy use could result
both from a medium population projection combined with
intermediate per capita GDP or energy use growth, or
alternatively from low or high population projections
combined with high or low GDP and energy per capita values,
respectively. The fact that for some quantitative scenario
characteristics a number of SRES marker scenarios cluster
more toward the upper or lower range spanned by the scenario
literature merely indicates the existence of important
relationships between scenario characteristics. It also indicates
that a limited number of scenarios (four markers) cannot
replicate the distribution of individual scenario values arising
out of an analysis of more than 400 scenarios published in the
literature'5, Hence, it is important to consider always the entire
range across all 40 SRES scenarios when analyzing
uncertainties in all driving-force variables and the resultant
emission categories.

"2050, it 1s necessary to consider the corresponding UN long-range
population projections that extend to 2150 (UN, 1998). In these. the
corresponding high/medium scenario 1s projected to have 10.8 billion
people by 2050, which mcreases to 14.6 billion by 2100, The UN presents
two additional scenarios that result in yet higher population levels: the UN
high scenario projects 11.2 billion people by 2050 and 17.5 billion by
2100, and the UN constant fertility scenario projects 14.9 and 57.2 billion
people by 2050 and 2100, 1espectively. For comparison, the A2 population
scenario adopted from Lutz et al (1996) indicates population levels of
11.3 billion by 2050 and 15.1 billion by 2100. Thus, A2 population levels
by 2050 are comparable to those of the UN high scenario but 1emain
significantly below the UN constant fertility scenario. By 2100, A2’s
population assumption is comparable to that of the UN high/medium
scenario (14.6 billion) and significantly below that of the other two UN
scenarios (high and constant fertility, with 17.5 and 57.2 billion,
respectively). Hence, the adopted values for the A2 scenario are well
within the range of the UN long-range population projections. As
discussed in Chapter 3, the reason for the comparatively higher 2050
population in the Lutz et a/ (1996) scenario is lower assumed mortality
rates compared to the UN projections in the medium/high scenario. The
lower mortality rates characteristic of A2’s demographic scenario are
judged to be more consistent with the A2 scenano storyline than
alternative UN projections, such as the UN high/medium variant, that
1esulis in lower population by 2050, albeit at the expense of higher
mortality. Yet by 2100 the differences in global population between the
two scenarios 1s rather small (15. versus 14.6 billion, or 3%).

the REF region as compared with the marker, 405 million
versus 706 million in the marker. An alternative demographic
interpretation at the global level was attempted in the
“transitional” A2-Al-MiniCAM scenario, in which the

"Uncertainties in future GDP levels are governed by the rates of
future productivity growth and population growth, especially
those in developing countries, Different assumptions on
conditions and possibilities for development “catch-up” and
for narrower per capita income gaps in particular explain the
wide range in projected future economic growth rates. Given
the weak inverse relationship between population growth and
per capita income growth discussed in Chapter 2, uncertainties
in future population growth rates tend to restrict the range of
associated GDP projections. High population growth, all else
being equal, lowers per capita income growth, whereas low
population growth tends to increase this growth. This
relationship is evident in empiric data ~— high per capita income
countries are generally also those that have completed their
demographic transition. The affluent live long and generally
have few children. Notable exceptions are countries with small
populations and significant income from commodity exports.
Yet even assuming this relationship holds for an extended time
into the future, its quantification is subject to considerable
theoretic and empiric uncertainties (Alcamo et al., 1995).

"corresponding uncertainties estimated by demographers (see
Chapter 3). For instance, Lutz et al. (1997) attach a probability
of about 90% that actual world population will be lower (and
10% that it will be higher) than the value adopted for the A2
scenario family. Thus, the scenario represents well an upper
bound of population growth scenarios found in the current
scenario literature, although higher population scenarios exist
in the demographic literature (see Chapter 3). As mentioned
above, the SRES writing team is not in a position to attach any
judgment concerning probability or likelihood to this or to any
other demographic scenario. Population growth in the A2
world remains uninterrupted across all the SRES regions
(Figure 4-5). The average global population growth rate over
the 21% century is 0.96% per year, half that observed during the
period between 1950 and 1990 (1.86%; UN, 1998). In the A2
marker, fertility rates vary considerably from one region to
another; this reflects the regional orientation toward specific
values, lifestyles, etc. described in the A2 scenario storyline
(see Section 4.3). In the A2 world, in the year 2100 less than
one-tenth of the world population lives in OECD90 countries,
and toward the end of the 21 century a pronounced shift
occurs in the population distribution, from ASIA to the ALM

"Historical data indicate that, even though the process of
economic growth is heterogeneous across countries and over
time, the patterns of growth show certain similarities.
Economic “catch-up” follows a general dynamic pattern,
characterized by initially accelerating economic growth rates
that pass through a maximum, and decline once the industrial
base of an economy becomes established. This overall feature
of growth dynamics is reflected in all the SRES scenarios,
albeit timing and magnitude vary across the four scenario
families. This variation reflects the scenario-specific storylines,

differences in regional definitions are accounted for, 1990
regional GDP differences between models range up to 32% in
a few cases. Such differences are particularly pronounced for
developing countries, where in many cases national currencies
are not freely convertible and thus important uncertainties on
the applicable conversion rates remain (World Bank, 1999).
Differences for OECD countries are much smaller (3% across

1990 in terms of the GDP/capita difference between current
developed (IND) and developing (DEV) regions across the four
SRES regions. However, even if relative income differences are
reduced drastically, absolute differences remain large, not least
because of the high incomes characteristic of the Al scenario
family (per capita income differences are also larger when
considered at a more disaggregated level). When measured
across the four SRES regions in 1990, income per capita
differences are nearly 1:40 (between ASIA and OECD90), Per
capita income differences are yet higher for differences across
countries or between different social strata. The poorest 20% of
Bangladesh’s population, for instance, earn per capita incomes
that are a factor of 700 lower than that of the 20% richest Swiss
population (UNDP, 1993). A distinguishing feature of the Al
scenarios is to explore pathways of reductions in present
disparities. In Al, per capita income in industrial countries
(IND) increases to about US$107,300 and in now developing

"As compared to the other SRES scenario families, the A2
world is characterized by relatively slower productivity growth
rates and resultant lower per capita incomes (see Table 4-6).
Yet, the global average (1990-2100) growth rate in per capita
income of 1.3% is still somewhat higher than that observed
from 1970 to 1995 (1.2%; World Bank, 1998), The
comparatively conservative assumptions on per-capita-income
growth reflect both the more fragmented economic outlook of
the A2 storyline (see Section 4.3) and the slow pace of the
demographic transition that underlies A2’s high population
growth trajectory. The fastest growth in per capita incomes (on
average over 2.3% per yeat) occurs in the ASIA region, while
the slowest growth is observed in the OECD90 region (on
average 1.0% per year). In a reversal of current short-term
trends, the REF and ALM regions experience a stable increase
of their per capita income levels over the 21 century at a rate
that is almost twice as high as in the OECD90 region (see Table
4-7), The A2 world is also characterized by a slow convergence
of incomes among regions. Nonetheless, present income
disparities become narrower, from a factor of 40 difference in
1990 per capita income levels between the richest and the
poorest of the four SRES regions, to a factor of seven or eight
by 2100. The increase of global population from 6 to 15 billion
by 2100 translates into an increase of global GDP by a factor
of 12 over a century. The average (1990 to 2100) annual growth
rate of total GDP is 2.2%, which is lower than the 2.9%

here. Its corresponding implications on scenario quantifications are discussed with one example in Box 4-6.

"Productivity assumptions are not comparable across the different models used to quantify the SRES emissions scenarios, so
these issues were examined by running quantifications of the SRES scenarios with the MiniCAM model. Population projections
were taken as exogenous inputs and regional GDP growth paths were taken to be similar to those in the SRES marker scenarios.
From these, the implied labor force productivity growth rates are determined using assumptions about labor force participation
rates. In these calculations, total labor force participation rates were assumed to be asymptotic to a Participation rate of 80% for
a working age population of all persons aged 15 to 65.

"At the upper end of the these ranges, the SRES scenarios exhibit a growth in global labor force productivity that is higher than
recent historical global experience, particularly for the SRES regions REF and ALM. This indicates that none of the four SRES
scenario families envisions a recurrence of the current economic crisis in Eastern Europe and Russia or a recurrence of the “lost
decade” of negative GDP per capita growth in Africa or Latin America. In addition, the period over which some developing
regions exhibit high growth rates in these scenarios is longer than any historical record of high growth rates. However, there is
limited analogous historical experience, as Japan is the only country that can be said to have completed such an economic
“catch-up.”

"The assumptions on labor force participation used in the calculations reported in this box result in a decline in the growth of
the labor force through the 21% century. The total labor force actually declines in all regions for the last simulation period. This
reflects the demographic pattern of an overall decline in the population and the assumed stability in labor force participation
rates. However, the scenarios describe generally affluent worlds in which people live longer. Thus, the labor participation
patterns are likely to change with respect to current practices. People may work much longer over their lifetime, but this trend
is countered by the probable need for an increase in education levels, which act to delay entry into the labor force. Pushing the
asymptotic labor participation rates upward from the value assumed here results in only a small increase in total productivity,
on the order of 0.2% per year.

"The high economic growth branches (Al and B1 families) of the SRES scenarios may represent upper bounds for future
increases in labor productivity. Different assumptions about future rates of labor force participation do not appear to change this
conclusion substantially. These scenarios essentially assume that, within the next few decades, most developing regions will
experience an extended period of successful economic development analogous to the historical experience of Japan and the
“Asian Tigers.” An alternative view on future labor productivity growth is provided in a number of scenarios developed with the
MiniCAM model, most notably Alv2-MiniCAM and the “transitional” scenario A2-A1-MiniCAM (see Box 4-6). In these
scenarios global economic output is between 20% (A2-Al-MiniCAM) and 36% (Alv2-MiniCAM) lower than in the other
scenarios of their respective scenario families.

"The result of this exercise is that increases in labor force productivity range between 0.79% and 5.85% per year (calculated for

considered separately. This compares with historical experience between 1970 and 1995 of growth in regional labor force
productivity of 0.69 to 4.13% per year and the longer-term productivity growth rates of between 1.1 and 7.7% per year. The
implied future growth in global labor productivity for the MiniCAM scenario calculations ranges between 1.12% and 3.49%
per year for the four scenarios (again from 1990 to 2020, 2020 to 2050, and 2050 to 2100). The historical growth in global labor

increases in the efficiency with which services are provided, this results in a global average level of energy services similar to
that currently seen in Western Europe. Global per capita income and energy use by 2100 approach that of Western Europe in

Land-use changes do not offset any of these emissions, since the relatively high population, the rapid growth in income, and the
growth in modern biomass result in essentially zero carbon emissions from land use and agriculture, rather than the substantial
uptake seen in many other scenarios.

the lower end of the historical data base range. In such a relatively poor world the economic structure is more sensitive to
environmental change than in the marker scenario, and the institutional structure is less capable. Thus, the impacts of climate
change are larger and the ability to adapt less than those in the Al world. The primary driving forces for the A2-A1-MiniCAM

structural changes in energy supply options (see Sections 4.4.6
and 4.4.7), Energy prices are also strongly affected by policies
(e.g., taxation), but to project these far into the future is both
outside the capability of currently available methodologies and
outside the general “policy neutral” stance of the SRES
scenarios. Therefore, most models treat dynamic changes in
(average and marginal) costs as the driving force for energy
intensity improvements and for technology choice (see
Sections 4.4.6 and 4.4.7).

"Improvements in energy efficiency on the demand side are
assumed to be relatively low in the A1B marker scenario,
because of low energy prices caused by rapid technological
progress in resource availability and energy supply technologies
(see Sections 4.4.6 and 4.4.7). These low energy prices provide
little incentive to improve end-use-energy efficiencies and high
income levels encourage comfortable and convenient(and often
energy intensive) lifestyles (especially in the household, service,
and transport sectors). Efficient technologies are not fully
introduced into the end-use side, dematerialization processes in
the industrial sector are not well promoted, lifestyles become
energy intensive, and private motor vehicles are used more in
developing countries as per capita GDP increases. Conversely,
fast rates of economic growth and capital turnover and rising
incomes also enable the diffusion of more efficient technologies

"In the Al and B1 scenarios, per capita income differences are
substantially narrowed and convergent because of increased
economic integration and rapid technological change.
Therefore, differences in energy intensities are also narrowed
significantly and are convergent, as shown in Figure 4.6. The
Bl storyline describes a development path to a less material-
intensive economy. Hence, the final energy intensities in the B1
marker are lowest among the four SRES marker scenarios for
a given per capita income level. The A2 storyline reflects a
world with less rapid technological change, as shown by the
smallest rate of energy intensity improvement among the four
marker scenarios.25 Different interpretations of the four
scenario storylines, as well as alternative rates of energy
intensity improvement to the four marker scenarios, are
discussed below.

"Figure 4-6 illustrates the evolution of final energy intensities
for the four SRES marker scenarios. Instead of time, per capita
income is shown on the horizontal axis, to illustrate a
conditional convergence of regional final energy intensities.
Invariably, intensities are projected to decline with increasing
income levels. As discussed in Chapter 3, the main reason for
this tend stems from the common source of economic growth
and energy intensity improvements — technological change.
All else being equal, the faster intensity improvements are, the
faster aggregate productivity (per capita income) grows. An
important methodologic improvement over previous studies is
the explicit inclusion of non-commercial energy forms in
some SRES models, drawing on estimates as reported in IPCC
WGIL SAR (Watson er al., 1996) and in Naki¢enovié er al.

factors, from inevitable elements of speculation to geopolitical considerations, all of which can decouple energy price trends
from any underlying physical balance between supply and demand. Taxes are especially significant. In a number of OECD
countries, up to 80% of the consumer price of gasoline is taxes (OECD, 1998), and the differences between countries are
enormous. In 1997, 27% of the price of gasoline in the USA was taxes, compared with 78% in France. Taxes vary substantially
even between large oil producers (and exporters). In Mexico taxes are 13% of gasoline prices, but in Norway they are 75%

"The six models used for SRES range from detailed “bottom-up” models (e.g., AIM, IMAGE), through macro-economic (partial
equilibrium) models (e.g., MARIA, MiniCAM), to hybrid approaches (successive iteration between the engineering model
MESSAGE with a macro-economic model, or using the Worldscan model with IMAGE). Each has different representations of
price formation mechanisms and their relationship to macro-economic or sectoral energy demand. These are summarized in
Appendix IV. As a rule, “bottom-up” (optimization) models calculate only (average and marginal) costs endogenously. As a
result of their sectoral perspective (energy, agriculture, etc.), these models cannot determine macro-economic feedbacks on other
sectors or the entire economy and thus are unable to represent a consistent picture of price formation. Conversely, price
formation is endogenized in “top-down” models; however, these rely on the stringent assumption that demand and supply must
be in equilibrium and in addition provide little sectoral detail. Over recent years this simplified modeling dichotomy has
progressively weakened because of further advances in methodology and the development of “hybrid” modeling approaches. To
illustrate the methodologies deployed in the six SRES models, two (MARIA and MESSAGE) are discussed here, but (for space
limitations) only in terms of one scenario (B2). (Table 4-9 gives additional details of an inter-scenario comparison of energy
prices for the MiniCAM and ASF models. Owing to methodologic differences, a comparison of prices across scenarios is only
possible within a consistent approach (i.e. be comparing scenarios quantified with the same model).)
"	Text
"The energy prices represented in MARIA (see also Mori, 2000) consist of energy production and energy utilization costs. Market
prices are determined endogenously by model-calculated shadow prices (for further model details see Appendix IV and Mori
and Takahashi, 1999), Among various parameters, the extraction costs of fossil fuel resources and the coefficients of utilization
costs and their evolution over time are the most important determinants. For the MARIA runs, the resource estimates of Rogner
(1997) were used as input. For the sake of simplicity, all fossil resource categories of Rogner (1997) were aggregated into two
classes and a quadratic production function was used to interpolate the extraction costs of reserves and all other occurrences.
For coal, long-term extraction costs range up to US$6.3 per GJ in 1990US$ prices, for gas up to US$25 per GJ, and for oil up
to US$28 per GJ (see Appendix IV for further details). The energy cost coefficients (representing 16 different energy conversion
technologies) are based on Manne and Richels (1992). For the B2 scenario quantification, the Manne and Richels (1992)
estimates were largely retained. For instance, electricity generation costs range between 14 mills?6/kWh for gas to 51 mills/kWh
for coal. (For the other scenario quantifications these cost values were modified to conform to the different interpretations of a
particular scenario storyline.) Together these assumptions determined long-run costs and shadow prices that were set equal to
energy prices in the macro-economic production function of MARIA. The energy prices were combined with assumed (low)
AEEI values and potential GDP growth rates (the latter from the B2 marker) to calculate the resultant aggregate energy demand
in the model. The resultant primary energy demand was (with exception of the REF region) within 15% of the respective B2
marker quantification at the regional level and within 5% of global energy demand. As a result of different model structures,
comparable price data for the MESSAGE model are only available for internationally traded primary energy forms (these are

"The bottom-up, systems engineering (optimization) model MESSAGE does not compute energy prices. Instead, the model is
entirely based on cost information, but such costs are treated as dynamic. Their overall treatment follows the lines outlined
above for the MARIA model, except that greater technology-specific detail is contained in the model. Altogether 19 different
fossil resource grades are differentiated, based on the estimates of Rogner (1997). The resultant (levelized) extraction costs for
the B2 marker are in the range US$1.1 to US$5.4 per GJ for coal, US$1.2 to US$5.3 per GJ for oil, and US$1.2 to US$5.7 per
GJ for gas (range indicates costs variations between lowest and highest costs of the four SRES regions for 2020, 2050, and 2100
respectively, see Appendix IV). Technology-specific cost assumptions cannot be summarized here as MESSAGE contains
literally hundreds of energy supply and end-use technologies. Examples of cost assumptions are given in Section 4.4.7 and more
detail is reported in Riahi and Roehrl (2000). However, as in MARIA, MESSAGE also calculates shadow prices for
internationally traded primary energy forms and therefore these two indicators can be compared (Table 4-8).
"	Text
"To achieve consistency between model-calculated energy cost dynamics and energy demand assumptions an iterative modeling
procedure between MESSAGE and MACRO (a macro-economic production function model based on Manne and Richels,
1992) was used, on the basis of model-calculated shadow prices as indicators of future price dynamics. The methodology is
described in more detail in Wene (1996). This approach requires time-intensive model iterations, but has the advantage that the
impact of price increases can be separated from efficiency improvements through fuel substitution (e.g., a gas-fired cook stove
energy end-use efficiency is up to 10 times higher than a traditional cook stove fired with fuelwood) as well as from “everything
else,” i.e., the AEE] in the traditional sense). Aggregated, the impact of (shadow) price increases in MESSAGE’s B2 scenario
accounts for 8% of global primary energy demand by 2020, 23% by 2050, and 30% by 2100. This impact is calculated as a
reduction in energy demand compared to a hypothetical scenario with constant 1990 prices (and correspondingly higher energy
demand). The impact of price increases on future energy demand in the B2 scenario is thus relatively smail compared to that of
other factors, although far from negligible. This also explains why the two B2 scenario quantifications by MARIA and
MESSAGE have quite similar energy demand figures, even if international trade prices may differ. First, trade prices are only
one component of the cost-price mechanism treated in the models (which also includes domestic energy production,
conversion, and end-use costs). Second, models differ in their parametrizations of the “everything else” (AEEI) model
parameters, for which a wide range of views on applicable ranges exists. Therefore it is one of the model calibration parameters

frequently used to replicate existing scenarios or to standardize inter-model comparison projects such as EMF-14 (Weyant,

by 2100 differences in energy intensities across models
become much smaller. An interesting set of scenarios was

host of new energy end-use technologies (e.g., microturbines,

energy use in the Alvl-MiniCAM and Alv2-MiniCAM
scenarios reaches about 60% only of the final energy use
described in the Al marker. However, both scenarios describe
very different worlds with respect to economic growth but
share the assumption of saturating per capita energy use at
levels of 150 GJ/capita. All else being equal, scenarios of lower
GDP per capita growth (e.g. Alv2-MiniCAM) generally also
assume lower improvement rates in energy intensity, consistent
with the literature (as discussed in Chapter 3). Generally, the

and 2100). The final energy demand across regions is
determined by the product of regional GDP growth and energy
intensity improvements. For example, the higher energy
intensities in ASIA compared to the ALM region lead to a
higher absolute final energy demand in the former in spite of a
lower GDP. This is explained by differences in initial
conditions and by delayed diffusion of more efficient energy
end-use technologies, because of lower GDP per capita growth.

"The global primary energy use and final energy use in the A2
scenarios created with the AIM, MESSAGE, and MiniCAM
models are quite close to those of the marker scenario, while
A2-IMAGE scenario projects lower primary and final energy
use compared to the A2 marker. As mentioned above, the A2-
Al-MiniCAM scenario explores a very different unfolding of
driving forces in terms of population and GDP growth,
combined with an assumption about saturating energy demand
at current Western European levels. Combined, these
assumptions translate into the lowest energy intensity
improvement rates across the SRES scenario set. Global
primary energy use per unit of GDP (intensities) improves
from 14.7 MJ/US$90 in 1990 to 8.9 MJ/US$90 in 2100. This
reflects mainly the low per capita GDP (productivity) growth
of this scenario which (other factors being equal) translates
into low rates of energy intensity improvement. Nonetheless,
the resultant energy intensities are comparable to current
Western European levels, as are income and energy use per
capita. In other words, the scenario describes a global picture
by 2100 quite similar to that of Western Europe of today, 100
years earlier.

"Energy intensity improvements in the B1 marker result from
energy efficiency investments brought about by increases in
fuel and electricity prices and technological innovations
(including assumptions on taxes and perceived premium values
for clean fuels). The rather high rates in energy intensity
reduction in B1 stem also from the explicit assumption that less
industrialized regions catch-up. Another factor is the
assumption that monetary economic growth in less developed
regions initially largely replaces activities in the informal
economy, which leads to a replacement of traditional non-
commercial energy forms by high-efficiency modern
applications and fuels - and hence substantial energy intensity
improvements. In the developed regions the high economic
growth in the B1 scenario may, for instance, be in the form of
increasing monetization of human activities previously not
included in GDP accounts (e.g., childcare, household work).
Such monetary GDP growth does not result in additional
demands for energy services, and hence again results in
significant energy intensity improvements. The demand for
electricity is assumed to rise faster than that for non-electricity
energy, and may pose one of the capital availability constraints
in this scenario.
"	Text
"Final energy demand for the B2 marker was derived by
applying efficiencies of end-use technologies to the demand of
electric and non-electric energy services. These in turn depend
on the economic development rates, income levels, and
sectoral economic structure of each region. The evolution of
the final energy demand levels and structure in the developing
regions follows patterns that are similar to the historical
development in the now-industrialized regions of the world.
This again is consistent with the “dynamics-as-usual”
interpretation of the B2 storyline. By successive iterations with
a macro-economic model, marginal cost increases are taken
into account in the energy demand projections of the
MESSAGE model for the B2 marker (see Appendix IV). The
result is an aggregate energy-intensity improvement rate at the
global level of about 1% per year until 2100, about the same as
has prevailed over the past 100 years in countries for which
such long-term time series data are available (see Chapter 3).
This aggregate global improvement rate masks important
differences in the temporal and spatial evolution of energy
intensities. Improvements are generally higher in regions far
away from the energy-intensity frontier and also faster in those
for which the capital turnover rate (i.e., GDP growth) is higher.
Consistent with the more imperfect realization of future trends
characteristic of the B2 scenario, energy intensity
improvements are slower than in the Al or BI scenario
families, but higher than in the A2 scenario family.

"Various alternative scenario quantifications were developed for
BI by the modeling teams. For the first four to five decades
most model runs show a global final energy use within the
proposed bounds of the B1 marker, except B1-ASF which is
higher. By 2100 most scenarios assume higher final energy use
than the marker run, except B1-MESSAGE which reproduces
closely the final energy use of the Bl marker (and is
correspondingly classified as a “fully harmonized” scenario).
In particular, BI1-MARIA, B1High-MiniCAM, and B1High-
MESSAGE show a global final energy use in 2100 nearly twice
that of the marker. These scenarios explored the implications
for energy demand of less rapid “dematerialization” tendencies
of the economy, especially for developing countries, with
trends in line with historical energy intensity experiences in the
OECD countries. Regional trends differ most dramatically for
the MiniCAM and MARIA runs for ASIA and ALM, with the
MiniCAM simulations assuming a saturating (converging)
energy use on a per capita basis at 125 GJ/capita. However,
current knowledge about rates and direction of demateriali-
zation of economic activities is limited. Therefore, both
historical OECD trends and their applicability to the future
economies of currently developing countries may not
necessarily reflect future developments. The use of alternative
modeling approaches in the quantification of the B1 scenario
storyline has helped to shed light on this important area of
uncertainty of the future.

the storylines and the higher income levels of Al and B1, this
change in final energy structure is faster in these scenario

"The energy intensity and resultant global growth in final
energy demand of the B2 marker is matched reasonably well
by other scenario quantifications until about 2050; the B2-AIM
scenario shares “fully harmonized” input assumptions at the
global and regional levels alike over the entire time horizon. By
2100, however, differences become larger, and in particular the
two MiniCAM scenarios show lower final energy intensity
improvements compared to the B2 marker and other B2
scenarios. The MiniCAM scenarios were developed to explore
high-end sensitivities for GHG emissions in the B2 scenario
family by assuming higher energy demand, combined with a
high reliance on coal in the B2High-MiniCAM scenario.
Different scenarios at the regional level illustrate alternative
interpretations, with particularly large variations in the REF

lower energy use in REF (e.g., B2-IMAGE) and up to 50%
higher energy use in ALM (B2-MiniCAM, B2High-
MiniCAM) compared to the B2 marker. The alternative
scenarios illustrate that uncertainties in future energy
intensities and resultant final energy demand are generally
larger for developing and transition economies compared to the
OECD90 region. Among other reasons, this is a function of the
much higher uncertainties with respect to future economic
growth rates in these regions.

other factors such as safety and risk considerations for nuclear
power generation. Generally, absolute resource constraints do
not become binding in the marker scenarios or other scenarios.
The contribution of these resources is substantially below the
physical flows identified in Section 3.4, and therefore results
mainly from  scenario-specific assumptions concerning
technology availability, performance, and costs. These are
summatized in Section 4.4.7.

"Their complex interplay results in scenarios of future
cumulative resource use being the most appropriate indicator,
as opposed to exogenously pre-specified resource-base
constraints, especially in view of the multi-model approach
adopted to develop the SRES scenarios. Table 4-10 and Figures
4-8 to 4-10 summarize the results for the four SRES marker
scenarios and of the ensemble of SRES scenarios for their
respective scenario families and scenario groups (in the case of
the Al scenario family). It is evident that, in the absence of
climate policies, none of the SRES scenarios depicts a
premature end to the fossil-fuel age. Invariably, cumulative
fossil-fuel use to 2050 (not to mention 2100) exceeds the
quantities of fossil fuels extracted since the onset of the
Industrial Revolution, even though the “call on” fossil
resources differs significantly across the four marker scenarios.
This increase is higher in the scenarios that explore a wider
domain of uncertainty on future fossil-resource availability.

"Energy resources are taken to be plentiful by assuming a large
future availability of coal, unconventional oil, and gas as well
as high levels of improvement in the efficiency of energy
exploitation technologies, energy conversion technologies, and
transport technologies. The grades of energy resources used in
the model differ on the basis of extraction costs. When
combined with the level of improvement in efficiency of
exploitation technology (expressed as the rate of improvement
in marginal production costs), the graded costs of energy-
resource exploitation determine the energy production costs
(prices) and hence the ultimate resource extraction quantities.
For Al, large amounts of unconventional oil and natural gas
availability were assumed. Cumulative (1990 to 2100)
extraction of oil ranges between 15 and 30 ZJ in the Al
scenarios (A1B marker, 17 ZJ); for gas the range is between 23

future success rates of hydrocarbon exploration, technology
development for either non-conventional fossil resources or
non-fossil alternatives, or future energy prices. Therefore, these
uncertainties are explored by adopting different scenario
assumptions that range from low to (very) high resource
availability (see Table 4-4), consistent with the interpretation of
the various scenario storylines presented in Section 4.3. This
scenario approach is especially important given that
hydrocarbon occurrences are the largest storage of carbon,
IPCC WGI SAR (Watson et al., 1996) estimates the size of the
total carbon “pool” in the form of hydrocarbon occurrences to
be up to 25,000 GtC. How much of this eventually could
become atmospheric emissions is at present unknown, and
depends on the future evolution of technology, prices, and
other incentives for future hydrocarbon use and their

"The conventional oil industry is relatively mature and the
question is at what point in the 21% century will the current
reserves start to run out. However, unconventional resources
are also available — shale oil, bitumen, and heavy oil. These are
starting to be exploited and they will extend current
conventional oil reserves. The gas industry is less mature and
much more remains to be discovered, particularly in areas that
do not currently have the infrastructure to utilize gas and
consequently exploration has been unattractive. Additionally,
large amounts of unconventional gas have been identified,
some of which are already in commercial production (e.g., in
the US). Also, huge quantities of natural gas are believed to
exist as methane hydrates on the ocean floor (see Chapter 3)
and it is possible that technology to exploit these will be
developed at some stage, For uranium and thorium, the
amount of exploration to date has been very limited, and hence
the possibilities of discovering new deposits are enormous. It
is likely that even a major expansion of the nuclear industry
will not be limited by the amount of available uranium or
thorium. With coal, the question is not one of discovery but
one of economics, accessibility, and environmental
acceptability.

in the A2 marker scenario totals 16 ZJ, or 2.7 times currently
identified, recoverable oil reserves (6 ZJ or 143.3 billion tons; BP,
1999). Thus, the A2 scenario also assumes that in future it will be
possible to continue the historical trend in which large quantities of
(undiscovered or presently uneconomic) oil resources are transferred
into recoverable reserves. Some analysts consider such a future trend
as definitely optimistic (see the literature review in Chapter 3).

"The coal-intensive scenario group AIC is restricted mainly to
conventional oif and gas, which results in the lowest
cumulative oil and gas use (15 to 19 ZJ) of all scenarios; it is
even slightly lower than in the B2 scenario, which has much
lower energy demand. As such, the scenario illustrates the
long-term GHG emission implications of quickly “running out
of conventional oil and gas” combined with rapid technological
progress in developing coal resources and clean coal winning
and conversion technologies. As a result, cumulative coal use is
very high — between 48 and 62 ZJ (median, 60 ZJ) between
1990 and 2100.

"Conversely, oil and gas resources are assumed to be plentiful in
the world of scenario group AlG because of the assumed
development of economic extraction methods for
unconventional oil and gas, including methane clathrates.
Cumulative oil and gas extraction amounts to 76 to 88 ZJ,
about twice as high as in the ALC scenario group. Mainly this
reflects current perceptions that radical technological change
needs to occur to translate a more significant portion of the
resource base of unconventional oil and gas into potentially
recoverable reserves, a development evidently also cross-
checked by possible developments in non-fossil alternatives.

reflected in the cumulative fossil fuel resource use,
characterized by an increasing reliance on coal resources (see
Figures 4-8 to 4-10). The cumulative oil use varies by a factor
of two across the A2-family, between 11 and 24 ZJ (median, 18
ZS, A2 marker, 17 ZJ). Cumulative gas use ranges between 20
and ZJ 36 (median, 23 ZJ, A2 marker, 25 ZJ). The higher end
of the range of gas resource use occurs in the A2G-IMAGE
scenarios, which explored the scenario sensitivity to assuming
that a significant fraction of methane hydrate occurrences
become technically and economically recoverable in an A2
world. Given the regional orientation of the A2 scenario
storyline and the resultant quest for energy independence, the
possibility of tapping even currently “exotic” fossil resources
certainly merits such a scenario sensitivity analysis. The
opposite end of the resource availability spectrum is explored
in the MiniCAM scenarios of the A2 scenario family. First,
methane clathrates are assumed not to become available. As a
result, the call on resources focuses on coal (A2-MiniCAM) or,
in a scenario sensitivity analysis, more on unconventional oil
and gas (A2-Al-MiniCAM). The range of reliance on coal
resources is thus an inverse image of the range of oil and gas
resource availability, Cumulative coal extraction varies
between 22 and 53 ZJ (median, 35 ZJ; A2 marker, 47 ZJ)
across the scenarios of the A2 scenario family. This picture
mainly represents what used to be termed “conventional
wisdom” in much of the scenario literature (including the
previous 1892 scenario series). Importantly, while the
probabilities of alternative developments of fossil and non-
fossil resource availability cannot be assessed at present, the

tesource availability does not extend much beyond current
conventional and unconventional reserves. Through gradual
improvements in technology, a larger share of unconventional

to become available at improved costs over the 215‘ century.
The availability of oil and gas, in particular, is limited

relatively limited energy options in general and extends also to
non-fossil energy options.

characterizes the B2 scenario storyline. One group of scenarios
(including the B2 marker) assumed a gradual expansion in the

whereas another group of scenarios adopted more conservative

"Chapter 3 highlights the importance of technological change in
long-run productivity growth, but also for the historical
transformations of energy end-use and supply systems. The
importance of technological change in explaining wide-ranging
outcomes in future emissions has been highlighted by Alcamo
et al., (1995) and Griibler and Nakicenovié (1996), among
others. The latter reference also provides a critical assessment
of the previous [S92 scenario series and its comparison to the
literature, Prominent scenario studies of possible technological
change in future energy systems in the absence of climate
policies include Ausubel et al. (1988), Edmonds et al. (1994,
1996a), TASA-WEC (1995), and Nakiéenovié et al. (1998).
Future technology characteristics must therefore be treated as
dynamic, with future improvement rates subject to considerable
uncertainty. This is reflected in the SRES scenarios that adopt a
wide range of improvement rates for energy extraction,
conversion, and end-use technologies (Table 4-11). The actual
representation of technological change in the six SRES models
ranges from exogenously prescribed availability, through cost
and performance profiles (which in some cases also include
consumer or end-use costs for technology use), to stylized
representation of learning processes.*! Yet, as summarized in
Chapter 3, model representations of technological change are
poorly developed, although evolving rapidly.

"Assumptions on the fossil fuel resource-base used in the BL
marker scenario quantification are based on the estimates of
ultimately recoverable conventiona{ and unconventional fossil

of resource exploitation is assumed to rise with progressive
resource depletion, but this is counteracted by learning curve
effects in the marker scenario quantification provided by the
IMAGE model. Regional estimates of the exploitation costs of
conventional and unconventional resources of Rogner (1997)
were used to construct long-term supply cost curves as of 1971,
These values, rather than absolute upper bounds on resource
base availability, define future resource availability in the
JMAGE model. The supposed availability of huge non-
conventional occurrences of oil and natural gas, with a
geographic distribution markedly different from the distribution
of conventional oil and gas, has significant implications for fuel

well-developed biomass farm plantations and harvest technologies, and biomass utilization technologies, such as biomass power

technology improvements (learning by doing and learning by using). High levels in the use of other renewable energy are

"The high-growth coal-intensive scenario group ALC assumes
relatively large cost improvements in new and clean coal
technologies, such as coal high-temperature fuel cells, IGCC
power plants, and coal liquefaction. More modest assumptions
are made for all the other technologies, except for nuclear
technologies in AIC-MESSAGE, as this requires zero-carbon
options to ease resource and environmental constraints. The
relative costs between coal and oil- or gas-related technologies
also shift in A1C-AIM. Progress in renewables is also assumed
to be substantial. For instance, solar photovoltaic costs would
decline to USCents3/kWh (A1C-AIM).

"The A2 scenario family includes slow improvements in the
energy supply efficiency and a relatively slow convergence of
end-use energy efficiency in the industrial, commercial,
residential, and transportation sectors between regions. A
combination of slow technological progress, more fimited
environmental concerns, and low land availability because of
high population growth means that the energy needs of the A2
world are satisfied primarily by fossil (mostly coal) and nuclear
energy. However, in some cases regional energy shortages
force investments into renewable alternatives, such as solar and
biomass. For instance, intermittent renewable electricity
supply options, such as solar and wind, are assumed to decline
in costs to about USCents4/kWh and (because of storage
requirements) to about twice that value when these intermittent
sources are used for medium load applications (50% of
electricity supply).

"Consistent with the general environmentally conscious and
resource-conservation thrust of the Bl scenario storyline,
technological change is largely directed at improving
conversion efficiency rather than costs for fossil technologies.
Within the SRES Terms of Reference, no additional climate
initiatives are assumed that could bar the application of certain
technologies or yield forced diffusion of others. The thermal
efficiency of centrally generated electricity is assumed to rise
to 45% (conventional coal) or to 65% (gas combined cycles) by
2100, while specific investment costs decline slightly from
1990 levels. It is assumed that subsidies on coal for electricity
generation are removed entirely. A specific feature of the
IMAGE model used to generate the B! marker scenario is that
it treats non-fossil electricity generation technologies as highly
generic; for instance, it does not distinguish between nuclear,
solar, or wind-power generation technologies. The specific
investment costs of generation options for non-fossil electricity
and of the production and conversion of commercial biofuels
are assumed to fall by 5~10% for every doubling of cumulated

"In the dynamic technology scenario group AIT, technological
change, driven by market mechanisms and policies to promote
innovation, favors non-fossil technologies and synfuels,
especially hydrogen from non-fossil sources. Liquid fuels from
coal, unconventional oil and gas sources, and renewables
become available at less than US$30 per barrel, with costs that
fall further, by about 1% per year, through exploitation of
learning-curve effects (AIT-MESSAGE). A1T-MARIA also
projects declining costs for biofuels, from about US$30 to
US$20, after the 2020 period (and in comparison to the Al-
MARIA scenario biofuels substitute coal-derived synfuels).
Non-fossil electricity (e¢.g., photovoltaics) begin massive
market penetration at costs of about USCents1 to 3 per kWh
(AIT-MARIA, AIT-MESSAGE, AIT-AIM), and could
continue to improve further (perhaps as low as
USCents0.1/kWh in AlT-MESSAGE) as a result of learning-
curve effects. An important difference between the marker
scenario A1B and the AIT group is that in AIT additional end-
use efficiency improvements are assumed to take place with the
diffusion of new end-use devices for decentralized production
of electricity (fuel cells, microturbines). As a result, final

"As a consequence of the “multi-model approach” used in
SRES, detailed improvement assumptions and scenario
implementations for individual technologies vary greatly from

characteristics were used as guiding principles and many
scenarios share similar assumptions on improvement potentials
for different technologies. Detailed quantitative comparisons
are difficult because of different time profiles of technology
improvements assumed in the different models, different
representations of regional technology, and the modeling of the
international diffusion of technology. For instance, many
models assume aggregate regional rates of technological
change (e.g., MARIA, MiniCAM, ASF), whereas others

"production. Cost decreases down to USCents2.5/kWh are
anticipated once non-fossil options penetrate on a large scale.
The costs of gaseous biofuels in the major producing regions
(Latin America, Africa, NIS) are assumed to be in the order of
US$3 to 5 per GJ from 2020 to 2030 onward. Liquid biofuels
are produced in small amounts in almost all regions at costs in
the order of US$3 to 6 per GJ. In all regions a gradual transition
occurs from fossil fuels to non-fossil options in electric-power
generation, because of rising fuel prices and declining specific
investment costs for fossil alternatives. Learning rates were
assumed, conservatively, to yield 2 to 6% cost reductions for
every doubling of cumulative production. The shift would start
in resource-poor industrialized regions such as Japan and
Western Europe, but is somewhat tempered by rising
conversion efficiencies of fossil-fueled power plants. One of
the factors that constrains the use of natural gas in the scenario
is the assumption that only a limited part of the transport
market is open to competition from non-liquid fuels (between
50% around 2050 to 80% around 2100). Also, the market share
of coal in industry is fixed exogenously at 10 to 15% in some
regions, to reflect the decreasing environmental and social
attractiveness of the more “dirty” coal.

"It is difficult to quantify the influence of varying technology-
specific scenario assumptions on scenario outcomes, because
in most model simulations the technology assumptions were
varied in conjunction with other salient scenario
characteristics, such as economic growth and resource
availability (e.g. in the MiniCAM simulations). Therefore, the
impact of alternative assumptions with respect to technological
change can be best quantified within a particular scenario
family and with “fully harmonized” scenario quantifications
(i.e. with comparable energy demand), as discussed for the Al
scenario groups above. In some scenarios within other scenario
families, technology-specific sensitivity analyses were
performed, such as in the B2C-MARIA scenario variant of the
B2-MARIA quantification. The main differences between the
two scenarios are the respective costs of coal and nuclear
power. In B2C-MARIA, the price of coal was assumed to be
US$1.4/GJ, while that in B2-MARIA is US$1.8/GJ. In
contrast, the capital costs of nuclear power stations are
US$1400/kW in B2-MARIA, while those in B2C-MARIA are
assumed to remain at US$1800/kW. Thus, even comparatively
small variations in relative technology characteristics such as
costs and efficiencies can lead to wide differences in scenario
outcomes. As discussed in Chapter 5, for instance, changing
the relative economics between coal and nuclear in the two
MARIA scenarios results in a difference of more than 200 GtC
cumulative emissions*? over the 21% century
"	Text
"The approach that underlies the B2 scenario storyline translates
into important future improvements of technologies, albeit at
more conservative rates than in scenarios Al or B1, but with
higher rates than in scenario A2. Compared to Al and B1, cost
improvements are more modest, because of the regionally
fragmented technology policies assumed to characterize a B2
world, Hence, technology-spillover effects and benefits from
shared development expenditures are more limited in the
scenario. The high emphasis of environmental protection at the
local and regional levels is reflected in faster development and
diffusion of energy technologies with lower emissions,
including advanced coal technologies, nuclear, and renewables.
For instance, solar and wind electricity-generating costs are
assumed to decline to USCents3/k Wh, that is, a similar level as
assumed for the long-term costs of advanced, clean coal
technologies (such as IGCCs). As conventional oil supplies
dwindle, initially high-cost synfuels from coal and also
biofuels are introduced as substitutes. With increasing
production volume, costs are assumed to decline from initial
levels of some US$7/GJ to US$2.6/GJ. Conventional coal
technologies undergo the lowest aggregate rates of
improvement in the scenario and are also subject to increasing
controls of social and environmental externalities (mining
safety, particulates, and sulfur emissions). Increasingly,
therefore, only advanced coal technologies are deployed.
Nonetheless, extraction and conversion costs increase,
especially in regions with a large share of deep-mined coal and
in high population density agglomerations. In regions with
abundant surface minable coal reserves (e.g., North America
and Australia), coal extraction costs remain relatively low.

"Technological change in energy supply and end-use technologies has historically been a main driver of structural changes in
energy systems, efficiency improvements, and improved environmental compatibility. Yet, despite its crucial role, the
mechanisms that underlie technological innovation and diffusion of new technologies remain poorly understood, so modeling
technological change as an endogenous process to the economy and society is still in its infancy. Historically, the track record
of technology forecasts has at best been mixed, with a number of notable failures particularly in the energy sector. In the 1960s,
for instance, R&D in the US attempted to develop nuclear-propelled aircraft, and nuclear electricity was anticipated to become
“too cheap to meter.” Conversely, the dynamic technological changes in microprocessors, information technologies, and
aeroderivative turbines (and their combination with the steam cycle in the form of combined cycle gas turbines) were largely
underestimated. This is similar to the pessimistic market outlook for gasoline-powered cars at the end of the 19"" and start of the
20"" centuries.

"First, technologies not yet demonstrated to function on a prototype scale were excluded. Therefore, for instance, nuclear fusion
is excluded from the technology portfolio of all SRES scenarios calculated with the MESSAGE model. However, production of
hydrogen- or biomass-based synfuels (e.g. ethanol) or advanced nuclear and solar electricity generation technologies are
included, as they have demonstrated their physical feasibility at least on a laboratory or prototype scale, or in some specific niche
markets (even if they are uneconomic at currently prevailing energy prices). Second, the range of technology-specific
assumptions is empirically derived. Statistical distributions of technology characteristics based on a large technology inventory
(consisting of 1600 technologies) and developed at TASA (Messner and Strubegger, 1991; Strubegger and Reitgruber, 1995)
were used. Means, maxima, and minima from these distributions (e.g. of estimated future technology costs) guided which
particular values to adopt across scenarios on the basis of the scenario taxonomy suggested by the scenario storylines (ranging
from conservative to optimistic).

"Simplifying the complex dynamic patterns of technological change across the scenario groups, one conclusion is that perhaps
the single most important dichotomy of energy technologies of relevance for future GHG emissions is between advancements
in “clean coal” and other fossil (e.g. methane hydrate) technologies (delivering electricity, gas, or synliquids) and those of
decentralized hydrogen-powered fuel cells, combined with nuclear and renewable energy (for hydrogen production). The first,
GHG-intensive technology cluster largely follows traditional centralized technological configurations of the energy sector. The
latter represents both radical organizational and technological changes. The revolutionary change may well be less the
hydrogen-powered fuel cell car itself, but rather that it could generate electricity when parked, dispensing entirely the need for
centralized power plants and utilities.

"In particular, the B2- MESSAGE scenario adopted technology characteristics of the equally conservative HASA—WEC Scenario
B (Nakicenovic et al., 1998), which was based on the Strubegger and Reitgruber (1995) analysis, complemented by a review
of some 100 energy experts assembled by WEC. Table 4-13d indicates how technology costs in the other MESSAGE scenarios
differ from those of the B2 scenario. (The prevalence of negative values in Table 4-13d indicates that most scenarios are more
optimistic concerning cost improvements of future technology than the MESSAGE B2 scenario.) Finally, Table 4-13e indicates
the difference in market deployment (diffusion) of the other MESSAGE SRES scenarios compared to that of the B2 scenario.
Positive values indicate higher market deployment, and negative ones show lower diffusion. However, differences across
scenarios in terms of technology diffusion are not governed by technology costs alone. Other technology characteristics (such
as efficiency and infrastructure availability) and market (demand) growth are also important in determining market deployment
rates and diffusion potentials of energy technologies.

these energy forms is accounted for at the level of secondary
energy, that is, the first usable energy form or “currency”

energy equivalence of electricity generated from solar photo-
voltaics or nuclear power plants is set equal to their respective
gross electricity output, not to the heat equivalent of radiation
energy from fissile reaction, the solar radiance that falls onto a
photo-voltaic panel and is converted into electricity with
efficiencies that range from 10% to 15%, or the heat that would
have to be generated by burning fossil fuels to produce the
same amount of electricity as generated in a photo-voltaic cell
or a nuclear reactor (as used in the so-called “substitution”
accounting method). This common*? SRES accounting
convention must be borne in mind when comparing the
primary energy-use figures of this report with those of other
studies, which invariably use different accounting methods
depending on the organization that produces the scenario. An
illustration of the sensitivity of different accounting methods
on estimates of primary energy use in long-term energy
scenarios is given in Naki¢enovié et al. (1998). (See also the

based on index numbers rather than absolute figures to account

"Figure 4-11 illustrates both the historical change of world
primary energy structure over time and future changes as given
in the SRES scenarios. Each corner of the triangle corresponds
to a hypothetical situation in which all primary energy is
supplied by a single source — oil and gas at the top, coal at the
left, and non-fossil sources, renewables (including wood), and
nuclear at the right. The historical change reflects major
technology shifts from the traditional use of renewable energy
flows to the coal and steam age of the 19"" century, and
subsequently to the dominance of oil and internal combustion
engines in the 20"" century. In around 1850 (lower right of
Figure 4-11), only about 20% of world primary energy was
provided by coal; the other 80% was provided by traditional
renewable energies (biomass, hydropower, and animal energy).
With the rise of industrialization, coal substituted for
traditional renewable energy forms, and by 1910 (lower left of
Figure 4-11) around three-quarters of world primary energy
use relied on coal. The second major transition was the
replacement of coal by oil and later by gas. By the early 1970s
(see 1970 point labeled on Figure 4-11), 56% of global primary
energy use was based on oil and gas. From the early 1970s to
1990, the global primary energy structure has changed little,
although efforts to substitute for oil imports have led to an
increase in the absolute amount of coal used and to the
introduction of non-fossil alternatives in the OECD countries
(e.g., nuclear energy in France). Rapid growths in energy
demand and coal use, particularly in Asia, have outweighed
structural changes in the OECD countries.

A2-IMAGE, are close to that of the marker scenario. As in the
A2 marker, and with the exception of A2-IMAGE, coal
becomes a major fuel by 2100 (45 to 50% of primary energy)
in all the scenarios, followed by renewables (19 to 31%) and
natural gas (9 to 18%). A higher share of renewables (biomass
plus other) and a lower share of nuclear is the major difference
between the scenarios (e.g., A2-MESSAGE shows the lowest
nuclear share in primary energy of 7% in 2100). The A2G-
IMAGE scenario has a quite different energy supply structure
in which natural gas is the most important source, followed by
renewables and coal, as it was designed to explore the
implications of larger gas availability in an A2 world. Table 4-

"a current 3% (excluding traditional non-commercial biomass
use) to some 66% by 2100. Given the assumption of rapid
technology progress, the costs of modern renewable energy
technologies (solar, wind, commercial biomass, etc.) decline
significantly in the long-term (see Section 4.4.7). Such low
costs could make solar energy the largest primary energy
source by 2100. Commercial, “high-tech” biomass also
increases substantially, and contributes 18% of primary energy
supply by 2100 globally. In the meantime, the shares of coal
and oil decrease from 25% and 36% in 1990 to 12% and 15%,
respectively, by 2050, and decline thereafter either because of
depletion of conventional oil resources or because of fast
market penetration of post-fossil technologies (in the case of
coal). Gas increases its market share initially (from 20% in
1990 to 33% by 2050) and declines thereafter, but still
maintains an important market share (24%) by the end of the
21* century. Nuclear is mainly a transient “backstop”
technology — its share increases from 2% in 1990 to some 10%
by 2050, and declines to 4% by 2100 because its economics
increasingly fall behind those of new renewables. Overall,
consistent with the high-income characteristics of the Al
scenario family, the share of traditional, non-commercial
biomass use declines. By 2100 its use has virtually
disappeared.
"	Text
"Major global trends in the A2 (ASF) marker scenario include
an increase in the coal share (from 29% in 1990, through 30%
by 2050, to 53% in 2100) and a reduction in the share of
conventional oil (from 43% in 1990 to 23% by 2050, from
where it declines asymptotically toward zero at the end of the
21* century). The progressive depletion of oil resources in the
scenario reflects the prevailing view as to the finiteness of
conventional oil resources,>* a picture also confirmed by other
quantifications of the storyline (see discussion below).
Nonetheless, the decline in oil market share should not be
interpreted as a physical “running out,” but rather as a gradual
replacement process via price competition with synfuels and
other alternatives as oil prices rise, along with the need to
access ever more remote and expensive petroleum deposits.
Once oil becomes increasingly expensive (starting from 2030)
a substantial proportion of coal is converted into synthetic
liquid fuels. Nuclear and renewable energy sources gradually
increase in importance from 1990 to 2100, while the share of
natural gas remains almost constant. Substantial changes in the
primary energy mix also occur at the regional level. Coal shifts
from a currently dominant primary energy source only in ASIA
and becomes the most important fuel in all the SRES regions,
Natural gas remains the second or the third major fuel. Nuclear
energy becomes important in OECD90 and ASIA regions, and
biomass and other renewables in the ALM region.

"Embedded in the overall storyline of the Al scenario family are.
the possible widely ranging technological bifurcations, cach of
which spans a “corridor” of the future evolution of primary
energy shares (see Figure 4-11). The ALC scenario group spans
a range of structural change in future energy supply between
the extremes of the A2 marker scenario and of the previous
coal-intensive IS92 scenarios (IS92a,b,e,f), Conversely, the
AIT scenario group spans a range of structural change in
future energy systems delineated by the A1B and B1 marker
scenarios, respectively. In all of these the global energy system
completes a structural shift initiated with the onset of the
Industrial Revolution. This could draw to a close more than
100 years from now, around 2100, with an energy system that
predominantly relies on non-fossil energy sources, but
evidently with a radically different technology portfolio of
“high-tech” non-fossil energy compared to the “low-tech” non-
fossil energy of 1800. The second major difference is that even
with somewhat similar primary energy structures, absolute
levels of demand would have increased by a factor 200 — 2000
EJ by 2100 in the AIT scenario, compared to a mere 10 EJ in
1800. Compared to all other scenarios, the A1G scenario group
represents a distinct cluster in which the current dominance of
oil and gas is perpetuated throughout much of the 21* century.
This scenario cluster is somewhat difficult to discern in Figure
4-11, because of the absence of structural change as a result of
which the scenario cluster in terms of primary energy shares
moves horizontally along the top part of the energy triangle.

"supply are comparatively fast because of both the dynamic
outlook on energy-efficiency improvements and structural
change and the “dematerialization” of economic activities,
characteristic of the Bl world. With lower energy demand
than in the other scenarios, technological innovation and
diffusion initially translate into slower rates of structural
change in primary energy supply (lower demand growth leads
to lower investment in capacity expansion and hence fewer
opportunities for technological learning). However, once
underway, structural change translates into radical systems
restructuring in the long term (i.e. post-2050). A persistent
long-term trend of B1 is also the continuously declining share
of coal in the global primary energy mix, caused by local and
regional environmental considerations (airborne emissions,
social and environmental impacts from large-scale mining
activities, etc.). Until 2050, the global energy system remains
fossil-fuel dominated (with an important shift away from coal
to gas use within fossil fuels). By 2020, fossils still account
for some 79% of global primary energy (23% coal, and 56%
oil and gas combined). By 2050, fossils account for 69%
(20% coal and 49% oil and gas). By 2100, however, the
transition away from fossil fuels is well underway; they only
account for some 47% of primary energy use, mostly natural
gas. The non-fossil share mirrors in its growth the declining
trajectory of fossil fuels. Generally, even this scenario of
significant structural change illustrates the long lead times
needed for an “orderly” transition away from the current
dominance of fossil fuels. Energy efficiency and
“dematerialization” of the economy are integral parts of this
transition in the B{ scenario,

"Other models have (in most instances*> with harmonized input
assumptions) examined the uncertainties associated with the
structural shift patterns described by the B1 scenario family.
Whereas long-term trends all point in similar directions,
considerable scenario variability remains, a function of
differences in energy demand, resource availability, and
technology assumptions (Table 4-16 and see Sections 4.4.6 and
4.4.7). Relatively robust patterns across all B1 scenarios
include the continued importance of oil until about 2050 (15 to
28%) and a subsequent decline thereafter. Three scenarios (B1-
ASF, BI-AIM, and B1-MESSAGE) indicate a more rapid
decline to less than 10% market share by 2100, and three
scenarios (the BI-IMAGE marker, BI-MARIA, and Bi-
MiniCAM) depict higher oil shares between 16% and 20% by
2100, largely as a function of higher oil resource availability
assumptions (see Section 4.4.6). For gas, all scenarios suggest
a relatively robust market share range of between 21% and
39% by 2050 and between 17% and 39% by 2100. Coal,
biomass, and other non-fossil sources are largely substitutes for
each other, depending on the specific cost assumptions used in
the models. Whenever nuclear, renewable, and biomass costs
are low, the share of coal declines (e.g., B1-AIM, B!-MARIA,
B1-MESSAGE) and that of other sources increases, the degree
of interfuel substitution being scenario (ie. model) specific.
Drastic shifts, however, are not anticipated before 2050. In
most scenarios (except B1-MARIA and B!-MESSAGE) coal’s
share is around 20% by 2050, and declines to below 10% by
2100 as biomass and other non-fossil sources gain respective
market shares. Their diffusion is described more conservatively
in the Bi-ASF scenario, in which coal maintains a market
share of about 22% until 2100.

"Different assumptions on these processes translate into
alternative scenarios of future land-use changes and GHG
emissions, most notably CO,, methane (CH,), and nitrous
oxide (N,O). A distinguishing characteristic of several models
(e.g., AIM, IMAGE, MARIA, and MiniCAM) used in SRES is
the explicit modeling of land-use changes from expanding
biomass uses, and hence exploration of possible land-use
conflicts between the energy and agricultural sectors. The
corresponding scenarios of land-use changes are summarized
in Table 4-17 and Figure 4-12 for the four SRES marker
scenarios and all SRES scenarios. The distinction in scenario
groups is related to the energy system and is thus not relevant
in this section.

"The main driving forces for land-use changes are related to
increasing demands for food because of a growing population
and changing diets. In addition, numerous other social,
economic, and institutional factors govern land-use changes,
such as deforestation, expansion of cropland areas, or their re-
conversion back to forest cover (see Chapter 3). Global food
production can be increased, either through intensification
(e.g., using multi-cropping, raising cropping intensity,
applying fertilizers, new seeds, improved farming technology)
or through land expansion (e.g., cultivating land, converting
forests). Especially in less developed countries, many
examples show the potentials for intensification of food
production in a more or less ecological way that may not lead
to higher GHG emissions (e.g., multi-cropping; agro-forestry).

"The B2 (MESSAGE) marker scenario first follows a trend
toward increasing shares of gas, followed by renewables, and
finally — as oil and gas start to become scarce — increasingly
returns to coal. By 2100, the B2 scenario ends up somewhere
in the middle of the triangle in Figure 4-11 (ie., it relies on a
broad, diversified mixture of different primary energy sources).
This global diversification results from heterogencous trends at
the regional level and is largely a function of the more modest
assumptions concerning technology improvements and oil and
gas resource availability (compared to other scenario families,
in particular Al and B1) that are characteristic of the B2
scenario family. By 2100, the main primary energy carriers are
biomass (23%), coal (22%), oil and gas (29%), and other
renewables and nuclear (26%). Countries with low income and
high resource availability continue to rely on fossil fuels up to
the end of the 21% century, such as China (mainly coal), Former
Soviet Union (mainly gas), and Middle East (first oil and later
gas). Regions with low resource availability, such as Africa and
South America, rely on renewables and nuclear. The decreasing
share of coal and oil in the primary energy structure of OECD
countries is substituted by the growing share of renewables,
gas, and nuclear. A major characteristic of the B2 scenario is
the increasing importance of synthetic liquid fuels in the
second half of the 21% century, because of a continuous phase
out of conventional oil in all regions.
"	Text
"Alternative B2 scenarios show a great diversity in changes in
energy systems structures compared to the B2 marker.
Common to all scenarios is their gradual transition away from
conventional oil and gas, which are assumed to be
comparatively scarce in the B2 scenario storyline. However
alternative scenarios depict very different trends for this
structural change, ranging from increased reliance on coal and
coal-derived synfuels (B2-ASF, B2High-MiniCAM) to more
biomass- and nuclear-intensive scenarios (B2-AIM, B2-
MARIA, and B2-IMAGE). Generally, this reflects the
considerable uncertainty as to direction and pace of
technological change in the technologically more fragmented
world described in the B2 scenario storyline. B2-MiniCAM
anticipates a strong reliance on oil and natural gas as
transitional fuels, with a share in primary energy of about 50%
over the next 100 years to 2100 (ie., gas shares in B2-
MiniCAM are as high as in the A1G scenario group). In turn,
B2-ASF suggests an increasing reliance on coal and coal-
derived synfuels. A third group of scenarios tends to follow
similar directions of structural change as those of the B2-
marker — a gradual introduction of post-fossil alternatives (with
different weights for nuclear and renewables as a function of
technological progress), along with gas (or in some scenarios
coal-derived synfuels) as transitional technology options.
Structural changes in energy systems of the various B2
Scenarios largely follow the main directions of the marker
scenario developed with a particular model. That is, differences

"In the AIM model, land-use changes at the beginning of the 21°

long-run land-use changes, based on an equilibrium approach
of international agricultural markets. The AIM land-use model
Is linked to the AIM energy module via biomass energy

reduce the rate of deforestation and increase the area of
managed tree-covered land in the latter half of the 21S century.
Rising food productivity also counterbalances the pressure on
cropland and pastureland in the latter half of the 21 century.
For instance, crop productivity is assumed to grow on average
by about 1.5% per year in the Al scenario family.2° However,
despite these counterbalances the demand for pastureland

1.8 GtC (1800 MtC). By 2050 this sink reduces to 0.8 GtC and
by the end of the 21* century terrestrial ecosystems become a
net source of carbon. On the other side of the natural carbon
balance is carbon sequestered by re- and afforestation. In A2-
ASF the respective (negative) carbon fluxes are estimated to
increase from 0.003 GtC in 1990, to 0.171 GtC by 2050, and
0.205 GtC by 2100.

"The ASF model used to produce the A2 marker scenario does
not generate estimates of the area covered by different
ecosystem types (e.g., forests, grasslands, etc.). However, the
ASF deforestation module estimates the area of different
tropical-forest types cleared annually for agricultural and other
purposes (Lashof and Tirpak, 1990). This information is
subsequently used to estimate GHG emissions from
deforestation. The A2-ASF scenario also includes estimates of
natural carbon sinks and additional sinks attributable to re-
forestation and afforestation activities. These estimates are
based on an extensive survey of available literature (Pepper et.
al., 1998).

"36 For comparison, the corresponding productivity growth rates in the
other scenarios range from 1% per year (B2-AIM) to 2% per year (B1-
AIM), consistent with their respective storylines. This emphasizes
productivity and efficiency (B1) and more fragmented technology and
productivity growth (B2). For A2-AIM, crop productivity growth rates
range between 1% and 1.5 % per year in the DEV and IND regions,
respectively; the difference is explained by only slowly closing
productivity gaps (approximated by GDP/capita), characteristic of this
scenario storyline. Similar differences also characterize other salient
scenario assumptions of importance to land-use changes (like biomass
yields, animal productivity, or the distribution of grain- versus range-
fed cattle). For instance, feed and protein yields from pasture land are
assumed to grow at 1.5 % per year and biomass yields at 0.5 % per
year in the Al scenario.
"	Text
"The most important indicators and assumptions made in the
IMAGE land-use model relate to agricultural yields and diets
that influence meat production, cattle population, and, in turn,
grasslands land cover. Cereal yields (to 2100) for REF, ASIA,
ALM, and the world average are assumed to increase by about
a factor of four, while cereal yields for OECD90 start from a
higher initial value and increase by only a factor of two. The
total cattle population in the IMAGE model includes dairy and
non-dairy cattle. Dairy cattle populations change as a result of
milk production per animal and the demand for milk. Non-
dairy cattle populations change as a result of meat demand,
slaughter weight, and off-take rate. The number of slaughtered
animals (beef) increases in the period 1995 to 2060, the net
result of increasing animal productivity and increasing human
consumption of meat. The total number of cattle (dairy and
beef) shows a decreasing trend beyond the year 2000, with the
near-term increase in beef cattle more than offset by a decrease
in the number of dairy cattle. The forest area reflects the result
of increasing agricultural production and increasing
productivity. The major increase in demand for food in the
initial period 1995 to 2030 is nearly compensated by increasing
productivity, with a resultant slow decline in forest area, while
beyond 2030 forest areas start expand over abandoned
agricultural land. Overall, the net balance of land-use changes
in scenario B1 between 1990 and 2100 suggests a considerable
“greening” of the planet — a net increase in forest cover by
some 1260 million ha, a decrease in cropland of 390 million
ha, and an increase of about 200 million ha devoted to biomass
production. Grasslands decline by 1540 million ha, partly
because of the afforested areas mentioned above, but also
because they are converted to other land uses. Thus, while the
B1 scenario family is characterized by “high” rates of land-use
changes, the quality of these changes (“greening”) is entirely
different compared to those of other scenario families (e.g.
A2).

"The SRES scenarios quantified emissions of CO,, CH,, N,O,

(CFCs), hydrofluorochlorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons,
perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. A detailed
discussion of the trajectories and the most relevant driving
forces is presented in Chapter 5. In all cases herein, future
emissions of these gases are affected by environmental policies
not related to climate-change concerns, as in the SRES Terms
of Reference (see Appendix I). Efforts to protect the ozone
layer will result in a significant decline in CFCs and some of
their substitutes. Urban air quality concerns will have a
significant influence on future emissions of indirect GHGs and
of sulfate aerosols. As discussed in Chapter 3, for sulfur
emissions the SRES scenarios reflect the evaluation of the IS92
scenario series (Alcamo er al., 1995), the recent sulfur scenario
literature (for a review see Griibler, 1998b), and sulfur control
policies in the OECD countries and the beginning of similar
developments in many developing countries (see Chapter 3).
Thus, a range of environmental measures is assumed in all four
SRES scenario families, although the magnitude and timing
differ as a function of the four different scenario storylines.

"Since the MESSAGE model does not include a land-use-
change module, an external scenario for land-use change
consistent with the underlying socio-economic assumptions of
the B2 scenario was adopted. This scenario was developed by
the AIM model in an iterative process between the two
respective modeling teams to ensure consistency and
harmonization in assumptions of driving-force variables (see
AIM land-use model description above). In B2, population
growth adds pressure on cropland expansion. Changing diets
(higher meat demand) with rising incomes cause an expansion
of pastureland. Land productivity increases were assumed to be
more modest (e.g. compared to the Al scenarios), consistent
with the more cautious expectations of the B2 scenario
storyline and the intermediate values adopted for productivity
increases of energy use. As a result, land-use changes are
substantial. Stabilization of population growth combined with
continued gradual increases in agricultural productivity
relieves some of the land-use-change pressure, particularly for
forests. As a result, post-2050 forest cover expands through
reforestation and afforestation activities, consistent with the
local environmental orientation of the B2 scenario storyline.
Emission patterns related to land-use change closely follow
these trends in land-cover changes. By 2100, global forest
cover in B2 shows a net increase of 230 million ha, croplands
by 330 million ha, and grasslands and biomass plantations by
300 million ha each. This “greening” of long-term land-use
patterns is at the expense of “other” land uses, and primarily
involve reclamation of degraded lands, consistent with the
emphasis on improving local and regional environmental
quality and food and energy security outlined in the B2
scenario storyline.

"Over time, the regional distribution of socio-economic activities
and emission shifts in the scenarios, albeit because of different
driving forces. These shifts range from rapid population growth
(scenario family A2) and rapid economic development and
catch-up (scenario family Al) in developing countries, to rapid
“dematerialization” of economic activities in industrial
countries (scenario family B1), Generally, scenario family B2

rates of change in the global distribution of activities and
emissions. Of all the SRES scenarios, A2-A1l-MiniCAM

SRES regions OECD90 and REF, and the developing region

1990, the base year of the SRES scenarios, driving-force
variables as well as emissions are distributed unevenly.
According to the statistics reported in Nakiéenovié er al.
(1998), DEV countries account for 76% of global population.
However, they only account for 16% to 36% of global
economic activity (considering GDP at market exchange rates
and purchasing power parities, respectively), 34% of primary
energy use, and 42% of global CO, emissions (including all
sources, from energy plus land-use changes).

"Environmental concerns in their own right are perhaps the least
important in the A2 world and they are mostly local in nature.
For instance, no environmentally related barriers to nuclear
energy development or environmental costs of fossil energy
use are assumed, However, A2 scenarios include indirect
control options for several GHGs that adversely effect local air
quality. They also require vigorous environmental controls on
pollutants that affect the availability of water, quality of soils,
and productivity of agricultural crops to ensure food security is
not jeopardized in a 15 billion person world. Hence, in terms of
a number of traditional pollutants, A2 is far from an
environmental “worst case” scenario, even if it generally has
the highest GHG emissions.
"	Text
"In this comparison, developing countries in 1990 already
accounted for 76% of world population and, because of the
inevitable demographic momentum, their share is likely to
increase further over the next few decades before alternative
demographic projections branch out into different regional
distributions. However, the basic pattern of dominance of
developing countries in global population remains unchanged
across all demographic projections. The share of developing
countries in global population ranges between 80% (Al, Bl)
and 86% (A2, B2) by 2100 for demographic projections
between 7 and 15 billion people. From the distribution of
global population, the scenarios indicate an increasing
importance of developing countries in the future, albeit at
different rates.

"The B1 scenario family assumes the most comprehensive
environmental measures (see Section 4.3). Sulfur and nitrogen
oxide emissions decline with vigorous efficiency
improvements and “dematerialization” of the economy.
Economic structural change (toward services) and cleaner
energy systems (electricity, gas, district heat) to improve urban
air quality also result in lower emissions levels compared to
other scenarios. Finally, additional “add-on” technologies,
such as flue-gas desulfurization and  de-nitrification
equipment, catalytic converters, etc., bridge the transition gap
before inherently clean energy systems (e.g. IGCC based on
coal or biomass, hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles) come
into use on a global scale. Environmental consciousness would
also lead less-developed regions to take such measures earlier
and at lower income levels than occurred in the history of
presently industrialized regions (as indeed already actually
occurs; see Chapter 5) .

(and emissions), slow recovery of economies in transition (and
thus modest growth in aggregate emission from industrial
countries), and a continuation of current trends in land-use
changes (deforestation); these only diverge in the medium- to
long-term across the SRES scenarios.
"	Text
"Yet, even with equalizing total emission levels, regional
differences in cumulative and per capita emissions remain
pronounced. Based on the estimates of cumulative CO, (all
sources) emissions since 1800 given in Griibler and
Nakicenovié (1994), developing countries reach 1990 levels of
industrial countries only between 2015 and 2030. They reach
parity (historical data from 1800 to 1990, and scenario values
from 1990 onward) at earliest by 2040 (scenario family A1),
and between 2050 (A2 and B1) and post-2100 (scenario family
B2) in the other scenarios. None of the SRES scenarios reaches
the 1990 per capita CO, emissions levels of industrial countries
in the developing countries.
"	Text
"Conversely, scenario per capita indicators converge only
slowly, sometimes well after 2100. Per capita GDP (expressed
at market exchange rates) of developing countries reaches the
1990 level of industrial countries at the earliest around 2050
(scenario family AL) and well after 2100 in scenario family A2.
None of the four marker scenarios projects a situation in which
per capita income in developing countries surpasses future
levels of per capita incomes of Annex J countries. Energy use
per capita shows a similar pattern. Only scenario family Al
depicts a development in which per capita energy use in
developing countries could approach that prevailing in
industrial countries in 1990 (by 2070) and in which it could
reach parity with industrial countries in the very long-term
(after 2100). In all other scenarios energy use per capita
remains below 1990 or future per capita energy use levels of
industrial countries. By and large, these scenario features
reflect the very large differences in present per capita levels of
economic activity and energy use, which require many
decades, even a century, to narrow. The scenarios thus portray
a feature known as “slow conditional convergence only” in the
development literature (see, e.g., Shin, 1996).

"SRES scenarios do follow the recommendation to explore
possible pathways of closing the income gap between the
industrial and now developing regions (Alcamo et al., 1995).
For reasons of plausibility and foundation in the reviewed no-
climate-policy literature, the SRES scenarios do not achieve
full income convergence in the scenario period analyzed.
However, income levels in developing countries do reach the
1990 levels of the industrial countries in the second half of the
next century in three out of four scenario families.

"Night satellite imagery from the US Air Force Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Linescan System
(OLS) offers an interesting alternative based on direct observations. Early nighttime lights data were analyzed from analog film
strips (Croft, 1978, 1979; Foster, 1983; Sullivan, 1989). Digital DMSP-OLS data have recently become available with global
coverage (Elvidge er al., 1997a, 1997b, 1999). Nocturnal lighting can be regarded as one of the defining features of concentrated
human activity, such as flaring of natural gas in oil fields (Croft, 1973), fishing fleets, or urban settlements (Tobler, 1969; Lo
and Welch, 1977; Foster, 1983; Gallo et al., 1995; Elvidge et al., 1997c). Consequently, extent and brightness of nocturnal
lighting correlate highly with indicators of city size and socio-economic activities such as GDP, and energy and electricity use
(Welch, 1980; Gallo et al.; 1995; Elvidge et al., 1997a).

"such as population, economic development, resources,
technology, land-use changes, and other factors. The scenarios
were designed in such a way as to deliberately span a wide
range, reflecting uncertainties of the future, but not cover the
very extremes from the scenario literature concerning driving
forces. A distinguishing feature of the SRES scenarios is that
various driving-force variables are not combined numerically
(or arbitrarily), but instead try to reflect current understanding
of the interrelationships between important scenario driving
forces. For instance, according to the literature review of
Chapter 3 it would be rather inconsistent to develop scenarios
of rapid technological change in a macro-economic and social
context of low labor productivity and stagnant income per
capita. Scenario storylines were the method developed within
SRES to help guide the scenario quantifications and to assure
scenario consistency in terms of the main relationships
between scenario driving forces.

"Figure 4-13 (bottom panel) shows a 1995/1996 night-luminosity map of the world developed by National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration’s National Geophysical Data Center. The map was derived from composites of cloud-free visible
band observations made by the DMSP-OLS (see Elvidge et al., 1997b; Imhoff e¢ al., 1997). The DMSP-OLS is an oscillating
scan radiometer that generates images with a swath width of 3000 km. The DMSP-OLS is unique in its capability to perform
low-light imaging of the entire earth on a nightly basis. With 14 orbits per day, the polar orbiting DMSP-OLS is able to generate
global daytime and nighttime coverage of the Earth every 24 hours. The “visible” bandpass straddles the visible and near-
infrared (VNIR) portion of the spectrum. The thermal infrared channel has a bandpass that covers 10- um of the spectrum.
Satellite altitude is stabilized using four gyroscopes (three-axis stabilization), a starmapper, Earth limb sensor, and a solar
detector. Image time series analysis is used to distinguish lights produced by cities, towns, and industrial facilities from sensor
noise and ephemeral lights that arise from fires and lightning. The time series approach is required to ensure that each land area
is covered with sufficient cloud-free observations to determine the presence or absence of VNIR emission sources.

"Spatially explicit data on socio-economic activity is sparse. The reason arises mainly in that Systems of National Accounts and
similar socio-economic statistics are available only at high levels of spatial aggregations defined by administrative boundaries
(countries, provinces, or regions). As a result, gridded emission inventories largely rely on estimations of current population
density distributions (e.g. Olivier et a/., 1996) and modeling approaches to date have also relied exclusively on rescaling future
socio-economic activities (economic output, energy use, etc.) based on current or future population density distribution patterns
(see e.g., S¢rensen and Meibom, 1998; Sgrensen et al., 1999). Population density is, however, not necessarily a good indicator
for spatial patterns of socio-economic activities (Sutton et al., 1997). At higher levels of spatial aggregation, it is estimated that
about two billion people remain outside the formal economy, most of them in rural areas of developing countries (UNDP, 1997).
At lower levels of spatial aggregations, locations such as airports, industrial zones, and commercial centers have low resident
population densities, but high levels of economic activity. Also, with increasing urbanization future population distribution will
be markedly different from present ones (HABITAT, 1996).

"Dietz et al. (2000) performed illustrative simulations of possible future light patterns. Considering the high correlation between
observed radiance-calibrated night satellite imagery data and economic activity variables like GDP, these simulations indicate
future spatial patterns of economic activity. As a basis of the simulation, Dietz et al. (2000) rescaled present night luminosity
patterns using global and regional GDP growth patterns of the preliminary A1B marker scenario reported in the SRES open-
process web site combined with a simple stochastic model of spatial evolution and interaction. An illustrative simulation for the
year 2070 is given in Figure 4-13 (top panel). The resultant changes in spatial light patterns indicate socio-economic activities
and provide useful information for infrastructure planning, such as expansion of gas and electricity networks. When combined
with topographical information, like latitude, the data can also be used as input to climate impact and vulnerability assessments
(e.g., extent of socio-economic activities that may be affected by sea-level rise).

"Table 4-20 indicates that in most cases there is an easily
discernable direct connection between main scenario
characteristics of a particular scenario family or scenario group
and the resultant outcomes in terms of cumulative emissions.
For instance, in the high GDP, high energy demand scenario
family A1, all scenarios within the two scenario groups that are
fossil fuel and technologies intensive (A1C and A1G combined
into A1FI in the SPM) result in high cumulative carbon
emissions. Conversely, cumulative emissions of the “efficiency

category, but two model quantifications indicate medium-low

"To guide readers through the different driving-force
assumptions that characterize the various scenarios, Tables 4-2
and 4-3 give an overview of the SRES scenario set. They
classify scenarios that share important input assumptions
{harmonized scenarios share global population and GDP
assumptions) from scenarios that offer alternative
quantifications. Table 4-4 summarizes the main quantitative
scenario descriptors for each of the four SRES scenario
families of the “harmonized” scenario category. Here an
attempt is made to link this information with the resultant
scenario outcomes (emissions) that are discussed in more detail
in Chapter 5.

"emissions. For the scenario family B2, outcomes in terms of
cumulative carbon emissions can also be related clearly to
scenario characteristics. One group of scenarios (which
includes the B2 marker) adopts an incrementalist perspective
of technological change (“dynamics as usual”) applied to
medium levels of population and GDP (and resultant energy
demand) and results in medium-low cumulative carbon
emissions. Another group of scenarios explored the sensitivity
of a gradual return to coal-based technologies (B2C-MARIA,
B2-ASF), in one case combined with higher energy demand
than in the other scenarios (B2High-MiniCAM); and results in
higher cumulative emissions (Medium-High category in Table
4-20).
"	Text
"In Chapter 5, an additional, complementary scenario
classification scheme to that used in this chapter is presented
and focuses on driving forces. Scenarios are classified
according to their cumulative carbon emissions (1990 to 2100,
all sources), the best single quantitative indicator available to
compare emission scenarios that portray widely different
dynamics and different combinations and magnitude of a
variety of emission categories. Four categories of cumulative
emissions, Low (<1000 GtC), Medium--Low (1100 to 1450
GtC), Medium-High (1450 to 1800 GtC), and High (>1800
GtC) are presented. Table 4-20 links the scenario overview
from Tables 4-2 and 4-3 with this information to guide readers
through the differences in scenarios.
"	Text
"considerable uncertainty and scenario variability remains. For
instance, features of technological and land-use changes can be
interpreted quite differently within the framework of different
models, even if they conform to the overall conceptual
description and “scenario logic” described in a particular
scenario family. In some instances the broad outlines of
scenario driving forces were not followed entirely in particular
scenario quantifications, but alternative —_ scenario
interpretations were submitted. These highlight important
scenario uncertainties or express scientific disagreements
within the writing team, as for future labor productivity growth
and economic “catch-up” possibilities of currently developing
countries. These alternative scenario interpretations and
different model quantifications are presented here to reflect the
SRES Terms of Reference for an open process and the use of
multiple modeling approaches, even if this necessarily
increases complexity and reduces simplicity and transparency
in discussion of a large number of scenario quantifications.
"	Text
"Equally discernable in Table 4-20 is the wide range in
cumulative carbon emissions that characterize the various
scenario groups within the Al scenario family. By design, the
different scenario groups within this family explored the
implications of different directions of technological change,
ranging from carbon-intensive developments (A1C and A1G,
combined into A1FI in the SPM) to decarbonization (AIT),
with the “balanced” technology development scenario group
taking an intermediary position. Different developments
concerning fossil or non-fossil resource and technology
availability in a less populated but affluent and thus high
energy demand world (such as A1) can lead to widely different
outcomes in terms of cumulative emissions, with a range as
wide as that spanned by all four scenario families together.
Technology can thus be as important a driving force as
population and GDP growth combined. In other words, very
different emissions outcomes are possible for future worlds
that otherwise share similar developments of main driving
forces such as population and economic growth and high rates
of technological change.
"	Text
"However, areas of overlap and uncertainties of scenario
outcomes (cumulative emissions) occur even for scenario
quantifications that share otherwise similar assumptions for the
main scenario drivers. Not surprisingly, differences in
quantifications are largest within the Al “balanced”
technological progress scenario group, which includes the AlB
marker scenario. Most model interpretations result in
cumulative carbon emissions within the Medium-High
category (1450-1800 GtC). However, there are also scenario
quantifications in which technological change tilts more in the
direction of the A1C (A1-ASF) or AIT (A1-MARIA) scenario
groups that favor fossil (coal) or post-fossil (nuclear,
renewables, and biomass) technologies, respectively. This
leads to very wide differences in cumulative emissions, from
the Medium-Low through to the High categories. A similar
range of scenario outcomes between Medium-High to High
categories also characterizes the A2 scenario family that
otherwise describes an entirely different world (high
population and comparatively low per capita income compared
to low population with high per capita income for the Al
scenario family; see Table 4-4). Departing from the main
scenario characteristics of the A2 scenario family in terms of
population and income in direction of lower values (such as in
"	Text
"References:
"	Title
"the A2-Al-MiniCAM scenario) could even yield emissions in
the Medium—Low category. Thus, the A2 scenario family also
indicates that a wide range of emissions outcomes is possible
for any given development path of main scenario driving
forces, such as population and income per capita.
"	Text
"Perhaps the most important conclusion from the SRES multi-
model, open process, and the large number of scenarios it has
generated is the recognition that there is no simple, linear
relationship between scenario driving forces and outcomes or
between emission outcomes and scenario driving forces. High
or low population scenarios need not automatically lead to high
or low emissions; similar statements also hold for economic
growth and for closing regional income gaps.

"Finally, the categorization of scenarios in terms of their
(cumulative carbon) emission outcomes illustrates that similar
emission outcomes could arise from very different
developments of main scenario drivers. For instance, High
category Cumulative emissions could arise from scenarios of
low population growth, combined with high incomes (and
energy use) and globalized technological developments that
favor accessibility and economics of fossil fuels (coal,
unconventional oil and gas; eg., AIC and AIG scenario
groups). Alternatively, similar High category cumulative
emissions could also arise from scenarios of high population
growth combined with slower per capita income growth and
more regionally oriented technology development trends
(scenario family A2). A comparison of the B1 and AIT
scenario groups (see Table 4-20) also confirms this conclusion.
Both scenarios explore pathways that reduce current income
disparities between regions. They indicate that such a tendency
does not necessarily lead to high emissions, but could be
achieved with Low to Medium—Low category cumulative
emissions (as scenario groups A1C and AIG also indicate that
High category emission pathways are possible).

scenario classification uses four intervals:

"A classification scheme is presented here to assist the reader in
understanding the links between driving forces and scenario
outputs. This scheme can also be used to help select
appropriate scenarios for further analysis (see Chapter 6).
"	Text
"Each CO, interval contains multiple scenarios and scenarios
from more than one family. Each category also includes one of
the four marker scenarios. Figure 5-1 shows how cumulative
CO, emissions from the 40 SRES scenarios fit within the
selected emission intervals.
"	Text
"3 In particular, the IPCC Working Group I (WGI) Second Assessment
Report (SAR) GWPs are calculated for constant concentrations. In
long-term scenarios, concentrations may change significantly, as do
GWP values, It is unclear how to apply GWPs to long-term scenarios
in a meaningful manner. In addition, the GWP approach is not
applicable to gases such as SO, and ozone precursors.
"	Text
"The SRES scenarios were developed as quantitative
interpretations of the four alternative storylines that represent
possible futures with different combinations of driving forces.
These broad scenario families are broken down further into
seven scenario groups,” used here to classify the input driving
forces (see also Table 4-20 in Chapter 4).
"	Text
"Table 5-2 provides an overview of this scenario classification
and links the scenario outcomes with factors that drive them,
organized by family and scenario group (see also Table 4-20).
The rows in Table 5-2 represent the emission categories, while
the columns represent the scenario families. The analysis of
Table 5-2 reveals two key results:
"	Text
"The first section in this chapter presents a “roadmap” that
serves as an orientation to the 40 SRES scenarios. The
roadmap gives a simple taxonomy that compares input
parameters, as represented by the four scenario families, and
emission outputs, as represented by the 1990 to 2100
cumulative CO, emissions. The subsequent sections discuss in
detail emissions of each gas over the next 100 years to 2100.
"	Text
"? During the approval process of the Summary for Policymakers at the
Sth Session of Working Group III (WGIID of the IPCC from 8 to 11
March 2000 in Katmandu, Nepal, it was decided to combine the AiC
and A1G groups into one “fossil intensive” group A1FI in contrast to
the non-fossil group AIT, and to select two illustrative scenarios from
these two Al groups to facilitate use by modelers and policy makers.
This leads to six scenario groups that constitute the four scenario
families, three of which are in the Al family. All scenarios are equally
sound.
"	Text
"As a result of differences in modeling and estimation
approaches, base-year (1990) emission values in SRES
scenarios developed using different models show substantial
variation. To facilitate both use of the scenarios and
comparisons across scenarios and families, base-year
emissions in all 40 SRES scenarios were standardized using
one common set of values (see Box 5-1). With a few clearly
indicated exceptions, only standardized emission values are
discussed in this chapter, A complete set of standardized
emissions, along with other quantitative scenario information,
is provided in Appendix VII.
"	Text
"In this chapter emission estimates for radiatively important
gases generated in 40 Special Report on Emission Scenarios
(SRES) scenarios are present. These gases are carbon dioxide
(CO,), methane (CH,), nitrous oxide (N,O), nitrogen oxides
(NO,), carbon monoxide (CO), non-methane volatile organic
compounds (NMVOCs), sulfur dioxide (SO,), chlorofluoro-
carbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs),!
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and
sulfur hexafluoride (SF,) (see Table 5-1). Emission estimates
presented here span the interval from 1990 to 2100 at the
global level and at the level of four SRES macro-regions
(OECD90, REF, ASIA, and ALM; see Appendix IV). In
addition, sulfur emission estimates are presented in the
regional gridded format to assist in quantifying the effects at
the local level. Links between emissions and the underlying
driving forces presented in Chapter 4 are illustrated also.
"	Text
"The scenario outputs of most interest are emissions of GHGs,
SO,, and other radiatively important gases. However, the
categorization of scenarios based on emissions of multiple
gases is quite difficult. All gases that contribute to radiative
forcing should be considered, but methods of combining gases
such as the use of global warming potentials (GWP) are
appropriate only for near-term GHG inventories.? In addition,
emission trajectories may display different dynamics, from
monotonic increases to non-linear trajectories in which a
subsequent decline from a maximum occurs. This particularly
diminishes the significance of a focus on any given year, such
as 2100. In light of these difficulties, the classification
approach presented here uses cumulative CO, emissions
between 1990 and 2100. CO, is the dominant GHG and
cumulative CO, emissions are expected to be roughly
proportional to CO, radiative forcing over the time scale
considered (Houghton et al. 1996).

"From 2000 to 2100, emissions in all the scenarios (except CO, emissions from land-use and SO, emissions) were adjusted by
applying a constant offset equal to the difference between the standardized 2000 value and the scenario-specific 2000 value.
The purpose was to smooth scenario trajectories between 2000 and 2010.
"	Text
"CO, is the largest contributor to anthropogenic radiative
forcing of the atmosphere. As described in more detail in
Chapter 3, the main sources of anthropogenic CO, emissions
are fossil fuel combustion and the net release of carbon from
changes in terrestrial ecosystems, commonly referred to as
land-use changes. To a lesser extent, CO, is emitted by
industrial activities, in particular by cement production (Table
5-3).
"	Text
"Nevertheless, differences in the base year and 2000 emissions may lead to confusion among the scenario users. Therefore, the
1990 and 2000 emission estimates were standardized in all the SRES scenarios, with emissions diverging after the year 2000.

The procedure for selecting 1990 and 2000 emission values and the subsequent adjustments to scenario emissions are described
in this box.
"	Text
"One of the primary reasons for developing emissions scenarios is to enable coordinated studies of climate change, climate
impacts, and mitigation options and strategies. With the multi-model approach used in the SRES process, 1990 and 2000
emissions do not agree in scenarios developed using different models. In addition, even with agreed reference values, it is time
consuming and often impractical to fine-tune most integrated assessment models to reproduce a particular desired result.
"	Text
"This procedure results in small distortions for those emissions that rise with time, or at least that do not ultimately decrease by
a large amount as compared to the base year. However, for emissions that fall significantly over time, such as those from
deforestation or of SO,, this procedure can cause more significant distortions and can even change the sign of the emission
estimates at later times (i.e., change positive emission estimates into negative ones and vice versa). To avoid these distortions,
for the aforementioned emissions, the year 2000 offset was reduced by 10% per decade, cumulatively, to make the offset zero
by the year 2100. This allows preservation of the shape of emission trajectories and still ensures the 2000 standardization.
"	Text
"The standardized scenarios share the same values for emissions in both 1990 and 2000. Emissions for the year 2000 are, of
course, not yet known and 1990 emissions are also uncertain. The 1990 and 2000 emission estimates for all gases, except SO,,
were set to be equal to the averages of initial values in the unadjusted four marker scenarios. This was carried out at the four-
region level, and summed to obtain the standardized global totals. The resultant estimates are within relevant uncertainty ranges
for each substance, but should not be interpreted as “endorsed” by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to
represent values for either global or regional emissions. Rather, they are the standardized base-year estimates used for the
emissions scenarios.
"	Text
"Similar cumulative CO, emissions can be attained in very
different social, economic, and technological circumstances.
High emission levels of the A2 marker scenario (A2-ASF) are
also attained in all the Al family scenarios with high fossil-fuel
use (AIC and AJG groups), for example in AlG-MiniCAM.
Medium-high emissions are attained in most of the Al group
scenarios (including the A1B marker, AlB-AIM), but also in
scenarios from the B2 scenario family with high fossil-fuel use
(e.g., B2-ASF). Medium—low emissions, which are
characteristic of the B2 family, including the B2 marker (B2-
MESSAGE), are also attained in the A2-Al-MiniCAM
scenario, which illustrates the transition between the A2 and
A\ families. Fimally, low emission levels result from almost all
the B1 family scenarios (including the B1 marker, B1-IMAGE)
as well as from scenarios that belong to the ALT high-
technology scenario group (e.g., AIT-MARIA). In Table 5-2,

affluence, technological development, environmental concerns,
and other factors. The composition of energy supply is

"SRES scenarios cover a wide range of annual emissions, and
the uncertainties in future emission levels increase with time.
Up to about the 2040s and the 2050s, emissions tend to rise in
all scenarios, albeit at different rates. Across scenarios this

"Beyond 2050, the uncertainties in energy and industrial CO,
emissions continue to increase. By 2100, the range of
emissions across the 40 SRES scenarios is between 3 and 37

an increase by a factor of six. Emissions between the 25"" and

carbon intensity declines relatively slowly until 2050 (from the
Current 21 tC per TJ of final energy to 16 tC per TJ), which

times (16 GtC) that of 1990 and fall to around 13 GtC by 2100,
which is about twice the current level (Figure 5-3a). The total,

"Rapid economic growth in the Al family scenario leads to high
energy demand and hence to a steep increase in CO, emissions
in the first decades of the 21* century. Structural changes in the
energy supply become effective only in the longer term
because of the inertia caused by long periods of capital
turnover. With respect to alternative energy supply
technologies, the AB scenario group assumes a “balanced”
approach, in which none of these technologies gain an
overwhelming advantage. This scenario group includes the
AB marker scenario developed using the AIM model (Jiang et
al., 2000), In addition to the Al scenario group, variations that
assumed fast advancements in specific energy supply sectors
were explored (renewables, ALT; oil and gas, A1G; coal, ALC)

"While still adhering to the “balanced” supply-mix assumption
(see Section 4.3.1), other scenarios within the Al balanced

on global and regional GDP growth and energy-intensity
improvements, but also from alternative interpretations of how
to translate the concept of a “balanced” pathway of

storyline) into model-specific technology assumptions.
"	Text
"The A1 fossil scenarios have essentially the same population,
GDP, and final energy demand as the AIB marker, but have a
primary energy system that relies mainly on fossil fuels. Based
on cumulative CO, emissions, scenarios from the A1 fossil
groups (A1G and A1C) fall within the high emissions category,
with AlG-MiniCAM falling roughly in the middle of the range
spanned by the six Al fossil scenarios (Table 5-2). The primary
energy system in the AIG-MiniCAM scenario emerges as a
result of rapid increases in the efficiency with which fossil
resources can be recovered, especially in the most expensive
grades of these resources; unconventional resources play an
increasingly important role toward the end of the 21% century.
"	Text
"Two alternative Al scenario groups, AIG (oil and gas) and
AIC (coal), explore high-fossil futures and one group, AIT,
explores advanced technology futures. AlG and A1C have
been combined into one fossil intensive scenario group ALFT in
the SPM (see also footnote 2). Energy-related carbon
emissions vary widely across these scenario groups in
conjunction with the scenario assumptions as to roles of
different energy sources (Figure 5-3a). The high fossil
scenarios explore worlds that consume vast amounts of coal, or
oil and gas, while with the advanced technology assumptions
the role of fossil fuel declines strongly as nuclear and/or
renewable sources are favored to supply the reduced final
energy demand.
"	Text
"The A1B-ASF and A1B-IMAGE scenarios depict futures with a
stronger reliance on fossil fuels (especially coal) than that in
A1B-AIM. In 2050 this results in higher emissions (19 to 26
GtC versus 16 GtC for the AlB-AIM; see statistical tables in
Appendix VII for more details), The emission pattern in the
A1B-MARIA scenario (Mori, 2000) is quite different. This
scenario does not reproduce an initial rapid growth in emissions,
which reach a maximum around 2050 and subsequently decline.
Instead, emissions grow more slowly and then level off. By
2050, the emissions in A1B-MARIA are well below those in
A1B-AIM (13 versus 16 GtC). Two out of three Al scenarios
developed using the MiniCAM model (A1V1-MiniCAM and
A1V2-MiniCAM) were based on somewhat different
assumptions with respect to key scenario driving forces, which
included lower energy intensity, less rapid decline in population
after 2050, and lower incomes per capita (see Chapter 4 for more
details). Emissions in these scenarios increase continuously
during the 21* century to reach about 18 MtC by 2100 (see
Statistical tables in Appendix VII for more details).

harmonized A2-MESSAGE scenario and the A2-MiniCAM
scenario have very similar global CO, emissions as compared
to the marker. Slightly higher emissions, primarily caused by
higher primary energy use, are generated in the A2-AIM
scenario. Unlike the rest of the A2 family scenarios, the A2G-
IMAGE scenario yields constant emissions after 2050. This
emission trajectory is explained by the combination of a lower
energy demand and a larger share of natural gas in the energy
supply mix (see Chapter 4 for more details). Total cumulative
carbon emissions in the A2 scenario group range between 1710
and 1860 GtC by 2100.

"Table 5-2 suggests fairly strong contrasts in the level of

category or in the upper part of the “medium-high” category.
Only the A2-A1-MiniCAM scenario falls in the “medium-low”

"Emissions in the B2 scenarios with harmonized global input
assumptions (population, GDP, final energy; B2-MESSAGE,
B2-AIM, B2-MARIA) are very close in 2100. Differences in
emissions are largest around 2050, which reflects the different
patterns of structural change in the energy systems in
anticipation of depletion of conventional oil and gas. The
emissions range for non-harmonized scenarios in the B2
scenario group is larger — between 11.2 (B2-IMAGE®) and 15.4

mix, because of high oil and gas prices. In this scenario, coal is
also widely used for synthetic liquid and gaseous fuel
production. In 2100, B2-IMAGE emissions (9 GtC) drop
below the B2 marker level, while in B2-ASF emissions

"	Text
"Generally, the SRES models use different approaches to
estimate land-use change emissions — in some cases the only
source of emissions is tropical deforestation, while in other
cases more sources and sinks (including natural) are included.”
Moreover, methodologic differences and uncertainties in
carbon content, carbon cycling, and land classification result in
seemingly inconsistent results between models that cover the
same land-use sources. These features complicate a
Straightforward comparison between land-use emissions in
scenarios generated by different SRES models.
"	Text
"Most changes in land use are induced by the demand for
cropland and grassland, which is driven by the demand for
food products, the extent of biomass energy use, and policies
and practices associated with forest management. The 1990
land-use CO, emissions remain fairly uncertain, estimated at
1.6 + 1.0 GtC (Watson et a/., 1996a); a similar level of
uncertainty is attached to current land-use emissions. This
uncertainty is reflected by the quantification of the SRES
storylines — the 1990 emission estimates from different models
range between 1.0 and 1.6 GtC, while the spread of estimates
at the four-region level is even larger. For the sake of
comparability, common, standardized (see Box 5-1 on
standardization) emissions are established at J.1 GtC in 1990
and 1.0 GtC in 2000, to reflect the net carbon flux from
contemporary changes in forest cover.
"	Text
"As suggested by Figure 5-4, no simple relation exists between
the scenario families and land-use emissions. As in the case of
energy-related emissions, the Al family scenarios cover the
widest range of emissions and trajectories. In most cases,
emissions in these scenarios decline after 2030 to zero or
negative (carbon sinks) values. However, in two scenarios
(AIB-IMAGE and A1B-MARIA), emissions increase later in
the 21% century, reflecting assumptions on additional land
pressures. As a rule, scenarios of the A2 family follow the same
convex trajectory as Al scenarios, also with two exceptions
(A2-IMAGE and A2-AIM). In accordance with the
sustainability emphasis of the B1 family storyline, scenarios
from this family have the lowest initial emissions, which by
2080 or earlier drop to zero or negative levels. The B1 family
marker scenario (B1-IMAGE) has negative land-use emissions
for most of the modeling period, a property directly related to
B1’s “environmental conservation” emphasis.
"	Text
"In general, the SRES CO, land-use emissions follow the same
pattern as found in the literature (see Chapter 3) — initially
emissions increase because of continuing deforestation in
developing regions and subsequently they decrease following a
drop in population growth and increases in agricultural
productivity. The main difference between the SRES scenarios
and the literature reviewed in Chapter 3 lies in the maximum
emission values, which are significantly lower in the SRES
scenarios. Possibly this arises because the SRES models
explicitly simulate land-use change as a function of pressure on
the land (itself a function of agricultural productivity), while in
the literature land-use CO, emission scenarios are often based
on trend extrapolation or statistical relationships (e.g. with
population growth). The rapid economic development and
technological advances assumed in the SRES storylines thus
tend to mitigate CO, emissions from deforestation, and in
some cases lead to their reversal (e.g., turning deforested lands
into carbon sinks).
"	Text
"Future trajectories of land-use CO, emissions are shown in
Figure 5-4. Emissions in the 40 SRES scenarios range widely
in the same year and change significantly over time. In
scenarios with continued deforestation, emissions rise initially,
then reach a maximum, and finally decline with depletion of
forestland that can be cleared. At the other end of the scenario
spectrum, emissions turn negative and land-use changes
become an increasing CO, sink through afforestation. By 2020,
the resultant uncertainty ranges between 0 and 3 GtC across all
40 SRES scenarios with a median of 1.1 GtC. By 2050, the
scenario range shifts to between -0.7 and 1.2 GtC (median, 0.5
GtC). By 2100 the scenario range lies between —2.8 and 2.2
GiC, with a median of 0.0 GtC. Interestingly, in specific years
(e.g., in 2050) scenarios from all four SRES families fall within
a relatively narrow emissions corridor (i.c. at least one scenario
from each of the four SRES scenario families falls within the
25"" and 75™ percentiles of the emission range). This indicates
that similar levels of carbon fluxes related to land use could
arise from widely different socio-economic driving forces,
depending on future trends in food demand and dietary
patterns, agricultural productivity growth, forest practices, etc,
"	Text
"In addition to their cumulative emissions, the scenario families
are characterized by very different emissions trajectories. The
Al fossil fuel scenarios have continuously increasing
emissions, with rapid growth before 2050 and slower growth
thereafter. The Al scenarios with the “balanced” energy mix
(e.g. the marker A1B-AIM) typically have emissions that
decline after 2050, while the A1T technology scenarios have
slower growth prior to 2050, and a steeper decline after 2050.
As for the Al fossil fuel scenarios, A2 family scenarios are
characterized by high rates of growth in emissions prior to 2050
and subsequently continued growth but at lower rates. Unlike
the rest of the A2 scenarios, the A2-Al-MiniCAM has more
rapid growth in emissions after 2050 than before 2050, because
per capita incomes in a number of developing regions do not
reach a level at which per capita energy demands rise rapidly
until the middle of the 21“ century. The B1 family is
characterized by lower growth in emissions prior to 2050,
mostly because of lower rates of growth in energy demand,
fallowed by declining emissions after 2050. Finally, the B2
family is characterized by relatively stable emissions post-2050,

"Non-CO, GHGs (CH,, N,O, and halocarbons) account for
about 40% of the total induced additional radiative forcing
compared to pre-industrial times (Houghton et al., 1996).
Whereas CO, emissions are largely attributable to two major
sources (energy and land use), other gases arise from many
different sectors and applications as shown in Table 5-3.
Consequently, their emission levels are more uncertain. Also

"Table 5-4 gives an overview of CO, emissions by sector and source category according to the IPCC reporting format given in
Watson et al. (1996b). The differences in sectoral detail across models mean a consistent comparison and sectoral CO, emission
balances are only possible within one particular modeling framework. Table 5-4 presents the scenario results as calculated with
the MESSAGE model for 1990, 2050, and 2100 and for the four scenario families and their scenario groups. Emissions related
to land-use change were derived from consistent model runs with the AIM model.
"	Text
"As in Watson et al. (1996b), emissions are presented by sector, and emission categories adopt both supply and demand
perspectives for energy-related CO, emissions. The supply side CO, balance accounts emissions at the point of energy
combustion, that is at a coal-fired power plant (electric generation) or by burning coal in industrial boilers (direct fuel use by
industry). Conversely, the demand side CO, balance accounts emissions per end-use category, irrespective of whether emissions
originate directly at the point of end-use or upstream in the energy conversion sector. For example, for residential and
commercial energy uses, CO, emissions include those from direct fuel combustion as well as those emissions that originate from
the generation of electricity consumed by the residential and commercial sectors. Finally, an emissions balance by source
category is given, in which emissions are accounted for at the level of primary energy (solids, liquids, and gases), again after
Watson et ai. (1996b). Non-energy emissions are included in a separate “others” category. Combined, these different emission
balances can serve as data input for subsequent mitigation analyses at the sectoral level or at that of the entire economy.

"Emissions of non-CO, radiatively important gases are subject
to considerable and unresolved uncertainties and are driven by
a more complex set of forces than CO, emissions. Therefore,
the types of models employed for the SRES analyses are not
expected to produce unambiguous and widely approved
estimates of emissions of these gases for a period of over a
century. Despite the limited knowledge, at some point in time
causal relationships between driving forces and non-CO,
emissions need to be crafted mto the models for the sake of
completeness, Even if new insights are generated by specialist
researchers in certain fields of environmental science, and
these become accepted as the mainstream view, their adoption
in the models is often far from straightforward, as appropriate
links to drivers may not be readily available in the underlying
structure. Limited manpower and resources imply that
priorities must be assigned when deciding on further model
development, and as a consequence the models lag behind
“common wisdom” in certain areas. Of course, this does not
necessarily limit their abilities to capture major trends at a
more aggregate level, the main purpose of these models.
"	Text
"In the IPCC WGI SAR, anthropogenic CH, emissions in the
year 1990 were estimated at 375 +75 MtCH, (Houghton er al.,
1996) and are shown in Table 5-3. These emissions arise from
a variety of activities, dominated by biogenic processes that are
often subject to considerable uncertainties (see Chapter 3).
CH, emissions across the six models used to generate the
SRES scenarios for 1990 range between 298 and 337 MtCH,.
After standardization (see Box 5-1), the base-year emissions in
the SRES scenarios were set to 310 MtCH,, within the range
mentioned above. About one-quarter of the total emissions are
related to fossil fuel extraction (CH, emissions from coal
mines, CH, venting from oil extraction), transport and
distribution (e.g., leakage from pipelines), and consumption
(incomplete combustion). The biogenic sources include
agriculture (enteric fermentation, rice paddies, and animal
waste), biomass burning, and waste management (landfills,
sewage). Based on this source list, future CH, emission
trajectories depend upon such variables as volumes of fossil
fuels used in the scenarios, regional demographic and affluence
developments, and assumptions on preferred diets and
agricultural practices.

"is between 359 and 671 MtCH,, and the range increases further
to levels between 236 and 1069 MtCH, by 2100, This wide
range in the SRES emissions reflects new information and
additional uncertainties concerning certain source categories
such as sewage systems. As for CO, emissions related to land
use (see Section 5.3.2), at least one scenario from all four
SRES scenario families falls within the 25"" and 75%
percentiles of the emission range. Thus, very different future
developments in energy and agricultural systems could lead to
similar outcomes in terms of global CH, emissions, even if the
source categories and regional patterns of these emissions are
very different. At the same time, the uncertainty range for any
given scenario family is also substantial, as indicated by the
range of 2100 emissions for the Al, A2, and BI scenario
families in Figure 5-5.
"	Text
"5). The global CH, emissions in the A2 family scenarios grow
continuously throughout the 21% century and range from 550 to
1070 MtCH, in 2100 (Figure 5-6b). The rate of growth
depends on the scenario-specific dynamics of major CH,
emission drivers. Emissions in the A2-ASF scenario, which are
close to the upper end of the range, are driven mainly by
increases in coal production, livestock population, and waste
management capacity to satisfy the needs of an expanding
population (Table 5-5). At the lower end of the emission range
are the two MiniCAM scenarios and A2-AIM. Relatively slow
emission growth in the MiniCAM scenarios is attributed
primarily to an increase in rice productivity (which offsets an
increase in the area of rice fields) and a shift in livestock
production from cattle to animal groups that have notably
lower emission factors per animal (e.g. poultry and swine), In
the A2-AIM scenario low CH, emissions are caused by
relatively low CH, emission factors for coal production and a
relatively slow increase in livestock production.
"	Text
"In the A1B_ marker scenario (A1B-AIM) emissions increase
through 2030 and subsequently decline to levels similar to
those in 1990 (Figure 5-6a). Almost all of the emissions
dynamics in A1B-AIM are explained by a rise in emissions
from landfills, sewage, and fossil fuel production. At the same
time emissions from agriculture are relatively flat because
better management of animal wastes and high productivity are
assumed to offset the effect of increased food requirements
(Table 5-5). Growing population and per capita income
combined with increased use of landfills generates increasing
emissions from landfills and sewage in developing countries
through 2030. After 2030, declining population levels, the
introduction of modern management techniques, and increased
recycling reduces waste sent to landfills and thus emissions
from these wastes. Emissions from biomass burning in A1B-
AIM are assumed to decline steadily through the adoption of
bio-recycling and other “no-waste” agricultural practices.
Similarly, CH, emissions from fossil fuel production and use
grow through 2030 and subsequently decline as fossil fuel
production falls.
"	Text
"The B1 family of scenarios covers the lower half of the full
range of CH, emissions in the SRES scenarios, with the B1-
IMAGE marker scenario positioned at the low end of this range
(Figure 5-5). Global emissions in B1-IMAGE grow through to
2030, driven primarily by increased emissions from landfills
and sewage (Figure 5-6c). This growth is partially offset by
declines in emissions from biomass burning (Table 5-5). After
2030, emissions level off and subsequently decline from 2050,
a reflection of reductions in fossil fuel production and use.
Emissions from other sources, which include enteric
fermentation and rice production, also decline, primarily from
the combination of stabilizing and declining populations with
continued improvements in slaughter weight and off-take rate.
The B1-AIM scenario lies in the middle of the range for the B1
family. CH, emissions in this scenario increase through to
2050, with most of the increase associated with landfills and
sewage systems. After 2050, emissions from landfills decline
because of a combination of factors that include recycling and
a declining population. Emissions from sewage decrease after
2050 through the decline in population. Emissions from rice
production stay relatively flat because of increases in rice
productivity. Emissions from fossil fuel production increase
through to 2030 and subsequently decline, which mirrors the
increase in production of fossil fuels through to 2030 and the
increased use of renewable energy after 2030. Unlike other B1
scenarios, both MiniCAM cases have emissions that
continuously increase (Figure 5-6c). The reason is a slow rise
in non-energy system emissions for the Bi-MiniCAM
scenario, which offsets the decrease in energy system
emissions and the nearly constant emissions in the agriculture
sector. In the BlHigh-MiniCAM scenario, the additional
energy demand designed into this scenario is met largely by an
increased use of natural gas, which thus explains the faster rise
in CH, emissions in this scenario as compared to the base B1
MiniCAM scenario.

"Uncertainties in the estimates of current N,O emissions (Table
5-3) are also reflected in base-year 1990 differences, between
4.8 and 6.9 MEN across the six models used to develop the
SRES scenarios. The range across the four markers (Table 5-3)
is not as wide, between 6.0 and 6.9 MIN, and leans more toward
the higher end of the uncertainty range reported in Houghton et
al. (1995). After standardization, 1990 N,O emissions in the
SRES scenarios were set to 6.7 MtN, well within the IPCC
WGI SAR range (Table 5-3). Even more so than for CH,, food
supply is assumed to be a key determinant of future N,O
emissions, Size, age structure, and regional spread of the global
population are likely to affect future emission trajectories,
together with diets and rates of improvement in agricultural
productivity. The representation of how these driving forces
translate into N,O emissions varies across the models because
of differences in both sectoral coverage and emission factors.
As a result, differences in emission trajectories are not only
scenario dependent, but also model dependent, which illustrates
additional uncertainties in our understanding and representation
of driving forces and their influence on N,O emissions.
"	Text
"The four SRES marker scenarios illustrate a complexity of
relative impacts of technology, GDP, and population on CH,
emissions. In 2050 and 2100 the A2 and B2 markers have very
similar per capita emissions, which indicates a certain
similarity between the cumulative impact of economic,
technological, and structural changes on emissions in both of
these scenarios (in spite of significant differences in the global
average per capita incomes). Hence, differences in the absolute
emission levels in these scenarios can be explained primarily
by differences in population trajectories, with the A2
population in 2100 being 1.5 times larger than the B2
population. At the same time, differences in the absolute
emissions between the AlB and Bl markers cannot be
explained by population size (both markers have the same
population trajectory), but instead result from the greater
emphasis on “dematerialization” and “sustainability” in the B1
storyline. The two illustrative scenarios Al1G-MiniCAM and
AILT-MESSAGE display similar patterns of methane emissions
as the A2 and Bi marker scenarios respectively and are
therefore not discussed separately here.

"N,O emission trajectories of the A2 scenario family fall into
two major groups. The first group includes the A2-AIM and

relatively low rate and do not exceed 10 MtN in 2100 (Figure
5-8b), because of a relatively slow increase in nitrogen
fertilizer input and omission of N,O sources associated with
animal wastes. N,O emissions in the second group of scenarios
(which includes the family marker A2-ASF) grow steadily
throughout the 21‘ century, driven by an increased demand for
food and associated increases in the animal waste and nitrogen
fertilizer use (Table 5-6). In 2100 the emissions from this group

is associated with the agriculture sector, primarily with animal
manure management. Emissions are driven by a rapid increase
in income that induces steep increases in meat and dairy
consumption. The AlB-AIM marker scenario has emissions
near the low end of the range. This scenario assumes that
fertilizer use in developing countries is nearly saturated and
that increased productivity comes from better management. A
portion of nitrogen from fertilizers is also assumed to be stored
indefinitely in underground water. However, the emissions

"The range of emissions across all 40 SRES scenarios increases
continuously over the 21* century (Figure 5-7). By 2100, N,O
emissions range between 5 and 20 MIN. Emission ranges also
tend to be comparable across the four scenario storylines, an
indication of the decisive impact of uncertainty in the modeling
(mentioned above). Future N,O emissions in the SRES
scenarios tend to cluster into two broad groups — those that
project relatively flat, even slightly declining, emissions and
those that indicate continuously rising trends toward high
emission levels. Some other scenarios (e.g. AIB-ASF, B1-ASF,
and B1-IMAGE) indicate the possibility of transitional
emission patterns in which N,O emissions peak around 2050
and decline thereafter, more or less in step with the population
size, As a result of differences in modeling approaches, no
individual scenario tracks the mean or median across all 40
scenarios of the SRES set.

related emissions and declines of emissions from other sectors

Emissions in the B2-ASF scenario are between the middle of
the family range and its high end. The continuous increase in
emissions in the B2-ASF scenario (which lie between the
middle and high end of the family range) occurs through
growth in nitrogen fertilizer use, in animal wastes, and in
mobile sources. It is driven by increases in population and, to
a smaller extent, by per capita increases in consumption of
meat and dairy products.
"	Text
"The spread of N,O emissions in the B1 family is quite large.
The high-end reflects the agricultural assumptions used in the
MiniCAM model, in which continued growth in meat
production is driven by increases in per capita consumption
that more than offset the reduction in population size (Figure 5-
8c). The B1-AIM scenario has emissions near the low end of
the range, because fertilizer use in developing countries is
assumed to level off and better management increases
productivity. Emissions from animal waste, mobile sources,
and other sources in B1-AIM are nearly constant. The BI-
IMAGE scenario (B1 family marker) has slowly increasing
emissions through to 2050, which predominately originate
from increases in livestock and the use of synthetic fertilizer
(Table 5-6), After 2050, these emissions decline as the
population size and associated demand for animal products
declines (Figure 5-8c). The BI-ASF scenario has an
intermediate emission trajectory with a maximum of 11.5 MitN
in 2050 and a subsequent decline to 9.3 MtN by 2100 (Figure
5-8c). The two illustrative scenarios A1G-MiniCAM and A1T-

Montreal gases will be replaced completely by HFCs.
Currently, HFC-134a is favored, and it is the only HFC with
sufficiently large sales to be included in the current production
and sales statistics (AFEAS, 1998). The global emissions of
this gas are estimated to be 0.1 kt HFC-134a in 1990 and 42.7

varies according to the aluminum production technology used.
The default emission factor from the Revised [PCC Guidelines

factor of 0.8 kgCF,/t was used for 1990 and this was assumed

agreement with the value of 0.51 kgCF,/t recommended by the
IPCC Expert Meeting on Good Practices in Inventory
Preparation for Industrial Processes and the New Gases

emissions, will come to a halt in 2050. To calculate the HFC-
23 emissions, information from Oram et al. (1998) was used
(estimated emissions of HFC-23 at 6.4 kt in 1990). By relating
this value to 178.1 kt HCFC-22 emitted in 1990 (WMO/UNEP,
1999), an emissions factor of 0.036 tons of HFC-23 per ton of
HCFC-22 was calculated and applied to estimate future
emissions. Since this estimation procedure does not take into
account any pollution control regulations (that are not driven
by climate considerations), it may result in an overestimation
of HFC-23 during the early decades of the 21° century, until
HCFC production is phased out under the Montreal Protocol.
After the phase-out of HCFC-22 consumption, some HFC-23
emissions will still occur because of the continued HCFC-22
feedstock production allowed under the Montreal Protocol.

reported in Fenhann (2000). Future production was projected
assuming the same consumption elasticity to GDP as for
aluminum (see discussion above). In 1996, about 41% of the
world magnesium was produced in the US; of this, only 16%
was processed in foundries for casting that resulted in
emissions of SF, (Victor and MacDonald, 1998). Since the
distribution of world foundry capacity appears to be roughly
similar to that of world magnesium production, Fenhann
(2000) assumes that, presently, {6% of the produced
magnesium is processed in foundries across all regions.
Relating this amount of the processed magnesium to the
aforementioned emission of 1200 tSF, per year yields an
emission factor of 21 kgSF, per ton of magnesium processed in
foundries, The demand for magnesium in automotive
applications as a strong lightweight replacement for steel is
growing quickly. Hence, it is expected that the fraction of total

are about twice as large as in 1990 (Figure 5-9), B2-ASF has a
similar trajectory, while the B2-AIM scenario has essentially
constant NO, emissions over the entire period. Emissions in
the B1 marker (B1-IMAGE) are among the lowest of all the 40
scenarios (Figure 5-9). In this scenario, emissions increase
stops around 2050 and subsequently declines toward the end of
the 21 century to 60% of the current level. Other scenarios
within the BI group coincide well with the B1 marker in 2100,

"Model differences at the regional level are even larger, which
reflects the greater uncertainty of emission inventories at this
level, particularly outside the OECD countries. To standardize
sulfur emissions, the number of SRES reporting regions was
increased to six regions, by splitting Latin America from the
ALM region and Centrally Planned Asia and China from ASIA.
Important differences in economic development status and
resource endowments lead to different patterns of sulfur
emissions across all SRES scenarios. Regional emissions were
standardized (see Box 5-1) and then aggregated to the global
level. Global standardized base-year emissions for 1990 for the
SRES scenarios are equal to 70.9 M&S, in line with the literature
range of global emission inventories given above. The regional
sulfur emission profiles were also used to generate spatially
gridded emission patterns (see Section 5.6.2 below).
"	Text
"Base-year differences in the available data sources are
especially important because regional sulfur emissions trends
have changed drastically in the past decade. Although they
decreased strongly in Europe and North America as a result of
sulfur control policies, they increased rapidly in Asia with
growing energy demand and coal use. For instance, between
1980 and 1995 sulfur emissions declined by 59% in Western
Europe and Russia (albeit for entirely different reasons —
environmental policy limiting sulfur emissions in Western
Europe versus a massive economic depression in Russia), by
37% in Eastern Europe, and by 36% in North America (ECE,
1997). Conversely, emissions in China rose rapidly, from an
estimated 6.6 MtS in 1985 to 9.1 MtS in 1994, or by 38%
(Sinton, 1996; Dadi et al., 1998). These diverging emission
trends and their rapid changes also require a continuous
updating of available gridded sulfur emission inventories (e.g.,
Dignon and Hameed, 1989; Spiro et al., 1992; Benkovitz er al.,
1996; Olivier et al., 1996) that in, some instances, still rely on
outdated 1980 emissions data.

2060 the lowest emissions are produced by the A2-Al-
MiniCAM scenario, while after 2070 the lowest emissions are
achieved in the A2-ASF scenario.

"The AIT, ALG, and AIC scenario groups assume various roles
for the development of energy resources and technologies (the
coal-intensive AlC scenario group, the oil- and gas-intensive
AIG group, and the AIT scenario group with accelerated non-
fossil technology diffusion). Consequently, they span a very
wide range of future sulfur emissions, ranging from 20 MtS by
2100 in the AIT-MESSAGE scenario to 83 MtS in the A1C-
AIM scenario.
"	Text
"As technological progress and income growth are the slowest
in A2 among all the SRES scenario families, the primary
energy mix in the A2-ASF marker by 2100 is still dominated
by fossil fuels, with about 50% of the primary energy supplied
by coal. Although measures are adopted to limit local and
regional environmental damages, sulfur-mitigation measures in
the A2 world are Jess pronounced than in the other SRES
scenarios. Therefore, global sulfur emissions in the A2 marker
are highest as compared to the other markers (Figure 5-12).
"	Text
"The relatively rapid desulfurization in the AIB-AIM marker
compared to the other SRES markers mainly results from high
capital turnover rates and, therefore, rapid diffusion of new and
clean technologies combined with high income levels in the
developing world by the middle of the 21"" century (Figure 5-
12). The structure and patterns of sulfur emissions for the two
illustrative scenarios in the two scenario groups ALFI and AIT
are similar to those of the A1B and B1 marker scenarios,
respectively, and are therefore not discussed separately here.
"	Text
"Sulfur emissions in the B1 family scenarios fall within the
lower third of the full range of emissions from the SRES
scenarios (Figure 5-12). The B1-IMAGE trajectory is generally
positioned in the middle of the B1 family range in the first
decades of the 21 century, which corresponds to a 75%
reduction of emissions in industrialized countries between
2000 and 2050. The near-term increase in emissions in B1-
IMAGE occurs predominantly in developing countries and is
associated with increases in fossil fuel use in those regions,
combined with relatively low levels of emission controls. After
"	Text
"Sulfur emission trajectories in all the A2 family scenarios,
except A2-Al-MiniCAM with its much lower energy
consumption, have the same general convex shape (Figure 5-
13b). However, the time when maximum emissions are
attained varies quite widely across the scenarios, Emissions
peak in the A2-ASF marker scenario in 2030, in A2-
MESSAGE in 2040, in A2G-IMAGE in 2050, in A2-
MiniCAM in 2060, and in A2-AIM not until 2070. These
differences are explained primarily by different assumptions
about the mechanisms of SO, reduction adopted in different
models. For example, the SO, reduction in A2-MESSAGE is
explained by fundamental structural changes in the electricity
generation technologies, while the A2-ASF scenario assumes a
rapid introduction of inexpensive end-of-the-pipe sulfur
scrubbers and shifts to low-sulfur fuel qualities.
"	Text
"Emissions in the B2 family scenarios cover close to the full
range of SO, emissions (Figure 5-12). The B2-MESSAGE
scenario yields steadily declining global emissions from 1990.
This overall trajectory includes a tripling of emissions from
non-energy sources by 2050, with subsequent stabilization and
eventual decline after that (Figure 5-13d). The increase in
emissions from non-energy sources is more than offset by very
rapid reductions in emissions from energy sources between
2015 and 2050. Developing countries have rising emissions
through to 2025, which stabilize by 2050, and decline
thereafter. This increase in emissions in developing countries is
offset by reductions in developed countries. These results are
explained largely by regional measures and technological
changes to minimize critical loads of acidic deposition (see
Box 5-4). The B2-ASF scenario projects very rapid growth in
emissions from energy use through 2025, primarily from
increases in fossil fuel use in developing countries. After 2025,
the growth in fossil fuel declines and developing countries
become wealthier and are more aggressive on SO, emission
controls, which in the ASF model are directly linked to
GDP/capita levels. Emissions from other industrial sources
increase steadily throughout the period as economic activity
increases.

"The scope of reductions from fuel switching is illustrated by the following. At present, 60% of anthropogenic SO, emissions in
developing regions are from the direct use of fossil fuels in buildings and industry (Smith et al., 2000). Reductions i in these
emissions will be realized by shifting from an energy structure that relies on the direct use of solid fuels to one that increasingly
relies on distributed energy grids (electricity, natural gas, etc.). This shift, and a resultant decrease in SO, emissions, has already
occurred in Europe and North America. Further reductions are expected in the future as more efficient, and inherently low
emission, fossil fuel technologies (such as IGCC) become commercialized. Explicit policies for sulfur emissions reductions,
such as the use of FGD devices, will be needed to meet emissions targets in the near term, but are likely to be less necessary in
the longer term.
"	Text
"The percentage reductions in energy-related SO, emissions in the B2 scenario are shown in Table 5-12 as a function of time for
five technologies. These percentages were obtained by re-calculating the B2-MESSAGE emissions scenario with the energy
structure and emissions coefficients held constant in time at those of 1990. In this hypothetical case, SO, emissions in 2100
would be 227 MtS. Accordingly, energy-related SO, emissions in 2100 are reduced by about 215 MtS in the B2 scenario, 68%
of which results from technological change and 32% from fuel switching. By the year 2100 the contribution to these emissions
reductions by flue-gas scrubbing (FGD) is negligible by the year 2100, because more-advanced coal technologies eliminate any
need for it. Furthermore, a shift in refining technology to lighter oil products, currently underway worldwide, contributes to a
reduction in SO, emissions, particularly in the early part of the 21* century.
"	Text
"To illustrate these trends and the resultant decrease in SO, emissions over the 21"" century, emissions in the B2-MESSAGI
scenario (Riahi and Roehrl, 2000) are analyzed. Global energy-related SO, emissions in this B2 scenario decline from 59 Mt!
in 1990 to about 12 Mts in 2100. The primary causes for this reduction are the transition to more advanced coal technologie:
and desulfurization. Consistent with the characteristics of gradual change in the B2 storyline, the aggregated emission
coefficient! for power production from coal declines from about 5.3 kgS/MWh in 1990 to 0.04 kgS/MWh in the year 2100
The latter emissions intensity is similar to that of the most advanced current technologies, for example, the Siemens IGCC9!
power plant featuring 0.032 kgS/MWh (Baumann et al., 1998). In the second half of the 21% century, desulfurization of th
energy system also takes place because of the production of methanol from coal. Sulfur removal is a process-inherent feature
Methanol is mainly used in the transport sector as a substitute for oil products that become scarce after 2050.

"As Tables 5-13a to 5-13d clearly illustrate, the distribution of
emissions over the four regions in the base year (1990) is very
uneven, For example, while in industrialized regions (OECD90
and REF) fossil and industrial CO, emissions are dominant, in
the developing regions (ASIA and ALM) the contribution of
land-use emissions (deforestation) is also very important. In
1990, developing regions produced much lower volumes of
CO, and high-GWP gases than the industrialized world, while
their relative share of N,O, CH,, and NO, emissions was much
more substantial (see Figures 5-13a to 5-13d).
"	Text
"The fossil fuel and industrial CO, emission trajectory of the
REF region is even less linear than in the OECD90 region.
Initially, emissions decline from the base year level of 1.3 GtC
to 1.1 GtC in 2020 because of economic restructuring. After
2020, emissions increase, driven by an increased energy
demand to support renewed economic growth (Figure 5-14).
However, after 2050 emissions decline again primarily through
a decrease in population and improved energy efficiency. By
2100, non-fossil fuels in REF contribute 58% of the total
primary energy use and the share of natural gas reaches almost
40%.

"All the SRES marker scenarios anticipate increasing levels of
sulfur control, with rates and timing ranging from rapid
introduction of stringent controls in B1-IMAGE to more
gradual, later, and less stringent controls in A2-ASF, To
illustrate the impacts of sulfur controls in the scenarios, an
“uncontrolled sulfur’ variant of the B2 marker scenario was
calculated at the International Association for Applied Systems
Analysis (IIASA; for details see Box 5-4). In this hypothetical
scenario, sulfur emissions amount to 182 MtS in 2050 and 227
MtS in 2100 (compared to 57 and 47 MIS, respectively, in the
B2 marker scenario). These emission levels are much higher
even than those in the A2 marker scenario (105 MtS in 2050
and 60 MtS in 2100).
"	Text
"Regional information on emissions serves at least two major
purposes — to identify the contribution of world regions! to the
global total and to track shifts in the relative weight of different
regions, This information is especially relevant for the
development of mitigation scenarios. For climate modeling, the
regional distribution of emissions for well-mixed GHGs (CO,,
CH,, N,O, and halocarbons) may not be that important.
However, short-lived gases such as SO, are radiatively
important close to the point of origin only; their local and
regional concentrations may significantly change the future
climate outlook. The same is true for the group of ozone
precursors (CO, NO,, and NMVOCSs). To be able to estimate
tropospheric ozone concentration levels, regionalized
information is indispensable.
"	Text
"In the OECD90 region, standardized fossil fuel and industrial
CO, emissions in the AIB marker scenario (AlB-AIM)
increase from 2.8 GtC in 1990 to 3.4 GtC in 2050, and
subsequently decline to 2.2 GtC in 2100 (Figure 5-14).
Compared to other scenarios, the growth in primary energy use
in this region is relatively high, spurred by rapid economic
development (see also Chapter 4). However, after 2050 the
increases in the use of primary energy are accompanied by
declining emissions through the combination of a lower use of
fossil fuels and a switch from coal to gas. The share of non-
fossil fuels in the ORCD90 region of the A1B marker scenario
also increases drastically. In 2100, the contribution of non-
fossil energy amounts to 68% of the total primary energy use
of the OECD90 countries, the largest non-fossil fuel share for
this region of all the SRES marker scenarios.

"Adding land-use CO, emissions to the energy- and industry-

distribution of emissions across regions (Figures 5-14 and 5-

the industrialized and developing regions within global CO,

"Changes in land use are influenced primarily by the demand
for cropland and grassland (to supply plant and animal food to
the world population) and by the role of biomass energy. The
uncertainty of emission estimates is reflected in the models
used to quantify the SRES scenarios — in 1990 they range
between 1.0 and 1.6 GtC and the spread at the regional level is
even larger. In all the SRES marker scenarios, most emissions
related to land use originate from the ASIA and ALM regions
(Tables S-13a~d). In the industrialized regions, the land-use
change emissions in 2100 vary from —0.40 to +0.04 GtC. In the
developing regions emissions from land-use change span a
larger range (from —0.56 to +0.35 GtC).

"In the B2 world (illustrated by the B2- MESSAGE marker), the
regions exploit comparative resource and technology
advantages to structure their energy systems, Combined
emissions in the OECD90 and REF regions remain more or less
stable, changing from 4.1 GtC in 1990 to 4.3 GtC in 2100. The
relative share of these two regions decreases from 69% in the
base year to 31% in 2100 (Figure 5-14, Tables 5-13a-d), In the
B2 marker scenario, fossil fuel and industrial CO, emissions in
the OECD90 region increase to 3.71 GtC by 2020. Thereafter,
emissions decline to 3.3 GtC in 2050 and to 3.1 GtC in 2100.
This dynamic is caused by a decline in the use of fossil fuels
and by the replacement of oil with natural gas, as pressure on
the oil resource base increases considerably after 2050. In the
REF region, standardized fossil CO, emissions decline to 0.8
GtC in 2020, after which they return to the 1990 level by 2100
(1.2 GtC). Toward the end of the 21° century, primary energy
usc in this region decreases while emissions increase because of
a switch to coal (mainly to produce liquid substitutes for oil). In
ASIA, both primary energy use and carbon emissions increase
during the 21% century. Although the use of non-fossil fuels
becomes more important, the contribution of fossil fuels to
emissions remains high. The use of coal, oil, and gas increases
until 2050, after which the use of oil and gas decreases, while
the use of coal grows rapidly. Population, energy use, and
emissions in the ALM region constantly increase during the 21%
century. Again, the fossil fuels retain a dominant role and
supply 47% of the energy requirements in 2100. Gas use
increases until 2100, while the use of coal is rather stable until
2050 and shows a rapid increase afterward. Oil use drops
sharply after 2050 as resources become depleted.

highest methane emissions are attained in the B2 marker,

"in the industrialized regions. It also illustrates that the global
pattern ts strongly influenced by the developing region
trajectories. Furthermore, reflecting different development
perspectives in the four SRES families, CO, emissions grow
differently in ASIA and ALM. In the A1B marker, emission
trajectories in ALM and ASIA are roughly parallel over the
entire time horizon, In the B! marker, this is only true in the
earlier years. As the emission of ALM peaks and then declines
later than that of ASIA, emission trajectories diverge strongly
in the second half of the 21% century. In the A2 marker,
emissions in ALM start to grow at a lower rate than in ASTA,
but subsequently catch up and later the two are again fairly
close. Finally, in the B2 marker, ALM emissions initially grow
at a modest rate, close to those for the OECD90 region and the
world average. In later years, the growth in ALM exceeds the
global rate, but total carbon emissions remain far below those
in the ASIA region (Figures 5-15, 5-16).

"Emissions of other short-lived gases (CO, NO,, NMVOCs, and CH,) also needed to be mapped to a global grid for use in

specific adjustments were made for international shipping.
"	Text
"These emissions were mapped to a global 1° x 1° emissions grid. For each region, the pattern of total SO, emissions from the
EDGAR database (Olivier er al., 1996) was scaled by the total emissions for that region and a time period. Emissions for
OECD90 countries were first scaled individually to their country-specific values. The value of 3 MtS was added to reflect
international shipping, with the pattern and magnitude of these emissions held constant.

"The climate effects of SO, are intrinsically regional and emissions on a latitude-longitude grid are required as input to climate
models. Emissions of SO, were first standardized for four world regions as described above. Then, emissions from the marker
scenarios for six regions (OECD90, REF, Centrally Planned Asia, Rest of Asia, Latin Ametica, and Africa/Middle East, scaled
to match the standardized emissions) were used for gridding purposes. For the Annex IT countries, a value of 23 MtS was taken
for 1990 emissions, a figure derived from a compilation of country-level emissions inventories (Smith et al., 2000).

"In “high income regions” (OECD90, REF) sulfur emissions
have already passed their peaks and are actually declining at
present. This trend is expected to continue in all the markers,
except A2 in which an increased use of coal “counters” a
decline in specific emissions in OECD90 (Figure 5-20).
Emissions in ASIA grow in all the markers by 2020, and then
decline by 2050, and further decline by 2100. The most
dramatic decline is registered in the A1B marker; this is related
to its aggressive assumptions on the introduction of low-sulfur
technologies and fuel switching in the ASIA region (see Box 5-
3 for more details), Unlike ASIA, the ALM region sees
increases in emissions in all four markers from 2020 to 2050,
because of the somewhat “mixed” nature of this region, which
combines countries with substantially different affluence levels
and development trends. However, by 2100, when low-sulfur
technology becomes widely available everywhere, emissions in
the ALM decline in all markers (Figure 5-20).
"	Text
"As discussed above, global sulfur emissions eventually decline
in all SRES scenario families and associated groups. In
addition, the regional distribution of emissions changes
drastically over time. While in previous decades major sulfur
emitters were located primarily in industrialized regions of the
world, presently emissions for these sources are declining
because of the introduction of cleaner fuels and the conversion
to low-sulfur technologies to comply with environmental
regulations. In the majority of SRES scenarios, this trend is
expected to continue. Meanwhile, less-developed regions are
anticipated to experience strong economic growth associated
with an increased demand for energy. Especially in the short
term, fossil fuels are likely to satisfy the major share of this
new demand, which may lead to a steep initial growth in sulfur
emissions. As mentioned earlier (see Section 5.5.2), at some
point in time sulfur emissions will be controlled in all the
Scenarios and, together with shifts to essentially sulfur-free
energy resources, they will decrease in the developing regions

"The set of 40 emissions scenarios in this Special Report on

assessment of the literature, six alternative modeling
approaches, and an “open process” that solicited wide
participation and feedback from many groups and individuals.
The set of scenarios includes all relevant species of greenhouse
gases (GHGs)! This chapter provides a summary of the SRES
emissions scenarios and compares them with the previous set
of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) IS92
scenarios and the underlying literature.

"Scenarios are appropriate tools for dealing with such
uncertainty. Scenarios are images of the future, or alternative
futures. As an integration tool in the assessment of climate
change they allow a role for intuition, analysis, and synthesis;
thus we turn to scenarios in this report to take advantage of
these features to aid the assessment of future climate change,
impacts, vulnerabilities, adoption, and mitigation. Scenarios
are not predictions. A set of scenarios can assist in the
understanding of possible future developments, and hence the
development of a set of alternative scenarios (sce Chapters 1
and 4 for more detail).
"	Text
"All four storylines and scenario families describe future worlds
that are generally more affluent compared to the current
situation. They range from very rapid economic growth and
technological change to high levels of environmental
protection, from low to high global populations, and from high
to low GHG emissions. What is perhaps even more important
is that all the storylines describe dynamic changes and
transitions in generally different directions. Although they do
not include additional climate initiatives, none of them are
policy free. As time progresses, the storylines diverge from
each other in many of their characteristic features. In this way
they span the relevant range of GHG emissions and different
combinations of their main sources.
"	Text
"The SRES writing team reached a broad consensus that there
could be no “best guess” scenarios; that the future is inherently
unpredictable and that views will differ as to which storylines
could be more likely. There is no “business-as-usual” scenario.
The storylines represent the playing out of certain social,
economic, technological and environmental paradigms that will
be viewed positively by some people and negatively by others.
The writing team decided on four storylines — an even number
helps to avoid the impression that there is a “central” or “most
likely” case. The team wanted more than two storylines to help
illustrate that the future depends on many different underlying
dynamics, but no more than four, as they wanted to avoid
complicating the process with too many alternatives. The
scenarios cover a wide range, but not all possible futures, In
particular, it was decided that possible “surprises” would not be
considered and that there would be no “disaster” scenarios.
"	Text
"The SRES approach involved the development of a set of four
alternative scenario “families” that encompass the 40
scenarios. Each family of SRES scenarios includes a
descriptive part called a “storyline,” and a number of
alternative interpretations and quantifications of each storyline
developed by six different modeling approaches. All the
interpretations and quantifications of one storyline together are
called a scenario family (see Chapter 1 for terminology). Each
storyline describes a demographic, social, economic,
technological, and policy future for one of these scenario
families. Within each family different scenarios explore
variations of global and regional developments and their
implications for GHG and sulfur emissions. Each of these
scenarios is consistent with the broad framework of that
scenario family as specified by the storyline. Chapters 4 and 5
give a more detailed description of the storylines, their
quantifications, and the resultant 40 emissions scenarios.
"	Text
"The first step in the formulation of the scenarios was the review
and analysis of the published literature and the development of
the database with more than 400 emissions scenarios
(accessible on the web site, www-cger.nies.go.jp/ cger-
e/db/ipec.html). One of the recommendations of the writing
team is that IPCC or a similar international institution should
maintain such a database to ensure continuity of knowledge
and scientific progress in any future assessments of GHG
scenarios. An equivalent database to document narrative and
other qualitative scenarios would also be very useful for future
climate-change assessments. One difficulty encountered in the
analysis of the emissions scenarios is that the distinction
between climate policy scenarios, non-climate policy
scenarios, and other scenarios appeared to be to a degree
arbitrary and was often impossible to make. Therefore, the
writing team recommends that an effort should be made in the
future to develop an appropriate emissions scenario
classification scheme. Chapters 2 and 3 give a more detailed
description of the very wide range of future emissions paths,
their driving forces, and their relationships as reflected in the
literature; the wide rage indicates that their possible
developments are highly uncertain. The sources of inherent
uncertainties range from data and modeling uncertainties
through to inadequate scientific understanding of the
underlying problems.

? During the approval process of the Summary for Policymakers at
the 5"" Session of Working Group III of the IPCC from 8-11 March
2000 in Katmandu, Nepal, it was decided to combine the ALC and
AIG groups into one ""fossil intensive"" group ALFI in contrast to the
non-fossil group AIT, and select two illustrative scenarios from these
two Al groups to facilitate use by modelers and policy makers. This
leads to six scenario groups that constitute the four scenario families,
three of which are in the A1 family. The six groups all have “
illustrative scenarios”, four of which are marker scenarios. All

encompass a significant portion of the underlying uncertainties in the main driving forces. They cover a wide range of key

capita income. The Al scenario family develops into four groups that describe alternative directions of technological
change in the energy system. Please note that in the Summary for Policymakers, two of these groups were merged into
one.?

The A2 storyline and scenario family describes a very heterogeneous world. The underlying theme is self-reliance and
preservation of local identities. Fertility patterns across regions converge very slowly, which results in high population
growth. Economic development is primarily regionally oriented and per capita economic growth and technological change
are more fragmented and slower than in other storylines.

The BI storyline and scenario family describes a convergent world with the same Jow population growth as in the Al
storyline, but with rapid changes in economic structures toward a service and information economy, with reductions in
material intensity, and the introduction of clean and resource-efficient technologies. The emphasis is on global solutions
to economic, social, and environmental sustainability, including improved equity, but without additional climate
initiatives.

The B2 storyline and scenario family describes a world in which the emphasis is on local solutions to economic, social,
and environmental sustainability. It is a world with moderate population growth, intermediate levels of economic
development, and fess rapid and more diverse technological change than in the B{ and A1 storylines. While the scenaric
is also oriented toward environmental protection and social equity, it focuses on local and regional levels.

nature, for which differences in alternative technology
developments translate into large differences in future GHG
emission levels. The Al groups further increased the richness
in different GHG and SO, emissions paths. Indeed, this
variation in the structure of future energy systems in itself
resulted in a range of emissions almost as large as that
generated through the variation of other main driving forces,

independent of each other within each family, but they are
independent across the four families. However, scenarios
within each family vary quite substantially in characteristics
such as the assumptions about availability of fossil-fuel
resources, the rate of energy-efficiency improvements, the
extent of renewable-energy development, and, hence, the
resultant GHG emissions. Thus, after the modeling teams had
quantified the key driving forces and made an effort to
harmonize them with the storylines by adjusting control

prespecified population and gross world product (a few that also share common final energy trajectories are called “fully

additional illustrative scenarios in Al be used to capture the
range of GHG emissions, and these should always be used

the richness of scenario families, groups, markers, and
illustrative and harmonized scenarios) is based on a “neutral”
choice of scenario drivers; no driver is unduly emphasized as
being more important than others. The scenarios do not suggest
that future population growth alone is the driver of future
emissions, nor do they suggest that technological change alone
in any one sector could drive future emissions in one way or the
other. While recognizing the importance of any of these driving
forces per se, this report illustrates the critical role of
relationships and interdependencies between scenario driving
forces. To an extent it is the nature of these relationships that
drives the future more than the possible evolution of any
individual driving forces by itself. In other words, the
uncertainty of the future is not simply parametric, but deeply
functional; uncertainties and incomplete understanding exist
for both. Qualitative scenario storylines add transparency and
consistency to the relationships assumed in any particular
scenario. The storylines also allow for additional interpretation
of scenario results by different user communities.

Chapter 3). The population projections are exogenous input to
all the models used to develop the SRES scenarios. The models
used do not develop population from other assumptions within
the model. Figure 6-2 shows the three population projections in
comparison with the three population projections used in the
IS92 scenarios. Global population ranges between 7 and 15
billion people by 2100 across the scenarios, depending on the
rate and extent of the demographic transition. The insert in

smaller than in the IS92 scenarios, particularly in the
industrialized regions, for which the lowest scenario indicates
a very modest population decline compared to [S92 scenarios.
The greatest uncertainty about future growth lies in the
developing regions across all scenarios in the literature. An
equally pervasive trend across all scenarios is urbanization (see
Chapter 3). Altogether three different population projections
were used in the 26 harmonized scenarios. Other scenarios
explored alternative population projections consistent with the

"The lowest population trajectory is assumed for the Al and BI
scenario families and is based on the low population projection
in Lutz (1996), which combines low fertility with low
mortality and central migration rate assumptions. After
peaking at 8.7 billion in the middle of the 21* century, world
population declines to 7.1 billion by the year 2100. As
discussed in Chapters 3 and 4, this population development is
somewhat higher than the previous low population used in the
IS92 scenarios. The B2 scenario family is based on the UN
median 1998 population projection (UN, 1998). The global
population increases to about 9.4 billion people by 2050 and to
about 10.4 billion by 2100. This population scenario is
characteristic of recent median global population projections,
which describe a continuation of historical trends towards a
completion of the demographic transition that would lead to a
level global population, and is consistent with recent faster
fertility declines in the world together with declining mortality
rates. Hence, the population is somewhat lower than previous
UN median projections, as used in the [S92 scenarios. This
median scenario projects very low population growth in
today’s industrialized countries, with stabilization of growth in
Asia in the second half of the 21* century and in the rest of the
world towards the end of the 21 century. The A2 scenario
family is based on the high population growth of 15 billion by
2100 reported in Lutz (1996), which assumes a significant
decline in fertility for most regions and a stabilization at above
replacement levels. [t falls below the long-term 1998 UN high
projection of 18 billion. It is also lower than in the highest IS92
scenario (17.6 billion by 2100). Nevertheless, this scenario
represents very high population growth compared with that in
current demographic literature. Demographers attach a
probability of more than 90% that actual population will be
lower than the trajectory adopted in the A2 scenario family
(Lutz et al., 1997). A more detailed discussion of the
population projections used to quantify the four scenario

families. Table 6-1 summarizes per capita income for SRES
and IS92 scenarios for the four SRES world regions. SRES
scenarios indicate a smaller difference between the now
industrialized and developing countries compared with the

income “gap” compared with the IS92 scenarios overcomes
one of the major shortcomings of the previous IPCC scenarios

"Although the SRES scenarios span a wide range, still lower
and higher gross world product levels can be found in the
literature (see Chapters 2, 3, and 4). Uncertainties in future
gross world product levels are governed by the pace of future
productivity growth and population growth, especially in
developing regions. Different assumptions on conditions and
possibilities for development “catch-up” and for narrowing per
capita income gaps in particular explain the wide range in
projected future gross world product levels. Given a
qualitatively negative relationship between population growth
and per capita income growth discussed in Chapters 2 and 3,
uncertainties in future population growth rates tend to narrow
the range of associated gross world product projections. High
population growth would, ceteris paribus, lower per capita
income growth, whereas low population growth would tend to
increase it. This relationship is evident in empiric data — high
per capita income countries are generally also those that have
completed their demographic transition. The affluent live long

structure diverges over time. It shows the contributions of

coal, that by oil and gas, and that by all non-fossil sources taken

models distinguish between renewables and nuclear energy).
Each corner of the triangle corresponds to a hypothetical
situation in which all primary energy is supplied by a single
source — oil and gas, coal at the left, and non-fossil sources
(renewables and nuclear) to the right. Historically, the primary
energy structure has evolved clockwise according to the two
“grand transitions” (discussed in Chapter 3) that are shown by
the two segments of the “thick black” curve. From 1850 to
1920 the first transition can be characterized as the substitution
of traditional (non-fossil) energy sources by coal. The share of
coal increased from 20% to about 70%, while the share of non-
fossils declined from 80% to about 20%. The second transition,
from 1920 to 1990, can be characterized as the replacement of
coal by oil and gas (while the share of non-fossils remained
essentially constant). The share of oil and gas increased to
about 50% and the share of coal declined to about 30%.

the same range of structural change as all other scenarios

main structural change occurs between coal on the one hand

Figure 6-3: Global primary energy structure, shares (%) of oil and gas, coal, and non-fossil (zero-carbon) energy sources —
historical development from 1850 to 1990 and in SRES scenarios. Each corner of the triangle corresponds to a hypothetical
situation in which all primary energy is supplied by a single source — oil and gas on the top, coal to the left, and non-fossil
sources (renewables and nuclear) to the right. Constant market shares of these energies are denoted by their respective isoshare
lines. Historical data from 1850 to 1990 are based on Nakicenovié et al. (1998). For 1990 to 2100, alternative trajectories show
the changes in the energy systems structures across SRES scenarios. They are grouped by shaded areas for the scenario
families Al, A2, B1, and B2 with respective markers shown as lines. In addition, the four scenario groups within the Al family
Al, AIC, AIG, and AIT, that explore different technological developments in the energy systems, are shaded individually. In
the SPM, the ALC and AlG scenario groups are combined into the fossil-intensive A{FI scenario group. For comparison the
IS92 scenario series are also shown, clustering along two trajectories (IS92c,d and 1S92a,b,e,f). For mode] results that do not

sufficient to determine the future emissions paths. Different
modeling approaches and different specifications of other
scenario assumptions overshadow the influence of the main
driving forces. A particular combination of driving forces, such
as specified in the Al scenario family, is associated with a
whole range of possible emission paths for energy and
industry. The nature of climate change impacts and adaptation
and mitigation strategies would be fundamentally different
depending on whether emissions are high or low, given a
particular combination of scenario driving forces. Thus, the
implication is that the whole range needs to be considered in
the assessments of climate change, from high emissions and
driving forces to low ones.

"Figure 6-6 shows the range of emissions of the four families
(vertical bars next to each of the four marker scenarios), which
illustrate that the scenarios groups by themselves cover a large
portion of the overall scenario distribution. Together, they
cover much of the range of future emissions, both with respect
to the scenarios in the literature and all SRES scenarios.
Adding all other scenarios increases the covered range. For
example, the SRES scenarios span jointly from the 95""
percentile to just above the 5"" percentile of the distribution of
energy and industry emissions scenarios from the literature.
This illustrates again that they only exclude the most extreme
emissions scenarios found in the literature, which are situated
out in the tails of the distribution. What is perhaps more
important is that cach of the four scenario families covers a
substantial part of this distribution. This leads to a substantial
overlap in the emissions ranges of the four scenario families. In
other words, a similar quantification of driving forces can lead
to a wide range of future emissions and a given level of future
emissions can result from different combinations of driving
forces. This result is of fundamental importance for the
assessments of climate change impacts and possible mitigation
and adaptation strategies. Thus, it warrants some further
discussion.

long-term scenarios in a meaningful manner. In addition, the GWP
approach is not applicable to gases such as SO, and ozone precursors.
"	Text
"Figure 6-6b shows that CO, emissions from deforestation peak
in many SRES scenarios after several decades and
subsequently gradually decline. This pattern is consistent with
many scenarios in the literature and can be associated with
slowing population growth and increasing agricultural
productivity. These allow a reversal of current deforestation
trends, leading to eventual CO, sequestration. Emissions
decline fastest in the Bt family. Only in the A2 family do net
anthropogenic CO, emissions from land use remain positive
through to 2100. As was the case for energy-related emissions,
CO, emissions related to land-use in the Al family cover the
widest range. The range of land-use emissions across the IS92
scenarios is narrower in comparison.
"	Text
"This comparison of some of the SRES scenario characteristics
implies that similar future emissions can result from very
different socio-economic developments, and similar
developments of driving forces can result in different future
emissions. Uncertainties in the future development of key
emission driving forces create large uncertainties in future
emissions, even within the same socio-economic development
paths. Therefore, emissions from each scenario family overlap
substantially with emissions from other scenario families.
Figure 6-6 shows this for CO, emissions. For example,
comparison of the A1B and B2 marker scenarios indicates that
they have similar emissions of about 13.5 and 13.7 GtC by
2100, respectively. The dynamics of the paths, however, are
different so that they have different cumulative CO, emissions
and different emissions of other GHG gases and SO,.
"	Text
"This categorization can guide comparisons using either
scenarios with different driving forces yet similar emissions, or
scenarios with similar driving forces but different emissions,
This characteristic of SRES scenarios also has very important
implications for the assessment of climate-change impacts,
mitigation, and adaptation strategies. Two future worlds with
fundamentally different characteristic features, such as the Al
and B2 marker scenarios, also have different cumulative CO,
emissions, but very similar CO, emissions in 2100. In contrast,
scenarios that are in the same category of cumulative emissions
can have fundamentally different driving forces and different
CO, emissions in 2100, but very similar cumulative emissions.
Presumably, adverse impacts and effective adaptation measures
would vary among the scenarios from different families that
share similar cumulative emissions. but have different
demographic, socio-economic, and technological driving
forces. This is another reason for considering the entire range
of emissions in future assessments of climate change.

"different groups of scenarios that explore different structures of
future energy systems, from carbon-intensive development
paths to high rates of decarbonization. All groups otherwise
share the same assumptions about the main driving forces (see
Section 6.2.3 and, for further detail, Chapters 4 and 5). This
indicates that different structures of the energy system can lead
to basically the same variation in future emissions as generated
by different combinations of the other main driving forces —
population, economic activities, and energy consumption
levels. The implication is that decarbonization of energy
systems — the shift from carbon-intensive to less carbon-
intensive and carbon-free sources of energy — is of similar
importance in determining the future emissions paths as other
driving forces. Sustained decarbonization requires the
development and successful diffusion of new technologies.
Thus investments in new technologies during the coming
decades might have the same order of influence on future
emissions as population growth, economic development, and
levels of energy consumption taken together.

"the scenarios are shown aggregated into seven groups, the four
Al groups and the other three families. The scenarios that
remain outside the seven groups adopted alternative
interpretations of the four scenario storylines. The emission
trajectories (“bands”) of the seven groups display different
dynamics, from monotonic increases to non-linear trajectories
in which there is a subsequent decline from a maximum. The
dynamics of the individual scenarios are also different across
gasses, sectors, or world regions. This particularly diminishes
the significance of focusing scenario categorization on any
given year, such as 2100. In addition, all gases that contribute
to radiative forcing should be considered, but methods of
combining gases such as the use of global warming potentials
(GWP) are appropriate only for near-term GHG inventories.*
In light of these difficulties, the classification approach
presented here uses cumulative CO, emissions between 1990
and 2100. CO, is the dominant GHG and cumulative CO,
emissions are expected to be roughly proportional to CO,
radiative forcing over the time scale of a century. According to
the IPCC SAR, “any eventual stabilised concentration is
governed more by the accumulated anthropogenic CO,
emissions from now until the time of stabilisation than by the
way emissions change over the period” (Houghton et al.,
1996). Therefore, the writing team also grouped the scenarios
according to their cumulative emissions (see Figure 6.8).

uncertainty. Future CH, emissions in the scenarios depend in
part on the consumption of fossil fuels, adjusted for assumed

strongly on scenario-specific, regional demographic and

preferred diets and agricultural practices. For example, it is
noted in Chapter 5 that the observed slowing of the rate of

emissions level off and subsequently decline sooner or later in
the 21* century. This phenomenon is most pronounced in the
A1B marker, in which the fastest growth in the first few
decades is followed by the steepest decline; the 2100 level ends
up slightly below the current emission of 310 Mt CH,. The
range of emissions in Table 6-2b indicate that alternative
developments in energy technologies and resources could yield
a higher range in CH, emissions compared to the “balanced”
technology Al scenario group. In the two fossil fuel intensive
scenario groups (ALC and A1G, combined into the non-fossil
ALFI group in the Summary for Policymakers of this report),
CH, emissions could reach some 735 Mt CH, by 2100,
whereas in the post-fossil ALT scenario group emissions are
correspondingly lower (some 300 Mt CH, by 2100).
Interestingly, the Al scenarios generally have comparatively
low CH, emissions from non-energy sources because of a
combination of low population gfowth and rapid advances in
agricultural productivity. Hence the SRES scenarios extend the
uncertainty range of the IS92 scenario series somewhat toward
lower emissions. However, both scenario sets indicate an upper

structure, and regional spread of the global population will be
reflected in the emissions trajectories, together with
assumptions on diets and improvements in agricultural
practices. Again, as for CH, in the SRES scenarios (see Section
5.4.1 in Chapter 5), continued growth of N,O emissions
emerges only in the A2 scenario, largely because of high
population growth. In the other three marker scenarios,
emissions peak and then decline sooner or later in the course of
the 21 century. Importantly, as the largest anthropogenic
source of N,O (cultivated soils) is already very uncertain in the
base year, all future emissions trajectories are affected by large
uncertainties, especially if calculated with different models, as
is the case in this SRES report. Therefore, the writing team
recommends further research into the sources and modeling of
long-term N,O emissions. Uncertainty ranges are
correspondingly large, and are sometimes asymmetric. For
example, while the range in 2100 reported in all Al scenarios
is between 5 and 10 MtN (7 MtN in the AIB marker), the A2
marker reports 17 MIN in 2100. Other A2 scenarios report
emissions that fall within the range reported for Al (from 8 to
19 MIN in 2100). Thus, different model representations of
processes that lead to N,O emissions and uncertainties in
source strength can outweigh easily any underlying differences
between individual scenarios in terms of population growth,
economic development, etc. Different assumptions with
respect to future crop productivity, agricultural practices, and
associated emission factors, especially in the very populous
regions of the world, explain the very different global emission
levels even for otherwise shared main scenario drivers. Hence,
the SRES scenarios extend the uncertainty range of future
emissions significantly toward higher emissions (4.8 to 20.2

MtC-equivalents given in Table 6-2b varies greatly, because of
differences in both atmospheric lifetime and the radiative effect
per molecule of each gas. The net effect on climate of these
substances is best determined by a calculation of their radiative
forcing — which is the amount by which these gases enhance
the anthropogenic greenhouse effect. The net radiative effect of
all halocarbons, PFCs, and SF, from 1990 to 2100, including a
current estimate of the radiative effect of stratospheric ozone
depletion and subsequent recovery, ranges from 6% to 9% of
the total radiative forcing from all GHGs and SO,. Preliminary

result of international environmental agreements, a

for CFC and HCFC substitutes, a simple methodology of
developing different emissions trajectories consistent with the

Further substitution away from HFCs is assumed to require a
climate policy and is therefore not considered in SRES

other than climate change. For one scenario (A2) no
reductions were assumed, whereas in the other scenarios
intermediary reduction rates and levels were assumed.

to 2375 kt HFC-134a equivalent in IS92. The range of
emissions of HFCs in the SRES scenario is initially generally
lower than in earlier IPCC scenarios because of new insights
about the availability of alternatives to HFCs as replacements
for substances controlled by the Montreal Protocol. In two of
the four scenarios in the report, HFC emissions increase
rapidly in the second half of the 21‘' century, while in two
others the growth of emissions is significantly slowed down or
reversed in that period.

"Second, different assumptions about CFC applications as well
as substitute candidates were developed. These were initially
based on Kroeze and Reijnders (1992) and information given
in Midgley and McCulloch (1999), but updated with the most
recent information from the Joint IPCC/TEAP Expert Meeting
on Options for the Limitation of Emissions of HFCs and PFCs
(WMO/UNEP, 1999) as described below. An important
assumption, on the basis of the latest information from the
industry, is that relatively few Montreal gases will be replaced
fully by HFCs. Current indications are that substitution rates of
CFCs by HFCs will be less than 50% (McCulloch and
Midgley, 1998). In Fenhann (2000) a further technological
development is assumed that would result in about 25% of the
CFCs ultimately being substituted by HFCs (see Table 5-9 in
Chapter 5). This low percentage not only reflects the
introduction of non-HFC substitutes, but also the notion that
smaller amounts of halocarbons will be used in many
applications when changing to HFCs (efficiency gains with
technological change). A general assumption is that the present
trend, not to substitute with high GWP substances (including
PFCs and SF,), will continue. As a result of this assumption,
the emissions reported here may be underestimates, This

As a result, the median from recent sulfur scenarios (see
Chapter 3) is consequently significantly lower compared to
1892, indicating a continual decline in global sulfur emissions
in the long-term. The median and mean of sulfur control
scenarios are almost identical. As mentioned above, even the
highest range of recent sulfur-control scenarios is significantly
below that of comparable, high-demand [S92 scenarios
(IS92a, IS92b, IS92e, and IS92f). The scenarios with the

"A detailed review of long-term global and regional sulfur
emission scenarios is given in Griibler (1998) and summarized
in Chapter 3. The most important new finding from the
scenario literature is recognition of the significant adverse
impacts of sulfur emissions on human health, food production,
and ecosystems. As a result, scenarios published since 1995
generally assume various degrees of sulfur controls to be
implemented in the future, and thus have projections
substantially lower than previous ones, including the IS92
scenario series. Of these, only the two low-demand scenarios
1S92e and [892d fall within the range of more recent long-
term sulfur emission scenarios. A related reason for lower
sulfur emission projections is the recent tightening of sulfur-
control policies in the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) countries, such as the Amendments
of the Clean Air Act in the USA and the implementation of the
Second European Sulfur Protocol. Such legislative changes
were not reflected in previous long-term emission scenarios,
as noted in Alcamo et al. (1995) and Houghton et al. (1995).
Similar sulfur control initiatives due to local air quality
concerns are beginning to impact sulfur emissions also in a
number of developing countries in Asia and Latin America

NO, emission levels rise less. NO, emissions tend to increase
up to 2050 and stabilize thereafter, the result of a gradual
substitution of fossil fuels by alternatives as well as of the
increasing diffusion of NO, control technologies. Low
emission futures are described by various B1 family scenarios,
as well as in the AIT scenario group that describe futures in
which NO, emissions are controlled because of either local air

"A relatively robust trend across all 40 scenarios (see Figure 5-

up to about 2050, with a range of between 190 and 260 Mt.
Beyond 2050, uncertainties increase with respect to both
emission levels and trends. By 2100, the range is between 58
and 552 Mt, which extends the [S92 scenario range of 136 to
403 Mt by 2100 toward both higher and lower emissions (see
Table 6-2b). As for NO, emissions, the upper bounds of
NMVOC emissions are formed by fossil fuel intensive
scenario groups within the Al scenario family (ALC, A1G,
combined into one fossil intensive scenario group ALFI in the
Summary for Policymakers, see also footnote 2), and the
lower bounds by the scenarios within the B1 scenario family.
Characteristic ranges are between 60 and 90 Mt NMVOC by
2100 in the low emissions cluster and between 370 and 550 Mt
NMVOC in the high emissions cluster. All other scenario
families and individual scenarios fall between these two
emissions clusters; the B2 marker scenario (B2- MESSAGE)
closely tracks the median of global NMVOC emissions from
all the SRES scenarios (see Figure 5-10 in Chapter 5).

"The SRES scenario set brackets global anthropogenic sulfur
emissions between 27 and 169 MtS by 2050 and between 11
and 93 MtS by 2100 (see Table 6-2b). The range of emissions
for the four markers is smaller. In contrast, the range of the
1892 scenarios (Pepper et al., 1992; Alcamo et al., 1995) is
substantially higher, starting at 80 MtS and extending all the
way to 200 MtS by 2050 and from 55 to 230 MtS by 2100. The
two Sowest scenarios, IS92c and IS92d, approach the higher
end estimates of the SRES scenarios in 2100, while others are
above the SRES range. As mentioned, this difference reflects
the expected future consequences of recent policies that aim to
achieve a drastic reduction in sulfur emissions in OECD
countries, as well as an anticipated gradual introduction of
sulfur controls in developing regions in the long-term, as
reported in the underlying literature (see Chapter 3). In other
words, all SRES scenarios assume sulfur control measures,
although the uncertainty in timing and magnitude of
implementation is reflected in the variation across different
scenarios. Importantly, SRES scenarios assume sulfur controls
only and do not assume any additional climate policy
measures. Nevertheless, one important implication of this
varying pattern of sulfur emissions is that the historically
important, but uncertain, negative radiative forcing of sulfate
aerosols may decline in the very long run. This view is also
confirmed by model calculations reported in Subak e¢ al.
(1997) and Nakicenovié et al. (1998), on the basis of recent
long-term GHG and sulfur emission scenarios.

the number of models that represent all the emission source
categories is limited and modeling and data uncertainties, such
as emission factors, are considerable. As a result, CO emission
estimates across scenarios are highly model specific and future
emission levels overlap considerably between the four SRES
scenario families (see Table 6-2b). By 2100, emissions range
between 363 and 3766 Mt CO, a considerably larger

"Alternative combinations of driving forces can lead to
similar levels and structure of energy and land-use
patterns, as illustrated by different scenarios and groups.
Hence, even for a given scenario outcome (e.g. in terms
of GHG emissions) there are alternative combinations
of driving forces and pathways that could lead to that
outcome, For instance, significant global changes could
result from a scenario of high population growth, even
if per capita incomes rise only modestly, as well as from.
a scenario in which a rapid demographic transition (to
low population levels) coincides with high rates of

Important possibilities for further bifurcations in future
development trends exist within one scenario family,
even when particular values are adopted for the
important scenario driving force variables to illustrate a
particular development path. The four technology

alternative development paths with similar
quantifications of the main driving forces.

emissions across the range of SRES scenarios, time
periods, world regions, and sectors reflects recent
scenario literature.

Describing potential future developments involves
inherent ambiguities and uncertainties. One and only
one possible development path (as alluded to, for
instance, in concepts such as “business-as-usual
scenario”) simply does not exist alone. And even for
each alternative development path described by any
given scenario, there are numerous combinations of
driving forces and numeric values that can be consistent
with a particular scenario description. The numeric
precision of any model result should not distract from
the basic fact that uncertainty abounds. However, the
multi-model approach increases the value of the SRES
scenario set, since uncertainties in the choice of model
input assumptions can be separated more explicitly
from the specific model behavior and related modeling
uncertainties.

Any scenario has subjective elements and is open to
various interpretations. While the writing team as a
whole has no preference for any of the scenarios, and
has no judgment as to the probability or desirability of
different scenarios, the open process and _ initial
reactions to draft versions of this report show that
individuals and interest groups do have such
judgments. The writing team hopes that this will
stimulate an open discussion in the policy making arena
about potential futures and choices that can be made in
the context of climate change response. For the
scientific community, the SRES scenario exercise has
led to the identification of a number of recom-

the understanding of potential developments of socio-
economic driving forces and their interactions, and the
associated GHG emissions. A summary of main

The important uncertainties may be different in different applications — for example climate modeling; assessment of
impacts, vulnerability, mitigation, and adaptation options; and policy analysis. Climate modelers may want to cover the
range reflected by the cumulative emissions categories. To assess the robustness of options in terms of impacts,
vulnerability, and adaptation may require scenarios with similar emissions but different socio-economic characteristics,
as reflected by the scenario groups. For mitigation analysis, variation in both emissions and socio-economic
characteristics may be necessary. For analysis at the national or regional scale, the most appropriate scenarios may be
those that best reflect specific circumstances and perspectives.

There is no single most likely, “central” , or “best-guess” scenario, either with respect to other SRES scenarios or to the
underlying scenario literature. Probabilities or likelihoods are not assigned to individual SRES scenarios. None of the
SRES scenarios represents an estimate of a central tendency for all driving forces and emissions, such as the mean or
"	List
"The four scenario families each have a narrative storyline and consist of 40 scenarios developed by six modeling groups.
The 40 scenarios cover the full range of GHGs and SO, emissions consistent with the underlying range of driving forces
from scenario literature.

The 40 SRES scenarios fall into different groups — the three scenario families A2, B1, and B2, plus four groups within
the Al scenario family, two of which (AIC and AIG) have been combined into one fossil-intensive group A1FI in the
Summary for Policymakers; see also footnote 2. The four Al groups are distinguished by their technological emphasis —
on coal (AIC), oil and gas (A1G), non-fossil energy sources (A1T), or a balance across all sources (A1).

The scenarios are grouped into four categories of cumulative CO, emissions, which indicate that scenarios with different
driving forces can lead to similar cumulative emissions and those with similar driving forces can branch out into different
categories of cumulative emissions.

Four from 40 scenarios are designated as marker scenarios that are characteristic of the four scenarios families. Together
with the two additional illustrative scenarios selected from the scenario groups in the Al family, they capture most of the
emissions and driving forces spanned by the full set of the scenarios.

There is no single central or “best guess” scenario, and probabilities or likelihood are not assigned to individual scenarios.
Instead, the writing team recommends that the smallest set of scenarios used should include the four designated marker
scenarios and the two additional illustrative scenarios selected from the scenario groups in the Al family.

Distinction between scenarios that envisage stringent environmental policies and those that include direct climate policies
was very difficult to make, a difficulty associated with many definitional and other ambiguities.

All scenarios describe futures that are generally more affluent than today. Many of the scenarios envisage a more rapid
convergence in per capita income ratios in the world compared to the IS92 scenarios while, at the same time, they jointly
cover a wide range of GHG and SO, emissions.

Emissions profiles are more dynamic than the IS92 scenarios, which reflects changes in future emissions trends for some
scenarios and GHG species.

The levels of GHG emissions are generally lower than the 1$92 levels, especially toward the end of the 21‘ century, while
emissions of SO,, which have a cooling effect on the atmosphere, are significantly lower than in IS92.

Alternative combinations of main scenario driving forces can lead to similar levels of GHG emissions by the end of the
21* century. Scenarios with different underlying assumptions can result in very similar climate changes.

Technology is at least as important a driving force of GHG emissions as population and economic development across
the set of 40 SRES scenarios.

emphasis to involve strong participation from developing countries.

Promote activities within and outside the IPCC to extend the SRES multi-baseline and multi-model approach in future
assessments of climate change impacts, adaptation, and mitigation.

Initiate new programs to assess GHG emissions from Jand use and sources of emissions other than energy-related CO,

more regional and sectorial detail than time and resources allowed SRES to achieve.

median, and none should be interpreted as such. The statistics associated with the frequency distributions of SRES
scenarios do not represent the likelihood of their occurrence. The writing team cautions against constructing a central,
“best-estimate” scenario from the SRES scenarios; instead it recommends use of the SRES scenarios as they are.
Concerning large-scale climate models, the writing team recommends that the mininum set of SRES scenarios should
include the four designated marker scenarios and the two additional illustrative scenarios selected from the scenario
groups in the Al family. At the minimum (a) a simulation for one and the same SRES marker or illustrative scenario
should be performed by every TAR climate model for a given stabilization ceiling, and (b) the set of simulations
performed by the TAR climate models and stabilization runs for a given ceiling should include all four of the SRES
marker scenarios.

The driving forces and emissions of each SRES scenario should be used together. To avoid internal inconsistencies,
components of SRES scenarios should not be mixed. For example, the GHG emissions from one scenario and the SO,
emissions from another scenario, or the population from one and economic development path from another, should not
be combined.

The SRES scenarios can provide policy makers with a long-term context for near-term decisions. This implies that they
are not necessarily well suited for the analysis of near-term developments. When analyzing mitigation and adaptation
options, the user should be aware that although no additional climate initiatives are included in the SRES scenarios,
various changes have been assumed to occur that would require other policy interventions. “

More detailed information on assumptions, inputs, and the results of the 40 SRES scenarios should be made available at
a web site and on a CD-ROM. Regular maintenance of the SRES web site is

"It is proposed that new scenarios should be developed through
a coordinated effort that draws upon the expertise of all
researchers in the relevant community. A three-step process is
envisaged. First, key input assumptions would be reviewed
and provided to modelers. Second, modelers would be asked
to construct emissions scenarios based on the input
assumptions provided. Finally, the model results will be used
to develop new emissions scenarios in the form of average
results for participating models or results from a
representative model.

"In many ways the [S92 scenarios were pathbreaking. They
were the first global scenarios to provide estimates of the full
suite of greenhouse gases. At the time, they were the only
scenarios to provide emission trajectories for SO,, Alcamo et
al. (1995) reviewed the scenarios and found that the fossil fuel
carbon emissions trajectories spanned more than half of the
open literature emissions scenarios reviewed. Other emissions
trajectories had received Jess scrutiny in the open literature and,
while the IS92 cases were not dissimilar to those in the open
literature, the open literature was extremely sparse in many
instances.
"	Text
"A writing team would be established to consider key input
assumptions (such as population projections and technologic
change) and emissions from specific sources (such as SO,
emissions and CO, emissions due to land-use change),
possibly with the assistance of specialized task groups. The
writing team will also stipulate a set of geographical reporting
regions, reporting years, units of measure, etc., designed to
provide climate modelers, impact assessment analysts, and
other users with the detail they need for their work. Finally, the
writing team would ensure that the range of results reflects the
underlying uncertainty and, to the extent possible, that the
assumptions for specific scenarios are internally consistent.
"	Text
"Scenario development will be an open process. There will be
no “official” model. There will be no “expert teams,” Any
research group with the capability of preparing scenarios for
any region can participate, This means that, while modeling
teams which employ global coverage will be able to
participate, so too will regional modelers. By opening the
process in this way, developing and developed region
researchers with local expertise can participate even if they do
not have global coverage. Modeling teams will be provided
with information on the input assumptions and other necessary
information such as, for example, the world oil price, to
regional modeling teams.

providing alternative emissions trajectories spanning the years
1990 through 2100 for greenhouse-related gases, Carbon
dioxide (CO,), carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH,), nitrous
oxide (N,O), nitrogen oxyde (NO,), and sulfur dioxide (SO,).
These scenarios were intended for use by atmospheric and
climate scientists in the preparation of scenarios of
atmospheric composition and climate change. The work
updated and extended earlier work prepared for the IPCC first
assessment report. These six scenarios are referred to as the
IS92 scenarios.
"	Text
"Much has changed in the period following the creation of the
IS92 scenarios. Sulfur emissions have been recognized as a
more important radiative forcing factor than other non-CO,
greenhouse-related gases, and some regional control policies
have been adopted. Restructuring in the states of Eastern
Europe and the Former Soviet Union has had far more
powerful effects on economic activity and emissions than were
foreseen in the [S92 scenarios. For some regions these
scenarios are not representative of those found in the literature.
The advent of integrated assessment ([A) models has made it
possible to construct self-consistent emissions scenarios that
jointly consider the interactions between energy, economy, and
land-use changes.

"The ASF energy model consists of four end-use sectors
(residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation). These
sectors consume liquid fuels, solid fuels, gaseous fuels, and
electricity. An electricity generation sector converts liquid
fuels, solid fuels, gaseous fuels, nuclear energy, hydro energy,
and solar energy into electricity. A synfuels sector converts
coal and/or biomass into either a liquid or gaseous fuel. There
is no direct consumption of solar energy or biomass by the end-
use sectors.

"The Asian Pacific Integrated Model (AIM) is a large-scale
computer simulation model for scenario analyses of
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the impacts of global
warming in the Asian~Pacific region. This model is being
developed mainly to examine global warming response
measures in the region, but it is linked to a world model so that
it is possible to make global estimates. AIM comprises three
main models — the GHG emission model (AIM/emission), the
global climate change model (AIM/climate), and the climate

approaches to emissions scenario modeling and the different
integrated assessment frameworks used in the scenario

"The ASF GHG emissions model uses outputs of the energy,
agricultural, and deforestation models to estimate GHG
emissions in each ASF region. These emissions are estimated
by mapping GHG emission sources to the corresponding
emission drivers and changing them according to changes in
these drivers. For example, CH, emissions from landfills are
mapped to population, while CO, emissions from cement
production are mapped to GNP.

"In the ASF model balancing the supply and demand for energy
is achieved ultimately by adjusting energy prices. Energy
prices differ by region to reflect regional market conditions,
and by type of energy to reflect supply constraints, conversion
costs, and the value of the energy to end users. ASF estimates
the supply—demand balance by an iterative search technique to
determine supply prices. These supply prices, which energy
producers charge for the fuel at the wellhead or at the mine, are
used to estimate the secondary energy prices in each region.
These secondary prices are based on the supply price for the
marginal export region, the interregional transportation cost.
refining and distribution costs, and regional tax policies, For
electricity, the secondary prices reflect the relative proportions
of each fuel used to produce the electricity, the secondary
prices of those fuels, the non-fossil costs of converting the fuels
into electricity, and the conversion efficiency.

"The scenario formulation process starts with exogenous
assumptions about population and per capita economic growth
by region. Energy demand (defined at the useful energy level)
is derived using the Scenario Generator (SG) model, a dynamic
model of future economic and energy development. It
combines extensive historical data about economic
development and energy systems with empirically estimated
equations of trends to determine future structural change. For
each scenario, SG generates future paths of energy use
consistent with historical dynamics and with the specific
scenario features (e.g., high or moderate economic growth,
tapid or more gradual energy intensity improvements).

"The impacts of energy price changes on energy demand and
gross domestic product (GDP) growth are estimated by iterating
shadow prices from MESSAGE and energy demands from the
MACRO model. The iteration is repeated until energy
intensities and GDP growth rates are consistent with the output
of the SG model adopted as exogenous input assumptions at the
beginning of the scenario formulation process. The demand
reductions caused by increasing energy prices in the B2 marker
compared to a hypothetical case with constant energy prices
were calculated with MACRO. Compared to this hypothetical
case the price-induced energy demand savings in the B2 marker
are 8% by 2020, 23% by 2050, and 30% by 2100. Table IV-4
gives the shadow prices for international trade for gas, oil, and
coal in the B2 marker. Table [V-5 summarizes the regional

"Energy costs in the model consist of energy production and
utilization costs. Market prices are determined endogenously
on the basis of model-calculated shadow prices. Among
various parameters, the extraction costs of fossil fuel resources
and energy conversion cost coefficients contribute
substantially to determining the model’s energy mix and
emissions, The latest model version, MARIA-8, applied
Rogner’s estimates on fossil resource availability (Rogner,
1997). For the sake of simplicity, the fossil resource and
reserve categories are aggregated into two classes, assuming a
quadratic production function to interpolate the relationships
between resource occurrences and extraction costs.
Corresponding model parameters are summarized in Table IV-
6. The cost coefficients of energy conversion technologies are
basically extracted from the GLOBAL 2100 model (Manne
and Richels, 1992). The basic values used in the case of the B2
scenario are illustrated in Table IV-7, and important model
parameters deployed for MARIA’s other SRES scenario
quantifications are shown in Table IV-8. Other energy-related
cost parameters correspond to renewable energy sources,
methanol and ethanol processes, nuclear fuel recycle, carbon
sequestration, etc. They are described in more detail in Mori

"The energy supply sector provides both renewable (hydro,
solar, and biomass) and non-renewable (coal, oil, gas, and
nuclear) resources. The cost of the fossil resources relates to
the resource base by grade, the cost of production (both
technical and environmental), and to historical production
capacity. The introduction of a graded resource base for fossil
fuel allows the model to test explicitly the importance of fossil
fuel resource constraints as well as to represent unconventional
fuels such as shale oil and methane hydrates. For
unconventional fuels only small amounts are available at low
costs, but large amounts are potentially available at high cost,
or after extensive technology development. Fuel-specific rates
of technical change are available for primary fuel production
and conversion, as are technical change coefficients for each

"Most of the total of 416 scenarios focus on energy-related CO,
emissions (256), Only three models estimated land-use related
emissions — the ASF model, the IMAGE 2 model, and the AIM
model. Very few scenarios considered global SO, emissions.
"	Text
"The writing team recommends that this database or a new
revised one should also be maintained by some institution in
the future to facilitate comparisons and assessments of
emissions scenarios. However, this would require additional
resources.
"	Text
"Each individual data entry is stored in the DATAMOM. Using
the relational structure, it is possible to call data from within
any of four main fields (Source ID, Scenario ID, Region ID, or
Variable) using a number of subcategories specific to the
individual fields. For example, the Source ID data entry field
has the following subcategories:
"	Text
"Given the diversity of data types that must be accommodated,
the database was designed with a relational database structure
(using MS Access ‘97). The data represent large samples, and
it is important that they be stored according to a structure that
also allows the relationships between different data types to be
represented and stored. A detailed description of the database
structure is given in Morita and Lee (1998).
"	Text
"The main sources of data used in ESD were International
Energy Workshop Polls (Manne and Schrattenholzer, 1995,
1996, 1997), Energy Modeling Forum (EMF-14 comparison
studies) data, the previous database compiled for the IPCC
Supplement Report, “Climate Change 1994” (Alcamo et al.,
1995), which examined emission scenarios produced prior to
1994, and individual emission scenarios collected by the SRES
writing team. The current database used in this report includes
the results of a total of 416 scenarios from 171 sources, Most
of these scenarios date after 1994.
"	Text
"These emission scenarios have been quantified mainly using
computer simulation models, which in turn utilize many
assumptions on factors such as population growth, gross
domestic product (GDP) growth, technology efficiency
improvements, land-use changes, and the energy resource base.
The assumptions used in incorporating these factors often
differ between simulations, as do the actual factors represented
in the simulations. As a result, the database was designed to
organize and store the input assumptions behind the scenarios
as well as GHG emissions and other output.

"	List
"The SRES Emission Scenario Database (ESD) was developed
to manage and access a large number of data sets and emissions
scenarios documented in the literature. The SRES Terms of
Reference call for the assessment of emissions scenarios in the
literature (see Appendix I). The database was developed for
SRES by the National Institute for Environmental Studies
(NIES) of Japan and can be accessed via the ftp site www-
cger.nies.go,jp/cger-e/db/ipcc.html. This section summarizes
the database structure and the data collection for the database.
Chapter 2 gives further detail about the quantitative assessment
of the scenarios in the database. At the time of writing the
database included 416 scenarios from 171 sources.
"	Text
"The main purpose behind the development of the new database
is to make it easier to manage and utilize the vast amounts of
data related to emission scenarios of greenhouse gases
(GHGs), which include carbon dioxide (CO,), nitrous oxide
(N,O), methane (CH,), sulfur oxides (SO,), and related gases,
(such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NO,), and
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). The need for such a database is a
function of both the increasing number of emission scenarios
(because of increasing political and research interests in this
topic) and the necessity to identify the strengths and
weaknesses of current scenarios (to allow research to be
focused on the most crucial or under-investigated areas).
"	Text
"The database has the primary function of acting as a data
storage tool, and as an interface that will allow the user easy
access to the data sets contained therein. Thus, it only provides
data, and analyses are conducted using other tools such as
spreadsheets. However, the relational structure of the database
makes it possible to call up comparable data sets across the key
fields, giving maximum flexibility in manipulation, extraction,
and presentation of all the data in the database. Similarly, there
is great flexibility in importing new data, or making a data set
from the database using combinations of specific sources,
specific scenarios (or categories), specific regions, and specific
variables, The extraction screen in Figure V-1, for example,
shows the settings used to extract all information on all
scenarios that are generated with the AIM Japan source model
and to examine global sea level rise.

area of scenarios, for which views on the plausibility of various
aspects of the described futures and their interactions can differ
between regions, between different sectors of society, and

' The IMAGE-results for the A2 and B2 scenarios are based on preliminary model experiments carried out in March 1998. As a consequence
of limited resources it has not been possible to rerun these experiments. Hence, the IMAGE team is not able to provide background data and
details for these scenario calculations and the population and economic growth assumptions are not fully harmonized, as they have been for

the IMAGE A1 and B1 scenarios.

The emissions are all standardized to common 1990 and 2000 values (see Box 5-1).

The chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are only available for the World as total. At the
regional level only hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) emissions were estimated. At the World level the row CFC/HFCIHCFC
represents an aggregation of all CFCs, HCFCs, and HFCs (using SAR GWPs).

Table footnotes give additional explanations for various scenarios.

During the approval process of the Summary for Policymakers at the 5th Session of Working Group III of the IPCC from
8-11 March 2000 in Katmandu, Nepal, it was decided to combine the AIC and A1G groups into one ""fossil intensive’
group ALFI in contrast to the non-fossil group AIT, and select two illustrative scenarios from these two Al groups to
facilitate use by modellers and policy makers. Together with the scenario groups A1B, A2, B1, B2, this leads to siy
scenario groups that constitute the four scenario families. The marker scenarios ALB-AIM, A2, B1 and B2 as well as the
illustrative scenarios AlFI-MiniCAM and AIT-MESSAGE are indicated in the Tables. All scenarios are equally sound.

A measurement technique to define the relative contribution

direct and indirect effects are considered. (Indirect effects
include changes in atmospheric chemistry such as ozone
formation and changes in stratospheric water vapor.) CO, has
been assigned a GWP of 1, against which all other GHGs are
compared. For example, methane (CH,) has a GWP that is
currently estimated to be about 21 times greater than that of

"A procedure to ease comparability of model results by
adopting common (exogenous) input assumptions. Through
harmonization, differences in emissions outcomes resulting
from differences in model input assumptions (e.g. exogenous
population growth) can be separated from differences that
arise from different internal model parametrizations (e.g. of
the dynamics of technological change). The scenarios
reported here can be classified into three categories: “fully
harmonized” scenarios share population, GDP, and final
energy use assumptions at the level of the four SRES regions
(and hence also at the global level) between 1990 and 2100
within prespecified bounds. “Globally harmonized” scenarios
share global population and GDP assumptions at the global
level for the 1990 to 2100 period within prespecified bounds
(deviations in one 10-year interval are not considered). “Other
scenarios” have adopted alternative assumptions for
population and GDP than the ones suggested for scenario
harmonization.

the treaty states an aim by Annex I countries to return these
emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. The treaty took
effect in March 1994 upon the ratification of more than 50
countries; a total of some 160 nations have now ratified. In
March 1995, the UNFCCC held the first session of the COP,
the supreme body of the Convention, in Berlin. Its Secretariat
