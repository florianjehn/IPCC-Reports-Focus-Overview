PREFACE

When the Intergovemmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) completed its
first Impacts Assessment in 1990 ic
became clear that much more work
was needed if a credible global picture
was to be drawn of the potential effects
of climate change. In particular, the
Assessment revealed how difficult it
was to compare impacts in different
regions and economic sectors that had
been assessed using different methods.
A compatible set of methods was
necded to yield comparable regional
and sectoral impact assessments.

Working Group II of the IPCC there-
fore established an expert group to
develop some guidelines for the assess-
ment of impacts of climate change.
The work of this group resulted in the
publication in 1992 of an initial report
entitled Preliminary Guidelines for
Assessing Impacts of Climate Change
(Carter et al., 1992).

The major objective in producing and
distributing that report was to solicit
comments and suggestions for an
improved set of guidelines that could
be tabled and reviewed as part of the
IPCC Second Assessment. The pre-
sent report is the product of that pro-
cess. It should be considered as a set
of technical guidelines for the scien-
tist, which does not seek to prescribe
a single preferred method but a range
of methods, some of which may be
miore suitable than others to the task
in hand, but which can yield broadly
comparable results. The United
Nations Environment Programme is
currently developing a set of
Workbooks, designed to translate the
technical procedures outlined here
into practical methods of impact and
adaptation assessment at the country
and sectoral level.

The authors acknowledge the help of
the IPCC Expert Group on
Guidelines, the Lead Authors
involved in the IPCC WGII Second
Assessment, the reviewers and the
governments of the United Kingdom
and Japan in the preparation and
printing of this report. Technical sup-

In the physical sciences, a standard method of testing hypotheses
or of evaluating processes of cause and effect is through direct
experimentation. In the context of climate impact and adaptation
assessment, however, experimentation has only a limited applica-
tion. Clearly it is not possible physically to simulate large-scale
systems such as the global climate. Only where the scale of
impact is manageable, the exposure unit measurable, and the
environment controllable, can experiments be usefully conducted
(for example, gas enrichment experiments with plants).

One of the major goals of climate impact assessment, especially
concerning aspects of future climatic change, is the prediction of
future impacts. A main focus of much recent work has been on
impact projections, using an array of mathematical models to
extrapolate into the future. First-order effects of climate are usu-
ally assessed using biophysical models, second- and higher-order
effects using a range of biophysical, economic and qualitative
models. Finally, attempts have also been made at comprehensive
assessments using integrated systems models.

The availability of data is probably the major limitation in most
impact and adaptation assessment studies. The collection of new
data is an important element of some studies, particularly for
monitoring purposes regarding expected climate changes, but
most rely on existing sources. Thus, before embarking on a
detailed assessment, it is important to identify the main features
of the data requirements, namely the variables for which data are
needed, the time period, spatial coverage and resolution of the
required data, the sources and format of the data and their quan~
tity and quality, and the data availability, cost and delivery time.
"	Text
"The selection of a time horizon for study is also influenced by the
goals of the assessment. For example, in studies of industrial
impacts the planning horizons may be 5—10 years, while investiga-
tions of tree growth may require a 100-year perspective.
However, as the time horizon increases, the ability to accurately
project future trends declines rapidly. Most climate projections
and scenarios rely on general circulation models (GCMs) which
are subject to uncertainties. Projections of socio-economic factors
such as population, economic development and technological
change need to be made for periods exceeding 15-20 years.

The time horizon selected depends primarily on the goals of the
assessment. However, there are obvious limits on the ability to
project into the future. Climate projections, since they are a key
element of climate impact studies, define one possible outer
limit on impact projections. GCM estimates seldom extend
beyond about 100 years, due to the uncertainties attached to
such long-term projections and to constraints on computational
resources. This fixes an outer horizon at about 2100. In many
economic assessments on the other hand, projections may not
be reliable for more than a few years ahead.

The development of a baseline describing conditions without cli-

mate change is crucial, for it is this baseline against which all pro-
jected impacts are measured. It is highly probable that future
changes in other environmental factors will occur even in the
absence of climate change, which may be of importance for an
exposure unit. Examples, as appropriate, include changes in land-
use, changes in groundwater level and changes in air, water and
soil pollution. Most factors are related to, and projections should
be consistent with trends in socio-economic factors. Greenhouse
gas concentrations may also change, but these would usually be
linked to climate (which is assumed unchanged here).

It is important to ensure that future climate, environment and
socio-economic projections are mutually consistent over space
and time. It is important to be clear about (i) the relative timing
of increases in greenhouse gas concentrations and climate
change and (ii) the relative timing of a 2 x CO, compared to a
2x CO, ‘equivalent’ atmosphere'. With regard to the former,
there is a lag time of several decades in the response of the cli-
mate system to increases in greenhouse gas concentrations. With
regard to the latter, a 2 x CO, ‘equivalent’ atmosphere occurs
carlier than a 2 x CO, atmosphere because gases such as CH,
N,O, and troposphere O, also contribute to radiative forcing.

The testing of predictive models is, arguably, the most critical stage
of an impact assessment. Mast studies rely almost exclusively on the
use of models to estimate future impacts. Thus, it is crucial for the
credibility of the research that model performance is tested rigor-
ously, Standard procedures should be used to evaluate models, but
these may need to be modified to accommodate climate change.
Two main procedures are recommended: validation and sensitivity
analysis. Validation involves the comparison of model predictions
with real world observations to test model performance. Sensitivity
analysis evaluates the effects on model performance of altering its
structure, parameter values, or values of its input variables.

A simple method of specifying a future climate is to adjust the

manner. Adjustments might include, for example, changes in

Temporal analogues are of two types: those based on past
instrumental observations (usually within the last century) and
those based on proxy data, using palaeoclimatic indicators such as

distant past geological records), The main problem with this tech-
nique concerns the physical mechanism and boundary conditions
that would almost certainly be different between a warmer cli-

In order to conduct experiments to assess the impacts of climate
change, it is first necessary to obtain a quantitative representation of
the changes in climate themselves. No method yet exists of provid-

to specify a nuniber of plausible future climates. These are referred
to as ‘climatic scenarios’, and they are selected to provide climatic
data that are spatially compatible, mutually consistent, freely avail-

Three dimensional numerical models of the global climate sys-

are the only credible tool currently available for simulating the
physical processes that determine global climate. Although sim-
pler models have also been used to simulate the radiative effects
of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, only general citcu-
lation models (GCMs), possibly in conjunction with nested
regional models, offer the possibility to provide estimates of
regional climate change, which are required in impact analysis.

Recent work has focused on fashioning more realistic exper-
iments with GCMs, specifically, simulations of the response of
climate to a transient forcing. These simulations offer several
advantages over equilibrium-response experiments. First, the
specifications of the atmospheric perturbation are more realistic,
involving a continuous (transient) change over time in GHG
concentrations. Second, the representation of the oceans is more
realistic, the most recent simulations coupling atmospheric mod-
els to dynamical ocean models. Finally, transient simulations
provide information on the rate as well as the magnitude of cli-

GCMs produce estimates of climatic variables for a regular

network of grid points across the globe. Results from about 20
GCMs have been reported to date (e.g., see IPCC, 1990 and
1992). However, these estimates are highly uncertain because
of some important weaknesses of GCMs. These include: 1)
poor model representation of cloud processes, 2) a coarse spatial
resolution (at best employing grid cells of some 250 km hori-
zontal dimension), 3) generalized topography, disregarding
some locally important features and 4) a simplified representa-
tion of land-atmosphere and ocean-atmosphere interactions. As
a result, GCMs are currently unable accurately to reproduce
even the seasonal pattern of present-day climate at a regional
scale. Thus, GCM outputs represent, at best, broad-scale sets of
possible future climatic conditions and should not be regarded

as predictions.

GCMs have been used to conduct two types of experiment
for estimating future climate: equilibrium-response and
transient-forcing experiments. The majority of experiments have
been conducted to evaluate the equilibrium response of the
global climate to an abrupt increase (commonly, a doubling) of
atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide. A measure that is
widely used in the intercomparison of various GCMs, is the cli-
mate sensitivity parameter. This is defined as the global mean
equilibrium surface air temperature change that occurs in
response to an increase in radiative forcing due to a doubling of
atmospheric CO, concentration (or equivalent increases in other
greenhouse gases). Values of the parameter obtained from cli-
mate model simulations generally fall in the range 1.5-4.5°C
(IPCC, 1992). Knowledge of the climate sensitivity can be use-

ful in constructing climate change scenarios from GCMs.

Risk analysis deals with uncertainty in terms of the risk of
impact. Risk is defined as the product of the probability of an
event and its effect on an exposure unit. Since it is extreme
events that produce the most significant impacts, there is value
in focusing on the changing probability of climatic extremes and
of their impacts. Another form of risk analysis, decision analysis,
is used to evaluate response strategies to climate change. It can
be used co assign likelihoods to different climatic scenarios,
identifying those response strategies that would provide the flex-
ibility, at least cost, (minimizing expected annual damages), that

Changes in environmental conditions not due to climatic
factors should already have been incorporated in the devel-
opment of the environmental trends in the absence of cli-
mate changes, the only changes in these trends to be incor-
porated here are those due solely to climate change. The
two factors most commonly required in assessments are
greenhouse gas concentrations and sea level rise. Future
changes in these are still under discussion, but the estimates
reported by the IPCC may serve as a useful basis for con-
structing scenarios (IPCC, 1990). Other factors that are
directly affected by climate (such as river flows, runoff, ero-
sion) would probably require full impact assessments of their
own, although some might be incorporated as ‘automatic
adjustments’ in projections.

Variations in seasonal weather patterns are as much a feature of
the modern world as they were in historical times and the effects
of such variability are manifest across a range of natural systems
and human activities. Until recently, these variations have been
assumed to represent natural fluctuations about an essentially sta-
ble average climate. However, the observation that concentra-
tions of certain trace gases in the atmosphere have been increas-
ing rapidly, primarily as a result of human activities, has led to
the realisation that changes in atmospheric composition are capa-
ble of affecting the surface climate of the earth.

Observed increases in GHG concentrations are thought to
be altering the radiation balance of the earth, warming the sur-
face and affecting the atmospheric circulation. It is this antici-
pated global warming of climate, the ‘enhanced greenhouse
effect’, that has recently become the subject of great concern
both locally and internationally. At a global scale, the rate and
magnitude of predicted changes in climate are unprecedented in
historical times, thus raising the question of their likely effects
on physical processes, natural ecosystems and human activities
and what, if any, measures there are for preventing or mitigating
the more serious impacts.

The trace gases, especially carbon dioxide, methane, chlo-
rofluorocarbons (CFCs) and nitrous oxide, have the property
of permitting the fairly free passage of short wavelength solar
radiation from the sun through to the earth’s surface, but
absorbing the re-radiated radiation (at lower temperatures and
longer wavelengths) from the earth, With the exception of
CFCs, which are human-made, the natural occurrence of these
gases in the atmosphere (along with water vapour, another
strong absorber of terrestrial radiation) has maintained the
earth’s surface at an average temperature some 33°C higher
than would be the case in their absence. Analogous to the
effect of glass in a grecnhouse, this mechanism has become
known as the ‘greenhouse effect’, and the gases as greenhouse
gases (GHGs).

The term ‘climate impact assessment’ is used hereafter to
refer to assessments both of the impacts of climatic variability and
change and of possible adaptations to these. The report outlines a
basic framework for the study of climate~environment-society
interactions, with a particular emphasis on assessing the impacts
of possible future changes in climate due to the enhanced green-
house effect. Experience with assessing the social and. economic
impacts of climatic change is at present limited, while generalized
miethods for evaluating adaptation strategies for changing climate
do not yet exist. Thus, these guidelines represent an early effort
at formalizing some of these methods into workable procedures,
and are amenable to refinement and development in future years.

Ty order to follow this hierarchical approach assumptions are
required at each Jevel of analysis. Inevitably, accompanying
these assumptions are uncertainties, which may themselves
propagate through the system. Given the large uncertainties, the
exclusion of other influencing factors and the lack of considera-
tion of possible feedback effects, ic is rare that such a formal
methodology can be followed successfully in impact assessment.

The impact approach is usually adopted for studies of indi-
vidual activities or organisms in order to establish ‘dose-
tesponse’ functions, but it is also applied to sectoral studies
where impacts may propagate through a hierarchy of levels.
Thus, direct impacts represent the direct biophysical effects of
climate on organisms or activities (¢.g., on plants, animals, heat-
ing demand, water). The direct effects lead, in turn, to indirect
impacts (e.g., changes in grass growth leading to changes in live-
stock productivity). The chain of impacts may then extend to
higher-order economic and social impacts (e.g., changes in farm
income, changes in national agricultural production, changes in
farm employment).

ONE eee
The simplest approach follows a straightforward ‘cause and
effect’ pathway whereby a climatic event acting on an exposure
umit has an impact (Figure 1). In Jayperson’s terms it can be
thought of as an ‘IfThen-What’ approach: if the climate were
co alter like this then what would be its impacts? In adopting the
approach it is assumed that the effect of other non-climatic fac-
tors on the exposure unit can be held constant. Where this
assumption is justified, (for example, in biological studies of pris-
tine environments not subject to any non-climatic changes), the
approach can be informative. However, the narrow focus on the
effects of climate alone on human activities is also a major weak-
ness of the approach. Another problem is that the whole assess~
ment is reliant on the initial choice of a climatic event, which is
not always selected according to criteria that are relevant co the
climate-sensitivity of the exposure unic. Finally, a major draw-
back of this approach is an inability to assign a likelihood to the

assumed changes in climatic factors.

There are several different reasons for conducting a climate
impact assessment. First, there is a need to evaluate how climate
affects human activities and well-being and natural systems along
with estimates of the uncertainties surrounding these effects.
The effects may be physical (e.g., on water availability), biologi-
cal (e.g., on plane growth), economic (e.g., on industrial prof-
itability), social (e.g., on regional employment) or a combina-
tion of these. Second, it may assist in evaluating sensitivities,
vulnerabilities or thresholds to likely scenarios of climate change
and in evaluating potential environmental standards. Third, it
can identify and/or evaluate the range of possible options for
adapting to and, where possible, exploiting the effects of clirnate
change. Fourth, it can help with the assessment of the costs of
impacts of climate change so that these can then be compared
with the costs associated with adaptation and mitigation mea-
sures in order to assist with the formulacon of balanced policy
responses. Fifth, it can identify impacts of limitation or adapta-
tion options, Sixth, it can assist in pinpointing gaps in clirnate
research that require attention because of their importance in

 

assessing impacts. Finally, it can alert public awareness to issues
of common concem (for example, to educate people about the
need for improving the efficiency of resource use) and establish
a basis for political decisions.

The interaction approach recognizes that climate is only one of
a set of factors that influence or are influenced by the exposure
unit (Figure 2). For instance, the effects of an equivalenc short-
fall of rainfall may be felt quite differently in difference parts of
the world, some experiencing hunger or malnurrition due to
underlying factors such as poverty, war or social marginalization,
others profiting from increased food prices at a time of general

A major shortcoming of most climate impact assessments to
date has been their lack of an in-depth treatment of adaptation,
due in part to its complexity and in part to the lack of a suitable
methodological framework. While it is represented in a simple
form in Figure 3, various aspects of adaptation are implied,
including adjustments that are endogenous to a system, and thus
cannot be separated from the assessment of impacts, as well as
exogenous adaptation, which is imposed externally on a system.

A general framework for conducting a climate impact assessment is
shown in Figure 4. It consists of seven main steps of analysis. The
first five steps can be regarded as common to most assessments.
Steps 6 and 7 are included in fewer studies. The steps are consecu-
uve (open arrows in Figure 4), but che framework also allows for
the redefinition and repetition of some steps (chin bold arrows). At
each step, a range of study methods is available. These are
described and evaluated in the following sections. For reasons of

In the physical sciences, a standard method of testing hypotheses
or of evaluating processes of cause and effect is through direct
experimentation. In the context of climate impact assessment,
however, experimentation has only a limited application.
Clearly it is not possible physically to simulate large-scale sys-
tems such as the global climate, nor is it feasible to conduct con-
trolled experiments to observe interactions involving climate
and human-related activities. Only where the scale of impact is
manageable, the exposure unit measurable, and the environment

One of the major goals of climate impact assessment, especially
concerning aspects of future climatic change, is the prediction of
future impacts. A growing number of model projections have
become available on how global climate may change in the
future as a result of increases in GHG concentrations (e.g., see
IPCC, 1990a; 1992a). These results, along with scientific and
public concerns about their possible implications, have mobi-
lized policy makers to dernand qualitative assessments of the
likely impacts within the time horizons and regional constraints
of their jurisdiction.

At the start of any climate impact assessment, researchers are
commonly confronted with an important choice with regard to
impact models—either to adopt existing models or to develop
new models. Bearing in mind that most assessments have severe
time and resource constraints, the most sensible strategy for
model selection is first, to conduct a rigorous survey of existing
models that are applicable to the issue being investigated. This
exercise is best conducted by experienced modellers, but some
information for non-specialists can also be provided by interna-
tional organizations, who can advise on suitable models or even
supply them directly. Examples of these can be found in the fol-

lowing sections.

Up to now most attention in this area has been on observing
the behaviour of plant species under controlled conditions of
climate and atmospheric composition (e.g., see Strain and Cure,
1985; van de Geijn et al., 1993). In the field such experiments
have mainly comprised gas enrichment studies, employing gas
releases in the open air, or in open or closed chambers including
greenhouses. The former experiments are more realistic, but are
less amenable to contro]. The chamber experiments allow for
climatic as well as gas control, but the chambers may introduce a
new set of limiting conditions which would not occur in reality.
The greatest level of control is achievable in the laboratory,
where processes can be studied in more detail and can employ

more sophisticated analyses.

The primary gases studied have been carbon dioxide, sulphur
dioxide and ozone, all of which are expected to play an interac-
tive role with climate in future plant growth and productivity.
Both temperature and water relations have also been regulated, to
simulate possible future climatic conditions. To date, there have
been experiments with agricultural plants (both annual and peren-
nial crops), crop pests and diseases (often in conjunction with host
plants), trees (usually saplings, but also some mature species), and
natural vegetation species and communities (where aspects of
competition can be studied). Controlled experiments have also
been reported on freshwater ecosystems (to study effects on water
quality and the food chain) and soils (examining decomposition

rates, nutrient leaching and microbial activity).

Biophysical models are e used to evaluate the physical interactions
between climate and an exposure unit. There are two main
types: empirical-statistical models and process-based models.
The use of these in evaluating futurc impacts is probably best
documented for the agricultural sector (e.g., see WMO, 1985),
the hydrological aspects of water resources (c.g,, WMO, 1988)

Empirical-statistical models axe based on the statistical relation-

simple indices of suitability or potential (c.g., identifying the
temperature thresholds defining the ice-free period on impor-
tant shipping routes), through univariate regression models used
for prediction (e.g., using air temperature to predict energy
demand) to complex multivariate models, which attempt to
provide a statistical explanation of observed phenomena by
accounting for the most important factors (e.g., predicting crop
yields on the basis of temperature, rainfall, sowing date and fer-

Empirical-statistical models are usually developed on the
basis of present-day climatic variations. Thus, one of their major
weaknesses in considering future climate change is their limited
ability to predict effects of climatic events that lie outside the
range of present-day variability. They may also be criticized for
being based on statistical relationships between factors rather
than on an understanding of the important causal mechanisms.
However, where models are founded on a good knowledge of
the determining proccsses and where there are good grounds for
extrapolation, they can still be useful predictive tools in climate
impact assessment. Empirical-statistical models are often simple
to apply, and less demanding of input data than process-based

models (see below).

Process-based models make use of established physical laws and
theories to express the interactions between climate and an expo-
sure unit. In this sense, they attempt to represent processes that
can be applied universally to similar systems in different circum -
stances. For example, there are well-established methods of mod-
elling leaf photosynthesis which are applicable to a range of
plants and environments. Usually some kind of model calibration
is required to account for features of the local environment that
are not modelled explicitly, and this is generally based on empiri-
cal data. Nevertheless, there are often firmer grounds for con-
ducting predictive studies with these process-based models than
with empirical-statistical models. The major problem with most
process-based models is that they generally have demanding
requirements for input data, both for model testing and for simu-
lating future impacts. This tends to restrict the use of such mod-
els to only a few points in geographical space where the relevant
data are available. In addition, theoretically-based models are sel-

"Programming models have an objective function and con-

producer (e.g., profit maximizing or cost minimizing). If the
objective function and constraints are linear, the model is
known as a Linear Programming (LP) model. If the objective
function is quadratic and the constraints linear, the model is a
Quadratic Programming (QP) model. If either the objective
function or the constraints are nonlinear, the resulting model is
a Nonlinear Programming model. However, LP models can
also incorporate nonlinear relations (for example, technical
relations) in a piecewise manner. Programming models can also
be of the partial equilibrium type, i.e., they determine produc-
tion (supply) and demand simultaneously. They are usually cali-
brated to a set of data in a given year. In this sense they are
empirically based. Programming models can be static or
dynamic. An example of the application of LP models to assess-
ing impacts of climate change is the study by Adams et al.

During the past twenty years, or so, there has been an enor-
mous proliferation of process-based models, which have devel-
oped to describe many different kinds of system. Many of these
have been applied in climate impact assessment, but the docu-
mentation of these models is often poor or difficult to obtain,
computer code may not be readily available, and the selection of
appropriate models for a particular problem or region can be very
difficult. Recently, efforts have been made to organize model
intercomparison cxcrcises, (e.g., for computation of evapotranspi-
ration; Smith, 1992), to coordinate the standardization of model
structure (e.g., within the International Benchmark Sites
Network for Agrotechnology Transfer, IBSNAT), and to make
generic or alternative models available to users in a single package
(c.g., CROPWAT, a computer program for irrigation planning
and management available from FAO along with a climate data
base of 3261 stations in 144 countries, FAO, 1992a; and the agri-
cultural decision support system for a range of crops supplied by
IBSNAT; IBSNAT, 1989).

do not state any decision rules. However, in the last decade a new
set of econometrically specified models has emerged: the so-called
dual models. These assume decision rules such as profit maximiz-
ing or cost minimizing of producers and utility maximizing or
expenditure minimizing of the consumer. In these cases, data fit-
ting is usually done by statistical methods (regression analysis) or a

Firm-level models depict a single firm or enterprise (i.c., a
decision unit for production). These are often programming
models but are rarely of the econometric type, due to con-
straints on available information about firms. Typical examples
include farm level simulation models, which attempt to mirror
the decision processes facing farmers who must choose between
different methods of production and allocate adequate resources
of cash, machines, buildings and labour to maximize returns
(e.g., Williams et al., 1988). Such models may also require data
on productivity, and it is this which constitutes the entry point
for potential linkages with the outputs from biophysical models.
Model outputs include farm-level estimates, for example, of
income, cash flow and resource costs for obtaining selected pro-
duction plans. These models are sometimes referred to as
microsimulation models.

Economic models are the only credible tools for deriving
meaningful estimates of likely effects of climate change on mea-
surable economic quantities such as income, GDP, employment
and savings. However, great care is required in interpreting the
results. Specifically, caution must be exercised in using any of

RE

the measures of cconomic activity as indicators of social wel-
farc. Potentially more serious, however, is the failure of most
models (exceptions include the models of Cline (1992) and
Fankhauser (1993)) to account for non-market effects of cli-
mate change. For example, many inputs to production are
directly affected by climate change (e.g., land and water) but
are not contained in most macroeconomic models. Economic
models are also widely used to consider the relative cost-effec-
tiveness of mitigation and adaptation options that are proposed
to ameliorate the adverse impacts of climate change, along with
associated economic, social and environmental impacts of these
options. Some of these points are further addressed below in
relation to integrated models.

"Input-output (IO) models are developed to study the interdc-

assumed to be constant, which is a weakness of the approach,
sirice re-organization. of production or feedback effects (such as
between demand and prices) may change the relationships
between activities. This is of particular concern when projecting
production activities beyond a few years into the future. More
recently, dynamic versions of IO models have been developed,
but these still lack many of the dynamic aspects of economic
behaviour. Nonetheless, the approach is relatively simple to
apply and the data inputs are not demanding. Moreover, thesc
models arc already in common usage as planning tools.
Examples of their application in climate impact assessment
include studies of possible impacts of climate change on the
cconomy of Saskatchewan (Williams et al., 1988—see Box 12
on page 37) and on economic activity in the states of Missouri,
Towa, Nebraska and Kansas (the MINK study) in the USA

"Economy-wide models, sometimes referred to as macrocco-
nomic models (which are actually a large subsct of this class),
link changes in one sector to changes in the broader economy,
dealing with all economic activities of a spatial entity like a
country, a region within a country or a group of countries.
Typical cconomy-wide models for climate impact assessment
include all types of general equilibrium (GE) models and 1O
models. Most GE models belong to the group of dual econo-
metric models, but there are also programming models among
them. The distinctive feature of GE models is that they deter-
mine endogenously (equilibrium) prices which clear the market
in the same way as partial equilibrium models. However, unlike
partial equilibrium models, GE models encompass all economic
activities of the region. The static form of the GE model is the
computable gencral equilibrium (CGE) model. Some of the
studies of climate impacts conducted to date with CGE models
have used as inputs the results of studies of sectoral impacts. For
cxample, the results of an agricultural impacts study by Adams ef
al. (1989), along with results from studies on coasts (related to
sea level rise) and clectricity demand, were used as inputs to a
general equilibrium model of the US economy to assess the
wider implications in all sectors of the economy (Scheraga et al.,
1993). There arc also dynamic GE models, which can treat the
evolution of an economy through time, ensuring at each time
step that the markets are in equilibrium. For example, a (recm-
sively) dynamic GE model of global food trade, the Basic
Linked System, has been used to study the potential effects of
climatic change on global food supply, using information on
potential yicld changes of major crops taken from crop mod-
elling studies conducted at 112 sites in 18 countries
(Rosenzweig and Parry, 1994).

The aggregate cost-benefit approach seeks to estimate the likely
monetary costs and benefits of GHG-induced climate change in
order to evaluate the possible policy options for mitigating or
adapting to climate change. This is a macroeconomic modelling
approach (see above), and has been applied to certain aspects of the
greenhouse problem for many years. In particular, the methods
have been used to compute the development paths for emissions
of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
(the driving force for climate change).

Historical event analogies use information from the past as an
analogue of possible future conditions, Data collection may be
guided by anomalous climatic events in the past record (e.g.,
drought or hot spells) or by the impacts themselves (e.g., periods
of severe soil erosion by wind). The assessment follows a ‘longi-
tudinal’ method (Riebsame, 1988), whereby indicators are com-
pared before, during and after the event. Examples of this
approach are found in Glantz (1988). However, the success of
this method depends on the analyst’s ability to separate climatic

The approach commonly combines a set of economic mod-

els with a climate model and a damage assessment model. The
economic models provide global projections (sometimes disag-
gregated into major regional groupings of countries) of likely
future paths of supply and demand in commodities that can
affect greenhouse gas emissions, on the basis of future world
population and economic development. The models use price
to determine the relative competitiveness of different technolo-
gies of energy production, while accounting for the long-term
depletion of fossil fuels, allowing for the development of more
efficient technologies and accommodating likely policies of
emissions abatement. The time horizon considered can range
from a few decades to several centuries.

Damage assessment models are functions that provide an
estimate of the likely impacts (costs) of climate change, usually as
a percentage of GNP. They commonly provide a global esti-
mate of ‘damage’ as a function of global mean temperature
change. To date, such functions have been selected subjectively,
on the basis of expert opinion or using the few quantitative esti-
mates that are available of the possible sectoral impacts of cli-
mate change at the global scale. Great caution must be exer-
cised, however, since simulation outcomes with these models
can be very sensitive to assumptions, such as those concerning
future discount rates and the estimated damage response. A fur-
ther major difficulty is the assignment of value to intangible
non-market ‘goods’ such as human well-being, a pollution-free
environment, and biological diversity.

‘The two types of approach outlined above originate from
quite different disciplinary perspectives and were developed for
contrasting reasons. However, it is becoming increasingly evi-
dent that major refinements of one approach will require signifi-
cant contributions from the other. Indced, it appears that the
two approaches are rapidly converging towards a common,
interdisciplinary method that will become a standard tool in pol-
icy analysis. Nevertheless, there are numerous problems associ-
ated with integrated system models, including their complexity,
lack of transparency and demanding data requirements for cali-
bration and testing. Further, modellers should take care to bal-
ance the sensitivity and uncertainties of model components, so
that the results do not merely reflect noise in the most sensitive
components of a model. Moreover, a major concern remains
about the ability of these models to represent the uncertainties
propagating through each level of the modelled system. This is
discussed further in Section 7.6.

Regional analogies of future climate work on the same principle
as analogies for present-day climate, except that here the analyst
attempts to identify regions having a climate today which is sim-
ilar to that projected for the study region in the future. In this
case, the analogue region cannot be expected to exhibit com-
plete similarity to the present siudy region, because many fea-
tures may themselves change as a result of climatic change (e.g.,
soils, land usc, vegetation). These characteristics would provide
indicators of how the landscape and human activities might
change in the study region in the future. Of course, for a full
assessment of this, it would be nccessary to consider the ability
of a system or population to adapt to change. This principle has
proved valuable in extending the range of applicability of some
impact models. For example, a model of grass growth in Iceland
has been tested for species currently found in northern Britain,
which is an analogue region for Iceland under a climate some
4°C warmer than n present (Bergthorsson et al., 1988).

In this way, an impression can be gained of the relative vul-
nerability of different exposure units to variations in climate at
different scales. This may then assist in selecting appropriate
exposure units for closcr examination, the geographical scale of
analysis, the time frame of the study and hence the projection
horizon for different sccnarios and the types of assessment tools
that are appropriate for conducting assessments (including mod-

Assuming that the general sector or sectors of interest have already
been identified, a useful first step in defining the specific exposure
units to be studied is to conduct a climatic vulnerability analysis
{e.g., Downing, 1992; Scott, 1993). This is a qualitative screening
procedure which classifies climate vulnerability in a matrix format.
Different exposure units within the scctor(s) are entered on one
axis, classified, for instance, by type or by scale. On the other axis
some cffects of climate are categorized, for example, by type of
climatic event, by possible future climate changes, or by a combi-
nation of these. Qualitative ratings arc then assigned to each cell
in the matrix, indicating both the likely size of the cffect and its
probability of occurrence. These estimates can be made using
whatever information there is available, i.c., from previous stud-
ies, expert opinion, literature review or simple quantitative assess-
ments (see below). An example is presented of a vulnerability rat~

is already pre-determined (e.g., focusing on an administrative
region or a physiographic feature such as a river catchment).
Even so, selection of an appropriate study region can pose some
problems. First, the region should be relevant to the exposure
unit. Second, it should provide adequate data, expertise and
conditions for carrying out the assessment. Third, within its

to climatic variations. Fourth, it should provide representative

results that can, if necessary, be extrapolated to a larger region.

One method of targeting appropriate areas for study is to use
simple, large area geographical zonation. This has been widely
used in assessing agricultural impacts, but is potentially applicable
in other sectors. It involves the calculation of simple bioclimatic
indices, which combine information on climate, soils and
topography into measures of suitability for crops, trees or natural
vegetation.-Some of the more sophisticated measures can indi-
cate plant biomass or even crop yield potential. Examples
include Képpen’s climatic classification (Képpen, 1931),

type of analysis (e.g., model-based, experimental, survey-based) or
where data requirements are uncertain, it can be instructive to
conduct a small scale pilot study under conditions representative
of those anticipated in the main study. These ‘microcosm’ case
studies allow different analysis tools to be selected, tested and eval-
uated, In addition, they can assist in identifying the personnel
required to carry out research. They also offer researchers some
experience in addressing problems they are likely to encounter in
the main project. For instance, in a project on regional tourism, a
representative tourist resort might be chosen as a pilot case study,
or for a study of coping strategies for drought in an agriculturally-
based, rural subsistence economy, a representative village might
be selected for a pilot survey and analysis.

Sensitivity analysis evaluates the effects on model performance
of altering the model’s structure, parameter values, or values of its
input variables. Extending these principles to climatic change
requires that the climatic input variables to a model be altered sys-

occur in a region. In this way, information can be obtained on:

Impact assessments are often hampered by the failure to
assemble appropriate data for a given task. This can be duc to
many causes, including a failure to locate where data arc held,
burcaucratic delays in the release of data, particularly across
national boundaries, and the high cost of obtaining some types
of information. This problem is particularly relevant in devel-

One problem often encountered i in applying process-based
models in less developed countries (LDCs) is that the models,
while extensively validated in the data-rich developed world, are
found to be ill-suited or poorly calibrated for use under the dif-
ferent conditions often experienced in LDCs. A lack or paucity
of data for validation may mean that a data-demanding model
cannot be used under these circumstances and that 2 model less

It is worth noting here that while predictive models offer
the most promising means of obtaining estimates of possible

yet sufficiently developed to be used for this purpose. Where
the systems are complex and/or poorly understood (e.g., marine

The testing of predictive models is, arguably, the most critical
stage of an impact assessment. Most studies rely almost exclu-

is crucial for the credibility of the research that model perfor-
mance is tested as rigorously as possible. Standard procedures
should be used to evaluate models, but these may need to be
modified to accommodate climate change. Two main proce-

to be widely applicable (see Section 4.2.1), and anyway should
be tested in a range of environments. There are fewer grounds,
however, for extrapolating the relationships in empirical-statisti-

condition for which they were devcloped. The use of regional
analogies of future climate is one possible method of addressing
certain aspects of this problem (see Section 4.3.4).

Where existing data are concemed, government offices often
hold valuable data for impact assessment, although the custodians
of such data may not be aware of its special relevance. In many
cases, data held by the central statistical office of a country is often
limited in its subject matter and regional coverage, and researchers
may need to access data archived in departmental or regional

"Monitoring is a valuable source of information for climate

sources (e.g., observed climatological data, remotcly-sensed

tral theme of research. In these, it is important to consider
aspects such as site selection, multiple-uses of single sites, design
of measurements and their analysis. It should be noted that there
are numerous national and international monitoring pro-
grammes, including one initiated by the IPCC (WG II). It is
important that results from such programmes be made available
to impact researchers for assessment studies.

Climatological data from the baseline period are used as
inputs for impact models. Some models produce estimates for
years or decades (e.g., crop growth models). These can generally
utilize the original climatological station data for years within
the baseline period. Other models run over long time periods of
multiple decades or centuries (e.g., soil erosion models). One
option here is to select a long baseline period, but lack of data
usually precludes this. An alternative is to use the baseline data
on. a repeating basis. For example, year 1 in a thirty year baseline
could be used as years 1, 31, 61 and 91 of a one hundred year
simulation. One problem with this method is that chance trends
or cycles in the baseline climate are then repeated in a manner

that may be unrealistic over the long term.

"In this section, aspects of the selection and construction of
scenarios for use in climate impact assessment are outlined. At the
outset, it is important to recognize that the environment, society,
and cconomy are not static. Environmental, societal, and eco-
nomic changes will continuc, even in the absence of climate
change. In order to estimate the environmental and socio-cco-
nomic effects of climate change, it is necessary to separate them
from unrelated, independent environmental and socio-economic
changes occurring in the study area. Thus, there is a need first to
develop baselines that describe current climatological, environ-
mental, and socio-economic conditions, It is then possible to pro-
ject environmental and socio-economic conditions over the study
period in the absence of climate change. Projections should take
into account, as far as is possible, autonomous adjustments (cf.
Section 8.2) which are likely to occur in response to changes in
these conditions (Frederick ef al., 1994). The resulting baseline
conditions are then compared, after impact projections, with
environmental and socio-economic conditions under climate
change. Thus development of baselines representing current and
projected conditions in the absence of climate change is a key and
fundamental step in assessment.

A popular climatological baseline is a 30-year ‘normal’
period as defined by the World Meteorological Organization
(WMO). The current standard WMO normal period is 1961-
1990. While it would be desirable to provide some consistency
between impact studies by recommending this as an appropriate
baseline period to select in future assessments, there are also dif-
ficulties in doing so. A number of points illustrate this. First,
this period coincides conveniently with the start of the projec-
‘tion period commonly employed in estimating future global
climate (for cxample, the IPCC projections begin at 1990;
IPCC, 1990a). On the other hand, most general circulation
models providing regional estimates of climate are initialized
using observational data sets taken from earlier periods. Second,
the availability of observed climatological data, particularly
computer-coded daily data, varies considerably from country to
country, thus influencing the practical sclection of a baseline
period. Third, it is often desirable to compare future impacts
with the current rather than some past condition. However,
while it can justifiably be assumed in some studies that present-
day human or natural systems subject to possible future climate
change are reasonably well adapted to the current climate, in
other assessments this is not a valid assumption (e.g., many eco-
logical systems have a lag in response of many decades or more
relative to climate). Finally, there is the problem that more
recent averaging periods (particularly those that include the
1980s), may already exhibit a significant global warming ‘sig-
nal’, although this signal is likely to vary considerably between
regions, being absent from some.

Of course, Jong time scale projection periods may be wholly
unrealistic for considering some impacts (e.g., in many economic

too short, then the cstimated changes in climate and their
impacts may not be easily detectable, making it difficult to evalu-

The time horizon selected depends primarily on the goals of the
assessment. However, there are obvious limits on the ability to
project into the future. Since they are a key element of climate
impact studies, climatic projections define one possible outer
limit on impact projections. Due to the large uncertainties asso-
ciated with such long-term projections and to constraints on
computational resources, most GCM simulations have been
conducted for periods of up to about 100 years into the future,
although a few have also been made over longer time periods of
several centuries. For this reason, the outer horizon commonly
adopted in impact studies has been 2100.

The environmental baseline refers to the present state of
non-climatic environmental factors that affect the exposure
unit. It can be defined in terms of fixed or variable quantities. A
fixed baseline is often used to describe the average state of an
environmental attribute at a particular point in time. Examples
include: mean atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide in a
given year, physiographic features, mean soil pH at a site, or
location of natural wetlands. A notable case is the mean sea
level, which is expected to change as a result of future climate
change. Furthermore, a fixed baseline is especially useful for
specifying the ‘control’ in ficld experiments (e.g., of CO, effects
on plant growth).

It is important to ensure that future climate, environment and
socio-economic projections are mutually consistent over space
and time. Many of these are in any case intimately related. For
instance, changes in greenhouse gas concentrations are related to
economic activity and resource use, which are themsclves a
function of increasing human population. A common area of
confusion concerns the relative timing of CO, increase and cli-
mate change. Thus, it should be noted that an equivalent 2 x
CO, atmosphere, in which the combined effect of CO, and
other greenhouse gases such as CH,, N,O and tropospheric O3
on the earth’s radiation balance is equivalent to the cffect of
doubling CO, alone, does not coincide in time with an atmo-
sphere in which CO, levels themselves have been doubled.
Moreover, there is a time lag of several decades in the climate
response to the radiative forcing (Box 2). Hereafter the terms ‘2
x CO,’ or ‘doubled-CO,’ imply a radiative forcing equivalent
to2xCO,

This issue is cspecially important in CO, enrichment experi-
ments, where the response of a plant is compared for ambient
and assumed future CO, concentrations. The standard conven-
tion is to consider a doubling of co, relative to ambient, but
the ambient level is rising, and experiments conducted in the
mid-1970s, when the ambient level was near 330 ppm (versus
660 ppm) are not comparable with experiments conducted in
the mid-1990s (360 ppm versus 720 ppm). Furthermore, the
experimental treatments often combinc temperature changes
with elevated CO,. In this case, projections of regional temper-
ature change are needed that are contemporaneous with the
CO, level being used. For this, reference must be made first, to
global assessments (see Box 2), and then to regional climate
change scenarios (cf. Section 6.5.3 and Box A2, Appendix). It is
also important to note that enriéhment experiments require
treatments that are sufficiently different from each other to
induce measurable differences in response. Thus, for example,
while a feasible and consistent scenario could be developed for
the year 2020, where CO, increases by about 50 ppm relative to
ambient and regional temperature increases by 0.5°C, this level
of change may not produce statistically significant responses in
enrichment experiments.

without climate change over the period of analysis is the fore-

The development of a baseline describing conditions without
climate change is crucial, for it is his baseline against which all
projected impacts are measured. It is highly probable chat fucure
changes in other environmental factors will occur, even in the
absence of climate change, which may be of importance for an
exposure unit. Examples include deforestation, changes in graz-
ing pressure, changes in groundwater level and changes in air,
water and soil pollution. Official projections may exist to
describe trends in some of these (e.g., groundwater level), but
for others it may be necessary to use expert judgement. Most
factors are related to, and projections should be consistent with
trends in socio-economic factors (see Section 6.4, below).
Greenhouse gas concentrations may also change, but those
would usually be linked to climate (which is assumed

ICC mode] (see Box 3) of the ‘best estimate’ of global mean
annual temperature change under the IS92a emissions sce-
nario produced for the IPCC (IPCC, 1992a), assuming no
negative forcing due to sulphate aerosols. It illustrates three
important points that are a frequent source of confusion and
misunderstanding among impact analysts:

(1) The projected doubling dates for atmospheric CO, occur
at differenc times depending on the selection of a baseline.
Climatologists often refer to pre-industrial CO, levels (shown
in the figure as a concentration of 279 ppmv in the year 1765)
as a baseline to examine effects on climate of subsequent
CO,-torcing. In contrast, impact assessors are more likely to
favour selecting a baseline from recent years (e.g., 1990, con-
centration 355 ppmv), to provide compatibility with other
baseline environmental or socio-economic conditions of
importance in impact assessment.

(2) The projected doubling dates for CO, alone occur sig-
nificantly ‘ater than the doubling dates for equivalent atmo-
spheric CO,, where all greenhouse gases are considered.
Hence, the doubling date for 1765 CO, (2060; 558 ppmyv)
occurs 30 years later than the equivalent doubling date
(2030). Similarly doubling of 1990 CO, to 710 ppmv is
projected at 2096, whereas equivalent doubling occurs at
2056.

(3) The actual or ‘realised’ warming at a given time in
response to GHG-forcing (as depicted in transient-response
GCM simulations) is less than the full equilibrium response
{as estimated by 2 x CO, GCM simulations), owing to the
lag effect of the oceans, These effects can be simulated at a
global scale by MAGICC (curves in figure). Thus, at the
time of equivalent doubling of 1765 CO, (2030), the equi-
librium warming relative to 1765 is 2.5°C (point A in fig-
ure), whilst the realized warming is only 1.8°C (point B).

ozone depletion. The emissions are converted to atmospheric
concentrations by gas models, and the concentrations are
converted into radiative forcing potential for each gas. The
net radiative forcing is then computed and input into a simple
upwelling-diffusion energy-balance climate model. This pro-
duces global estimates of mean annual temperature and fur-
ther ice melt and thermal expansion models are used to com-
pute sea level change. The estimates are time-dependent with
a time horizon up to 2100. Sub-models of MAGICC have
been widely used by the IPCC, and the system is continually
being updated to reflect improved scientific knowledge.
However, it should be noted that an important weakness of
MAGICC is its inability to account for regionally-specific
processes such as stratospheric ozone depletion and sulphate
forcing, which are highly dependent on complex atmospheric
chemistry.

under the GISS scenario, despite an 18 per cent increase in
water resources, the 5 per cent loss of land and 13 per cent
reduction in agricultural water productivity leads to a 6 per
cent reduction in economic welfare. The results also demon-
strate how individual sectoral assessments may give a mislead-

Nevertheless, there may be value in idencifying weather
anomalies from the historical record that can have significant
short-term impacts (such as droughts, floods and cold spells). A
change in future climate could mean a change in the frequency of
such events. For example, several studies have used the dry 1930s
period in central North America as an analogue of possible future
conditions (Warrick, 1984; Williams er al., 1988; Rosenberg,
1993). Another important anomaly in many regions is the E]
Nitto phenomenon. Changes in the frequency of this event could
have significant impacts in many sectors. An extension of this idea
is to select ‘planning scenarios’ (Parry and Carter, 1988), repre-
senting not the most extreme events, but events having a sufB-
cient impact and frequency to be of concem (for example, a !-in-
10 year drought event) or consecutive events, whose combined

effect may be greater than the sum of individual anomalies.

Temporal analogues are of two types: palaeoclimatic analogues
based on information from the geological record, and instrumen-
tally-based analogues selected from the historical observational
record, usually within che past century. Both have been used to
identify periods when che global (or hemispheric) temperatures
have been warmer than they are today. Other features of the cli-
mate during these warm periods (e.g., precipitation, air pressure,
windspeed), if available, are then combined with che temperature
pattern co define the scenario climate. Palaeoclimatic analogues are
based on reconstructions of past chmate from fossil evidence such
as plant or animal remains and sedimentary deposits. Three periods
have received particular attention: the Mid-Holocene (5-6000
years Before Present), the Last (Eemian) [nterglacial (125,000 BP)
and the Pliocene (3-4 million BP) (e.g., see Budyko, 1989).
Instrumentally-based analogues identify past periods of observed
global-scale warmth as an analogue of a GHG-induced wanner
world. Maps are constructed of the differences in regional temper-
ature (and other variables) during these periods relative either to
long term averages, or to similarly identified cold periods (e.g., see
Lough er al., 1983). The main problem with both these types of
analogue concerns the physical mechanisms and boundary condi-
ons giving rise to the warmer climate. Aspects of these were
almost certainly different in the past from those involved in green-
house gas induced warming.

A measure that is widely used in the intercomparison of var-

as the global mean equilibrium surface air temperature change
that occurs in response to an cquivalent doubling of the atmo-
spheric CO, concentration. Valucs of the parameter obtained
from climate model simulations generally fall in the range
1.5-4.5°C (IPCC, 1992a). Knowledge of the climate sensitivity

"Equilibrium-response experiments: the majority of experiments
have been conducted to evaluate the equilibrium response of
the global climate to an abrupt increase (commonly, a doubling)
of atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide. Clearly, such a
step change in atmospheric composition is unrealistic, as
increases in GHG concentrations (including CO,) are occurring
continuously, and are unlikely to stabilize in the foreseeable
future. Moreover, since different parts of the global climate sys-

start’ problem (Hasselmann ef al., 1993). This refers to the
assumption that the climate is in equilibrium at the start of a

has been a considerable build-up of GHGs since pre-industrial
times, and the recent climate is certainly not in equilibrium.
Thus, for the first few decades of a simulation, global warming is
strongly inhibited by the inertia of the ocean-atmosphere sys-

Transient-response experiments. Recent work has focused on
fashioning more realistic experiments with GCMs, specifically,
simulations of the transient-response of climate to GHG-induced
forcing. The early simulations of this kind considered the transient
response of climate to an instantaneous equivalent doubling of
CO,—s0-called ‘switch-on’ experiments. More recently, simula~
tions have been made of the climate response to a time-dependent
increase in greenhouse gases (IPCC, 1990a; 1992a). Transient
simulations offer several advantages over equilibrium-response
expenments. First, in the recent experiments, the specifications of
the atmospheric perturbation are more realistic, involving a con-
tinuous, time dependent, change in GHG concentrations. Second,
the representation of the oceans is more realistic, more recent sim-
ulations coupling atmospheric models to dynamical ocean models,
Third, transient simulations provide information on the rate as
well as the magnitude of climate change, which is of considerable
value for impact studies. Fourth, the most recent transient simula-
tions have also discriminated between the climatic effects of
regional sulphate aerosol loading (a negative forcing) and global
GHG forcing (Taylor and Penner, 1994).

Socio-economic factors that influence the exposure unit may
themselves be sensitive to climate change, so the effects of climate
should be included in projections of those. In some cases this may
not be feasible (e.g., it is not known how climate change might
affect population growth) and trends estimated in the absence of
climate change would probably suffice (see Section 6.4). In other
cases, projections can be adjusted to accommodate possible effects
of climate (for example, there are quantifiable effects on human
health of the interaction between local climate and atmospheric
pollution and toxic waste disposal in many urban areas, the causes
of which are closely associated with emissions and bi-products of

Sea level rise is one of the major impacts projected under
global warming. Global factors such as the rate of warming, expan-
sion of sea water, and melting of ice sheets and glaciers all con~
tribute to this effect (see Box 3). However, local conditions such as
coastal land subsidence or isostatic uplift should also be taken into
account in considering the extent of sea level changes and their
regional impacts, In most assessrnents, the vulnerability of a study
region to the effects of sea level rise will be apparent (e.g., in low
lying coastal zones; see Box 6). Less obvious are some inland loca~
tions which may also be affected (for example, through sea water
incursion into groundwater). The magnitude of future sea level
rise is still under discussion, but the estimates given in Box 3

Cost-benefit analysis is often employed to assess the most
efficienc allocation of resources (see Box 10). This is achieved
through the balancing or optimization of various costs and ben-
efits anticipated in undertaking a new project or implementing a
new policy, accounting for the reallocation of resources likely to
be brought about by external influences such as climate change.
The approach makes explicit che expectation that a change in
resource allocation is likely co yield benefits as well as costs, a
useful counterpoint to many climate impact studies, where neg-
ative impacts have tended to receive the greatest a attention.

Whatever measures are employed to assess costs and benefits,
they should employ a common metric. Thus, for example, where
monetary values are ascribed, this should be calculated in terms of
net present value, i.e. the discounted sum of future costs and ben-
efits. The choice of discount rate used to calculate present value
will vary from nanon to nation depending on factors such as the
level of economic development, debt stock and social provision.
Moreover, the depreciation of capital assets with Gme, which also
varies from country to country, should be explicitly considered in

the calculations.

A potentially useful method of evaluating both the impacts of
climate change and the changes themselves is to focus on
regions, organisms or activities chat are intrinsically sensitive to
climate. For example, climate change might affect the alticude at
which certain temperature-limited vector-borne diseases are
found, and high altitude sites in Kenya, Rwanda, Costa Rica
and Argentina have been suggested as potential foci for moni-
toring both of the vectors themselves, and of the populations at
risk (Haines ct al., 1993). Similarly, changes in plant behaviour
may indicate thac certain critical thresholds of temperature
change have been approached or exceeded. For instance, an
increasing frequency of events where plants fail to ower may
suggest that the chilling (vernalization) requirements of the plant
have not been fulfilled. Another example is low-lying coastal
zones at risk from inundation due to rising sea Jevel, and the
vulnerable populations located in such regions.

Cost-benefit analysis has the specific objective of evaluat-
ing an anticipated decision or range of decision responses.
For example, in considering the costs and benefits of an
adaptation strategy, a cost-benefit analysis might seek co
evaluate a question facing a decision maker: ‘Do the bene-
fits of a given level of adaptation outweigh the costs of its
implementation?’ The benefits of this action are the
avoided damages (i.e., costs) of impacts of climate change
(evaluated, for instance, using models of the type described
in Section 4.2.2),

The problem can be illustrated in a simple diagram (sce
figure). In the upper graph, the degree of adaptation is
expressed as two lines: one representing the costs of adap-
tation and the other the benefits (avoided costs) accruing
from this action. Both lines show increases with increasing
levels of adaptation, but the growth in costs accelerates,
while the growth in benefits diminishes. Characteristically,
the costs of minimal adaptation are small while the bene-
fits are high (e.g., at point A), but as the level of adapta-
tion increases, so the additional or marginal costs increase,
while the marginal benefits decline. These are the slopes
of the two lines in the upper graph, plotted as straight
lines in the lower graph. Economic analysis generally con-
cludes that che optimal result is where the marginal cost
and marginal benefic of the change are equal (point B on
the graph). To the left of point B further action is benefi-
cial, because the additional (marginal) benefits secured
exceed the additional (marginal) costs. Further adaptation
beyond point B produces an unfavourable cost-benefit
ratio (e.g., at point C) and is therefore not justified.

turn, these damages may show up in terms of market values—
lost crops, forest damage etc., and in non-market values—

distinction between market and non-market values is immate-
rial: both contribute to human well-being, which is che ulti-
mate yardstick of cost-benefit assessments. In practice, both
cypes of value raise complex issues. Market values may not, for
example, represent the true value of resources to a given econ-
omy, ¢.g., in the presence of taxes or subsidies or if environ-
mental costs are neglected. In this case, they have to be
adjusted to secure their ‘shadow’ values which measure the cost
of the damage to society as a whole. Non-market values have
to be elicited by direct and indirect methods such as contingent
valuation, hedonic property and wage models, travel cost mea-
sures, etc. The resulting estimates should, like shadow market
values, reflect the underlying willingness of individuals to pay
for the commodity, asset or service that is at risk.

"Errors may arise from several sources, including measure-
ment error, paucity of data and inadequate parameterization or
assumptions. Unknowns include alternative scenarios, or the
omission of important explanatory variables. The maximum.
range of uncertainty is the product of the individual uncertain-
ties. The upper and lower bounds of these may be highly
improbable, so more useful alternatives are confidence limits
(e.g., 5 or 95 percentiles), which can be computed by studying
the probability of uncertainties propagating, using methods such
as Monte Carlo analysis (for energy and GHG emissions exam-
ples, see Edmonds ef al., 1986 and de Vries et al., 1994; for a
health impacts example, see Martens ef al., 1994; for an agricul-
tural example, see Brklacich and Smit, 1992). These percentiles
are often used as upper and lower estimates of an outcome, with
the mean or median outcome used as the ‘best’ or ‘central’ esti-
mate. The quantification of uncertainty arising from inadequate
parameterizations or assumptions is more problematic, however,
as probabilities cannot readily be assigned to different choices.

Yet the identification and evaluation of adaptation options is
an essential component of impact assessment. In this section, 2
basic distinction is drawn between system responses co climate
change that are automatic or built-in (cermed auconomous adjust-
ments), and responses that require deliberate policy decisions,
described as adaptation strategies. While there are some overlaps
between these two types of adaptation, they are allocated separate
steps in the assessment framework (Figure 4) in recognition of the
different treatment they usually receive in assessmenc studies.

Adaptation is concerned with responses to both the adverse

and positive effects of climate change. [t refers to any adjust-
ment, whether passive, reactive or anticipatory, that can respond
to anticipated or actual consequences associated with climate
change. Many policies of adaptation make good sense in any
case, since present-day climatic variabilicy (in the form of
extreme climatic events such as droughts and floods) already
causes significant damage in difference parts of the world.
Adaptation to these events can thus help to reduce damage in
the shore term, regardless of any longer-term changes in climate.

Routine adjustments refer to everyday, conscious responses to
variations in climate that are part of the routine operations of a
system. For exaruple, as the climate changes, the growing season
for crop plants would also change, and crop performance might
be improved by shifting the sowing date. In some crop growth
models the sowing date is decermined by climate (e.g., che scart
of the rainy season or the disappearance of snow cover), so it is
selected automatically to suit the conditions. Here, che model is
performing incernally an adjuscment that a farmer might do
instinctively or routinely.

Mitigation or ‘limitation’ attempts to deal with che causes of cli-
mate change. It achieves this through actions chat prevent or
retard the increase of atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) con-
centrations, by limiting current and future emissions from
sources of GHGs (e.g., fossil fuel combustion, intensive agricul-
ture) and enhancing potentia) sinks for GHGs (e.g., forests,
oceans). In recene years there has been a heavy focus on mitiga-
Gon as a major strategy for coping with the greenhouse prob-
Jem. However, it seems likely that realistic policies of mitigation
will be unable fully to prevent climate changes, and that alterma-

tive adaptive measures are needed.

Most ecological, economic or social systems will undergo some
vatural or spontaneous adjustments in the face of a changing cli-
mate. These ‘auconomous’ adjustments are likely co occur in
response both to gradual changes in average climate (which
themselves may be barely imperceptible relative to background
chmatic variability) as well as to more drastic shifts in chimate,
for example, those associated wich a change in dominant atmo-
spheric circulation patterns. What is much less certain, however,
is what forms chese adjustments will take and what costs they
will incur. Clearly, in order to obtain credible estimates of
impacts, there is a need to account for these autonomous adjust-
ments in the assessment process (Smit, 1993; Rosenberg, 1992).

Inbuilt adjustments, sometimes referred to as physiological adjust-
ments, are the unconscious or automatic reactions of an exposure
unit to a cbmatic perturbation. Some of these are easy to idenufy
(for example, the automatic response of a plant to drought condi-
tions is to reduce transpiration water loss by closing its stomata),
and can be accounted for in models that describe che syscem.
Others are more difficult co detect (for instance, the ability of
long-lived organisms such as trees to acclimate to a slowly chang-
ing climate). These may require the implementation of some con-
trolled experiments to determine the nature of the adjustment
mechanistns (for example, by transplanting tree species between
different climatic regimes to investigate the processes of acclima-
tion in a changed environment; see Beuker, 1994).

In moving towards a more interventionist type of adjust-
ment, however, the distinction between autonomous adjust-
mencs and adaptation starts to become blurred. For instance, it is
not always a straightforward task to separate out autonomous
tactical adjustments that are directly related to climate change
from adjustments that are made to changing extemal conditions,
which are themselves an adaptive response to climate change
(such as government assistance to farmers to cope with adverse
climatic conditions), The evaluation of these ‘exogenous’ adap-

In this section, types of adaptation are described and procedures
presented for identifying, classifying and evaluating available
options for decision making. For more information on adapta-
tion strategies, Chapter 6 of the 1990 IPCC Response Strategies
report (IPCC, 1991a) provides a good overview of the range of
issues and ideas that should be considered in developing a
coherent approach. Moreover, several countries (including
Australia, Canada, and the USA) are actively pursuing the
development of protocols for che assessment of adaptation to
climate change.

Virtually all forms of cost-benefit analysis follow the basic
decision rule that for any action, project, programme or strategy,
the benefits must exceed the costs, however they are measured.
Benefits are measured relative to a set of desired cargets or plan-
ning objectives, which reflect a notion of what needs to be
achieved. Those objectives can further be quantified by conven-
tional measures of relative worth, termed evaluation criceria
(e.g., income, employment, change in habicat acreage, popula-
dion at nsk, etc.). Constraints may also be part of an evaluation
framework, defining a set of bounds that are considered accept-
able (for example, a 100-year return period event or a minimum
habitat size for a species based on per capita water availability).

At present there are no generally accepted procedures for for-
mulating national and regional policies for adaptation to clirnate
change, one of the reasons being thac the assessment process
involves value judgements, which can be both subjective and
controversial. Nevertheless, formal evaluation procedures do exist
to address analogous problems as part of the planning process in
many developed countries. By drawing on the expenences gained
in formulating those planning guidelines, a broad framework for
the evaluation of adaptation strategies to cope with climate
change can be identified. As with the general framework for
assessing climate impacts, che framework for developing adapta-
tion strategies also comprises seven steps (Figure 6).

Tactical adjustments imply a level of response over and above
the adjustments that are made routinely in the face of climatic
vanability. Such adjustments might become necessary following
a sequence of anomalous climatic events, which indicate a shift
in the climate. For example, a run of years with below-average
rainfall in a semi-arid region may persuade farmers chat cultiva-
tion of a drought-resistant crop like sorghum is more reliable
than a drought-sensitive crop like maize, in spite of its lower
yield capacity than maize in favourable conditions. Adjustments
of this type require a behavioural change, but can still be accom-
modated internally within che system. There are numerous
examples of assessments that consider these small-scale, low cost
adjustments (e.g., the MINK study, see Box 13; and a study of
world food supply, Rosenzweig and Parry, 1994).

One general approach for identifying the exposure units at
risk from climate variabilicy is vulnerability assessment.
Vulnerability can be defined as the degree to which an exposure
unit is disrupted or adversely affected as a result of climatic
events. It follows that vulnerable systerns, activities or regions
are likely to be chose most in need of planned adaptation.

"The approach can be illustrated with reference to a ‘com-
mon methodology’ chat has been developed for the
national-scale assessment of coastal zone vulnerability to sea level
nse (IPCC 1991b, 1994; cf. Box 6). One of the main objectives
of the common methodology is to inform national decision
makers about the vulnerability of the coastal zone, the possible
problems a country may face due to a changing climate and sea
level and, if necessary, the types of assistance that are most
needed to overcome these problems. The identification of criti-
cal levels of vulnerability and critical levels of climate change is
likely to be importance in the detennination of what constitutes
‘dangerous’ levels of climace change (a term used in Article 2 of
the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change). A pro-
posed six step process of determination is outlined in Figure 7.

This step involves an assessment, folowing the methods our-
lined elsewhere in this report, of the possible impacts of clirnate
variabilicy or change on the exposure unit. Where climatic
events are expected that will cause damage, these need to be
specified in detail so that che most appropriate adaptation
options can be identified. Where beneficial climatic events are
anticipated, these should be examined, both in their own right
and because they may help to compensate for negative effects.
Details include the magnitude and regional excent of an event,
its frequency, duration, speed of onser and seasonality (i.e., tim-
ing during the year). In the case of long-term climate change,
impacts should be considered relative co those that would be
expected to occur in the absence of climatic change. Moreover,
since there is often great scientific uncertaincy attached to pro-
Jections, it may be useful to express possible changes in terms of
the probability of their occurrence and/or as changes in the
recurtence frequency of events observed in the historical clima-
tological record.

Ie i is worth noting that society in general, and each resource
use sector separately, already contends with contemporary chi-
matic variability and the wide range of natural hazards (e.g.,
floods, droughts, storm surges and hurricanes) and the variety of
opportunities (e.g., a benign period of weather, an unbroken
‘snow season’, a mild winter) this brings. As a first approxima-
tion, it is probably fair to assume chat most of the current mea-
sures employed in resource management to deal wich climatic
variability will be equally feasible, even if not comparatively
cost-effective, under a different climatic regime. Ic follows,
therefore, chat the adaptation measures which ought co be
selected now are those which are beneficial for reasons other
than climate change and, for the most part, can be justified by

The key aspect of this step of evaluation is that all the com-
ponent measures that comprise a strategy are compared against
the same set of objectives and criteria, so chat decision makers,
policy makers and the public can see che relative range of bene-
fics and costs for each strategy as well as the distribution of
impacts among the sectors and population (equity). Only then
can crade-offs among objectives and berween management mea-
sures be undertaken. A wide variecy of methods and models are

available for such multicriteria analyses (e.g., Goicoechea et al.,
1982, Chankong and Haimes, 1983).

step of the analysis, therefore, is the key evaluation step, where
each objective must be weighted according to assigned prefer-

different strategies in meeting these objectives. For instance, for
coastal responses to accelerated sea level rise, there could be a
‘pure’ retreat option, consisting exclusively of regulatory mea-

development often conflicts with environmental protection). This
step is a prelude co developing strategies which maximize the
level of achievement of some objectives while maintaining base-

scenario, specifically the decade 1931-1940 in the MINK

drier and warmer than average in the region, consistent in
sign with GCM projections. These conditions were assumed
to occur in the present and also in the year 2030, along with
an increase in CO, concentration of 100 ppm (to 450 ppm).
Four sets of conditions were investigated: (1) the current
baseline, which referred to the economic situation in the
early 1980s, with 1951-1980 as the climatological baseline;
(2) climate change imposed on the current baseline; (3) a
baseline description of the economic structure of the region
in the future without climate change (including population,
economic activity and personal income); and (4) imposition
of climate change on the future baseline (including feedbacks
between sectors, such as the projected extent of irrigated agri-

Method: a number of models were used to evaluate impacts of
climate on individual sectors. For agriculture a semi-empirical
process model (EPIC) was adopted that simulates crop biomass
and yield production, evapotranspiration and irrigation
requirements. For forests, a succession model (FORENA) that
simulates the annual development of individual trees within a
mixed species forest was used. This allows the effects of cli-
mate change on both forest growth and species composition
to be evaluated. Both EPIC and FORENA were modified to
account for the direct effects of CO, on photosynthesis and
water use. Several approaches were used to estimate regional
water resources: changes in evapotranspiration and irrigation
requirements were modelled using EPIC. Regional water
supply was estimated using empirical relationships between
present and past streamflows. Impacts on the energy sector
drew on the modelling and interpretations from the other
three sectors and on an analysis of how heating and air condi-
tioning requirements are affected by changing temperature.
Finally, the economy-wide effects of changes in productivity
of the above resource sectors were studied using IMPLAN, a
regional input-output model. IMPLAN describes the interac-
tion between 528 industries in the MINK region.

characteristics including harvest index, photosynthetic effi-

priate as a response to climate change in the region. Rather,
barring major public intervention, only reactive measures to
forest decline such as salvage cutting were judged likely.
Qualitative assessments were made of possible adjustments in
water use (e.g., water conservation, a shift of emphasis from
navigation to hydropower production, recreation and water
supply on the Missouri River) and in energy production and

"Policy options: although the MINK study did not seek to pro-
vide specific recommendations to policy makers for how to
cope with climate change in this region, one important con-
clusion was that the relevant policy issue at the regional scale
is not one of climate change abarement (which can only be
dealt with at national and international level), but rather one
of optimal adjustment to climate change. An important
assumption of the study was that markets play a major role in
inducing adjustments needed for adequate response to climate
change. However, some important elements are not com-
monly considered in economic terms (e.g., the quality of
aquatic habitats is projected to decline in the MINK region).
These should necessarily fall within the ambit of public pol-
icy. Moreover, the study also speculated on possible policy
shifts, which could have more far-reaching implications for
the MINK region (e.g., the removal of subsidies for irrigation
agriculture under sharply increased water scarcity or subsi-

fully felt by 2030, but in che long term they would be severe.
There is little potential for adaptation to the climate change
unless the production of wood for biomass fuel makes adapta-
tion economically justifiable. However, forestry is a very
small part of the MINK economy. (3) Impacts on water
resources would be major and severe. The quality and quan-
tity of surface waters would diminish, water-based recreation
would sufter losses and navigation would become uneco-
nomic on the Missouri. Rising costs of water extraction
would make agriculture less competitive for surface water and
groundwater supplies and would hasten the abandonment of
irrigation in the western portions of the region. (4) Only
about 20-25 per cent of the region’s current energy use
would be sensitive to a 1930s-type climate, and any impacts
of climate would be cased by adjustments within the energy
sector so that the effect on the regional economy would be
minor. (5) Unless the climate-induced decline in feedgrain
production falls entirely on animal producers in MINK
(which would lead to an overall loss to the regional economy
of 10 per cent), the regional economic impacts of the climate
change would be small. This is because agriculture, while
important relative to other regions of the US, is still only a
small (and diminishing) part of the MINK economy.

The guidelines have been arranged in a seven-step analytical
framework that aims to capture the major components of an
assessment study (cf. Figure 4). The framework is able to accom-
modate the wide range of methods followed in a large number of
previous assessments, as is demonstrated in some of the boxed
examples in this report. However, it should not be regarded as a
definitive approach to assessment. There are other assessments that
follow perfectly valid alternative analytical methods (for example,
studies where the main focus is on adaptation to climate change).
Nonetheless, while the logical order of analysis may be different
in these studies, most of the basic tools and methods that are actu-
ally applied are embraced in these Guidelines.

all their methods and models are exposed to such a review pro-
cess from appropriate experts. Indeed, many large projects orga-
nize their own review process, whereby specialists are asked to
provide formal reviews of results prior to final publication.

"National programmes. Under the auspices of the World Climate
Programme (WCP), many countries have now organized their
own national climate programmes. Within these programmes
most have made provision for climate impact studies, and have
set up committees for directing research and channelling fund-
ing through national scientific bodies and government depart-
ments. Examples of countries with national programmes
include: Australia, Canada, Finland, Hungary, Netherlands,
Japan, Switzerland, UK and USA.

@ Information from climate models used in scenario construc-
tion should be correctly interpreted and original sources
accurately cited.

@ The major assumptions of a study need to be outlined and
substantiated.

@ Impact models should be properly tested, fully documented
or cited, and accessible to other researchers so that results are
easily reproducible.

@ All results should be accompanied by estimates of their

"Collaboration between stakeholders. The involvement of other
stakeholders in the assessment process has many advantages but
also some drawbacks. Local knowledge and experience can be
very useful in conducting the study, mobilising resources, inter-
preting results and in gaining regional acceptance of the results
and recommendations. In addition, the monitoring of a project
by funding agencies can be helpful in focusing the goals of the
research. However, policy makers should beware of jeopardiz-
ing the integrity of the research by excessive participation,
whilst researchers should cnsure that their work meets the needs
of policy as much as possible.

"Collaboration between researchers, Climate impact assessment is
interdisciplinary, involving the collaboration of researchers who,
in many cases, may not have worked together before. The iden-
tification of researchers who understand the goals of the
research, and are willing to work together, often under tight
time constraints, can be a major undertaking in the planning and
execution of many assessment studies. The cffectiveness of col-
laboration may also be influenced by the working environment.
At one extreme, some international projects purposefully bring
together researchers to work at a single site. At the other
extreme, studies may be conducted with no direct contact
between researchers. A useful framework for interdisciplinary
and interjurisdictional collaboration at a regional scale is pro-
vided by Integrated Regional Impact Assessment (see Section
2.3.3, above). Studies have been aided considerably in recent
years by the establishment of international networks of
researchers, commion databases and newsletters.

‘The private sector is a key player in influencing climate policy,
both as a significant contributor to GHG emissions and as an
end-user of climate as a resource. Besides wiclding considerable
political and economic influence, some sectors, such as insur-
ance, arc greatly concerned about the possible impacts of climate
change and sea level rise on their activities. Moreover, in many
countries engineering consultant firms are key players in the
preparation of climate assessments, often as part of larger envir-
onmental impact assessments of proposed developments.

Ultimately, most policy makers are answerable to the public,
and public opinion plays an important role in determining pol-
icy. It is important, therefore, that the public is kept
well-informed about progress in research. Effective communica-
tion is thus vital, and it is brought about partly through educa-
tion but primarily via the mass media. While researchers have a
responsibility to communicate their work in a clear and concise
manner to the public, the media also bears a great responsibility
for accurate reporting of the research. Unfortunately, there has
been a tendency by some to report only the miost dramatic or
controversial aspects of climatic change and its impacts, rather
than to present a more balanced view. Researchers should be
wary of checking thoroughly any material which is to be com-
municated to the public in this way.
"	Text
"One of the major problems of communication between.
researchers and policy makcrs is the need to convcy the consid-
erable uncertainties attachcd to future estimates, while demon-
strating that there is a problem to be addressed. Moreover, the
recent upsurge of interest in environmental issucs has led to a
rapid increase in the demands on researchers to communicate
results directly to policy makers (e.g., through government hear-
ings). Since many of the goals of policy makers are short-term,
there may be advantages in presenting rescarch results in the
form of the types of impacts likely to be experienced in the early
stages of a more general climatic change. Such results could use-
fully be expressed, for example, in terms of the risk of certain
events occurring that are of immediate concern (e.g., drought or
coastal flooding). Nonetheless, there are still major issues that
should be addressed over a longer time perspective (for example,
potential impacts such as extinctions, that are irreversible, or
more tangible plarming questions such as construction of dams
or coastal defences).

One of the major problems faced in applying GCM projections
to regional impact assessments is the coarse spatial scale of the
estimates. ‘T'ypically, GCM data are available at a horizontal grid
point resolution of, at best, some 200 kilometers. Several meth-
ods have been adopted for developing regional GCM-based sce-

(1) The study area baseline is combined with the scenario
anomaly of the nearest centre of a grid box (e.g., Bultot et al.,
1988; Croley, 1990). This has the drawback that sites which are
in close mutual proximity but fall in different grid boxes, while
exhibiting very similar baseline climatic characteristics, may be

assigned a quite different scenario climate.

The procedure for constructing transient scenarios is somewhat
different. Firstly, the problem of drift in the control run (see
Section 6.5.3) makes the selection of an averaging period prob-
lematic. Some workers use the full control period for averaging,
others a period at the beginning, and still others a period in the
control run corresponding to the equivalent period in the per-
turbation run.

"Second, the requirements for scenario information from
transient model outputs are either for discrete or continuous
estimates. Discrete estimates provide values for time slices in the
future (for example, decadal averages of change relative to the
control). Continuous estimates refer to year-by-year values
throughout the projection period. A simple method of scenario
construction, developed for use in deliberations by IPCC
Working Group II (TSU, 1994) is described in Box A2.

Two methods are commonly used for computing the change in
climate between the modclled control and 2 x CO, conditions
for each grid box: by calculating the difference or ‘delta’ (ie., 2
x CO, minus control), or the ratio (ue., 2 x CO, divided by
control) between pairs of values. The former method is usually
preferred for considering temperature changes and the latter for
precipitation changes. Note that if ratios are applied to tempera-
tures, data should be converted from the relative Celsius scale to
the absolute Kelvin scale (0°C = 273.15K).

Tt is usually assumed that monthly adjustments made to climatic
variables can be applied equally to data at shorter, within-month
time steps. In the absence of information about the year-to-year
variability of climate, it is further assumed that this remains the
same under the scenario climate as during the baseline period.
Recently, methods have becn reported that make use of the daily
data that are available from a limited number of GCM simulations.
The statistical properties of these data can be used to generate
stochastic weather data sets suitable as inputs to impact models.

(3) Experiments are conducted with regional ‘fine mesh’ cli-
mate models, which use inputs from GCMs and are then run
(nested) at a higher spatial resolution (e.g., see the review by
McGregor et al., 1993). This is a physically-based method of
accounting for important local forcing factors such as surface
type and elevation, which GCMs are unable to resolve. A num-
ber of model runs have been conducted for regions in Europe
and North America (e.g., Giorgi ef al., 1992) and Australia (e.g.,
McGregor and Walsh, 1993), and at least one (agricultural)
impact study has been reported based on the outputs from a
nested model (Meams and Rosenzweig, 1993).

(4) Statistical relationships are established between observed
climate at local scale and at the scale of GCM grid boxes. These
relationships are used to estimate local adjustments to the baseline
climate from the GCM grid box values (e.g., Wilks, 1988; Karl et
al., 1990; Wigley et al., 1990). A variant of this approach relates
local climate to objective measures of historical circulation types
and then determines a scenario climate on the basis of the circu-
lation type computed from GCM predictions (e.g., Bardossy and
Plate, 1992), A weakness of both of these methods is that they
assume that the relationships between sub-grid scale and large-
scale climate will not change under GHG forcing.

Since GCM outputs are not generally of a sufficient resolution
or reliability to estimate regional climate even for the
present-day (i.e., via the control run), it is usual for baseline
observational data to be used to represent the present-day cli-
mate. These are then adjusted to represent the 2 x CO, climate,
either by adding the deltas or multiplying the ratios described
above (Box A1). The method implicitly assumes, therefore, that
any systematic errors in the control run arc also present in the
experiment. A further note of caution concems the application
of precipitation ratios derived from GCM outputs to baseline
precipitation in dry regions. If the GCM indicates that precipi-
tation increases due to a shift in circulation, this increase
expressed as a percentage has little effect when multiplied by the
low baseline value, producing an unrealistic scenario. In such
cases, the discretionary use of differences rather than ratios

might be appropriate.

A nunber of studies have combined the anomaly 6elds from sev-
eral scenarios (e.g., GCMs, historical) into one scenano using
either dynamical/empirical reasoning (e.g., Pearman, 1988;
Ackerman and Cropper, 1988; Robock et al., 1993) or averaging
(e.g., Sancer et al., 1990). Composite scenarios of this type are not
generally realistic at a global scale, as they are based on a range of
source scenarios, each having different assumptions and regional
parameterizations. However, they have become useful in impact
assessment both because they are relatively simple to apply and
because they can provide information on between-model uncer-
tainty of projections (Viner and Hulme, 1992).

"The GCM estimates for the control and equilibrium 2 x
CO2 simulations are shown in Figure (b) as annual values
of mean June temperature. Climate modellers usually pro-
vide model results ory for a period during which the
global mean annual temperature approximates equilibrium
(often a 10-year period). A similar period is also selected
from late in the control run, as ic often cakes several
decades for the modelled 1 x CO2 atmosphere to equilibri-
ate. The difference berween the mean equilibrium control
and mean equilibrium 2 x CO2 temperature is then com-
puted, and this is applied as an adjustment co each annual
baseline value of June temperature at site § (Figure (c)).

It has become common to use simple climate models rather than
GCMs to estimate the effects on future global temperatures of
alternative GHG emission scenarios (IPCC, 1990a, 1992a).
Their attractiveness as policy tools makes ic desirable to use these
scenarios in impact studies. However, since only global estimates
are provided they cannot be used directly in regional assess-
ments. A method of overcoming this problem makes use of
GCM information in conjunction with the global estimates,
whereby the GCM estimates of regional changes are scaled
according to the ratio between the GCM estimate of global
temperature change and chat provided in che simple scenario
(for example, for a doubling of CO,). An example of how this
technique can be used in developing transient scenarios is shown
in Box A2.

Many GCM simulations have been conducted in recent years,
and it is not easy to choose suitable examples for use in impact
assessments. In general, the more recent simulations are likely to
be more reliable as they are based on recent knowledge, and
they tend to be of a higher spatial resolution than earlier model
runs. The IPCC has undertaken a GCM intercomparison exer-
cise, which should provide useful information on model reliabil-
ity and uncertainties (EPRI, 1994). Ic is srongly recommended
chat recent reviews of GCMs be consulted before selection. The
National Center of Avnospheric Research, Boulder, Colorado,
USA has been acting as a clearing house for GCM data from
different modelling groups. In addition, the Model Evaluation
Consortium for Climate Assessment (MECCA) at Macquarie
University, New South Wales, Australia has developed a proto-
type compact disc, MECCA CD, which contains data from
GCMs and a protocol for their distnbution and use.

change derived from the GCMs does not reflect the likely pat-

only recently been completed (Taylor and Penner, 1994).

"MAGICC is described elsewhere in this report (Box 3). In
order to obtain time dependent regional scenarios from the
global mean temperature changes estimated by MAGICC,
information is required from transient runs with GCMs,
Results from three coupled ocean-atmosphere GCM experi-
ments have been used in this exercise: the UK Hadley Centre
model (UKTR; Murphy, 1994, Murphy and Mitchell, 1994),
the Max Planck Institute, Hamburg model (ECHAM1-A;
Cubasch et al., 1992) and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics
Laboratory, Princeton model (GFDL89; Manabe et al., 1991,
1992). Each model has been run over different time horizons
and with slightly different assumptions about GHG comcen-
trations.
"	Text
"All models are affected by the cold start problem (cf. Section
6.5.3), making it difficult to assign dates to the transient cli-
mate changes projected with these models. To overcome this,
the time development of mean annual global temperature
change was obtained using MAGICC, which starts with a
pre-industrial climate and accounts for the GHG and sulphate
aerosol forcing up to 1990. The model was run for the IS92a
emissions scenario (including sulphates) assuming the mid-
range climate sensitivity (2.5°C). The mean annual global
temperature change was computed for the years 2020 and
2050 as 0.53°C and 1.16°C, respectively. These values have
been used to identify the decades in three transient GCM
runs where the global mean annual temperature changes are
equivalent (see Table I). In addition to overcoming the cold
start problem, this method also harmonizes the different
radiative forcing scenarios used in each experiment.
