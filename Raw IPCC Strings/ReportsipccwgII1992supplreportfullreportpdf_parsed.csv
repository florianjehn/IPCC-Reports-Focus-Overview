"IPCC Working Group II, charged with the assessment of
the environmental and: socioeconomic impacts of climate
change, completed its. first report, the IPCC Impacts
Assessment, in August 1990. Based dn that report and the
corresponding reports from Working Groups J and TIT and
its Special Committee on the Participation of Developing
Countries, the IPCC last that year agreed on a set of
conclusions (Fourth Session, Sundsvall, Sweden, 27-31
August 1990) which were forwarded to the UN General
Assembly. Subsequently, an Intergovernmental Negotiating
Committee (INC) was established by the General Assembly
with the specific charge to negotiate a climate convention
to be ready for signature at the United Nations Conference
on Environment and Development (UNCED) at Rio de
Janeiro in June 1992. In March 1991, the IPCC agreed
that a supplement to its 1990 report be prepared to assist
the INC further in its task.

Development of the climatic and socioeconomic
scenarios involves several steps. First, the current and
projected climatic, socioeconomic and environmental
conditions expected to exist over the study period in the
absence of climate change should be established. Second,
scenarios of regional climate change over the study time
frame must also be developed. Third, biophysical and
environmental effects should be projected under the altered
climate. These projections should then be used, preferably
in integrated environment-economic models, to calculate
the socioeconomic effects under the altered climate.
Assessment of potential impacts of the sector(s) or area(s)
of interest involves estimating the differences in environ-
mental and socioeconomic conditions projected to occur

At present, international organisations such as UNEP,
WMO and IOC are implementing monitoring programs to
help identify ecological and socioeconomic consequences
of climate change. UNEP has an initial program for
_observing terrestrial ecosystems with observations extend-
ing on either side of the present boundaries of plant zones
for early detection of possible shifts of these boundaries.
WMO and IOC, among their many monitoring activities,
have designed a satellite observing system for climatic and
ocean parameters. Current planning of the Global Glimate
Observing System (GCOS) and the Global Ocean Observ-
ing System (GOOS) should consider the value of including
the monitoring of terrestrial and marine ecological impacts
of climate change. These can provide an early indication
of the integrated effect of climate change.

Projected climate changes are expected to result in an
accelerated reduction of tropical’ forest on the African
continent and an encroachment of the Sahel syndrome into
the savannas. These changes could worsen the already
precarious production systems in the affected regions of
Africa, further stressing the associated natural ecosystems
and component species. Degradation of wetlands and
shallow lakes (eg within savanna ecosystems in Africa and
within the Great Plains of North America) as a result of
projected decreases in rainfall or soil moisture could
adversely impact on resident animals and migratory
species.

The impact of sea-level rise depends on the total net
rise resulting from the relative vertical movements of the
land and of the sea. In areas undergoing natural eustatic
uplifting of the land due to tectonic plate movement,
glacial rebound, and vulcanism, there will be little relative
rise of sea-level. In land areas that are naturally falling, as
in the south-eastern USA, because of tectonic and compac-
tion forces, impacts of sea-level rise will be more import-
ant.

"A new study of the Bering Sea indicates that in areas
without natural land uplift, there could be important
impacts where there is a high density of marine organisms
dependent on certain types of onshore and near-shore
marine environments that may be affected by sea-level
change. Nevertheless, sea-level rise is of far less conse-
quence in northern areas than are other impacts of climate
change to northern ecosystems and to global carbon
cycling. These regions are very important in the global
carbon cycle and a small temperature rise may cause
significant increases in bioprodtictivity and in carbon flux
to the oceans.

The principal recommendations are:

Increased variability of floods and droughts will
require a re-examination of engineering design as-”
sumptions, operating rules, system optimisation, and
contingency planning for existing and planned water
management systems; .
More studies on hydrologic sensitivity and the vul-
nerability of water resource management need to be
focused in arid and semi-arid regions and small island
states;

A uniform approach to the analyses of hydrologic
sensitivity to climate change needs to be developed for
comparability of results.

Hydrology and water resources

Since the publication of the IPCC Impacts Assessment,
several studies on impacts of climate change on hydrology
and water resources have been-conducted. Unfortunately,
there is not yet adequate information on regions affected
by aridity and desertification; efforts should be made to
fill that gap. The new studies expanded on the geographic
scale of the original surveys and confirmed many previous
conclusions, but few new insights were offered on hydro-
logic sensitivities and vulnerability of existing water
resources management systems.

The principal conclusions suggested by the new studies
are:

* Significant progress has been made in hydrologic
sensitivity analyses in developed countries, yet large
gaps exist in the information base regarding the
implications of climate change for less developed
nations;

¢ Comparative sensitivity analyses that rely on existing
GCMs offer generic insights regarding the physical
hydrologic effects and water resources management
impacts, but the differences in the outputs of the
GCMs coupled with large differences in hydrologic
sensitivity analyses make it difficult to offer region-
specific impact assessments;

* Temporal streamflow characteristics in virtually all
regions exhibited greater variability and amplification

of extremes, with larger flood volumes and peak flows
as well as increased low flow episodes and a shift in
the turning of the seasonal runoff;

¢ The higher the degree of water control, regulation and
management of sectoral water demands, the smaller
the expected adverse effects of global warming.
Conversely, unregulated hydrologic systems are more
vulnerable to potential hydrologic alterations.

that mid-latitude plants seem to tolerate salinity better and
are more productive under elevated CO,.

New findings of WMO/UNEP indicate that UV-B
radiation reaching oceanic and coastal zone environments
will increase faster than expected when the first IPCC
Impacts Assessment was written. Since so many marine
resources spend all or substantial parts of their lives’ near
the water surface, there is a significant threat to some
fisheries. The first assessment expressed concern about
leaching of contaminants during sea-level rise from coastal
waste disposal sites. There are also bacteria and viral
agents in such sites and in coastal septic sewerage systems
which could be increasingly released into coastal waters.
There are potential impacts on coastal resources, but the
primary concern is for the humans who consume them and
the loss of commerce owing to the closure of fish and
Shellfish areasby health authorities. Lastly, potential
changes in storm frequency or intensity could have import-
ant ecological consequences to coastal resources.

changes in climate associated with enhanced atmospheric
concentrations of greenhouse gases are expected to reduce

agreed on the importance of developing guidelines for
assessing the impacts of climate change. This report is a
preliminary statement on approaches to climate impact
assessment, with particular emphasis on assessing the
possible impacts of future change in climate due to the
enhanced greenhouse effect. There is little experience with
evaluating the social and economic impacts of climate
change, so the report deals with these only cursorily. It is
desirable that future versions address these topics in more
detail. The report does not aim to prescribe a single pre-
ferred method, but provides an analytical outline that
comprises a number of steps. A range of methods is identi-
fied at’ each step. Where possible, the merits and draw-
backs of different methods are briefly discussed, with some

"2.3 Study area

The selection of a study area is guided by the goals of the
study and -by the constraints on available data. Some
options are reasonably well defined, including government-
al units, geographical units, ecological zones, and climatic
zones, Other options requiring more subjective selection
criteria include sensitive regions and representative units.
Sensitive regions (eg tree line, coastal zones, ecological
niche, marginal community) .are selected because of their
inherent sensitivity to external forcing such as climate
change, and are where changes in climate are likely to be
felt first and with the greatest effect. Representative units
may be chosen according to any of the above criteria, but
in addition are selected to be representative of that regional
type and thus amenable to generalisation. For instance, a
single river catchment may serve as a useful integrating
unit for considering impacts of climate on water resources,
agriculture, forestry, recreation, natural vegetation, soil
erosion and hydro-electric power generation. Information
from this type of study may then be applicable to other
similar catchments in a region.

2.4 Time frame

The selection of a time horizon for study is also influenced
by the goals of the assessment. For example, in studies of
industrial impacts the planning horizons may be 5-10
years, investigations of tree growth may require a 100-year
perspective, while considerations of nuclear waste disposal

judged also likely to be similar. If these conditions are
fulfilled, then it may be possible to conduct assessments
whereby a target case is compared with a control case, the
target area experiencing abnormal weather but the control

"In the physical sciences, a standard method of testing
‘hypotheses or of evaluating processes of cause and effect
is through direct experimentation. An example is the
behaviour of plant species under controlled’ conditions of
climate and atmospheric composition. In the context of
climate impact assessment, however, experimentation has
only a limited application. Clearly it is not possible
physically to simulate large-scale systems such as the
global. climate, nor is it feasible to conduct controlled
experiments to observe interactions involving climate and
human-related activities. Only. where the scale of impact is
manageable, the exposure unit (ie anything exposed to a
given climate event) measurable, and the environment
controllable, can experiments be usefully conducted.
"	Text
"One of the major goals of climate impact. assessment,
especially concerning aspects of future climatic change, is
the prediction of future impacts. A growing number of
model projections has become available on how global
climate may change in the future as a result of increases in
greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations (eg see IPCC
1990a). A main focus of much recent work has been on
impact projections, using an array of mathematical models
to extrapolate into the future. In order to distinguish them
from ‘climate models’, which are used to project future
climate, the term ‘impact model’ has now received wide
currency, First-order effects of climate are usually assessed
using biophysical models, second- and higher-order effects
using a range of biophysical, economic and qualitative
models. Finally, attempts have also been made at compre-
hensive assessments using integrated systems models.

The use of expert judgment can also be formalised into a
quantitative assessment method by classifying and then
aggregating the responses of different experts to a range of
questions requiring evaluation. Probability judgments from
experts have been used to assess climatic change and its
possible impacts (NDU 1978, 1980), but there have been
problems of questionnaire design and delivery, selection of
representative samples of experts, and the analysis of
experts’ responses (Stewart and Glantz 1985).

"4.3 Model testing

The testing of predictive models is, arguably, the most
critical stage of an impact assessment. Most studies rely
almost exclusively on the use of models to estimate future
-impacts. Thus, it is crucial for the credibility of the
research that model performance is tested rigorously.
Standard procedures should be used to evaluate models,
but these may need to be modified to accommodate climate
change. Two main procedures are recommended: sensitivi-
ty analysis and validation. Sensitivity analysis evaluates the
effects on model performance of altering its structure,
parameter values, or values of its input variables. Extend-
ing these principles to climatic change requires that the
climatic input variables to a model be altered systematical-
ly to represent the range of climatic conditions likely to
occur in a region. Validation involves the comparison of
model predictions with real world observations to test
model performance. The validation procedures adopted
depend to some extent on the type of model being tested.
For example, the validity of a simple regression model of
the relationship between temperature and grass yield would
ideally be tested on data from additional years not used in
the regression. Here, the success of the model is judged by
its outputs, namely the ability to predict grass yield.
Conversely, a simulation model might estimate grass yield
based on basic growth processes, which are affected by
climate, including temperature. Here, the different internal
components of the model (such as plant development and
water use) as well as predicted final yield each need to be

compared with measurements.

"and economic change will continue, even in the absence of
climate change. In order to estimate accurately the environ-
mental and socioeconomic effects of climate change, it is
necessary to separate them from unrelated, independent,
environmental and socioeconomic changes occurring in the
study area. Thus, it is necessary first to develop baselines
that describe current climatological, environmental and
socioeconomic conditions. Then it is necessary to project
environmental and socioeconomic conditions over the study
period in the absence of climate change. ‘These baseline
conditions are then compared, after impact projections,
with environmental and socioeconomic conditions under
climate change. Thus, development of baselines accurately
representing current and projected conditions in the
absence of climate change is a key and fundamental step in
assessment. :

"assessments, there are also difficulties in doing so. Several
points illustrate this.

First, this period coincides conveniently with the start
of the projection period commonly employed in estimating
future global climate (for example, the IPCC projections
begin at 1990 (IPCC 1990a)}). On the other hand, most
GCMs providing regional estimates of climate are initial-
ised using observed climatologies taken from earlier
periods. Second, the availability of observed climatological
data, particularly computer-coded daily data, varies
considerably from country to country, thus influencing the
practical selection of a baseline period. Third, it is often
desirable to compare future impacts with the current rather
than some past condition. However, while it can be
justifiably assumed in some studies that present-day human
or natural systems subject to possible future climate change
are reasonably well adapted to the current climate, in other
assessments this will not be the case. Finally, there is the
problem that the more recent periods (particularly during
the 1980s) may already include a significant global warm-
ing ‘signal’, although this signal is likely to vary consider-
ably between regions and be absent from some.

Climatological data from the baseline period are used
to describe the present climate of the study region and
provide inputs for impact models. In the latter cuse,
several methods are used. Some models produce estimates _
for periods of a year or less (eg crop growth models).

Climatological data from the baseline period are used
to describe the present climate of the study region and
provide inputs for impact models. In the latter cuse,
several methods are used. Some models produce estimates _
for periods of a year or less (eg crop growth models).
These can generally use the original climatological station
data for years within the baseline period.

Other models run over long periods of decades or
centuries (eg soil erosion models), One option here is to
select a long baseline period, but lack of data usually
precludes this. An alternative is to use the baseline data on
a repeating basis. For example, year 1 in a 30-year
baseline could be used as years 1, 31, 61 and 91 of a 100-
year simulation, One problem with this method is that
chance trends or cycles in the baseline climate are then
repeated in a manner that may be unrealistic over the long
term.

To overcome some of the problems of data sparsity
and of long-term cycles, some modelling studies now
employ weather generators. These simulate daily weather
at a site randomly, based on the statistical features of the
observed climate. Once developed, they can produce time
series of climatological data having the same statistical
description as the baseline climate, but extending for as
long a period as is required (see Hutchinson 1987).

Of course, long time-scale projection periods may be
wholly unrealistic for considering some impacts (eg’ in
many economic assessments). On the other hand, if the
projection period is too short, then the estimated changes
in climate and their impacts may not be easily detectable,
making it difficult to evaluate policy responses.

The socioeconomic baseline describes the present state of

legislative (eg water use quotas, air quality standards),
economic (eg commodity prices, labour costs), social (eg
population, diet), or political (eg land set aside, land _
tenure). All of these are liable to change in the future, so
it is important that baseline conditions of the most relevant

"exposure unit. It can be defined-in terms of fixed or
variable quantities. A fixed baseline is often used to
describe the average state of an environmental: attribute at
a particular point in time. Examples include: mean atmos-
pheric concentration of carbon dioxide in a given year,
mean soi! pH at a site, or location of natural wetlands. A
notable case is the mean sea-level, which is expected to
rise as a result of future climate change. Furthermore, a
fixed baseline is also required for specifying the ‘control’
in field experiments (eg of CO, effects on plant growth).
A representation of variability in the baseline may be
required for considering the spatial and temporal fluctu-
ations of environmental factors and their interactions with
climate. For example, in studies of the effects of ozone

information both on the mean and on peak concentrations

In the context of future climatic warming, palaeo-
climatic scenarios for warm periods in the past have been
adopted in several climate impact assessment studies as
analogs of possible future climate. They have been used
extensively in Russia, where three periods have been
selected to represent progressively warmer conditions in
the northern hemisphere (Budyko 1989; IPCC 1990a): the
Mid-Holocene (5-6000 years Before Present), when
northern hemisphere temperatures are estimated to have
been about 1°C warmer than today, the Last (Eemiari)
Interglacial (125 000 BP) with temperatures about 2°C
warmer than today, and the Pliocene (3-4 million BP)
when temperatures were about 3-4°C warmer than today.

If the evidence upon which they are based is of good
quality, palaeoclimatic scenarios can provide a reasonable
representation of past climate, which is consistent in space
and time. Moreover, they have an advantage over instru-
mental scenarios in that the level of global warmth is much
greater than that experienced in the past century, and more
closely analogous to the magnitude of warming expected
‘during the next century.

atmospheric composition is unrealistic, as increases in
GHG concentrations (including CO,) are occurring contin-

relative to the control simulation are usually applied as
adjustments (expressed as differences or ratios) to the
observed baseline climate. Several techniques have been
used to apply transient response outputs to the baseline
climate (eg Croley 1990) and to provide data at a different
time resolution from those obtained from GCMs (eg Bultot
et al. 1988). One of the major problems faced in applying
GCM projections to regional impact assessments is the
coarse spatial scale of the estimates. Several methods have
been adopted for developing regional GCM-based scenarios
at sub-grid-scale, including assignment of the nearest grid
box estimate (eg Croley 1990), objective interpolation (eg
Parry and Carter 1988; Cohen 1991), statistical analysis of
local climatic fields (eg Wilks 1988) and merging of
several scenarios based on expert judgment (eg Pearman
1988) or averaging (eg Department of the Environment
1991).

There have been objections to the concept of using
GCMs for developing climate change scenarios for region-
al impact studies, owing to uncertainties that prevent
accurate regional-scale simulations. However, these
"	List
"ments may include:

* Geographical analysis of the impacts. Impacts vary
over space, and this pattern of variation is of concern
to policy makers operating at regional, national or
international scales, because these spatial differences
may have consequent policy and planning implications,
The geographical depiction of climate change, present-
ed as maps, is one method of describing impacts. Geo-
graphical information systems (GIS) may be used to
depict patterns of climate change, evaluate the regional
potential for different activities using simple indices,
map changes in. the pattern of potential induced by a
given climate change, identify regions. of particular

sensitivity to climate change, and display the impact of
climate on different activities within a given geo-
graphical region.

* Compliance to standards, which may provide a
reference or an objective against which to measure the
impacts of climate change. For example, the effect on
water quality could be gauged by reference to current
water quality standards.

¢ Qualitative description, which may be used to evaluate
the impacts of climate change. The success of this
method rests on the experience and interpretive skills

5.6 Projecting environmental trends with climate
change

Projections must be made for each of the environmental
variables or characteristics of interest in the study and
included in the description of environmental trends in the
absence of climate change. These projections are made
using the climate projections and the biophysical models
selected for the study (as described in Section 3.2.1).
Because all changes in environmental conditions not due to
climatic factors should already have been incorporated in
the development of the environmental trends in the absence
of climate change, the only changes in these trends to be
incorporated here are those due solely to climate change.
The two factors most commonly required in assessments
are GHG concentrations and sea-level rise. Future changes
in these are still under discussion, but ‘the estimates
' reported by the IPCC may serve as a useful basis for
constructing scenarios (IPCC 1990a). Other factors that are
directly affected by climate (such as river. flows, runoff,
erosion) would probably require full impact assessments
of their own, although some might be incorporated as
‘automatic adjustments’ in projections.

5.7 Projecting socioeconomic trends with climate
change

The changes in environmental conditions that are attribu-
table solely to climate change serve as inputs to the
economic modelling that projects the changes in socioeco-
nomic conditions due to climate change over the study
period. All other changes in socioeconomic conditions over
the period of analysis. are attributable to non-climatic
factors and should have been included in the estimation of
socioeconomic changes in the absence of climate change.

It is not known how climate change might affect some
important socioeconomic factors (eg population growth)
and trends estimated in the absence of climate change
would probably suffice. Other factors can be estimated,
however (eg winter electricity demand in relation to future
warming). Moreover, some human responses to climate
change are predictable enough to be factored-in to future

Climate change could affect steam and nuclear electric
power plants. They are vulnerable to curtailments of water
supply for cooling and are moderately sensitive to increas-
es in wet-bulb air temperature or water temperature,
depending on the type of cooling system. Anticipation of
climate extremes when designing plants can avoid many of
the problems, but water supply during extreme drought
depends on the overall water management situation in each
basin. An example of potential problems with both steam
electric and hydro-electric systems during drought was the
event in the summer of 1988 in the eastern US. Water
runoff shortages caused decreases in hydro-power and in
available steam electric power coincident with increased air
conditioning loads. However, the electric system was able
to handle the situation without curtailment of power.

"Developing countries tend to have different mixes of
energy technologies and are often at different stages of
development of their energy-using and supply systems than
developed countries. Since drought conditions tend to
diminish both hydro and traditional biomass sources
simultaneously, countries with a relatively high dependence
on those sources are more vulnerable. Africa, non-OECD
Asia and Latin America are particularly high in depend-
ence on biomass energy, ranging from as high as 100% ir
one country and above 90% in a number of African and
Asian countries. Latin America and non-OECD Asia also
are particularly high in dependence on hydro-power. Semi-
arid countries usually are most vulnerable to natural
fluctuations in precipitation, even without global climate
change. Tropical developing countries represent a poten-
tially large source of increased demand for electricity for
air-conditioning. Demand may grow both with improvec
economic conditions and with higher temperatures.

Various studies have highlighted the potential signifi-
cance of changes im the El Nifio/Southern Oscillation
phenomenon (ENSO) that might accompany global warm-
ing. It is estimated that the El Nifio of 1982-83 caused
losses of $US3 billion in the Southeast Pacific owing to
disruptions in agriculture, destruction of infrastructure, and
declines in fisheries production (Sotelo 1991). In Vietnam,
highly productive fisheries (at the edge of upwelling and
downwelling regions) have shifted during El Nitto events
and, as a result, overall production has ‘declined sharply
(Parry 1991). ENSO amplifies climate variability, imposes
a specific temporal pattern to drought and heavy rainfall
periods, and allows some predictability of these variations
in Southeast Asia. If this variability is enhanced under a
changed climate, then sustainable development could be
made much more difficult (Nicholls 1991). Changes in
atmospheric circulation that may occur under conditions of
global warming could alter, by changing the connections
between low and middle latitudes, the impacts of ENSO,
even if the phenomenon itself remains unchanged (Nicholls
1991). At this point, however, the direction and potential
magnitude of changes in ENSO under conditions of climate
change is uncertain, so it is impossible to make projections
of likely impacts of changes in ENSO.

Drought has a differential impact on farmers, depend-
i$ on their economic and social circumstances. In
Mexico, it has had a different impact on different segments
and sociopolitical types of farmers. Ninety per cent of
losses from natural hazards are from drought in Mexico;
Ejidos or communally held farms, however, have consis-
tently suffered more losses (to.a maximum of twice as
much in 1970) from drought than privately owned farms.
This is partly explainable by the “biophysical marginality’
of these Jands, but also by a lack of access to irrigation,
credit and other resources. Liverman (1991) goes on to

Exposure to UV-B is known to be associated with
increased skin cancers ranging from basal cell and squa-

More specifically, a recent New Zealand study
concludes that global warming could increase the possibili-
ty that many medically important pest species currently not
present in New Zealand could become established there.
One species, the dengue-bearing Aedes albopictus, has
recently arrived in Fiji, and is poised to enter New
Zealand. The islands of Tokelau are also at risk from the
pest, with sea-level rise potentially creating more brackish
water in which it could breed. Aedes aegypti, which also
carries dengue and dengue haemorrhagic fever, has only
been kept out of New Zealand by a few degrees of cold,
and warming could thus easily change this situation. The
mosquito that is most important medically in New Zealand
(Culex quinquefasciatus) could also expand its range with
increased temperature (New Zealand 1990).

5 Ultraviolet radiation and health

One supposition about impacts of UV-B on health that has
been confirmed is that UV-B induces immunosuppression
in humans. This was found to affect humans regardless of
pigmentation, and could lead to greater incidence or
severity of infectious diseases including (but not limited to)
the viruses involved in herpes, papilloma, and acquired
immunodeficiency disease. Previous speculation had been
that peoples with dark pigmentation might not be at risk,
but this new discovery indicates that all the world’s
population is at risk from UV-B induced immunosuppres-
sion (UNEP 1991).

Marine invertebrates differ greatly in their sensitivity
to UV-B radiation. Small crustacean and larval shrimp are
particularly sensitive to UV-B radiation. There is evidence
that a decrease in column ozone abundance could diminish
the near-surface season of invertebrate zooplankton
populations. For some zooplankton, the time spent at or
near the surface is critical for food gathering and breeding -
(Hader and Worrest 1991).

"A general response to drought, nutrient limitations and
high irradiance (visible and UV) is the accumulation of
flavonoids in epidermal tissues. These compounds absorb
strongly in the UV-A and UV-B spectra and their accumu-
lation in the epidermis has been shown to reduce epidermal
transmittance of UV. It has now been established that the
synthesis of several of the key enzymes in the flavonoid
biosynthetic pathway are induced by UV-B (Teramura and
Sullivan 199 1).

All the other model calculations lead to similar
tendencies of increase in urban oxidant formation with the
increase in air temperature (Dodge 1989; Penner et al.
1989). A decrease in column ozone of 20% would lead to
an OH increase of roughly 15% over continental areas
(Thompson et al. 1989; Liv and Trainer 1988). The
concentrations of HNO,, PAN and H,O, would be in-
creased for reduction in overhead ozone (Frank et al.

Recent measurements in Antarctic waters have indicat-
ed a reduction in photosynthesis rates of 6% to 12% for
total water column productivity at times and locations
when increased UV-B was experienced (Smith et al. 1992).
The photosynthetic pigments are affected and consequently
the production of energy and reduction equivalents decreas-
es, which in turn hampers CO, incorporation in organic
material (Hader and Worrest 1991). UV-B has been found
to have an effect as far down in the oceans as 37 metres
(UNEP 1991).

The RTM- mW model was run using an increased
temperature scenario (a uniform 4°C with an increase in
water vapour concentration assuming constant specific
humidity). Peak daily ozone concentrations in the warmer
model increased by 3% to 20% (mean increase of 9%). In
the midwestern and southeastern United States, the changes
in ozone ranged from -2.4% to 8.0%, with a mean value
of 3.4% (Morris et al. 1989). The model suggests that
approximately three times as many people in central
Califomia and 60% more people in the midwestern/
southeastern modelling domain would be exposed to ozone
concentrations in excess of US air quality standards as a
result of the 4°C increase.

The interaction between UV-B dose and microclimate

several growing seasons and an evaluation of the metabolic

"7.2 Determination of sensitivities

Given a 16% ozone decrease over temperate pelagic
waters, UV-B radiation levels at a depth of 1 meter would
reach a lethal (50% mortality) cumulative radiation dose in
fewer than 5 summer days for about half the zooplankton
species examined. Perhaps even more important, the
threshold levels of UV-B exposure would occur earlier in
the year than has been the case, a time when these species
are normally found near the surface (Damkaer et al. 1981;
Dey et al. 1988),

On the North American Pacific coastal shelf, anchovy
larvae are restricted to the upper 0.5 metres, and therefore
a 16% ozone reduction could lead to large increases in
larval mortality (Hunter et al, 1982). Experiments have
shown that larvae 2, 4, and 12 days old would have 50,
82, and 100% mortality (Hader and Worrest: 1991).

For the sensitive soybean cultivar, a 25% ozone
reduction reduced overall yield by 19-25% during four of
the six -years. In contrast, yield increased from 5 to 22%
in five of the six years for the UV-B resistant cultivar
(Teramura and Sullivan 1991). After three years of
supplemental irradiation of UV-B simulated those that
would be anticipated with stratospheric ozone reductions of
16% and 25%, plant biomass was reduced by 12% to 20%
at the highest simulated ozone depletion (Sullivan and
Teramura 1991).

"Since the publication of the first IPCC Impacts Assess-
ment, there has been a growing emphasis on the need for
‘moving’ pictures of how agriculture may respond to
transient climate changes over time. Research has begun to
grapple with how such transient projections of agricultural
technology should be estimated (Rosenberg and Crosson
1991). For example, conventional plant breeding and
biotechnology are each expected to improve yields on the
order of 1-2%/year (Pimentel et al. 1992) and such esti-
mates should be factored into projections of future impacts
of climate change. Other probable future changes in
agriculture include higher fossil fuel prices and greater use
of crops for fuel and paper fibre.

"While assumptions about climatic scenarios have not
changed for the purposes of the ongoing IPCC assessment,
it is important to note that improvements in methods for
generating climate change scenarios are under develop-
ment. One such method is the nesting of meso-scale
meteorological models within general circulation models
(GCMs) to improve regional climate change prediction
(Giorgi and Mearns 1991). Another method is the use of
stochastic weather generation models to generate synthetic
daily time series with changes in variance, as well as
means (Wilks 1991; Mearns et al. 1992). This is helpful
because most impact studies so far have been limited to the
investigation of the effects of mean changes in climate
variables.

Some studies have begun to investigate the effect of
potential changes in climate variance on the variability of
crop yields, a key factor of agricultural stability. The
question of agricultural sensitivity to climatic variability
has been researched by superimposing past variations on
altered average conditions to assess impacts for crop
yields, farm returns and risks, and regional production in
Ontario, Canada (Brklacich and Smit 1992), and the
American midwest (Easterling et al. 1991). The effects of
a range of temperature and precipitation variance changes,
as well as future changes in variance predicted by one
GCM, on simulated wheat yields in Kansas have been
analysed by Mearns et al. (1992). Further investigation of
climate and crop yield variabilities should be encouraged.

Another key point which is emerging is that the
emphasis of previous climate change studies on the
arbitrary doubling of atmospheric CO, levels (or their
equivalent) may be limiting estimation of impacts (Cline
1992). Atmospheric CO, concentration is projected to
increase beyond doubling to 1600 ppm by the year 2250
(Sundquist 1990) and GCM simulations have shown large
warming effects of CO, at such levels (Manabe and Bryan
1985). Greater warming beyond the equivalent doubled
CO, level has implications for projections of agricultural
impacts, because higher temperatures may lead to earlier
maturity and lower yields of determinate crops in
temperate regions, higher levels of potential evapo-
transpiration and water stress, and possible high tempera-
ture damage to yield quality (Wang and Hennessey 1991).
While the climatic effects of CO, may negatively affect
agricultural production at concentrations higher than
doubled, the beneficial direct effects of CO, on crop
growth may level off at higher CO, concentrations, as seen
in experimental work on leaf photosynthetic rates (Akita
and Moss 1973), leading to potentially greater negative
impacts later.

In the area of direct climatic effects on crop growth, recent
work shows that continued concern for future agricultural
production appears warranted, a confirmation of the IPCC
conclusions. Drought frequency may indeed increase in
low and: mid latitudes owing to increases in the demand of
the atmosphere for water (potential evapotranspiration)

higher frequency. of occurrence of dry spells (Pittock et al.

of temperature and precipitation overall is still uncertain
(Mearns et al. 1992),
Other critical types of newly identified climate effects
- are slight amounts of warming in the early stages of the
projected climate change or increases in variability. These
types of climate change may increase frost damage to
crops (demonstrated by simulating wheat growth in
Kansas), as slight warming or augmented variability
actually lessens winter hardiness while not eliminating hard
frosts altogether in some regions (Mearns et al. 1992).

"7 Effects of climate change on the distribution of
agricultural pests and diseases

Recent reviews echo the earlier IPCC conclusion that
ecological conditions for insect growth and abundance are
expected to improve overall through lengthening of
breeding seasons and extension of ranges (Porter et al.
1991; Pimentel et al. 1992), but also suggest that drier
conditions may decrease pest damage in some regions.
Porter et al. (1991) investigated the impact of one GCM
climate change scenario on the European corn borer
(Ostrinia nubilalis) in Europe, finding northward shifts in
potential distribution of up to 1220 km, and an additional
generation in nearly all regions where the insect is current-
ly known to oceur.

Pimentel et al. (1992) considered the effects of a 2°C
temperature rise in the US and Africa and found that, if
North America becomes warmer and drier, crop losses due
to plant diseases are expected to decline as much as 30%
below current levels. If Africa becomes warmer and
wetter, crop losses to diseases will increase up to 133%
above current levels for some crops. High percentages of
crop losses to pests are expected to be sustained in Africa
because effective pest control technologies are not exten-

’ sively in use, nor are they expected to improve appreciably
in the future. US crop losses to weeds are estimated to rise
between 5% and 50% (depending on the crop), because of
intensified competition from weeds, which are often better
adapted to arid conditions than are crops. Herbicidal
controls tend to be less effective under hot/dry conditions
than they are under the more cool/wet current conditions
(Pimentel et al. 1990).

An integrated research project on the US midwest
region (Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas) used the
1930s climate (1.1°C increase in temperature) as a warmer

model and its use for evaluation of both available and
induced adaptations; inclusion of technological change;
analysis of climate variability effects on crop yield varia-
bility; and integration of impacts on multiple sectors
including agriculture, forestry, water resources, and
energy. The research found that impacts on agriculture
overall would be small given adaptation (Rosenberg and
Crosson 1991; Easterling et al. 1991). Relating these
results to the IPCC best estimate of 2.5°C warming
implies agricultural losses of about 10% for equilibrium
warming of doubling of CO, equivalent (Cline 1992).
However, at the margins of the region losses could be
considerable with a shift in irrigation from west to east.
Effective adjustments to the 1930s climate change scenario
in the US midwest were earlier planting combined with
longer season varieties of annuals and shorter season
varieties in perennials, and the use of furrow dyking in
warm season crops. Wheat benefited from reduction of

cold stress and earlier break in dormancy.

will be translated into incomplete and imprecise
reactions by farmers, agricultural organisations. and
government agencies. Both economic and environ-
mental costs and benefits of proposed adaptations
should be evaluated.

A needed focus is a better understanding of the

linkages between climate impacts and socioeconomic

structures and the critical thresholds where significant
change takes place. Regions suffering from food
poverty today need to be evaluated for vulnerability to
the potential for increased stress from climate change.

Much can be done to study ways to enhance resilience

of agricultural activities to climate variability. Devel-

As these regional and national studies come forward,
they highlight the IPCC conclusion that impacts will vary
greatly according to types of climate change and types of
agriculture. Beneficial and detrimental effects of climatic
change will not be evenly distributed over the world. In
particular, it appears more certain now that cool and
temperate climatic zones may benefit, but in the tropics a
further increase in temperature will be undesirable.

Research continues to address the relative importance
of direct and indirect effects of CO, on future crop produc-
tion. Some scientists weigh the beneficial effects as the
dominant factor, while some are sceptical that the large
benefits seen in experimental settings will be seen in
farmers’ fields under changing climate conditions. Com-
bined studies of direct and indirect effects of CO, on crops
have been intensified to provide clarification. A key point
which is emerging is that the warming effects of CO, are
projected to increase beyond doubling point, but direct
physiological effects may level off. The future is also
projected to bring simultaneous multiple stresses, such as
elevated UV-B radiation and increased tropospheric ozone,
in combination with high CO,, and these may negate some
of the beneficial physiological effects in some crops.

Recent studies have reinforced the concern for in-
creased incidence of both droughts and floods, and on
water resources for agricultural in general. Changes in
water resource availability (both in timing and quantity)
pose the greatest risks to agriculture resulting from climate
change. Thus, water resource management for food and
fibre production (in relation to water needs for other
sectors as well) is a crucial task.

Current reviews confirm the earlier conclusion of the
IPCC that ecological conditions for insect growth and
abundance are expected to improve overall.

The human population must be seen as both a part of
the solution (ability to respond) and part of the problem
(population growth). Within this context, Forestry Canada,
as part of Canada’s ‘Green Plan’ (Anon 1991), has begun
a community tree-planting program designed to encourage
the planting of up to 325 million trees in urban and rural
areas across Canada. By the year 2000, this will result in
the absorption of some 5.2 million tonnes of CO,, thus
helping to offset future carbon emissions by including the
involvement of the public at Jarge in this issue. In addition
to Canada’s Green Plan, the US has the Global Releaf
Program of the American Forestry Association.

Progress since the IPCC Impacts Assessment in 1990
1 Socioeconomic importance of forests

Clearly, the dependence and the importance of forests to
the national economies has not diminished. This was
demonstrated in the previous assessment and the updates in
Tables t and 2 serve to reinforce this statement. Likewise,
management strategies are urgently needed for the adapta-
tion, mitigation and protection of the forest sector.

Countries must continue to address the socioeconomic
issues related to forests in their response to the impacts of
global and climate change. For example, the Sao Paulo
Conference in 1990 stated clearly that ‘The warming of the
earth is clear evidence that current patterns of economic
activity are not sustainable.’. The conference identified the
vulnerability of a number of patterns of activity for the
developing countries.

2 Reforestation/afforestation and more managed
forests

The need for reforestation/afforestation is a global issue
that must involve all countries.

further effort to ensure that appropriate definitions were —
used for each forest type and objective.’. Other problems
cited included the use of various nomenclature and the

Further work is needed to liberalise current economic
theories to account for the human demands and behavioural
shifts within society. For example, current studies indicate
that the greatest impact on atmospheric carbon can be
realised by halting deforestation compared to promoting
reforestation. However, the former solution may not be
realistic as ‘the depletive pressure is likely to increase if
only through growing human numbers and growing human
demands.’ (Houghton 1991). In addition, the IPCC Impacts
Assessment (1990) summarised the substantial potential
that exists to increase the growth performance of managed
tropical stands with rates of carbon sequestration that are
more than twice the rates of managed forests in temperate
or boreal regions.

Forests are a most significant renewable resource of
biomass, timber, and fibre. Due to their extent forests have
a large effect on the global carbon cycle. They are at the
same time sinks, sources and reservoirs of carbon. The
role of forests to the global carbon cycle is universally
recognised as a sink for carbon, especially in the temperate
and boreal regions (Sedjo 1992, Kauppi et al. 1992), but
forests also provide valuable benefits as resources in the
short term and in the long term to biodiversity. However,
there needs to be an increased effort to quantify the global
carbon estimates and the socioeconomic benefits. This
includes the development of analytical models that account
for the exchanges of carbon within the ecosystem and the
relative contribution of forests, under different assumptions
such as species types, soil conditions and various land use
patterns etc. Robust estimates of the costs of carbon
sequestered through afforestation are needed. These
science-based models would have wide applicability in
other countries as a shared resource and should not be
restricted by proprietary rights. The universality of this
type of scientific transfer should be encouraged to facilitate
changes in policy.

5 Recommendations/conclusions

¢ The data on resources reinforces the vulnerability of
the forest in all countries. Climate change will. im-
pinge on the social and economic sustainability of
these forests. Results since the 1990 IPCC Impact
Assessment. reinforce the political and economic
urgency in this sector.

* More reforestation and afforestation programs are
recommended. The major goal is to sequester carbon
but other benefits must not be neglected. Policies must
take a holistic view and consider the cumulative
benefits of forests.

¢ Research needs must centre on regional impacts
studies, process studies, and the establishment and
definition of the socioeconomic linkages.

¢ Forest monitoring and development of analytical
models are essential, and must be widely applicable,
acceptable and consistent for all countries.

¢ Research leading up to the IPCC Impacts Assessment
and subsequent work, has amply demonstrated the
continuing need for intensive and accurate technical

and financial cooperation to optimise the management *

of our global forest. This assumes that there are. or
will be programs in place that take advantage of local
and regional opportunities, particularly, and wherever
possible within institutional infrastructures.

1 Background

?
As identified in the IPCC Impacts Assessment (1990),
natural terrestrial ecosystems could face significant envi-
ronmental impacts as a result of the global increases in the
atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases and the
associated climatic changes, as well as from the increasing
UV-B radiation due to the atmospheric ozone depletion and
the combined effect of biospheric oxidants and acidic
depositions. The rate of these changes will be the major
factor determining the type and degree of impacts. The
type of disturbances resulting from climate change will be
unique for each ecosystem and the community within, as
each responds to the added pressure of a changing environ-
ment. Adding to the complexity of assessing these changes
is that they could occur as a series of ‘jumps’ rather than
in a uniform manner acrogs an area like a ‘moving wave’
(Holten and Carey 1991).

The social and economic consequences of these
impacts will be significant, especially for those regions of
the globe where societies and related economies are
dependent on natural terrestrial ecosystems for their social
and economic welfare. Projected changes within natural
terrestrial ecosystems suggest that changes in the availabili-
ty of food, fuel, medicine, fibre, construction materials
and income are possible,

2 Progress since the IPCC Impacts Assessment

One of the major issues arising from the impacts of climate
change on terrestrial ecosystems is water availability. This
will be of increasing concern as populations increase and
the need for water for drinking and economic activity (eg

"Projected climate change may be one of the most
important factors affecting fisheries now and in the next
few hundred years, The level of the impact could vary
widely and may depend on attributes of the species as well
as on their regional specificity. Freshwater fish populations
are contained within the bonds of their watershed and in
most cases cannot migrate, but must endure (Shuter and
Post 1990), adapt, suffer population declines or become
extinct (Coutant 1990) when their environment deterio-
rates.

"The added stresses to the freshwater ecosystems
accompanying projected climate changes can be expected,
in the short term, to reduce species number and genetic
diversity within freshwater populations (Everett, in press).
Species that survive a changing environment will likely be
the ones with adequate existing genetic variation to allow
survival and selection of at least some individuals. Whether
the projécted rate of climate change is within the capability
of freshwater species to adapt genetically will depend on
the existing genetic variability and on the rapidity of
change (Mathews and Simmerman 1990).

With projected climate change, profound impacts, both
beneficial and destructive, can be expegted for the
distribution and productivity of valuable fisheries and the
industries associated with them (Healey 1990; Hill and
Magnuson 1990; Johnson and Evans 1990). Among the
first fish populations responding to climate change will
probably be those in streams (a high rate of heat transfer
from the air) on the warm or cold margins of their species’
native ranges (Holmes 1990), With warming, a longer
growing season is expected which should lead to greater
fish productivity where temperature is currently a limiting
factor, such as in high latitude lakes and reservoirs
(Schlesinger and McCombie 1983). Species whose current
distribution is confined to cool waters may be eliminated
from parts of their range, leading to reduced fisheries, in
Spite of higher growth rates of the species that can tolerate
warmer water.

The significance of the environmental impacts and socio-
economic consequences as a’ result of climate change
(IPCC Impacts Assessment 1990) and the néed to develop
viable and effective response strategies warrants the
allocation of sufficient resources to tackle these deficien-
cies through climate impacts research, management,
awareness raising, national and international cooperation
ete.

Within many developing countries, most of the climate
change impacts activities (and for the environment in
general) are orchestrated by outside agencies with little
input from local scientific/technical experts. The capability
of developing countries of taking long-term views and to
initiate programs on climate change impacts is hampered
by lack of the necessary institutional framework. In
addition, the monitoring networks within many developing
countries are either too sparsely distributed or unservice-
able to allow for a worthwhile assessment of the impacts
of, and responses to, climate change at the regional level.

The most urgent need is for fundamental research on
the sensitivity and likely response of key physical and
biological constituents of critical ecosystems (including
those locally defined) to climatic variability and change.
This research should also include wildlife and freshwater
fish populations for which currently there ‘is very little
information available.

"6 Identifying the linkages with climate change and
greenhouse gas concentrations

A focus for systematic observations of natural terrestrial
ecosystems should be the identification of a set of wildlife
and vegetation indicator species which could be used for
detecting climate-induced ecosystem changes and to assist
in quantifying vegetation, wildlife and freshwater fish
sensitivity to climate and possible responses to climate
change. Rather than trying to predict what will happen
when climate changes, focus should be placed on assessing
the sensitivity of species for climate change (thresholds/
limits) in order to ‘select indicator species which may be
used to detect effects of climate change ‘in the field’. In
selecting indicator species consideration should be given to
species which are expected to expand their range of
distribution (horizontally and/or vertically), species which
are expected to retreat or become extinct, and species:
which have a wide distribution with many ecotypes which
may increase or decrease in abundance within the present
range of distribution (Ketner and de Groot, in press).

Once identified, the distribution of indicator species
should be systematically mapped using a grid system that
lends itself to various modelling approaches, including
computer-based models.

Related research should focus on identifying the
cause/effect relationships between climate, ecosystems
processes (eg biophysical, biochemical, geochemical
processes), functions (eg habitat, water quantity and
quality), distribution and productivity and associated
wildlife and freshwater resources. Such research programs
should be interdisciplinary by nature and not only assess
the impacts of direct changes in climate, but also the
effects of associated changes in soils, water regimes, and
landscape structure and functions.

Water resources management, by its nature, is intend-
ed and has served to ameliorate the extremes in climate
variability. It stands to reason, then, that managed water-
sheds, ie those under some form of water control and
distribution, are apt to experience less dramatic water re-
sources impacts than those without such water management
systems even though the natural hydrologic response may
be similar. However, specific regional changes in precipi-
tation and runoff are as yet impossible to predict with any
degree of confidence (US National Academy of Sciences
1992; Chahine 1992). For hydrologic studies, precipitation
is the variable of greatest interest, but GCM simulations of
precipitation for present climate conditions are notoriously

on decreases in mean annual runoff, but some areas may

1 Introduction

Since the IPCC Climate Change Impacts Assessment report
(1990b), a substantial number of studies have been under-
taken that deal with the hydrologic effects and water
resources management impacts of global warming. |
Although the body of information is growing rapidly, espe-
cially the proliferation of case studies of hydrologic
impacts, few new insights have been offered by these stud-
ies, especially for water resources management impacts.
This is due largely to the reality that the analyses are based
on General Circulation Model (GCM) outputs which sim-
ply do not provide the information required for such
analyses, nor are the results compatible with one another
for the five GCMs most frequently cited (US National
Academy of Sciences 1992). Overall, the recent studies
have confirmed the findings and conclusions of the 1990
Impacts Assessment, albeit with nuances and refinements
that were not explicitly considered then.

Among the difficulties in trying to interpret and
compare the findings was that a great majority of studies
were conducted without regard to conventional impact
assessment and evaluation principles, while also ignoring
IPCC global warming scenarios. This diminished their
direct value in trying to understand the hydrologic response
sensitivity, not to mention the comparative value in
examining cross-regional impacts of global change on the
vulnerability of comparably managed water resources. The
impacts of climate change on watershed response and the
vulnerability of managed systems presents a greater degree
of evaluation difficulty; the few studies that have attempted
to deal with these issues should be viewed in the context of
an evolving yet tenuous methodology. ‘

Even though evidence for global warming and itslong-
range impacts is becoming more compelling with each new

report, like it or not, there is still considerable disagree-

The studies and analyses that were _ made available
subsequent to the IPCC Impacts Assessment which
assessed the hydrologic and water resources management
consequences of climate change reflected the range of ap-
proaches that have been pursued in the past by scientists,
hydrologists and water resources engineers. These include:

of changes in climatic and hydrologic characteristics; use
of deterministic hydrologic models; statistical analysis of

vancement of Science (Waggoner (ed.) 1990), and a con-
ference of practising US federal water resources agencies
and water utility managers (Ballentine and Stakhiv (eds)
1992).

Since the first assessment of the IPCC (1990a,b,c),
scientists participating in the Impacts Assessment Working
Group II realised that producing an estimate for water re-
sources availability and other conditions extant within a
climate that may exist 50 or 100 years hence, could be
misleading at best, and completely unrealistic at worst.
The reason is that the first step of analysing the cumulative
consequences of global warming requires that the physical
changes of hydrologic effects associated with climate
change be differentiated from ‘normal’ climate variability
as derived from historic records. Second, future water
resources management impacts (water use, availability,
distribution, operation and maintenance etc) should be
viewed only as an increment (or decrement) to the water
supply and use trends that are likely to occur under the
‘baseline’ or ‘without’ climate change scenario. The
indicators of water use that reflect the baseline condition,
projected over a period of 50 to 100 years will, in all

growth, and patterns of land use and settlement. These
socioeconomic changes would severely stress existing

The inability to forecast precipitation, runoff and
evapotranspiration accurately should not be used as an
argument to negate the application of GCMs to river basin
level assessments, nor to diminish the value of undertaking
hydrologic sensitivity analyses of the various postulated
climate change scenarios. Rather, the caveats are intended
to be cautionary in tenor - as a way of recognising that
much too little is ‘known’ with certainty and spurious
conclusions are drawn too often from information that is,
at best, suggestive in nature. Towards this end, the focus
of future IPCC efforts should be to develop a more uniform
methodology for impact assessments as part of a continuing
effort of targeting regional river basin and country studies
in order to obtain a reasonably comparable basis for
evaluation.

Hence, this update and assessment of recently avail-
able information is presented in the spirit of simply
compiling the latest information, without a rigorous
comparative analysis and evaluation, for it is simply too
difficult to judge the relative merit of various inquiries
inasmuch as a formal and consistent evaluative framework —
is yer to be formulated. There are no accepted standards
for analysis, However, a number of principles and
preliminary guidelines for assessing impacts of climate
change were developed by an expert group assembled by
the IPCC (1992d), but they have yet to be applied.

that since the publication of the first IPCC Impacts Asess-

results were not yet available for this report. Similarly,

- many recent publications delve into better understanding of
historical climate changes as an implicit analog or baseline
for extrapolating future changes (eg studies of the El Niiio

not included as they did not explicitly deal with evidence
of hydrologic changes induced by anthropogenic global
warming. Most studies focused on understanding the
sensitivity of hydrologic response to climatic perturbations.

A critical aspect of water resources management is an
understanding of the statistical properties of climate and
weather-driven events, such as floods and droughts. For
it is the extremes of precipitation and runoff that influence
design criteria and management strategies. Little research
has been done linking climate change with fréquency of
flood or drought, although several earlier attempts were
made to place the implications of climate change and
variability within the context of water resources system
yield reliability using methods based on stochastic hydro-
logic analysis (Lettenmaier and Burges 1978; Matalas and
Fiering 1977; Nemec and Schaake’ 1982; Klemes 1985;
Fiering and Rogers 1989). A recent study by Wood et-al.
(1992) laid-out a procedure for assessing the impact of
climate change on the flood frequency distribution for a
river basin and tested the methods for CO, doubling
scenarios produced by the GFDLGCM. First, the authors
note that the GFDL GCM failed to reproduce the historical
climate characteristics for all seasons, uniformly underes-
timating precipitation for the two watersheds in the State
of Washington in north-western US In fact, the. differ-
ences: between historical precipitation and the present GCM
climate simulations were larger than the differences
predicted between the GCM IxCO, scenario, (present) and
the 2xCO, scenario. Hence, the authors caution that while
the effect of GCM model biases on their approach may be
diminished by making relative comparisons, one could not
be entirely certain because the models are highly nonlinear.
Notwithstanding the caveats, the authors concluded on the
basis of their test that stochastic transfer models offer a
quantitative means of linking large-scale circulation condi-
tions, as inferred from GCMs to local surface meteorolog-
ical conditions, and can provide information for evaluating
climate change impacts on flood frequencies.

Methodological approaches varied widely, so it would
be inappropriate to infer that the studies portray distin-
guishable patterns of regional or geographic response,
despite the fact that the recent suite of water-resources-
related climate studies cover a much larger and diverse
geographic area, It is impossible to.draw'any specific in-
sights or conclusions about regional, river basin or water-
, shed-level impacts because of wide differences among the
GCMs and different analytical approaches that were used
in these studies. In other words, the impacts will depend
on the characteristics of the river basin, the GCM selected,
and on the particular analytical method pursued. Given the

_ large uncertainties associated with GCM outputs, it is
premature to use them for predictive purposes. At best,
they may have a heuristic value for setting the stage for the
next phase of detailed hydrologic impact studies.

Nevertheless, there are several recent noteworthy
studies that shed some new light on the difficulties of
conducting hydrologic sensitivity studies and potential
water management responses, and which serve as caution-
ary reminders of a few principles and insights that may
serve future endeavours.- For example, Kuhl and Miller
(1992) compared the GISS GCM hindcasts with observed
runoff of the 20 largest rivers in the world and found
systematic overestimation of the mean annual runoff.
Furthermore, for several of the rivers (Mississippi, Amur,
Colorado, Indus, Murray) the model’s spring maximum
runoff was significantly larger than observed, and the
minimum summer and autumn runoff was too low.

Nash and Gleick (1991) studied the hydrologic re-
sponse of the Colorado River (US) and compared their re-
sults, using a well-calibrated water balance accounting
model, with several previous statistical studies for the same
river. The authors concluded that the nrevious studies

water uses, demands and projections were developed. For
the MINK area, irrigation withdrawals were projected to
increase by 14% and consumptive uses by 23% without
employing rational adjustments. Crop yields would decline
from 10 to.25% in the absence of adjustments, and plant
requirements for irrigation water would increase by about
20%. However, as a compensating factor, it is expected
that the direct effects of increasing CO, concentration from
350. to 450 ppm would reduce irrigation requirements by
10% (Easterling et al. 1991). Wollock and Hornberger
(1991) examined changes in assumptions about the effects
of plant stomatal resistance changes due to the CO, enrich-
ment effect on the sensitivity of catchment runoff. They
found that lack of good information led to large variability
in the projections of runoff response. Most importantly,
perhaps, is that despite all the uncertainties, the adverse re-
gional economic impacts of such a drastic drought condi-
tion was found to’be small, in the order of several percent-

Finally, in one of the few available studies of the
vulnerability of managed urban water resources systems,
Kirshen and Fennessey (1992) analysed the potential
impacts of climate change on the water supply of the
Boston metropolitan area, which represents a large, well~
managed urban water supply system. The study included
a hydrologic analysis of various climate change scenarios,
comparing the outputs of several GCM models (GISS,
GFDL, UKMO and OSU) and an associated analysis of
water management impacts, including financial and eco-
nomic consequences and potential responses. The authors
showed that the GISS and GFDL models generally predict-
ed decreased watershed yield whereas the OSU and
UKMO GCM scenarios indicated increases in-runoff and
increases in system safe yield. As a result of these
contradictory outcomes, the Massachusetts Water Re-
sources Authority’ (MWRA) is taking a ‘wait and see’
response similar to that of other urban US water utility
managers (Schwarz and Dillard 1990) because they believe
that the impacts of climate change are too uncertain and
the costs of action are too high to warrant such actions.
However, the MWRA has engaged in an aggressive
program of cost-effective demand management and water
conservation actions that, in effect, represent the founda-
tion of a sensible anticipatory adaptive strategy. Similar
institutional responses are expected in most urban metro-
politan regions, whether the cause is growth in water
demand or in water shortages caused by droughts or global
climate change (Rhodes, Miller and MacDonnell 1992;
Frederick 1992; Rogers 1992; and Stakhiv 1992).

Studies have been carried out for the river basins and
regions located in various natural climatic zones (tem-

humid tropical) as well as by using palaeoclimatic scen-
arios for the continents of the Earth as a whole.
Temperate zones are most comprehensively presented in
the studies’ on European countries for the river basins
where most of the annual runoff is formed as a result of
snowmelt in spring.

The impacts of climate change on groundwater has
received fittle attention, although a recent evaluation of
Australia’s major aquifers represents an awakening to the
importance that groundwater recharge and management has
in the overall scheme for water resources management.
Ghassemi et al. (1991) have noted that precipitation trends
have changed markedly in this century over Australia and
they expect trends and patterns to continue with global
warming. Overall, they conclude that for a large area of
Australia, especially the populated south-eastern quadrant,
where groundwater is already overdrafted, groundwater
recharge will increase. The shallow aquifers in the arid
and semi-arid zones of Australia (eg the Amadeus basin)
will also benefit from increased precipitation and recharge.
However, global warming will likely be detrimental for a
number of major regional aquifers in south-western
Australia, in the Perth basin and Murray basin, because of
decreased rainfall.

increases of 2 to 6°C and monthly precipitation increases
of 10 to 30 mm were produced by the GISS model. The
results showed 20 to 50% increases in mean annual runoff
for individual watersheds, and a more stable interannual
monthly runoff pattern for most watersheds (Vehvilainen
and Lohvansuu 1991). Maximum spring discharges were
found to decrease considerably (up to 55%) and minimum
monthly flows to rise dramatically (up to 100 to 300%).

Hydrologic sensitivity studies in Norway relied on a
comparison of two assumed (non-GCM) scenarios for CO,
doubling by the year 2030. According to the first scen-
ario, winter temperature would rise by 3.0 to 3.2°C,
summer by 1.5 to 2.0°C and annual precipitation by 5 to
15%. According to the second scenario, by 3.5 to 5.0°C
and 15 to 20%, respectively. The changes in runoff for
seven regions in Norway were calculated by using an
existing simplified conceptual hydrological model for a 30-
year historic period and the two climate scenarios
(Saelthun et al. 1990). The results show that annual runoff
increased somewhat (up to 10 to 15%) in the mountainous
regions and in the regions with large annual precipitation.
In low forested areas, it decreased slightly. Seasonal
runoff changes significantly: spring floods decrease; winter
runoff increases substantially, while summer runoff
decreases. The frequency of floods increases in autumn
and winter (Saelthun et al. 1990).

Kaczmarek and Krasuski (1991) obtained very similar
results for one of Poland’s largest rivers, Varty (area is
54 530 km’), using CO, doubling scenarios generated by
the GFDL model coupled with a monthly water balance
hydrological model. With global warming the annual
runoff of this river changes, but slightly. However, winter
runoff rises (21%) and summer runoff decreases (24%).
Similar results have been obtained for small and medium-
’ sized watersheds in Belgium and Switzerland. Studies -
were conducted by Bultot et al. (1991) and Gellens
(1991a;1991b) who applied GCM scenarios with the
conceptual hydrological model of the Royal Meteorological
Institute of Belgium with a diurnal time interval. For
example, comprehensive studiés of an experimental basin
in Switzerland reveal relatively insignificant changes in
annual runoff with increasing winter runoff by 10% and
decreasing the summer one by 11% (Bultot et al. 1991)

In perhaps the best existing suite of comparative water
management studies available, the US Environmental
Protection Agency (1990) initiated a comparison of five
complex river basin management schemes of the La
Plata/Uruguay, Mekong, Indus, Zambezi and. Nile Rivers.
Only preliminary analyses of the Mekong, Uruguay and
‘Zambezi Rivers were available for this assessment. A
similar effort, undertaken by the United National Environ-
ment Programme (Parry, Magalhaes and Ninh (eds) 1991)
compared impacts for Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia and
Thailand, although the analysis for Brazil examined only
the impacts of current climate variability and drought on
agriculture. Overall, the analysis for Southeast Asia was
conducted by comparing three GCMs (GISS, GFDL, and
OSU). CO,-doubling analyses for Indonesia were focused
~ on agricultural impacts, showing higher levels of precip-
itation, which increased the area of potential agriculture,
but also increased soil erosion and loss of productivity. In
Malaysia, there did not appear to be a significant change
in the seasonal pattern in rainfall. Rice yields were
expected to decrease because of an increase in temperature .
and decrease in solar radiation due to increased cloudiness.
Results of CO,-doubling for Thailand (GISS model) shows
a warming of 3 to 6°C, and a significant reduction in
precipitation, Northern Thailand would be drier in most
months, which would be a benefit to agriculture in that
area. Overall, the methods used were not comparable, and
the results.presented in these studies were inconsistent and
highly variable among the three countries, as they were
conducted by different groups.

The Mekong River is among the largest rivers in the
world, with almost three-quarters of the watershed lying
within the tropical zone; its climate is controlled largely by
seasonal monsoons. In a study conducted by the Mekong
Secretariat (1990), equilibrium scenario outputs of three
GCMs (GISS, GFDL, UKMO) were compared for water

"scenarios (exponential and arithmetic growth of CO,). For
all the hydrologic stations analysed, all the climate scenario’
forecasts showed longer dry periods and. wet periods.
Also, the patterns of monthly rainfall generally shifted one
to two months earlier in the monsoon season, along with
the time of occurrence of the driest. and wettest months.
Generally, rainfall increased significantly in the wet
months, while the decrease in the dry months was smaller,
although the duration of rainfall-deficient months in-
creased. Reservoir operations would have to change to
accommodate the greater variability in peak flows and low-
flow periods. Hydro-electric power production will be
affected, but irrigation releases would not be affected. The
authors concluded that new reservoir operation rules would
mitigate many of the potential adverse effects.

In the study of the Uruguay River (Tucci and Damiani
1991), which was part of the triad of studies conducted for
the US Environmental Agency, the authors generally
followed the same approach as for the Mekong River.
They compared three GCMs (GISS, GFDL, UKMO) with
both equilibrium and transient CO,- doubling scenarios.
They found that al! the models underestimate total historic
rainfall, but that the GISS model performed the best in
terms of replicating modern historic conditions. A hydro-
logic model was used to estimate flows in the Uruguay
River from the precipitation generated by the GCMs. The
predicted flows indicated an 11.7% decrease with the GISS
model; a 21.5% increase with the GFDL and a 6.4%
decrease with the UKMO model. The GISS transient
model also showed an 11.7% reduction in mean flows.

All the GCM models predicted lower dry-season flows
for the Uruguay River, but the models differed widely on
the inter-annual variation of flows and on the magnitude of
peak flows. The. study did focus on water management
impacts, as the basin is developed and managed for hydro-
electric power, flood control, irrigation and water supply.
Much more hydro-electric power is planned for the basin,
hence the impacts on hydro-electric production was
considered very important. However, the different models
generated contradictory results. For example, the UKMO
and GISS models predicted a decrease in hydro-electric
power output of 2.5 to 4.75%, whereas the GFDL model
showed an increase of 17.3%. Three of the four model
scenarios predict smaller and fewer floods, resulting in
flood damage avoidance benefits. However, reduction in
low. flows and lengthening of low flow duration was
forecast, showing decreases of 3 to 18%. This implies a
greater frequency of failure and water rationing, especially
for irrigation withdrawals.

Analysis of the impacts of climate change on water
resources management of the Zambezi River was con-
ducted by Urbiztondo et al. (1991) for the US Environ-
mental Protection Agency (1990). Preliminary results of

Furthermore, water resources management is a highly
dynamic and adaptive endeavour in the sense that new
technologies, economic instruments, institutional and legal
changes, and demand management measures are constantly
being introduced, tested and employed as water scarcity
becomes a chronic problem (Frederick 1992), Hence, the
various strategies outlined in the Resource Use and

to be re-examined. All these issues have been treated, to
varying degrees, for several river-basins with prescribed
climate scenarios both in the Northern and Southern Hemi-
spheres.

Climate uncertainty and water management was the |
topic of two recent conferences in the United States (NRC
1991; Ballentine and Stakhiv (eds) 1992). Rogers (1992)
addressed the role that uncertainty of climate change
information played in decision making related to water
management issues. Rogers essentially concludéd that

‘even if the GCM models were scientifically well grounded
and their prediction considered perfect, the information
provided is largely peripheral to practical engineering
decisions. The reason is that hydrology and availability of
water is only one among several important factors in water
management decisions, which include economic, political,
sociological, technological and demographic consideration.
There are three categories of decisions in water resources
planning and: management: planning and design that goes

Increased variability of floods and droughts will
require a re-examination of engineering design as-
sumptions, operating rules, system optimisation and
contingency planning for existing and planned water
management systems,

More studies on hydrologic sensitivity and water re-
source management vulnerability need to be directed
towards arid and semi-arid regions and small island
states, :

A uniform approach to the climate change hydrologic
sensitivity analyses needs to be developed for com-
parability of results.

"Significant progress has been made in hydrologic
sensitivity analyses in developed countries, yet large
gaps exist in the information base regarding the

nations,

Comparative sensitivity analyses that rely on existing
GCMs offer generic insights regarding the physical
hydrologic effects and water resources management
impacts, but the. differences in the. outputs of the
GCMs coupled with large differences in hydrologic
sensitivity analyses makes it difficult ta offer region-
specific impact assessments,

Temporal streamflow characteristics in virtually all
regions exhibited greater variability and amplification:
of extremes, with larger flood volumes and peak flows
as well as increased flow episodes and a shift in the
turning of the seasonal runoff;

The higher the degree of water control, regulation and
management of sectoral water demands, the smaller
the anticipated adverse effects of global warming.
Conversely, unregulated hydrologic systems are more.
vulnerable to potential hydrologic alterations.

"runor to the winter months had a large impact on the
reliability of water deliveries to the various water supply
users and on the flood control capabilities of the system.
Two conceptual studies for sizing the optimal capacity
and developing ideal operating rules for the design of
hypothetical reservoirs under climate uncertainty were
undertaken by Fiering and Rogers (1989) and Lettenmaier
et al. (1990). Both studies attempted better to understand
the vulnerability, resilience and robustness of reservoirs
and managed systems under climate uncertainty as a way
of improving the design of new systems and operation of
existing systems. Essentially both studies confirmed an
intuitive notion, that water supply performance, ie the
minimisation of shortages or failures (or maximisation of
reliability) is controlled more by reservoir storage capacity
than by any variation in operating policy. Lettenmaier
and Gan (1990) varied reservoir capacity from 0.25 to
0.50 of mean annual runoff. Fiering and Rogers (1989)
showed that reservoir reliability did not change much with
changes in the climate-induced variation in runoff if the
reservoir capacity was larger than 0.5 of the mean annual
runoff. ‘ .
As a whole, the studies on water resources and water
management effects of climate change allow the corrobo-
ration of the following inference: under the condition of
global warming and a great uncertainty of local climate
variability, large water management systems are capable of
greater flexibility in adapting to changes in timing and
magnitude of runoff. In this connection, the watersheds
with a large degree of control over river runoff under
global warming would have considerable advantages for
redistributing the available water supply and flood control
compared to the regions with natural unregulated runoff
regimes.

The blue, clear waters ‘of tropical/subtropical regions
are relatively poor in nutrient. It is not expected that a
modest increase in temperature will significantly affect the
fisheries except in some shallow lagoons where salinity
may affect productivity, particularly if juvenile organisms
have a critical dependence on salinity or temperature.
Increased alongshore winds, however, could lead to
increased coastal upwelling along some continental coasts
(Aparicio 1992), or to other oceanic circulation changes,
(Gallegos et al. 1992), and thus to increased productivity
(cf Vicente et al.” 1992).

Tropical fish eggs hatch very quickly (12-18 hours),
and development is associated with temperature. Just as
‘cold snaps’ can be devastating, so can ‘hot snaps’,
particularly during early juvenile stages. Extremes in
temperature are usually averaged out in climate analysis,
but with increased temperature, the likelihood of ‘hot
snaps’ increases; the 1987 Caribbean coral bleaching event
is attributed by some researchers (Williams et al. 1987) to
‘hot snaps’. The complexities of the ecosystems could be
greatly affected by slight temperature changes. It is not
known, for example, why fish stocks either decline or
increase by orders of magnitude, other than owing to early
life history events caused directly by the physical environ-
ment or indirectly through complex chains in ecosystems
dynamics. Temperature effects on tropical fisheries, as for
those in other latitudes, remains an important and un-
answered question, although there is some evidence of fish
migration associated with increased coastal temperatures.

In the tropics, marine organisms live closer to their
maximum thermal tolerance than those in more temperate
climates (Vincente et al. 1992). Although the 1.5°C
temperature rise scenario would raise the summertime
meéan temperature to 30.5°C over much of the tropi-
cal/subtropical region, most migratory organisms are
expected to be able to tolerate such a change. Some corals
will be affected (viz the 1983 and 1987 bleaching events),
but it is expected that other environmental stresses will be
more important (Milliman 1992). Intertidal plants and
animals, such as mangroves, are adapted to withstand high
temperature, and unless the 1.5°C increase affects repro-
duction, the rise in temperature will probably cause
unmeasurable results (Snedaker 1992). Similarly, only
seagrass beds already located in thermal stress situations
(ie in shallow lagoons or near power plant effluent) are
expected to become negatively affected by the projected
IPCC (1990b) temperature rise.

coastal land bands, lower islands and individual rock
debris. The nursery areas of some valuable fish species are
located in the shallow water deltas of the Bering Sea
rivers. Sea-level rise will reduce the size of the habitat of
numerous birds, mammals and fish. The sea-level rise will
also affect the distribution of plant life along the Bering
Sea shores, particularly the Fucus type algae inhabiting the
depth down to 0.5 m. These algae will partially or com-
pletely die off or be replaced by others.

Mangrove forests are a unique feature of protected
coastal shorelines of the tropics and subtropics; their root
systems (prop roots and pneumatophores) stabilise the
sediment, dampen wave energy, provide habitat shelter for
numerous organisms and form the basis for the nearshore
marine food web (Vicente et al. 1992). The five species
comprising the mangrove flora of the Caribbean/Gulf of
Mexico/Bahamas region occupy an area of approximately
3.2 million hectares, or some 15% of the estimated world
area of mangrove of 22 million hectares. The best devel-
oped mangrove forests are associated with areas of high |
precipitation and upstream runoff. Thus, in terms of global
climate change, future changes in patterns of precipitation
and runoff will have impacts on mangroves (Snedaker
1992). Mangroves grow best in moderately saline environ-
ments where the rate of peat production exceeds the
anaerobic decomposition of peat by marine sulphate
reducing micro-organisms, and by this process, low-island
mangroves could keep up with sea-level rise of up to 12
cm/100 years. Mangroves of high islands and continents
also accumulate. sediment from river discharge, hence can
keep up with higher rates of sea-level rise (Ellison and
Stoddart 1991). The current high rate of regional
mangrove loss by overcutting, land clearing and habitat
conversion suggests that global climate change is a minor
factor -in considerations of the fate of this regionally
important coastal habitat.

substrate, wave energy, or bottom slope, the seagrass beds
may be impacted. :

The impact of sea-level rise on fisheries is not expect-
ed to be great unless turbidity increases due to erosion
from higher water or river runoff. Turbidity increase could
have a negative impact on fisheries particularly during the
early life history stage (W Richards, NOAA/ NMFS,
personal communication). Estuariné-dependent species in
areas such as Mississippi; the Florida Everglades, Guyana
and ‘the Orinoco Delta, may be particularly vulnerable to
sea-level rise, especially if salinity changes are involved.

3.3 Southeast Asia region

Parry et al. (1991) reported on potential effects of climate
change for Brazil, Malaysia/Thailand/Indonesia and
Vietnam, but did not discuss sea-level rise for Brazil.
Much of the area of Malaysia/Thailand/Indonesia is
characterised by low-lying coastal plain where a 35 cm rise
in mean sea-level will lead to a shoreward advance of
seawater of almost 1 km. On sandy beach coasts, sea-level
rise would tend to initiate beach erosion or accelerate it
where it is already taking place. There are large areas of
swampy lowland in Southeast Asia, especially. on the
shores of deltas, where sea-level rise will tend to curb the
accreting coasts, :

The natural vegetation associated with the coastal
lowlands of Southeast Asia is mangrove swamp backed by
marshes and areas of freshwater forest. In many areas this
vegetation has been profoundly modified by drainage and
land reclamation. Extensive areas of mangroves have also
been converted to ponds for the production of fish or
prawns. Where mangroves have been converted to maricul-
ture, sea-level rise will threaten to breach the enclosing
banks.and submerge the mariculture ponds. Coral reefs on
the other hand have growth rates (as with the Caribbean)
that can keep up with sea-level rise, except fringing reefs,
which are less likely to survive than outlying reefs,
because of increased turbidity in coastal waters,

6.4. Modelling

Tn order to strengthen quantitative information transfer -

to states, regional climate models nested in coupled
ocean-atmosphere global circulation models are
needed. This effort must include a vigorous, stable,
long-term in situ verification program (such as
GOOS), coupled with an active multi-disciplinary
research effort, which should include examination of
the historical, geological, and archaeological records.
Numerical socioeconomic model development, valida-
tion, transfer and use training should be initiated. This
new class of models require customisation for individ-
ual nations/regions. Adequate database development
must progress in parallel with the model development.
Coastal zone managers will require modest training
and this should be given high priority within IOC/

’ WMO/UNEP education programs.

The study of the impacts of climate ‘change on the
terrestrial components of the cryosphere is in its infancy
and there are many uncertainties regarding the relation-
ships and sensitivities of snow and ice masses to climate
and climate changes especially at the local and regional
levels.
"	Text
"The terrestrial component of the cryosphere includes the
seasonal snow cover, mountain glaciers, terrestrial ice
sheets, frozen ground including permafrost (ground that
remains frozen for more than one year) and seasonally
frozen ground. In conjunction with projected changes in
climate associated with enhanced atmospheric concentra-
tions of greenhouse gases, the global area! extent and
volume of these elements of the terrestrial cryosphere are
expected to be substantially reduced (Climate Change: The
IPCC Impacts Assessment, 1990). These reductions, when
reflected regionally, could have significant impacts on
related ecosystems (both natural and managed) and on
social and economic activities. For example, the projected
reductions in the area and volume of seasonal snow cover
(including changes in the length of the season) and the
recession of glacial ice sheets wil] impact on local and
regional water resources. In the case of permafrost,
projected increases in the thickness of the freeze-thaw layer
above the permafrost and recession of permafrost to higher
latitudes and altitudes could lead to increases in terrain
instability, erosion and landslides in those areas which
currently contain permafrost. These changes could alter
overlying ecosystems and affect existing human settlements

temperatures, snow cover has decreased in the Mackenzie
Valley. Under this combination of climatic changes
permafrost could grow, not diminish, in this region (Stuart
and Judge 1992).

2.2 Permafrost

The raising of mean. annual air temperatures by 2°C is
projected to result in a shift of the southern boundary of |
permafrost areas in Russia approximately 250-300 km to
the north and northeast. A warming of this magnitude is
also. expected to cause the receding of permafrost areas on
the plateaus of Tjyan Shan and the vanishing of those in
Pamir with only spotty discontinuous areas remaining. ~
Based on mathematical models, permafrost could lose
2-6% of its ‘cold reserves’ during the period 1990-2040
as a'result of projected global warming.

The above normal temperatures throughout much of
the Northern Hemisphere in 1989 led to the initiation of
extensive active layer detachment -slides in Ellesmere
Island, Canada, and in the Yamal Peninsula in the Russian
Arctic. A thicker active layer intersected the top of
massive ice triggering the failures which are continuing to
spread in these areas. This condition, at least in the Yamal
. Peninsula, has led to the damming of streams, increased
sediment loads in streams, and has initiated ongoing thaw
and further failures.

Allen et al. (1988) have identified the growth and
decay of permafrost in the Mackenzie Delta, Canada, over
the past 75 000 years based on deep temperature records
and the palacoclimatic history. Rozenberg et al. (1985)
have documented multilayered permafrost in the Mackenzie
Delta, and Collett et al. (1988) have shown a similar

good evidence now (Koerner and Brugman 1991) that
glaciers in the Northern Hemisphere polar and subpolar
regions are receding at a slower rate than previously
suggested. In addition, all glaciers measured in Iceland

The number and areal coverage of long-term systemat-

cryosphere and the impacts of climate change on them
individually and together. Some such systematic observa-

Mackay in the Mackenzie Delta of Canada, Pewe in the

"limited'as a result of the uncertainties regarding the mass
balance of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. In fact,
changes in the mass balance of the Greenland and
Antarctic ice sheets are not certain even as to sign. A
recent compilation of data concerning the Antarctic mass
budget. (areas of the Antarctic Peninsula have not been
included in these calculations) by Bentley and Giovinetto
(1991).has, however, concluded that the ice sheet currently
exhibits a positive balance (ie an excess mass input) of 80
to 400 Gt/year, contributing a drop of 0.2 to 1.1 mm/year
to sea-level change.

With respect to Antarctica, major deficiencies in the
knowledge base can be attributed to lack of knowledge of
the accumulation rate over most of Antarctica, the ‘basal
melting rate of the ice shelves, and the ice calving rate
along the entire margin of Antarctica. For the Greenland
ice sheet, insufficient information is available about the
ablation rate (currently restricted to a few years of meas-
urements at a few points) and the calving rates at the fast
moving outlet glaciers (eg Jakobsavn).

These deficiencies make it ‘virtually impossible to
relate changes in the global glacier mass balance to sea-
level change, either in the past or in the near future.
Modelling cannot answer these questions until annual-to-
decadal data on the surface profile of both Greenland and
Antarctica are available. This data requirement will be
realised only if and when the new generation of satellite
altimeters are put into orbit some time in the next century.
For Antarctica there is an additional need to improve the
information available on snow accumulation rates and how
they relate to synoptic weather patterns each year. .

Historical accumulation data obtained retrospectively
from ice cores can provide the perspective on natural
accumulation rate variability which is needed to assess the
significance of more recent changes. An essential aspect of
this as well as other sampling or systematic observation
programs, however, is communication of the resulting data
or information. One notable shortcoming in this area for
Antarctica is that accumulation rates for stations occupied
since 1957 still remain unpublished (Jacka 1991, personal
communication).

Presently, the accurate measurement of the mass
balance of Antarctica and Greenland is unattainable. The
measurement of mass balance on small glaciers and ice
sheets forms a powerful tool for detecting early signs of
climate change of the nature projected by climate models
as it represents an integration of the total energy flux over
each glacier or ice cap, The two components of glacier
balance—ie accumulation and ablation (ice or snow loss)—
constitute measures of two separate parameters of the
projected climate change (ie change in precipitation rate -
substantially higher in the polar regions) and measurable
. higher ice/snow melt rates in summer. This is particularly
important in polar glaciers as they are located in areas
where the maximum climate change is projected to occur.
To improve their effectiveness as indicators, it will be
necessary to identify those changes resulting from local
catchment characteristics and microclimate which can
dominate climate change for many decades.

 
"	Text
"More statistical work is needed on the existing glacier data
(two separate components of accumulation and ablation) to
improve. our knowledge of recent and projected climate
changes, especially in the polar regions where data from
other disciplines is especially sparse.. Glacier-mass budget
data must also be tied in with that derived from ice-core
data to extend our knowledge of past climate change and
place the present changes into true perspective (eg a recent
study of ice cores from Wilkes Land, Antarctica, (Morgan
et al. 1991) indicates increased snow accumulation since
1960, compatible with the mass input increase reported by
Bentley and Giovinetto (1991)). The present warm period
in the Canadian high Arctic is still considerably cooler than
the climate there for over half the interglacial period
beginning 10 000 years ago. The ice core record also
shows that the short period immediately preceding the
present warm one was. the coldest for several thousand
years. It appears that the present glacial recession is from
major advances that took place during: that cold period
(Koerner and Fisher 1990). Seen in that context the present
warming trend is not unusual.

It is still questionable, however, whether satellite
measurements provide the desirable accuracy to detect
surface elevation changes, particularly on small ice sheets
where the required resolution could limit the usefulness of
satellite- derived observations. Modern geodetic techniques
or repeated precision-gravity measurements, coupled with
GPS should be used to provide overlap with future satellite
mapping using improved satellite sensors.

To improve understanding of ice - sheet and glacial
changes and the impacts thereof, it is essential that existing
long-term systematic observations programs be continued
and that programs for representative glacier mass balance
changes and associated climatic and hydrologic variables
be expanded to provide a truly global network. This data
should be supplemented with data derived from ice sheet
elevation surveys by satellite (laser) altimetry such as that
on the EOS/ERS series. Efforts should also be directed at
improving systematic observations and assessments of
iceberg calving from the Antarctic and Greenland ice
sheets,

The most extensive amount of work has been undertaken
in OECD countries, where impacts research has been
undertaken across all sectors listed in the questionnaire.

In developing regions the amount of research activity
varies widely. In the eleven African countries which
responded, although there had often been extensive
consultation, only two countries were undertaking any
activity at all (these being Senegal and Cote D’Ivoire
which are undertaking a wide range of work on impacts).
This and the lack of overall response would indicate that
little substantial work has been done in this region on
impacts. ,

"Appendix A. Analysis of current
climate change

1 Introduction

During the preparation of the First Assessment Report, it
became clear that there were considerable gaps in our
understanding of the potential impacts of climate change,
particularly in the developing countries. As a result of the
interest stimulated by the IPCC process and the activities
of the World Climate Impact Studies Program, many
country studies were initiated to remedy the deficiencies.
The Asia-Pacific Seminar on climate change held in
Nagoya in Japan on 23-26 January 1991 brought together
a number of new studies in countries in the region and
provided an extremely useful supplementary data source.
Before proceeding with any further, studies under the
auspices of the IPCC, it was decided to survey the IPCC
participating countries to.assess the level of current activity
and, in particular, identify regions where work was needed
and issues which had not been identified in the six Tasks
set by the IPCC Plenary. Accordingly, in June 1991, the
Chairman of Working Group II circulated a questionnaire
to all IPCC participating nations seeking their responses.
Thirty-eight countries and eleven international organisa-
tions responded. .

2 Methodology of assessment of responses

The responses were. distributed through the IPCC Secre-
tariat to members of the Steering Group set up at the
Working Group II meeting in Geneva. Three members of
the Steering Group, namely Dr Zwerva, Dr Tegart and Dr
Nazarov, carried out analyses of the available responses.
These analyses were discussed at a meeting in Amsterdam
on 28 October 1991. Somewhat different approaches were
used by the three groups in the presentation of the data.
however, the conclusions reached were essentially ‘similar
with regard to the areas needing attention.

Attempts were made to increase the sample size by
seeking further responses at the IPCC Plenary in
November 1991. A few more countries responded follow-

-ing that meeting.

3 Results of the survey

Thirty-eight countries and eleven international NGOs
responded to the survey. There was a particularly low level
of response. from Asian, North and Central American and
South Pacific island countries. While there was a good
response from developed countries, there were notable
exceptions, including the United States and Germany.
