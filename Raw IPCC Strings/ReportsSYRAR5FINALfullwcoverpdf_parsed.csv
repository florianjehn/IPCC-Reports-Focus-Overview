"he Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the leading international body for the assessment

of climate change. It was established by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World
Meteorological Organization (WMO) to provide an authoritative international assessment of the scientific
aspects of climate change, based on the most recent scientific, technical and socio-economic information
published worldwide. The IPCC’s periodic assessments of the causes, impacts and possible response strategies
to climate change are the most comprehensive and up-to-date reports available on the subject, and form the
standard reference for all concerned with climate change in academia, government and industry worldwide. This
Synthesis Report is the fourth element of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, Climate Change 2013/2014. More than
800 international experts assessed climate change in this Fifth Assessment Report. The three Working Group
contributions are available from the Cambridge University Press:

in relation to climate change: the role of greenhouse gas emissions; the
severity of potential risks and impacts, especially for the least develo-

As such, the SYR calls for the urgent attention of both policymakers
and citizens of the world to tackle this challenge.

"The Synthesis Report (SYR) distils and integrates the findings of the
three Working Group contributions to the Fifth Assessment Report
(ARS) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the
most comprehensive assessment of climate change undertaken thus
far by the IPCC: Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis; Cli-
mate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability; and Clima-
te Change 2014: Mitigation of Climate Change. The SYR also incorpo-
rates the findings of two Special Reports on Renewable Energy Sources
and Climate Change Mitigation (2011) and on Managing the Risks of
Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation
(2011).
"	Text
"The SYR was made possible thanks to the voluntary work, dedication
and commitment of thousands of experts and scientists from around
the globe, representing a range of views and disciplines. We would
like to express our deep gratitude to all the members of the Core Wri-
ting Team of the SYR, members of the Extended Writing Team, and the
Review Editors, all of whom enthusiastically took on the huge chal-
lenge of producing an outstanding SYR on top of the other tasks they
had already committed to during the AR5 cycle. We would also like
to thank the staff of the Technical Support Unit of the SYR and the
IPCC Secretariat for their dedication in organizing the production of
this IPCC report.
"	Text
"The timing of the SYR, which was released on 2nd November 2014 in
Copenhagen, was crucial. Policymakers met in December 2014 in Lima
at the 20"" Conference of Parties under the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to prepare the groundwork
for the 21:* Session in 2015 in Paris, when they have been tasked with
concluding a new agreement to deal with climate change. It is our
hope that the scientific findings of the SYR will be the basis of their
motivation to find the way to a global agreement which can keep cli-
mate change to a manageable level, as the SYR gives us the knowledge
to make informed choices, and enhances our vital understanding of the
rationale for action — and the serious implications of inaction. Ignorance
can no longer be an excuse for tergiversation.
"	Text
"We also wish to acknowledge and thank the governments of the IPCC
member countries for their support of scientists in developing this
report, and for their contributions to the IPCC Trust Fund to provide
the essentials for participation of experts from developing countries
and countries with economies in transition. We would like to express
our appreciation to the government of Wallonia (Belgium) for hosting
the Scoping Meeting of the SYR, to the governments of Norway, the
Netherlands, Germany and Malaysia for hosting drafting sessions of the
SYR, and to the government of Denmark for hosting the 40th Session of
the IPCC where the SYR was approved. The generous financial support
from the governments of Norway and the Netherlands, from the Korea
Energy Economics Institute, and the in-kind support by the Netherlands
Environmental Assessment Agency and The Energy and Resources Insti-
tute, New Delhi (India), enabled the smooth operation of the Technical
Support Unit of the SYR. This is gratefully acknowledged.

"The SYR confirms that human influence on the climate system is clear
and growing, with impacts observed across all continents and oceans.
Many of the observed changes since the 1950s are unprecedented over
decades to millennia. The IPCC is now 95 percent certain that humans
are the main cause of current global warming. In addition, the SYR finds
that the more human activities disrupt the climate, the greater the risks
of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems,
and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system. The
SYR highlights that we have the means to limit climate change and
its risks, with many solutions that allow for continued economic and
human development. However, stabilizing temperature increase to
below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels will require an urgent and
fundamental departure from business as usual. Moreover, the longer we
wait to take action, the more it will cost and the greater the technologi-
cal, economic, social and institutional challenges we will face.

"The Synthesis Report (SYR), constituting the final product of the Fifth
Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC), is published under the title Climate Change 2014. This
report distils, synthesizes and integrates the key findings of the three
Working Group contributions — The Physical Science Basis, Impacts,
Adaptation, and Vulnerability and Mitigation of Climate Change — to
the ARS in a concise document for the benefit of decision makers in
the government, the private sector as well as the public at large. The
SYR also draws on the findings of the two Special Reports brought out
in 2011 dealing with Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change
Mitigation, and Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to
Advance Climate Change Adaptation. The SYR, therefore, is a compre-
hensive up-to-date compilation of assessments dealing with climate
change, based on the most recent scientific, technical and socio-economic
literature in the field.
"	Text
"Other aspects of climate change covered in this report include direct
impacts of climate change on natural systems as well as both direct
and indirect impacts on human systems, such as human health, food
security and security of societal conditions. By embedding climate
change risk and issues of adaptation and mitigation within the frame-
work of sustainable development, the SYR also highlights the fact that
nearly all systems on this planet would be affected by the impacts
of a changing climate, and that it is not possible to draw boundaries
around climate change, its associated risks and impacts on the one
hand and on the other, development which meets the needs of the
present generation without compromising the ability of future gene-
rations to meet their own needs. The Report, therefore, also focuses
on connections between these aspects and provides information on
how climate change overlaps with and mainstreams into other deve-
lopmental issues.

"The SYR of the AR5 of the IPCC has been prepared in accordance with
the procedures of the IPCC to ensure adequate effort and rigor being
achieved in the process. For the ARS the preparation of the SYR was
taken in hand a year earlier than was the case with the Fourth Assess-
ment Report (AR4) — while the Working Group Reports were still
being completed — with a view to enhancing integration and ensuring
adequate synthesis. A scoping meeting specifically for proposing the
detailed outline of the AR5 Synthesis Report was held in Liége,
Belgium in August, 2010, and the outline produced in that meeting was
approved by the Panel in October, 2010 in Busan, Republic of Korea.
In accordance with IPCC procedures, the IPCC Chair in consultation
with the Co-Chairs of the Working Groups nominated authors for the
Core Writing Team (CWT) of the SYR and a total of 45 CWT members
and 9 Review Editors were selected and accepted by the IPCC Bureau
in March, 2012. In addition, 14 Extended Writing Team (EWT) authors
were selected by the CWT with the approval of the Chair of the IPCC,
and this latter group contributed substantially to the material and the
text provided in this report. During evolution of the contents of the
SYR the IPCC Bureau was approached and it approved the inclusion
of 6 additional CWT members and an additional Review Editor.
This further enhanced and deepened the expertise required for the
preparation of the Report. The final draft report which has undergone
a combined review by experts and governments was submitted to the
40th Session of the IPCC, held from 27 October to 1 November 2014 in
Copenhagen, Denmark, where governments approved the SPM line by
line and adopted the longer report section by section.

"The Synthesis Report of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is dedicated to
the memory of Stephen H. Schneider, one of the foremost climate scientists of our time.
"	Text
"Steve Schneider, born in New York, trained as a plasma physicist, embraced scholarship in the field of climate science almost
40 years ago and continued his relentless efforts creating new knowledge in the field and informing policymakers and the public
at large on the growing problem of climate change and solutions for dealing with it. At all times Steve Schneider remained
intrepid and forthright in expressing his views. His convictions were driven by the strength of his outstanding scientific expertise.
He was highly respected as Founding Editor of the interdisciplinary journal Climatic Change and authored hundreds of books and
papers, many of which were co-authored with scientists from diverse disciplines. His association with the IPCC began with the
First Assessment Report which was published in 1990, and which played a major role in the scientific foundation of the UN Frame-
work Convention on Climate Change. Subsequently, he was Lead Author, Coordinating Lead Author and Expert Reviewer for
various Assessment Reports and a member of the Core Writing Team for the Synthesis Report of the Fourth Assessment Report.
His life and accomplishments have inspired and motivated members of the Core Writing Team of this Report. Steve Schneider's
knowledge was a rare synthesis of several disciplines which are an essential part of the diversity inherent in climate science.

reached 49 + 4.5 GtCO,-eq/yr 3. Emissions of CO, from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes contributed about 78%
of the total GHG emissions increase from 1970 to 2010, with a similar percentage contribution for the increase during the
period 2000 to 2010 (high confidence) (Figure SPM.2). Globally, economic and population growth continued to be the most
important drivers of increases in CO, emissions from fossil fuel combustion. The contribution of population growth between
2000 and 2010 remained roughly identical to the previous three decades, while the contribution of economic growth has
risen sharply. Increased use of coal has reversed the long-standing trend of gradual decarbonization (ie., reducing the carbon
intensity of energy) of the world’s energy supply (high confidence). {1.2.2}

"The evidence for human influence on the climate system has grown since the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). It is
extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was
caused by the anthropogenic increase in GHG concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together. The best estimate
of the human-induced contribution to warming is similar to the observed warming over this period (Figure SPM.3). Anthro-
pogenic forcings have /ikely made a substantial contribution to surface temperature increases since the mid-20th century
over every continental region except Antarctica*. Anthropogenic influences have likely affected the global water cycle since
1960 and contributed to the retreat of glaciers since the 1960s and to the increased surface melting of the Greenland ice
sheet since 1993. Anthropogenic influences have very likely contributed to Arctic sea-ice loss since 1979 and have very likely
made a substantial contribution to increases in global upper ocean heat content (0-700 m) and to global mean sea level rise
observed since the 1970s. {7.3, Figure 1.10}

The attributed warming ranges (colours) are based on observations combined with climate model simulations, in order to estimate the contribution of an
individual external forcing to the observed warming. The contribution from the combined anthropogenic forcings can be estimated with less uncertainty
than the contributions from greenhouse gases and from other anthropogenic forcings separately. This is because these two contributions partially compen-

changing precipitation or melting snow and ice are altering hydrological systems, affecting water resources in terms of
quantity and quality (medium confidence). Many terrestrial, freshwater and marine species have shifted their geographic
ranges, seasonal activities, migration patterns, abundances and species interactions in response to ongoing climate change
(high confidence). Some impacts on human systems have also been attributed to climate change, with a major or minor
contribution of climate change distinguishable from other influences (Figure SPM.4). Assessment of many studies covering

than positive impacts (high confidence). Some impacts of ocean acidification on marine organisms have been attributed to

air pollutant emissions and land use. The RCPs include a stringent mitigation scenario (RCP2.6), two intermediate scenarios
(RCP4.5 and RCP6.0) and one scenario with very high GHG emissions (RCP8.5). Scenarios without additional efforts to
constrain emissions (‘baseline scenarios’) lead to pathways ranging between RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 (Figure SPM.5a). RCP2.6 is

"Risk of climate-related impacts results from the interaction of climate-related hazards (including hazardous events and
trends) with the vulnerability and exposure of human and natural systems, including their ability to adapt. Rising rates and
magnitudes of warming and other changes in the climate system, accompanied by ocean acidification, increase the risk
of severe, pervasive and in some cases irreversible detrimental impacts. Some risks are particularly relevant for individual
regions (Figure SPM.8), while others are global. The overall risks of future climate change impacts can be reduced by limiting
the rate and magnitude of climate change, including ocean acidification. The precise levels of climate change sufficient to
trigger abrupt and irreversible change remain uncertain, but the risk associated with crossing such thresholds increases with
rising temperature (medium confidence). For risk assessment, it is important to evaluate the widest possible range of impacts,
including low-probability outcomes with large consequences. {7.5, 2.3, 2.4, 3.3, Box Introduction.1, Box 2.3, Box 2.4}

geographical ranges sufficiently fast to keep up with current and high projected rates of climate change in most landscapes;
most small mammals and freshwater molluscs will not be able to keep up at the rates projected under RCP4.5 and above
in flat landscapes in this century (high confidence). Future risk is indicated to be high by the observation that natural global
climate change at rates lower than current anthropogenic climate change caused significant ecosystem shifts and species
extinctions during the past millions of years. Marine organisms will face progressively lower oxygen levels and high rates and
magnitudes of ocean acidification (high confidence), with associated risks exacerbated by rising ocean temperature extremes
(medium confidence). Coral reefs and polar ecosystems are highly vulnerable. Coastal systems and low-lying areas are at

difference include that this report has assessed a substantially larger number of scenarios than in the AR4 and looks at all GHGs. In addition, a large

Limits to adaptation emerge from the interaction among climate change and biophysical and/or socio-economic constraints.
Further, poor planning or implementation, overemphasizing short-term outcomes or failing to sufficiently anticipate conse-
quences can result in maladaptation, increasing the vulnerability or exposure of the target group in the future or the vulner-
ability of other people, places or sectors (medium evidence, high agreement). Underestimating the complexity of adaptation

sustainable development (high confidence). At the national level, transformation is considered most effective when it reflects
a country’s own visions and approaches to achieving sustainable development in accordance with its national circumstances

ing transformational change, may increase costs and losses and miss opportunities. Planning and implementation of trans-
formational adaptation could reflect strengthened, altered or aligned paradigms and may place new and increased demands
on governance structures to reconcile different goals and visions for the future and to address possible equity and ethical
implications. Adaptation pathways are enhanced by iterative learning, deliberative processes and innovation. {3.3}

adapt to climate change imply an increasing complexity of interactions, particularly at the intersections among water,
energy, land use and biodiversity, but tools to understand and manage these interactions remain limited. Examples of
actions with co-benefits include (i) improved energy efficiency and cleaner energy sources, leading to reduced emissions of
health-damaging, climate-altering air pollutants; (ii) reduced energy and water consumption in urban areas through greening
cities and recycling water; (iii) sustainable agriculture and forestry; and (iv) protection of ecosystems for carbon storage and

"Well-designed systemic and cross-sectoral mitigation strategies are more cost-effective in cutting emissions than a focus
on individual technologies and sectors, with efforts in one sector affecting the need for mitigation in others (medium confi-

These intersections, if well-managed, can strengthen the basis for undertaking climate action. {4.3}

mitigation scenarios (solid colour bars) that reach about 450 (430 to 480) ppm CO,-eq concentrations in 2100 (likely to limit warming to 2°C above pre-
industrial levels). Mitigation in the end-use sectors leads also to indirect emissions reductions in the upstream energy supply sector. Direct emissions of the
end-use sectors thus do not include the emission reduction potential at the supply-side due to, for example, reduced electricity demand. The numbers at the
bottom of the graphs refer to the number of scenarios included in the range (upper row: baseline scenarios; lower row: mitigation scenarios), which differs
across sectors and time due to different sectoral resolution and time horizon of models. Emissions ranges for mitigation scenarios include the full portfolio
of mitigation options; many models cannot reach 450 ppm CO,-eq concentration by 2100 in the absence of carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS).
Negative emissions in the electricity sector are due to the application of bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage (BECCS). ‘Net’ agriculture,
forestry and other land use (AFOLU) emissions consider afforestation, reforestation as well as deforestation activities. {4.3, Figure 4. 1}

electricity generation (medium evidence, high agreement) as well as efficiency enhancements and behavioural changes, in
order to reduce energy demand compared to baseline scenarios without compromising development (robust evidence, high
agreement). In scenarios reaching 450 ppm CO,-eq concentrations by 2100, global CO, emissions from the energy supply
sector are projected to decline over the next decade and are characterized by reductions of 90% or more below 2010 levels
between 2040 and 2070. In the majority of low-concentration stabilization scenarios (about 450 to about 500 ppm CO,-eq,
at least about as likely as not to limit warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels), the share of low-carbon electricity supply
(comprising renewable energy (RE), nuclear and carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) including bioenergy with carbon
dioxide capture and storage (BECCS)) increases from the current share of approximately 30% to more than 80% by 2050,
and fossil fuel power generation without CCS is phased out almost entirely by 2100. {4.3}

"There has been a considerable increase in national and sub-national plans and strategies on both adaptation and mitigation
since the AR4, with an increased focus on policies designed to integrate multiple objectives, increase co-benefits and reduce

"Behaviour, lifestyle and culture have a considerable influence on energy use and associated emissions, with high mitigation
potential in some sectors, in particular when complementing technological and structural change (medium evidence, medium
agreement). Emissions can be substantially lowered through changes in consumption patterns, adoption of energy savings
measures, dietary change and reduction in food wastes. {4.1, 4.3}

"Near-term reductions in energy demand are an important element of cost-effective mitigation strategies, provide more
flexibility for reducing carbon intensity in the energy supply sector, hedge against related supply-side risks, avoid lock-in to
carbon-intensive infrastructures, and are associated with important co-benefits. The most cost-effective mitigation options in
forestry are afforestation, sustainable forest management and reducing deforestation, with large differences in their relative
importance across regions; and in agriculture, cropland management, grazing land management and restoration of organic
soils (medium evidence, high agreement). {4.3, Figures 4.1, 4.2, Table 4.3}

"National governments play key roles in adaptation planning and implementation (robust evidence, high agreement)

"The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is the main multilateral forum focused on
addressing climate change, with nearly universal participation. Other institutions organized at different levels of gover-

The Kyoto Protocol offers lessons towards achieving the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC, particularly with respect to
participation, implementation, flexibility mechanisms and environmental effectiveness (medium evidence, low agree-

Policy linkages among regional, national and sub-national climate policies offer potential climate change mitigation ben-

"Technology policy (development, diffusion and transfer) complements other mitigation policies across all scales, from interna-
tional to sub-national; many adaptation efforts also critically rely on diffusion and transfer of technologies and management
practices (high confidence). Policies exist to address market failures in R&D, but the effective use of technologies can also
depend on capacities to adopt technologies appropriate to local circumstances. {4.4.3}

scenarios that stabilize concentrations (without overshoot) in the range of 430 to 530 ppm CO,-eq by 2100"", annual invest-

in the scenarios to rise by several hundred billion dollars per year before 2030. Within appropriate enabling environments,
the private sector, along with the public sector, can play important roles in financing mitigation and adaptation (medium

"Co-benefits and adverse side effects of mitigation could affect achievement of other objectives such as those related to
human health, food security, biodiversity, local environmental quality, energy access, livelihoods and equitable sustainable
development. The potential for co-benefits for energy end-use measures outweighs the potential for adverse side effects
whereas the evidence suggests this may not be the case for all energy supply and agriculture, forestry and other land use
(AFOLU) measures. Some mitigation policies raise the prices for some energy services and could hamper the ability of socie-
ties to expand access to modern energy services to underserved populations (/ow confidence). These potential adverse side
effects on energy access can be avoided with the adoption of complementary policies such as income tax rebates or other
benefit transfer mechanisms (medium confidence). Whether or not side effects materialize, and to what extent side effects
materialize, will be case- and site-specific, and depend on local circumstances and the scale, scope and pace of implementa-
tion. Many co-benefits and adverse side effects have not been well-quantified. {4.3, 4.4.2.2, Box 3.4}

(e.g., insurance, public-private partnerships), laws and regulations (e.g., land-zoning laws) and national and government
policies and programmes (e.g., economic diversification). {4.2, 4.4.2.1, Table SPM.3}

In principle, mechanisms that set a carbon price, including cap and trade systems and carbon taxes, can achieve mitiga-
tion in a cost-effective way but have been implemented with diverse effects due in part to national circumstances as
well as policy design. The short-run effects of cap and trade systems have been limited as a result of loose caps or caps
that have not proved to be constraining (limited evidence, medium agreement). In some countries, tax-based policies
specifically aimed at reducing GHG emissions—alongside technology and other policies—have helped to weaken the
link between GHG emissions and GDP (high confidence). In addition, in a large group of countries, fuel taxes (although
not necessarily designed for the purpose of mitigation) have had effects that are akin to sectoral carbon taxes. {4.4.2.2}

Regulatory approaches and information measures are widely used and are often environmentally effective (medium evi-
dence, medium agreement). Examples of regulatory approaches include energy efficiency standards; examples of infor-
mation programmes include labelling programmes that can help consumers make better-informed decisions. {4.4.2.2}

Sector-specific mitigation policies have been more widely used than economy-wide policies (medium evidence, high
agreement). Sector-specific policies may be better suited to address sector-specific barriers or market failures and may be
bundled in packages of complementary policies. Although theoretically more cost-effective, administrative and political
barriers may make economy-wide policies harder to implement. Interactions between or among mitigation policies may
be synergistic or may have no additive effect on reducing emissions. {4.4.2.2}

Economic instruments in the form of subsidies may be applied across sectors, and include a variety of policy designs, such
as tax rebates or exemptions, grants, loans and credit lines. An increasing number and variety of renewable energy (RE)
policies including subsidies—motivated by many factors—have driven escalated growth of RE technologies in recent
years. At the same time, reducing subsidies for GHG-related activities in various sectors can achieve emission reductions,
depending on the social and economic context (high confidence). {4.4.2.2}

"Risks from climate change impacts arise from the interaction between hazard (triggered by an event or trend related to climate
change), vulnerability (susceptibility to harm) and exposure (people, assets or ecosystems at risk). Hazards include processes that range
from brief events, such as severe storms, to slow trends, such as multi-decade droughts or multi-century sea level rise. Vulnerability
and exposure are both sensitive to a wide range of social and economic processes, with possible increases or decreases depending
on development pathways. Risks and co-benefits also arise from policies that aim to mitigate climate change or to adapt to it. (1.5)

"Risk is often represented as the probability of occurrence of hazardous events or trends multiplied by the magnitude of the conse-
quences if these events occur. Therefore, high risk can result not only from high probability outcomes but also from low probability out-
comes with very severe consequences. This makes it important to assess the full range of possible outcomes, from low probability tail
outcomes to very likely outcomes. For example, it is unlikely that global mean sea level will rise by more than one meter in this century,
but the consequence of a greater rise could be so severe that this possibility becomes a significant part of risk assessment. Similarly,
low confidence but high consequence outcomes are also policy relevant; for instance the possibility that the response of Amazon forest
could substantially amplify climate change merits consideration despite our currently imperfect ability to project the outcome. (2.4,

"An integral feature of IPCC reports is the communication of the strength of and uncertainties in scientific understanding underlying
assessment findings. Uncertainty can result from a wide range of sources. Uncertainties in the past and present are the result of limita-
tions of available measurements, especially for rare events, and the challenges of evaluating causation in complex or multi-component
processes that can span physical, biological and human systems. For the future, climate change involves changing likelihoods of diverse
outcomes. Many processes and mechanisms are well understood, but others are not. Complex interactions among multiple climatic and
non-climatic influences changing over time lead to persistent uncertainties, which in turn lead to the possibility of surprises. Compared
to past IPCC reports, the AR5 assesses a substantially larger knowledge base of scientific, technical and socio-economic literature.

"The IPCC Guidance Note on Uncertainty? defines a common approach to evaluating and communicating the degree of certainty in
findings of the assessment process. Each finding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement. In many cases, a
synthesis of evidence and agreement supports an assignment of confidence, especially for findings with stronger agreement and mul-
tiple independent lines of evidence. The degree of certainty in each key finding of the assessment is based on the type, amount, quality
and consistency of evidence (e.g., data, mechanistic understanding, theory, models, expert judgment) and the degree of agreement.
The summary terms for evidence are: limited, medium or robust. For agreement, they are low, medium or high. Levels of confidence
include five qualifiers: very low, low, medium, high and very high, and are typeset in italics, e.g., medium confidence. The likelihood, or
probability, of some well-defined outcome having occurred or occurring in the future can be described quantitatively through the follo-
wing terms: virtually certain, 99-100% probability; extremely likely, 95-100%; very likely, 90-100%; likely, 66—100%; more likely than
not, >50-100%; about as likely as not, 33-66%; unlikely, 0-33%; very unlikely, O-10%; extremely unlikely, 0-5%; and exceptionally
unlikely, 0-1%. Additional terms (extremely likely, 95—100%; more likely than not, >50—-100%; more unlikely than likely, 0-<50%;
and extremely unlikely, 0-5%) may also be used when appropriate. Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics, e.g., very likely. Unless
otherwise indicated, findings assigned a likelihood term are associated with high or very high confidence. Where appropriate, findings
are also formulated as statements of fact without using uncertainty qualifiers. {WG/ SPM B, WGII Background Box SPM.3, WGIll 2.1}

21 The connection between the heat budget and equilibrium climate sensitivity, which is the long-term surface warming under an assumed doubling of the atmospheric
CO, concentration, arises because a warmer surface causes enhanced radiation to space which counteracts the increase in the Earth’s heat content. How much the
radiation to space increases for a given increase in surface temperature depends on the same feedback processes (e.g., cloud feedback, water vapour feedback) that
determine equilibrium climate sensitivity.

(in °C per decade) occurs among the 114 simulations. The width of the red-hatched area indicates the statistical uncertainty that arises from constructing a global average
from individual station data. This observational uncertainty differs from the one quoted in the text of Section 1.1.1; there, an estimate of natural internal variability is also

"The radiative forcing of the climate system has continued to increase during the 2000s, as has its largest contributor, the atmospheric
concentration of CO,. However, the radiative forcing has been increasing at a lower rate over the period from 1998 to 2011, compared to
1984 to 1998 or 1951 to 2011, due to cooling effects from volcanic eruptions and the cooling phase of the solar cycle over the period from
2000 to 2009. There is, however, low confidence in quantifying the role of the forcing trend in causing the reduction in the rate of surface
warming. {WGI 8.5.2, Box 9.2}
"	Text
"The observed reduction in surface warming trend over the period 1998 to 2012 as compared to the period 1951 to 2012,
is due in roughly equal measure to a reduced trend in radiative forcing and a cooling contribution from natural internal
variability, which includes a possible redistribution of heat within the ocean (medium confidence). The rate of warming of the
observed global mean surface temperature over the period from 1998 to 2012 is estimated to be around one-third to one-half of the trend
over the period from 1951 to 2012 (Box 1.1, Figures 1a and 1c). Even with this reduction in surface warming trend, the climate system has
very likely continued to accumulate heat since 1998 (Figure 1.2) and sea level has continued to rise (Figure 1.1). {WG/ SPM D.1, Box 9.2}
"	Text
"For the longer period from 1951 to 2012, simulated surface warming trends are consistent with the observed trend (very high confidence)
(Box 1.1, Figure 1c). Furthermore, the independent estimates of radiative forcing, of surface warming and of observed heat storage (the
latter available since 1970) combine to give a heat budget for the Earth that is consistent with the assessed likely range of equilibrium
climate sensitivity (1.5—4.5 °C)?"". The record of observed climate change has thus allowed characterization of the basic properties of the
climate system that have implications for future warming, including the equilibrium climate sensitivity and the transient climate response
(see Topic 2). {WGI Box 9.2, 10.8.1, 10.8.2, Box 12.2, Box 13.1}

"For the period from 1998 to 2012, 111 of the 114 available climate-model simulations show a surface warming trend larger than the
observations (Box 1.1, Figure 1a). There is medium confidence that this difference between models and observations is to a substantial
degree caused by natural internal climate variability, which sometimes enhances and sometimes counteracts the long-term externally
forced warming trend (compare Box 1.1, Figures 1a and 1b; during the period from 1984 to 1998, most model simulations show a smaller
warming trend than observed). Natural internal variability thus diminishes the relevance of short trends for long-term climate change. The
difference between models and observations may also contain contributions from inadequacies in the solar, volcanic and aerosol forcings
used by the models and, in some models, from an overestimate of the response to increasing greenhouse gas and other anthropogenic
forcing (the latter dominated by the effects of aerosols). {WG/ 2.4.3, Box 9.2, 9.4.1, 10.3.1.1}

a cooling. Radiative forcing is estimated based on in-situ and remote
observations, properties of GHGs and aerosols, and calculations using
numerical models. The radiative forcing over the 1750-2011 period is
shown in Figure 1.4 in major groupings. The ‘Other Anthropogenic’

"Figure 1.6 | Total annual anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (gigatonne of CO,-equivalent per year, GtCO,-eq/yr) for the period 1970 to 2010, by gases: CO, from
fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes; CO, from Forestry and Other Land Use (FOLU); methane (CH,); nitrous oxide (N,0); fluorinated gases covered under the Kyoto
Protocol (F-gases). Right hand side shows 2010 emissions, using alternatively CO,-equivalent emission weightings based on IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR) and ARS values.
Unless otherwise stated, CO,-equivalent emissions in this report include the basket of Kyoto gases (CO,, CH,, N,O as well as F-gases) calculated based on 100-year Global Warming
Potential (GWP,,9) values from the SAR (see Glossary). Using the most recent GWP 99 values from the ARS (right-hand bars) would result in higher total annual GHG emissions
(52 GtCO,-eq/yr) from an increased contribution of methane, but does not change the long-term trend significantly. Other metric choices would change the contributions of different
gases (see Box 3.2). The 2010 values are shown again broken down into their components with the associated uncertainties (90% confidence interval) indicated by the error bars.
Global CO, emissions from fossil fuel combustion are known with an 8% uncertainty margin (90% confidence interval). There are very large uncertainties (of the order of +50%)
attached to the CO, emissions from FOLU. Uncertainty about the global emissions of CH,, N,O and the F-gases has been estimated at 20%, 60% and 20%, respectively. 2010
was the most recent year for which emission statistics on all gases as well as assessments of uncertainties were essentially complete at the time of data cut off for this report. The
uncertainty estimates only account for uncertainty in emissions, not in the GWPs (as given in WGI 8.7). {WGIll Figure SPM. 1}

"The Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) describe four different 21st century pathways of greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions and atmospheric concentrations, air pollutant emissions and land use. The RCPs have been developed using
Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) as input to a wide range of climate model simulations to project their consequences for the cli-
mate system. These climate projections, in turn, are used for impacts and adaptation assessment. The RCPs are consistent with the wide
range of scenarios in the mitigation literature assessed by WGIlI?8. The scenarios are used to assess the costs associated with emission
reductions consistent with particular concentration pathways. The RCPs represent the range of GHG emissions in the wider literature
well (Box 2.2, Figure 1); they include a stringent mitigation scenario (RCP2.6), two intermediate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP6.0), and
one scenario with very high GHG emissions (RCP8.5). Scenarios without additional efforts to constrain emissions (‘baseline scenarios’)
lead to pathways ranging between RCP6.0 and RCP8.5. RCP2.6 is representative of a scenario that aims to keep global warming /ikely
below 2°C above pre-industrial temperatures. The majority of models indicate that scenarios meeting forcing levels similar to RCP2.6
are characterized by substantial net negative emissions’? by 2100, on average around 2 GtCO,/yr. The land use scenarios of RCPs,
together, show a wide range of possible futures, ranging from a net reforestation to further deforestation, consistent with projections in
the full scenario literature. For air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO,), the RCP scenarios assume a consistent decrease in emissions
as a consequence of assumed air pollution control and GHG mitigation policy (Box 2.2, Figure 1). Importantly, these future scenarios
do not account for possible changes in natural forcings (e.g., volcanic eruptions) (see Box 1.1). {WG/ Box SPM.1, 6.4, 8.5.3, 12.3,

"Future climate-related risks, vulnerabilities and impacts are estimated in the AR5 through experiments, analogies and
models, as in previous assessments. ‘Experiments’ involve deliberately changing one or more climate-system factors affecting a
subject of interest to reflect anticipated future conditions, while holding the other factors affecting the subject constant. ‘Analogies’
make use of existing variations and are used when controlled experiments are impractical due to ethical constraints, the large area or
long time required or high system complexity. Two types of analogies are used in projections of climate and impacts. Spatial analo-
gies identify another part of the world currently experiencing similar conditions to those anticipated to be experienced in the future.
Temporal analogies use changes in the past, sometimes inferred from paleo-ecological data, to make inferences about changes in the

"Key risks are potentially severe impacts relevant to understanding dan-

considered key due to high hazard or high vulnerability of societies and
systems exposed, or both. Their identification is based on large magni-
tude or high probability of impacts; irreversibility or timing of impacts;
persistent vulnerability or exposure; or limited potential to reduce risks.
Some risks are particularly relevant for individual regions (Figure 2.4),
while others are global (Table 2.3). For risk assessment it is important to
evaluate the widest possible range of impacts, including low-probability
outcomes with large consequences. Risk levels often increase with
temperature (Box 2.4) and are sometimes more directly linked to other
dimensions of climate change, such as the rate of warming, as well
as the magnitudes and rates of ocean acidification and sea level rise

"Figure 2.5 | The risks of: (a) disruption of the community composition of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems due to the rate of warming; (b) marine organisms impacted by ocean acidification (OA) or warming extremes combined with
OA; and (c) coastal human and natural systems impacted by sea level rise. The risk level criteria are consistent with those used in Box 2.4 and their calibration is illustrated by the annotations to each panel. (a) At high rates of warming, majo
groups of terrestrial and freshwater species are unable to move fast enough to stay within the spatially shifting climate envelopes to which they are adapted. The median observed or modelled speeds at which species populations move (km
decade) are compared against the speed at which climate envelopes move across the landscape, given the projected climate change rates for each Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) over the 2050-2090 period. The results are
presented for the average of all landscapes, globally, as well as for flat landscapes, where the climate envelope moves especially fast. (b) Sensitivity to ocean acidification is high in marine organisms building a calcium carbonate shell. The
risks from OA increase with warming because OA lowers the tolerated levels of heat exposure, as seen in corals and crustaceans. (c) The height of a 50-year flood event has already increased in many coastal locations. A 10- to more thar
100-fold increase in the frequency of floods in many places would result from a 0.5 m rise in sea level in the absence of adaptation. Local adaptation capacity (and, in particular, protection) reaches its limits for ecosystems and human system
in many places under a 1 m sea level rise. (2.2.4, Table 2.1, Figure 2.8) (WGI 3.7.5, 3.8, 6.4.4, Figure 13.25, WGIl Figure SPM.5, Figure 4-5, Figure 6-10, Box CC-OA, 4.4.2.5, 5.2, 5.3-5.5, 5.4.4, 5.5.6, 6.3}

Urban risks associated with

{WGIl 8.3}

* Poor quality, inappropriately located housing is often most vulnerable to
extreme events. Adaptation options include enforcement of building regulations
and upgrading. Some city studies show the potential to adapt housing and
promote mitigation, adaptation and development goals simultaneously. Rapidly
growing cities, or those rebuilding after a disaster, especially have opportunities
to increase resilience, but this is rarely realised. Without adaptation, risks of
economic losses from extreme events are substantial in cities with high-value
infrastructure and housing assets, with broader economic effects possible.

often be adjusted as new information and understanding devel-

choices in the near term will affect the risks of climate change through-

pathways for sustainable development depend on what is achieved
through mitigation. Opportunities to take advantage of positive syn-
ergies between adaptation and mitigation may decrease with time,
particularly if mitigation is delayed too long. Decision-making about
climate change is influenced by how individuals and organizations per-
ceive risks and uncertainties and take them into account. They some-
times use simplified decision rules, overestimate or underestimate risks
and are biased towards the status quo. They differ in their degree of
risk aversion and the relative importance placed on near-term versus

ity of irreversible impacts from climate change increase the
benefits of near-term mitigation efforts (high confidence). The
actions taken today affect the options available in the future to reduce
emissions, limit temperature change and adapt to climate change.
Near-term choices can create, amplify or limit significant elements of
lock-in that are important for decision-making. Lock-ins and irrevers-
ibilities occur in the climate system due to large inertia in some of its
components such as heat transfer from the ocean surface to depth
leading to continued ocean warming for centuries regardless of emis-
sion scenario and the irreversibility of a large fraction of anthropogenic
climate change resulting from CO, emissions on a multi-century to mil-
lennial timescale unless CO, were to be removed from the atmosphere
through large-scale human interventions over a sustained period (see
also Box 3.3). Irreversibilities in socio-economic and biological systems
also result from infrastructure development and long-lived products
and from climate change impacts, such as species extinction. The
larger potential for irreversibility and pervasive impacts from climate
change risks than from mitigation risks increases the benefit of short-
term mitigation efforts. Delays in additional mitigation or constraints
on technological options limit the mitigation options and increase the
long-term mitigation costs as well as other risks that would be incurred
in the medium to long term to hold climate change impacts at a given
level (Table WGIII SPM.2, blue segment). {WG/ SPM E-8, WGIl SPM B-2,

"A subset of climate change risks and impacts are often measured using aggregate economic indicators, such as gross
domestic product (GDP) or aggregate income. Estimates, however, are partial and affected by important conceptual and
empirical limitations. These incomplete estimates of global annual economic losses for temperature increases of ~2.5°C above
pre-industrial levels are between 0.2 and 2.0% of income (medium evidence, medium agreement). Losses are more likely than not to
be greater, rather than smaller, than this range (limited evidence, high agreement). Estimates of the incremental aggregate economic
impact of emitting one more tonne of carbon dioxide (the social cost of carbon) are derived from these studies and lie between a few
dollars and several hundreds of dollars per tonne of carbon in 2000 to 2015 (robust evidence, medium agreement). These impact esti-
mates are incomplete and depend on a large number of assumptions, many of which are disputable. Many estimates do not account
for the possibility of large-scale singular events and irreversibility, tipping points and other important factors, especially those that are
difficult to monetize, such as loss of biodiversity. Estimates of aggregate costs mask significant differences in impacts across sectors,
regions, countries and communities, and they therefore depend on ethical considerations, especially on the aggregation of losses across
and within countries (high confidence). Estimates of global aggregate economic losses exist only for limited warming levels. These
levels are exceeded in scenarios for the 21st century unless additional mitigation action is implemented, leading to additional economic
costs. The total economic effects at different temperature levels would include mitigation costs, co-benefits of mitigation, adverse side
effects of mitigation, adaptation costs and climate damages. As a result, mitigation cost and climate damage estimates at any given
temperature level cannot be compared to evaluate the costs and benefits of mitigation. Very little is known about the economic cost
of warming above 3°C relative to the current temperature level. Accurately estimating climate change risks (and thus the benefits of
mitigation) takes into account the full range of possible impacts of climate change, including those with high consequences but a low
probability of occurrence. The benefits of mitigation may otherwise be underestimated (high confidence). Some limitations of current
estimates may be unavoidable, even with more knowledge, such as issues with aggregating impacts over time and across individuals
when values are heterogeneous. In view of these limitations, it is outside the scope of science to identify a single best climate change
target and climate policy (3.1, 3.4). {WGIl SPM B-2, 10.9.2, 10.9.4, 13.2, 17.2-17.3, 18.4, 19.6, WGIll 3.6}

and limited tools to monitor adaptation effectiveness. Other con-

Limits to adaptation occur when adaptive actions to avoid intolera-
ble risks for an actor's objectives or for the needs of a system are not
possible or are not currently available. Value-based judgments of what
constitutes an intolerable risk may differ. Limits to adaptation emerge
from the interaction among climate change and biophysical and/or
socio-economic constraints. Opportunities to take advantage of positive
synergies between adaptation and mitigation may decrease with time,
particularly if limits to adaptation are exceeded. In some parts of the
world, insufficient responses to emerging impacts are already eroding
the basis for sustainable development. For most regions and sectors,
empirical evidence is not sufficient to quantify magnitudes of climate
change that would constitute a future adaptation limit. Furthermore,
economic development, technology and cultural norms and values can
change over time to enhance or reduce the capacity of systems to avoid
limits. As a consequence, some limits are ‘soft’ in that they may be alle-
viated over time. Other limits are ‘hard’ in that there are no reasonable
prospects for avoiding intolerable risks. {WGIl SPM C-2, TS}

"Transformations in economic, social, technological and political
decisions and actions can enhance adaptation and promote sus-
tainable development (high confidence). Restricting adaptation
responses to incremental changes to existing systems and structures
without considering transformational change may increase costs and
losses and miss opportunities. For example, enhancing infrastructure to
protect other built assets can be expensive and ultimately not defray
increasing costs and risks, whereas options such as relocation or using
ecosystem services to adapt may provide a range of benefits now and
in the future. Transformational adaptation can include introduction of
new technologies or practices, formation of new financial structures
or systems of governance, adaptation at greater scales or magnitudes
and shifts in the location of activities. Planning and implementation
of transformational adaptation could reflect strengthened, altered or
aligned paradigms and consequently may place new and increased
demands on governance structures to reconcile different goals and

For a discussion on CO2-equivalent (CO2-eq) emissions and concentrations, see Box 3.2 on GHG metrics and mitigation pathways and the Glossary.

The range quoted here is based on the warming results of a simple climate model for the emissions of around 300 baseline scenarios, expressed compared to the 1850-190
period. The warming results quoted in Section 2.2 are obtained by prescribing future concentrations of GHG in CMIP5 Earth System Models. This results in a mean warming o
1.0°C (5th to 95th percentile range: 0.3°C to 1.7°C) for RCP2.6, and a mean warming of 3.7°C (2.6°C to 4.8°C) for RCP8.5 relative to the period 1986-2005. For the sam
concentration-driven experiments, the simple climate model approach gives consistent results. The median warming is 0.9°C (0.5°C to 1.6°C) for RCP2.6 and 3.7°C (2.5%
to 5.9°C) for RCP8.5 relative to the period 1986-2005. However, the high-end of the CMIP5 ESMs range is more constrained. In addition, the baseline temperature increas
quoted here is wider than that of the concentration-driven RCP8.5 experiments mentioned above as it is based on a wider set of scenarios, includes carbon cycle respons
uncertainty, and uses a different base year (2.2, 3.4).

In concentration ‘overshoot’ scenarios, concentrations peak during the century and then decline.

CDR methods have biogeochemical and technological limitations to their potential on the global scale. There is insufficient knowledge to quantify how much CO2 emission
could be partially offset by CDR on a century timescale. CDR methods may carry side effects and long-term consequences on a global scale.

"Reducing emissions of non-CO, climate forcing agents can be
an important element of mitigation strategies. Emissions of non-
CO, gases (methane (CH,), nitrous oxide (N,O), and fluorinated gases)
contributed about 27% to the total emissions of Kyoto gases in 2010.
For most non-CO, gases, near-term, low-cost options are available to
reduce their emissions. However, some sources of these non-CO, gases
are difficult to mitigate, such as N,O emissions from fertilizer use and
CH, emissions from livestock. As a result, emissions of most non-CO,
gases will not be reduced to zero, even under stringent mitigation
scenarios (see Figure 4.1). The differences in radiative properties and
lifetimes of CO, and non-CO, climate forcing agents have important
implications for mitigation strategies (see also Box 3.2). {WGIll 6.3.2}

scenarios in the Scenario Database for WGIll ARS. Annual rates of historical emission changes (sustained over a period of 20 years) are shown as well. The arrows in the right panel
show the magnitude of zero and low-carbon energy supply upscaling from between 2030 and 2050, subject to different 2030 GHG emission levels. Zero- and low-carbon energy
supply includes renewable energy, nuclear energy and fossil energy with carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) or bioenergy with CCS (BECCS). Only scenarios that apply
the full, unconstrained mitigation technology portfolio of the underlying models (default technology assumption) are shown. Scenarios with large net negative global emissions

the degree to which metrics incorporate economic or only physical considerations. There are significant uncertainties related to metrics,

comparing components with differing physical properties using a single metric. The 100-year GWP (GWP,9,) was adopted by the United

components, particularly short-lived climate forcing agents (Box 3.2, Figure 1b). A fixed time independent metric that gives less weight
to short-lived agents such as CH, (e.g., Using GTPjo instead of GWP,,,) would require earlier and more stringent CO, abatement to

"The weight assigned to non-CO, climate forcing agents relative to CO, depends strongly on the choice of metric and time

no weight on temperature response before or after the chosen point in time. Adoption of a fixed horizon of, for example, 20, 100 or
500 years for these metrics will inevitably put no weight on climate outcomes beyond the time horizon, which is significant for CO,
as well as other long-lived gases. The choice of time horizon markedly affects the weighting especially of short-lived climate forcing

Possible Roles, Options, Risks and Status
"	Title
"Geoengineering refers to a broad set of methods and technologies operating on a large scale that aim to deliberately alter the climate
system in order to alleviate the impacts of climate change. Most methods seek to either reduce the amount of absorbed solar energy
in the climate system (Solar Radiation Management, SRM) or increase the removal of carbon dioxide (CO,) from the atmosphere by
sinks to alter climate (Carbon Dioxide Removal, CDR, see Glossary). Limited evidence precludes a comprehensive assessment of feasi-
bility, cost, side effects and environmental impacts of either CDR or SRM. {WG/ SPM E.8, 6.5, 7.7, WGII 6.4, Table 6-5, Box 20-4, WGIll

"CDR plays a major role in many mitigation scenarios. Bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage (BECCS) and afforesta-
tion are the only CDR methods included in these scenarios. CDR technologies are particularly important in scenarios that temporarily
overshoot atmospheric concentrations, but they are also prevalent in many scenarios without overshoot to compensate for residual
emissions from sectors where mitigation is more expensive. Similar to mitigation, CDR would need to be deployed on a large scale
and over a long time period to be able to significantly reduce CO, concentrations (see Section 3.1). {WGIl 6.4, WGIII SPM 4.1, TS.3.1.2,

TS 3.1.3, 6.3, 6.9}
"	Text
"SRM is untested, and is not included in any of the mitigation scenarios, but, if realisable, could to some degree offset
global temperature rise and some of its effects. It could possibly provide rapid cooling in comparison to CO, mitigation.
There is medium confidence that SRM through stratospheric aerosol injection is scalable to counter radiative forcing from a twofold
increase in CO, concentrations and some of the climate responses associated with warming. Due to insufficient understanding there is
no consensus on whether a similarly large negative counter radiative forcing could be achieved from cloud brightening. Land albedo
change does not appear to be able to produce a large counter radiative forcing. Even if SRM could counter the global mean warming,
differences in spatial patterns would remain. The scarcity of literature on other SRM techniques precludes their assessment. {W/G/ 7.7,
WGIII TS.3.1.3, 6.9}
"	Text
"If it were deployed, SRM would entail numerous uncertainties, side effects, risks and shortcomings. Several lines of evidence
indicate that SRM would itself produce a small but significant decrease in global precipitation (with larger differences on regional
scales). Stratospheric aerosol SRM is likely to modestly increase ozone losses in the polar stratosphere. SRM would not prevent the CO,
effects on ecosystems and ocean acidification that are unrelated to warming. There could also be other unanticipated consequences.
For all future scenarios considered in AR5, SRM would need to increase commensurately, to counter the global mean warming, which
would exacerbate side effects. Additionally, if SRM were increased to substantial levels and then terminated, there is high confidence
that surface temperatures would rise very rapidly (within a decade or two). This would stress systems that are sensitive to the rate of
warming. {WGI 7.67.7, FAQ 7.3, WGII 19.5, WGIII 6.9}
"	Text
"SRM technologies raise questions about costs, risks, governance and ethical implications of development and deploy-
ment. There are special challenges emerging for international institutions and mechanisms that could coordinate research
and possibly restrain testing and deployment. Even if SRM would reduce human-made global temperature increase, it would
imply spatial and temporal redistributions of risks. SRM thus introduces important questions of intragenerational and intergenerational

potential costs of some SRM deployment technologies, they will not necessarily pass a benefit-cost test that takes account of the range

"Several CDR techniques could potentially reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) levels. However, there are biogeo-
chemical, technical and societal limitations that, to varying degrees, make it difficult to provide quantitative estimates
of the potential for CDR. The emission mitigation from CDR is less than the removed CO,, as some CO, is released from that previ-
ously stored in oceans and terrestrial carbon reservoirs. Sub-sea geologic storage has been implemented on a regional scale, with no
evidence to date of ocean impact from leakage. The climatic and environmental side effects of CDR depend on technology and scale.
Examples are associated with altered surface reflectance from afforestation and ocean de-oxygenation from ocean fertilization. Most
terrestrial CDR techniques would involve competing demands for land and could involve local and regional risks, while maritime CDR
techniques may involve significant risks for ocean ecosystems, so that their deployment could pose additional challenges for coopera-

"Co-benefits of mitigation could affect achievement of other objectives, such as those related to energy security, air qual-
ity, efforts to address ecosystem impacts, income distribution, labour supply and employment and urban sprawl (see
Table 4.2 and Table 4.5). In the absence of complementary policies, however, some mitigation measures may have adverse side
effects (at least in the short term), for example on biodiversity, food security, energy access, economic growth and income distribu-
tion. The co-benefits of adaptation policies may include improved access to infrastructure and services, extended education and health
systems, reduced disaster losses, better governance and others. {WGIl 4.4.4, 11.9, 15.2, 17.2, 20.3.3, 20.4.1, WGIIl Box TS.11, 6.6}

"A government policy or a measure intended to achieve one objective often affects other objectives, either positively or
negatively. For example, mitigation policies can influence local air quality (see Figure 3.5). When the effects are positive they are
called ‘co-benefits’, also referred to as ‘ancillary benefits’. Negative effects are referred to as ‘adverse side effects’. Some measures
are labelled ‘no or low regret’ when their co-benefits are sufficient to justify their implementation, even in the absence of immediate
direct benefits. Co-benefits and adverse side effects can be measured in monetary or non-monetary units. The effect of co-benefits and
adverse side effects from climate policies on overall social welfare has not yet been quantitatively examined, with the exception of a
few recent multi-objective studies. Many of these have not been well quantified, and effects can be case and site-specific as they will
depend on local circumstances. {WGI/ 11.9, 16.3.1, 17.2, 20.4.1, WGIII Box TS.11, 3.6, 5.7}

"Comprehensive strategies in response to climate change that are consistent with sustainable development take into
account the co-benefits, adverse side effects and risks that may arise from both adaptation and mitigation options. The
assessment of overall social welfare impacts is complicated by this interaction between climate change response options and pre-
existing non-climate policies. For example, in terms of air quality, the value of the extra tonne of sulfur dioxide (SO,) reduction that
occurs with climate change mitigation through reduced fossil fuel combustion depends greatly on the stringency of SO, control policies.
If SO, policy is weak, the value of SO, reductions may be large, but if SO, policy is stringent, it may be near zero. Similarly, in terms of
adaptation and disaster risk management, weak policies can lead to an adaptation deficit that increases human and economic losses
from natural climate variability. ‘Adaptation deficit’ refers to the lack of capacity to manage adverse impacts of current climate vari-
ability. An existing adaptation deficit increases the benefits of adaptation policies that improve the management of climate variability
and change. {WGi/ 20.4.1, WGIII Box TS.11, 6.3}

"For many regions and sectors, enhanced capacities to mitigate
and adapt are part of the foundation essential for manag-
ing climate change risks (high confidence). Such capacities are
place- and context-specific and therefore there is no single approach
for reducing risk that is appropriate across all settings. For example,
developing nations with low income levels have the lowest finan-
cial, technological and institutional capacities to pursue low-carbon,
climate-resilient development pathways. Although developed
nations generally have greater relative capacity to manage the
risks of climate change, such capacity does not necessarily trans-
late into the implementation of adaptation and mitigation options.

Reduce national, institutional and individual perceptions of
the risks posed by climate change as well as the costs and
benefits of different adaptation options (WGI 16.3.2. 1}

Reduce national, institutional and individual risk perception,
willingness to change behavioural patterns and practices and to
adopt social and technological innovations to reduce emissions

Reduces the capacity of developed and, particularly, developing
nations to pursue policies and technologies that reduce emissi-
ons. {WGIll 75.4.3, 12.6.2, 16.2.2.2}

Reduces the range of available adaptation options as well as
their effectiveness in reducing or avoiding risk from increasing
rates or magnitudes of climate change {WGII 16.3.2.1}

Slows the rate at which society can reduce the carbon intensity of
energy services and transition toward low-carbon and carbon-neutral
technologies {WGlll T5.3.1.3, 4.3.6, 6.3.2.2, 11.8.4}

factors and potential competition for resources that enhances
vulnerability {WGII 16.3.2.3}

Reduce the long-term sustainability of different energy

Fisheries and some aquaculture industries with high-technology

greater development of environmental monitoring, modelling and
resource assessments. Adaptation options include large-scale translo-
cation of industrial fishing activities and flexible management that can
react to variability and change. For smaller-scale fisheries and nations
with limited adaptive capacities, building social resilience, alternative

diversity, assisted species migration and dispersal, manipulation
of disturbance regimes (e.g., fires, floods) and reduction of other

reduction measures for health in the near term are programmes that

Region Example of actions

Africa Most national governments are initiating governance systems for adaptation. Disaster risk management, adjustments in technologies and infrastructure,
ecosystem-based approaches, basic public health measures and livelihood diversification are reducing vulnerability, although efforts to date tend to be
isolated.

Europe Adaptation policy has been developed across all levels of government, with some adaptation planning integrated into coastal and water management,
into environmental protection and land planning and into disaster risk management.

Asia Adaptation is being facilitated in some areas through mainstreaming climate adaptation action into sub-national development planning, early warning
systems, integrated water resources management, agroforestry and coastal reforestation of mangroves.

Australasia Planning for sea level rise, and in southern Australia for reduced water availability, is becoming adopted widely. Planning for sea level rise has evolved

considerably over the past two decades and shows a diversity of approaches, although its implementation remains piecemeal.

 

North America

Governments are engaging in incremental adaptation assessment and planning, particularly at the municipal level. Some proactive adaptation is
occurring to protect longer-term investments in energy and public infrastructure.

 

 

 

 

 

Central and Ecosystem-based adaptation including protected areas, conservation agreements and community management of natural areas is occurring. Resilient

South America crop varieties, climate forecasts and integrated water resources management are being adopted within the agricultural sector in some areas.

The Arctic Some communities have begun to deploy adaptive co-management strategies and communications infrastructure, combining traditional and scientific
knowledge.

Small Islands Small islands have diverse physical and human attributes; community-based adaptation has been shown to generate larger benefits when delivered in
conjunction with other development activities.

The Ocean International cooperation and marine spatial planning are starting to facilitate adaptation to climate change, with constraints from challenges of spatial

 

scale and governance issues.

number of planned adaptation responses at the local level in rural and
urban communities of developed and developing countries since the

complexity of adaptation without adequate access to guiding infor-

"In principle, mechanisms that set a carbon price, including cap
and trade systems and carbon taxes, can achieve mitigation in
a cost-effective way, but have been implemented with diverse
effects due in part to national circumstances as well as policy
design. The short-run environmental effects of cap and trade sys-
tems have been limited as a result of loose caps or caps that have not
proved to be constraining (limited evidence, medium agreement). In
some countries, tax-based policies specifically aimed at reducing GHG
emissions—alongside technology and other policies—have helped to
weaken the link between GHG emissions and gross domestic product
(GDP) (high confidence). In addition, in a large group of countries, fuel
taxes (although not necessarily designed for the purpose of mitigation)
have had effects that are akin to sectoral carbon taxes (robust evi-
dence, medium agreement). Revenues from carbon taxes or auctioned
emission allowances are used in some countries to reduce other taxes
and/or to provide transfers to low-income groups. This illustrates the
general principle that mitigation policies that raise government reve-
nue generally have lower social costs than approaches which do not.

in countries with national policies and in those without. These
policies include state and provincial climate plans combining market,

have an additive environmental effect to policies such as subsidies for

stringent cap to affect emission-related decisions, then other policies
have no further impact on reducing emissions (although they may
affect costs and possibly the viability of more stringent future targets)

literature based on economy-wide models has projected that com-
plete removal of subsidies to fossil fuels in all countries could result
in reductions in global aggregate emissions by mid-century (medium

and definition of subsidies and the time frame for phase out consid-

of all fossil fuel subsides without seeking to assess which subsidies

technology-push (e.g., publicly-funded R&D) and demand-pull (e.g.,
governmental procurement programmes). Such policies address
a pervasive market failure because, in the absence of government
policy such as patent protection, the invention of new technologies
and practices from R&D efforts has aspects of a public good and
thus tends to be under-provided by market forces alone. Technology
support policies have promoted substantial innovation and diffusion
of new technologies, but the cost-effectiveness of such policies is
often difficult to assess. Technology policy can increase incentives for

capture of CO, from the atmosphere using engineered chemical means.
Some CDR methods fall under the category of geoengineering, though
this may not be the case for others, with the distinction being based on
the magnitude, scale and impact of the particular CDR activities. The
boundary between CDR and mitigation is not clear and there could be
some overlap between the two given current definitions (IPCC, 2012b,

"scenarios refers to scenarios that are based on the assumption that no
mitigation policies or measures will be implemented beyond those that
are already in force and/or are legislated or planned to be adopted.
Baseline scenarios are not intended to be predictions of the future,
but rather counterfactual constructions that can serve to highlight the
level of emissions that would occur without further policy effort. Typ-
ically, baseline scenarios are then compared to mitigation scenarios
that are constructed to meet different goals for greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions, atmospheric concentrations or temperature change. The
term baseline scenario is used interchangeably with reference scenario
and no policy scenario. In much of the literature the term is also synon-
ymous with the term business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, although the
term BAU has fallen out of favour because the idea of business as
usual in century-long socio-economic projections is hard to fathom.

A climate projection is the simulated response of the climate system
to a scenario of future emission or concentration of greenhouse gases
(GHGs) and aerosols, generally derived using climate models. Climate
projections are distinguished from climate predictions by their depend-
ence on the emission/concentration/radiative forcing scenario used,
which is in turn based on assumptions concerning, for example, future
socio-economic and technological developments that may or may not
be realized. {WGI, II, Ill}

"An interaction in which a perturbation in one climate quantity causes
a change in a second and the change in the second quantity ultimately
leads to an additional change in the first. A negative feedback is one in
which the initial perturbation is weakened by the changes it causes; a
positive feedback is one in which the initial perturbation is enhanced.
In the Fifth Assessment Report, a somewhat narrower definition is
often used in which the climate quantity that is perturbed is the global
mean surface temperature, which in turn causes changes in the global
radiation budget. In either case, the initial perturbation can either be
externally forced or arise as part of internal variability. {WGI, II, III}

Climate change refers to a change in the state of the climate that can
be identified (e.g., by using statistical tests) by changes in the mean
and/or the variability of its properties and that persists for an extended
period, typically decades or longer. Climate change may be due to nat-
ural internal processes or external forcings such as modulations of the
solar cycles, volcanic eruptions and persistent anthropogenic changes
in the composition of the atmosphere or in /and use. Note that the
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in its Article 1,
defines climate change as: ‘a change of climate which is attributed
directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of
the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate varia-
bility observed over comparable time periods’. The UNFCCC thus makes
a distinction between climate change attributable to human activities
altering the atmospheric composition and climate variability attributa-
ble to natural causes. See also Detection and Attribution. {WGI, Il, Ill}

A numerical representation of the climate system based on the phys-

actions and feedback processes and accounting for some of its known
properties. The climate system can be represented by models of varying
complexity; that is, for any one component or combination of compo-
nents a spectrum or hierarchy of models can be identified, differing in
such aspects as the number of spatial dimensions, the extent to which
physical, chemical or biological processes are explicitly represented, or
the level at which empirical parametrizations are involved. Coupled
Atmosphere—Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) provide a
representation of the climate system that is near or at the most com-
prehensive end of the spectrum currently available. There is an evo-
lution towards more complex models with interactive chemistry and
biology. Climate models are applied as a research tool to study and
simulate the climate and for operational purposes, including monthly,
seasonal and interannual climate predictions. {WGi, II, Ill}

The term E/ Nifio was initially used to describe a warm-water current
that periodically flows along the coast of Ecuador and Peru, disrupt-
ing the local fishery. It has since become identified with a basin-wide
warming of the tropical Pacific Ocean east of the dateline. This oceanic
event is associated with a fluctuation of a global-scale tropical and
subtropical surface pressure pattern called the Southern Oscillation.
This coupled atmosphere—ocean phenomenon, with preferred time
scales of two to about seven years, is known as the E/ Nifio-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO). It is often measured by the surface pressure anom-
aly difference between Tahiti and Darwin or the sea surface temper-
atures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific. During an ENSO
event, the prevailing trade winds weaken, reducing upwelling and
altering ocean currents such that the sea surface temperatures warm,
further weakening the trade winds. This event has a great impact on
the wind, sea surface temperature and precipitation patterns in the
tropical Pacific. It has climatic effects throughout the Pacific region and
in many other parts of the world, through global teleconnections. The
cold phase of ENSO is called La Nifia. For the corresponding indices, see

Effects on natural and human systems. In this report, the term impacts
is used primarily to refer to the effects on natural and human systems
of extreme weather and climate events and of climate change. Impacts
generally refer to effects on lives, livelihoods, health, ecosystems, econo-
mies, societies, cultures, services and infrastructure due to the interaction
of climate changes or hazardous climate events occurring within a spe-
cific time period and the vulnerability of an exposed society or system.
Impacts are also referred to as consequences and outcomes. The impacts
of climate change on geophysical systems, including floods, droughts
and sea level rise, are a subset of impacts called physical impacts. {WG//}

An effort to create financial value for the carbon stored in forests,
offering incentives for developing countries to reduce emissions from
forested lands and invest in low-carbon paths to sustainable devel-

from avoiding deforestation. REDD+ goes beyond reforestation and
forest degradation and includes the role of conservation, sustainable
management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks. The
concept was first introduced in 2005 in the 11th Session of the Con-
ference of the Parties (COP) in Montreal and later given greater recog-
nition in the 13th Session of the COP in 2007 at Bali and inclusion in
the Bali Action Plan which called for ‘policy approaches and positive
incentives on issues relating to reducing emissions from deforestation
and forest degradation in developing countries (REDD) and the role of
conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of
forest carbon stock in developing countries’. Since then, support for
REDD has increased and has slowly become a framework for action
supported by a number of countries. {WGiI/}

"he Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the leading international body for the assessment

of climate change. It was established by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World
Meteorological Organization (WMO) to provide an authoritative international assessment of the scientific
aspects of climate change, based on the most recent scientific, technical and socio-economic information
published worldwide. The IPCC’s periodic assessments of the causes, impacts and possible response strategies
to climate change are the most comprehensive and up-to-date reports available on the subject, and form the
standard reference for all concerned with climate change in academia, government and industry worldwide. This
Synthesis Report is the fourth element of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, Climate Change 2013/2014. More than
800 international experts assessed climate change in this Fifth Assessment Report. The three Working Group
contributions are available from the Cambridge University Press:
