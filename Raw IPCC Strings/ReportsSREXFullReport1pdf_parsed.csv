"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the leading international body for the assessment of climate change, including
the physical science of climate; impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability; and mitigation of climate change. The IPCC was established by the
United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) to provide the world with a

comprehensive assessment of the current state of knowledge of climate change and its potential environmental and socioeconomic

"Managing the Risks of Extreme Event:
and Disasters to Advance
Climate Change Adaptation
"	Title
"Extreme weather and climate events, interacting with exposed and vulnerable human and natural systems, can lead to disasters. This
Special Report explores the challenge of understanding and managing the risks of climate extremes to advance climate change adaptation.
Weather- and climate-related disasters have social as well as physical dimensions. As a result, changes in the frequency and severity of
the physical events affect disaster risk, but so do the spatially diverse and temporally dynamic patterns of exposure and vulnerability.
Some types of extreme weather and climate events have increased in frequency or magnitude, but populations and assets at risk have
also increased, with consequences for disaster risk. Opportunities for managing risks of weather- and climate-related disasters exist or
can be developed at any scale, local to international. Some strategies for effectively managing risks and adapting to climate change
involve adjustments to current activities. Others require transformation or fundamental change.

"This Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation
(SREX) has been jointly coordinated by Working Groups | (WGI) and II (WGIl) of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC). The report focuses on the relationship between climate change and extreme weather and
climate events, the impacts of such events, and the strategies to manage the associated risks.
"	Text
"The IPCC was jointly established in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations
Environment Programme (UNEP), in particular to assess in a comprehensive, objective, and transparent manner all the
relevant scientific, technical, and socioeconomic information to contribute in understanding the scientific basis of risk
of human-induced climate change, the potential impacts, and the adaptation and mitigation options. Beginning in
1990, the IPCC has produced a series of Assessment Reports, Special Reports, Technical Papers, methodologies, and
other key documents which have since become the standard references for policymakers and scientists.
"	Text
"This Special Report, in particular, contributes to frame the challenge of dealing with extreme weather and climate
events as an issue in decisionmaking under uncertainty, analyzing response in the context of risk management. The
report consists of nine chapters, covering risk management; observed and projected changes in extreme weather and
climate events; exposure and vulnerability to as well as losses resulting from such events; adaptation options from the

local to the international scale; the role of sustainable development in modulating risks; and insights from specific
case studies.

"The Special Report introduced some important innovations to the IPCC. One was the integration, in a single Special
Report, of skills and perspectives across the disciplines covered by WGI, WGIl, and the disaster risk management com-
munity. A second important innovation was the report's emphasis on adaptation and disaster risk management. A
third innovation was a plan for an ambitious outreach effort. Underlying these innovations and all aspects of the
report is a strong commitment to assessing science in a way that is relevant to policy but not policy prescriptive.
"	Text
"The Special Report brings together scientific communities with expertise in three very different aspects of managing
risks of extreme weather and climate events. For this report, specialists in disaster recovery, disaster risk management,
and disaster risk reduction, a community mostly new to the IPCC, joined forces with experts in the areas of the physical
science basis of climate change (WGl) and climate change impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability (WGIl). Over the

course of the two-plus years invested in assessing information and writing the report, scientists from these three
communities forged shared goals and products.
"	Text
"Extreme weather and climate events have figured prominently in past IPCC assessments. Extremes can contribute to
disasters, but disaster risk is influenced by more than just the physical hazards. Disaster risk emerges from the interaction
of weather or climate events, the physical contributors to disaster risk, with exposure and vulnerability, the contributors
to risk from the human side. The combination of severe consequences, rarity, and human as well as physical determinants
makes disasters difficult to study. Only over the last few years has the science of these events, their impacts, and
options for dealing with them become mature enough to support a comprehensive assessment. This report provides a
careful assessment of scientific, technical, and socioeconomic knowledge as of May 2011, the cut-off date for literature
included.
"	Text
"The Special Report represents the combined efforts of hundreds of leading experts. The Government of Norway and
the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction submitted a proposal for the report to the IPCC in
September 2008. This was followed by a scoping meeting to develop a candidate outline in March 2009. Following
approval of the outline in April 2009, governments and observer organizations nominated experts for the author team.
The team approved by the WGI and WGll Bureaux consisted of 87 Coordinating Lead Authors and Lead Authors, plus
19 Review Editors. In addition, 140 Contributing Authors submitted draft text and information to the author teams. The
drafts of the report were circulated twice for formal review, first to experts and second to both experts and governments,
resulting in 18,784 review comments. Author teams responded to every comment and, where scientifically appropriate,
modified drafts in response to comments, with Review Editors monitoring the process. The revised report was presented
for consideration at the First Joint Session of WGI and WGIl, from 14 to 17 November 2011. At the joint session,
delegates from over 100 countries evaluated and approved, by consensus, the Summary for Policymakers on a
line-by-line basis and accepted the full report.

with exposure of people and assets and their vulnerability. Chapter 2 explores the determinants of exposure and
vulnerability in detail, concluding that every disaster has social as well as physical dimensions. Chapter 3, the major
contribution of WGI, is an assessment of the scientific literature on observed and projected changes in extreme weather
and climate events, and their attribution to causes where possible. Chapter 4 assesses observed and projected
impacts, considering patterns by sector as well as region. Chapters 5 through 7 assess experience and theory in
adaptation to extremes and disasters, focusing on issues and opportunities at the local scale (Chapter 5), the national
scale (Chapter 6), and the international scale (Chapter 7). Chapter 8 assesses the interactions among sustainable
development, vulnerability reduction, and disaster risk, considering both opportunities and constraints, as well as the
kinds of transformations relevant to overcoming the constraints. Chapter 9 develops a series of case studies that
illustrate the role of real life complexity but also document examples of important progress in managing risk.

"	Title
"Figure SPM.1 | Illustration of the core concepts of SREX. The report assesses how exposure and vulnerability to weather and climate events determine impacts and the likelihood
of disasters (disaster risk). It evaluates the influence of natural climate variability and anthropogenic climate change on climate extremes and other weather and climate events
that can contribute to disasters, as well as the exposure and vulnerability of human society and natural ecosystems. It also considers the role of development in trends in exposure
and vulnerability, implications for disaster risk, and interactions between disasters and development. The report examines how disaster risk management and adaptation to climate
change can reduce exposure and vulnerability to weather and climate events and thus reduce disaster risk, as well as increase resilience to the risks that cannot be eliminated.
Other important processes are largely outside the scope of this report, including the influence of development on greenhouse gas emissions and anthropogenic climate change,
and the potential for mitigation of anthropogenic climate change. [1.1.2, Figure 1-1]

"This Summary for Policymakers presents key findings from the Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme
Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX). The SREX approaches the topic by assessing the
scientific literature on issues that range from the relationship between climate change and extreme weather and
climate events (‘climate extremes’) to the implications of these events for society and sustainable development. The
assessment concerns the interaction of climatic, environmental, and human factors that can lead to impacts and
disasters, options for managing the risks posed by impacts and disasters, and the important role that non-climatic
factors play in determining impacts. Box SPM.1 defines concepts central to the SREX.
"	Text
"The character and severity of impacts from climate extremes depend not only on the extremes themselves but also on
exposure and vulnerability. In this report, adverse impacts are considered disasters when they produce widespread
damage and cause severe alterations in the normal functioning of communities or societies. Climate extremes,
exposure, and vulnerability are influenced by a wide range of factors, including anthropogenic climate change, natural
climate variability, and socioeconomic development (Figure SPM.1). Disaster risk management and adaptation to
climate change focus on reducing exposure and vulnerability and increasing resilience to the potential adverse impacts
of climate extremes, even though risks cannot fully be eliminated (Figure SPM.2). Although mitigation of climate
change is not the focus of this report, adaptation and mitigation can complement each other and together can
significantly reduce the risks of climate change. [SYR AR4, 5.3]

"| Reflecting the diversity of the communities involved in this assessment and progress in science, several of the definitions used in this Special Report differ in breadth or
focus from those used in the Fourth Assessment Report and other IPCC reports.

2 This definition differs from that in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), where climate change is defined as: “a change of climate
which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability
observed over comparable time periods.” The UNFCCC thus makes a distinction between climate change attributable to human activities altering the atmospheric

"Exposure and vulnerability are key determinants of disaster risk and of impacts when risk is realized.
(1.1.2, 1.2.3, 1.3, 2.2.1, 2.3, 2.5] For example, a tropical cyclone can have very different impacts depending on where
and when it makes landfall. [2.5.1, 3.1, 4.4.6] Similarly, a heat wave can have very different impacts on different
populations depending on their vulnerability. [Box 4-4, 9.2.1] Extreme impacts on human, ecological, or physical
systems can result from individual extreme weather or climate events. Extreme impacts can also result from non-
extreme events where exposure and vulnerability are high [2.2.1, 2.3, 2.5] or from a compounding of events or their
impacts. [1.1.2, 1.2.3, 3.1.3] For example, drought, coupled with extreme heat and low humidity, can increase the risk

in the number of warm days and nights, at the global scale, that is, for most land areas with sufficient data. It is likel
that these changes have also occurred at the continental scale in North America, Europe, and Australia. There is medium
confidence in a warming trend in daily temperature extremes in much of Asia. Confidence in observed trends in daily
temperature extremes in Africa and South America generally varies from /ow to medium depending on the region. In

"There is evidence from observations gathered since 1950 of change in some extremes. Confidence in
observed changes in extremes depends on the quality and quantity of data and the availability of studies
analyzing these data, which vary across regions and for different extremes. Assigning ‘low confidence’ in
observed changes in a specific extreme on regional or global scales neither implies nor excludes the
possibility of changes in this extreme. Extreme events are rare, which means there are few data available to make
assessments regarding changes in their frequency or intensity. The more rare the event the more difficult it is to identify
long-term changes. Global-scale trends in a specific extreme may be either more reliable (e.g., for temperature
extremes) or less reliable (e.g., for droughts) than some regional-scale trends, depending on the geographical uniformity
of the trends in the specific extreme. The following paragraphs provide further details for specific climate extremes
from observations since 1950. [3.1.5, 3.1.6, 3.2.1]

"Disaster Losses
"	Title
"Economic losses from weather- and climate-related disasters have increased, but with large spatial and
interannual variability (high confidence, based on high agreement, medium evidence). Global weather- and
climate-related disaster losses reported over the last few decades reflect mainly monetized direct damages to assets,
and are unequally distributed. Estimates of annual losses have ranged since 1980 from a few US$ billion to above
200 billion (in 2010 dollars), with the highest value for 2005 (the year of Hurricane Katrina). Loss estimates are lower-
bound estimates because many impacts, such as loss of human lives, cultural heritage, and ecosystem services, are
difficult to value and monetize, and thus they are poorly reflected in estimates of losses. Impacts on the informal or
undocumented economy as well as indirect economic effects can be very important in some areas and sectors, but are
generally not counted in reported estimates of losses. [4.5.1, 4.5.3, 4.5.4]
"	Text
"Increasing exposure of people and economic assets has been the major cause of long-term increases in
economic losses from weather- and climate-related disasters (high confidence). Long-term trends in economic
disaster losses adjusted for wealth and population increases have not been attributed to climate change,
but a role for climate change has not been excluded (high agreement, medium evidence). These conclusions
are subject to a number of limitations in studies to date. Vulnerability is a key factor in disaster losses, yet it is not well
accounted for. Other limitations are: (i) data availability, as most data are available for standard economic sectors in
developed countries; and (ii) type of hazards studied, as most studies focus on cyclones, where confidence in observed
trends and attribution of changes to human influence is /ow. The second conclusion is subject to additional limitations:
(iii) the processes used to adjust loss data over time, and (iv) record length. [4.5.3]

expanding asset bases have borne the largest burden. During the period from 2001 to 2006, losses amounted to about
1% of GDP for middle-income countries, while this ratio has been about 0.3% of GDP for low-income countries and
less than 0.1% of GDP for high-income countries, based on limited evidence. In small exposed countries, particularly
small island developing states, losses expressed as a percentage of GDP have been particularly high, exceeding 1% in
many cases and 8% in the most extreme cases, averaged over both disaster and non-disaster years for the period from
1970 to 2010. [4.5.2, 4.5.4]

"There is evidence that some extremes have changed as a result of anthropogenic influences, including
increases in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. It is /ikely that anthropogenic influences have led
to warming of extreme daily minimum and maximum temperatures at the global scale. There is medium confidence
that anthropogenic influences have contributed to intensification of extreme precipitation at the global scale. It is
likely that there has been an anthropogenic influence on increasing extreme coastal high water due to an increase in
mean sea level. The uncertainties in the historical tropical cyclone records, the incomplete understanding of the physical
mechanisms linking tropical cyclone metrics to climate change, and the degree of tropical cyclone variability provide
only low confidence for the attribution of any detectable changes in tropical cyclone activity to anthropogenic
influences. Attribution of single extreme events to anthropogenic climate change is challenging. [3.2.2, 3.3.1, 3.3.2,

"Humanitarian relief is often required when disaster risk reduction measures are absent or inadequate
(high agreement, robust evidence). [5.2.1] Smaller or economically less-diversified countries face particular
challenges in providing the public goods associated with disaster risk management, in absorbing the losses caused by
climate extremes and disasters, and in providing relief and reconstruction assistance. [6.4.3]

"Data on disasters and disaster risk reduction are lacking at the local level, which can constrain improvements
in local vulnerability reduction (high agreement, medium evidence). [5.7] There are few examples of national
disaster risk management systems and associated risk management measures explicitly integrating knowledge of and
uncertainties in projected changes in exposure, vulnerability, and climate extremes. [6.6.2, 6.6.4]
"	Text
"Trends in exposure and vulnerability are major drivers of changes in disaster risk (high confidence). [2.5]
Understanding the multi-faceted nature of both exposure and vulnerability is a prerequisite for determining how
weather and climate events contribute to the occurrence of disasters, and for designing and implementing effective
adaptation and disaster risk management strategies. [2.2, 2.6] Vulnerability reduction is a core common element of
adaptation and disaster risk management. [2.2, 2.3]

"Post-disaster recovery and reconstruction provide an opportunity for reducing weather- and climate-related
disaster risk and for improving adaptive capacity (high agreement, robust evidence). An emphasis on rapidly
rebuilding houses, reconstructing infrastructure, and rehabilitating livelihoods often leads to recovering in ways that
recreate or even increase existing vulnerabilities, and that preclude longer-term planning and policy changes for
enhancing resilience and sustainable development. [5.2.3] See also assessment in Sections 8.4.1 and 8.5.2.

"Inequalities influence local coping and adaptive capacity, and pose disaster risk management and adaptation
challenges from the local to national levels (high agreement, robust evidence). These inequalities reflect
socioeconomic, demographic, and health-related differences and differences in governance, access to livelihoods,
entitlements, and other factors. [5.5.1, 6.2] Inequalities also exist across countries: developed countries are often better
equipped financially and institutionally to adopt explicit measures to effectively respond and adapt to projected
changes in exposure, vulnerability, and climate extremes than are developing countries. Nonetheless, all countries face
challenges in assessing, understanding, and responding to such projected changes. [6.3.2, 6.6]
"	Text
"Development practice, policy, and outcomes are critical to shaping disaster risk, which may be increased
by shortcomings in development (high confidence). [1.1.2, 1.1.3] High exposure and vulnerability are generally
the outcome of skewed development processes such as those associated with environmental degradation, rapid and
unplanned urbanization in hazardous areas, failures of governance, and the scarcity of livelihood options for the poor.
(2.2.2, 2.5] Increasing global interconnectivity and the mutual interdependence of economic and ecological systems
can have sometimes contrasting effects, reducing or amplifying vulnerability and disaster risk. [7.2.1] Countries more
effectively manage disaster risk if they include considerations of disaster risk in national development and sector plans
and if they adopt climate change adaptation strategies, translating these plans and strategies into actions targeting
vulnerable areas and groups. [6.2, 6.5.2]

"Attention to the temporal and spatial dynamics of exposure and vulnerability is particularly important
given that the design and implementation of adaptation and disaster risk management strategies and

immediate protection, but also encourage settlement patterns that may increase risk in the long term. [2.4.2, 2.5.4,

recovery of livelihoods, and reconstruction; reducing vulnerability; and providing knowledge and incentives for reducing

factors, including the type of extreme, the region and season, the amount and quality of observational
data, the level of understanding of the underlying processes, and the reliability of their simulation in

in the coming two to three decades, but these signals are relatively small compared to natural climate variability over
this time frame. Even the sign of projected changes in some climate extremes over this time frame is uncertain. For

"It is likely that the frequency of heavy precipitation or the proportion of total rainfall from heavy falls will
increase in the 21st century over many areas of the globe. This is particularly the case in the high latitudes and
tropical regions, and in winter in the northern mid-latitudes. Heavy rainfalls associated with tropical cyclones are likely
to increase with continued warming. There is medium confidence that, in some regions, increases in heavy precipitation
will occur despite projected decreases in total precipitation in those regions. Based on a range of emissions scenarios
(B1, A1B, A2), a 1-in-20 year annual maximum daily precipitation amount is likely to become a 1-in-5 to 1-in-15 year

"Models project substantial warming in temperature extremes by the end of the 21st century. It is virtually
certain that increases in the frequency and magnitude of warm daily temperature extremes and decreases in cold
extremes will occur in the 21st century at the global scale. It is very likely that the length, frequency, and/or intensity
of warm spells or heat waves will increase over most land areas. Based on the A1B and A2 emissions scenarios, a
1-in-20 year hottest day is likely to become a 1-in-2 year event by the end of the 21st century in most regions, except
in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, where it is likely to become a 1-in-5 year event (see Figure SPM.4A).
Under the B1 scenario, a 1-in-20 year event would likely become a 1-in-5 year event (and a 1-in-10 year event in
Northern Hemisphere high latitudes). The 1-in-20 year extreme daily maximum temperature (i.e., a value that was
exceeded on average only once during the period 1981-2000) will /ikely increase by about 1°C to 3°C by the mid-21st

"Implications for Sustainable Development
"	Title
"importance of these trends for decisionmaking depends on their magnitude and degree of certainty at the temporal
and spatial scale of the risk being managed and on the available capacity to implement risk management options
(see Table SPM.1).
"	Text
"The interactions among climate change mitigation, adaptation, and disaster risk management may have
major influence on resilient and sustainable pathways (high agreement, limited evidence). |nteractions

between the goals of mitigation and adaptation in particular will play out locally, but have global consequences.
(8.2.5, 8.5.2]
"	Text
"Social, economic, and environmental sustainability can be enhanced by disaster risk management and
adaptation approaches. A prerequisite for sustainability in the context of climate change is addressing the
underlying causes of vulnerability, including the structural inequalities that create and sustain poverty and
constrain access to resources (medium agreement, robust evidence). This involves integrating disaster risk
management and adaptation into all social, economic, and environmental policy domains. [8.6.2, 8.7]
"	Text
"Progress toward resilient and sustainable development in the context of changing climate extremes can
benefit from questioning assumptions and paradigms and stimulating innovation to encourage new
patterns of response (medium agreement, robust evidence). Successfully addressing disaster risk, climate
change, and other stressors often involves embracing broad participation in strategy development, the capacity to
combine multiple perspectives, and contrasting ways of organizing social relations. [8.2.5, 8.6.3, 8.7]
"	Text
"The most effective adaptation and disaster risk reduction actions are those that offer development benefits
in the relatively near term, as well as reductions in vulnerability over the longer term (high agreement,
medium evidence). There are tradeoffs between current decisions and long-term goals linked to diverse values,
interests, and priorities for the future. Short- and long-term perspectives on disaster risk management and adaptation
to climate change thus can be difficult to reconcile. Such reconciliation involves overcoming the disconnect between
local risk management practices and national institutional and legal frameworks, policy, and planning. [8.2.1, 8.3.1,
8.3.2, 8.6.1]
"	Text
"There are many approaches and pathways to a sustainable and resilient future. [8.2.3, 8.4.1, 8.6.1, 8.7] However, limits
to resilience are faced when thresholds or tipping points associated with social and/or natural systems are exceeded,
posing severe challenges for adaptation. [8.5.1] Choices and outcomes for adaptive actions to climate events must
reflect divergent capacities and resources and multiple interacting processes. Actions are framed by tradeoffs between
competing prioritized values and objectives, and different visions of development that can change over time. Iterative
approaches allow development pathways to integrate risk management so that diverse policy solutions can be
considered, as risk and its measurement, perception, and understanding evolve over time. [8.2.3, 8.4.1, 8.6.1, 8.7]
"	Text
"Actions that range from incremental steps to transformational changes are essential for reducing risk from
climate extremes (high agreement, robust evidence). Incremental steps aim to improve efficiency within existing
technological, governance, and value systems, whereas transformation may involve alterations of fundamental attributes
of those systems. Transformations, where they are required, are also facilitated through increased emphasis on adaptive
management and learning. Where vulnerability is high and adaptive capacity low, changes in climate extremes can
make it difficult for systems to adapt sustainably without transformational changes. Vulnerability is often concentrated
in lower-income countries or groups, although higher-income countries or groups can also be vulnerable to climate
extremes. [8.6, 8.6.3, 8.7]

with the adverse effects associated with weather and climate events

that despite increasing knowledge and understanding of the factors
that lead to adverse effects, and despite important advances over
recent decades in the reduction of loss of life with the occurrence of
hydrometeorological events (mainly attributable to important advances
with early warning systems, e.g., Section 9.2.11), social intervention in
the face of historical climate variability has not kept pace with the rapid
increases in other adverse economic and social effects suffered during
this period (ICSU, 2008) (high confidence). Instead, a rapid growth in
real economic losses and livelihood disruption has occurred in many
parts of the world (UNISDR, 2009e, 2011). In regard to losses associated
with tropical cyclones, recent analysis has shown that, with the exception
of the East Asian and Pacific and South Asian regions, “both exposure
and the estimated risk of economic loss are growing faster than GDP
per capita. Thus the risk of losing wealth in disasters associated with
tropical cyclones is increasing faster than wealth itself is increasing”

these questions from both a regional and a sectoral perspective, and
examines the direct and indirect economic costs of such changes and
their relation to development.

Each chapter reviews the efficacy of current disaster risk reduction,

mechanisms including national budgets, development goals, planning,
warning systems, and building codes may be employed to manage, for
example, food security and agriculture, water resources, forests,
fisheries, building practice, and public health. Chapter 7 carries this

local communities and governments, both individually and in aggregate
(UNISDR, 2009e, 2011) (high confidence).

"The hazardous physical events referred to in the definition of disaster
may be of natural, socio-natural (originating in the human degradation
or transformation of the physical environment), or purely anthropogenic
origins (see Lavell, 1996, 1999; Smith, 1996; Tobin and Montz, 1997;
Wisner et al., 2004). This Special Report emphasizes hydrometeorological
and oceanographic events; a subset of a broader spectrum of physical
events that may acquire the characteristic of a hazard if conditions of
exposure and vulnerability convert them into a threat. These include
earthquakes, volcanoes, and tsunamis, among others. Any one geographic
area may be affected by one, or a combination of, such events at the
same or different times. Both in this report and in the wider literature,
some events (e.g., floods and droughts) are at times referred to as
physical impacts (see Section 3.1.1).

"For example, many of the ‘disasters’ registered in the widely consulted
University of Louvaine EM-DAT database (CRED, 2010) are not initiated
by statistically extreme events, but rather exhibit extreme properties
expressed as severe interruptions in the functioning of local social and
economic systems. This lack of connection is even more obvious in the
Desinventar database (Corporacion OSSO, 2010), developed first in
Latin America in order to specifically register the occurrence of small-
and medium-scale disasters, and which has registered tens and tens of
thousands of these during the last 30 years in the 29 countries it covers
to date. This database has been used by the UNISDR, the Inter-American
Development Bank, and others to examine disaster occurrence, scale,
and impacts in Latin America and Asia, in particular (Cardona 2005,
2008; IDEA, 2005; UNISDR, 2009e, 2011; ERN-AL, 2011). In any one
place, the range of disaster-inducing events can increase if social
conditions deteriorate (Wisner et al., 2004, 2011).

"Vulnerability is defined generically in this report as the propensity or
predisposition to be adversely affected. Such predisposition constitutes
an internal characteristic of the affected element. In the field of disaster
risk, this includes the characteristics of a person or group and their

livelihoods, environmental services and resources, infrastructure, or
economic, social, or cultural assets in places that could be adversely
affected by physical events and which, thereby, are subject to potential
future harm, loss, or damage. This definition subsumes physical and
biological systems under the concept of ‘environmental services and

i) they impact livelihoods negatively by seriously affecting ecosystem
services and the natural resource base of communities; ii) they have
consequences for food security; and/or iii) they have impacts on human

variously modified in different fields and applications in the interim
(Adger, 2006; Eakin and Luers, 2006; Ftissel, 2007). Vulnerability has
been evaluated according to a variety of quantitative and qualitative
metrics (Coburn and Spence, 2002; Schneider et al., 2007; Cardona,

causes of vulnerability are provided in Chapter 2.

"is defined here as the potential occurrence of a natural or human-
induced physical event that may cause loss of life, injury, or other
health impacts, as well as damage and loss to property, infrastructure,
livelihoods, service provision, and environmental resources. Physical
events become hazards where social elements (or environmental
resources that support human welfare and security) are exposed to
their potentially adverse impacts and exist under conditions that could
predispose them to such effects. Thus, hazard is used in this study to
denote a threat or potential for adverse effects, not the physical event
itself (Cardona, 1986, 1996, 2011; Smith, 1996; Tobin and Montz, 1997;

over a specified time period of severe alterations in the normal
functioning of a community or a society due to hazardous physical
events interacting with vulnerable social conditions, leading to
widespread adverse human, material, economic, or environmental
effects that require immediate emergency response to satisfy critical
human needs and that may require external support for recovery.
Disaster risk derives from a combination of physical hazards and the
vulnerabilities of exposed elements and will signify the potential for
severe interruption of the normal functioning of the affected society once
it materializes as disaster. This qualitative statement will be expressed
formally later in this assessment (Section 1.3 and Chapter 2).

"Extreme impacts on the physical environment are addressed in Section
3.5 and extreme impacts on ecosystems are considered in detail in
Chapter 4. In excluding such impacts from the definition of ‘disaster’ as
employed here, this chapter is in no way underestimating their broader
significance (e.g., in regard to existence value) or suggesting they
should not be dealt with under the rubric of adaptation concerns and
management needs. Rather, we are establishing their relative position
within the conceptual framework of climate-related, socially-defined
‘disaster’ and ‘disaster risk’ and the management options that are
available for promoting disaster risk reduction and adaptation to climate
change (see Section 1.1.2.2 and the Glossary for definitions of these
terms). Thus this report draws a distinction between ‘social disaster,’
where extreme impacts on the physical and ecological systems may or
may not play a part, and so-called ‘environmental disaster,’ where direct
physical impacts of human activity and natural physical processes on

"The importance of vulnerability to the disaster risk management
community may be appreciated in the way it has helped to highlight the
role of social factors in the constitution of risk, moving away from purely
physical explanations and attributions of loss and damage (see Hewitt,
1983 for an early critique of what he denominated the ‘physicalist’
interpretation of disaster). Differential levels of vulnerability will lead
to differential levels of damage and loss under similar conditions of
exposure to physical events of a given magnitude (Dow, 1992; Wisner
et al., 2011).

"The fundamentally social connotation and ‘predictive’ value of
vulnerability is emphasized in the definition used here. The earlier
IPCC definition of vulnerability refers, however, to “the degree to which
a system is susceptible to and unable to cope with adverse effects of
climate change, including climate variability and extremes. Vulnerability
is a function of the character, magnitude, and rate of climate change and
variation to which a system is exposed, its sensitivity, and its adaptive
capacity” (IPCC, 2007c, p. 883). This definition makes physical causes and
their effects an explicit aspect of vulnerability while the social context
is encompassed by the notions of sensitivity and adaptive capacity
(these notions are defined later). In the definition used in this report, the
social context is emphasized explicitly, and vulnerability is considered
independent of physical events (Hewitt, 1983, 1997, 2007;
Weichselgartner, 2001; Cannon, 2006; O'Brien et al., 2007).

"No. Disaster entails social, economic, or environmental impacts that severely disrupt the normal functioning of affected communities.
Extreme weather and climate events will lead to disaster if: 1) communities are exposed to those events; and 2) exposure to potentially
damaging extreme events is accompanied by a high level of vulnerability (a predisposition for loss and damage). On the other hand,
disasters are also triggered by events that are not extreme in a statistical sense. High exposure and vulnerability levels will transform
even some small-scale events into disasters for some affected communities. Recurrent small- or medium-scale events affecting the same
communities may lead to serious erosion of its development base and livelihood options, thus increasing vulnerability. The timing (when
they occur during the day, month, or year) and sequence (similar events in succession or different events contemporaneously) of such
events is often critical to their human impact. The relative importance of the underlying physical and social determinants of disaster risk
varies with the scale of the event and the levels of exposure and vulnerability. Because the impact of lesser events is exacerbated by
physical, ecological, and social conditions that increase exposure and vulnerability, these events disproportionately affect resource-poor
communities with little access to alternatives for reducing hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. The potential negative consequences of
extreme events can be moderated in important ways (but rarely eliminated completely) by implementing corrective disaster risk
management strategies that are reactive, adaptive, and anticipatory, and by sustainable development.

to anticipate, absorb, accommodate, or recover from the effects of a
potentially hazardous event in a timely and efficient manner, including
through ensuring the preservation, restoration, or improvement of its
essential basic structures and functions. As Gaillard (2010) points out,
this term has been used in disaster studies since the 1970s (Torry, 1979)
and has its origins in engineering (Gordon, 1978), ecology (Holling,
1973) and child psychology (Werner et al., 1971).

"Disaster risk management is concerned with both disaster and disaster
risk of differing levels and intensities. In other words, it is not restricted
to a ‘manual’ for the management of the risk or disasters associated with
extreme events, but rather includes the conceptual framework that
describes and anticipates intervention in the overall and diverse patterns,
scales, and levels of interaction of exposure, hazard, and vulnerability
that can lead to disaster. A major recent concern of disaster risk
management has been that disasters are associated more and more with
lesser-scale physical phenomena that are not extreme in a physical sense
(see Section 1.1.1). This is principally attributed to increases in exposure
and associated vulnerability (UNISDR, 2009e, 2011).

"Although now widely employed in the fields of disaster risk management
and adaptation, resilience has been subject to a wide range of
interpretations and levels of acceptance as a concept (Timmerman,
1981; Adger, 2000; Klein et al., 2003; Berkes et al., 2004; Folke, 2006;
Gallopin, 2006; Manyena, 2006; Brand and Jax, 2007; Gaillard 2007;
Bosher, 2008; Cutter et al., 2008; Kelman, 2008; Lewis and Kelman,
2009; Bahadur et al., 2010; Aven, 2011). Thus, for example, the term is
used by some in reference to situations at any point along the risk
‘cycle’ or ‘continuum’, that is, before, during, or after the impact of the
physical event. And, in a different vein, some consider the notions of
‘vulnerability’ and ‘capacity’ as being sufficient for explaining the ranges
of success or failure that are found in different recovery scenarios and
are thus averse to the use of the term at all (Wisner et al., 2004, 2011).
Under this latter formulation, vulnerability both potentiates original loss
and damage and also impedes recovery, while capacity building can
change this adverse balance and contribute to greater sustainability
and reduced disaster risk.

"Disaster risk reduction denotes both a policy goal or objective, and
the strategic and instrumental measures employed for anticipating
future disaster risk, reducing existing exposure, hazard, or vulnerability,
and improving resilience. This includes lessening the vulnerability of
people, livelihoods, and assets and ensuring the appropriate sustainable
management of land, water, and other components of the environment.
Emphasis is on universal concepts and strategies involved in the
consideration of reducing disaster risks, including actions and activities
enacted pre-impact, and when recovery and reconstruction call for
the anticipation of new disaster risk scenarios or conditions. A strong
relationship between disaster risk and disaster risk reduction, and
development and development planning has been established and
validated, particularly, but not exclusively, in developing country
contexts (UNEP, 1972; Cuny, 1983; Sen, 1983; Hagman, 1984; Wijkman

"Older conceptions of resilience, as ‘bouncing back,’ and its conceptual
cousin, coping (see Section 1.4), have implicitly emphasized a return to
a previous status quo or some other marginally acceptable level, such
as ‘surviving,’ as opposed to generating a cyclical process that leads
to continually improving conditions, as in ‘bouncing forward’ and/or
eventually ‘thriving’ (Davies, 1993; Manyena, 2006). However, the
dynamic and often uncertain consequences of climate change (as well as
ongoing, now longstanding, development trends such as urbanization)
for hazard and vulnerability profiles underscore the fact that ‘bouncing
back’ is an increasingly insufficient goal for disaster risk management
(Pelling, 2003; Vale and Campanella, 2005; Pendalla et al., 2010)
(high confidence). Recent conceptions of resilience of social-ecological
systems focus more on process than outcomes (e.g., Norris et al., 2008),
including the ability to self-organize, learn, and adapt over time (see
Chapter 8). Some definitions of resilience, such as that used in this
report, now also include the idea of anticipation and ‘improvement’ of
essential basic structures and functions. Section 1.4 examines the
importance of learning that is emphasized within this more forward-
looking application of resilience. Chapter 8 builds on the importance of
learning by drawing also from literature that has explored the scope for
innovation, leadership, and adaptive management. Together these
strategies offer potential pathways for transforming existing development
visions, goals, and practices into more sustainable and resilient futures.

institutional and organizational arrangements for disaster management
under scrutiny. The prior dominance of response-based and infrastructure

"Over the last two decades, the more integral notion of disaster risk
management and its risk reduction and disaster management components
has tended to replace the unique conception and terminology of ‘disaster
and emergency management’ that prevailed almost unilaterally up to
the beginning of the 1990s and that emphasized disaster as opposed to
disaster risk as the central issue to be confronted. Disaster as such
ordered the thinking on required intervention processes, whereas with
disaster risk management, disaster risk now tends to assume an
increasingly dominant position in thought and action in this field (see
Hewitt, 1983; Blaikie et al., 1994; Smith, 1996; Hewitt, 1997; Tobin and

"With regard to the influence of actions taken at one stage of the ‘cycle’
on other stages, much has been written, for example, on how the form
and method of response to disaster itself may affect future disaster risk
reduction efforts. The fostering of active community involvement, the
use of existing local and community capacities and resources, and
the decentralization of decisionmaking to the local level in disaster
preparedness and response, among other factors, have been considered
critical for also improving understanding of disaster risk and the
development of future disaster risk reduction efforts (Anderson and
Woodrow, 1989; Alexander, 2000; Lavell, 2003; Wisner et al., 2004)

and on the future needs for preparedness and response.

"Disaster management refers to social processes for designing,
implementing, and evaluating strategies, policies, and measures
that promote and improve disaster preparedness, response, and recovery
practices at different organizational and societal levels. Disaster
management processes are enacted once the immediacy of the disaster
event has become evident and resources and capacities are put in place
with which to respond prior to and following impact. These include the
activation of early warning systems, contingency planning, emergency
response (immediate post-impact support to satisfy critical human
needs under conditions of severe stress), and, eventually, recovery
(Alexander, 2000; Wisner et al., 2011). Disaster management is required
due to the existence of ‘residual’ disaster risk that ongoing disaster
risk reduction processes have not mitigated or reduced sufficiently or
eliminated or prevented completely (IDB, 2007).

"The cycle notion, criticized for its mechanistic depiction of the intervention
process, for insufficient consideration of the ways different components
and actions merge and can act synergistically with and influence each
other, and for its incorporation of disaster risk reduction considerations
under the rubric of ‘disaster management’ (Lavell and Franco, 1996;
Lewis, 1999; Wisner et al., 2004; Balamir, 2005; van Niekerk, 2007), has
tended to give way over time, in many parts of the world, to the more
comprehensive approach and concept of disaster risk management with
its consideration of distinct risk reduction and disaster intervention
components. The move toward a conception oriented in terms of disaster
risk and not disaster per se has led to initiatives to develop the notion
of a ‘disaster risk continuum’ whereby risk is seen to evolve and
change constantly, requiring different modalities of intervention over
time, from pre-impact risk reduction through response to new risk
conditions following disaster impacts and the need for control of new
risk factors in reconstruction (see Lavell, 2003).

"Growing disaster losses have led to rapidly increasing concerns for post-
impact financing of response and recovery (UNISDR, 2009e, 2011). In this
context, the concept and practice of disaster risk transfer has received
increased interest and achieved greater salience. Risk transfer refers to
the process of formally or informally shifting the financial consequences
of particular risks from one party to another, whereby a household,
community, enterprise, or state authority will obtain resources from
the other party after a disaster occurs, in exchange for ongoing or
compensatory social or financial benefits provided to that other party.
Disaster risk transfer mechanisms comprise a component of both disaster
management and disaster risk reduction. In the former case, financial
provision is made to face up to the impacts and consequences of disaster
once this materializes. In the latter case, the adequate use of insurance
premiums, for example, can promote and encourage the use of disaster
risk reduction measures in the insured elements. Chapters 5, 6, 7, and 9

"Disaster risk prevention and disaster prevention refer, in a strict sense,
to the elimination or avoidance of the underlying causes and conditions
that lead to disaster, thus precluding the possibility of either disaster

on the fact that disaster risk is manageable and its materialization is
preventable to an extent (which varies depending on the context).
Prospective (proactive) disaster risk management and adaptation
can contribute in important ways to avoiding future, and not just reducing
existing, risk and disaster once they have become manifest, as is the case
with corrective or reactive management (Lavell, 2003; UNISDR, 2011).

"The notions of hazard, exposure, vulnerability, disaster risk, capacity,
resilience, and coping, and their social origins and bases, as presented
above, reflect an emerging understanding that disaster risk and disaster,
while potentiated by an objective, physical condition, are fundamentally
a ‘social construction,’ the result of social choice, social constraints, and
societal action and inaction (high confidence). The notion of social
construction of risk implies that management can take into account the
social variables involved and to the best of its ability work toward
risk reduction, disaster management, or risk transfer through socially
sustainable decisions and concerted human action (ICSU-LAC, 2009).
This of course does not mean that there are not risks that may be too
great to reduce significantly through human intervention, or others
that the very social construction process may in fact exacerbate (see
Sections 1.3.1.2 and 1.4.3). But in contrast with, for example, many
natural physical events and their contribution to disaster risk, the
component of risk that is socially constructed is subject to intervention
in favor of risk reduction.

differential access to information and education, varying levels of

Significant differentiation in the distribution or allocation of gains from

of the political, economic, social, cultural, physical, and psychological
elements or determinants of risk leads to a spectrum of potential outcomes
of physical events, including those captured under the notion of
extreme impacts (Section 1.2 and Chapter 4). Accordingly, risk
assessment (see Section 1.3) using both quantitative and qualitative

complete description of risk and risk causation processes (Section 1.3;
Douglas and Wildavsky, 1982; Cardona, 2004; Wisner et al., 2004; Weber,

system functioning so that forecasting physical events becomes less
determined by past trends. Under these conditions, the processes that
cause, and the established indicators of, human vulnerability need to be
reconsidered in order for risk assessment to remain an effective tool.
The essential nature and structure of the characteristics that typify
vulnerability can of course change without climate changing.

that influence their successful practice: 1) the degree to which the focus
is on extreme events (instead of a more inclusive approach that considers
the full continuum of physical events with potential for damage, the social
contexts in which they occur, and the potential for such events to generate
‘extreme impacts’ or disasters); and 2) consideration of the appropriate
social-territorial scale that should be examined (i.e., aggregations, see

"Within this context, disaster risk reduction and adaptation to climate
change are undoubtedly far closer practically than when emergency or
disaster management objectives dominated the discourse and practice. The
fact that many in the climate change and disaster fields have associated
disaster risk management principally with disaster preparedness and
response, and not with disaster risk reduction per se, contributed to the
view that the two practices are essentially different, if complementary
(Lavell, 2010; Mercer, 2010). Once the developmental basis of adaptation
to climate change and disaster risk management are considered, along

"As illustrated in Box 1-1, many of the extreme impacts associated with
climate change, and their attendant additional risks and opportunities,
will inevitably need to be understood and responded to principally at
the scale of the individual, the individual household, and the community,
in the framework of localities and nations and their organizational and
management options, and in the context of the many other day-to-day
changes, including those of an economic, political, technological, and
cultural nature. As this real example illustrates, everyday life, history, and
a sequence of crises can affect attitudes and ways of approaching more
extreme or complex problems. In contrast, many agents and institutions
of disaster risk management and climate change adaptation activities
necessarily operate from a different perspective, given the still highly
centralized and hierarchical authority approaches found in many parts
of the world today.

"Additionally, attention to the role of small- and medium-scale disasters
(UNISDR, 2009e, 2011) highlights the need to deal integrally with the
problem of cumulative disaster loss and damage, looking across the
different scales of experience both in human and physical worlds,
in order to advance the efficacy of disaster risk management and
adaptation. The design of mechanisms and strategies based on the
reduction and elimination of everyday or chronic risk factors (Sen, 1983;
World Bank, 2001), as opposed to actions based solely on the
‘exceptional’ or ‘extreme’ events, is one obvious corollary of this
approach. The ability to deal with risk, crisis, and change is closely
related to an individual's life experience with smaller-scale, more
regular physical and social occurrences (Maskrey, 1989, 2011; Lavell,
2003; Wisner et al., 2004) (high confidence). These concepts point
toward the possibility of reducing vulnerability and increasing resilience
to climate-related disaster by broadly focusing on exposure, vulnerability,
and socially-determined propensity or predisposition to adverse effects
across a range of risks.

geophysical phenomena such as a moderate storm surge coinciding
with an extreme spring tide, as in the most catastrophic UK storm surge
flood of the past 500 years in 1607 (Horsburgh and Horritt, 2006).
Climate change may alter both the frequency of extreme surges and
cause gradual sea level rise, compounding such future extreme floods

(see also FAQ 6.1): “At the simplest level the weather is what is happening
to the atmosphere at any given time. Climate in a narrow sense is
usually defined as the ‘average weather,’ or more rigorously, as the
statistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevant
quantities over a period of time.”

"Weather and climate phenomena reflect the interaction of dynamic and
thermodynamic processes over a very wide range of space and temporal
scales. This complexity results in highly variable atmospheric conditions,
including temperatures, motions, and precipitation, a component of
which is referred to as ‘extreme events.’ Extreme events include the
passage of an intense tornado lasting minutes and the persistence of
drought conditions over decades — a span of at least seven orders of
magnitude of timescales. An imprecise distinction between extreme
‘weather’ and ‘climate’ events, based on their characteristic timescales,
is drawn in Section 3.1.2. Similarly, the spatial scale of extreme climate

"Some literature reserve the term ‘extreme event’ for initial meteorological

the consequential physical impacts, like flooding (Young, 2002), and some
the entire spectrum of outcomes for humans, society, and ecosystems
(Rich et al., 2008). In this report, we use ‘extreme (weather or climate)
event’ to refer solely to the initial and consequent physical phenomena
including some (e.g., flooding) that may have human components to
causation other than that related to the climate (e.g., land use or land
cover change or changes in water management; see Section 3.1.2 and
Glossary). The spectrum of outcomes for humans, society, and physical

of the definition of ‘events’ (see Sections 1.1.2.1 and 3.1.2 and the

"Disaster signifies extreme impacts suffered by society, which may also
be associated with extreme impacts on the physical environment and
on ecosystems. Building on the definition set out in Section 1.1.2.1,
extreme impacts resulting from weather, climate, or hydrological events
can become disasters once they surpass thresholds in at least one of
three dimensions: spatial — so that damages cannot be easily restored
from neighboring capacity; temporal — so that recovery becomes
frustrated by further damages; and intensity of impact on the affected
population — thereby undermining, although not necessarily eliminating,
the capacity of the society or community to repair itself (Alexander,
1993). However, for the purposes of tabulating occurrences, some
agencies only list ‘disasters’ when they exceed certain numbers of killed
or injured or total repair costs (Below et al., 2009; CRED, 2010).
"	Text
"Whether an extreme event results in extreme impacts on humans and
social systems depends on the degree of exposure and vulnerability to
that extreme, in addition to the magnitude of the physical event (high
confidence). Extreme impacts on human systems may be associated
with non-extreme events where vulnerability and exposure are high
(Sections 1.1.2.1 and 9.2.3). A key weather parameter may cross some
critical value at that location (such as that associated with heat wave-
induced mortality, or frost damage to crops), so that the distribution of
the impact shifts in a way that is disproportionate to physical changes
(see Section 4.2). A comprehensive assessment of projected impacts of
climate changes would consider how changes in atmospheric conditions
(temperature, precipitation) translate to impacts on physical (eg.,
droughts and floods, erosion of beaches and slopes, sea level rise),
ecological (e.g., forest fires), and human systems (eg., casualties,
infrastructure damages). For example, an extreme event with a large
spatial scale (as in an ice storm or windstorm) can have an exaggerated,
disruptive impact due to the systemic societal dependence on electricity
transmission and distribution networks (Peters et al., 2006). Links between
climate events and physical impacts are addressed in Section 3.5, while
links to ecosystems and human systems impacts are addressed in 4.3.
"	Text
"The aftermath of one extreme event may precondition the physical
impact of successor events. High groundwater levels and river flows can
persist for months, increasing the probability of a later storm causing
flooding, as on the Rhine in 1995 (Fink et al., 1996). A thickness reduction
in Arctic sea ice preconditions more extreme reductions in the summer
ice extent (Holland et al., 2006). A variety of feedbacks and other
interactions connect extreme events and physical system and ecological
responses in a way that may amplify physical impacts (Sections 3.1.4
and 4.3.5). For example, reductions in soil moisture can intensify heat
waves (Seneviratne et al., 2006), while droughts following rainy seasons
turn vegetation into fuel that can be consumed in wildfires (Westerling
and Swetman, 2003), which in turn promote soil runoff and landslides
when the rains return (Cannon et al., 2001). However, extremes can also
interact to reduce disaster risk. The wind-driven waves in a hurricane
bring colder waters to the surface from beneath the thermocline; for the
next month, any cyclone whose path follows too closely will have a
reduced potential maximum intensity (Emanuel, 2001). Intense rainfall
accompanying monsoons and hurricanes also brings great benefits to
society and ecosystems; on many occasions it helps to fill reservoirs,
sustain seasonal agriculture, and alleviate summer dry conditions in arid
Zones (e.g., Cavazos et al., 2008).

often finds it convenient to express risk as a product of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability (e.g., UNISDR, 2009e, 2011). In addition, the
decision sciences literature recognizes decision rules, useful in some circumstances, that do not depend on probability and consequence
as combined in Equation (1). For instance, if the estimates of probabilities are sufficiently imprecise, decisionmakers might use a criterion
that depends only on comparing estimates of potential consequences (e.g., mini-max regret, Savage, 1972).
"	Text
"For instance, the risk a community faces from flooding from a nearby river might be calculated based on the likelihood that the river floods
the town, inflicting casualties among inhabitants and disrupting the community's economic livelihood. This likelihood is multiplied by the
value people place on those casualties and economic disruption. Equation (1) provides a quantitative representation of the qualitative
definition of disaster risk given in Section 1.1. All three factors — hazard, exposure, and vulnerability — contribute to ‘consequences.’
Hazard and vulnerability can both contribute to the ‘probability’: the former to the likelihood of the physical event (e.g., the river flooding
the town) and the latter to the likelihood of the consequence resulting from the event (e.g., casualties and economic disruption).
"	Text
"In practice, probabilistic risk analysis is often not implemented in its pure form for reasons including data limitations; decision rules that
yield satisfactory results with less effort than that required by a full probabilistic risk assessment; the irreducible imprecision of some
estimates of important probabilities and consequences (see Sections 1.3.1.1 and 1.3.2); and the need to address the wide range of factors
that affect judgments about risk (see Box 1-3). In the above example, the water management agency is not performing a full probabilistic
risk analysis, but rather employing a hybrid decision rule in which it estimates that the consequences of running out of water would be
so large as to justify any reasonable investment needed to keep the likelihood of that event below the chosen probabilistic threshold.
Chapter 2 describes a variety of practical quantitative and qualitative approaches for allocating efforts to manage disaster risk.
"	Text
"When implemented within a broader risk governance framework, probabilistic risk analysis can help allocate and evaluate efforts to
manage risk. Equation (1) implies what the decision sciences literature (Morgan and Henrion, 1990) calls a decision rule — that is, a
criterion for ranking alternative sets of actions by their ability to reduce overall risk. For instance, an insurance company (as part of a risk
transfer effort) might set the annual price for flood insurance based on multiplying an estimate of the probability a dwelling would be
flooded in any given year by an estimate of the monetary losses such flooding would cause. Ideally, the premiums collected from the
residents of many dwellings would provide funds to compensate the residents of those few dwellings that are in fact flooded (and
defray administrative costs). In another example, a water management agency (as part of a risk reduction effort) might invest the
resources to build a reservoir of sufficient size so that, if the largest drought observed in their region over the last 100 years (or some
other timeframe) occurred again in the future, the agency would nonetheless be able to maintain a reliable supply of water.

In their original habitat, trees typically withstand wind extremes expected
every 10 to 50 years, but not extremes that lie beyond their average

such judgments about disaster management, risk reduction, and risk
transfer within this broader context. Risk governance, under Renn’‘s
(2008) formulation, consists of four phases — pre-assessment, appraisal,
characterization/evaluation, and management — in an open, cyclical,
iterative, and interlinked process. Risk communication accompanies all
four phases. This process is consistent with those in the UNISDR Hyogo

Probabilistic risk analysis also suggests that a series of relatively smaller,

buildings are constructed to the most stringent wind design code in the
world. Buildings are required to withstand peak gust wind speeds of

typically be highest at mid-latitudes while those expected once every

"As one component of its broader approach, risk governance uses
concepts from probabilistic risk analysis to help judge appropriate
allocations in level of effort and over time and among risk reduction,
risk transfer, and disaster management actions. The basic probabilistic
risk analytic framework for considering such allocations regards risk
as the product of the probability of an event(s) multiplied by its
consequence (see Box 1-2; Bedford and Cooke, 2001). In this formulation,
risk reduction aims to reduce exposure and vulnerability as well as the
probability of occurrence of some events (e.g., those associated with
landslides and forest fires induced by human intervention). Risk transfer
efforts aim to compensate losses suffered by those who directly experience
an event. Disaster management aims to respond to the immediate
consequences and facilitate reduction of longer-term consequences (see

event and the interaction of psychological, social, institutional, and

operating the plant and by views about potential linkages between
nuclear power and nuclear weapons proliferation — factors that may not

"A variety of cognitive, cultural, and social processes affect judgments about risk and about the allocation of efforts to address these
risks. In addition to the processes described in Section 1.3.1.2, subjective judgments may be influenced more by emotional reactions to
events (e.g., feelings of fear and loss of control) than by analytic assessments of their likelihood (Loewenstein et al., 2001). People
frequently ignore predictions of extreme events if those predictions fail to elicit strong emotional reactions, but will also overreact to
such forecasts when the events elicit feelings of fear or dread (Slovic et al., 1982; Slovic 1993, 2010; Weber, 2006). Even with sufficient
information, everyday concerns and satisfaction of basic wants may prove a more pressing concern than attention and effort toward
actions to address longer-term disaster risk (Maskrey, 1989, 2011; Wisner et al., 2004).

"Factual information interacts with social, institutional, and cultural processes in ways that may amplify or attenuate public perceptions of
risk and extreme events (Kasperson et al., 1988). The US public’s estimates of the risk of nuclear power following the accident at Three
Mile Island provide an example of the socio-cultural filtering of engineering safety data. Social amplification increased public perceptions
of the risk of nuclear power far beyond levels that would derive only from analysis of accident statistics (Fischhoff et al., 1983). The public's
transformation of expert-provided risk signals can serve as a corrective mechanism by which cultural subgroups of society augment a
science-based risk analysis with psychological risk dimensions not considered in technical risk assessments (Slovic, 2000). Evidence from
health, social psychology, and risk communication literature suggests that social and cultural risk amplification processes modify
perceptions of risk in either direction and in ways that may generally be socially adaptive, but can also bias reactions in socially
undesirable ways in specific instances (APA, 2009).

"In addition to being influenced by cognitive shortcuts (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979), the perceptions of risk and extremes and reactions
to such risk and events are also shaped by motivational processes (Weber, 2010). Cultural theory combines insights from anthropology
and political science to provide a conceptual framework and body of empirical studies that seek to explain societal conflict over risk
(Douglas, 1992). People’s worldview and political ideology guide attention toward events that threaten their desired social order
(Douglas and Wildavsky, 1982). Risk in this framework is defined as the disruption of a social equilibrium. Personal beliefs also influence
which sources of expert forecasts of extreme climate events will be trusted. Different cultural groups put their trust into different
organizations, from national meteorological services to independent farm organizations to the IPCC; depending on their values, beliefs,
and corresponding mental models, people will be receptive to different types of interventions (Dunlap and McCright, 2008; Malka and
Krosnick, 2009). Judgments about the veracity of information regarding the consequences of alternative actions often depend on the
perceived consistency of those actions with an individual's cultural values, so that individuals will be more willing to consider information
about consequences that can be addressed with actions seen as consistent with their values (Kahan and Braman, 2006; Kahan et al., 2007).

"The likelihood of extreme events is most commonly described by the
return period, the mean interval expected between one such event and its
recurrence. For example, one might speak of a 100-year flood or a 50-year
windstorm. More formally, these intervals are inversely proportional to
the ‘annual exceedance probability,’ the likelihood that an event
exceeding some magnitude occurs in any given year. Thus the 100-year
flood has a 1% chance of occurring in any given year (which translates
into a 37% chance of a century passing without at least one such flood
((1-0.01)'00 = 37%). Though statistical methods exist to estimate
frequencies longer than available data time series (Milly et al., 2002),

Projecting future vulnerability and response capacity involves predicting
the trends and changes in underlying causes of human vulnerability and
the behavior of complex human systems under potentially stressful and
novel conditions. For instance, disaster risk is endogenous in the sense that
near-term actions to manage risk may affect future risk in unintended
ways and near-term actions may affect perceptions of future risks (see
Box 1-3). Section 1.4 describes some of the challenges such system
complexity may pose for effective risk assessment. In addition, disasters
affect socioeconomic systems in multiple ways so that assigning a
quantitative value to the consequences of a disaster proves difficult (see
Section 1.2.3.3). The literature distinguishes between direct losses,
which are the immediate consequences of the disaster-related physical
events, and indirect losses, which are the consequences that result from
the disruption of life and activity after the immediate impacts of the
event (Pelling et al., 2002; Lindell and Prater, 2003; Cochrane, 2004; Rose,
2004). Section 1.3.2 discusses some means to address these challenges.

"Climate change will pose added challenges in many cases for attaining
disaster risk management goals, and appropriately allocating efforts to
manage disaster risks, for at least two sets of reasons. First, as discussed in
Chapters 3 and 4, climate change is very likely to increase the occurrence
and vary the location of some physical events, which in turn will affect
the exposure faced by many communities, as well as their vulnerability.
Increased exposure and vulnerability would contribute to an increase in
disaster risk. For example, vulnerability may increase due to direct climate-
related impacts on the development and development potential of the
affected area, because resources otherwise available and directed
towards development goals are deflected to respond to those impacts,
or because long-standing institutions for allocating resources such as
water no longer function as intended if climate change affects the
scarcity and distribution of that resource. Second, climate change will
make it more difficult to anticipate, evaluate, and communicate both
probabilities and consequences that contribute to disaster risk, in
particular that associated with extreme events. This set of issues,

"To address these challenges, the adaptation literature has increasingly

that the process of anticipating and responding to climate change does
not constitute a single set of judgments at some point in time, but rather
an ongoing assessment, action, reassessment, and response that will
continue — in the case of many climate-related decisions — indefinitely

conditions where the probabilities underlying estimates of future risk
are imprecise and/or the structure of the models that relate events to

tools. In particular, any estimates of changes in disaster risk due to
climate change are often based on the results of complex climate
models as described in Chapter 3. Non-experts, on the other hand, rely
to a greater extent on more readily available and more easily processed
information, such as their own experiences or vicarious experiences from
the stories communicated through the news media, as well as their
subjective judgment as to the importance of such events (see Box 1-1).

"Quantitative methods based on probabilistic risk analysis, such as those
described in Sections 5.5 and 6.3, can allow people operating in expert
contexts to use observed data, often from long time series, to make
systematic and internally consistent estimates of the probability of
future events. As described in Section 1.3.1.1, climate change may
reduce the accuracy of such past observations as predictors for future
risk. Individuals, including non-experts and experts making estimates
without the use of formal methods (Barke et al., 1997), often predict the
likelihood of encountering an event in the future by consulting their
past experiences with such events. The ‘availability’ heuristic (i.e., useful
shortcut) is commonly applied, in which the likelihood of an event is
judged by the ease with which past instances can be brought to mind
(Tversky and Kahneman, 1974). Extreme events, by definition, have a
low probability of being represented in past experience and thus will be
relatively unavailable. Experts and non-experts alike may essentially
ignore such events until they occur, as in the case of a 100-year flood
(Hertwig et al., 2004). When extreme events do occur with severe and
thus memorable consequences, people’s estimates of their future risks
will, at least temporarily, become inflated (Weber et al., 2004).

"The disaster risk management community can benefit from the debates
in the adaptation literature about how to best incorporate information
about current and future climate into climate-related decisions. Some

has been criticized on the grounds that predictions of future climate

this situation would go a long way toward preparing them for any

"The resilience literature, as described in Chapter 8, also takes an interest
in managing difficult-to-predict futures. Both the adaptation to climate

(Wisner et al., 2004; McLaughlin and Dietz, 2007; Nelson et al., 2007;
Moser 2009) that focuses on particular agents faced with a set of
decisions who can make choices based on their various preferences;
their institutional interests, power, and capabilities; and the information
they have available. Robustness in the adaptation to climate change
context often refers to a property of decisions specific actors may take

These literatures can help highlight for disaster risk management such
issues as the tension between resilience to specific, known disturbances
and novel and unexpected ones (sometimes referred to as the distinction

tension between resilience at different spatial and temporal scales, and

"Recent literature has thus explored a variety of approaches that can
help disaster risk management address such uncertainties (McGray et
al., 2007; IIED 2009; Schipper, 2009), in particular approaches that help
support decisions when it proves difficult or impossible to accurately
estimate probabilities of events and their adverse consequences.
Approaches for characterizing uncertainty include qualitative scenario
methods (Parson et al., 2007); fuzzy sets (Chongfu, 1996; El-Baroudy
and Simonovic, 2004; Karimi and Hullermeier, 2007; Simonovic, 2010);
and the use of ranges of values or sets of distributions, rather than single
values or single best-estimate distributions (Morgan et al., 2009; see
also Mastrandrea et al., 2010). Others have suggested managing such
uncertainty with robust policies that perform well over a wide range of
plausible futures (Dessai and Hulme, 2007; Groves and Lempert, 2007;
Brown, 2010; Means et al., 2010; Wilby and Dessai, 2010; Dessai and
Wilby, 2011; Reeder and Ranger, 2011; also see discussion in Chapter 8).
Decision rules based on the concept of robust adaptive policies go
beyond ‘no regrets’ by suggesting how in some cases relatively low-
cost, near-term actions and explicit plans to adjust those actions over
time can significantly improve future ability to manage risk (World
Bank, 2009; Hine and Hall, 2010; Lempert and Groves, 2010; Walker et

"Disaster risk management will find similarities to its own multi-sector
approach in the adaptation literature’s recent emphasis, consistent with
the concept of climate-related decisions, on climate change as one of
many factors affecting the management of risks. For instance, some
resource management agencies now stress climate change as one of many
trends such as growing demand for resources, environmental constraints,
aging infrastructure, and technological change that, particularly in
combination, could require changes in investment plans and business
models (CCSP, 2008; Brick et al., 2010). It has become clear that many
less-developed regions will have limited success in reducing overall
vulnerability solely by managing climate risk because vulnerability,
adaptive capacity, and exposure are critically influenced by existing
structural deficits (low income and high inequality, lack of access to
health and education, lack of security and political access, etc.). For
example, in drought-ravaged northeastern Brazil, many vulnerable
households could not take advantage of risk management interventions
such as seed distribution programs because they lacked money to travel
to pick up the seeds or could not afford a day’s lost labor to participate
in the program (Lemos, 2003). In Burkina Faso, farmers had limited
ability to use seasonal forecasts (a risk management strategy) because
they lacked the resources (basic agricultural technology such as plows,
alternative crop varieties, fertilizers, etc.) needed to effectively respond
to the projections (Ingram et al., 2002). In Bangladesh, however, despite
persisting poverty, improved disaster preparedness and response and
relative higher levels of household adaptive capacity have dramatically
decreased the number of deaths as a result of flooding (del Ninno et al.,

other responses considered when confronted with sea level change can

"Because climate variability occurs over a wide range of timescales, there is often a historical record of previous efforts to manage and
adapt to climate-related risk that is relevant to risk management under climate change. These efforts provide a basis for learning via
the assessment of responses, interventions, and recovery from previous impacts. Although efforts to incorporate learning into the
management of weather- and climate-related risks have not always succeeded, such adaptive approaches constitute a plausible model
for longer-term efforts. Learning is most effective when it leads to evaluation of disaster risk management strategies, particularly with
regard to the allocation of resources and efforts between risk reduction, risk sharing, and disaster response and recovery efforts, and
when it engages a wide range of stakeholder groups, particularly affected communities.

"Both fields share a common interest in understanding and reducing the
risk created by the interactions of human with physical and biological
systems. Both seek appropriate allocations of risk reduction, risk
transfer, and disaster management efforts, for instance balancing pre-
impact risk management or adaptation with post-impact response and
recovery. Decisions in both fields may be organized according to the
risk governance framework. For instance, many countries, are gaining
experience in implementing cooperative, inter-sector and multi- or
interdisciplinary approaches (ICSU, 2002; Brown et al., 2006; McGray et
al., 2007; Lavell and Lavell, 2009). In general, disaster risk management
can help those practicing adaptation to climate change to learn from
addressing current impacts. Adaptation to climate change can help
those practicing disaster risk management to more effectively address
future conditions that will differ from those of today.

by other persistent and recurrent hazards (Wisner et al., 2004, 2011;
Lavell, 2010; Mercer, 2010). Additionally, learning from disaster risk
management can help adaptation, which to date has focused more on
changes in the climate mean, increasing its focus on future changes in
climate extremes and other potentially damaging events.
"	Text
"A key conclusion of this section is that learning is central to adaptation,
and that there are abundant examples (see Section 1.4.5 and Chapter 9)
of the disaster risk management community learning from prior experience
and adjusting its practices to respond to a wide range of existing and
evolving hazards. These cases provide the adaptation to climate change
community with the opportunity not only to study the specifics of learning
as outlined in these cases, but also to reflect on how another community
that also addresses climate-related risk has incorporated learning into
its practice over time.

"Second, disaster risk management has tended to encourage an expanded,
bottom-up, grass roots approach, emphasizing local and community-
based risk management in the framework of national management
systems (see Chapters 5 and 6), while an important segment of the
adaptation literature focuses on social and economic sectors and macro
ecosystems over large regional scales. However, a large body of the
adaptation literature — in both developed and developing countries — is
very locally focused. Both fields could benefit from the body of work on
the determinants of adaptive capacity that focus on the interaction of
individual and collective action and institutions that frame their actions
(McGray et al., 2007; Schipper, 2009).
"	Text
"Third, the current disaster risk management literature emphasizes the
social conditioning of risk and the construction of vulnerability as a causal
factor in explaining loss and damage. Early adaptation literature and
some more recent output, particularly from the climate change field,
prioritizes physical events and exposure, seeing vulnerability as what
remains after all other factors have been considered (O’Brien et al.,
2007). However, community-based adaptation work in developing
countries (Beer and Hamilton, 2002; Brown et al., 2006; Lavell and
Lavell, 2009; UNISDR, 2009b,c) and a growing number of studies in
developed nations (Burby and Nelson, 1991; de Bruin et al. 2009;
Bedsworth and Hanak, 2010; Brody et al., 2010; Corfee-Morlot et al.,

"Overall, the disaster risk management and adaptation to climate change
literatures both now emphasize the value of a more holistic, integrated,
trans-disciplinary approach to risk management (ICSU-LAC, 2009).
Dividing the world up sectorally and thematically has often proven
organizationally convenient in government and academia, but can
undermine a thorough understanding of the complexity and interaction
of the human and physical factors involved in the constitution and
definition of a problem at different social, temporal, and territorial
scales. A more integrated approach facilitates recognition of the complex
relationships among diverse social, temporal, and spatial contexts;
highlights the importance of decision processes that employ participatory
methods and decentralization within a supporting hierarchy of higher
levels; and emphasizes that many disaster risk management and other

"In order to clarify this aspect, it is helpful first to look outside of the
disaster risk and adaptation contexts. The Oxford English Dictionary

such distinctions carries operational significance for decisionmakers
interested in promoting resilience, a process that relies on coping for
immediate survival and recovery, as well as adaptation and disaster
risk reduction, which entail integrating new information to moderate
potential future harm.
"	Text
"The definitions of coping and adapting used in this report reflect the
dictionary definitions. As an example, a community cannot adapt its way
through the aftermath of a disastrous hurricane; it must cope instead.
Its coping capacity, or capacity to respond (Gallopin, 2003), is a function
of currently available resources that can be used to cope, and determines
the community's ability to survive the disaster intact (Bankoff, 2004;
Wisner et al., 2004). Repeated use of coping mechanisms without
adequate time and provisions for recovery can reduce coping capacity
and shift a community into what has been termed transient poverty
(Lipton and Ravallion, 1995). Rather than leaving resources for adaptation,
communities forced to cope can become increasingly vulnerable to
future hazards (O’Brien and Leichenko, 2000).

"In both the disaster risk management and climate change adaptation
literature, substantial differences are apparent as to the meaning and
significance of coping as well as its relationship with and distinction
from adaptation. Among the discrepancies, for example, some disaster
risk management scholars have referred to coping as a way to engage
local populations and utilize indigenous knowledge in disaster
preparedness and response (Twigg, 2004), while others have critiqued this
idea, concerned that it would divert attention away from addressing
structural problems (Davies, 1993) and lead to a focus on ‘surviving’
instead of ‘thriving.’ There has also been persistent debate over whether
coping primarily occurs before or after a disastrous event (UNISDR,
2008b,c, 2009e). This debate is not entirely resolved by the current
UNISDR definition of coping, the “ability of people, organizations, and
systems, using available skills and resources, to face and manage
adverse conditions, emergencies or disasters” (UNISDR, 2009d). Clearly,
emergencies and disasters are post facto circumstances, but ‘adverse
conditions’ is an indeterminate concept that could include negative pre-
impact livelihood conditions and disaster risk circumstances or merely
post-impact effects.

likely to survive and thrive when adaptation efforts have matched its
coping range with the range of hazards it typically encounters (Smit and
Pilifosova, 2003). As climate change alters future variability and the
occurrence of extreme events, and as societal trends change human
systems’ vulnerability, adaptation is required to adjust the coping range
so as to maintain societal functioning within an expected or acceptable
range of risk (Moser and Luers, 2008).

Yohe and Tol (2002, p. 26) have used the term to refer to the range of
“circumstances within which, by virtue of the underlying resilience of
the system, significant consequences are not observed” in response to
external stressors. Outside the coping range, communities will “feel
significant effects from change and/or variability in their environments”

"After the major investment in raising and strengthening flood defenses in the 17th century, there were two or three large floods, one in
1717 (when 14,000 people drowned) and two notable floods in 1825 and 1953; since that time the average flood mortality rate has
been around 1,000 per century, equivalent to a lifetime mortality rate (assuming a 50-year average lifetime) of around 0.01%, 500 times
lower than that which had prevailed through the Middle Ages (Van Baars and Van Kempen, 2009). This change reflects increased protection
rather than any reduction in storminess. The flood hazard and attendant risk is now considered to be rising again (Bouwer and Vellinga,
2007) and plans are being developed to manage further rises, shifting the coping range in anticipation of the new hazard distribution.

"Before AD 1000, in the low-lying coastal floodplain of the southern North Sea and around the Rhine delta, the area that is now The
Netherlands, the inhabitants lived on dwelling mounds, piled up to lie above the height of the majority of extreme storm surges. By the
10th century, with a population estimated at 300,000 people, inhabitants had begun to construct the first dikes, and within 400 years
had ringed all significant areas of land above spring tide, allowing animals to graze and people to live in the protected wetlands. The
expansion of habitable land encouraged a significant increase in the population exposed to catastrophic floods (Borger and Ligtendag,
1998). The weak sea dikes broke in a series of major storm surge floods through the stormy 13th and 14th centuries (in particular in
1212, 1219, 1287, and 1362), flooding enormous areas (often permanently) and causing more than 200,000 fatalities, reflecting an
estimated lifetime mortality rate from floods for those living in the region in excess of 5% (assuming a 30-year average lifespan;

"To adapt to increasingly adverse environmental conditions (reflecting long-term delta subsidence), major improvements in the technology
of dike construction and drainage engineering began in the 15th century. As the country became richer and population increased (to an
estimated 950,000 by 1500 and 1.9 million by 1700), it became an imperative not only to provide better levels of protection but also to
reclaim land from the sea and from the encroaching lakes, both to reduce flood hazard and expand the land available for food production
(Hoeksma, 2006). Examples of the technological innovations included the development of windmills for pumping, and methods to lift
water at least 4 m whether by running windmills in series or through the use of the wind-powered Archimedes screw. As important was
the availability of capital to be invested in joint stock companies with the sole purpose of land reclamation. In 1607, a company was
formed to reclaim the 72 km2 Beemster Lake north of Amsterdam (12 times larger than any previous reclamation). A 50-km canal and
dike ring were excavated, a total of 50 windmills installed that after five years pumped dry the Beemster polder, 3 to 4 m below the
surrounding countryside, which, within 30 years, had been settled by 200 farmhouses and 2,000 people.

are more resilient than others. The most resilient are characterized by
their capacity to learn and adjust, their ability to reorganize after
disruption, and their retention of fundamental structure and function in
the face of system stress (Folke, 2006). The ability to cope with extreme
stress and resume normal function is thus an important component of
resilience, but learning, reorganizing, and changing over time are also
key. As Chapter 8 highlights, transformational changes are required to
achieve a future in which society’s most important social-ecological

(List, 2006). Prior work on learning theories, for example, experiential
learning (Kolb, 1984) and transformative learning (Mezirow, 1995),
emphasize the importance of action-oriented problem-solving, learning-
by-doing, concrete learning cycles, and how these processes result in
reflection, reconsideration of meaning, and re-interpretation of value
structures. The learning loop framework (Kolb and Fry, 1975; Argyris and
Schon, 1978; Keen et al., 2005) integrates these theories and divides
learning processes into three different loops depending on the degree
to which the learning promotes transformational change in management
strategies. Figure 1-3 outlines this framework and its application to the
issue of flood management.

"In single-loop learning processes, changes are made based on the
difference between what is expected and what is observed. Single-loop
learning is primarily focused on improving the efficiency of action
(Pelling et al., 2008) and answering the question of “whether things are
being done right” (Flood and Romm, 1996), that is, whether management
tactics are appropriate or adequate to achieve identified objectives. In
flood management, for example, when floodwaters threaten to breach
existing flood defenses, flood managers may ask whether dike and
levee heights are sufficient and make adjustments accordingly. As
Figure 1-3 indicates, single-loop learning focuses primarily on actions;
data are integrated and acted on but the underlying mental model used
to process the data is not changed.
"	Text
"Easier said than done, triple-loop learning is analogous to what some
have termed ‘transformation’ (Kysar, 2004; see Section 1.1.3; Chapter
8), in that it can lead to recasting social structures, institutions, and
constructions that contain and mediate risk to accommodate more
fundamental changes in world view (Pelling, 2010). Translating double-
and triple-loop learning into policy requires not only articulation of
a larger risk-benefit universe, but also mechanisms to identify,
account for, and compare the costs associated with a wide range of
interventions and their benefits and harms over various time horizons.
Stakeholders would need also to collaborate to an unusual degree in
order to collectively and cooperatively consider the wide range of risk
management possibilities and their impacts.

"Different types of learning are more or less appropriate in given
circumstances (Pahl-Wostl, 2009, p. 359). For example, overreliance
on single-loop learning may be problematic in rapidly changing
circumstances. Single-loop learning draws on an inventory of existing
skills and memories specific to particular circumstances. As a result,
rapid, abrupt, or surprising changes may confound single-loop learning
processes (Batterbury, 2008). Coping mechanisms, even those that
have developed over long periods of time and been tested against
observation and experience, may not confer their usual survival
advantage in new contexts. Double- and triple-loop learning are better
suited to matching coping ranges with new hazard regimes (Yohe and
Tol, 2002). Integrating double- and triple-loop learning into adaptation
projects, particularly for populations exposed to multiple risks and
stressors, is more effective than more narrowly planned approaches
dependent on specific future climate information (McGray et al., 2007;
Pettengell, 2010).
"	Text
"In double-loop learning, the evaluation is extended to assess whether
actors are “doing the right things” (Flood and Romm, 1996), that is,
whether management goals and strategies are appropriate. Corrective
actions are made after the problem is reframed and different management
goals are identified (Pelling et al., 2008); data are used to promote
critical thinking and challenge underlying mental models of what works
and why. Continuing with the flood management example, double-loop
learning results when the goals of the current flood management
regime are critically examined to determine if the regime is sustainable
and resilient to anticipated shifts in hydrological extremes over a
particular time period. For instance, in a floodplain protected by levees
built to withstand a 500-year flood, a shift in the annual exceedance
probability from 0.002 to 0.005 (equivalent to stating that the likelihood
that a 500-year flood will occur in a given year has shifted to that seen
historically for a 200-year event) will prompt questions about whether
the increased likelihood of losses justifies different risk management
decisions, ranging from increased investments in flood defenses to
changed insurance policies for the vulnerable populations.

in identifying the origin of maladaptive decisions, crafting truly adaptive

include difficulty recognizing a changing signal due to difficulty with its

While this study offers a diagnostic framework and avoids prescriptions
about overcoming adaptation barriers, other studies, such as those
mentioned above, offer more focused prescriptions relevant to particular
sectors and contexts.

"This example illustrates how an adaptation barrier may have resulted in
an ultimately maladaptive risk management regime, and demonstrates
the importance of considering how risk, in practice, is assumed and
shared. One goal of risk sharing is to properly price risk so that, in the
event risk is realized, there is an adequate pool of capital available to
fund recovery. When risk is improperly priced and risk sharing is not
adequately regulated, as can occur when risk-sharing devices are not
monitored appropriately, an adequate pool of reserves may not
accumulate. When risk is realized, the responsibility for funding the
recovery falls to the insurer of last resort, often the public.

fallible, ultimately leading to increased risk, and advocated, among
other ‘adjustment’ measures, land use planning and environmental
management schemes in river basins in order to face up to flooding
hazards (see Burton et al., 1978). Such findings are among the early
advances in the field of ‘human adjustment to hazards,’ which derived
from an ecological approach to human-environmental relationships. In
the case of levees for example, the distinction between adaptive and
maladaptive actions depends on the time period over which risks are
being assessed. From a probabilistic perspective, the overall likelihood
of a catastrophic flood overwhelming a levee's protective capacity is a
function of time. The wrinkle that climate change introduces is that
many climate-related hazards may become more frequent, shrinking the
timescale over which certain decisions can be considered ‘adaptive’ and
communities can consider themselves ‘adapted’ (Nelson et al., 2007).

"as risk pricing in insurance schemes) are inadequately maintained, or if
new risk management strategies are not recruited as necessary. This
was the case with the levees in New Orleans prior to Hurricane Katrina,
wherein the levees were built to make a hazardous area safer but
paradoxically facilitated the exposure of a much larger population to a
large hazard. As a result of multiple factors (Burby, 2006), inadequate
levee infrastructure increased the likelihood of flooding but no other
adequate risk reduction and management measures were implemented,
resulting in catastrophic loss of life and property when the city was hit
with the surge from a strong Category 3 storm (Comfort, 2006). Some have
suggested that, as a result of the U.S. federal government's historical
approach to disasters, those whose property was at risk in New Orleans
anticipated that they would receive federal recovery funds in the event of
a flooding disaster. This, in turn, may have distorted the risk management
landscape, resulting in improper pricing of flooding risks, decreased
incentives to take proper risk management actions, and exposure of a
larger population to flood risk than might otherwise have been the case
(Kunreuther, 2006).

"Research on barriers has generally focused on adaptation as a process,
recognizing the difficulty in furnishing a universally acceptable a priori
definition of successful adaptation outcomes (Adger et al., 2005). This
skirts potentially important normative questions, however, and some
researchers have considered whether particular activities should be
considered maladaptive, defined as an “action taken ostensibly to avoid
or reduce vulnerability to climate change that impacts adversely on,
or increases the vulnerability of other systems, sectors, or social
groups” (Barnett and O'Neill, 2009, p. 211). They identify activities
that increase greenhouse gas releases, burden vulnerable populations
disproportionately, and require excessive commitment to one path of
action (Barnett and O'Neill, 2009). Other candidates include actions that
offset one set of risks but increase others, resulting in net risk increase,
for example, a dam that reduces flooding but increases the threat of
Zoonotic diseases, and actions that amplify risk to those who remain
exposed (or are newly exposed as a result of a maladaptive action), of
which there are abundant examples in the public health literature
(Sterman, 2006) and other fields.
"	Text
"The example also illustrates how an insurance system designed to
motivate adaptation (by individual homeowners or flood protection
agencies) can function properly only if technical rates — rates that properly
reflect empirically determined levels of risk — can be established and
matched with various levels of risk at a relatively high level of spatial
and temporal resolution. Even in countries with free-market flood
insurance systems, insurers may be reluctant to charge the full technical
rate because consumers have come to assume that insurance costs
should be relatively consistent in a given location. Without charging
technical rates, however, it is difficult to use pricing to motivate adaptation
strategies such as flood proofing or elevating the ground floor of a new
development (Lamond et al., 2009), restricting where properties can be
built, or justifying the construction of communal flood defenses. In such
a case, barriers to adaptation (in both planning and management, in
this case) can result in a strategy with maladaptive consequences in the
present. In places where risk levels are rising due to climate change
under prevailing negative conditions of exposure and vulnerability,
reconsideration of these barriers — a process that includes double- and
triple-loop learning — could promote more adaptive risk management.
Otherwise, maladaptive risk management decisions may commit collective
resources (public or private) to coping and recovery rather than successful
adaptation and may force some segments of society to cope with
disproportionate levels of risk.

"As Section 1.4.3 highlights, currently, in many instances risks associated
with extreme weather and other climate-sensitive hazards are often not
well managed. To be effective, adaptation would prioritize measures
that increase current as well as future resilience to threats. Robustness
over time would increase if learning were a central pillar of adaptation
efforts, including learning focused on addressing current vulnerabilities
and enhancing current risk management (high confidence). Single-,
double-, and triple-loop learning will all improve the efficacy of
management strategies.
"	Text
"The mismatch between adaptation strategies and projected needs has
been characterized as the potential for regret, that is, opportunity costs
associated with decisions (and related path dependence, wherein earlier
choices constrain future circumstances and decisions) that are optimal
for one or a small number of possible climate futures but not necessarily
robust over a wider range of scenarios (Lempert and Schlesinger, 2001).
‘No regrets’ adaptation refers to decisions that have net benefits over
the entire range of anticipated future climate and associated impacts
(Callaway and Hellmuth, 2007; Heltberg et al., 2009).
"	Text
"To address the challenge of risk management in the dynamically
complex context of climate change and development, as well as under
conditions where probabilistic estimates of future climatic conditions
remain imprecise, several authors have advanced the concept of
robustness (Wilby and Dessai, 2010), of which ‘no regrets’ adaptation is
a special case (Lempert and Groves, 2010). Robustness is a property of
a plan or strategy that performs well over a wide range of plausible
future scenarios even if it does not perform optimally in any particular
scenario. Robust adaptation plans may perform relatively well even if
probabilistic assessments of risk prove wrong because they aim to
address both expected and surprising changes, and may allow diverse
stakeholders to agree on actions even if they disagree about values and
expectations (Brown and Lall, 2006; Dessai and Hulme; 2007; Lempert
and Groves, 2010; Means et al., 2010; see also Section 1.3.2).
"	Text
"The case studies in Chapter 9 highlight some important examples of
learning in disaster risk management relevant to a wide range of climate-
sensitive threats and a variety of sectors. Section 9.2 provides examples
of how single- and double-loop learning processes — enhancing public
health response capacity, augmenting early warning systems, and
applying known strategies for protecting health from the threat of
extreme heat in new settings — had demonstrable impacts on heat-
related mortality, quickly shifting a region’s coping range with regard to
extreme heat (Section 9.2.1). Other case studies, examining risk transfer
(Section 9.2.13) and early warning systems (Section 9.2.11), provide
instances of how existing methods and tools can be modified and
deployed in new settings in response to changing risk profiles — examples
of both double- and triple-loop learning. Similarly, the case studies on
governance (Section 9.2.12) and on the limits to adaptation in small
island developing states (Section 9.2.9) provide examples of third-loop
learning and transformative approaches to disaster risk management.

"High vulnerability and exposure are generally the outcome of skewed development processes, such as
those associated with environmental mismanagement, demographic changes, rapid and unplanned

"	Text
"Vulnerability and exposure are dynamic, varying across temporal and spatial scales, and depend on economic,
social, geographic, demographic, cultural, institutional, governance, and environmental factors (high
confidence). [2.2, 2.3, 2.5] Individuals and communities are differentially exposed and vulnerable and this is based
on factors such as wealth, education, race/ethnicity/religion, gender, age, class/caste, disability, and health status. [2.5]
Lack of resilience and capacity to anticipate, cope with, and adapt to extremes and change are important causal factors
of vulnerability. [2.4]

"The severity of the impacts of extreme and non-extreme weather and climate events depends strongly on
the level of vulnerability and exposure to these events (high confidence). [2.2.1, 2.3, 2.5] Trends in vulnerability
and exposure are major drivers of changes in disaster risk, and of impacts when risk is realized (high confidence). [2.5]
Understanding the multi-faceted nature of vulnerability and exposure is a prerequisite for determining how weather
and climate events contribute to the occurrence of disasters, and for designing and implementing effective adaptation
and disaster risk management strategies. [2.2, 2.6]
"	Text
"Appropriate and timely risk communication is critical for effective adaptation and disaster risk management
(high confidence). Effective risk communication is built on risk assessment, and tailored to a specific audience, which
may range from decisionmakers at various levels of government, to the private sector and the public at large, including
local communities and specific social groups. Explicit characterization of uncertainty and complexity strengthens risk
communication. Impediments to information flows and limited awareness are risk amplifiers. Beliefs, values, and
norms influence risk perceptions, risk awareness, and choice of action. [2.6.3]
"	Text
"The selection of appropriate vulnerability and risk evaluation approaches depends on the decisionmaking
context (high confidence). [2.6.1] Vulnerability and risk assessment methods range from global and national
quantitative assessments to local-scale qualitative participatory approaches. The appropriateness of a specific method
depends on the adaptation or risk management issue to be addressed, including for instance the time and geographic
scale involved, the number and type of actors, and economic and governance aspects. Indicators, indices, and
probabilistic metrics are important measures and techniques for vulnerability and risk analysis. However, quantitative
approaches for assessing vulnerability need to be complemented with qualitative approaches to capture the full
complexity and the various tangible and intangible aspects of vulnerability in its different dimensions. [2.6]
"	Text
"Extreme and non-extreme weather and climate events also affect vulnerability to future extreme events,
by modifying the resilience, coping, and adaptive capacity of communities, societies, or social-ecological
systems affected by such events (high confidence). [2.4.3] At the far end of the spectrum — low-probability, high-
intensity events — the intensity of extreme climate and weather events and exposure to them tend to be more pervasive
in explaining disaster loss than vulnerability in explaining the level of impact. But for less extreme events — higher
probability, lower intensity — the vulnerability of exposed elements plays an increasingly important role (high
confidence). [2.3] The cumulative effects of small- or medium-scale, recurrent disasters at the sub-national or local
levels can substantially affect livelihood options and resources and the capacity of societies and communities to
prepare for and respond to future disasters. [2.2.1, 2.7]

"Vulnerability reduction is a core common element of adaptation and disaster risk management (high
confidence). Vulnerability reduction thus constitutes an important common ground between the two areas of policy

"climate change can be strengthened by including storylines of changing vulnerability and exposure under different
development pathways. Appropriate attention to the temporal and spatial dynamics of vulnerability and exposure is
particularly important given that the design and implementation of adaptation and risk management strategies and
policies can reduce risk in the short term, but may increase vulnerability and exposure over the longer term. For
instance, dike systems can reduce hazard exposure by offering immediate protection, but also encourage settlement
patterns that may increase risk in the long term. [2.4.2.1, 2.5.4.2, 2.6.2]

Hazard, Exposure, and Vulnerability

"Vulnerability refers to the propensity of exposed elements such as
human beings, their livelihoods, and assets to suffer adverse effects
when impacted by hazard events (UNDRO, 1980; Cardona, 1986, 1990,
"	Text
"Disaster risk is not fixed but is a continuum in constant evolution. A
disaster is one of its many ‘moments’ (ICSU-LAC, 2010a,b), signifying
unmanaged risks that often serve to highlight skewed development
problems (Westgate and O'Keefe, 1976; Wijkman and Timberlake, 1984).
Disasters may also be seen as the materialization of risk and signify ‘a
becoming real’ of this latent condition that is in itself a social construction
(see below; Renn, 1992; Adam and Van Loon, 2000; Beck, 2000, 2008).
"	Text
"Disaster risk signifies the possibility of adverse effects in the future. It
derives from the interaction of social and environmental processes, from
the combination of physical hazards and the vulnerabilities of exposed
elements (see Chapter 1). The hazard event is not the sole driver of risk,
and there is high confidence that the levels of adverse effects are in
good part determined by the vulnerability and exposure of societies and
social-ecological systems (UNDRO, 1980; Cuny, 1984; Cardona, 1986,
1993, 2011; Davis and Wall, 1992; UNISDR, 2004, 2009b; Birkmann,
2006a,b; van Aalst 2006a).
"	Text
"Land use and territorial planning are key factors in risk reduction. The
environment offers resources for human development at the same
time as it represents exposure to intrinsic and fluctuating hazardous
conditions. Population dynamics, diverse demands for location, and
the gradual decrease in the availability of safer lands mean it is
almost inevitable that humans and human endeavor will be located in
potentially dangerous places (Lavell, 2003). Where exposure to events is
impossible to avoid, land use planning and location decisions can be
accompanied by other structural or non-structural methods for preventing
or mitigating risk (UNISDR, 2009a; ICSU-LAC, 2010a,b).
"	Text
"Disaster risk is associated with differing levels and types of adverse
effects. The effects may assume catastrophic levels or levels commensurate
with small disasters. Some have limited financial costs but very high
human costs in terms of loss of life and numbers of people affected;
others have very high financial costs but relatively limited human costs.
Furthermore, there is high confidence that the cumulative effects of
small disasters can affect capacities of communities, societies, or social-
ecological systems to deal with future disasters at sub-national or local
levels (Alexander, 1993, 2000; Quarantelli, 1998; Birkmann, 2006b;
Marulanda et al., 2008b, 2010, 2011; UNISDR, 2009a).
"	Text
"Exposure refers to the inventory of elements in an area in which hazard
events may occur (Cardona, 1990; UNISDR, 2004, 2009b). Hence, if
population and economic resources were not located in (exposed to)
potentially dangerous settings, no problem of disaster risk would exist.
While the literature and common usage often mistakenly conflate
exposure and vulnerability, they are distinct. Exposure is a necessary,
but not sufficient, determinant of risk. It is possible to be exposed
but not vulnerable (for example by living in a floodplain but having
sufficient means to modify building structure and behavior to mitigate
potential loss). However, to be vulnerable to an extreme event, it is
necessary to also be exposed.
"	Text
"Many climate change adaptation efforts aim to address the implications
of potential changes in the frequency, intensity, and duration of weather
and climate events that affect the risk of extreme impacts on human
society. That risk is determined not only by the climate and weather
events (the hazards) but also by the exposure and vulnerability to these
hazards. Therefore, effective adaptation and disaster risk management
strategies and practices also depend on a rigorous understanding of the
dimensions of exposure and vulnerability, as well as a proper assessment
of changes in those dimensions. This chapter aims to provide that
understanding and assessment, by further detailing the determinants of
risk as presented in Chapter 1.
"	Text
"As detailed in Section 1.1, hazard refers to the possible, future occurrence
of natural or human-induced physical events that may have adverse
effects on vulnerable and exposed elements (White, 1973; UNDRO,
1980; Cardona, 1990; UNDHA, 1992; Birkmann, 2006b). Although, at
times, hazard has been ascribed the same meaning as risk, currently it
is widely accepted that it is a component of risk and not risk itself.
The intensity or recurrence of hazard events can be partly determined
by environmental degradation and human intervention in natural
ecosystems. Landslides or flooding regimes associated with human-
induced environmental alteration and new climate change-related
hazards are examples of such socio-natural hazards (Lavell, 1996,
1999a).
"	Text
"The first sections of this chapter elucidate the concepts that are needed
to define and understand risk, and show that risk originates from a
combination of social processes and their interaction with the environment
(Sections 2.2 and 2.3), and highlight the role of coping and adaptive
capacities (Section 2.4). The following section (2.5) describes the different
dimensions of vulnerability and exposure as well as trends therein.
Given that exposure and vulnerability are highly context-specific, this
section is by definition limited to a general overview (a more quantitative
perspective on trends is provided in Chapter 4). A methodological
discussion (Section 2.6) of approaches to identify and assess risk provides
indications of how the dimensions of exposure and vulnerability can be
explored in specific contexts, such as adaptation planning, and the
central role of risk perception and risk communication. The chapter
concludes with a cross-cutting discussion of risk accumulation and the
nature of disasters (Section 2.7).

"An early view of vulnerability in the context of disaster risk management
was related to the physical resistance of engineering structures (UNDHA,
1992), but more recent views relate vulnerability to characteristics of
social and environmental processes. It is directly related, in the context
of climate change, to the susceptibility, sensitivity, and lack of resilience
or capacities of the exposed system to cope with and adapt to extremes

hazards of different intensities or magnitudes through social processes
that increase the exposure and vulnerability of population groups, their
livelihoods, production, support infrastructure, and services (Chambers,

communication, especially the lack of appropriate information that can
lead to false risk perceptions (Birkmann and Fernando, 2008), which
have an important influence on the motivation and perceived ability to
act or to adapt to climate change and environmental stressors

"Vulnerability can be seen as situation-specific, interacting with a hazard
event to generate risk (Lavell, 2003; Cannon, 2006; Cutter et al., 2008).
Vulnerability to financial crisis, for example, does not infer vulnerability
to climate change or natural hazards. Similarly, a population might be
vulnerable to hurricanes, but not to landslides or floods. From a climate
change perspective, basic environmental conditions change progressively
and then induce new risk conditions for societies. For example, more
frequent and intense events may introduce factors of risk into new
areas, revealing underlying vulnerability. In fact, future vulnerability is
embedded in the present conditions of the communities that may be
exposed in the future (Patt et al., 2005, 2009); that is, new hazards in
areas not previously subject to them will reveal, not necessarily create,
underlying vulnerability factors (Alwang et al., 2001; Cardona et al.,

"O'Brien et al., 2004b). Vulnerability describes a set of conditions of
people that derive from the historical and prevailing cultural, social,
environmental, political, and economic contexts. In this sense, vulnerable
groups are not only at risk because they are exposed to a hazard but as
a result of marginality, of everyday patterns of social interaction and
organization, and access to resources (Watts and Bohle, 1993; Morrow,
1999; Bankoff, 2004). Thus, the effects of a disaster on any particular
household result from a complex set of drivers and interacting conditions.
It is important to keep in mind that people and communities are not
only or mainly victims, but also active managers of vulnerability (Ribot,
1996; Pelling, 1997, 2003). Therefore, integrated and multidimensional
approaches are highly important to understanding causes of vulnerability.

"The lack of a comprehensive conceptual framework that facilitates a
common multidisciplinary risk evaluation impedes the effectiveness of
disaster risk management and adaptation to climate change (Cardona,
2004). The option for anticipatory disaster risk reduction and adaptation
exists precisely because risk is a latent condition, which announces
potential future adverse effects (Lavell, 1996, 1999a). Understanding
disaster risk management as a social process allows for a shift in focus
from responding to the disaster event toward an understanding of
disaster risk (Cardona and Barbat, 2000; Cardona et al., 2003a). This
requires knowledge about how human interactions with the natural
environment lead to the creation of new hazards, and how persons,
property, infrastructure, goods, and the environment are exposed to

"Some global processes are significant drivers of risk and are particularly
related to vulnerability creation. There is high confidence that these
include population growth, rapid and inappropriate urban development,
international financial pressures, increases in socioeconomic inequalities,
trends and failures in governance (e.g., corruption, mismanagement),
and environmental degradation (Maskrey, 1993a,b, 1994, 1998; Mansilla,
1996; Cannon, 2006). Vulnerability profiles can be constructed that take
into consideration sources of environmental, social, and economic
marginality (Wisner, 2003). This also includes the consideration of the
links between communities and specific environmental services, and the
vulnerability of ecosystem components (Renaud, 2006; Williams et al.,
2008; Décamps, 2010; Dawson et al., 2011). In climate change-related
impact assessments, integration of underlying ‘causes of vulnerability’
and adaptive capacity is needed rather than focusing on technical
aspects only (Ribot, 1995; O’Brien et al., 2004b).

"Due to different conceptual frameworks and definitions, as well as
disciplinary views, approaches to address the causes of vulnerability
also differ (Burton et al., 1983; Blaikie et al., 1994; Harding et al., 2001;
Twigg, 2001; Adger and Brooks, 2003, 2006; Turner et al., 2003a,b;

identify key areas of difference and convergence. The two communities
tend to perceive the nature and timescale of the threat differently:
impacts due to climate change and return periods for extreme events
frequently use the language of uncertainty; but considerable knowledge
and certainty has been expressed regarding event characteristics and
exposures related to extreme historical environmental conditions.

in the political economy of resources and political power.

2) The social ecology perspective emphasizes the need to focus on
coupled human-environmental systems (Hewitt and Burton, 1971;
Turner et al, 2003a,b). This perspective stresses the ability of
societies to transform nature and also the implications of changes
in the environment for social and economic systems. It argues that
the exposure and susceptibility of a system can only be adequately
understood if these coupling processes and interactions are
addressed.

3) Holistic perspectives on vulnerability aim to go beyond technical
modeling to embrace a wider and comprehensive explanation of
vulnerability. These approaches differentiate exposure, susceptibility
and societal response capacities as causes or factors of vulnerability
(see Cardona, 1999a, 2001, 2011; Cardona and Barbat, 2000;
Cardona and Hurtado, 2000a,b; IDEA, 2005; Birkmann, 2006b;
Carrefio, 2006; Carrefio et al.,2007a,b, 2009; Birkmann and Fernando,
2008). A core element of these approaches is the feedback loop
which underlines that vulnerability is dynamic and is the main
driver and determinant of current or future risk.

4) In the context of climate change adaptation, different vulnerability
definitions and concepts have been developed and discussed. One
of the most prominent definitions is the one reflected in the IPCC
Fourth Assessment Report, which describes vulnerability as a
function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity, as also
reflected by, for instance, McCarthy et al. (2001), Brooks (2003),
K. O'Brien et al. (2004a), Fiissel and Klein (2006), Fiissel (2007),
and G. O’Brien et al. (2008). This approach differs from the
understanding of vulnerability in the disaster risk management
perspective, as the rate and magnitude of climate change is
considered. The concept of vulnerability here includes external
environmental factors of shock or stress. Therefore, in this view, the
magnitude and frequency of potential hazard events is to be
considered in the vulnerability to climate change. This view also
differs in its focus upon long-term trends and stresses rather than
on current shock forecasting, something not explicitly excluded but
rather rarely considered within the disaster risk management
approaches.

Most risk studies prior to the 1990s focused mainly on hazards,
whereas the more recent reversal of this paradigm has placed equal
focus on the vulnerability side of the equation. Emphasizing that risk
can be reduced through vulnerability is an acknowledgement of the
power of social, political, environmental, and economic factors in driving
risk. While these factors drive risk on one hand, they can on the other
hand be the source of capacity to reduce it (Carrefio et al., 2007a;

and exposure are its key determining factors. Furthermore, contrary to
the hazard, vulnerability and exposure can often be influenced by policy
and practice, including in the short to medium term. Therefore disaster
risk management and adaptation strategies have to address mainly
these same risk factors (Cardona 1999a, 2011; Vogel and O’Brien, 2004;

intensity of extreme climate and weather events — low-probability,
high-intensity — and exposure to them tend to be more pervasive in
explaining disaster loss than vulnerability itself. But as the events get
less extreme — higher-probability, lower-intensity — the vulnerability of
exposed elements plays an increasingly important role in explaining the
level of impact. Vulnerability is a major cause of the increasing adverse
effects of non-extreme events, that is, small recurrent disasters that
many times are not visible at the national or sub-national level

functioning, or organization to better survive hazards (Saldafia-Zorrilla,

and/or the recovery time will be shorter, but high capacity to recover
does not guarantee equal levels of capacity to anticipate. In other
words, the capacity to cope does not infer the capacity to adapt

Some have noted that the emphasis on vulnerability tended to ignore
capacity, focusing too much on the negative aspects of vulnerability

"In the climate change community of practice, adaptive capacity has been at the forefront of thinking regarding how to respond to the

ultimate objective that action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions be guided by the time needed for ecosystems to adapt naturally to

"The capacity described by the disasters community in the past decades does not frequently distinguish between ‘coping’ or ‘adaptive’
capacities, and instead the term is used to indicate positive characteristics or circumstances that could be seen to offset vulnerability
(Anderson and Woodrow, 1989). Because the approach is focused on disasters, it has been associated with the immediate-term coping
needs, and contrasts from the long-term perspective generally discussed in the context of climate change, where the aim is to adapt to
changes rather than to just overcome them. There has been considerable discussion throughout the vulnerability and poverty and climate
change scholarly communities about whether coping strategies are a stepping stone toward adaptation, or may lead to maladaptation
(Yohe and Tol, 2002; Eriksen et al., 2005) (see Chapter 1). Useful alternative terminology is to talk about ‘capacity to change and adjust’
(Nelson and Finan, 2009) for adaptive capacity, and ‘capacity to absorb’ instead of coping capacity (Cutter et al., 2008).

"In simple terms, coping capacity refers to the “ability of people, organizations, and systems, using available skills and resources, to face
and manage adverse conditions, emergencies, or disasters” (UNISDR, 2009b). Coping capacity is typically used in humanitarian discourse
to indicate the extent to which a system can survive the impacts of an extreme event. It suggests that people can deal with some
degree of destabilization, and acknowledges that at a certain point this capacity may be exceeded. Eriksen et al. (2005) link coping
capacity to entitlements — the set of commodity bundles that can be commanded — during an adverse event. The ability to mobilize this
capacity in an emergency is the manifestation of coping strategies (Gaillard, 2010). Furthermore, Birkmann (2011b) underscores that
differences between coping and adaptation are also linked to the quality of the response process. While coping aims to maintain the
system and its functions in the face of adverse conditions, adaptation involves changes and requires reorganization processes.
"	Text
"Adaptive capacity refers to the ability of a system or individual to adapt to climate change, but it can also be used in the context of
disaster risk. Because adaptive capacity is considered to determine “the ability of an individual, family, community, or other social group
to adjust to changes in the environment guaranteeing survival and sustainability” (Lavell, 1999b), many believe that in the context of
uncertain environmental changes, adaptive capacity will be of key significance. Dayton-Johnson (2004) defines adaptive capacity as the
“vulnerability of a society before disaster strikes and its resilience after the fact.” Some ways of classifying adaptive capacity include
‘baseline adaptive capacity’ (Dore and Etkin, 2003), which refers to the capacity that allows countries to adapt to existing climate
variability, and ‘socially optimal adaptive capacity,’ which is determined by the norms and rules in individual locations. Another definition
of adaptive capacity is the “property of a system to adjust its characteristics or behavior, in order to expand its coping range under
existing climate variability, or future climate conditions” (Brooks and Adger, 2004). This links adaptive capacity to coping capacity,
because coping range is synonymous with coping capacity, referring to the boundaries of systems’ ability to cope (Yohe and Tol, 2002).

"Development planning, including land use and urban planning, river basin
and land management, hazard-resistant building codes, and landscape
design are all activities that can reduce exposure and vulnerability to
hazards and change (Cardona, 2001, 2010). The ability to carry these out
in an effective way is part of the capacity to reduce risk. Other activities
include diversifying income sources, maintaining social networks, and
collective action to avoid development that puts people at higher risk

"Having the capacity to reduce the risk posed by hazards and changes
implies that people’s ability to manage is not engulfed, so they are not
left significantly worse off. Reducing risk means that people do not have
to devote substantial resources to dealing with a hazard as it occurs, but
instead have the capacity to anticipate this sort of event. This is the type
of capacity that is necessary in order to adapt to climate change, and
involves conscious, planned efforts to reduce risk. The capacity to reduce
risk also depends on ex post actions, which involve making choices after
one event that reduce the impact of future events.

Capacity to change relies on yet another set of factors. Importantly,
however, these dimensions of capacity are not unrelated to each other:
the ability to change is also necessary for risk reduction and response
capacities.

"Just like vulnerability, capacity is dynamic and will change depending
on circumstances. The discussion in Box 2-1 indicates that there are
differing perspectives on how coping and adaptive capacity relate.
When coping and adapting are viewed as different, it follows that the
capacity needs for each are also different (Cooper et al., 2008). This
suggests that work done to understand the drivers of adaptive ex ante
capacity (Leichenko and O'Brien, 2002; Yohe and Tol, 2002; Brenkert and
Malone, 2005; Brooks et al., 2005; Haddad, 2005; Vincent, 2007; Sharma

"Capacity to respond is relevant both ex post and ex ante, since it
encompasses everything necessary to be able to react once an extreme
event takes place. Response capacity is mostly used to refer to the
ability of institutions to react following a natural hazard, in particular
ex post during emergency response. However, effective response
requires substantial ex ante planning and investments in disaster
preparedness and early warning (not only in terms of financial cost but
particularly in terms of awareness raising and capacity building; IFRC,
2009). Furthermore, there are also response phases for gradual changes
in ecosystems or temperature regimes caused by climate change.
Responding spans everything from people’s own initial reactions to a
hazard upon its impact to actions to try to reduce secondary damage. It
is worth noting that in climate change literature, anticipatory actions
are often referred to as responses, which differs from the way this term
is used in the context of disaster risk, where it only implies the actions
taken once there has been an impact.

dominated disaster practice, and focus on capacity was limited to
understanding inherent response capacity. Thus, emphasizing capacity to
reduce risk was not a priority. However, in the face of growing evidence
as to significant increases in disaster losses and the inevitable increase
in financial and human resources dedicated to disaster response and
recovery, there is an increasing recognition of the need to promote the
capacity for prevention and risk reduction over time (Lavell, 1994, 1999b,
2003). Notwithstanding, different actors, stakeholders, and interests
influence the capacity to anticipate a disaster. Actions to reduce exposure
and vulnerability of one group of people may come at the cost of
increasing it for another, for example when flood risks are shifted from
upstream communities to downstream communities through large-
scale upstream dike construction (Birkmann, 2011a). Consequently, it
is not sufficient to evaluate the success of adaptation or capacities
to reduce risk by focusing on the objectives of one group only. The
evaluation of success of adaptation strategies depends on the spatial
and temporal scale used (Adger et al., 2005).

Pushing the recovery toward transformation and change requires taking
a new approach rather than returning to ‘normalcy.’ Several examples
have shown that capacity to recover is severely limited by poverty

"Having the capacity to change is a requirement in order to adapt to
climate change. Viewing adaptation as requiring transformation implies
that it cannot be understood as only a set of actions that physically
protect people from natural hazards (Pelling, 2010). In the context of
natural hazards, the opportunity for changing is often greatest during the
recovery phase, when physical infrastructure has to be rebuilt and can be
improved, and behavioral patterns and habits can be contemplated
(Susman et al., 1983; Renn, 1992; Comfort et al, 1999; Vogel and O’Brien,
2004; Birkmann et al., 2010a). This is an opportunity to rethink whether

"aspects of capacity. Wisner (2001a) shows how poorly constructed
shelters, where people were placed temporarily in El Salvador following
Hurricane Mitch in 1998, turned into ‘permanent’ housing when
nongovernmental organization (NGO) support ran out. When two
strong earthquakes hit in January and February 2001, the shelters
collapsed, leaving the people homeless again. This example illustrates
the perils associated with emergency measures that focus only on
responding, rather than on the capacity to reduce risk and change.
Response capacity is also differential (Chatterjee, 2010). The most
effective ex ante risk management strategies will often include a
combination of risk reduction and enhanced capacity to respond to
impacts (including smarter response by better preparedness and early
warning, as well risk transfer such as insurance).

"Capacity to recover is not only dependent on the extent of a physical
impact, but also on the extent to which society has been affected,
including the ability to resume livelihood activities (Hutton and Haque,
2003). This capacity is driven by numerous factors, including mental and
physical ability to recover, financial and environmental viability, and
political will. Because reconstruction processes often do not take
people's livelihoods into account, instead focusing on their safety, new
settlements are often located where people do not want to be, which
brings change — but not necessarily change that leads to sustainable
development. Innumerable examples indicate how people who have been
resettled return back to their original location, moving into dilapidated
houses or setting up new housing, even if more solid housing is
available elsewhere (e.g., El Salvador after Hurricane Mitch), simply
because the new location does not allow them easy access to their
fields, to markets or roads, or to the sea (e.g., South and Southeast Asia
after the 2004 tsunami).

"The various capacities to respond and to survive hazard events and
changes have also been discussed within the context of the concept of
resilience. While originally, the concept of resilience was strongly linked
to an environmental perspective on ecosystems and their ability to
maintain major functions even in times of adverse conditions and crises
(Holling, 1973), the concept has undergone major shifts and has been
enhanced and applied also in the field of social-ecological systems and
disaster risk (Gunderson, 2000; Walker et al., 2004; UN, 2005; Abel et al.,
2006). Folke (2006) differentiates three different resilience concepts
that encompass an engineering resilience perspective that focuses on
recovery and constancy issues, while the ecological and social resilience
focus on persistence and robustness and, finally, the integrated social-
ecological resilience perspective deals with adaptive capacity, trans-
formability, learning, and innovation (Folke, 2006). In disaster risk
reduction the terms resilience building and the lack of resilience have
achieved a high recognition. These terms are linked to capacities of
communities or societies to deal with the impact of a hazard event
or crises and the ability to learn and create resilience through these
experiences. Recent papers, however, also criticize the unconsidered use
or the simply transfer of the concept of resilience into the wider context
of adaptation (see, e.g., Cannon and Miller-Mahn, 2010). Additionally,
the lack of resilience has also been used as an umbrella to examine
deficiencies in capacities that communities encompass in order to deal
with hazard events. Describing the lack of resilience, Cardona and
Barbat (2000) identify various capacities that are often insufficient in
societies that suffer heavily during disasters, such as the deficiencies
regarding the capacity to anticipate, to cope with, and to adapt to
changing environmental conditions and natural hazards.

"The physical exposure of human beings to hazards has been partly
shaped by patterns of settlement of hazard-prone landscapes for the
countervailing benefits they offer (UNISDR, 2004). Furthermore, in the
context of climate change, physical exposure is in many regions also
increasing due to spatial extension of natural hazards, such as floods,
areas affected by droughts, or delta regions affected by salinization.
This does not make the inhabitants of such locations vulnerable per se
because they may have capacities to resist the impacts of extreme events;
this is the essential difference between exposure and vulnerability. The
physical dimension of vulnerability begins with the recognition of a link
between an extreme physical or natural phenomenon and a vulnerable
human group (Westgate and O'Keefe, 1976). Physical vulnerability
comprises aspects of geography, location, and place (Wilbanks, 2003);
settlement patterns; and physical structures (Shah, 1995; UNISDR,
2004) including infrastructure located in hazard-prone areas or with
deficiencies in resistance or susceptibility to damage (Wilches-Chaux,
1989). Further, Cutter’s (1996) ‘hazards of place’ model of vulnerability
expressly refers to the temporal dimension (see Section 2.5.4.2), which,
in recognizing the dynamic nature of place vulnerability, argues for a
more nuanced approach.

"The environmental dimension of vulnerability also deals with the role of
regulating ecosystem services and ecosystem functions, which directly
impact human well-being, particularly for those social groups that
heavily depend on these services and functions due to their livelihood
profiles. Especially in developing countries and countries in transition,
poorer rural communities often entirely depend on ecosystem services
and functions to meet their livelihood needs. The importance of these
ecosystem services and ecosystem functions for communities in the
context of environmental vulnerability and disaster risk has been
recognized by the 2009 and 2011 Global Assessment Reports on
Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR, 2009a, 2011) as well as by the
Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA, 2005). The degradation of
ecosystem services and functions can contribute to an exacerbation of
both the natural hazard context and the vulnerability of people. The
erosion of ecosystem services and functions can contribute to the decrease
of coping and adaptive capacities in terms of reduced alternatives for
livelihoods and income-generating activities due to the degradation of
natural resources. Additionally, a worsening of environmental services

et al., 2006). As an example, vulnerabilities arising from floodplain
encroachment and increased hazard exposure are typical of the intricate
and finely balanced relationships within human-environment systems
(Kates, 1971; White, 1974) of which we have been aware for several
decades. Increasing human occupancy of floodplains increases exposure
to flood hazards. It can put not only the lives and property of human
beings at risk but can damage floodplain ecology and associated
ecosystem services. Increased exposure of human beings comes about
even in the face of actions designed to reduce the hazard. Structural
responses and alleviation measures (e.g., provision of embankments,
channel modification, and other physical alterations of the floodplain
environment), designed ostensibly to reduce flood risk, can have the
reverse result. This is variously known as the levee effect (Kates, 1971;
White, 1974), the escalator effect (Parker, 1995), or the ‘safe development
paradox’ (Burby, 2006) in which floodplain encroachment leads to
increased flood risk and, ultimately, flood damages. A maladaptive
policy response to such exposure provides structural flood defenses,
which encourage the belief that the flood risk has been removed. This
in turn encourages more floodplain encroachment and a reiteration of
the cycle as the flood defenses (built to a lower design specification) are
exceeded. This is typical of many maladaptive policy responses, which
focus on the symptoms rather than the causes of poor environmental
management.

flood-prone areas appear to have played a major role in increasing
flood risk in Africa over the last few decades (Di Baldassarre et al.,

of the interactions (e.g., between neoliberalism and the opening up of

uncertainty over environmental risk, which most influences agricultural
households’ decisionmaking. However, there is not a direct and inevitable
link between disaster impact and increased impoverishment of a rural
population. In Nicaragua, Jakobsen (2009) found that a household's
probability of being poor in the years following Hurricane Mitch was not
affected by whether it was living in an area struck but by factors such as
off-farm income, household size, and access to credit. Successful coping
post-Hurricane Mitch resulted in poor households regaining most of
their assets and resisting a decline into a state of extreme poverty.
However, longer-term adaptation strategies, which might have lifted them
out of the poverty category, eluded the majority and were independent
of having experienced Hurricane Mitch. Thus, while poor (rural) households
may cope with the impacts of a disaster in the relatively short term,
their level of vulnerability, arising from a complex of environmental,
social, economic, and political factors, is such that they cannot escape
the poverty trap or fully reinstate development gains.

"The increase in the number and extent of informal settlements or slums
(UN-HABITAT, 2003; Utzinger and Keiser, 2006) is important because they
are often located on marginal land within cities or on the periphery
because of the lack of alternative locations or the fact that areas close
to river systems or areas at the coast are sometimes state land that can
be more easily accessed than private land. Because of their location,
slums are often exposed to hydrometeorological-related hazards such
as landslides (Nathan, 2008) and floods (Bertoni, 2006; Colten, 2006;
Aragon-Durand, 2007; Douglas et al, 2008; Zahran et al., 2008).
Vulnerability in informal settlements can also be elevated because of
poor health (Sclar et al., 2005), livelihood insecurity (Kantor and Nair,
2005), lack of access to service provision and basic needs (such as
clean water and good governance), and a reduction in the capacity of
formal players to steer developments and adaptation initiatives in a
comprehensive, preventive, and inclusive way (Birkmann et al., 2010b).
Lagos, Nigeria (Adelekan, 2010), and Chittagong, Bangladesh (Rahman
et al., 2010), serve as clear examples of where an upward trend in the
area of slums has resulted in an increase in the exposure of slum
dwellers to flooding. Despite the fact that rapidly growing informal
and poor urban areas are often hotspots of hazard exposure, for a
number of locations the urban poor have developed more or less
successful coping and adaptation strategies to reduce their vulnerability
in dealing with changing environmental conditions (e.g., Birkmann et al.,

especially political vulnerability created through conflict, which can drive
people from their homelands. Increasingly it relates to economically and
environmentally displaced persons but can also refer to those who do

"Certain population groups may be more vulnerable than others to climate
variability and extremes. For example, the very young and old are more
vulnerable to heat extremes than other population groups (Staffogia et
al., 2006; Gosling et al., 2009). A rapidly aging population at the
community to country scale bears implications for health, social isolation,
economic growth, family composition, and mobility, all of which are
social determinants of vulnerability. However, as discussed further

not reflect the diversity or dynamics of people's changing conditions.

primarily on aspects of societal organization and collective aspects

‘individual’ descriptor to clarify issues of scale and units of analysis

are also useful when considering psychological trauma in and after
disasters (e.g., Few, 2007), including that related to family breakdown

displacement, social groups, education, health and well-being, culture,

"Although there is also a lack of clear evidence for a systematic trend in
extreme climate events and migration, there are clear instances of the
impact of extreme hydrometeorological events on displacement. For
example, floods in Mozambique displaced 200,000 people in 2001,
163,000 people in 2007, and 102,000 more in 2008 (INGC, 2009; IOM,
2009); in Niger, large internal movements of people are due to
pervasive changes related to drought and desertification trends (Afifi,
2011); in the Mekong River Delta region, changing flood patterns appear
to be associated with migratory movements (White, 2002; |OM, 2009);
and Hurricane Katrina, for which social vulnerability, race, and class
played an important role in outward and returning migration (Elliott
and Pais, 2006; Landry et al., 2007; Myers et al., 2008), resulted in the
displacement of over one million people. As well as the displacement
effect, there is evidence for increased vulnerability to extreme events
among migrant groups because of an inability to understand extreme
event-related information due to language problems, prioritization of
finding employment and housing, and distrust of authorities (Enarson
and Morrow, 2000; Donner and Rodriguez, 2008).

"Trends in migration, as a component of changing population dynamics,
have the potential to rise because of alterations in extreme climate
event frequency. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs and the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre
have estimated that around 20 million people were displaced or
evacuated in 2008 because of rapid onset climate-related disasters
(OCHA/IDMC, 2009). Further, over the last 30 years, twice as many
people have been affected by droughts (slow onset events not included
in the previous point) as by storms (1.6 billion compared with
approximately 718 million) (IOM, 2009). However, because of the multi-
causal nature of migration, the relationship between climatic variability
and change in migration is contested (Black, 2001) as are the terms
environmental and climate refugees (Myers, 1993; Castles 2002; |OM,
2009). Despite an increase in the number of hydrometeorological
disasters between 1990 and 2009, the International Organization on
Migration reports no major impact on international migratory flows
because displacement is temporary and often confined within a region,
and displaced individuals do not possess the financial resources to
migrate (IOM, 2009).

"Although data on climate change-forced displacement is incomplete, it
is clear that the many outcomes of climate change processes will be
seen and felt as disasters by the affected populations (Oliver-Smith,
2009). For people affected by disasters, subsequent displacement and
resettlement often constitute a second disaster in their lives. As part
of the Impoverishment Risks and Reconstruction approach, Cernea
(1996) outlines the eight basic risks to which people are subjected by
displacement: landlessness, joblessness, homelessness, marginalization,
food insecurity, increased morbidity, loss of access to common property
resources, and social disarticulation. When people are forced from their
known environments, they become separated from the material and
cultural resource base upon which they have depended for life as
individuals and as communities (Altman and Low, 1992). The material
losses most often associated with displacement and resettlement are
losses of access to customary housing and resources. Displaced people
are often distanced from their sources of livelihood, whether land,
common property (water, forests, etc.), or urban markets and clientele
(Koenig, 2009). Disasters and displacement may sever the identification
with an environment that may once have been one of the principle
features of cultural identity (Oliver-Smith, 2006). Displacement for any
group can be distressing, but for indigenous peoples it can result in
particularly severe impacts. The environment and ties to land are
considered to be essential elements in the survival of indigenous societies
and distinctive cultural identities (Colchester, 2000). The displacement
and resettlement process has been consistently shown to disrupt and
destroy those networks of social relationships on which the poor

Ocean tsunami of 2004, many males were out to sea in boats, fulfilling
their roles as fishermen, and were thus less exposed than were many
women who were on the seashore, fulfilling their roles as preparers and
marketers of the fish catch. However, the women were made vulnerable
not simply by their location and role but by societal norms which did not
encourage survival training for girls (e.g., to swim or climb trees) and
which placed the majority of the burden of child and elder care with
women. Thus, escape was made more difficult for women carrying

"One of the largest bodies of research evidence, and one which can be an
exemplar for the way many other marginalized groups are differentially
impacted or affected by extreme events, has been on gender and disaster,
and on women in particular (e.g., Neal and Phillips, 1990; Enarson and
Morrow, 1998; Neumayer and Pliimper, 2007). This body of literature is
relatively recent, particularly in a developed world context, given the
longer recognition of gender concerns in the development field
(Fordham, 1998). The specific gender and climate change link including
self-defined gender groups has been even more recent (e.g., Masika,
2002; Pincha and Krishna, 2009). The research evidence emphasizes the
social construction of gendered vulnerability in which women and girls
are often (although not always) at greater risk of dying in disasters,
typically marginalized from decisionmaking fora, and discriminated and
acted against in post-disaster recovery and reconstruction efforts
(Houghton, 2009; Sultana, 2010).

"Research evidence of the differential vulnerability of social groups is
extensive and raises concerns about the disproportionate effects of
climate change on identifiable, marginalized populations (Bohle et al.,
1994; Kasperson and Kasperson, 2001; Thomalla et al., 2006). Particular
groups and conditions have been identified as having differential
exposure or vulnerability to extreme events, for example race/ethnicity
(Fothergill et al, 1999; Elliott and Pais, 2006; Cutter and Finch, 2008),
socioeconomic class and caste (O'Keefe et al., 1976; Peacock et al.,
1997; Ray-Bennett, 2009), gender (Sen, 1981), age (both the elderly and
children; Jabry, 2003; Wisner, 2006b; Bartlett, 2008), migration, and
housing tenure (whether renter or owner), as among the most common
social vulnerability characteristics (Cutter and Finch, 2008). Morrow
(1999) extends and refines this list to include residents of group living
facilities; ethnic minorities (by language); recent migrants (including
immigrants); tourists and transients; physically or mentally disabled (see
also McGuire et al., 2007; Peek and Stough, 2010); large households;
renters; large concentrations of children and youth; poor households;
the homeless (see also Wisner, 1998); and women-headed households.
Generally, the state of vulnerability is defined by a specific population
at a particular scale; aggregations (and generalizations) are often less
meaningful and require careful interpretation (Adger and Kelly, 1999).

"The education dimension ranges across the vulnerability of educational
building structures; issues related to access to education; and also
sharing and access to disaster risk reduction and climate adaptation
information and knowledge (Wisner, 2006b). Priority 3 of the Hyogo
Framework for Action 2005-2015 recommends the use of knowledge,
innovation, and education to build a ‘culture of safety and resilience’ at
all levels (UNISDR, 2007a). A well-informed and motivated population
can lead to disaster risk reduction but it requires the collection and
dissemination of knowledge and information on hazards, vulnerabilities,
and capacities. However, “It is not information per se that determines
action, but how people interpret it in the context of their experience,
beliefs and expectations. Perceptions of risks and hazards are culturally
and socially constructed, and social groups construct different meanings
for potentially hazardous situations” (Mclvor and Paton, 2007). In addition
to knowledge and information, explicit environmental education programs
among children and adults may have benefits for public understanding
of risk, vulnerability, and exposure to extreme events (UNISDR, 2004;
Kobori, 2009; Nomura, 2009; Patterson et al., 2009; Kuhar et al., 2010),
because they promote resilience building in socio-ecological systems
through their role in stewardship of biological diversity and ecosystem

depend largely upon a subsistence economy, with a lack of education, health, and other resources. However, despite these markers of

"exchange must be considered because there is emerging evidence of a

experienced natural hazards (and thus may have information and
knowledge gained directly through that experience) are, in general,
better prepared than those who have not (Kates, 1971). However, this

has been called the ‘prison of experience’ (Kates, 1962), in which people's

"Unfortunately, the health dimensions of disasters are difficult to measure
because of difficulties in attributing the health condition (including

addition, some of the effects are delayed in time, which again makes
attribution difficult (Bennet, 1970; Hales et al., 2003). The difficulty of
collection of epidemiological data in crisis situations is also a factor,

"Health vulnerability is the sum of all the risk and protective factors
that determine the degree to which individuals or communities could
experience adverse impacts from extreme weather events (Balbus and
Malina, 2009). Vulnerabilities can arise from a wide range of institutional,
geographic, environmental, socioeconomic, biological sensitivity, and other
factors, which can vary spatially and temporally. Biological sensitivity
can be associated with developmental stage (eg., children are at
increased mortality risk from diarrheal diseases); pre-existing medical
conditions (e.g., diabetics are at increased risk during heat waves);
acquired conditions (e.g., malaria immunity); and genetic factors
(Balbus and Malina, 2009). Vulnerability can be viewed both from the
perspective of the population groups more likely to experience adverse
health outcomes and from the perspective of the public health and
health care interventions required to prevent adverse health impacts
during and following an extreme event.
"	Text
"A number of public health impacts are expected to worsen in climate-
related disasters such as storms, floods, landslides, heat, drought, and
wildfire. These are highly context-specific but range from worsening of
existing chronic illnesses (which could be widespread), through possible
toxic exposures (in air, water or food), to deaths (expected to be few to
moderate but may be many in low-income countries) (Keim, 2008).
Public health and health care services required for preventing adverse
health impacts from an extreme weather event include surveillance and
control activities for infectious diseases, access to safe water and improved
sanitation, food security, maintenance of solid waste management and
other critical infrastructure, maintenance of hospitals and other health
care infrastructure, provision of mental health services, sufficient and
safe shelter to prevent or mitigate displacement, and effective warning
and informing systems (Keim, 2008). Further, it is important to consider
the synergistic effects of NaTech disasters (Natural Hazard Triggering a
Technological Disaster) where impacts can be considerable if only single,
simple hazard events are planned for. In an increasingly urbanized world,
interactions between natural disasters and simultaneous technological
accidents must be given attention (Cruz et al., 2004); the combination
of an earthquake, tsunami, and radiation release at the Japanese
Fukushima Nuclear Power plant in March 2011 is the most recent
example. Lack of provision of these services increases population
vulnerability, particularly in individuals with greater biological sensitivity
to an adverse health outcome. Although there is little evidence for
trends in the exposure or vulnerability of public health infrastructure,
the imperative for a resilient health infrastructure is widely recognized
in the context of extreme climate events (Burkle and Greenough, 2008;

evidence from past climate/weather-related disaster events (across a

evidence (Haines et al., 2006; Confalonieri et al., 2007) that current and

"However, trends in well-being and health are difficult to assess.
Indicators that characterize a lack of well-being and a high degree of
susceptibility are, for example, indicators of undernourishment and
malnutrition. The database for the Millennium Development Goals and
respective statistics of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
underscore that trends in undernourishment are spatially and temporally
differentiated. While, as but one example, the trend in undernourished
people in Burundi shows a significant increase from 1991 to 2005, an
opposite trend of a reduction in the percentage of undernourished
people can be observed in Angola (see UN Statistics Division, 2011;

Stamatakis et al., 2010). Observed trends in major public health threats
such as the infectious or communicable diseases HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis,
and malaria, although not directly linked to the diminution of long-term
resilience of some populations, have been identified as having the
potential to do so (IFRC, 2008). In addition to the diseases themselves,
persistent and increasing obstacles to expanding or strengthening
health systems such as inadequate human resources and poor hospital
and laboratory infrastructure as observed in some countries (Vitoria et

exposure where, for example, malaria and HIV/Aids occasionally reach

knowledge can reduce vulnerabilities too (Gaillard et al, 2007, 2010).
Furthermore, cultural practices are often subtle and may be opaque to
outsiders. The early hazards paradigm literature (White, 1974; Burton et

¢ Ethnicity and Culture. Deeply rooted cultural values are a dominant
factor in whether or not communities adapt to climate change. For
example, recent research in Northern Burkina Faso indicates that
two ethnic groups have adopted very different strategies due to
cultural values and historical relations, despite their presence in
the same physical environment and their shared experience of
climate change (Nielsen and Reenberg, 2010).

¢ Locally Based Risk Management Culture. Wisner (2003) has argued
that the point in developing a ‘culture of prevention’ is to build
networks at the neighborhood level capable of ongoing hazard
assessment and mitigation at the micro level. He has noted that while
community based NGOs emerged to support recovery after the
Mexico City and Northridge earthquakes, these were not sustained
over time to promote risk reduction activities. This evidence
confirms other widespread experience indicating that ways still
need to be found to extend the agenda of Community-Based
Organizations into effective action to reduce climate risks and
promote adaptation to climate change.

Conflicting Cultures: Who Benefits, and Who Loses when Risks are
Reduced? A critical cultural conflict can arise when private actions
to reduce disaster risks and adapting to climate change by one
party have negative consequences on another. This regularly applies
in river flood hazard management where upstream measures to
reduce risks can significantly increase downstream threats to
persons and property. Adger has argued that if appropriate risk
reduction actions are to occur, the key players must bear all the
costs and receive all the benefits from their actions (Adger, 2009).
However, this can be problematic if adaptation is limited to specific
local interests only.

"Given the degree of cultural diversity identified, the importance of
understanding differential risk perceptions in a cultural context is
reinforced (Marris et al., 1998). Cultural Theory has contributed to an
understanding of how people interpret their world and define risk
according to their worldviews: hierarchical, fatalistic, individualistic,
and egalitarian (Douglas and Wildavsky, 1982). Too often policies and
studies focus on ‘the public’ in the aggregate and too little on the needs,
interests, and attitudes of different social and cultural groups (see also

operational in a given place and time (more or less participatory,
deliberative, and democratic; integrated; or disjointed) could be an
important factor in either vulnerability creation or reduction (Comfort et
al, 1999). Furthermore, risk-specific policies must also be integrated

formal institutions. This view allows for a discussion of institutional
structures such as property rights and land tenure issues (Toni and

forms a bridge between the social and the environmental/ecological
dimensions and can induce sustainable or unsustainable exploitation

"The cultural dimension also includes the potential vulnerability of
aboriginal and native peoples in the context of climate extremes.
Globally, indigenous populations are frequently dependent on primary
production and the natural resource base while being subject to
(relatively) poor socioeconomic conditions (including poor health, high
unemployment, low levels of education, and greater poverty). This
applies to groups from Canada (Turner and Clifton, 2009), to Australia
(Campbell et al., 2008), to the Pacific (Mimura et al., 2007). Small island
states, often with distinct cultures, typically show high vulnerability and
low adaptive capacity to climate change (Nurse and Sem, 2001).
However, historically, indigenous groups have had to contend with many
hazards and, as a consequence, have developed capacities to cope
(Campbell, 2006) such as the use of traditional knowledge systems,
locally appropriate building construction with indigenous materials, and
a range of other customary practices (Campbell, 2006).

"This broader understanding of the institutional dimension also takes us
into a recognition of the role of social networks, community bonds and
organizing structures, and processes that can buffer the impacts of
extreme events (Nakagawa and Shaw, 2004) partly through increasing
social cohesion but also recognizing ambiguous or negative forms
(UNISDR, 2004). For example, social capital/assets (Portes, 1998;
Putnam, 2000) — “the norms and networks that enable people to act
collectively” (Woolcock and Narayan, 2000) — have a role in vulnerability
reduction (Pelling, 1998). Social capital (or its lack) is both a cause and
effect of vulnerability and thus can result in either positive benefit or
negative impact; to be a part of a social group and accrue social assets
is often to indicate others’ exclusion. It also includes attempts to
reframe climate debates by acknowledging the possibility of diverse
impacts on human security, which opens up human rights discourses
and rights-based approaches to disaster risk reduction (Kuwali, 2008;
Mearns and Norton, 2010).

"The institutional dimension includes the relationship between policy
setting and policy implementation in risk and disaster management. Top-
down approaches assume policies are directly translated into action on
the ground; bottom-up approaches recognize the importance of other
actors in shaping policy implementation (Urwin and Jordan, 2008). Twigg’s
categorization of the characteristics of the ideal disaster resilient
community (Twigg, 2007) adopts the latter approach. This guideline
document, which has been field tested by NGOs, identifies the important
relations between the community and the enabling environment of
governance at various scales in creating resilience, and by inference,
reducing vulnerability. This set of 167 characteristics (organized under five
thematic areas) also refers to institutional forms for (and processes of)
engagement with risk assessment, risk management, and hazard and
vulnerability mapping. These have been championed by institutions
working across scales to create the Hyogo Framework for Action (UNISDR,
2007a) and associated tools (Davis et al., 2004; UNISDR, 2007b) with
the goal to reduce disaster risk and vulnerability. However, linkages
across scales and the inclusion of local knowledge systems are still not

rule systems and habitualized behavior and norms that govern society

environmental governance practices toward more integrated approaches.
With the turn of the century, there has been recognition of the need to
move beyond technical solutions and to deal with the patterns and

the emergence of a more integrated approach to environmental
management, a focus on prevention (UNEP, 2007), the incorporation of
knowledge from the local to the global in environment policies
(Karlsson, 2007), and co-management and involvement of stakeholders
from all sectors in the management of natural resources (Plummer, 2006;

"The degree of economic vulnerability is exhibited post-event by the
magnitude and duration of the indirect follow-on effects. These effects
can comprise business interruption costs to firms unable to access
inputs from their suppliers or service their customers, income losses of
households unable to get to work, or the deterioration of the fiscal
stance post-disasters as less taxes are collected and significant public
relief and reconstruction expenditure is required. At a macroeconomic
level, adverse impacts include effects on gross domestic product (GDP),
consumption, and the fiscal position (Mechler et al., 2010). Key drivers
of economic vulnerability are low levels of income and GDP, constrained
tax revenue, low domestic savings, shallow financial markets, and high
indebtedness with little access to external finance (OAS, 1991; Benson

vulnerability and risk aversion in many exposed countries, as well as the
emergence of novel public-private partnership instruments for pricing

other donor organizations, to consider pre-disaster financial instruments
as an important component of disaster risk management (Linnerooth-

"Economic vulnerability to external shocks, including natural hazards,
has been inexactly defined in the literature and conceptualizations
often have overlapped with risk, resilience, or exposure. One line of
research focusing on financial vulnerability, as a subset of economic
vulnerability, framed the problem in terms of risk preference and
aversion, a conceptualization more common to economists. Risk
aversion, in this context, denotes the ability of economic agents to
absorb risk financially (Arrow and Lind, 1970). There are many ways to
absorb the financial burdens of disasters, with market-based insurance
being one, albeit prominent, option, although more particularly in a
developed country context. Households as economic agents often use
informal mechanisms relying on family and relatives abroad or outside
a disaster area; governments may simply rely on their tax base or
international assistance. Yet, in the face of large and covariate risks,
such ad hoc mechanisms often break down, particularly in developing
countries (see Linnerooth-Bayer and Mechler, 2007).

"Conflicts between formal and informal governance or governmental
and nongovernmental strategies and norms can generate additional
vulnerabilities for communities exposed to environmental change. An
example of these conflicts of formal and informal strategies is linked to
flood protection measures. While local people might expend resources
to deal with increasing flood events (e.g., adapting their livelihoods and
production patterns to changing flood regimes), formal adaptation
strategies, particularly in developing countries, prioritize structural
measures (e.g., dike systems or relocation strategies) that have severe
consequences for the vulnerability of communities dependent on local
ecosystem services, such as fishing and farming systems (see Birkmann,
2011a,b). These conflicts between formal and informal or governmental
and nongovernmental management systems and norms are an important
factor that increase vulnerability and reduce adaptive capacity of the
overall system (Birkmann et al., 2010b). Countries with institutional and
governance fragilities often lack the capacity to identify and reduce
risks and to deal with emergencies and disasters effectively. The recent
disaster and problems in coping and recovery in the aftermath of the
earthquake in Haiti or the problems in terms of managing recovery and
emergency management after the Pakistan floods are examples that
illustrate the importance of governance as a subject of resilience and

measures need to specifically target climate extremes-poverty linkages
as not all poverty reduction measures reduce vulnerability to climate
extremes and vice versa. Further, measures are required across scales

"Paavola’s (2008) analysis of livelihoods, vulnerability, and adaptation to
climate change in Morogoro, Tanzania, is indicative of the way extreme
events impact livelihoods in specific ways. Here, rural households are
found to be more vulnerable to climate variability and climate change
than are those in urban environments (see also Section 2.5.1.3). This is
because rural incomes and consumption levels are significantly lower,
there are greater levels of poverty, and more limited access to markets
and other services. More specifically, women are made more vulnerable
than men because they lack access to livelihoods other than climate-
sensitive agriculture. Local people have employed a range of strategies
(extensification, intensification, diversification, and migration) to
manage climate variability but these have sometimes had undesirable
environmental outcomes, which have increased their vulnerability. In
the absence of opportunities to fundamentally change their livelihood
options, we see here an example of short-term coping rather than long-
term climate adaptation (Paavola, 2008).

"Reviewing singular dimensions of vulnerability cannot provide an
appropriate level of synthesis. Considerable conceptual advances arose
from the early recognition that so-called natural disasters were not
‘natural’ at all (O'Keefe et al, 1976) but were the result of structural
inequalities rooted in political economy. This critique required analysis
of more than the hazard component (Blaikie et al., 1994). Further, it
demonstrated how crossing disciplinary and other boundaries (e.g.,
those separating disaster and development, or developed and developing
countries) can be fruitful in better understanding extremes of various
kinds (see Hewitt, 1983). If we consider food security/vulnerability (as
just one example), an inclusive analysis of the vulnerability of food
systems (to put it broadly), must take account of aspects related to, inter
alia: physical location in susceptible areas; political economy (Watts and
Bohle, 1993); entitlements in access to resources (Sen, 1981); social
capital and networks (Eriksen et al., 2005); landscape ecology (Fraser,
2006); human ecology (Bohle et al., 1994); and political ecology (Pulwarty
and Riebsame, 1997; Holling, 2001; see Chapter 4 for further discussion
of food systems and food security). More generally, in relation to hazards,
disaster risk reduction, and climate extremes, productive advances have
been made in research adopting a coupled human/social-environment
systems approach (Holling, 2001; Turner et al., 2003b) which recognizes
the importance of integrating often separate domains. For example, in
analyzing climate change impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation in
Norway, O’Brien et al. (2006) argue that a simple examination of direct
climate change impacts underestimates the, perhaps more serious and
larger, synergistic impacts. They use an example of projected climate

the identification and assessment of risk, exposure, and vulnerability
needs also to deal with different time scales and in some cases might

change scenarios focus on climatic change within the next 100 or
200 years, while often the projections of vulnerability just use present
socioeconomic data. However, a key challenge for enhancing knowledge
of exposure and vulnerability as key determinants of risk requires
improved data and methods to project and identify directions and
different development pathways in demographic, socioeconomic, and
political trends that can adequately illustrate potential increases or
decreases in vulnerability with the same time horizon as the changes in

"The timing of events may also create ‘windows of vulnerability,’ periods in
which the hazards are greater because of the conjunction of circumstances
(Dow, 1992). Time is a cross-cutting dimension that always needs to be
considered but particularly so in the case of anthropogenic climate change,
which may be projected some years into the future (Ftissel, 2005). In
fact, this time dimension is regarded (Thomalla et al., 2006) as a key
difference between the disaster management and climate change
communities. To generalize somewhat, the former group typically
(with obvious exceptions like slow-onset hazards such as drought or
desertification) deals with fast-onset events, in discrete, even if extensive,
locations, requiring immediate action. The latter group typically focuses on
conditions that occur in a dispersed form over lengthy time periods and
which are much more challenging in their identification and measurement
(Thomalla et al., 2006). Risk perception may be reduced (Leiserowitz,
2006) for such events remote in time and/or space, such as some climate
change impacts are perceived to be. Thus, in this conceptualization,
different time scales are an important constraint when dealing with the
link between disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation (see

Spatial and functional scales are another cross-cutting theme that is of
particular relevance when dealing with the identification of exposure and
vulnerability to extreme events and climate change. Leichenko and O’Brien
(2002) conclude that in many areas of climate change and natural hazards
societies are confronted with dynamic vulnerability, meaning that
processes and factors that cause vulnerability operate simultaneously at
multiple scales making traditional indicators insufficient. Leichenko and
O'Brien (2002) analyze a complex mix of influences (both positive and
negative) on the vulnerability, and coping and adaptive capacity of
southern African farmers in dealing with climate variability. These
include the impacts of globalization on national-level policies and local-
level experiences (e.g., structural adjustment programs reducing local-
level agricultural subsidies on the one hand, and on the other, trade
liberalization measures opening up new opportunities through
diversification of production in response to drought). Also Turner et al.
(2003a,b) stress that vulnerability and resilience assessments need to
consider the influences on vulnerability from different scales, however,
the practical application and analysis of these interacting influences on
vulnerability from different spatial scales is a major challenge and in most
cases not sufficiently understood. Furthermore, vulnerability analysis
particularly linked to the identification of institutional vulnerability has
also to take into account the various functional scales that climate
change, natural hazards, and vulnerability as well as administrative
systems operate on. In most cases, current disaster management
instruments and measures of urban or spatial planning as well as water
management tools (specific plans, zoning, norms) operate on different
functional scales compared to climate change. Even the various hazards
that climate change may modify encompass different functional scales
that cannot be sufficiently captured with one approach. For example,
policy setting and management of climate change and of disaster risk
reduction are usually the responsibility of different institutions or
departments, thus it is a challenge to develop a coherent and integrated
strategy (Birkmann and von Teichman, 2010). Consequently, functional
and spatial scale mismatches might even be part of institutional
vulnerabilities that limit the ability of governance system to adequately
respond to hazards and changes induced by climate change.

Pohl, 2007). In contrast, the disaster risk research community views risk
as the product of the interaction of a potentially damaging event and
the vulnerable conditions of a society or element exposed (UNISDR,

"To inform risk management, it is desirable that risk assessments are
locally based and result in increased awareness and a sense of local
ownership of the process and the options that may be employed to
address the risks. Several participatory risk assessment methods, often
based on participatory rural appraisal methods, have been adjusted to
explicitly address changing risks in a changing climate. Examples of
guidance on how to assess climate vulnerability at the community level
are available from several sources (see Willows and Connell, 2003;
Moench and Dixit, 2007; van Aalst et al., 2007; CARE, 2009; IISD et al.,
2009; Tearfund, 2009). In integrating climate change, a balance needs to
be struck between the desire for a sophisticated assessment that includes
high-quality scientific inputs and rigorous analysis of the participatory
findings, and the need to keep the process simple, participatory, and
implementable at scale. Chapter 5 provides further details on the
implementation of risk management at local levels.

"However, quantitative approaches for assessing vulnerability need to be
complemented with qualitative approaches to capture the full complexity
and the various tangible and intangible aspects of vulnerability in its
different dimensions. It is important to recognize that complex systems
involve multiple variables (physical, social, cultural, economic, and
environmental) that cannot be measured using the same methodology.
Physical or material reality have a harder topology that allows the use
of quantitative measure, while collective and historical reality have a
softer topology in which the majority of the attributes are described in
qualitative terms (Munda, 2000). These aspects indicate that a weighing
or measurement of risk involves the integration of diverse disciplinary
perspectives. An integrated and interdisciplinary focus can more
consistently take into account the nonlinear relations of the parameters,
the context, complexity, and dynamics of social and environmental systems,
and contribute to more effective risk management by the different
stakeholders involved in risk reduction or adaptation decisionmaking.
Results can be verified and risk management/adaptation priorities can
be established (Carrefio et al., 2007a, 2009).

"Taking into account epistemic and aleatory uncertainties the probabilistic
estimations of risk attempt to forecast damage or losses even where
insufficient data are available on the hazards and the system being
analyzed (UNDRO, 1980; Fournier d’Albe, 1985; Spence and Coburn,
1987; Blockley, 1992; Coburn and Spence, 1992; Sheldon and Golding,
1992; Woo, 1999; Grossi and Kunreuther, 2005; Cardona et al., 2008a,b;
Cardona 2011). In most cases, approaches and criteria for simplification
and for aggregation of different information types and sources are used,
due to a lack of data or the inherent low resolution of the information. This
can result in some scientific or technical and econometric characteristics,
accuracy, and completeness that are desirable features when the risk
evaluation is the goal of the process (Cardona et al., 2003b). Measures
such as loss exceedance curves and probable maximum loss for different
event return periods are of particular importance for the stratification of
risk and the design of disaster risk intervention strategy considering risk
reduction, prevention, and transfer (Woo, 1999; Grossi and Kunreuther,
2005; Cardona et al., 2008a,b; ERN-AL, 2011; UNISDR, 2011). However,
it is also evident that more qualitative-oriented risk assessment
approaches are focusing on deterministic approaches and the profiling
of vulnerability using participatory methodologies (Garret, 1999).

"The International Standards Organization defines risk assessment as a
process to comprehend the nature of risk and to determine the level of
risk (ISO, 2009a,b). Additionally, communication within risk assessment
and management are seen as key elements of the process (Renn, 2008).
More specifically, vulnerability and risk assessment deal with the
identification of different facets and factors of vulnerability and risk, by
means of gathering and systematizing data and information, in order to
be able to identify and evaluate different levels of vulnerability and risk
of societies — social groups and infrastructures — or coupled socio-
ecological systems at risk. A common goal of vulnerability and risk
assessment approaches is to provide information about profiles, patterns
of, and changes in risk and vulnerability (see, e.g., IDEA, 2005; Birkmann,
2006a; Cardona, 2008; IFRC, 2008), in order to define priorities, select
alternative strategies, or formulate new response strategies. In this
context, the Hyogo Framework for Action stresses “that the starting
point for reducing disaster risk and for promoting a culture of disaster
resilience lies in the knowledge of the hazards and the physical, social,
economic, and environmental vulnerabilities to disasters that most
societies face, and of the ways in which hazards and vulnerabilities are
changing in the short and long term, followed by action taken on the
basis of that knowledge” (UN, 2005).

"The Prevalent Vulnerability Index (PVI) depicts predominant vulnerability conditions of the countries over time to identify progresses and
regressions. It provides a measure of direct effects (as result of exposure and susceptibility) as well as indirect and intangible effects of
hazard events (as result of socioeconomic fragilities and lack of resilience). The indicators used are made up of a set of demographic,
socioeconomic, and environmental national indicators that reflect situations, causes, susceptibilities, weaknesses, or relative absences of
development affecting the country under study. The indicators are selected based on existing indices, figures, or rates available from
reliable worldwide databases or data provided by each country. These vulnerability conditions underscore the relationship between risk
and development. Figure 2-1 shows the aggregated PVI (Exposure, Social Fragility, Lack of Resilience) for 2007.

"Vulnerability and therefore risk are also the result of unsustainable economic growth and deficiencies that may be corrected by means of
adequate development processes, reducing susceptibility of exposed assets, socioeconomic fragilities, and improving capacities and
resilience of society (IDB, 2007). The information provided by an index such as the PVI can prove useful to ministries of housing and
urban development, environment, agriculture, health and social welfare, economy, and planning. The main advantage of PVI lies in its
ability to disaggregate results and identify factors that may take priority in risk management actions as corrective and prospective measures
or interventions of vulnerability from a development point of view. The PVI can be used at different territorial levels, however often the
indicators used by the PVI are only available at the national level; this is a limitation for its application at other sub-national scales.

extreme impact occurs (demand for contingent resources) and the public sector's economic resilience — that is, the availability of funds

figure is interesting and useful for a Ministry of Finance and Economics. It is related to the potential financial sustainability problem of
the country regarding the potential disasters. On the other hand, the DDI gives a compressed picture of the fiscal vulnerability of the
country due to extreme impacts. The DDI has been a guide for economic risk management; the results at national and sub-national levels
can be studied by economic, financial, and planning analysts, who can evaluate the potential budget problem and the need to take into

"Assessment frameworks with integrative and holistic perspectives have
been developed by Turner et al. (2003a), Birkmann (2006b), and Cardona
(2001). Key elements of these holistic views are the identification of
causal linkages between factors of vulnerability and risk and the
interventions (structural, non-structural) that nations, societies, and
communities or individuals make to reduce their vulnerability or exposure
to hazards. Turner et al. (2003a) underline the need to focus on different
scales simultaneously, in order to capture the linkages between different
scales (local, national, regional, etc.). The influences and linkages
between different scales can be difficult to capture, especially due to
their dynamic nature during and after disasters, for example, through
inputs of external disaster aid (Cardona, 1999a,b; Cardona and Barbat,
2000; Turner et al., 2003a; Carrefio et al., 2005, 2007a, 2009; IDEA,

"Several methods have been proposed to measure vulnerability from a
comprehensive and multidisciplinary perspective. In some cases composite
indices or indicators intend to capture favorable conditions for direct
physical impacts — such as exposure and susceptibility — as well as indirect
or intangible impacts of hazard events — such as socio-ecological fragilities
or lack of resilience (IDEA, 2005; Cardona, 2006; Carrefio et al., 2007a).
In these holistic approaches, exposure and physical susceptibility are
representing the ‘hard’ and hazard-dependent conditions of vulnerability.
On the other hand, the propensity to suffer negative impacts as a result
of the socio-ecological fragilities and not being able to adequately cope
and anticipate future disasters can be considered ‘soft’ and usually
non-hazard dependent conditions, that aggravate the impact. Box 2-3
describes two of these approaches, based on relative indicators, useful
for monitoring vulnerability of countries over time and to communicate
it to country’s development and financial authorities in their own

"To enhance disaster risk management and climate change adaptation,
risk identification and vulnerability assessment may be undertaken in
different phases, that is, before, during, and even after disasters occur.
This includes, for instance, the evaluation of the continued viability of
measures taken and the need for further or different adaptation/risk
management measures. Although risk and vulnerability reduction are the
primary actions to be conducted before disasters occur, it is important
to acknowledge that ex post and forensic studies of disasters provide a
laboratory in which to study risk and disasters as well as vulnerabilities
revealed (see Birkmann and Fernando, 2008; ICSU-LAC, 2011a,b).
Disasters draw attention to how societies and socio-ecological processes
are changing and acting in crises and catastrophic situations, particularly
regarding the reconfiguration of access to different assets or the role
of social networks and formal organizations (see Bohle, 2008). It is
noteworthy that, until today, many post-disaster processes and strategies
have failed to integrate aspects of climate change adaptation and long-
term risk reduction (see Birkmann et al., 2009, 2010a).
"	Text
"There is medium evidence (given the generally limited amount of
long-term evaluations of impacts of adaptation and risk management
interventions and complications associated with such assessments), but
high agreement that adaptation and risk management policies and
practices will be more successful if they take the dynamic nature of
vulnerability and exposure into account, including the explicit
characterization of uncertainty and complexity (Cardona 2001, 2011;
Hilhorst, 2004, ICSU-LAC, 2010, Pelling, 2010). Projections of the impacts
of climate change can be strengthened by including storylines of changing
vulnerability and exposure under different development pathways.
Appropriate attention to the dynamics of vulnerability and exposure is
particularly important given that the design and implementation of
adaptation and risk management strategies and policies can reduce risk
in the short term, but may increase vulnerability and exposure over the
longer term. For instance, dike systems can reduce hazard exposure by
offering immediate protection, but also encourage settlement patterns
that may increase risk in the long term. For instance, in the 40-year span
between Hurricanes Betsy and Katrina, protective works — new and
improved levees, drainage pumps, and canals — successfully protected
New Orleans and surrounding parishes against three hurricanes in 1985,
1997, and 1998. These works were the basis for the catastrophe of
Katrina, having enabled massive development of previously unprotected
areas and the flooding of these areas that resulted when the works
themselves were shown to be inadequate (Colten et al., 2008). For other
examples, see Décamps (2010).

of multi-hazard risks is key for risk management and climate change
adaptation (see Grothmann and Patt 2005; van Aalst et al., 2008).

risk in specific locations, often due to a combination of processes, some
persistent and/or gradual, others more erratic, often in a combination of
exacerbation of inequality, marginalization, and disaster risk over time
(Maskrey, 1993b; Lavell, 1994). It also reflects that the impacts of one
hazard — and the response to it — can have implications for how the
next hazard plays out. This is well illustrated by the example of El
Salvador, where people living in temporary shelters after the 1998
Hurricane Mitch were at greater risk during the 2001 earthquakes due
to the poor construction of the shelters (Wisner, 2001b). The concept of

"reliability, relevance, and weight of competing knowledge claims (Jasanoff
and Wynne, 1997). ‘Early warning’ implies information interventions
into an environment in which much about vulnerability is assumed. In
this regard, risk communication is not solely linked to a top-down
communication process, rather effective risk communication requires
recognition of communication as a social process meaning that risk
communication also deals with local risk perceptions and local framing
of risk. Risk communication thus functions also as a tool to upscale local
knowledge and needs (bottom-up approach). Therefore, effective risk
communication achieves both informing people at risk about the key
determinants of their particular risks and of impending disaster risk (early
warning), and also engages different stakeholders in the definition of a
problem and the identification of respective solutions (see van Aalst et al.,
2008).

"Risk communication is a complex cross-disciplinary field that involves
reaching different audiences to make risk comprehensible, understanding
and respecting audience values, predicting the audience's response to
the communication, and improving awareness and collective and
individual decisionmaking (e.g., Cardona, 1996c; Mileti, 1996; Greiving,
2002; Renn, 2008). Risk communication failures have been revealed in
past disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 or the Pakistan floods
in 2010 (DKKV, 2011). Particularly, the loss of trust in official institutions
responsible for early warning and disaster management were a key
factor that contributed to the increasing disaster risk. Effective and
people-centered risk communication is therefore a key to improve
vulnerability and risk reduction in the context of extreme events,
particularly in the context of people-centered early warning (DKKV,
2011). Weak and insufficient risk communication as well as the loss of
trust in government institutions in the context of early warning or climate
change adaptation can be seen as a core component of institutional
vulnerability.

"Climate change adaptation strategies as well as disaster risk reduction
approaches need public interest, leadership, and acceptance. The
generation and receipt of risk information occurs through a diverse array
of channels. Chapter 5 and others discuss the important role of mass
media and other sources (see, e.g., the case of Japan provided in Sampei
and Aoyagi-Usui, 2009). Within the context of risk communication,
particularly in terms of climate change and disasters, decisionmakers,
scientists, and NGOs have to act in accordance with media requirements
concerning news production, public discourse, and media consumption
(see Carvalho and Burgess, 2005). Carvalho (2005) and Olausson (2009)
underline that mass media is often closely linked to political awareness
and is framed by its own journalistic norms and priorities; that means
also that mass media provides little space for alternative frames of
communicating climate change (Carvalho, 2005; Olausson, 2009).
Boykoff and Boykoff (2007) conclude that this process might also lead
to an informational bias, especially toward the presentation of events
instead of a comprehensive analysis of the problem. Thus, an important
aspect of improving risk communication and the respective knowledge
base is the acceptance and admission of the limits of knowledge about
the future (see Birkmann and von Teichman, 2010).

"disaster risk. Sometimes, however, disasters themselves can be a
window of opportunity for addressing the determinants of disaster risk.
With proactive risk assessment and reconstruction planning, more
appropriate solutions can be realized while restoring essential assets
and services during and after disasters (Susman et al., 1983, Renn,
1992; Comfort et al., 1999; Vogel and O’Brien, 2004).
"	Text
"Disaster risk is not an autonomous or externally generated circumstance
to which society reacts, adapts, or responds (as is the case with natural
phenomena or events per se), but rather the result of the interaction of
society and the natural or built environment. Thus disasters are often
the product of parallel developments that sometimes reach a tipping
point, where the cumulative effect of these parallel processes results in
disaster (Dikau and Pohl, 2007; Birkmann, 2011b). After that point,
recovery may be slowed by conflict between processes and goals of
reconstruction (Colten et al., 2008). In addition, there is often strong
pressure to restore the status quo as soon as possible after a disaster
has happened, even if that status quo means continued high levels of
"	Text
"A context-based understanding of these risks is essential to identify
appropriate risk management strategies. This may include better collection
of sub-national disaster data that allows visualization of complex patterns
of local risk (UNDP, 2004), as well as locally owned processes of risk
identification and reduction. Bull-Kamanga et al. (2003) suggest that
one of the most effective methods to address urban disaster risk in
Africa is to support community processes among the most vulnerable
groups so they can identify risks and set priorities — both for community
action and for action by external agencies (including local governments).
Such local risk assessment processes also avoid the pitfalls of planning
based on dated maps used to plan and develop large physical construction
and facilities.
"	Text
"Risk accumulation can be driven by underlying factors such as a decline
in the regulatory services provided by ecosystems, inadequate water
management, land use changes, rural-urban migration, unplanned
urban growth, the expansion of informal settlements in low-lying areas,
and an underinvestment in drainage infrastructure. Development and
governance processes that increase the marginalization of specific
groups, for example, through the reduction of access to health services
or the exclusion from information and power — to name just a few — can
also severely increase the susceptibility of these groups and at the same
time erode societal response capacities. The classic example is disaster
risk in urban areas in many rapidly growing cities in developing countries
(Pelling and Wisner, 2009b). In these areas, disaster risk is often very
unequally distributed, with the poor facing the highest risk, for instance
because they live in the most hazard-prone parts of the city, often in
unplanned dense settlements with a lack of public services; where lack
of waste disposal may lead to blocking of drains and increases the risk
of disease outbreaks when floods occur; with limited political influence
to ensure government interventions to reduce risk. The accumulation of
disaster risk over time may be partly caused by a string of smaller
disasters due to continued exposure to small day-to-day risks in urban
areas (e.g., Pelling and Wisner, 2009a), aggravated by limited resources
to cope and recover from disasters when they occur — creating a vicious
cycle of poverty and disaster risk. Analysis of disaster loss data suggests
that frequent low-intensity losses often highlight an accumulation of risks,
which is then realized when an extreme hazard event occurs (UNISDR,
2009a). Similar accumulation of risk may occur at larger scales in hazard-
prone states, especially in the context of conflict and displacement (e.g.,
UNDP, 2004).

"Many weather and climate extremes are the result of natural climate variability (including phenomena
such as EI Nifio), and natural decadal or multi-decadal variations in the climate provide the backdrop for
anthropogenic climate changes. Even if there were no anthropogenic changes in climate, a wide variety of natural
weather and climate extremes would still occur. [3.1]
"	Text
"A changing climate leads to changes in the frequency, intensity, spatial extent, duration, and timing of
weather and climate extremes, and can result in unprecedented extremes. Changes in extremes can also be
directly related to changes in mean climate, because mean future conditions in some variables are projected to lie
within the tails of present-day conditions. Nevertheless, changes in extremes of a climate or weather variable are not
always related in a simple way to changes in the mean of the same variable, and in some cases can be of opposite
sign to a change in the mean of the variable. Changes in phenomena such as the El Nifio-Southern Oscillation or
monsoons could affect the frequency and intensity of extremes in several regions simultaneously. [3.1]
"	Text
"This chapter addresses changes in weather and climate events relevant to extreme impacts and disasters.
An extreme (weather or climate) event is generally defined as the occurrence of a value of a weather or climate
variable above (or below) a threshold value near the upper (or lower) ends (‘tails’) of the range of observed values of
the variable. Some climate extremes (e.g., droughts, floods) may be the result of an accumulation of weather or climate
events that are, individually, not extreme themselves (though their accumulation is extreme). As well, weather or
climate events, even if not extreme in a statistical sense, can still lead to extreme conditions or impacts, either by
crossing a critical threshold in a social, ecological, or physical system, or by occurring simultaneously with other
events. A weather system such as a tropical cyclone can have an extreme impact, depending on where and when it
approaches landfall, even if the specific cyclone is not extreme relative to other tropical cyclones. Conversely, not all
extremes necessarily lead to serious impacts. [3.1]
"	Text
"Many factors affect confidence in observed and projected changes in extremes. Our confidence in observed
changes in extremes depends on the quality and quantity of available data and the availability of studies analyzing
these data. It consequently varies between regions and for different extremes. Similarly, our confidence in projecting
changes (including the direction and magnitude of changes in extremes) varies with the type of extreme, as well as
the considered region and season, depending on the amount and quality of relevant observational data and model
projections, the level of understanding of the underlying processes, and the reliability of their simulation in models
(assessed from expert judgment, model validation, and model agreement). Global-scale trends in a specific extreme
may be either more reliable (e.g., for temperature extremes) or less reliable (e.g., for droughts) than some regional-
scale trends, depending on the geographical uniformity of the trends in the specific extreme. ‘Low confidence’ in
observed or projected changes in a specific extreme neither implies nor excludes the possibility of changes in this
extreme. [3.1.5, 3.1.6, 3.2.3; Box 3-2; Figures 3-3, 3-4, 3-5, 3-6, 3-7, 3-8, 3-10]

"There is evidence from observations gathered since 1950 of change in some extremes. It is very likely that
there has been an overall decrease in the number of cold days and nights, and an overall increase in the number of
warm days and nights, at the global scale, that is, for most land areas with sufficient data. It is likely that these change:
have also occurred at the continental scale in North America, Europe, and Australia. There is medium confidence of a
warming trend in daily temperature extremes in much of Asia. Confidence in observed trends in daily temperature
extremes in Africa and South America generally varies from low to medium depending on the region. Globally, in many
(but not all) regions with sufficient data there is medium confidence that the length or number of warm spells or heat
waves has increased since the middle of the 20th century. It is /ikely that there have been statistically significant
increases in the number of heavy precipitation events (e.g., 95th percentile) in more regions than there have been
statistically significant decreases, but there are strong regional and subregional variations in the trends. There is

low confidence that any observed long-term (i.e., 40 years or more) increases in tropical cyclone activity are robust,
after accounting for past changes in observing capabilities. It is /ikely that there has been a poleward shift in the
main Northern and Southern Hemisphere extratropical storm tracks. There is low confidence in observed trends in

"Models project substantial warming in temperature extremes by the end of the 21st century. It is virtually
certain that increases in the frequency and magnitude of warm daily temperature extremes and decreases in cold
extremes will occur through the 21st century at the global scale. It is very likely that the length, frequency, and/or
intensity of warm spells or heat waves will increase over most land areas. For the Special Report on Emissions
Scenarios (SRES) A2 and A1B emission scenarios, a 1-in-20 year annual hottest day is likely to become a 1-in-2 year
annual extreme by the end of the 21st century in most regions, except in the high latitudes of the Northern
Hemisphere where it is /ikely to become a 1-in-5 year annual extreme. In terms of absolute values, 20-year extreme
annual daily maximum temperature (ie., return value) will /ikely increase by about 1 to 3°C by mid-21st century and
by about 2 to 5°C by the late 21st century, depending on the region and emissions scenario (considering the B1, A1B,

"There is evidence that some extremes have changed as a result of anthropogenic influences, including
increases in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. It is /ikely that anthropogenic influences have led
to warming of extreme daily minimum and maximum temperatures at the global scale. There is medium confidence
that anthropogenic influences have contributed to intensification of extreme precipitation at the global scale. It is
likely that there has been an anthropogenic influence on increasing extreme coastal high water due to an increase in
mean sea level. The uncertainties in the historical tropical cyclone records, the incomplete understanding of the physical
mechanisms linking tropical cyclone metrics to climate change, and the degree of tropical cyclone variability provide
only low confidence for the attribution of any detectable changes in tropical cyclone activity to anthropogenic
influences. Attribution of single extreme events to anthropogenic climate change is challenging. [3.2.2, 3.3.1, 3.3.2,

"small-scale phenomena such as tornadoes and hail because of data inhomogeneities and inadequacies in monitoring
systems. There is medium confidence that since the 1950s some regions of the world have experienced a trend to
more intense and longer droughts, in particular in southern Europe and West Africa, but in some regions droughts
have become less frequent, less intense, or shorter, for example, in central North America and northwestern Australia.
There is limited to medium evidence available to assess climate-driven observed changes in the magnitude and
frequency of floods at regional scales because the available instrumental records of floods at gauge stations are limited
in space and time, and because of confounding effects of changes in land use and engineering. Furthermore, there is
low agreement in this evidence, and thus overall low confidence at the global scale regarding even the sign of these
changes. It is /ikely that there has been an increase in extreme coastal high water related to increases in mean sea
level in the late 20th century. [3.2.1, 3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.4.4, 3.4.5, 3.5.1, 3.5.2, 3.5.3; Tables 3-1, 3-2]

"The following assessments of the likelihood of and/or confidence in projections are generally for the end
of the 21st century and relative to the climate at the end of the 20th century. There are three main sources of
uncertainty in the projections: the natural variability of climate; uncertainties in climate model parameters and
structure; and projections of future emissions. Projections for differing emissions scenarios generally do not strongly
diverge in the coming two to three decades, but uncertainty in the sign of change is relatively large over this time
frame because climate change signals are expected to be relatively small compared to natural climate variability. For
certain extremes (e.g., precipitation-related extremes), the uncertainty in projected changes by the end of the 21st
century is more the result of uncertainties in climate models rather than uncertainties in future emissions. For other
extremes (in particular temperature extremes at the global scale and in most regions), the emissions uncertainties are
the main source of uncertainty in projections for the end of the 21st century. In the assessments provided in this
chapter, uncertainties in projections from the direct evaluation of multi-model ensemble projections are modified by
taking into account the past performance of models in simulating extremes (for instance, simulations of late 20th-
century changes in extreme temperatures appear to overestimate the observed warming of warm extremes and
underestimate the warming of cold extremes), the possibility that some important processes relevant to extremes may
be missing or be poorly represented in models, and the limited number of model projections and corresponding
analyses currently available of extremes. For these reasons the assessed uncertainty is generally greater than would be
assessed from the model projections alone. Low-probability, high-impact changes associated with the crossing of
poorly understood climate thresholds cannot be excluded, given the transient and complex nature of the climate
system. Feedbacks play an important role in either damping or enhancing extremes in several climate variables.

being equal. There is Jow confidence in wave height projections because of the small number of studies, the lack of
consistency of the wind projections between models, and limitations in the models’ ability to simulate extreme winds.
Future negative or positive changes in significant wave height are /ikely to reflect future changes in storminess and
associated patterns of wind change. [3.5.3, 3.5.4, 3.5.5]

"Uncertainty in projections of changes in large-scale patterns of natural climate variability remains large.
There is low confidence in projections of changes in monsoons (rainfall, circulation), because there is little consensus
in climate models regarding the sign of future change in the monsoons. Model projections of changes in El Nifio-
Southern Oscillation variability and the frequency of El Nifio episodes as a consequence of increased greenhouse gas
concentrations are not consistent, and so there is low confidence in projections of changes in the phenomenon.
However, most models project an increase in the relative frequency of central equatorial Pacific events (which typically
exhibit different patterns of climate variations than do the classical East Pacific events). There is low confidence in the
ability to project changes in other natural climate modes including the North Atlantic Oscillation, the Southern Annular
Mode, and the Indian Ocean Dipole. [3.4.1, 3.4.2, 3.4.3]

"It is likely that the frequency of heavy precipitation or the proportion of total rainfall from heavy rainfalls
will increase in the 21st century over many areas of the globe. This is particularly the case in the high latitudes
and tropical regions, and in winter in the northern mid-latitudes. Heavy rainfalls associated with tropical cyclones are
likely to increase with continued warming induced by enhanced greenhouse gas concentrations. There is medium
confidence that, in some regions, increases in heavy precipitation will occur despite projected decreases in total
precipitation. For a range of emission scenarios (SRES A2, A1B, and B1), a 1-in-20 year annual maximum 24-hour
precipitation rate is likely to become a 1-in-5 to 1-in-15 year event by the end of the 21st century in many regions,
and in most regions the higher emissions scenarios (A1B and A2) lead to a greater projected decrease in return
period. Nevertheless, increases or statistically non-significant changes in return periods are projected in some regions.

studies of projected extreme winds, and shortcomings in the simulation of these events. An exception is
mean tropical cyclone maximum wind speed, which is /ikely to increase, although increases may not occur in all ocean
basins. It is likely that the global frequency of tropical cyclones will either decrease or remain essentially unchanged.
There is low confidence in projections of small-scale phenomena such as tornadoes because competing physical
processes may affect future trends and because climate models do not simulate such phenomena. There is medium
confidence that there will be a reduction in the number of mid-latitude cyclones averaged over each hemisphere due
to future anthropogenic climate change. There is low confidence in the detailed geographical projections of mid-latitude
cyclone activity. There is medium confidence in a projected poleward shift of mid-latitude storm tracks due to future
anthropogenic forcings. [3.3.3, 3.4.4, 3.4.5]

low confidence because of inconsistent projections of drought changes (dependent both on model and dryness index).

local geological conditions and other non-climatic factors. There is ow confidence in projections of an anthropogenic

"The small land area and often low elevation of small island states make them particularly vulnerable to
rising sea levels and impacts such as inundation, shoreline change, and saltwater intrusion into

small island states limit the assessment of changes in extremes. There is insufficient evidence to assess observed
trends and future projections in rainfall across the small island regions considered here. There is medium confidence in
projected temperature increases across the Caribbean. The very likely contribution of mean sea level rise to increased
extreme coastal high water levels, coupled with the /ikely increase in tropical cyclone maximum wind speed, is a

"A changing climate leads to changes in the frequency, intensity, spatial
extent, duration, and timing of weather and climate extremes, and can
result in unprecedented extremes (Sections 3.1.7, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5). As
well, weather or climate events, even if not extreme in a statistical sense,
can still lead to extreme conditions or impacts, either by crossing a critical
threshold in a social, ecological, or physical system, or by occurring
simultaneously with other events (Sections 3.1.2, 3.1.3, 3.1.4, 3.3, 3.4,
and 3.5). Some climate extremes (e.g., droughts, floods) may be the result
of an accumulation of weather or climate events that are, individually,
not extreme themselves (though their accumulation is extreme, e.g.,
Section 3.1.2). A weather system such as a tropical cyclone can have an
extreme impact, depending on where and when it approaches landfall,
even if the specific cyclone is not extreme relative to other tropical
cyclones. Conversely, not all extremes necessarily lead to serious impacts.
Changes in extremes can also be directly related to changes in mean
climate, because mean future conditions in some variables are projected
to lie within the tails of present-day conditions (Section 3.1.6). Hence,
the definition of extreme weather and climate events is complex
(Section 3.1.2 and Box 3-1) and the assessment of changes in climate
that are relevant to extreme impacts and disasters needs to consider
several aspects. Those related to vulnerability and exposure are
addressed in Chapters 2 and 4 of this report, while we focus here on the
physical dimension of these events.
"	Text
"on the natural physical environment,’ a specific distinction between
these events and those considered under ‘extremes of atmospheric
weather and climate variables’ is that they are not caused by variations
in a single atmospheric weather and climate variable, but are generally
the result of specific conditions in several variables, as well as of some
surface properties or states. For instance, both floods and droughts are
related to precipitation extremes, but are also impacted by other
atmospheric and surface conditions (and are thus often better viewed as
compound events, see Section 3.1.3). Most of the impacts on the natural
physical environment discussed in the third category are extremes
themselves, as well as often being caused or affected by atmospheric
weather or climate extremes. Another arbitrary choice made here is the
separate category for phenomena (or climate or weather systems) that
are related to weather and climate extremes, such as monsoons, El Nifio,
and other modes of variability. These phenomena affect the large-scale
environment that, in turn, influences extremes. For instance, El Nifio
episodes typically lead to droughts in some regions with, simultaneously,
heavy rains and floods occurring elsewhere. This means that all
occurrences of El Nifio are relevant to extremes and not only extreme
EI Nifio episodes. A change in the frequency or nature of El Nifio episodes
(or in their relationships with climate in specific regions) would affect
extremes in many locations simultaneously. Similarly, changes in monsoon
patterns could affect several countries simultaneously. This is especially
important from an international disaster perspective because coping
with disasters in several regions simultaneously may be challenging
(see also Section 3.1.3 and Chapters 7 and 8).

"This report defines an ‘extreme climate or weather event’ or ‘climate
extreme’ as “the occurrence of a value of a weather or climate variable
above (or below) a threshold value near the upper (or lower) ends of the
range of observed values of the variable” (see Glossary). Several
aspects of this definition can be clarified thus:

even lower chance of occurrence for a given time of the year (day,
month, season, whole year) during a specified reference period
(generally 1961-1990) are often used. In some circumstances,
information from sources other than observations, such as model
projections, can be used as a reference.
"	List
"¢ Absolute thresholds (rather than these relative thresholds based
on the range of observed values of a variable) can also be used to
identify extreme events (e.g., specific critical temperatures for
health impacts).

© What is called an extreme weather or climate event will vary from
place to place in an absolute sense (e.g., a hot day in the tropics
will be a different temperature than a hot day in the mid-latitudes),
and possibly in time given some adaptation from society (see
Box 3-1).

© Some climate extremes (e.g., droughts, floods) may be the result
of an accumulation of moderate weather or climate events (this
accumulation being itself extreme). Compound events (see Section
3.1.3), that is, two or more events occurring simultaneously, can
lead to high impacts, even if the two single events are not extreme
per se (only their combination).
"	List
"Extreme Value Theory is an approach used for the estimation of extreme values (e.g., Coles, 2001), which aims at deriving a probability
distribution of events from the tail of a probability distribution, that is, at the far end of the upper or lower ranges of the probability
distributions (typically occurring less frequently than once per year or per period of interest, i.e., generally less than 1 to 5% of the
considered overall sample). EVT is used to derive a complete probability distribution for such low-probability events, which can also help
analyzing the probability of occurrence of events that are outside of the observed data range (with limitations). Two different approaches
can be used to estimate the parameters for such probability distributions. In the block maximum approach, the probability distribution
parameters are estimated for maximum values of consecutive blocks of a time series (e.g., years). In the second approach, instead of the
block maxima the estimation is based on events that exceed a high threshold (peaks over threshold approach). Both approaches are
used in climate research.

 
"	Text
"A large amount of the available scientific literature on climate extremes is based on the use of so-called ‘extreme indices,’ which can
either be based on the probability of occurrence of given quantities or on threshold exceedances (Section 3.1.2). Typical indices that are
seen in the scientific literature include the number, percentage, or fraction of days with maximum temperature (Tmax) or minimum
temperature (Tmin), below the 1st, 5th, or 10th percentile, or above the 90th, 95th, or 99th percentile, generally defined for given time
frames (days, month, season, annual) with respect to the 1961-1990 reference time period. Commonly, indices for 10th and 90th
percentiles of Tmax/Tmin computed on daily time frames are referred to as ‘cold/warm days/nights’ (e.g., Figures 3-3 and 3-4; Tables 3-1
to 3-3, and Section 3.3.1; see also Glossary). Other definitions relate to, for example, the number of days above specific absolute
temperature or precipitation thresholds, or more complex definitions related to the length or persistence of climate extremes. Some
advantages of using predefined extreme indices are that they allow some comparability across modelling and observational studies and
across regions (although with limitations noted below). Moreover, in the case of observations, derived indices may be easier to obtain
than is the case with daily temperature and precipitation data, which are not always distributed by meteorological services. Peterson and
Manton (2008) discuss collaborative international efforts to monitor extremes by employing extreme indices. Typically, although not
exclusively, extreme indices used in the scientific literature reflect ‘moderate extremes,’ for example, events occurring as often as 5 or 10%
of the time. More extreme ‘extremes’ are often investigated using Extreme Value Theory (EVT) due to sampling issues (see below).
Extreme indices are often defined for daily temperature and precipitation characteristics, and are also sometimes applied to seasonal
characteristics of these variables, to other weather and climate variables, such as wind speed, humidity, or to physical impacts and
phenomena. Beside analyses for temperature and precipitation indices (see Sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.2; Tables 3-2 and 3-3), other studies
are, for instance, available in the literature for wind-based (Della-Marta et al., 2009) and pressure-based (Beniston, 2009a) indices, for
health-relevant indices (e.g., ‘heat index’) combining temperature and relative humidity characteristics (e.g., Diffenbaugh et al., 2007;
Fischer and Schar, 2010; Sherwood and Huber, 2010), and for a range of dryness indices (see Box 3-3).
"	Text
"From this definition, it can be seen that climate extremes can be defined
quantitatively in two ways:

"For simplicity, we collectively refer to both extreme weather events and
extreme climate events with the term ‘climate extremes’ in this chapter.

¢ An event from the extreme tails of probability distributions is not necessarily extreme in terms of impact.

the number of frost davs) will not reflect extremes in all locations and time periods (e.a.. season. decade).

"The first type of definition can either be expressed with respect to given
percentiles of the distribution functions of the variables, or with respect
to specific return frequencies (e.g., '100-year event’). Compound events
can be viewed as a special category of climate extremes, which result
from the combination of two or more events, and which are again
‘extreme’ either from a statistical perspective (tails of distribution functions
of climate variables) or associated with a specific threshold (Section
3.1.3.). These two definitions of climate extremes, probability-based or
threshold-based, are not necessarily antithetic. Indeed, hazards for
society and ecosystems are often extreme both from a probability and

"¢ Not all extreme weather and climate events necessarily have
extreme impacts.

© The distinction between extreme weather events and extreme climate
events is not precise, but is related to their specific time scales:

— An extreme weather event is typically associated with changing
weather patterns, that is, within time frames of less than a day
to a few weeks.

— An extreme climate event happens on longer time scales. It can
be the accumulation of several (extreme or non-extreme)
weather events (e.g., the accumulation of moderately below-
average rainy days over a season leading to substantially below-
average cumulated rainfall and drought conditions).
"	List
"Recent publications have used other approaches for evaluating characteristics of extremes or changes in extremes, for instance, analyzing
trends in record events or investigating whether records in observed time series are being set more or less frequently than would be
expected in an unperturbed climate (Benestad, 2003, 2006; Zorita et al., 2008; Meehl et al., 2009c; Trewin and Vermont, 2010).
Furthermore, besides the actual magnitude of extremes (quantified in terms of probability/return frequency or absolute threshold), other
relevant aspects for the definition of climate extremes from an impact perspective include the event's duration, the spatial area affected,
timing, frequency, onset date, continuity (ie, whether there are ‘breaks’ within a spell), and preconditioning (e.g., rapid transition from a
slowly developing meteorological drought into an agricultural drought, see Box 3-3). These aspects, together with seasonal variations in
climate extremes, are not as frequently examined in climate models or observational analyses, and thus can only be partly assessed
within this chapter.
"	Text
"As noted in the discussion of ‘extreme weather or climate events’ in Section 3.1.2, thresholds, percentiles, or return values used for the
definition of climate extremes are generally defined with respect to a given reference period (generally historical, ie, 1961-1990, but
possibly also based on climate model data). In some cases, a transient baseline can also be considered (i.e., the baseline uses data from
the period under examination and changes as the period being considered changes, rather than using a standard period such as
1961-1990). The choice of the reference period may be relevant for the magnitude of the assessed changes as highlighted, for example,
in Lorenz et al. (2010). The choice of the reference period (static or transient) could also affect the assessment of the respective role of
changes in mean versus changes in variability for changes in extremes discussed in Section 3.1.6. If extremes are based on the probability
distribution from which they are drawn, then a simple change in the mean (and keeping the same distribution) would, strictly speaking,
produce no relative change in extremes at all. The question of the choice of an appropriate reference period is tied to the notion of
adaptation. Events that are considered extreme nowadays in some regions could possibly be adapted to if the vulnerability and exposure
to these extremes is reduced (Chapters 1, 2, and 4 through 7). However, there are also some limits to adaptation as highlighted in
Chapter 8. These considerations are difficult to include in the statistical analyses of climate scenarios because of the number of (mostly
non-physical) aspects that would need to be taken into account.

"Changes in one or more of these factors would be required for a changing
climate to induce changes in the occurrence of compound events.
Unfortunately, investigation of possible changes in these factors has
received little attention. Also, much of the analysis of changes of
extremes has, up to now, focused on individual extremes of a single
variable. However, recent literature in climate research is starting to
consider compound events and explore appropriate methods for their
analysis (e.g., Coles, 2001; Beirlant et al, 2004; Benestad and Haugen,
2007; Renard and Lang, 2007; Schdlzel and Friederichs, 2008; Beniston,
2009b; Tebaldi and Sanso, 2009; Durante and Salvadori, 2010).
"	Text
"Impacts on the physical environment (Section 3.5) are often the result
of compound events. For instance, floods will more likely occur over
saturated soils (Section 3.5.2), which means that both soil moisture
status and precipitation intensity play a role. The wet soil may itself be
the result of a number of above-average but not necessarily extreme
precipitation events, or of enhanced snow melt associated with
temperature anomalies in a given season. Similarly, droughts are the
result of pre-existing soil moisture deficits and of the accumulation of
precipitation deficits and/or evapotranspiration excesses (Box 3-3), not
all (or none) of which are necessarily extreme for a particular drought
event when considered in isolation. Also, impacts on human systems or
ecosystems (Chapter 4) can be the results of compound events, for
example, in the case of health-related impacts associated with combined
temperature and humidity conditions (Box 3-1).
"	Text
"In climate science, compound events can be (1) two or more extreme
events occurring simultaneously or successively, (2) combinations of
extreme events with underlying conditions that amplify the impact of
the events, or (3) combinations of events that are not themselves
extremes but lead to an extreme event or impact when combined. The
contributing events can be of similar (clustered multiple events) or
different type(s). There are several varieties of clustered multiple events,
such as tropical cyclones generated a few days apart with the same
path and/or intensities, which may occur if there is a tendency for
persistence in atmospheric circulation and genesis conditions. Examples
of compound events resulting from events of different types are
varied — for instance, high sea level coinciding with tropical cyclone
landfall (Section 3.4.4), or cold and dry conditions (e.g., the Mongolian
Dzud, see Case Study 9.2.4), or the impact of hot events and droughts
on wildfire (Case Study 9.2.2), or a combined risk of flooding from sea
level surges and precipitation-induced high river discharge (Svensson
and Jones, 2002; Van den Brink et al., 2005). Compound events can even
result from ‘contrasting extremes’, for example, the projected occurrence
of both droughts and heavy precipitation events in future climate in
some regions (Table 3-3).
"	Text
"A special case of compound events is related to the presence of feedbacks
within the climate system, that is, mutual interaction between several
climate processes, which can either lead to a damping (negative feedback)
or enhancement (positive feedback) of the initial response to a given
forcing (see also ‘climate feedback’ in the Glossary). Feedbacks can play
an important role in the development of extreme events, and in some
cases two (or more) climate extremes can mutually strengthen one
another. One example of positive feedback between two extremes is the
possible mutual enhancement of droughts and heat waves in transitional
regions between dry and wet climates. This feedback has been identified
as having an influence on projected changes in temperature variability
and heat wave occurrence in Central and Eastern Europe and the
Mediterranean (Seneviratne et al., 2006a; Diffenbaugh et al., 2007), and
possibly also in Britain, Eastern North America, the Amazon, and East
Asia (Brabson et al., 2005; Clark et al., 2006). Further results also suggest
that it is a relevant factor for past heat waves and temperature
extremes in Europe and the United States (Durre et al., 2000; Fischer et
al., 2007a,b; Hirschi et al., 2011). Two main mechanisms that have been
suggested to underlie this feedback are: (1) enhanced soil drying during
heat waves due to increased evapotranspiration (as a consequence of
higher vapor pressure deficit and higher incoming radiation); and (2)
higher relative heating of the air from sensible heat flux when soil
moisture deficit starts limiting evapotranspiration/latent heat flux (e.g.,
Seneviratne et al., 2010). Additionally, there may also be indirect and/or
non-local effects of dryness on heat waves through, for example,
changes in circulation patterns or dry air advection (e.g., Fischer et al.,
2007a; Vautard et al., 2007; Haarsma et al., 2009). However, the
strength of these feedbacks is still uncertain in current climate models
(eg., Clark et al., 2010), in particular if additional feedbacks with
precipitation (e.g., Koster et al., 2004b; Seneviratne et al., 2010) and
with land use and land cover state and changes (e.g., Lobell et al., 2008;
Pitman et al., 2009; Teuling et al., 2010) are considered. Also, feedbacks
between trends in snow cover and changes in temperature extremes have
been highlighted as being relevant for projections (e.g., Kharin et al.,
2007; Orlowsky and Seneviratne, 2011). Feedbacks with soil moisture

"The confidence assessments are expert-based evaluations that consider
the confidence in the tools and data basis (models, data, proxies) used
to assess or project changes in a specific element, and the associated
level of understanding. Examples of cases of low confidence for model
projections are if models display poor performance in simulating the
specific extreme in the present climate (see also Box 3-2), or if insufficient
literature on model performance is available for the specific extreme, for
example, due to lack of observations. Similarly for observed changes,
the assessment may be of /ow confidence if the available evidence is
based only on scattered data (or publications) that are insufficient to
provide a robust assessment for a large region, or the observations may
be of poor quality, not homogeneous, or only of an indirect nature
(proxies). In cases with low confidence regarding past or projected
changes in some extremes, we indicate whether the /ow confidence is
due to lack of literature, lack of evidence (data, observations), or lack of
understanding. It should be noted that there are some overlaps
between these categories, as for instance a lack of evidence can be at
the root of a lack of literature and understanding. Cases of changes in
extremes for which confidence in the models and data is rated as
‘medium’ are those where we have some confidence in the tools and
evidence available to us, but there remain substantial doubts about
some aspects of the quality of these tools. It should be noted that an

"results in differing levels of uncertainty in climate simulations and
projections for different extremes (Box 3-2). Because of these issues,
projections in some extremes are difficult or even impossible to provide,
although projections in some other extremes have a high level of
confidence. In addition, uncertainty in projections also varies over different
time frames for individual extremes, because of varying contributions
over time of internal climate variability, model uncertainty, and emission
scenario uncertainty to the overall uncertainty (Box 3-2 and Section 3.2).
Overall, we can infer that our confidence in past and future changes in
extremes varies with the type of extreme, the data available, and the
region, season, and time frame being considered, linked with the level
of understanding and reliability of simulation of the underlying physical
processes. These various aspects are addressed in more detail in Box 3-2,
Section 3.2, and the subsections on specific extremes in Sections 3.3-3.5.

"Changes in extremes can be linked to changes in the mean, variance, or
shape of probability distributions, or all of these (see, e.g., Figure 1-2).
Thus a change in the frequency of occurrence of hot days (i.e., days
above a certain threshold) can arise from a change in the mean daily
maximum temperature, and/or from a change in the variance and/or
shape of the frequency distribution of daily maximum temperatures. If
changes in the frequency of occurrence of hot days were mainly linked
to changes in the mean daily maximum temperature, and changes in the
shape and variability of the distribution of daily maximum temperatures
were of secondary importance, then it might be reasonable to use
projected changes in mean temperature to estimate how changes in
extreme temperatures might change in the future. If, however, changes in
the shape and variability of the frequency distribution of daily maximum
temperature were important, such naive extrapolation would be less
appropriate or possibly even misleading (e.g., Ballester et al, 2010). The
results of both empirical and model studies indicate that although in
several situations changes in extremes do scale closely with changes in
the mean (eg., Griffiths et al., 2005), there are sufficient exceptions from
this that changes in the variability and shape of probability distributions
of weather and climate variables need to be considered as well as
changes in means, if we are to project future changes in extremes (e.g.,
Hegerl et al., 2004; Schar et al., 2004; Caesar et al., 2006; Clark et al.,
2006; Della-Marta et al., 2007a; Kharin et al., 2007; Brown et al., 2008;
Ballester et al., 2010; Orlowsky and Seneviratne, 2011). This appears to be
especially the case for short-duration precipitation, and for temperatures
in mid- and high latitudes (but not all locations in these regions). In mid-
and high latitudes stronger increases (or decreases) in some extremes
are generally associated with feedbacks with soil moisture or snow
cover (Section 3.1.4). Note that the respective importance of changes in
mean versus changes in variability also depends on the choice of the
reference period used to define the extremes (Box 3-1).
"	Text
"publications and the public debate have focused, for example, on global
mean temperature targets (e.g., Allen et al., 2009; Meinshausen et al.,
2009), however, the exact implications of these mean global changes
(e.g., '2°C target’) for regional extremes have not been widely assessed
(eg., Clark et al., 2010). Orlowsky and Seneviratne (2011) investigated
the scaling between projected changes in the 10th and 90th percentile
of Tmax on annual and seasonal (June-July-August: JA, December-
January-February: DJF) time scales with globally averaged annual mean
changes in Tmax based on the whole CMIP3 ensemble (see Section 3.2.3
for discussion of the CMIP3 ensemble). The results highlight particularly
large projected changes in the 10th percentile Tmax in the northern
high-latitude regions in winter and the 90th percentile Tmax in
Southern Europe in summer with scaling factors of about 2 in both
cases (i.e, increases of about 4°C for a mean global increase of 2°C).
However, in some regions and seasons, the scaling can also be below 1
(e.g., changes in 10th percentile in JJA in the high latitudes). This is also
illustrated in Figure 3-5a, which compares analyses of changes in return
values of annual extremes of maximum daily temperatures for the overall
land and specific regions, and shows high region-to-region variability in
these changes. The changes in return values at the global scale (‘Globe
(Land only)’) for their part are almost identical to the changes in global
mean daily maximum temperature, suggesting that the scaling issues are
related to regional effects rather than overall differences in the changes
in the tails versus the means of the distributions of daily maximum
temperature. The situation is very different for precipitation (Figure 3-7a),
with clearly distinct behavior between changes in mean and extreme
precipitation at the global scale, highlighting the dependency of any
scaling on the variable being considered. The lack of consistent scaling
between regional and seasonal changes in extremes and changes in
means has also been highlighted in empirical studies (e.g., Caesar et al.,
2006). It should further be noted that not only do regional extremes not
necessarily scale with global mean changes, but also mean global
warming does not exclude the possibility of cooling in some regions and
seasons, both in the recent past and in the coming decades: it has for
instance been recently suggested that the decrease in sea ice caused by
the mean warming could induce, although not systematically, more
frequent cold winter extremes over northern continents (Petoukhov and
Semenov, 2010). Also parts of central North America and the eastern
United States present cooling trends in mean temperature and some
temperature extremes in the spring to summer season in recent decades
(Section 3.3.1). It should be noted that, independently of scaling issues
for the means and extremes of the same variable, some extremes can
be related to mean climate changes in other variables, such as links
between mean global changes in relative humidity and some regional
changes in heavy precipitation events (Sections 3.2.2.1 and 3.3.2).

"Issues with data availability are especially critical when examining
changes in extremes of given climate variables (Nicholls, 1995). Indeed,
the more rare the event, the more difficult it is to identify long-term
changes, simply because there are fewer cases to evaluate (Frei and
Schér, 2001; Klein Tank and Konnen, 2003). Identification of changes in
extremes is also dependent on the analysis technique employed (X.
Zhang et al., 2004; Trémel and Schénwiese, 2005). Another important
criterion constraining data availability for the analysis of extremes is the
respective time scale on which they occur (Section 3.1.2), since this
determines the required temporal resolution for their assessment (e.g.,
heavy hourly or daily precipitation versus multi-year drought). Longer
time resolution data (e.g., monthly, seasonal, and annual values) for

in climate regimes (e.g., from humid to transitional or transitional to dry).
Some of these regional changes will depend on how forcing changes may
alter the regional atmospheric circulation, especially in coastal regions
and regions with substantial orography. Hence for certain extremes such
as floods and droughts, regional projections might indicate larger
changes than is the case for projections of global averages (which
would average the regional signals exhibiting changes of opposite
signs). This also means that signals at the regional scale may be more
reliable (and meaningful) in some cases than assessments at the global
scale. On the other hand, temperature extremes projections, which are
consistent across most regions, are thus more reliable at the global
scale (‘virtually certain’) than at the regional scale (at most ‘very likely’).

"One aspect that we do not address in this chapter is the existence of
possible tipping points in the climate system (e.g., Meehl et al., 2007b;
Lenton et al., 2008; Scheffer et al., 2009), that is, the risks of abrupt,
possibly irreversible changes in the climate system. Abrupt climate
change is defined as follows in the Glossary: “The nonlinearity of the
climate system may lead to abrupt climate change, sometimes called
rapid climate change, abrupt events, or even surprises. The term abrupt
often refers to time scales faster than the typical time scale of the
responsible forcing. However, not all abrupt climate changes need be
externally forced. Some changes may be truly unexpected, resulting
from a strong, rapidly changing forcing of a nonlinear system.”
Thresholds associated with tipping points may be termed ‘critical
thresholds,’ or, in the case of the climate system, ‘climate thresholds’.
Scheffer et al. (2009) illustrate the possible equilibrium responses of a
system to forcing. In the case of a linear response, only a large forcing
can lead to a major state change in the system. However, in the presence
of a critical threshold even a small change in forcing can lead to a similar

"This report focuses on the most probable changes in extremes based on
current knowledge. However, the possible future occurrence of low-
probability, high-impact scenarios associated with the crossing of poorly
understood climate thresholds cannot be excluded, given the transient
and complex nature of the climate system. Such scenarios have important
implications for society as highlighted in Section 8.5.1. So, an assessment
that we have /ow confidence in projections of a specific extreme, or even
lack of consideration of given climate changes under the categories
covered in this chapter (e.g., shutdown of the meridional overturning
circulation), should not be interpreted as meaning that no change is
expected in this extreme or climate element (see also Section 3.1.5).
Feedbacks play an important role in either damping or enhancing
extremes in several climate variables (Section 3.1.4), and this can also
lead to ‘surprises,’ that is, changes in extremes greater (or less) than
might be expected with a gradual warming of the climate system.
Similarly, as discussed in 3.1.3, contrasting or multiple extremes can
occur but our understanding of these is insufficient to provide credible
comprehensive projections of risks associated with such combinations.

"major change in the system. For systems with critical bifurcations in the
equilibrium state function two alternative stable conditions may exist,
whereby an induced change may be irreversible. Such critical transitions
within the climate system represent typical low-probability, high-impact
scenarios, which were also noted in the AR4 (Meehl et al., 2007b).
Lenton et al. (2008) provided a recent review on potential tipping elements
within the climate system, that is, subsystems of the Earth system that
are at least subcontinental in scale and which may entail a tipping
point. Some of these would be especially relevant to certain extremes
[e.g., El Nifio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Indian summer monsoon,
and the Sahara/Sahel and West African monsoon for drought and heavy
precipitation, and the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets for sea
level extremes], or are induced by changes in extremes (e.g., Amazon
rainforest die-back induced by drought). For some of the identified
tipping elements, the existence of bistability has been suggested by
paleoclimate records, but is still debated in some cases (e.g., Brovkin et
al., 2009). There is often a lack of agreement between models regarding
these low-probability, high-impact scenarios, for instance, regarding a
possible increased drought and consequent die-back of the Amazon
rainforest (e.g., Friedlingstein et al, 2006; Poulter et al, 2010; see
Table 3-3 for dryness projections in this region), the risk of an actual
shutdown of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation (e.g., Rahmstorf et
al., 2005; Lenton et al, 2008), or the potential irreversibility of the
decrease in Arctic sea ice (Tietsche et al., 2011). For this reason,
confidence in these scenarios is assessed as low.

observations into a hybrid model-observational data set. However,
reanalyses can have homogeneity problems due to changes in the
amount and type of data being assimilated, such as the introduction of
satellite data in the late 1970s and other observing system changes
(Trenberth et al., 2001; Bengtsson et al., 2004). Recent reanalysis efforts

both of which can impact on whether a particular observation exceeds

"starting late in the 19th to early 20th century, and allow analysis of
meteorological drought (see Box 3-3) and unusually wet periods of the
order of a month or longer. To examine changes in extremes occurring on
short time scales, particularly of climate variables such as temperature
and precipitation (or wind), normally requires the use of high-temporal
resolution data, such as daily or sub-daily observations, which are
generally either not available, or available only since the middle of the
20th century and in many regions only from as recently as 1970. Even
where sufficient data are available, several problems can still limit their
analysis. First, although the situation is changing (especially for the
situation with respect to ‘extreme indices,’ Box 3-1), many countries still
do not freely distribute their higher temporal resolution data. Second,
there can be issues with the quality of measurements. A third important
issue is climate data homogeneity (see below). These and other issues
are discussed in detail in the AR4 (Trenberth et al., 2007). For instance,
the temperature and precipitation stations considered in the daily data
set used in Alexander et al. (2006) are not globally uniform. Although
observations for most parts of the globe are available, measurements
are lacking in Northern South America, Africa, and part of Australia. The
other data set commonly used for extremes analyses is from Caesar et al.
(2006; used, e.g., in Brown et al., 2008), which also has data gaps in
most of South America, Africa, Eastern Europe, Mexico, the Middle East,
India, and Southeast Asia. Also the study by Vose et al. (2005) has data
gaps in South America, Africa, and India. It should be further noted
that the regions with data coverage do not all have the same density of
stations (Alexander et al., 2006; Caesar et al., 2006). While some studies
are available on a country or regional basis for areas not covered in
global studies (see, e.g., Tables 3-2 and 3-3), lack of data in many parts
of the globe leads to limitations in our ability to assess observed
changes in climate extremes for many regions.

answer to the question of whether the climate, in general, has become more or less extreme. Both the terms ‘more extreme’ and ‘less

however, inadequate spatial coverage for these applications in many
regions of the world (e.g., Oki et al., 1999; Fekete et al., 2004; Koster et

without any overlap or calibration against existing methods to document
the impact of the changes on the climate record. Additionally, advances
in technology have enabled better and more complete observations. For
example, the introduction of aircraft reconnaissance in some basins in
the 1940s and satellite data in the 1960s had a profound effect on our
ability to accurately identify and measure tropical cyclones, particularly
those that never encountered land or a ship. While aircraft reconnaissance
programs have continued in the North Atlantic, they were terminated in
the Western Pacific in 1987. The introduction of geostationary satellite

One approach for evaluating whether the climate is becoming more extreme would be to determine whether there have been changes
in the typical range of variation of specific climate variables. For example, if there was evidence that temperature variations in a given
region had become significantly larger than in the past, then it would be reasonable to conclude that temperatures in that region had
become more extreme. More simply, temperature variations might be considered to be becoming more extreme if the difference
between the highest and the lowest temperature observed in a year is increasing. According to this approach, daily temperature over
the globe may have become less extreme because there have generally been greater increases in mean daily minimum temperatures
globally than in mean daily maximum temperatures, over the second half of the 20th century. On the other hand, one might conclude
that daily precipitation has become more extreme because observations suggest that the magnitude of the heaviest precipitation events
has increased in many parts of the world. Another approach would be to ask whether there have been significant changes in the
frequency with which climate variables cross fixed thresholds that have been associated with human or other impacts. For example, an
increase in the mean temperature usually results in an increase in hot extremes and a decrease in cold extremes. Such a shift in the
temperature distribution would not increase the ‘extremeness’ of day-to-day variations in temperature, but would be perceived as
resulting in a more extreme warm temperature climate, and a less extreme cold temperature climate. So the answer to the question
posed here would depend on the variable of interest, and on which specific measure of the extremeness of that variable is examined. As
well, to provide a complete answer to the above question, one would also have to collate not just trends in single variables, but also
indicators of change in complex extreme events resulting from a sequence of individual events, or the simultaneous occurrence of
different types of extremes. So it would be difficult to comprehensively describe the full suite of phenomena of concern, or to find a way
to synthesize all such indicators into a single extremeness metric that could be used to comprehensively assess whether the climate as a
whole has become more extreme from a physical perspective. And to make such a metric useful to more than a specific location, one
would have to combine the results at many locations, each with a different perspective on what is ‘extreme.’

is provided in Table 3-1. Climate variations and change are induced by
variability internal to the climate system, and changes in external
forcings, which include natural external forcings such as changes in solar
irradiance and volcanism, and anthropogenic forcings such as aerosol
and greenhouse gas emissions principally due to the burning of fossil
fuels, and land use and land cover changes. The mean state, extremes,
and variability are all related aspects of the climate, so external forcings
that affect the mean climate would in general result in changes in
extremes. For this reason, we provide in Section 3.2.2.1 a brief overview

"Brown et al., 2008). As a consequence, more complete and homogenous
information about changes is now available for at least some variables
and regions (Nicholls and Alexander, 2007; Peterson and Manton,
2008). For instance, the development of global databases of daily
temperature and precipitation covering up to 70% of the global land
area has allowed robust analyses of extremes (see Alexander et al.,
2006). In addition, analyses of temperature and precipitation extremes
using higher temporal resolution data, such as that available in the
Global Historical Climatology Network — Daily data set (Durre et al., 2008)
have also proven robust at both a global (Alexander et al., 2006) and
regional scale (Sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.2). Nonetheless, as highlighted
above, for many extremes, data remain sparse and problematic, resulting
in lower ability to establish changes, particularly on a global basis and
for specific regions.

"A third approach to solving this dilemma arises from the fact that extremes often have deleterious economic consequences. It may
therefore be possible to measure the integrated economic effects of the occurrence of different types of extremes into a common
instrument such as insurance payout to determine if there has been an increase or decrease in that instrument. This approach would
have the value that it clearly takes into account those extremes with economic consequences. But trends in such an instrument will be
dominated by changes in vulnerability and exposure and it will be difficult, if not impossible, to disentangle changes in the instrument
caused by non-climatic changes in vulnerability or exposure in order to leave a residual that reflects only changes in climate extremes.
For example, coastal development can increase the exposure of populations to hurricanes; therefore, an increase in damage in coastal
regions caused by hurricane landfalls will largely reflect changes in exposure and may not be indicative of increased hurricane activity.
Moreover, it may not always be possible to associate impacts such as the loss of human life or damage to an ecosystem due to climate
extremes to a measurable instrument.

"Three types of metrics have been considered to avoid these problems, and thereby allow an answer to this question. One approach is to
count the number of record-breaking events in a variable and to examine such a count for any trend. However, one would still face the
problem of what to do if, for instance, hot extremes are setting new records, while cold extremes are not occurring as frequently as in
the past. In such a case, counting the number of records might not indicate whether the climate was becoming more or less extreme,
rather just whether there was a shift in the mean climate. Also, the question of how to combine the numbers of record-breaking events
in various extremes (e.g., daily precipitation and hot temperatures) would need to be considered. Another approach is to combine
indicators of a selection of important extremes into a single index, such as the Climate Extremes Index (CEI), which measures the fraction
of the area of a region or country experiencing extremes in monthly mean surface temperature, daily precipitation, and drought. The CEI,
however, omits many important extremes such as tropical cyclones and tornadoes, and could, therefore, not be considered a complete
index of ‘extremeness.’ Nor does it take into account complex or multiple extremes, nor the varying thresholds that relate extremes to
impacts in various sectors.

smaller regions reduces the internal variability less than does averaging
over large regions. In addition, the small-scale details of external forcing,
and the responses simulated by models, are less credible than large-
scale features. For instance, temperature changes are poorly simulated
by models in some regions and seasons (Dean and Stott, 2009; van
Oldenborgh et al., 2009). Also the inclusion of additional forcing factors,
such as land use change and aerosols that can be more important at

"external forcings affecting extremes include net increases in temperature
induced by changes in radiation, enhanced moisture content of the
atmosphere, and increased land-sea contrast in temperatures, which can,
for example, affect circulation patterns and to some extent monsoons.
At regional and local scales, additional processes can modulate the
overall changes in extremes, including regional feedbacks, in particular
linked to land-atmosphere interactions with, for example, soil moisture
or snow (e.g., Section 3.1.4). This section briefly reviews the current
understanding of the causes (ie., in the sense of attribution to either
external forcing or internal climate variability) of large-scale (and some

"Regarding observed increases in global average annual mean surface
temperatures in the second half of the 20th century, we base our analysis
on the following AR4 assessment (Hegerl et al., 2007): Most of the
observed increase in global average temperatures is very likely due to
the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations.
Greenhouse gas forcing alone would /ikely have resulted in a greater
warming than observed if there had not been an offsetting cooling
effect from aerosol and other forcings. It is extremely unlikely (<5%)
that the global pattern of warming can be explained without external
forcing, and very unlikely that it is due to known natural external causes
alone. Anthropogenically forced warming over the second half of the
20th century has also been detected in ocean heat content and air
temperatures in all continents (Hegerl et al., 2007; Gillett et al., 2008b).
"	Text
"The increase in the atmospheric moisture content would be expected to
lead to an increase in extreme precipitation when other factors do not
change. Min et al. (2011) detected an anthropogenic influence in annual
maxima of daily precipitation over Northern Hemisphere land areas. The
influence of anthropogenic forcing has been detected in the latitudinal
pattern of land precipitation trends though the model-simulated
magnitude of changes is smaller than that observed (X. Zhang et al., 2007).
The smaller changes in model simulations may be due in part to averaging
precipitation trends from different model simulations, as spatial patterns
of trends simulated by different models are not exactly the same. The
influence of anthropogenic greenhouse gases and aerosols on changes
in precipitation over high-latitude land areas north of 55°N has also been
detected (Min et al., 2008). Detection is possible there, despite limited
data coverage, in part because the response to forcing is relatively strong,
and because internal variability in precipitation is low in this region.

"Hegerl et al. (2007) assessed literature that considered detection in
temperature trends at scales as small as approximately 500 km. Recent
work has provided more evidence of detection of an anthropogenic
influence at increasingly smaller spatial scales and for seasonal averages
(Stott et al., 2010). For instance, Min and Hense (2007) found that
estimates of response to anthropogenic forcing from the multi-model
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 3 (CMIP3) ensemble (see
Section 3.2.3.3) provided a better explanation for observed continental-
scale seasonal temperature changes than alternative explanations such
as natural external forcing or internal variability. In another study, an
anthropogenic signal was detected in 20th-century summer temperatures
in Northern Hemisphere subcontinental regions except central North
America, although the results were more uncertain when anthropogenic
and natural signals were considered together (Jones et al., 2008). An
anthropogenic signal has also been detected in multi-decadal trends
in a US climate extreme index (Burkholder and Karoly, 2007), in the
hydrological cycle of the western United States (Barnett et al., 2008), in
New Zealand temperatures (Dean and Stott, 2009), and in European
temperatures (Christidis et al., 201 1a).

"One of the significant advances since AR4 is emerging evidence of human
influence on global atmospheric moisture content and precipitation.
According to the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship, the saturation vapor
pressure increases approximately exponentially with temperature. It is
physically plausible that relative humidity would remain roughly constant
under climate change (e.g., Hegerl et al., 2007). This means that specific
humidity increases about 7% for a one degree increase in temperature
in the current climate. Indeed, observations indicate significant increases
between 1973 and 2003 in global surface specific humidity but not in
relative humidity (Willett et al., 2008), and at the largest spatial-temporal
scales moistening is close to the Clausius-Clapeyron scaling of the
saturated specific humidity (~7% K-1; Willett et al., 2010), though relative
humidity over low- and mid-latitude land areas decreased over a 10-year
period prior to 2008 possibly due to a slower temperature increase in
the oceans than over the land (Simmons et al., 2010). By comparing
observations with model simulations, changes in the global surface
specific humidity for 1973-2003 (Willett et al., 2007), and in lower
tropospheric moisture content over the 1988-2006 period (Santer et al.,
2007) can be attributed to anthropogenic influence.

"The discussion above relates to an individual, specific occurrence of an extreme event (e.g., a single heat wave). For the reasons outlined
above it remains very difficult to attribute any individual event to greenhouse gas-induced warming (even if physical reasoning or model
experiments suggest such an extreme may be more likely in a changed climate). On the other hand, a long-term trend in an extreme
(e.g., heat wave occurrences) is a different matter. It is certainly feasible to test whether such a trend is likely to have resulted from
anthropogenic influences on the climate, just as a global warming trend can be assessed to determine its likely cause.
"	Text
"A changing climate can be expected to lead to changes in climate and weather extremes. But it is challenging to associate a single
extreme event with a specific cause such as increasing greenhouse gases because a wide range of extreme events could occur even in
an unchanging climate, and because extreme events are usually caused by a combination of factors. Despite this, it may be possible to
make an attribution statement about a specific weather event by attributing the changed probability of its occurrence to a particular

cause. For example, it has been estimated that human influences have more than doubled the probability of a very hot European summer
like that of 2003.
"	Text
"Nevertheless, climate models can sometimes be used to identify if specific factors are changing the likelihood of the occurrence of
extreme events. In the case of the 2003 European heat wave, a model experiment indicated that human influences more than doubled
the likelihood of having a summer in Europe as hot as that of 2003, as discussed in the AR4. The value of such a probability-based
approach — “Does human influence change the likelihood of an event?” — is that it can be used to estimate the influence of external
factors, such as increases in greenhouse gases, on the frequency of specific types of events, such as heat waves or cold extremes. The
same likelihood-based approach has been used to examine anthropogenic greenhouse gas contribution to flood probability.
"	Text
"A second complicating issue is that extreme events usually result from a combination of factors, and this will make it difficult to attribute
an extreme to a single causal factor. The hot 2003 European summer was associated with a persistent high-pressure system (which led
to clear skies and thus more solar energy received at the surface) and too-dry soil (which meant that less solar energy was used for
evaporation, leaving more energy to heat the soil). Another example is that hurricane genesis requires weak vertical wind shear, as well
as very warm sea surface temperatures. Since some factors, but not others, may be affected by a specific cause such as increasing
greenhouse gas concentrations, it is difficult to separate the human influence on a single, specific extreme event from other factors
influencing the extreme.
"	Text
"Recent years have seen many extreme events including the extremely hot summer in parts of Europe in 2003 and 2010, and the intense
North Atlantic hurricane seasons of 2004 and 2005. Can the increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases be considered
the ‘cause’ of such extreme events? That is, could we say these events would not have occurred if CO, had remained at pre-industrial
concentrations? For instance, the monthly mean November temperature averaged across the state of New South Wales in Australia for
November 2009 is about 3.5 standard deviations warmer than the 1950-2008 mean, suggesting that the chance of such a temperature
occurring in the 1950-2008 climate (assuming a stationary climate) is quite low. Is this event, therefore, an indication of a changing
climate? In the CRUTEM3V global land surface temperature data set, about one in every 900 monthly mean temperatures observed
between 1900 and 1949 lies more than 3.5 standard deviations above the corresponding monthly mean temperature for 1950-2008.""
Since global temperature was lower in the first half of the 20th century, this clearly indicates that an extreme warm event as rare as the
November 2009 temperature in any specific location could have occurred in the past, even if its occurrence in recent times is more probable.

"Extreme events are rare, which means that there are also few data
available to make assessments regarding changes in their frequency or

extreme event occurs, a question that is often posed is whether such an
event is due to anthropogenic influence. Because it is very difficult to
rule out the occurrence of low-probability events in an unchanged

multiple factors, it is very difficult to attribute an individual event to
external forcing (Allen, 2003; Hegerl et al., 2007; Dole et al., 2011; see

they continue to develop, and their spatial resolution as well as their
complexity continues to improve, GCMs could become increasingly useful
for investigating smaller-scale features, including changes in extreme
weather events. However, when we wish to project climate and weather
extremes, not all atmospheric phenomena potentially of relevance can
be realistically or explicitly simulated. GCMs include a number of
approximations, known as parameterizations, of processes (e.g., relating
to clouds) that cannot be fully resolved in climate models. Furthermore,

However, the difference in statistical properties between mean values

see also Section 3.1.6). Post-processing of climate model simulations to
derive a quantity of interest that is not explicitly simulated by the models,
by applying empirical methods or physically based models to the outputs
from the climate models, may make it possible to directly compare
observed extremes with climate model results. For example, sea level
pressure simulated by multiple GCMs has been used to derive
geostrophic wind to represent atmospheric storminess and to derive
significant wave height on the oceans for the detection of external
influence on trends in atmospheric storminess and northern oceans
wave heights (X.L. Wang et al., 2009a). GCM-simulated precipitation
and temperature have also been downscaled as input to hydrological
and snowpack models to infer past and future changes in temperature,
timing of the peak flow, and snow water equivalent for the western
United States, and this enabled a detection and attribution analysis of
human-induced changes in these variables (Barnett et al., 2008).
"	Text
"If a single-step attribution of causes to effects on extremes or physical
impacts of extremes is not feasible, it might be feasible to conduct a
multiple-step attribution. The assessment would then need to be based
on evidence not directly derived from model simulations, that is, physical
understanding and expert judgment, or their combination. For instance,
in the northern high-latitude regions, spring temperature has increased,
and the timing of spring peak flows in snowmelt-fed rivers has shifted
toward earlier dates (Regonda et al., 2005; Knowles et al., 2006). A
change in streamflow may be attributable to external influence if
streamflow regime change can be attributed to a spring temperature
increase and if the spring temperature increase can be attributed to
external forcings (though these changes may not necessarily be linked to
changes in floods; Section 3.5.2). If the chain of processes is established
(eg., in this case additionally supported by the physical understanding
that snow melts earlier as spring temperature increases), the confidence
in the overall assessment would be similar to, or weaker than, the lower
confidence in the two steps in the assessment. In cases where the
underlying physical mechanisms are less certain, such as those linking
tropical cyclones and sea surface temperature (see Section 3.4.4), the
confidence in multi-step attribution can be severely undermined. A
necessary condition for multi-step attribution is to establish the chain of
mechanisms responsible for the specific extremes being considered.
Physically based process studies and sensitivity experiments that help
the physical understanding (e.g., Findell and Delworth, 2005;
Seneviratne et al., 2006a; Haarsma et al., 2009) can possibly play a role
in developing such multi-step attributions.

to regional-scale (up to 100 km) information from larger-scale models

downscaling and empirical/statistical downscaling (Christensen et al.,

models (RCMs), global models with variable spatial resolution, or high-
resolution global models. The empirical/statistical methods develop
statistical relationships that link the large-scale atmospheric variables
with local/regional climate variables. In all cases, the quality of the
downscaled product depends on the quality of the driving model.
Dynamical and statistical downscaling techniques are briefly introduced
hereafter. Specific limitations that need to be considered in the evaluation
of projections are also discussed in Section 3.2.3.2.

sub-domains, using either observed (reanalysis) or lower-resolution
GCM data to provide their boundary conditions. Using non-hydrostatic

diurnal cycle tends to be better resolved (e.g., Grell et al, 2000; Hay et al,
2006; Hohenegger et al., 2008; Kanada et al., 2010b). Less commonly
used approaches to dynamical downscaling involve the use of
stretched-grid (variable resolution) models and high-resolution ‘time-
slice’ models (e.g., Cubasch et al, 1995; Gibelin and Deque, 2003;
Coppola and Giorgi, 2005) with the latter including some simulations at
20 km globally (Kamiguchi et al., 2006; Kitoh et al., 2009; Kim et al.,
2010). The main advantage of dynamical downscaling is its potential for
capturing mesoscale nonlinear effects and providing information for
many climate variables at a relatively high spatial resolution, although
still not as high as some require. Dynamical downscaling cannot provide
information at the point (ie, weather station) scale (a scale at which

Statistical downscaling methods use relationships between large-scale
fields (predictors) and local-scale surface variables (predictands) that
have been derived from observed data, and apply these to equivalent
large-scale fields simulated by climate models (Christensen et al., 2007).
They may also include weather generators that provide the basis for a
number of recently developed user tools that can be used to assess
changes in extreme events (Kilsby et al., 2007; Burton et al., 2008; Qian et
al., 2008; Semenov, 2008). Statistical downscaling has been demonstrated
to have potential in a number of different regions including Europe
(e.g., Schmidli et al., 2007), Africa (e.g., Hewitson and Crane, 2006),
Australia (e.g., Timbal et al., 2008, 2009), South America (e.g., D'Onofrio
et al, 2010) and North America (e.g., Vrac et al, 2007; Dibike et al.,
2008). Statistical downscaling methods are able to access finer spatial
scales than dynamical methods and can be applied to parameters that
cannot be directly obtained from RCMs. Seasonal indices of extremes
can, for example, be simulated directly without having to first produce
daily time series (Haylock et al., 2006a), or distribution functions of
extremes can be simulated (Benestad, 2007). However, statistical
downscaling methods require observational data at the desired scale
(eg., the point or station scale) for a long enough period to allow the
model to be well trained and validated, and in some methods can lack
coherency among multiple climate variables and/or multiple sites. One
specific disadvantage of some, but not all, methods based on the
analog approach is that they cannot produce extreme events greater in
magnitude than have been observed before (Timbal et al., 2009).
Moreover, statistical downscaling does not allow for the possibility of
future process-based changes in relationships between predictors and
predictands (see Section 3.2.3.2). There have been few systematic
intercomparisons of dynamical and statistical downscaling approaches
focusing on extremes (Fowler et al., 2007b). Two examples focus on
extreme precipitation for the United Kingdom (Haylock et al., 2006a) and
the Alps (Schmidli et al, 2007), respectively. A few hybrid statistico-
dynamical downscaling methods also exist, including a two-step
approach used to downscale heavy precipitation events in southern
France (Beaulant et al., 2011). A conceptually similar cascading technique
has also been used to downscale tropical cyclones (Bender et al., 2010;
see Section 3.4.4).

sufficiently finely to simulate the high wind speeds and low pressure
centers of the most intense hurricanes (Knutson et al., 2010).
Realistically capturing details of such intense hurricanes, such as the
inner eyewall structure, would require models with 1-km horizontal
resolution, far beyond the capabilities of current GCMs and of most
current RCMs (and even global numerical weather prediction models).
Extremes may also be impacted by mesoscale circulations that GCMs
and even current RCMs cannot resolve, such as low-level jets and their
coupling with intense precipitation (Anderson et al., 2003; Menendez et
al., 2010). Another issue with small-scale processes is the lack of relevant
observations, such as is the case with soil moisture and vegetation
processes (Section 3.2.1) and relevant parameters (e.g., maps of soil types
and associated properties, see for instance Seneviratne et al., 2006b;

"As was noted in Section 3.2.3.1, most shortcomings in GCMs and
RCMs result from the fact that many important small-scale processes
(e.g., representations of clouds, convection, land surface processes) are
not represented explicitly (Randall et al., 2007). Some processes —
particularly those involving feedbacks (Section 3.1.4), and this is
especially the case for climate extremes and associated impacts — are
still poorly represented and/or understood (e.g., land-atmosphere
interactions, ocean-atmosphere interactions, stratospheric processes,
blocking dynamics) despite some improvements in the simulations of
others (see Box 3-2 and below). Therefore, limitations in computing
power and in the scientific understanding of some physical processes
currently restrict further global and regional climate model improvements.
In addition, uncertainty due to structural or parameter errors in GCMs
propagates directly from global model simulations as input to RCMs
and thus to downscaled information.

"Since many extreme events, such as those associated with precipitation,
occur at rather small temporal and spatial scales, where climate
simulation skill is currently limited and local conditions are highly
variable, projections of future changes cannot always be made with a
high level of confidence (Easterling et al., 2008). The credibility of
projections of changes in extremes varies with extreme type, season, and
geographical region (Box 3-2). Confidence and credibility in projected
changes in extremes increase when the physical mechanisms producing
extremes in models are considered reliable, such as increases in specific
humidity in the case of the projected increase in the proportion of summer
precipitation falling as intense events in central Europe (Kendon et al.,
2010). The ability of a model to capture the full distribution of variables
— not just the mean — together with long-term trends in extremes,
implies that some of the processes relevant to a future warming world
may be captured (Alexander and Arblaster, 2009; van Oldenborgh et al.,
2009). It should nonetheless be stressed that physical consistency of
simulations with observed behavior provides necessary but not sufficient
evidence for credible projections (Gutowski et al., 2008a).

"While downscaling provides more spatial detail (Section 3.2.3.1), the
added value of this step and the reliability of projections always needs
to be assessed (Benestad et al., 2007; Laprise et al., 2008). A potential
limitation and source of uncertainty in downscaling methods is that the
calibration of statistical models and the parameterization schemes used
in dynamical models are necessarily based on present (and past) climate
(as well as an understanding of physical processes). Thus they may not
be able to capture changes in extremes that are induced by future
mechanistic changes in regional (or global) climate, that is, if used
outside the range for which they were designed (Christensen et al.,
2007). Spatial inhomogeneity of both land use/land cover and aerosol
forcing adds to regional uncertainty. This means that the factors inducing
uncertainty in the projections of extremes in different regions may
differ considerably. Some specific issues inducing uncertainties in RCM
projections are the interactions with the driving GCM, especially in
terms of biases and climate change signal (e.g., de Elia et al, 2008;
Laprise et al., 2008; Kjellstrém and Lind, 2009; Déqué et al., 2011) and

approaches to downscaling are maturing and being more widely applied
but are still restricted in terms of geographical coverage (Maraun et al.,

and overall biases, it is necessary to bias-correct RCM data before input
to some impacts models (i.e., to bring the statistical properties of present-
day simulations in line with observations and to use this information to
correct projections). A number of bias correction methods, including
quantile mapping and gamma transform, have recently been developed
and exhibit promising skill for extremes of daily precipitation (Piani et

the combined use of observations and reanalyses, process understanding,

range of plausible climate responses to a given forcing (Meehl et al.,
2007b; Randall et al., 2007). Such ensembles can be generated either by
(i) collecting results from a range of models from different modelling
centers (multi-model ensembles), to include the impact of structural
model differences; (ii) by generating simulations with different initial
conditions (intra-model ensembles) to characterize the uncertainties
due to internal climate variability; or (iii) varying multiple internal model
parameters within plausible ranges (perturbed and stochastic physics
ensembles), with both (ii) and (iii) aiming to produce a more systematic

"Besides the uncertainty due to randomness itself, which is the canonical
statistical definition, it is important to distinguish between the uncertainty
due to insufficient agreement in the model projections, the uncertainty
due to insufficient evidence (insufficient observational data to constrain
the model projections or insufficient number of simulations from different
models or insufficient understanding of the physical processes), and the
uncertainty induced by insufficient literature, which refers to the lack of
published analyses of projections. For instance, models may agree on a
projected change, but if this change is controlled by processes that are
not well understood and validated in the present climate, then there is
an inherent uncertainty in the projections, no matter how good the
model agreement may be. Similarly, available model projections may
agree in a given change, but the number of available simulations may
restrain the reliability of the inferred agreement (e.g., because the
analyses need to be based on daily data that may not be available from
all modelling groups). All these issues have been taken into account in
assessing the confidence and likelihood of projected changes in
extremes for this report (see Section 3.1.5).

"Uncertainty analysis of the CMIP3 MME in AR4 focused essentially on the
seasonal mean and inter-model standard deviation values (Christensen et
al., 2007; Meeh| et al., 2007b; Randall et al., 2007). In addition, confidence
was assessed in the AR4 through simple quantification of the number of
models that show agreement in the sign of a specific climate change
(e.g., sign of the change in frequency of extremes) — assuming that the
greater the number of models in agreement, the greater the robustness.
However, the shortcoming of this definition of model agreement is that
it does not take account of possible common biases among models.
Indeed, the ensemble was strictly an ‘ensemble of opportunity,’ without
sampling protocol, and the possible dependence of different models on
one another (e.g., due to shared parameterizations) was not assessed
(Knutti et al., 2010a). Furthermore, this particular metric, which assesses
sign agreement only, can provide misleading conclusions in cases, for
example, where the projected changes are near zero. For this reason, in
our assessments of projected changes in extreme indices we consider
the model agreement as a necessary but not a sufficient condition for
likelihood statements [e.g., agreement of 66% of the models, as indicated
with shading in several of the figures (Figures 3-3, 3-4, 3-6, 3-8, and

"In summary, confidence in climate change projections depends on the (temporal and spatial) scale and variable being considered and
whether one considers extremes or mean quantities. Confidence is highest for temperature, especially at the global scale, and decreases
when other variables are considered, and when we focus on smaller spatial domains (Tables 3-1 and 3-3). Confidence in projections for

"The relative importance of various causes of uncertainties in projections is somewhat different for earlier compared with later future
periods. For some variables (mean temperature, temperature extremes), the choice of emission scenario becomes more critical than
model uncertainty for the second part of the 21st century (Tebaldi et al., 2006; Hawkins and Sutton, 2009, 2011) though this does not
apply for mean precipitation and some precipitation-related extremes (Tebaldi et al., 2006; Hawkins and Sutton, 2009, 2011), and has in
particular not been evaluated in detail for a wide range of extremes. Users need to be aware of such issues in deciding the range of
uncertainties that is appropriate to consider for their particular risk or impacts assessment

"This increased uncertainty at smaller scales results from larger internal variability at smaller scales or ‘noise’ (i.e., natural variability
unrelated to external forcings) and increased model uncertainty, both of which lead to lower model consistency at these scales (Hawkins
and Sutton, 2009). The latter factor is largely due to the role of unresolved processes (representations of clouds, convection, land surface
processes; see also Section 3.2.3). Hawkins and Sutton (2009) also point out regional variations in these aspects: in the tropics the
temperature signal expected from anthropogenic factors is large relative to the model uncertainty and the natural variability, compared
with higher latitudes. Figure 9.12 from AR4 (Hegerl et al., 2007) also shows that the models are more consistent in reproducing decadal
temperature variations in the tropics than at higher latitudes, even though the magnitudes of the temperature trends are larger at higher
latitudes.
"	Text
"Uncertainty in projections also depends on the variables, phenomena, or impacts considered (Sections 3.3. to 3.5.). There is more model
uncertainty for variables other than temperature, for instance precipitation (Raisdnen, 2007; Hawkins and Sutton, 2011; see also

Section 3.2.3). And the situation is more difficult again for extremes. For instance, climate models simulate observed changes in extreme
temperatures relatively well, but the frequency, distribution, and intensity of heavy precipitation is more poorly simulated (Randall et al.,
2007) as are observed changes in heavy precipitation (e.g., Alexander and Arblaster, 2009). Also, projections of changes in temperature
extremes tend to be more consistent across climate models (in terms of sign) than for (wet and dry) precipitation extremes (Tebaldi et
al., 2006; Orlowsky and Seneviratne, 2011; see also Figures 3-3 through 3-7 and 3-10) and significant inconsistencies are also found for
projections of agricultural (soil moisture) droughts (Wang, 2005; see also Box 3-3; Figure 3-10). For some other extremes, such as tropical
cyclones, differences in the regional-scale climate change projections between models can lead to marked differences in projected tropical
cyclone activity associated with anthropogenic climate change (Knutson et al., 2010), and thus decrease confidence in projections of
changes in that extreme.

"Comparisons of observed and simulated climate demonstrate good agreement for some climate variables such as mean temperature,
especially at large horizontal scales (e.g., Raisanen, 2007). For instance, Figure 9.12 of the AR4 (Hegerl et al., 2007) compares the ability
of 14 climate models to simulate the temporal variations of mean temperature through the 20th century. When the models included
both natural and anthropogenic forcings, they consistently reproduced the decadal variations in global mean temperature. Without the
anthropogenic influences the models consistently failed to reproduce the multi-decadal temperature variations. However, when the same
models’ abilities to simulate the temperature variations for smaller domains were assessed, although the mean temperature produced by
the ensemble generally tracked the observed temperature changes, the consistency among the models was poorer than was the case for
the global mean (Figure 9.12; Hegerl et al., 2007), partly because averaging over global scales smoothes internal variability or ‘noise’
more than averaging over smaller domains (see also Section 3.2.2.1). We can conclude that the smaller the spatial domain for which
simulations or projections are being prepared, the less confidence we should have in these projections (although in some limited cases
regional-scale projections can have higher reliability than larger-scale projections; see Section 3.1.6).

help place the recent instrumentally observed temperature extremes in
the context of a much longer period, but literature on this topic is very
sparse and most regional reconstructions are for Europe. For example

over central Europe back to 1500 using a variety of temperature proxy
records. They concluded that the summer 2003 heat wave and the July

the reconstruction method) of previous monthly temperature extremes
since 1500. Barriopedro et al. (2011) showed that the anomalously warm
summers of 2003 in western and central Europe and 2010 in eastern
Europe and Russia both broke the 500-year long seasonal temperature
record over 50% of Europe. The coldest periods within the last five
centuries occurred in the winter and spring of 1690. Another 500-year

observations (Camuffo et al, 2010). It suggests strong natural variability
in the basin, possibly exceeding the recent warming, although

"Both statistical and dynamical downscaling methods are affected by
the uncertainties that affect the global models, and a further level of
uncertainty associated with the downscaling step also needs to be
taken into consideration (see also Sections 3.2.3.1 and 3.2.3.2). The
increasing availability of coordinated RCM simulations for different
regions permits more systematic exploration of dynamical downscaling
uncertainty. Such simulations are available for Europe (e.g., Christensen
and Christensen, 2007; van der Linden and Mitchell, 2009) and a few
other regions such as North America (Mearns et al., 2009) and West
Africa (van der Linden and Mitchell, 2009; Hourdin et al., 2010). RCM
intercomparisons have also been undertaken for a number of regions
including Asia (Fu et al., 2005), South America (Menendez et al., 2010) and
the Arctic (Inoue et al., 2006). A new series of coordinated simulations
covering the globe is planned (Giorgi et al., 2009). Increasingly, RCM
output from coordinated simulations is made available at the daily time
scale, facilitating the analysis of some extreme events. Nevertheless, it
is important to point out that ensemble runs with RCMs currently
involve a limited number of driving GCMs, and hence only subsample
uncertainty space. Ensuring adequate sampling of RCM simulations (both
in terms of the number of considered RCMs and number of considered
driving GCMs) may be more important for extremes than for changes in
mean values (Frei et al., 2006; Fowler et al., 2007a). Internal variability,
for example, has been shown to make a significant contribution to
the spectrum of variability on at least multi-annual time scales and
potentially up to multi-decadal time scales (Kendon et al., 2008;
Hawkins and Sutton, 2009, 2011; Box 3-2).

"(eg., Chapter 4, Sections 3.5.6 and 3.5.7; see also Case Studies 9.2.1
and 9.2.10). Temperature extremes often occur on weather time scales
that require daily or higher time scale resolution data to accurately
assess possible changes (Section 3.2.1). It is important to distinguish
between daily mean, maximum (ie., daytime), and minimum (nighttime)
temperature, as well as between cold and warm extremes, due to their
differing impacts. Spell lengths (e.g., duration of heat waves) are
relevant for a number of impacts. Note that we do not consider
here changes in diurnal temperature range or frost days, which are not
typical ‘climate extremes’. There is an extensive body of literature
regarding the mechanisms of changes in temperature extremes (e.g.,
Christensen et al., 2007; Meehl et al., 2007b; Trenberth et al., 2007).
Heat waves are generally caused by quasi-stationary anticyclonic
circulation anomalies or atmospheric blocking (Xoplaki et al., 2003;
Meehl and Tebaldi, 2004; Cassou et al., 2005; Della-Marta et al., 2007b),
and/or land-atmosphere feedbacks (in transitional climate regions),
whereby the latter can act as an amplifying mechanism through reduction
in evaporative cooling (Section 3.1.4), but also induce enhanced
persistence due to soil moisture memory (Lorenz et al., 2010). Also snow
feedbacks (Section 3.1.4), and possibly changes in aerosols (Portmann et
al., 2009), are relevant for temperature extremes. Trends in temperature
extremes (either observed or projected) can sometimes be different for
the most extreme temperatures (e.g., annual maximum/minimum daily
maximum/minimum temperature) than for less extreme events [e.g.,
cold/warm days/nights; see, for instance, Brown et al. (2008) versus
Alexander et al. (2006)]. One reason for this is that ‘moderate extremes’
such as warm/cold days/nights are generally computed for each day
with respect to the long-term statistics for that day, thus, for example,
an increase in warm days for annual analyses does not necessarily imply
warming for the very warmest days of the year.

"Some recent analyses have led to revisions of previously reported
trends. For instance, Della-Marta et al. (2007a) found that mean summer

in Uruguay a reduction of cold nights, a positive but a statistically

warm days. Together with the previous results from Alexander et al.
(2006) for southern South America (see above) and further regional
studies (Table 3-2), this suggests a less consistent warming tendency in
South America compared to other continents. Another notable feature is
that studies for central and southeastern Europe display a marked
change point in trends in temperature extremes at the end of the
1970s/beginning of 1980s (Table 3-2), which for some extremes can
lead to very small and/or statistically not significant overall trends since
the 1960s (e.g., Bartholy and Pongracz, 2007).

more warm days and nights and fewer cold days and nights in
Alexander et al. (2006) were mostly central North America, the eastern
United States, southern Greenland (increase in cold days and decreases
in warm days), and the southern half of South America (decrease in
warm days; no data available for the northern half of the continent). In
central North America and the eastern United States this partial tendency
for a negative trend in extremes is also consistent with a reported mean
negative trend in temperatures, mostly in the spring to summer season
(also termed ‘warming hole’, e.g., Pan et al., 2004; Portmann et al.,
2009). Several explanations have been suggested for this behavior,
which seems partly associated with a change in the hydrological cycle,

"The AR4 (Trenberth et al, 2007, based on Alexander et al., 2006) reported
a Statistically significant increase in the numbers of warm nights and a
statistically significant reduction in the numbers of cold nights for 70 to
75% of the land regions with data (for the spatial coverage of the
underlying data set and the definition of warm/cold days and nights, see
Section 3.2.1 and Box 3-1, respectively). Changes in the numbers of
warm days and cold days also showed warming, but less marked
than for nights, with about 40 to 50% of the area with data showing
statistically significant changes consistent with warming (Alexander et
al., 2006). Less than 1% of the area with data showed statistically
significant trends in cold/warm days and nights that were consistent with
cooling (Alexander et al., 2006). Trenberth et al. (2007) also reported,
based on Vose et al. (2005), that from 1950 to 2004, the annual trends
in minimum and maximum land-surface air temperature averaged over
regions with data were 0.20°C per decade and 0.14°C per decade,
respectively, and that for 1979 to 2004, the corresponding linear trends
for the land areas with data were 0.29°C per decade for both maximum
and minimum temperature. Based on this evidence, the IPCC AR4 (SPM;
IPCC, 2007b) assessed that it was very likely that there had been trends
toward warmer and more frequent warm days and warm nights, and
warmer and less frequent cold days and cold nights in most land areas.

"There are fewer studies available investigating changes in characteristics
of cold spells and warm spells, or cold waves and heat waves, compared
with studies of the intensity or frequency of warm and cold days or
nights. Alexander et al. (2006) provided an analysis of trends in warm
spells [based on the Warm Spell Duration Index (WSDI); see Table 3-2
and Box 3-1] mostly in the mid- and high-latitudes of the Northern
Hemisphere. The analysis displays a tendency toward a higher length or
number of warm spells (increase in number of days belonging to warm
spells) in much of the region, with the exception of the southeastern
United States and eastern Canada. Regional studies on trends in warm
spells or heat waves are also listed in Table 3-2. Kunkel et al. (2008)
found that the United States has experienced a general decline in cold
waves over the 20th century, with a spike of more cold waves in the
1980s. Further, they report a strong increase in heat waves since 1960,
though the heat waves of the 1930s associated with extreme drought
conditions still dominate the 1895-2005 time series. Kuglitsch et al.
(2009) reported an increase in heat wave intensity, number, and length
in summer over the 1960-2006 time period in the eastern Mediterranean
region. Ding et al. (2010) reported increasing numbers of heat waves
over most of China for the 1961-2007 period. The record-breaking heat
wave over western and central Europe in the summer of 2003 is an
example of an exceptional recent extreme (Beniston, 2004; Schar and
Jendritzky, 2004). That summer (June to August) was the hottest since
comparable instrumental records began around 1780 and perhaps the
hottest since at least 1500 (Luterbacher et al., 2004). Other examples of
recent extreme heat waves include the 2006 heat wave in Europe
(Rebetez et al., 2008), the 2007 heat wave in southeastern Europe
(Founda and Giannakopoulos, 2009), the 2009 heat wave in southeastern
Australia (National Climate Centre, 2009), and the 2010 heat wave in
Russia (Barriopedro et al., 2011). Both the 2003 European heat wave
(Andersen et al., 2005; Ciais et al., 2005) and the 2009 southeastern
Australian heat wave were also associated with drought conditions,
which can strongly enhance temperature extremes during heat waves in
some regions (see also Section 3.1.4).

"In summary, regional and global analyses of temperature extremes on
land generally show recent changes consistent with a warming climate
at the global scale, in agreement with the previous assessment in AR4.
Only a few regions show changes in temperature extremes consistent
with cooling, most notably for some extremes in central North America,
the eastern United States, and also parts of South America. Based on the
available evidence we conclude that it is very likely that there has been
an overall decrease in the number of cold days and nights and very likely
that there has been an overall increase in the number of warm days and
nights in most regions, that is, for land areas with data (corresponding
to about 70 to 80% of all land areas; see Table 3-2). It is likely that this
statement applies at the continental scale in North America, Europe,

America and eastern United States). Asia also shows trends consistent
with warming in most of the continent, but which are assessed here to
be of medium confidence because of lack of literature for several regions
apart from the global study from Alexander et al. (2006). Most of Africa
is insufficiently well sampled to allow an overall likelihood statement to
be made at the continental scale, although most of the regions on this
continent for which data are available have exhibited warming in
temperature extremes (Table 3-2). In South America, both lack of data
and some inconsistencies in the reported trends imply /ow confidence in
the overall trends at the continental scale (Table 3-2). In many (but not
all) regions with sufficient data there is medium confidence that the
number of warm spells or heat waves has increased since the middle of
the 20th century (Table 3-2).

"Regarding projections of extreme temperatures, the AR4 (Meehl et al.,
2007b) noted that cold episodes were projected to decrease significantly
in a future warmer climate and considered it very likely that heat waves
would be more intense, more frequent, and last longer in a future warmer
climate. Post-AR4 studies of temperature extremes have utilized larger
model ensembles (Kharin et al., 2007; Sterl et al., 2008; Orlowsky and
Seneviratne, 2011) and generally confirm the conclusions of the AR4, while
also providing more specific assessments both in terms of the range of
considered extremes and the level of regional detail (see also Table 3-3).
"	Text
"Recent studies on attribution of changes in temperature extremes have
tended to reaffirm the conclusions reached in the AR4. Alexander and
Arblaster (2009) found that trends in warm nights over Australia could
only be reproduced by a coupled model that included anthropogenic
forcings. As part of the recent report of the US Climate Change Science
Program (CCSP, 2008), Gutowski et al. (2008a) concluded that most of
the observed changes in temperature extremes for the second half of
the 20th century over the United States can be attributed to human
activity. They compared observed changes in the number of frost days,
the length of growing season, the number of warm nights, and the heat
wave intensity with those simulated in a nine-member multi-model
ensemble simulation. The decrease in frost days, an increase in growing
season length, and an increase in heat wave intensity all show similar
changes over the United States in 20th-century experiments that
combine anthropogenic and natural forcings, though the relative
contributions of each are unclear.
"	Text
"Results from two global coupled climate models with separate
anthropogenic and natural forcing runs indicate that the observed
changes are simulated with anthropogenic forcings, but not with natural
forcings (even though there are some differences in the details of the
forcings). Zwiers et al. (2011) compared observed annual temperature
extremes including annual maximum daily maximum and minimum
temperatures, and annual minimum daily maximum and minimum
temperatures with those simulated responses to anthropogenic forcing or
anthropogenic and natural external forcings combined by multiple GCMs.
They fitted probability distributions (Box 3-1) to the observed extreme
temperatures with a time-evolving pattern of location parameters as
obtained from the model simulations, and found that both anthropogenic
influence and the combined influence of anthropogenic and natural
forcing can be detected in all four extreme temperature variables at the
global scale over the land, and also over many large land areas.
Globally, return periods for events that were expected to recur once
every 20 years in the 1960s are now estimated to exceed 30 years for
extreme annual minimum daily maximum temperature and 35 years for
extreme annual minimum daily minimum temperature, although these
estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty. Further, return peri-
ods were found to have decreased to less than 10 or 15 years for annual
maximum daily minimum and daily maximum temperatures respectively
(Figure 3-2).

"There are few global analyses of multi-model projections of temperature
extremes available in the literature. The study by Tebaldi et al. (2006),
which provided the basis for extreme projections given in the AR4
(Figures 10.18 and 10.19 in Meehl et al., 2007b), provided global analyses
of projected changes (A1B scenario) in several extremes indices based
on nine GCMs (note that not all modelling groups that saved daily data
also calculated the indices). For temperature extremes, analyses were
provided for heat wave lengths (using only one index, see discussion in
Box 3-1) and warm nights. Stippling was used where five out of nine
models displayed statistically significant changes of the same sign.
Orlowsky and Seneviratne (2011) recently updated the analysis from
Tebaldi et al. (2006) for the full ensemble of GCMs that contributed A2
scenarios to the CMIP3, using a larger number of extreme indices
{including several additional analyses of daily extremes (see Figures 3-3
and 3-4), and three heat wave indices instead of one; see also discussion
of heat wave indices in Box 3-1], using other thresholds for display and
stippling of the figures (no results displayed if less than 66% of the
models agree on the sign of change; stippling used only for 90% model
agreement), and providing seasonal analyses. This analysis confirms
that strong agreement (in terms of sign of change) exists between the
various GCM projections for temperature-related extremes, with
projected increases in warm day occurrences (Figure 3-3) and heat wave
length, and decreases in cold extremes (Figure 3-4). Temperature
extremes on land are projected to warm faster than global annual mean
temperature in many regions and seasons, implying large changes in
extremes in some places, even for a global warming of 2 or 3°C (with
scaling factors for the SRES A2 scenario ranging between 0.5 and 2 for
moderate seasonal extremes; Orlowsky and Seneviratne, 2011). Based
on the analyses of Tebaldi et al. (2006) and Orlowsky and Seneviratne
(2011), as well as physical considerations, we assess that increases in
the number of warm days and nights and decreases in the number of
cold days and nights (defined with respect to present regional climate,
ie., the 1961-1990 reference period, see Box 3-1) are virtually certain at
the global scale. Further, given the assessed changes in hot and cold
days and nights and available analyses of projected changes in heat
wave length in the two studies, we assess that it is very likely that the
length, frequency, and/or intensity of heat waves will increase over
most land areas.

"in annual extremes (20-year extreme values) based on 12 GCMs for

periods of this extreme event by the end of the 21st century. However,
as noted above, the limited number of relevant detection and attribution

temperature extremes, and our assessments take this into account by
reducing the level of certainty in the assessments from what would be
derived by uncritical acceptance of the projections in Figure 3-5. The
assessments are also weakened to reflect the possibility that some
important processes relevant to extremes may be missing or be poorly
represented in models, as well as the fact that the model projections
considered in this study did not correspond to the full CMIP3 ensemble.

Meehl et al. (2009c) examined changes in record daily high and low
temperatures in the United States and show that even with projected
strong warming resulting in many more record highs than lows, the
occasional record low is still set. For Australia, the CMIP3 ensemble
projected increases in warm nights (15-40% by the end of the 21st
century) and heat wave duration, together with a decrease in the number
of frost days (Alexander and Arblaster, 2009). Inland regions show
greater warming compared with coastal zones (Suppiah et al., 2007;
Alexander and Arblaster, 2009) and large increases in the number of
days above 35 or 40°C are indicated (Suppiah et al., 2007). For the
entire South American region, a study with a single RCM projected more
frequent warm nights and fewer cold nights (Marengo et al., 2009a).
Several studies of regional and global model projections of changes in
extremes are available for the European continent (see also Table 3-3).
Analyses of both global and regional model outputs show major
increases in warm temperature extremes across the Mediterranean
region including events such as hot days (Tmax >30°C) and tropical
nights (Tmin>20°C) (Giannakopoulos et al., 2009; Tolika et al., 2009).

"Comparison of RCM projections using the A1B forcing scenario, with
data for 2007 (the hottest summer in Greece in the instrumental record
with a record daily Tmax observed value of 44.8°C) indicates that the
distribution for 2007 is closer to the distribution for 2071-2100 than for
the 2021-2050 period, thus 2007 might be considered a ‘normal’ summer
of the future (Founda and Giannakopoulos, 2009; Tolika et al., 2009).
Beniston et al. (2007) concluded from an analysis of RCM output that
regions such as France and Hungary may experience as many days per
year above 30°C as currently experienced in Spain and Sicily. In this
RCM ensemble, France was the area with the largest projected warming
in the uppermost percentiles of daily summer temperatures although
the mean warming was greatest in the Mediterranean region (Fischer
and Schar, 2009). New results from an RCM ensemble project increases
in the amplitude, frequency, and duration of health-impacting heat waves,
especially in southern Europe (Fischer and Schar, 2010). Overall these
regional assessments are consistent with the global assessments provided
above. It should be noted, however, that the assessed uncertainty is larger
at the regional level than at the continental or global level (see Box 3-2).
Global-scale trends in a specific extreme may be either more reliable or
less reliable than regional-scale trends, depending on the geographical
uniformity of the trends in the specific extreme (Section 3.1.6).

"In summary, since 1950 it is very likely that there has been an
overall decrease in the number of cold days and nights and an
overall increase in the number of warm days and nights at the
global scale, that is, for land areas with sufficient data. It is likely
that such changes have also occurred at the continental scale in
North America, Europe, and Australia. There is medium confidence
in a warming trend in daily temperature extremes in much of Asia.
Confidence in historical trends in daily temperature extremes in
Africa and South America generally varies from low to medium
depending on the region. Globally, in many (but not all) regions
with sufficient data there is medium confidence that the length or
number of warm spells or heat waves has increased since the

"This section addresses changes in daily extreme or heavy precipitation
events. Reductions in mean (or total) precipitation that can lead to
drought (i.e., associated with lack of precipitation) are considered in
Section 3.5.1. Because climates are so diverse across different parts of
the world, it is difficult to provide a single definition of extreme or heavy
precipitation. In general, two different approaches have been used:
(1) relative thresholds such as percentiles (typically the 95th percentile)
and return values; and (2) absolute thresholds [e.g., 50.8 mm (2 inches)
day”! of rain in the United States, and 100 mm day""! of rain in China].
For more details on the respective drawbacks and advantages of these
two approaches, see Section 3.1 and Box 3-1. Note that we do not
distinguish between rain and snowfall (both considered as contributors
to overall extreme precipitation events) as they are not treated separately
in the literature, but do distinguish changes in hail from other precipitation
types. Increases in public awareness and changes in reporting practices
have led to inconsistencies in the record of severe thunderstorms and
hail that make it difficult to detect trends in the intensity or frequency
of these events (Kunkel et al., 2008). Furthermore, weather events such
as hail are not well captured by current monitoring systems and, in
some parts of the world, the monitoring network is very sparse (Section
3.2.1), resulting in considerable uncertainty in the estimates of extreme

"middle of the 20th century. It is /ikely that anthropogenic
influences have led to warming of extreme daily minimum and
maximum temperatures at the global scale. Models project
substantial warming in temperature extremes by the end of the
21st century. It is virtually certain that increases in the frequency
and magnitude of warm days and nights and decreases in the cold
days and nights will occur through the 21st century at the global
scale. This is mostly linked with mean changes in temperatures,
although changes in temperature variability can play an important
role in some regions. It is very likely that the length, frequency,
and/or intensity of warm spells or heat waves (defined with
respect to present regional climate) will increase over most land
areas. For the SRES A2 and A1B emission scenarios a 1-in-20 year
annual hottest day is likely to become a 1-in-2 year annual
extreme by the end of the 21st century in most regions, except in
the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere where it is likely
to become a 1-in-5 year annual extreme. In terms of absolute
values, 20-year extreme annual daily maximum temperature (i.e.,
return value) will likely increase by about 1 to 3°C by mid-21st
century and by about 2 to 5°C by the late 21st century, depending
on the region and emissions scenario (Figure 3-5). Moderate
temperature extremes on land are projected to warm faster than
global annual mean temperature in many regions and seasons.
Projected changes at subcontinental scales are less certain than
is the case for the global scale. Regional changes in temperature
extremes will differ from the mean global temperature change.
Mean global warming does not necessarily imply warming in all
regions and seasons.
"	Text
"Temperature extremes were the type of extremes projected to change
with most confidence in the AR4 (IPCC, 2007a). This is confirmed
regarding the sign of change with more recent analyses (Figures 3-3
and 3-4), although there is a large spread with respect to the magnitude
of changes both due to emission scenario and climate model uncertainty
(Figures 3-5a,b). If changes in temperature extremes scale with changes
in mean temperature (i.e., simple shifts of the probability distribution),
we infer that it is virtually certain that hot extremes will increase and
cold extremes will decrease over the 21st century with respect to the
1960-1990 climate. Changes in the tails of the temperature distributions
may not scale with changes in the mean in some regions (Section 3.1.6),
though in most such reported cases hot extremes tend to increase and
cold extremes decrease more than mean temperature, and thus the
above statement for extremes (virtually certain increase in hot extremes
and decrease in cold extremes) still applies. Central and eastern Europe
is a region where the evidence suggests that projected changes in
temperature extremes result from both changes in the mean as well as
from changes in the shape of the probability distributions (Schar et al.,
2004). The main mechanism for the widening of the distribution is
linked to the drying of the soil in this region (Sections 3.1.4 and 3.1.6).
Furthermore, remote surface heating may induce circulation changes
that modify the temperature distribution (Haarsma et al., 2009). Other
local, mesoscale, and regional feedback mechanisms, in particular with
land surface conditions (beside soil moisture, also with vegetation and
snow; Section 3.1.4) and aerosol concentrations (Ruckstuhl and Norris,
2009) may enhance the uncertainties in temperature projections. Some
of these processes occur at a small scale unresolved by the models
(Section 3.2.3). In addition, lack of observational data (e.g., for soil
moisture and snow cover; see Section 3.2.1) reduces the possibilities to
evaluate climate models (e.g., Roesch, 2006; Boe and Terray, 2008; Hall
et al, 2008; Brown and Mote, 2009). Because of these various processes
and associated uncertainties, mean global warming does not necessarily
imply warming in all regions and seasons (see also Section 3.1.6).
Regarding mesoscale processes, lack of information also affects
confidence in projections. One example is changes in heat waves in the
Mediterranean region that are suggested to have the largest impact in
coastal areas, due to the role of enhanced relative humidity in health
impacts (Diffenbaugh et al., 2007; Fischer and Schar, 2010). But it is not
clear how this pattern may or may not be moderated by sea breezes
(Diffenbaugh et al., 2007).

"Recent studies on past and current changes in precipitation extremes in
North America, some of which are included in the recent assessment of
the CCSP report (Kunkel et al., 2008), have reported an increasing trend
over the last half century. Based on station data from Canada, the
United States, and Mexico, Peterson et al. (2008a) reported that heavy
precipitation has been increasing over 1950-2004, as well as the average
amount of precipitation falling on days with precipitation. For the
contiguous United States, DeGaetano (2009) showed a 20% reduction
in the return period for extreme precipitation of different return levels
over 1950-2007; Gleason et al. (2008) reported an increasing trend in
the area experiencing a much above-normal proportion of heavy daily
precipitation from 1950 to 2006; and Pryor et al. (2009) provided evidence
of increases in the intensity of events above the 95th percentile during
the 20th century, with a larger magnitude of the increase at the end of the

"century. The largest trends toward increased annual total precipitation,
number of rainy days, and intense precipitation (e.g., fraction derived
from events in excess of the 90th percentile value) were focused on the
Great Plains/northwestern Midwest (Pryor et al., 2009). In the core of
the North American monsoon region in northwest Mexico, statistically
significant positive trends were found in daily precipitation intensity
and seasonal contribution of daily precipitation greater than its 95th
percentile in the mountain sites for the period 1961-1998. However, no
statistically significant changes were found in coastal stations (Cavazos
et al, 2008). Overall, the evidence indicates a /ikely increase in observed
heavy precipitation in many regions in North America, despite statistically
non-significant trends and some decreases in some subregions (Table 3-2).
This general increase in heavy precipitation accompanies a general
increase in total precipitation in most areas of the country.

"There is medium confidence in trends in heavy precipitation in Europe,
due to partly inconsistent signals across studies and regions, especially
in summer (Table 3-2). Winter extreme precipitation has increased in part
of the continent, in particular in central-western Europe and European
Russia (Zolina et al., 2009), but the trend in summer precipitation has
been weak or not spatially coherent (Moberg et al., 2006; Bartholy and
Pongracz, 2007; Maraun et al., 2008; Pavan et al., 2008; Zolina et al.,
2008; Costa and Soares, 2009; Kysely, 2009; Durao et al., 2010; Rodda
et al., 2010). Increasing trends in 90th, 95th, and 98th percentiles of daily
winter precipitation over 1901-2000 were found (Moberg et al., 2006),
which has been confirmed by more detailed country-based studies for
the United Kingdom (Maraun et al., 2008), Germany (Zolina et al.,
2008), and central and eastern Europe (Bartholy and Pongracz, 2007;
Kysely, 2009), while decreasing trends have been found in some regions
such as northern Italy (Pavan et al., 2008), Poland (Lupikasza, 2010),
and some Mediterranean coastal sites (Toreti et al., 2010). Uncertainties
are overall larger in southern Europe and the Mediterranean region,
where there is /ow confidence in the trends (Table 3-2). A recent study
(Zolina et al., 2010) has indicated that there has been an increase of
about 15 to 20% in the persistence of wet spells over most of Europe
over the last 60 years, which was not associated with an increase of the
total number of wet days.

"The AR4 (Trenberth et al., 2007) concluded that it was /ikely that there
had been increases in the number of heavy precipitation events (e.g.,
95th percentile) over the second half of the 20th century within many
land regions, even in those where there had been a reduction in total
precipitation amount, consistent with a warming climate and observed
significant increasing amounts of water vapor in the atmosphere.
Increases had also been reported for rarer precipitation events (1-in-50
year return period), but only a few regions had sufficient data to assess
such trends reliably. However, the AR4 (Trenberth et al., 2007) also stated
that “Many analyses indicate that the evolution of rainfall statistics
through the second half of the 20th century is dominated by variations
on the interannual to inter-decadal time scale and that trend estimates
are spatially incoherent (Manton et al., 2001; Peterson et al., 2002; Griffiths
et al. 2003; Herath and Ratnayake, 2004)”. Overall, as highlighted in
Alexander et al. (2006), the observed changes in precipitation extremes
were found at the time to be much less spatially coherent and statistically
significant compared to observed changes in temperature extremes:
although statistically significant trends toward stronger precipitation
extremes were generally found for a larger fraction of the land area
than trends toward weaker precipitation extremes, statistically significant
changes in precipitation indices for the overall land areas with data
were only found for the Simple Daily Intensity index, and not for other
considered indices such as Heavy Rainfall Days (Alexander et al., 2006).

forcing and extreme precipitation had not been established at the time
of the AR4. As a result, the AR4 only concluded that it was more likely
than not that anthropogenic influence had contributed to a global trend

the second half of the 20th century (Heger! et al., 2007).

"In southern Australia, there has been a likely decrease in heavy

the proportion of annual/seasonal rainfall stemming from heavy rain
days from 1911-2008 and 1957-2008 in northwest Australia (Gallant

Swan-Avon River basin in western Australia increased over 1950-2003
while extreme winter rainfall over the southwest of the basin decreased

from reanalyses or from radiosonde data and the estimates are associated
with high uncertainty. As a result, assessment of changes in hail frequency
is difficult. For severe thunderstorms in the region east of the Rocky
Mountains in the United States, Brooks and Dotzek (2008) found strong
variability but no clear trend in the past 50 years. Cao (2008) identified
a robust upward trend in hail frequency over Ontario, Canada. Kunz et

and negative trends were observed at subregional scales within these
regions. Heavy precipitation increased in Japan during 1901-2004 (Fujibe

In Peninsular Malaysia during 1971-2005 the intensity of extreme
precipitation increased and the frequency decreased, while the trend in
the proportion of extreme rainfall over total precipitation was not

"There is low to medium confidence in regional trends in heavy
precipitation in Africa due to partial lack of literature and data, and due
to lack of consistency in reported patterns in some regions (Table 3-2).
The AR4 (Trenberth et al, 2007) reported an increase in heavy
precipitation over southern Africa, but this appears to depend on the
region and precipitation index examined (Kruger, 2006; New et al.,
2006; Seleshi and Camberlin, 2006; Aguilar et al., 2009). Central Africa
exhibited a decrease in heavy precipitation over the last half century
(Aguilar et al., 2009); however, data coverage for large parts of the
region was poor. Precipitation from heavy events has decreased in
western central Africa, but with low spatial coherence (Aguilar et al.,
2009). Rainfall intensity averaged over southern and west Africa has
increased (New et al., 2006). There is a lack of literature on changes in
heavy precipitation in East Africa (Table 3-2). Camberlin et al. (2009)
analyzed changes in components of rainy seasons’ variability over the
time period 1958-1987 in this region, but did not specifically address
trends in heavy precipitation. There were decreasing trends in heavy
precipitation over parts of Ethiopia during the period 1965-2002
(Seleshi and Camberlin, 2006).

"New research since the AR4 provides more evidence of anthropogenic
influence on various aspects of the global hydrological cycle (Stott et al.,
2010; see also Section 3.2.2), which is directly relevant to extreme
precipitation changes. In particular, an anthropogenic influence on
atmospheric moisture content is detectable (Santer et al., 2007; Willett
et al., 2007; see also Section 3.2.2). Wang and Zhang (2008) show that
winter season maximum daily precipitation in North America appears to
be statistically significantly influenced by atmospheric moisture content,
with an increase in moisture corresponding to an increase in maximum
daily precipitation. This behavior has also been seen in model projections
of extreme winter precipitation under global warming (Gutowski et al.,
2008b). Climate model projections suggest that the thermodynamic
constraint based on the Clausius-Clapeyron relation is a good predictor
for extreme precipitation changes in a warmer world in regions where
the nature of the ambient flows change little (Pall et al, 2007). This
indicates that the observed increase in extreme precipitation in many
regions is consistent with the expected extreme precipitation response
to anthropogenic influences. However, the thermodynamic constraint
may not be a good predictor in regions with circulation changes, such as
mid- to higher latitudes (Meehl et al., 2005) and the tropics (Emori and
Brown, 2005), and in arid regions. Additionally, changes in precipitation
extremes with temperature also depend on changes in the moist-
adiabatic temperature lapse rate, in the upward velocity, and in the
temperature when precipitation extremes occur (O'Gorman and
Schneider, 2009a,b; Sugiyama et al., 2010). This may explain why there
have not been increases in precipitation extremes everywhere, although
a low signal-to-noise ratio may also play a role. However, even in

Atlantic jet stream. The present assessment based on evidence from new
studies and those used in the AR4 is that there is medium confidence
that anthropogenic influence has contributed to changes in extreme
precipitation at the global scale. However, this conclusion may be
dependent on the season and spatial scale. For example, there is now
about a 50% chance that an anthropogenic influence can be detected
in UK extreme precipitation in winter, but the likelihood of the detection
in other seasons is very small (Fowler and Wilby, 2010).

"regions where the Clausius-Clapeyron constraint is not closely followed,
it still appears to be a better predictor for future changes in extreme
precipitation than the change in mean precipitation in climate model
projections (Pall et al., 2007). An observational study seems also to support
this thermodynamic theory. Analysis of daily precipitation from the
Special Sensor Microwave Imager over the tropical oceans shows a
direct link between rainfall extremes and temperature: heavy rainfall
events increase during warm periods (EI Nifio) and decrease during cold
periods (Allan and Soden, 2008). However, the observed amplification
of rainfall extremes is larger than that predicted by climate models
(Allan and Soden, 2008), due possibly to widely varying changes in
upward velocities associated with precipitation extremes (O'Gorman
and Schneider, 2008). Evidence from measurements in the Netherlands
suggests that hourly precipitation extremes may in some cases increase
14% per degree of warming, which is twice as fast as what would be
expected from the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship alone (Lenderink
and Van Meijgaard, 2008), though this is still under debate (Haerter and
Berg, 2009; Lenderink and van Meijgaard, 2009). A comparison between
observed and multi-model simulated extreme precipitation using an
optimal detection method suggests that the human-induced increase in

"High spatial resolution is important for studies of extreme precipitation
because the physical processes responsible for extreme precipitation
require high spatial resolution to resolve them (e.g., Kim et al., 2010).
Post-AR4 studies have employed three approaches to obtain high spatial
resolution to project precipitation extremes: high-resolution GCMs,
dynamical downscaling using RCMs, and statistical downscaling (see
also Section 3.2.3.1). Based on the Meteorological Research Institute
and Japan Meteorological Agency 20-km horizontal grid GCM, heavy
precipitation was projected to increase substantially in south Asia, the
Amazon, and west Africa, with increased dry spell persistence projected
in South Africa, southern Australia, and the Amazon at the end of the
21st century (Kamiguchi et al., 2006). In the Asian monsoon region,
heavy precipitation was projected to increase, notably in Bangladesh

"By analyzing simulations with a single GCM, Khon et al. (2007) reported
a projected general increase in extreme precipitation for the different
regions in northern Eurasia especially for winter. Su et al. (2009) found
that for the Yangtze River Basin region in 2001-2050, the 50-year heavy
precipitation events become more frequent, with return periods falling
to below 25 years (relative to 1951-2000 behavior). For the Indian
region, the Hadley Centre coupled model HadCM3 projects increases in
the magnitude of the heaviest rainfall with a doubling of atmospheric
CO, concentration (Turner and Slingo, 2009). Simulations by 12 GCMs
projected an increase in heavy precipitation intensity and mean
precipitation rates in east Africa, more severe precipitation deficits in
the southwest of southern Africa, and enhanced precipitation further
north in Zambia, Malawi, and northern Mozambique (Shongwe et al.,
2009, 2011). Rocha et al. (2008) evaluated differences in the precipitation
regime over southeastern Africa simulated by two GCMs under
present (1961-1990) and future (2071-2100) conditions as a result of
anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing. They found that the intensity of
all episode categories of precipitation events is projected to increase
practically over the whole region, whereas the number of episodes is
projected to decrease in most of the region and for most episode
categories. Extreme precipitation is projected to increase over Australia in
2080-2099 relative to 1980-1999 in an analysis of the CMIP3 ensemble,
although there are inconsistencies between projections from different
models (Alexander and Arblaster, 2009).

"regions in which the total precipitation was projected to decrease.

Post-AR4 analyses of climate model simulations partly confirm this
assessment but also highlight fairly large uncertainties and model biases
in projections of changes in heavy precipitation in some regions
(Section 3.2.3 and Table 3-3). On the other hand, more GCM and RCM
ensembles have now been analyzed for some regions (Table 3-3; see
also, e.g., Kharin et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2010). At the time of the AR4,
Tebaldi et al. (2006) was the main global study available on projected
changes in precipitation extremes (e.g., Figure 10.18 of Meehl et al.,
2007b). Orlowsky and Seneviratne (2011) extended this analysis to a
larger number of GCMs from the CMIP3 ensemble and for seasonal in
addition to annual time frames (see also Section 3.3.1). Figure 3-6 provides
corresponding analyses of projected annual and seasonal changes of
the wet-day intensity, the fraction of days with precipitation above the
95% quantile of daily wet-day precipitation, and the fraction of days
with precipitation above 10 mm day""!. It should be noted that the
10 mm day”! threshold cannot be considered extreme in several regions,
but highlights differences in projections for absolute and relative
thresholds (see also discussion in Box 3-1 and beginning of this section).
Figure 3-6 indicates that regions with model agreement (at least 66%)
with respect to changes in heavy precipitation are mostly found in the
high latitudes and in the tropics, and in some mid-latitude regions of the
Northern Hemisphere in the boreal winter. Regions with at least 90%
model agreement are even more limited and confined to the high
latitudes. Overall, model agreement in projected changes is found to be
stronger in boreal winter (DJF) than summer (JJA) for most regions.
Kharin et al. (2007) analyzed changes in annual maxima of 24-hour
precipitation in the outputs of 14 CMIP3 models. Figure 3-7a displays
the projected percentage change in the annual maximum of the 24-hour
precipitation rate from the late 20th-century 20-year return values,
while Figure 3-7b displays the corresponding projected return periods
for late 20th-century 20-year return values of the annual maximum
24-hour precipitation rates in the mid-21st century (left) and in late 21st
century (right) under three different emission scenarios (SRES B1, A1B,
and A2). Between the late 20th and the late 21st century, the projected
responses of extreme precipitation to future emissions show increased
precipitation rates in most regions, and decreases in return periods in
most regions in the high latitudes and the tropics and in some regions
in the mid-latitudes consistent with projected changes in several indices
related to heavy precipitation (see Figure 3-6 and Tebaldi et al., 2006),
although there are increases in return periods or only small changes
projected in several regions. Except for these regions, the return period
for an event of annual maximum 24-hour precipitation with a 20-year
return period in the late 20th century is projected to be about 5 to 15
years by the end of the 21st century. The greatest projected reductions
in return period are in high latitudes and some tropical regions. The
stronger CO» emissions scenarios (A1B and A2) lead to greater projected
decreases in return period. In some regions with projected decreases in
total precipitation (Christensen et al., 2007) such as southern Africa,
west Asia, and the west coast of South America, heavy precipitation is

"Confidence is still Jow for hail projections particularly due to a lack of
hail-specific modelling studies, and a lack of agreement among the few
available studies. There is little information in the AR4 regarding projected
changes in hail events, and there has been little new literature since the
AR&. Leslie et al. (2008) used coupled climate model simulations under
the SRES A1B scenario to estimate future changes in hailstorms in the
Sydney Basin, Australia. Their future climate simulations show an
increase in the frequency and intensity of hailstorms out to 2050, and
they suggest that the increase will emerge from the natural background
variability within just a few decades. This result offers a different
conclusion from the modelling study of Niall and Walsh (2005), which
simulated Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) for southeastern
Australia in an environment containing double the pre-industrial
concentrations of equivalent CO). They found a statistically significant
projected decrease in CAPE values and concluded that “it is possible

"inter- and intra-model variability and related uncertainties in the pattern
and magnitude of the change are large, although they also show that
the projected trends tend to agree with those recently observed in the
area, which may strengthen their credibility. May (2008) reported an
unrealistically large projected precipitation change over the Baltic Sea
in summer in an RCM, apparently related to an unrealistic projection of
Baltic Sea warming in the driving GCM. Frei et al. (2006) found large
model differences in summer when RCM formulation contributes
significantly to scenario uncertainty. In exploring the ability of two
statistical downscaling models to reproduce the direction of the projected
changes in indices of precipitation extremes, Hundecha and Bardossy
(2008) concluded that the statistical downscaling models seem to be
more reliable during seasons when local climate is determined by large-
scale circulation than by local convective processes. ThemeBl et al.
(2011) merged linear and nonlinear empirical-statistical downscaling
techniques with bias correction methods, and demonstrated their
ability to drastically reduce RCM error characteristics. The extent to which
the natural variability of the climate affects our ability to project the
anthropogenically forced component of changes in daily precipitation
extremes was investigated by Kendon et al. (2008). They show that
annual to multidecadal natural variability across Europe may contribute to
substantial uncertainty. Also, Kiktev et al. (2009) performed an objective
comparison of climatologies and historical trends of temperature and
precipitation extremes using observations and 20th-century climate
simulations. They did not detect significant similarity between simulated
and actual patterns of the indices of precipitation extremes in most cases.
Moreover, Allan and Soden (2008) used satellite observations and model
simulations to examine the response of tropical precipitation events to
naturally driven changes in surface temperature and atmospheric
moisture content. The observed amplification of rainfall extremes was
larger than that predicted by models. The underestimation of rainfall
extremes by the models may be related to the coarse spatial resolution
used in the model simulations — the magnitude of changes in precipitation
extremes depends on spatial resolution (Kitoh et al., 2009) — suggesting
that projections of future changes in rainfall extremes in response to
anthropogenic global warming may be underestimated.

and in the Yangtze River basin due to the intensified convergence of
water vapor flux in summer. Using statistical downscaling, Wang and
Zhang (2008) investigated possible changes in North American extreme
precipitation probability during winter from 1949-1999 to 2050-2099.
Downscaled results suggested a strong increase in extreme precipitation
over the south and central United States but decreases over the
Canadian prairies. Projected European precipitation extremes in high-
resolution studies tend to increase in northern Europe (Frei et al., 2006;
Beniston et al., 2007; Schmidli et al 2007), especially during winter
(Haugen and Iversen, 2008; May, 2008), as also highlighted in Table 3-3.
Fowler and Ekstroém (2009) project increases in both short-duration
(1-day) and longer-duration (10-day) precipitation extremes across the
United Kingdom during winter, spring, and autumn. In summer, model
projections for the United Kingdom span the zero change line, although
there is low confidence due to poor model performance in this season.
Using daily statistics from various models, Boberg et al. (2009a,b)
projected a clear increase in the contribution to total precipitation from
more intense events together with a decrease in the number of days
with light precipitation. This pattern of change was found to be robust
for all European subregions. In double-nested model simulations with a
horizontal grid spacing of 10 km, Tomassini and Jacob (2009) projected
positive trends in extreme quantiles of heavy precipitation over
Germany, although they are relatively small except for the high-CO, A2
emission scenario. For the Upper Mississippi River Basin region during
October through March, the intensity of extreme precipitation is projected
to increase (Gutowski et al., 2008b). Simulations with a single RCM
project an increase in the intensity of extreme precipitation events over
most of southeastern South America and western Amazonia in 2071-2100,
whereas in northeast Brazil and eastern Amazonia smaller or no
changes are projected (Marengo et al., 2009a). Outputs from another
RCM indicate an increase in the magnitude of future extreme rainfall
events in the Westernport region of Australia, consistent with results
based on the CMIP3 ensemble (Alexander and Arblaster, 2009), and the
size of this increase is greater in 2070 than in 2030 (Abbs and Rafter,
2008). When both future land use changes and increasing greenhouse
gas concentrations are considered in the simulations, tropical and
northern Africa are projected to experience less extreme rainfall events
by 2025 during most seasons except for autumn (Paeth and Thamm,
2007). Simulations with high-resolution RCMs projected that the
frequency of extreme precipitation increases in the warm climate for
June through to September in Japan (Nakamura et al., 2008; Wakazuki
et al., 2008; Kitoh et al., 2009). An increase in 90th-percentile values of
daily precipitation on the Pacific side of the Japanese islands during July
in the future climate was projected with a 5-km mesh cloud-system-
resolving non-hydrostatic RCM (Kanada et al., 2010b).

"The AR4 did not specifically address changes in extreme wind although
it did report on wind changes in the context of other phenomena such as
tropical and extratropical cyclones and oceanic waves and concluded that
mid-latitude westerlies had increased in strength in both hemispheres
(Trenberth et al., 2007). Direct investigation of changes in wind
climatology has been hampered by the sparseness of long-term, high-
quality wind measurements from terrestrial anemometers arising from the
influence of changes in instrumentation, station location, and surrounding
land use (eg., Cherry, 1988; Pryor et al., 2007; Jakob, 2010; see also
Section 3.2.1). Nevertheless, a number of recent studies report trends in

"Extreme wind speeds pose a threat to human safety, maritime and
aviation activities, and the integrity of infrastructure. As well as extreme
wind speeds, other attributes of wind can cause extreme impacts. Trends
in average wind speed can influence potential evaporation and in turn
water availability and droughts (e.g., McVicar et al., 2008; see also
Section 3.5.1 and Box 3-3). Sustained mid-latitude winds can elevate
coastal sea levels (e.g., Mclnnes et al., 2009b), while longer-term
changes in prevailing wind direction can cause changes in wave climate
and coastline stability (Pirazzoli and Tomasin, 2003; see also Sections
3.5.4 and 3.5.5). Aeolian processes exert significant influence on the
formation and evolution of arid and semi-arid environments, being
strongly linked to soil and vegetation change (Okin et al., 2006). A rapid
shift in wind direction may reposition the leading edge of a forest fire

"Over paleoclimatic time scales, proxy data have been used to infer
circulation changes across the globe from the mid-Holocene (~6000 years
ago) to the beginning of the industrial revolution (Wanner et al., 2008).
Over this period, there is evidence for changes in circulation patterns
across the globe. The Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) moved
southward, leading to weaker monsoons across Asia (Haug et al., 2001).
The Walker circulation strengthened and Southern Ocean westerlies
moved northward and strengthened, affecting southern Australia, New
Zealand, and southern South America (Shulmeister et al., 2006; Wanner
et al., 2008), and an increase in ENSO variability and frequency occurred
(Rein et al., 2005; Wanner et al., 2008). There is also weaker evidence for
a change toward a lower Northern Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), implying
weaker westerly winds over the north Atlantic (Wanner et al., 2008).
While the changes in the Northern Hemisphere were attributed to
changes in orbital forcing, those in the Southern Hemisphere were more
complex, possibly reflecting the additional role on circulation of heat
transport in the ocean. Solar variability and volcanic eruptions may also
have contributed to decadal to multi-centennial fluctuations over this
time period (Wanner et al., 2008).

"(see Section 4.2.2.2; Mills, 2005) while the fire itself may generate a
local circulation response such as tornado genesis (e.g., Cunningham
and Reeder, 2009). Unlike other weather and climate elements such as
temperature and rainfall, extreme winds are often considered in the
context of the extreme phenomena with which they are associated such
as tropical and extratropical cyclones (see also Sections 3.4.4 and 3.4.5),
thunderstorm downbursts, and tornadoes. Although wind is often not
used to define the extreme event itself (Peterson et al., 2008b), wind
speed thresholds may be used to characterize the severity of the
phenomenon (e.g., the Saffir-Simpson scale for tropical cyclones).
Changes in wind extremes may arise from changes in the intensity or
location of their associated phenomena (e.g., a change in local convective
activity) or from other changes in the climate system such as the
movement of large-scale circulation patterns. Wind extremes may be
defined by a range of quantities such as high percentiles, maxima over
a particular time scale (e.g., daily to yearly), or storm-related highest
values. Wind gusts, which are a measure of the highest winds in a short
time interval (typically 3 seconds), may be evaluated in models using
gust parameterizations that are applied to the maximum daily near-
surface wind speed (e.g., Rockel and Woth, 2007).

"In summary, it is ikely that there have been statistically significant
increases in the number of heavy precipitation events (e.g., 95th
percentile) in more regions than there have been statistically
significant decreases, but there are strong regional and subregional
variations in the trends (i.e, both between and within regions
considered in this report; Figure 3-1 and Tables 3-2 and 3-3). In
particular, many regions present statistically non-significant or
negative trends, and, where seasonal changes have been
assessed, there are also variations between seasons (e.g., more
consistent trends in winter than in summer in Europe). The overall
most consistent trends toward heavier precipitation events are
found in North America (likely increase over the continent). There
is low confidence in observed trends in phenomena such as hail
because of historical data inhomogeneities and inadequacies in
monitoring systems. Based on evidence from new studies and those
used in the AR4, there is medium confidence that anthropogenic
influence has contributed to intensification of extreme precipitation
at the global scale. There is almost no literature on the attribution
of changes in hail extremes, thus no assessment can be provided
for these at this point in time. Projected changes from both global
and regional studies indicate that it is likely that the frequency
of heavy precipitation or proportion of total rainfall from heavy
falls will increase in the 21st century over many areas on the
globe, especially in the high latitudes and tropical regions, and
northern mid-latitudes in winter. Heavy precipitation is projected
to increase in some (but not all) regions with projected decreases
of total precipitation (medium confidence). For a range of emission
scenarios (A2, A1B, and B1), projections indicate that it is likely that
a 1-in-20 year annual maximum 24-hour precipitation rate will
become a 1-in-5 to -15 year event by the end of 21st century in many
regions. Nevertheless, increases or statistically non-significant

"Trends in extreme winds have also been inferred from trends in particular
phenomena. With regards to tropical cyclones (Section 3.4.4.), no
statistically significant trends have been detected in the overall global
annual number although a trend has been reported in the intensity of
the strongest storms since 1980 [but there is /ow confidence that any
observed long-term (i.e., 40 years or more) increases in tropical cyclone
activity are robust, after accounting for past changes in observing
capabilities; see Section 3.4.4]. In the mid-latitudes, studies have used
proxies for wind such as pressure tendencies or geostrophic winds
calculated from triangles of pressure (geo-winds) over Europe (e.g.,
Barring and von Storch, 2004; Matulla et al., 2008; Allan et al., 2009;

"Alexander and Power, 2009; Alexander et al., 2011). For Europe, these
studies suggest that storm activity was higher around 1900 and in the
1990s and lower in the 1960s and 1970s, although X.L. Wang et al.
(2009b) note that seasonal trends behave differently than annual trends.
In general, long-term trends differ between the different available
studies as well as studies that focus on the period for which reanalysis
data exist (e.g., Raible, 2007; Leckebusch et al., 2008; Della-Marta et al.,
2009; Nissen et al., 2010), and strong inter-decadal variability is also
often reported (e.g., Allan et al., 2009; X.L. Wang et al., 2009b; Nissen et
al., 2010). Over southeast Australia, a decline in storm activity since
around 1885 has been reported (Alexander and Power, 2009; Alexander et
al., 2011). See Section 3.4.5 for more discussion of extratropical cyclones.
Regarding other phenomena associated with extreme winds, such as
thunderstorms, tornadoes, and mesoscale convective complexes, studies
are too few in number to assess the effect of their changes on extreme
winds. As well, historical data inhomogeneities mean that there is ow
confidence in any observed trends in these small-scale phenomena.

"The AR4 reported for the mid-latitudes that trends in the Northern and
Southern Annular Modes, which correspond to sea level pressure reductions
over the poles, are /ikely related in part to human activity, and this in
turn has affected storm tracks and wind patterns in both hemispheres
(Hegerl et al., 2007). The relationship between mean and severe winds
and natural modes of variability has been investigated in several post-
AR&4 studies. On the Canadian west coast, Abeysirigunawardena et al.
(2009) found that higher extreme winds tend to occur during the negative
(ie., cold) ENSO phase. The generally increasing trend in mean wind
speeds over recent decades in Antarctica is consistent with the change
in the nature of the Southern Annular Mode toward its high index state
(Turner et al., 2005). Donat et al. (2010b) concluded that 80% of storm
days in central Europe are connected with westerly flows that occur
primarily during the positive phase of the NAO. Declining trends in wind
over China have mainly been linked to circulation changes due to a
weaker land-sea thermal contrast (Xu et al., 2006; Jiang et al., 2010a;
Guo et al., 2011). Vautard et al. (2010) attribute the slowdown in mid to
high percentiles of surface winds over most of the continental northern
mid-latitudes to changes in atmospheric circulation (10-50%) and an
increase in surface roughness due to biomass increases (25-60%),
which are supported by RCM simulations. X.L. Wang et al. (2009a)
formally detected a link between external forcing and positive trends in
the high northern latitudes and negative trends in the northern mid-
latitudes using a proxy for wind (geostrophic wind energy) in the boreal
winter. Trends in mean and annual maximum winds in the central
Mediterranean region were found to be positively correlated with
temperature but not with the NAO index (Pirazzoli and Tomasin, 2003).
Nissen et al. (2010) used cyclone tracking to identify associated strong
winds in reanalysis data from 1957 to 2002 and found a positive trend
in the central Mediterranean region and southern Europe and a negative
trend over the western Mediterranean region.

"Over North America, a declining trend in 50th and 90th percentile wind

over western and most of southern Canada (Wan et al., 2010). An

1955-2001 by Lynch et al. (2004) and over the central Canadian Arctic

Over China, negative trends have been reported in 10-m monthly mean

10 and 2 times per year) in 10-m anemometer data over 1962-2002.
Pirazolli and Tomasin (2003) reported a generally declining trend in
both annual mean and annual maximum winds from 1951 to the mid-
1970s and an increasing trend since then, from observations in the
central Mediterranean region. Similar to the mostly declining trends
found in Northern Hemisphere studies of surface wind observations,
Vautard et al. (2010) also found mostly declining trends in surface wind
observations across the continental northern mid-latitudes and a
stronger decline in extreme winds compared to mean winds in surface

(significant over 57% of the country) over 1975-2006 and positive trends
over about 12% of the mainland interior and southern and eastern
coastal regions including Tasmania. In Antarctica, increasing trends in
mean wind speeds have been reported over the second half of the 20th
century (Turner et al., 2005). With the exception of the robust declines in
wind reported over China, studies in most areas are too few in number
to draw robust conclusions on wind speed change and even fewer
studies have addressed extreme wind change. Some studies report
opposite trends between anemometer winds and reanalysis data sets in
some areas (Smits et al., 2005; McVicar et al., 2008; Vautard et al., 2010);
however, comparisons of surface anemometer data at 10 m or lower
with reanalysis-derived 10-m data that do not resolve complex surface
features is problematic.

South Pacific, and the Southern Ocean. Mean wind speed declines occur
along the equator reflecting a slowdown in the Walker circulation

heavy precipitation derived from tropical cyclones. Arriaga-Ramirez and
Cavazos (2010) found that total and extreme rainfall in the monsoon
region of western Mexico and the US southwest presented a statistically
significant increase during 1961-1998, mainly in winter. Groisman and

"A variety of factors, natural and anthropogenic, have been suggested as
possible causes of variations in monsoons. Changes in regional monsoons
are strongly influenced by the changes in the states of dominant patterns
of climate variability such as ENSO, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO),
the Northern Annular Mode (NAM), the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation
(AMO), and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) (see also Sections 3.4.2
and 3.4.3). Additionally, model-based evidence has suggested that land
surface processes and land use changes could in some instances
significantly impact regional monsoons. Tropical land cover change in
Africa and southeast Asia appears to have weaker local climatic impacts
than in Amazonia (Voldoire and Royer, 2004; Mabuchi et al., 2005a,b).
Grimm et al. (2007) and Collini et al. (2008) explored possible feedbacks
between soil moisture and precipitation during the early stages of the
monsoon in South America, when the surface is not sufficiently wet, and
soil moisture anomalies may thus also modulate the development of
precipitation. However, the influence of historical land use on the
monsoon is difficult to quantify, due both to the poor documentation of
land use and difficulties in simulating the monsoon at fine scales. The
impact of aerosols (black carbon and sulfate) on changes in rainfall
variability and amounts in monsoon regions has been discussed by
Meehl et al. (2008), Lau et al. (2006), and Silva Dias et al. (2002). These
studies suggest that there are still large uncertainties and a strong
model dependency in the representation of the relevant land surface
processes and the role of aerosol direct forcing, and resulting interactions

these tropical circulations by the late 21st century compared to the late

in precipitation associated with monsoons. For instance, the monsoonal
precipitation in Mexico and Central America is projected to decrease in
association with increasing precipitation over the eastern equatorial
Pacific through changes in the Walker circulation and local Hadley
circulation (e.g., Lu et al., 2007). Furthermore, observations and models

the Asian monsoon (along with an increase in interannual season-

"Climate change scenarios for the 21st century show a weakening of the

poleward the baroclinic instability zone and hence the outer boundary

predict a slowdown of the tropical overturning circulation under global

the period 1960-2100 a weak tendency for an increase in dry spells. The
projections show an increase in the frequency of rainfall extremes in
southeastern South America by the end of the 21st century, possibly due
to an intensification of the moisture transport from Amazonia by a more

"There are many deficiencies in model representation of the monsoons

ability to project future changes. Some of the uncertainty in global and
regional climate change projections in the monsoon regions results from
the limits in the model representation of resolved processes (e.g., moisture
advection), the parameterizations of sub-grid-scale processes (e.g.,
clouds, precipitation), and model simulations of feedback mechanisms
at the global and regional scale (e.g., changes in land use/cover; see
also Section 3.1.4). Kharin et al. (2007) made an intercomparison of
precipitation extremes in the tropical region in all AR4 models with
observed extremes expressed as 20-year return values. They found very
large disagreement in the tropics suggesting that some physical
processes associated with extreme precipitation are not well represented
by the models due to model resolution and physics. Shukla (2007) noted
that current climate models cannot even adequately predict the mean
intensity and the seasonal variations of the Asian summer monsoon. This
reduces confidence in the projected changes in extreme precipitation
over the monsoon regions. Many of the important climatic effects of the
Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO, a natural mode of the climate system
operating on time scales of about a month), including its impacts on
rainfall variability in the monsoons, are still poorly simulated by

term changes in the behavior of the phenomenon might occur even
without forcing from radiative changes. Vecchi and Wittenberg (2010)
concluded that the “tropical Pacific could generate variations in ENSO
frequency and intensity on its own (via chaotic behavior), respond to
external radiative forcings (e.g., changes in greenhouse gases, volcanic

few studies, there are many issues with model representation of

"Most of the models reproduce the monsoon rain belt, extending from
southeast to northwest, and its gradual northward shift in early summer,
but overestimate the precipitation over the core monsoon region
throughout the seasonal cycle and fail to reproduce the monsoon
retreat in the fall. The AR4 assessed that models fail in representing the
main features of the west African monsoon although most of them do
have a monsoonal climate albeit with some distortion (Christensen et
al., 2007). Other major sources of uncertainty in projections of monsoon
changes are the responses and feedbacks of the climate system to
emissions as represented in climate models. These uncertainties are
particularly related to the representation of the conversion of emissions
into concentrations of radiatively active species (i.e., via atmospheric
chemistry and carbon cycle models) and especially those derived from
aerosol products of biomass burning, which can affect the onset of the
rainy season (Silva Dias et al., 2002). The subsequent response of the
physical climate system complicates the nature of future projections of
monsoon precipitation. Moreover, the long-term variations of model
skill in simulating monsoons and their variations represent an additional
source of uncertainty for the monsoon regions, and indicate that the
regional reliability of long climate model runs may depend on the time
slice for which the output of the model is analyzed.

"Oscillation’ refers to a tendency for above-average surface atmospheric
pressures in the Indian Ocean to be associated with below-average
pressures in the Pacific, and vice versa. This oscillation is associated
with variations in SSTs in the east equatorial Pacific. The oceanic and
atmospheric variations are collectively referred to as ENSO. An El Nifio
episode is one phase of the ENSO phenomenon and is associated with
abnormally warm central and east equatorial Pacific Ocean surface
temperatures, while the opposite phase, a La Nifia episode, is associated
with abnormally cool ocean temperatures in this region. Both phases
are associated with a characteristic spatial pattern of droughts and
floods. An El Nifio episode is usually accompanied by drought in
southeastern Asia, India, Australia, southeastern Africa, Amazonia, and
northeast Brazil, with fewer than normal tropical cyclones around
Australia and in the North Atlantic. Wetter than normal conditions
during El Nifio episodes are observed along the west coast of tropical
South America, subtropical latitudes of western North America, and
southeastern America. In a La Nifia episode the climate anomalies are
usually the opposite of those in an El Nifio. Pacific islands are strongly
affected by ENSO variations. Recent research (e.g., Kenyon and Hegerl,
2008; Ropelewski and Bell, 2008; Schubert et al., 2008a; Alexander et al.,
2009; Grimm and Tedeschi, 2009; Zhang et al., 2010) has demonstrated
that different phases of ENSO (EI Nifio or La Nifia episodes) also are
associated with different frequencies of occurrence of short-term weather
extremes such as heavy rainfall events and extreme temperatures. The
relationship between ENSO and interannual variations in tropical cyclone
activity is well known (eg., Kuleshov et al, 2008). The simultaneous

"Global warming is projected to lead to a mean reduction in the zonal
mean wind across the equatorial Pacific (Vecchi and Soden, 2007b).
However, this change should not be described as an ‘El Nifio-like’ average
change even though during an El Nifio episode these winds also weaken,
because there is only limited correspondence between these changes in
the mean state of the equatorial Pacific and an El Nifio episode. The
AR4 determined that all models exhibited continued ENSO interannual
variability in projections through the 21st century, but the projected
behavior of the phenomenon differed between models, and it was
concluded that “there is no consistent indication at this time of
discernible changes in projected ENSO amplitude or frequency in the
21st century” (Meehl et al., 2007b). Models project a wide variety of
changes in ENSO variability and the frequency of El Nifio episodes as a
consequence of increased greenhouse gas concentrations, with a range
between a 30% reduction to a 30% increase in variability (van Oldenborgh
et al., 2005). One model study even found that although ENSO activity
increased when atmospheric CO, concentrations were doubled or
quadrupled, a considerable decrease in activity occurred when CO, was
increased by a factor of 16 times, much greater than is possible through
the 21st century (Cherchi et al, 2008), suggesting a wide variety of
possible ENSO changes as a result of CO» changes. The remote impacts,
on rainfall for instance, of ENSO may change as COp increases, even if
the equatorial Pacific aspect of ENSO does not change substantially. For
instance, regions in which rainfall increases in the future tend to show
increases in interannual rainfall variability (Boer, 2009), without any
strong change in the interannual variability of tropical SSTs. Also, since
some long-term projected changes in response to increased greenhouse
gases may resemble the climate response to an El Nifio event, this may
enhance or mask the response to El Nifio events in the future (Lau et al.,
2008b; Miiller and Roeckner, 2008).

"The AR4 noted that the nature of ENSO has varied substantially over the
period of instrumental data, with strong events from the late 19th
century through the first quarter of the 20th century and again after
1950. An apparent climate shift around 1976-1977 was associated with
a shift to generally above-normal SSTs in the central and eastern Pacific
and a tendency toward more prolonged and stronger El Nifio episodes
(Trenberth et al., 2007). Ocean temperatures in the central equatorial
Pacific (the so-called NINO3 index) suggest a trend toward more frequent
or stronger El Nifio episodes over the past 50 to 100 years (Vecchi and
Wittenberg, 2010). Vecchi et al. (2006) reported a weakening of the
equatorial Pacific pressure gradient since the 1960s, with a sharp drop
in the 1970s. Power and Smith (2007) proposed that the apparent
dominance of El Nifio during the last few decades was due in part to a
change in the background state of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI,
the standardized difference in surface atmospheric pressure between
Tahiti and Darwin), rather than a change in variability or a shift to more
frequent El Nifio events alone. Nicholls (2008) examined the behavior of
the SOI and another index, the NINO3.4 index of central equatorial
Pacific SSTs, but found no evidence of trends in the variability or the
persistence of the indices [although Yu and Kao (2007) reported decadal
variations in the persistence barrier, the tendency for weaker persistence
across the Northern Hemisphere spring], nor in their seasonal patterns.
There was a trend toward what might be considered more ‘El Nifio-like’
behavior in the SOI (and more weakly in NINO3.4), but only through the
period March to September and not in November to February, the season
when EI Nifio and La Nifia events typically peak. The trend in the SOI
reflected only a trend in Darwin pressures, with no trend in Tahiti
pressures. Apart from this trend, the temporal/seasonal nature of ENSO has
been remarkably consistent through a period of strong global warming.
There is evidence, however, of a tendency for recent El Nifio episodes to
be centered more in the central equatorial Pacific than in the east Pacific
(Yeh et al., 2009), and for these central Pacific episodes to be increasing
in intensity (lee and McPhaden, 2010). In turn, these changes may
explain changes that have been noted in the remote influences of the
phenomenon on the climate over Australia and in the mid-latitudes
(Wang and Hendon, 2007; Weng et al., 2009). For instance, Taschetto et
al. (2009) demonstrated that episodes with the warming centered in the
central Pacific exhibit different patterns of Australian rainfall variations
relative to the east Pacific-centered El Nifio events.

of increased greenhouse gas concentrations are not consistent,
and so there is Jow confidence in projections of changes in the

frequency of central equatorial Pacific events, which typically

"There was no consistency in projections of changes in ENSO variability
or frequency at the time of the AR4 (Meehl et al., 2007b) and this
situation has not changed as a result of post-AR4 studies. The evidence
is that the nature of ENSO has varied in the past apparently sometimes
in response to changes in radiative forcing but also possibly due to
internal climatic variability. Since radiative forcing will continue to
change in the future, we can confidently expect changes in ENSO and
its impacts as well, although both El Nifio and La Nifia episodes will
continue to occur (e.g., Vecchi and Wittenberg, 2010). Our current limited
understanding, however, means that it is not possible at this time to
confidently predict whether ENSO activity will be enhanced or damped
due to anthropogenic climate change, or even if the frequency of El Nifio
or La Nifia episodes will change (Collins et al., 2010).

from systematic biases in the depiction of ENSO behavior through the

Leloup et al. (2008) for instance, demonstrate that coupled climate
models show wide differences in the ability to reproduce the spatial
characteristics of SST variations associated with ENSO during the 20th
century, and all models have failings. They concluded that it is difficult
to even classify models by the quality of their reproductions of the
behavior of ENSO, because models scored unevenly in their reproduction
of the different phases of the phenomenon. This makes it difficult to
determine which models to use to project future changes in ENSO.
Moreover, most of the models are not able to reproduce the typical
circulation anomalies associated with ENSO in the Southern

"(NAO), the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), and the Indian Ocean Dipole
(IOD) (Trenberth et al., 2007). The NAO is a large-scale seesaw in
atmospheric pressure between the subtropical high and the polar low
in the North Atlantic region. The positive NAO phase has a strong
subtropical high-pressure center and a deeper than normal Icelandic
low. This results in a shift of winter storms crossing the Atlantic Ocean
to a more northerly track, and is associated with warm and wet winters
in northwestern Europe and cold and dry winters in northern Canada
and Greenland. Scaife et al. (2008) discuss the relationship between
the NAO and European extremes. Paleoclimatic data indicate that the
NAO was persistently in its positive phase during medieval times and
persistently in its negative phase during the cooler Little Ice Age (Trouet
et al., 2009). The NAO is closely related to the Northern Annular Mode
(NAM); for brevity we focus here on the NAO but much of what is said
about the NAO also applies to the NAM. The SAM is the largest mode of
Southern Hemisphere extratropical variability and refers to north-south
shifts in atmospheric mass between the middle and high latitudes. It
plays an important role in climate variability in these latitudes. The SAM
positive phase is linked to negative sea level pressure anomalies over
the polar regions and intensified westerlies. It has been associated with
cooler than normal temperatures over most of Antarctica and Australia,
with warm anomalies over the Antarctic Peninsula, southern South
America, and southern New Zealand, and with anomalously dry conditions
over southern South America, New Zealand, and Tasmania and wet
anomalies over much of Australia and South Africa (e.g., Hendon et al.,
2007). The IOD is a coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon in the Indian
Ocean. A positive |OD event is associated with anomalous cooling in the
southeastern equatorial Indian Ocean and anomalous warming in the
western equatorial Indian Ocean. Recent work (Ummenhofer et al., 2008,
2009a,b) has implicated the IOD as a cause of droughts in Australia, and
heavy rainfall in east Africa (Ummenhofer et al., 2009c). There is also
evidence of modes of variability operating on multi-decadal time scales,
notably the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Atlantic Multi-
decadal Oscillation (AMO). Variations in the PDO have been related to
precipitation extremes over North America (Zhang et al., 2010).

such as shipping and offshore activities. Each year, about 90 tropical
cyclones occur globally, and this number has remained roughly steady
over the modern period of geostationary satellites (since around the
mid-1970s). While the global frequency has remained steady, there can
be substantial inter-annual to multi-decadal frequency variability within
individual ocean basins (e.g., Webster et al., 2005). This regional variability,
particularly when combined with substantial inter-annual to multi-decadal
variability in tropical cyclone tracks (e.g., Kossin et al., 2010), presents a

Keenlyside et al. (2008) proposed that variations associated with the

in cyclonic circulation patterns over the Arctic and Antarctica. In the
Southern Hemisphere, two opposing effects, stratospheric ozone recovery
and increasing greenhouse gases, can be expected to affect the modes
such as the SAM (Arblaster et al, 2011). During the 21st century, although
stratospheric ozone concentrations are expected to recover, tending to
lead to a weakening of the SAM, models consistently project polar
vortex intensification to continue due to the increases in greenhouse
gases, except in summer where the competing effects of stratospheric
ozone recovery complicate this picture (Arblaster et al, 2011).

cyclone surge impacts. Tropical cyclones that track poleward can undergo
a transition to become extratropical cyclones. While these storms have

with the ability of models to simulate current behavior of these
natural modes, the influence of competing factors (e.g.,
stratospheric ozone, greenhouse gases) on current and future

(and the seasonal dependence of these projections), means that
there is low confidence in the ability to project changes in the

Global reanalyses of tropical cyclone intensity using a homogenous

a non-stationary bias that inflates trends in measures of intensity

the strongest tropical cyclones remains after this bias is accounted for

variability and trend of power dissipation can be related to SST and
other local factors such as tropopause temperature and vertical wind
shear (Emanuel, 2007), but it is a current topic of debate whether local
SST or the difference between local SST and mean tropical SST is the
more physically relevant metric (Swanson, 2008). The distinction is an
important one when making projections of changes in power dissipation
based on projections of SST changes, particularly in the tropical Atlantic
where SST has been increasing more rapidly than in the tropics as a
whole (Vecchi et al., 2008). Accumulated cyclone energy, which is an
integrated metric analogous to power dissipation, has been declining
globally since reaching a high point in 2005, and is presently at a 40-

increases, as global SST has been rising steadily but at a slower rate
than has the Atlantic (Holland and Webster, 2007). The present period of
relatively enhanced warming in the Atlantic has been proposed to be
due to internal variability (Zhang and Delworth, 2009), anthropogenic
tropospheric aerosols (Mann and Emanuel, 2006), and mineral (dust)
aerosols (Evan et al., 2009). None of these proposed mechanisms provide
a clear expectation that North Atlantic SST will continue to increase at

potential intensity theory (Bister and Emanuel, 1998). In this framework,
the expected response of tropical cyclone intensity to observed climate
change is relatively straightforward: if climate change causes an
increase in the ambient potential intensity that tropical cyclones move
through, the distribution of intensities in a representative sample of
storms is expected to shift toward greater intensities (Emanuel, 2000;
Wing et al., 2007). The fractional changes associated with such a shift
in the distribution would be largest in the upper quantiles of the
distribution as the strongest tropical cyclones become stronger (Elsner

"Given the evidence that SST in the tropics has increased due to
increasing greenhouse gases, and the theoretical expectation that
increases in potential intensity will lead to stronger storms, it is essential
to fully understand the relationship between SST and potential intensity.
Observations demonstrate a strong positive correlation between SST
and the potential intensity. This relationship suggests that SST increases
will lead to increased potential intensity, which will then ultimately lead
to stronger storms (Emanuel, 2000; Wing et al., 2007). However, there is
a growing body of research suggesting that local potential intensity is
controlled by the difference between local SST and spatially averaged
SST in the tropics (Vecchi and Soden, 2007a; Xie et al., 2010; Ramsay
and Sobel, 2011). Since increases in SST due to global warming are not
expected to lead to continuously increasing SST gradients, this recent

identical to the WMO assessment (Knutson et al., 2010): there is low

"Changes in tropical cyclone intensity, frequency, genesis location,
duration, and track contribute to what is sometimes broadly defined as
‘tropical cyclone activity.’ Of these metrics, intensity has the most direct
physically reconcilable link to climate variability within the framework
of potential intensity theory, as described above (Kossin and Vimont,
2007). Statistical correlations between necessary ambient environmental
conditions (e.g., low vertical wind shear and adequate atmospheric
instability and moisture) and tropical cyclogenesis frequency have been
well documented (DeMaria et al., 2001) but changes in these conditions
due specifically to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations do not
necessarily preserve the same statistical relationships. For example, the
observed minimum SST threshold for tropical cyclogenesis is roughly
26°C. This relationship might lead to an expectation that anthropogenic
warming of tropical SST and the resulting increase in the areal extent of
the region of 26°C SST should lead to increases in tropical cyclone
frequency. However, there is a growing body of evidence that the
minimum SST threshold for tropical cyclogenesis increases at about the
same rate as the SST increase due solely to greenhouse gas forcing
(eg., Ryan et al., 1992; Dutton et al, 2000; Yoshimura et al., 2006;
Bengtsson et al., 2007; Knutson et al., 2008; Johnson and Xie, 2010).
This is because the threshold conditions for tropical cyclogenesis are
controlled not just by surface temperature but also by atmospheric
stability (measured from the lower boundary to the tropopause), which
responds to greenhouse gas forcing in a more complex way than SST

the extent of tropical cyclone variability due to random processes and
linkages with various climate modes such as El Nifio, do not presently

incomplete understanding of the physical mechanisms linking tropical

studies project a likely increase in peak wind intensity and near-storm
precipitation in future tropical cyclones. A reduction of the overall

greater reduction in weaker storms in most basins and an increase in the
frequency of the most intense storms. Knutson et al. (2010) concluded
that it is /ikely that the mean maximum wind speed and near-storm
rainfall rates of tropical cyclones will increase with projected 21st-
century warming, and it is more likely than not that the frequency of the
most intense storms will increase substantially in some basins, but it is

"The spatial resolution of some models such as the CMIP3 coupled
ocean-atmosphere models used in the AR4 is generally not high enough
to accurately resolve tropical cyclones, and especially to simulate their
intensity (Randall et al., 2007). Higher-resolution global models have
had some success in reproducing tropical cyclone-like vortices (e.g.,
Chauvin et al., 2006; Oouchi et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2009), but only
their coarse characteristics. Significant progress has been recently
made, however, using downscaling techniques whereby high-resolution
models capable of reproducing more realistic tropical cyclones are run
using boundary conditions provided by either reanalysis data sets or
output fields from lower-resolution climate models such as those used
in the AR4 (e.g., Knutson et al., 2007; Emanuel et al., 2008; Knutson et
al., 2008; Emanuel, 2010). A recent study by Bender et al. (2010) applies
a cascading technique that downscales first from global to regional
scale, and then uses the simulated storms from the regional model to
initialize a very high-resolution hurricane forecasting model. These
downscaling studies have been increasingly successful at reproducing
observed tropical cyclone characteristics, which provides increased
confidence in their projections, and it is expected that more progress
will be made as computing resources improve. Still, awareness that

"Based on a variety of model simulations, the expected long-term
changes in global tropical cyclone characteristics under greenhouse
warming is a decrease or little change in frequency concurrent with an
increase in mean intensity. One of the challenges for identifying these
changes in the existing data records is that the expected changes
predicted by the models are generally small when compared with
changes associated with observed short-term natural variability. Based
on changes in tropical cyclone intensity predicted by idealized numerical
simulations with CO>-induced tropical SST warming, Knutson and Tuleya
(2004) suggested that clearly detectable increases may not be manifest
for decades to come. Their argument was based on a comparison of the
amplitude of the modeled upward trend (ie, the signal) in storm intensity
with the amplitude of the interannual variability (ie., the noise). The
recent high-resolution dynamical downscaling study of Bender et al. (2010)
supports this argument and suggests that the predicted increases in the
frequency of the strongest Atlantic storms may not emerge as a clear
statistically significant signal until the latter half of the 21st century
under the SRES A1B warming scenario. Still, it should be noted that
while these model projections suggest that a statistically significant signal
may not emerge until some future time, the likelihood of more intense
tropical cyclones is projected to continually increase throughout the

to increases in vertical wind shear (Vecchi and Soden, 2007c; Zhao et

(Sugi et al., 2002; Bengtsson et al., 2007) associated with a decrease in
the upward mass flux accompanying deep convection (Held and Soden,
2006), or an increase in the saturation deficit of the middle troposphere
(Emanuel et al., 2008). For individual basins, there is much more
uncertainty in projections of tropical cyclone frequency, with changes of
up to +50% or more projected by various models (Knutson et al., 2010).
When projected SST changes are considered in the absence of projected
radiative forcing changes, Northern Hemisphere tropical cyclone frequency
has been found to increase (Wehner et al., 2010), which is congruent
with the hypothesis that SST changes alone do not capture the relevant
physical mechanisms controlling tropical cyclogenesis (e.g., Emanuel,

"Another type of projection that is sometimes inferred from the literature
is based on extrapolation of an observed statistical relationship (see
also Section 3.2.3). These relationships are typically constructed on past
observed variability that represents a convolution of anthropogenically
forced variability and natural variability across a broad range of time
scales. In general, however, these relationships cannot be expected to
represent all of the relevant physics that control the phenomena of
interest, and their extrapolation beyond the range of the observed
variability they are built on is not reliable. As an example, there is a
strong observed correlation between local SST and tropical cyclone
power dissipation (Emanuel, 2007). If 21st-century SST projections are
applied to this relationship, power dissipation is projected to increase by
about 300% in the next century (Vecchi et al., 2008; Knutson et al.,
2010). Alternatively, there is a similarly strong relationship between
power dissipation and relative SST, which represents the difference
between local and tropical-mean SST and has been argued to serve as
a proxy for local potential intensity (Vecchi and Soden, 2007a). When
21st-century projections of relative SST are considered, this latter
relationship projects almost no change in power dissipation in the next
century (Vecchi et al., 2006). Both of these statistical relationships can
be reasonably defended based on physical arguments but it is not clear
which, if either, is correct (Ramsay and Sobel, 2011).

"When simulating 21st-century warming under the A1B emission scenario
(or a close analog), the present models and downscaling techniques as a
whole are consistent in projecting (1) decreases or no change in tropical
cyclone frequency, (2) increases in intensity and fractional increases in
number of most intense storms, and (3) increases in tropical cyclone-
related rainfall rates. Differences in regional projections lead to lower
confidence in basin-specific projections of intensity and rainfall, and
confidence is particularly low for projections of frequency within
individual basins. More specifically, while projections under 21st-century
greenhouse warming indicate that it is /ikely that the global frequency
of tropical cyclones will either decrease or remain essentially unchanged,
an increase in mean tropical cyclone maximum wind speed is also likely,
although increases may not occur in all tropical regions. This assessment
is essentially identical with that of the recent WMO assessment (Knutson

will either decrease or remain essentially unchanged, it is more likely
than not that the frequency of the most intense storms (e.g., Saffir-
Simpson category 4 and 5) will increase substantially in some ocean
basins, again agreeing with the recent WMO assessment (Knutson et al.,
2010). Based on the level of consistency among models, and physical
reasoning, it is likely that tropical cyclone-related rainfall rates will
increase with greenhouse warming. Confidence in future projections for
particular ocean basins is undermined by the inability of global models

"While detection of long-term past increases in tropical cyclone activity
is complicated by data quality and signal-to-noise issues (as stated
above), theory (Emanuel, 1987) and idealized dynamical models
(Knutson and Tuleya, 2004) both predict increases in tropical cyclone
intensity under greenhouse warming. Recent simulations with high-
resolution dynamical models (Oouchi et al., 2006; Bengtsson et al., 2007;
Gualdi et al., 2008; Knutson et al., 2008; Sugi et al., 2009; Bender et al.,
2010) and statistical-dynamical models (Emanuel, 2007) consistently
find that greenhouse warming causes tropical cyclone intensity to shift
toward stronger storms by the end of the 21st century (2 to 11% increase
in mean maximum wind speed globally). These and other models also
consistently project little change or a reduction in overall tropical
cyclone frequency (e.g., Gualdi et al., 2008; Sugi et al, 2009; Murakami
et al., 2011), but with an accompanying substantial fractional increase
in the frequency of the strongest storms and increased precipitation
rates (in the models for which these metrics were examined). Current
models project changes in overall global frequency ranging from a
decrease of 6 to 34% by the late 21st century (Knutson et al., 2010). The
downscaling experiments of Bender et al. (2010) — which use an 18-
model ensemble-mean of CMIP3 simulations to nudge a high-resolution
dynamical model (Knutson et al., 2008) that is then used to initialize a
very high-resolution dynamical model — project a 28% reduction in the
overall frequency of Atlantic storms and an 80% increase in the frequency
of Saffir-Simpson category 4 and 5 Atlantic hurricanes over the next 80
years (A1B scenario).

"phase changes of water (latent heat release) (Gutowski et al., 1992;
Wernli et al., 2002). Why should we expect climate change to influence
extratropical cyclones? A simplified line of argument would be that both
the large-scale low and high level pole to equator temperature gradients
may change (possibly in opposite directions) in a climate change scenario
leading to a change in the atmospheric instabilities responsible for
cyclone formation and growth (baroclinicity). These changes may be
induced by a variety of mechanisms operating in different parts of the
atmospheric column ranging from changing surface conditions (Deser et
al., 2007; Bader et al., 2011) to stratospheric changes (Son et al., 2010).
In addition, changes in precipitation intensities within extratropical
cyclones may change the latent heat release. According to theories on
wave-mean flow interaction, changes in the extratropical storm tracks are
also associated with changes in the large-scale flow (Robinson, 2000;
Lorenz and Hartmann, 2003). A latitudinal shift of the upper tropospheric
jet would be accompanied by a latitudinal shift in the extratropical
storm track. It is, however, still unclear to what extent a latitudinal shift
in the jet changes the total storm track activity rather than shifting it
latitudinally (Wettstein and Wallace, 2010). Even within the very simplified

wintertime Atlantic trends to be consistent with National Centers for

slightly weaker. There are inconsistencies among studies of extreme

and number of extreme Atlantic cyclones (Geng and Sugi, 2001; Paciorek

identification schemes and different definitions of an extreme cyclone

that a positive NAM/NAO (see Section 3.4.3) corresponds to stronger

temperature gradient. Using reanalyses, both Pezza et al. (2007) and
Lim and Simmonds (2009) have confirmed previous studies showing a
trend toward more intense low-pressure systems. However, the trend of
a decreasing number of cyclones seems to depend on the choice of
reanalysis and pressure level (Lim and Simmonds, 2009), emphasizing
the weaker consistency among reanalysis products for the Southern
Hemisphere extratropical cyclones. Recent studies support the notion
of more cyclones around Antarctica when the SAM (see Section 3.4.3)
is in its positive phase and a shift of cyclones toward mid-latitudes
when the SAM is in its negative phase (Pezza and Simmonds, 2008).
Additionally, more intense (and fewer) cyclones seem to occur when
the PDO (see Section 3.4.3) is strongly positive and vice versa (Pezza et
al., 2007).

"In conclusion, it is likely that there has been a poleward shift in the
main northern and southern storm tracks during the last 50 years. There
is strong agreement with respect to this change between several
reanalysis products for a wide selection of cyclone parameters and
cyclone identification methods and European and Australian pressure-
based storminess proxies are consistent with a poleward shift over the
last 50 years, which indicates that the evidence is robust. Advances have
been made in documenting the observed decadal and multi-decadal
variability of extratropical cyclones using proxies for storminess. So the
recent poleward shift should be seen in light of new studies with longer
time spans that indicate that the last 50 years coincide with relatively
low cyclonic activity in northern coastal Europe in the beginning of the
period. Several studies using reanalyses suggest an intensification of
high-latitude cyclones, but there is still insufficient knowledge of how
changes in the observational systems are influencing the cyclone
intensification in reanalyses so even in cases of high agreement among
the studies the evidence cannot be considered to be robust, thus we
have only low confidence in these changes. Other regional changes in
intensity and the number of cyclones have been reported. However, the
level of agreement between different studies using different tracking
algorithms, different reanalyses, or different cyclone parameters is still
low. Thus, we have /ow confidence in the amplitude, and in some
regions in the sign, of the regional changes.

"Seasonal global sea level pressure changes have been shown to be
inconsistent with simulated internal variability (Giannini et al., 2003;
Gillett et al., 2005; Gillett and Stott, 2009; X.L. Wang et al., 2009a), but
changes in sea level pressure in regions of extratropical cyclones (mid-
and high latitudes) have not formally been attributed to anthropogenic
forcings (Gillett and Stott, 2009). However, the trend pattern in
atmospheric storminess as inferred from geostrophic wind energy and
ocean wave heights has been found to contain a detectable response to
anthropogenic and natural forcings with the effect of external forcings
being strongest in the winter hemisphere (X.L. Wang et al., 2009a).
Nevertheless, the models generally simulate smaller changes than
observed and also appear to underestimate the internal variability,
reducing the robustness of their detection results. New idealized studies
have advanced the physical understanding of how storm tracks may
respond to changes in the underlying surface conditions, indicating that
a uniform SST increase weakens (reduced cyclone intensity or number
of cyclones) and shifts the storm track poleward and strengthened SST
gradients near the subtropical jet may lead to a meridional shift in the
storm track either toward the poles or the equator depending on the
location of the SST gradient change (Deser et al., 2007; Brayshaw et al.,
2008; Semmler et al., 2008; Kodama and Iwasaki, 2009), but the average
global cyclone activity is not expected to change much under moderate
greenhouse gas forcing (O'Gorman and Schneider, 2008; Bengtsson et al.,
2009). Studies have also emphasized the important role of stratospheric
changes (induced by ozone or greenhouse gas changes) in explaining
latitudinal shifts in storm tracks and several mechanisms have been
proposed (Son et al., 2010). This has particularly strengthened the
understanding of the Southern Hemisphere changes. According to Fogt
et al. (2009) both coupled climate models and observed trends in the
SAM were found to be outside the range of internal climate variability
during the austral summer. This was mainly attributed to stratospheric
ozone depletion (see Section 3.4.3).

should be noted that other studies indicate that the poleward shift is
less clear when models including a full stratosphere or ozone recovery
are used (Huebener et al., 2007; Son et al., 2008; Morgenstern et al.,

seen more clearly in upper-level quantities than in low-level transient

the projection of a reduction in extratropical cyclones averaged over the
Northern Hemisphere during future warming (Finnis et al., 2007;
Bengtsson et al., 2009; Orsolini and Sorteberg, 2009). However, neither

"In summary it is likely that there has been a poleward shift in the
main Northern and Southern Hemisphere extratropical storm
tracks during the last 50 years. There is medium confidence in an
anthropogenic influence on this observed poleward shift. It has

an increased anthropogenic forcing will lead to a reduction in the

Regional changes may be substantial and CMIP3 simulations show
some regions with medium agreement. However, there are still
uncertainties related to how the poorly resolved stratosphere in
many CMIP3 models may influence the regional results. In addition,
studies using different analysis techniques, different physical
quantities, different thresholds, and different atmospheric vertical
levels to represent cyclone activity and storm tracks result in
different projections of regional changes. This leads to low

"Detailed analyses of changes in physical mechanisms related to cyclone
changes in coupled climate models are still few. O'Gorman (2010) showed
that changes in mean available potential energy of the atmosphere can
account for much of the varied response in storm-track intensity to
global warming, implying that changes in storm-track intensity are
sensitive to competing effects of changes in temperature gradients and
static stability in different atmospheric levels. Using two coupled climate
models, Laine et al. (2009) indicate that the primary cause for synoptic
activity changes at the western end of the Northern Hemisphere storm
tracks is related to the baroclinic conversion processes linked to mean
temperature gradient changes in localized regions of the western
oceanic basins. They also found downstream changes in latent heat
release during the developing and mature stages of the cyclone to be of
importance and indicated that changes in diabatic process may be
amplified by the upstream baroclinic changes [stronger (weaker)
baroclinic activity in the west gives stronger (weaker) latent heat
release downstream]. Pinto et al. (2009) found that regional increases
in track density and intensity of extreme cyclones close to the British

other studies (Ulbrich et al., 2008; Laine et al., 2009; McDonald, 2011) and
may be attributed to a local minimum in ocean warming in the central
North Atlantic and subsequent local changes in baroclinicity (McDonald,
2011). In line with the eastward shift, Donat et al. (2010a) projected an
increase in wind storm days for central Europe by the end of the 21st
century. The increase varies according to the definition of storminess
and one model projects a decrease. A common deficiency among many
AR4 models is a coarsely resolved stratosphere and there are still
concerns that this may lead to systematic biases in the Atlantic storm
track response to increased anthropogenic forcing (Scaife et al., 2011).
A reduction in cyclone frequency along the Canadian east coast has
been reported (Bengtsson et al., 2006; Watterson, 2006; Pinto et al.,
2007a; Teng et al., 2008; Long et al., 2009). New results for Southern
Hemisphere cyclones confirm the previously projected poleward shift in
storm tracks under increased greenhouse gases (Lim and Simmonds,
2009). That study projected a reduction of Southern Hemisphere
extratropical cyclone frequency and intensity in mid-latitudes but a
slight increase at high latitudes. The poleward shift due to increased
greenhouse gases may be partly opposed by ozone recovery (Son et al.,

"Drought is generally “a period of abnormally dry weather long enough to

While lack of precipitation (i.e., meteorological drought; Box 3-3) is often

induced by enhanced radiation, wind speed, or vapor pressure deficit (itself
linked to temperature and relative humidity), as well as pre-conditioning
(pre-event soil moisture; lake, snow, and/or groundwater storage)

"What Is Drougnt or Dryness?

The Glossary defines drought as follows: “A period of abnormally dry weather long enough to cause a serious hydrological imbalance.
Drought is a relative term, therefore any discussion in terms of precipitation deficit must refer to the particular precipitation-related
activity that is under discussion. For example, shortage of precipitation during the growing season impinges on crop production or
ecosystem function in general (due to soil moisture drought, also termed agricultural drought), and during the runoff and percolation
season primarily affects water supplies (hydrological drought). Storage changes in soil moisture and groundwater are also affected by
increases in actual evapotranspiration in addition to reductions in precipitation. A period with an abnormal precipitation deficit is
defined as a meteorological drought. A megadrought is a very lengthy and pervasive drought, lasting much longer than normal, usually a
decade or more.”
"	Text
"As highlighted in the above definition, drought can be defined from different perspectives, depending on the stakeholders involved. The
scientific literature commonly distinguishes meteorological drought, which refers to a deficit of precipitation, soi! moisture drought
(often called agricultural drought), which refers to a deficit of (mostly root zone) soil moisture, and hydrological drought, which refers to
negative anomalies in streamflow, lake, and/or groundwater levels (e.g., Heim Jr., 2002). We use here the term ‘soil moisture drought’
instead of ‘agricultural drought,’ despite the widespread use of the latter term (e.g., Heim Jr., 2002; Wang, 2005), because soil moisture
deficits have several additional effects beside those on agroecosystems, most importantly on other natural or managed ecosystems
(including both forests and pastures), on building infrastructure through soil mechanical processes (e.g., Corti et al., 2009), and health
through impacts on heat waves (Section 3.1.4). Water scarcity (linked to socioeconomic drought), which may be caused fully or in part
by use from human activities, does not lie within the scope of this chapter (see Section 4.2.2); however, it should be noted that changing
pressure on water resources by human uses may itself influence climate and possibly the drought conditions, for example, via declining
groundwater levels, or enhanced local evapotranspiration and associated land-atmosphere feedbacks. Drought should not be confused
with aridity, which describes the general characteristic of an arid climate (e.g., desert). Indeed, drought is considered a recurring feature
of climate occurring in any region and is defined with respect to the average climate of the given region (e.g., Heim Jr., 2002; Dai, 2011).
Nonetheless, the effects of droughts are not linear, given the existence of, for example, discrete soil moisture thresholds affecting
vegetation and surface fluxes (e.g., Koster et al., 2004b; Seneviratne et al., 2010), which means that the same precipitation deficit or
radiation excess relative to normal will not affect different regions equally (e.g., short-term lack of precipitation in a very humid region
may not be critical for agriculture because of the ample soil moisture supply). In this chapter we often use the term ‘dryness’ instead of
‘drought’ as a more general term.

Because of the complex definition of droughts, and the lack of soil moisture observations (Section 3.2.1), several indices have been
developed to characterize (meteorological, soil moisture, and hydrological) drought (see, e.g., Heim Jr., 2002; Dai, 2011). These indicators
include land surface, hydrological, or climate model simulations (providing estimates of, e.g., soil moisture or runoff) and indices based
on measured meteorological or hydrological variables. We provide here a brief overview of the wide range of drought indices used in the
literature for the analysis of recent and projected changes. Note that information on paleoclimate proxies such as tree rings,

For soil moisture or hydrological droughts, the main drivers are reduced precipitation and/or increased evapotranspiration (Figure 3-9).
Although the role of deficits in precipitation is generally considered more prominently in the literature, several drought indicators also
explicitly or indirectly consider effects of evapotranspiration. In the context of climate projections, analyses suggest that changes in
simulated soil moisture drought are mostly driven by changes in precipitation, with increased evapotranspiration from higher vapor pressure
deficit (often linked to increased temperature) and available radiation modulating some of the changes (e.g., Burke and Brown, 2008;
Sheffield and Wood, 2008a; Orlowsky and Seneviratne, 2011). It should nonetheless be noted that under strong drought conditions, soil
moisture becomes limiting for evapotranspiration, thus limits further soil moisture depletion. Other important aspects for soil moisture
and hydrological droughts are persistence and pre-conditioning. Because soil moisture, groundwater, and surface waters are associated
with water storage, they have a characteristic memory (e.g., Vinnikov et al., 1996; Eltahir and Yeh, 1999; Koster and Suarez, 2001;
Seneviratne et al, 2006b) and thus specific response times to drought forcing (e.g., Begueria et al., 2010; Fleig et al., 2011). The memory
is also a function of the atmospheric forcing and system's feedbacks
"	Text
"Some indices are based solely on precipitation data. A widely used index is the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) (McKee et al., 1993;
Lloyd-Hughes and Saunders, 2002), which consists of fitting and transforming a long-term precipitation record into a normal distribution
that has zero mean and unit standard deviation. SPI values of -0.5 to -1 correspond to mild droughts, -1 to -1.5 to moderate droughts,
-1.5 to -2 to severe droughts, and below -2 to extreme droughts. Similarly, values from 0 to 2 correspond to mildly wet to severely wet
conditions, and values above 2 to extremely wet conditions (Lloyd-Hughes and Saunders, 2002). SPI can be computed over several time
scales (e.g., 3, 6, 12, or more months) and thus indirectly considers effects of accumulating precipitation deficits, which are critical for
soil moisture and hydrological droughts. Another index commonly used in the analysis of climate model simulations is the Consecutive
Dry Days (CDD) index, which considers the maximum consecutive number of days without rain (i.e., below a given threshold, typically

1 mm day""!) within a considered period (i.e., year in general; Frich et al., 2002; Alexander et al., 2006; Tebaldi et al., 2006). For seasonal
time frames, the CDD periods can either be considered to be bound to the respective seasons (e.g., Figure 3-10) or considered in their
entirety (across seasons) but assigned to a specific season. Though SPI and CDD are both only based on precipitation, they do not
necessarily only consider the effects of meteorological drought, since periods without rain (thus less cloud cover) are bound to have
higher daytime radiation forcing and generally higher temperatures, thus possibly positive evapotranspiration anomalies (unless soil
moisture conditions are too dry and limit evapotranspiration).

"In summary, drought indices often integrate precipitation, temperature, and other variables, but may emphasize different
aspects of drought and should be carefully selected with respect to the drought characteristic in mind. In particular, some
indices have specific shortcomings, especially in the context of climate change. For this reason, assessments of changes in
drought characteristics with climate change should consider several indices including a specific evaluation of their relevance
to the addressed question to support robust conclusions. In this assessment we focus on the following indices: consecutive
dry days (CDD) and simulated soil moisture anomalies (SMA), although evidence based on other indices (e.g., PDSI for
present climate) is also considered (Section 3.5.1; Tables 3-2 and 3-3).
"	Text
"The indices listed above have been used in various studies analyzing drought in the context of climate change, but with a few exceptions
most available studies are based only on one index, which makes their comparison difficult. Nonetheless, these studies suggest that
projections can be highly dependent on the choice of drought index. For instance, one study projected changes in drought area possibly
varying between a negligible impact and a 5 to 45% increase depending on the drought index considered (Burke and Brown, 2008).
Other drought indices are used to quantify hydrological drought (e.g., Heim Jr., 2002; Vidal et al., 2010; Dai, 2011), but are less
commonly used in climate change studies. Further analyses or indices also consider the area affected by droughts (e.g., Burke et al.,
2006; Sheffield and Wood, 2008a; Dai, 2011) or additional variables (such as snow or vegetation indices from satellite measurements,
e.g., Heim Jr., 2002). As for the definition of other indices (Box 3-1), the determination of the reference period is critical for the assessment
of changes in drought patterns independently of the chosen index. In general, late 20th-century conditions are used as reference (e.g.,
Figure 3-10).

"For the assessment of soil moisture drought, simulated soil moisture anomalies also can be considered (Wang et al., 2005; Burke and
Brown, 2008; Sheffield and Wood, 2008a; A.H. Wang et al., 2009; Dai, 2011; Orlowsky and Seneviratne, 2011). Simulated soil moisture
anomalies integrate the effects of precipitation forcing, simulated actual evapotranspiration (resulting from atmospheric forcing and
simulated soil moisture limitation on evapotranspiration), and simulated soil moisture persistence. Although the soil moisture simulated
by (land-surface, hydrological, and climate) models often exhibits strong discrepancies in absolute terms, soil moisture anomalies can be
compared with simple scaling and generally match reasonably well (e.g., Koster et al, 2009; A.H. Wang et al., 2009). Soil moisture
persistence is found to be an important component in projected changes in soil moisture drought, with some regions displaying year-
round dryness compared to reference (late 20th or pre-industrial) conditions due to the carry-over effect of soil moisture storage from
season to season, leading to year-round soil moisture deficits compared to late 20th century climate (e.g., Wang et al., 2005, Figure 3-10).
However, it should be noted that some land surface and hydrological models (used offline or coupled to climate models) suffer from
similar shortcomings as noted above for PDSI — that is, they use simple bucket models or simplified representations of potential
evapotranspiration. The latter issue has been suggested as being particularly critical for models used in offline mode (Milly and Dunne,
2011). Nonetheless, for the assessment of soil moisture drought, using simulated soil moisture anomalies seems less problematic than
many other indices for the reasons highlighted in the above paragraphs.

"(Palmer, 1965), which measures the departure of moisture balance from normal conditions using a simple water balance model (e.g., Dai,
2011), as well as other indices such as the Precipitation Potential Evaporation Anomaly (PPEA, based on the cumulative difference
between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration) used in Burke and Brown (2008) and the Standardized Precipitation-
Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI, which considers cumulated anomalies of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration) described in
Vicente-Serrano et al. (2010). PDSI has been widely used for decades (in particular in the United States), and also in climate change
analyses (e.g., Dai et al., 2004; Burke and Brown, 2008; Dai, 2011); however, it has some shortcomings for climate change monitoring
and projection. PDS! was originally calibrated for the central United States, which can impair the comparability of the index across
regions (and also across time periods if drought mechanisms change over time). Thus it is often of advantage to renormalize the local
PDSI (Dai, 2011), which can also be done using the self-calibrated PDS! (Wells et al., 2004), but several studies do not apply these steps.
Moreover, the land surface model underlying the computation of the PDS! is essentially a simple bucket-type model, which is less
sophisticated than more recent land surface and hydrological models and thus implies several limitations (e.g., Dai et al, 2004; Burke et
al., 2006). Another important issue is that the parameterization of potential evapotranspiration as empirically (and solely) dependent on
air temperature, which is often applied for these various indices (e.g., in the study of Dai et al., 2004) can lead to biased results (e.g.,
Donohue et al., 2010; Milly and Dunne, 2011; Shaw and Riha, 2011). Temperature is only an indirect driver of evapotranspiration, via its
effect on vapor pressure deficit and via effects on vegetation phenology. Furthermore, approaches using potential evapotranspiration as
a proxy for actual evapotranspiration do not consider soil moisture and vegetation control on evapotranspiration, which are important
mechanisms limiting drought development.

that very dry areas had more than doubled in extent since 1970 at the
global scale (Trenberth et al., 2007). This assessment was, however,
largely based on the study by Dai et al. (2004) only. These trends in the
PDSI proxy were found to be largely affected by changes in temperature,
not precipitation (Dai et al., 2004). On the other hand, based on soil
moisture simulations with an observation-driven land surface model for
the time period 1950-2000, Sheffield and Wood (2008a) have inferred
trends in drought duration, intensity, and severity predominantly
decreasing, but with strong regional variation and including increases in
some regions. They concluded that there was an overall moistening trend
over the considered time period, but also a switch since the 1970s to a
drying trend, globally and in many regions, especially in high northern
latitudes. Some regional studies are consistent with the results from
Sheffield and Wood (2008a), regarding, for example, less widespread
increase (or statistically insignificant changes or decreases) in some
regions compared to the study of Dai et al. (2004) (e.g., in Europe, see
below). More recently, Dai (2011) by extending the record did, however,
find widespread increases in drought both based on various versions of
PDSI (for 1950-2008) and soil moisture output from a land surface model
(for 1948-2004). Hence there are still large uncertainties with respect to
global assessments of past changes in droughts. Nonetheless, there is
some agreement between studies over the different time frames (i.e,
since 1950 versus 1970) and using different drought indicators regarding
increasing drought occurrence in some regions (e.g., southern Europe,
West Africa; see below and Table 3-2), although other regions also indicate
opposite trends (e.g., central North America, northwestern Australia; see
below and Table 3-2). As mentioned in Section 3.1.6, spatially coherent
shifts in drought regimes are expected with changing global circulation
patterns. Table 3-2 provides regional and continental-scale assessments
of observed trends in dryness based on different indices (Box 3-3). The

confidence in observed trends in dryness due to lack of direct observations,

since the 1950s some regions of the world have experienced more
intense and longer droughts (e.g., southern Europe, west Africa) but

"For Australia, Sheffield and Wood (2008a) found very limited increases
in dryness from 1950 to 2000 based on soil moisture simulated using
existing climate forcing (mostly in southeastern Australia) and some
marked decreases in dryness in central Australia and the northwestern
part of the continent. Dai (2011), for an extended period until 2008 and
using different PDSI variants as well as soil moisture output from a land
surface model, found a more extended drying trend in the eastern half
of the continent, but also a decrease in dryness in most of the western
half. Jung et al. (2010) inferred from a combination of remote sensing
and quasi-globally distributed eddy covariance flux observations that in
particular the decade after 1998 became drier in Australia (and parts of
Africa and South America), leading to decreased evapotranspiration, but
it is not clear if this is a trend or just decadal variation.

droughts in Amazonia are, however, considered the strongest in the last
century as inferred from integrating precipitation records and water
storage estimates via satellite (measurements from the Gravity
Recovery and Climate Experiment; Chen et al., 2009; Lewis et al., 2011).
For other parts of South America, analyses of the return intervals
between droughts in the instrumental and reconstructed precipitation
series indicate that the probability of drought has increased during the
late 19th and 20th centuries, consistent with selected long instrumental
precipitation records and with a recession of glaciers in the Chilean and
Argentinean Andean Cordillera (Le Quesne et al., 2006, 2009).

"There is now a better understanding of the potential role of land-
atmosphere feedbacks versus SST forcing for meteorological droughts
(e.g., Schubert et al., 2008a,b), and some modeling studies have also
addressed potential impacts of land use changes (e.g., Deo et al., 2009),
but large uncertainties remain in the field of land surface modeling and
land-atmosphere interactions, in part due to lack of observations
(Seneviratne et al., 2010), inter-model discrepancies (Koster et al., 2004b;
Dirmeyer et al., 2006; Pitman et al., 2009), and model resolution of
orographic and other effects. Nonetheless, a new set of climate modeling
studies show that US drought response to SST variability is consistent
with observations (Schubert et al., 2009). Inferred trends in drought are
also consistent with trends in global precipitation and temperature, and
the latter two are consistent with expected responses to anthropogenic
forcing (Hegerl et al., 2007; X. Zhang et al., 2007). The change in the pattern
of global precipitation in the observations and in model simulations is
also consistent with the theoretical understanding of hydrological
response to global warming that wet regions become overall wetter
and dry regions drier in a warming world (Held and Soden, 2006; see
also Section 3.1.6), though some regions also display shifts in climate
regimes (Section 3.1.6). Nonetheless, some single events have been
reported as differing from projections (Seager et al., 2009), though this is
not necessarily incompatible given the superimposition of anthropogenic
climate change and natural climate variability (Section 3.1). For soil
moisture and hydrological drought it has been suggested that the
stomatal ‘antitranspirant’ responses of plants to rising atmospheric CO>
may lead to a decrease in evapotranspiration (Gedney et al., 2006). This
could mean that increasing CO levels alleviate soil moisture and
streamflow drought, but this result is still debated (e.g., Piao et al.,
2007; Gerten et al., 2008), in particular due to the uncertainty in
observed runoff trends used to infer these effects (eg., Peel and
McMahon, 2006; see also Section 3.2.1).

"Overall, though new studies have furthered the understanding of the
mechanisms leading to drought, there is still relatively limited evidence
to provide an attribution of observed changes, in particular given the
issues associated with the availability of observational data (Section 3.2.1)
and the definition and computation of drought indicators (Box 3-3). This
latter point was mostly identified in post-AR4 studies (Box 3-3). Moreover,
regions where consistent increases in drought are identified (see ‘Observed
Changes’) are only partly consistent with those where projections indicate
an enhancement of drought conditions in coming decades (see next
paragraphs). We thus assess that there is medium confidence (see also
Section 3.1.5) that anthropogenic influence has contributed to some
changes in the drought patterns observed in the second half of the 20th
century, based on its attributed impact on precipitation and temperature
changes (though temperature can only be indirectly related to drought
trends; see Box 3-3). However there is /ow confidence in the attribution
of changes in droughts at the level of individual regions.

"More recent global and regional climate simulations and hydrological
models mostly support the projections from the AR4, as summarized in the
following paragraphs (see also Table 3-3), although we assess the overall
confidence in drought projections as medium given the definitional
issues associated with dryness and the partial lack of agreement in
model projections when based on different dryness indices (Box 3-3).
Indeed, particular care is needed in inter-comparing ‘drought’ projections
since very many different definitions are employed (corresponding to
different types of droughts), from simple climatic indices such as CDD
to more complex indices of soil moisture and hydrological drought (Box
3-3). A distinction also needs to be made between short-term and
longer-term events. Blenkinsop and Fowler (2007a) and Burke et al.
(2010), for example, show different trend strength, and sometimes sign
(Blenkinsop and Fowler, 2007a), for changes in short- and long-term
droughts with RCM ensembles applied to the United Kingdom
(although uncertainties in the latter projections are large; see below).
These various distinctions are generally not considered and most
currently available studies only assess changes in very few (most
commonly one or two) dryness indices.

"and SMA; for definitions, see Box 3-3) using two model ensembles: one
based on a GCM expressing uncertainty in parameter space, and a multi-
model ensemble of 11 GCM simulations from CMIP3. Their analysis
revealed that SPI, based solely on precipitation, showed little change in
the proportion of the land surface in drought, and that all other indices,
which include a measure of the atmospheric demand for moisture,
showed a statistically significant increase with an additional 5 to 45% of
the land surface in drought. This study also highlighted large uncertainties
in regional changes in drought. For reasons highlighted in Box 3-3, using
simulated soil moisture anomalies from the climate models avoids some
shortcomings of other commonly used indices (although the quality of
simulated soil moisture cannot be well evaluated due to lack of
observations; Section 3.2 and Box 3-3). In the study of Burke and Brown
(2008), this index showed weaker drying compared to PDS! and PPEA
indices (but more pronounced drying than the SPI index). In this report,
we display projected changes in soil moisture anomalies and CDD
(Figure 3-10), this latter index being chosen for continuity with the AR4
(see Figure 10.18 of that report). It can be seen that the two indices
partly agree on increased drought in some large regions (e.g., on the
annual time scale, in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean region,
central Europe, central North America, Central America and Mexico,
northeast Brazil, and southern Africa), but some regions where the models
show consistent increases in CDD (e.g., southeast Asia) do not show
consistent decreases in soil moisture. Conversely, regions displaying a
consistent decrease in CDD (e.g., in northeastern Asia) do not show a
consistent increase in soil moisture. The substantial uncertainty of drought
projections is particularly clear from the soil moisture projections, with,
for example, no agreement among the models regarding the sign of
changes in December to February over most of the globe. These results
regarding changes in CDD and soil moisture are consistent with other
published studies (Wang, 2005; Tebaldi et al., 2006; Burke and Brown,
2008; Sheffield and Wood, 2008b; Sillmann and Roeckner, 2008) and the
areas that display consistent increasing drought tendencies for both
indices have also been reported to display such tendencies for additional
indices (e.g., Burke and Brown, 2008; Dai, 2011; Table 3-3). Sheffield and
Wood (2008b) examined projections in drought frequency (for droughts
of duration of 4 to 6 months and longer than 12 months, estimated from
soil moisture anomalies) based on CMIP3 simulations with eight GCMs
and the SRES scenarios A2, A1B, and B1. They concluded that drought was
projected to increase in several regions under these three scenarios
(mostly consistent with those displayed in Figure 3-10 for SMA),
although the projections of drought intensification were stronger for the
high CO, emissions scenarios (A2 and A1B) than for the more moderate
scenario (B1). Regions showing statistically significant increases in drought
frequency were found to be broadly similar for all three scenarios,
despite the more moderate signal in the B1 scenario (their Figures 8 and
9). This study also highlighted the large uncertainty of scenarios for
drought projections, as scenarios were found to span a large range of
changes in drought frequency in most regions, from close to no change
to two- to three-fold increases (their Figure 10).

"Increased confidence in modeling drought stems from consistency
between models and satisfactory simulation of drought indices during
the past century (Sheffield and Wood, 2008a; Sillmann and Roeckner,

larger spatial scales (in some regions, see above discussion), while local to
regional and short-term precipitation deficits are highly spatially variable
and much less consistent between models (Blenkinsop and Fowler,
2007b). Insufficient knowledge of the physical causes of meteorological
droughts, and of the links to the large-scale atmospheric and ocean
circulation, is still a source of uncertainty in drought simulations and
projections. For example, plausible explanations have been proposed for
projections of both a worsening drought and a substantial increase in
rainfall in the Sahara (Biasutti et al., 2009; Burke et al., 2010). Another
example is illustrated with the relationship of rainfall in southern

Mediterranean (summer) droughts are projected to start earlier in the
year and last longer. Also, increased variability during the dry and warm
season is projected (Giorgi, 2006). One GCM-based study projected one
to three weeks of additional dry days for the Mediterranean region by
the end of the century (Giannakopoulos et al., 2009). For North America,
intense and heavy episodic rainfall events with high runoff amounts
are interspersed with longer relatively dry periods with increased
evapotranspiration, particularly in the subtropics. There is a consensus of
most climate model projections for a reduction in cool season precipitation
across the US southwest and northwest Mexico (Christensen et al., 2007),
with more frequent multi-year drought in the US southwest (Seager et al.,
2007; Cayan et al., 2010). Reduced cool season precipitation promotes
drier summer conditions by reducing the amount of soil water available
for evapotranspiration in summer. For Australia, Alexander and Arblaster
(2009) project increases in consecutive dry days, although consensus
between models is only found in the interior of the continent. African
studies indicate the possibility of relatively small-scale (500-km)
heterogeneity of changes in precipitation and drought, based on climate
model simulations (Funk et al., 2008; Shongwe et al., 2009). Regional
climate simulations of South America project spatially coherent increases
in CDD, particularly large over the Brazilian Plateau, and northern Chile
and the Altiplano (Kitoh et al., 2011).

"There are still further sources of uncertainties affecting the projections
of trends in meteorological drought for the coming century. The two
most important may be uncertainties in the development of the ocean
circulation and feedbacks between land surface and atmospheric
processes. These latter processes are related to the effects of drought on
vegetation physiology and dynamics (e.g., affecting canopy conductance,
albedo, and roughness), with resulting (positive or negative) feedbacks
to precipitation formation (Findell and Eltahir, 2003a,b; Koster et al.,
2004b; Cook et al., 2006; Hohenegger et al., 2009; Seneviratne et al.,
2010; van den Hurk and van Meijgaard, 2010), and possibly — as only
recently highlighted — also feedbacks between droughts, fires, and
aerosols (Bevan et al., 2009). Furthermore, the development of soil
moisture that results from complex interactions among precipitation,
water storage as soil moisture (and snow), and evapotranspiration by
vegetation is still associated with large uncertainties, in particular
because of lack of observations of soil moisture and evapotranspiration
(Section 3.2.1), and issues in the representation of soil moisture-
evapotranspiration coupling in current climate models (Dirmeyer et al.,
2006; Seneviratne et al., 2010). Uncertainties regarding soil moisture-
climate interactions are also due to uncertainties regarding the behavior
of plant transpiration, growth, and water use efficiency under enhanced
atmospheric CO, concentrations, which could potentially have impacts
on the hydrological cycle (Betts et al., 2007), but are not well understood
yet (Hungate et al, 2003; Piao et al., 2007; Bonan, 2008; Teuling et al.,
2009; see also above discussion on the causes of observed changes).
The space-time development of hydrological drought as a response to a
meteorological drought and the associated soil moisture drought
(drought propagation, e.g., Peters et al., 2003) also needs more attention.
There is some understanding of these issues at the catchment scale
(eg., Tallaksen et al., 2009), but these need to be extended to the
regional and continental scales. This would lead to better understanding
of the projections of hydrological droughts, which would contribute to
a better identification and attribution of droughts and help to improve
global hydrological models and land surface models.

surface model of a GCM or RCM and a river routing model. Different
hydrological models may yield quantitatively different river discharge,
but they may not yield different signs of the trend if the same GCM/
RCM outputs are used. So the ability of models to simulate floods, in
particular regarding the signs of the past and future trends, depends on
the ability of the GCM or RCM to simulate precipitation changes. The
ability of a GCM or RCM to simulate temperature is important for river
discharge simulation in snowmelt- and glacier-fed rivers. Downscaling
and/or bias-correction are frequently applied to GCM/RCM outputs
before hydrological simulations are conducted, which becomes a source
of uncertainty. More details on the feasibility and uncertainties in
hydrological projections are described later in this section. Coastal

"Worldwide instrumental records of floods at gauge stations are limited
in spatial coverage and in time, and only a limited number of gauge
stations have data that span more than 50 years, and even fewer more
than 100 years (Rodier and Roche, 1984; see also Section 3.2.1). However,
this can be overcome partly or substantially by using pre-instrumental
flood data from documentary records (archival reports, in Europe
continuous over the last 500 years) (Brazdil et al., 2005), and from
geological indicators of paleofloods (sedimentary and biological records
over centennial to millennial scales) (Kochel and Baker, 1982). Analysis
of these pre-instrumental flood records suggest that (1) flood magnitude
and frequency can be sensitive to modest alterations in atmospheric
circulation, with greater sensitivity for ‘rare’ floods (e.g., 50-year flood and
higher) than for smaller and more frequent floods (e.g., 2-year floods)
(Knox, 2000; Redmond et al., 2002); (2) high interannual and interdecadal
variability can be found in flood occurrences both in terms of frequency
and magnitude although in most cases, cyclic or clusters of flood
occurrence are observed in instrumental (Robson et al., 1998), historical
(Vallve and Martin-Vide, 1998; Benito et al., 2003; Llasat et al., 2005),
and paleoflood records (Ely et al., 1993; Benito et al., 2008); (3) past
flood records may contain analogs of unusual large floods, similar to
some recorded recently, sometimes considered to be the largest on
record. For example, pre-instrumental flood data show that the 2002
summer flood in the Elbe did not reach the highest flood levels recorded
in 1118 and 1845 although it was higher than other disastrous floods
of 1432, 1805, etc. (Brazdil et al., 2006). However, the currently available
pre-instrumental flood data is also limited, particularly in spatial coverage.

"A flood is “the overflowing of the normal confines of a stream or other
body of water, or the accumulation of water over areas that are not
normally submerged (some specific examples are discussed in Case Study
9.2.6). Floods include river (fluvial) floods, flash floods, urban floods,
pluvial floods, sewer floods, coastal floods, and glacial lake outburst
floods” (see Glossary). The main causes of floods are intense and/or
long-lasting precipitation, snow/ice melt, a combination of these causes,
dam break (e.g., glacial lakes), reduced conveyance due to ice jams or
landslides, or by a local intense storm (Smith and Ward, 1998). Floods
are affected by various characteristics of precipitation, such as intensity,
duration, amount, timing, and phase (rain or snow). They are also affected
by drainage basin conditions such as water levels in the rivers, the
presence of snow and ice, soil character and status (frozen or not, soil
moisture content and vertical distribution), rate and timing of snow/ice
melt, urbanization, and the existence of dikes, dams, and reservoirs (Bates
et al., 2008). Along coastal areas, flooding may be associated with storm
surge events (Section 3.5.5). A change in the climate physically changes
many of the factors affecting floods (e.g., precipitation, snow cover, soil
moisture content, sea level, glacial lake conditions, vegetation) and thus
may consequently change the characteristics of floods. Engineering
developments such as dikes and reservoirs regulate flow, and land use
may also affect floods. Therefore the assessment of causes of changes
in floods is complex and difficult. The focus in this section is on changes
in floods that might be related to changes in climate (ie., referred to as
‘climate-driven’), rather than changes in engineering developments or
land use. However, because of partial lack of documentation, these can

impact of anthropogenic climate change on changes (mostly increases)

"The above analysis indicates that research subsequent to the AR4 still
does not show clear and widespread evidence of climate-driven
observed changes in the magnitude or frequency of floods at the global
level based on instrumental records, and there is thus low confidence
regarding the magnitude and frequency and even the sign of these
changes. The main reason for this lack of confidence is due to limited
evidence in many regions, since available instrumental records of floods
at gauge stations are limited in space and time, which limits the number
of analyses. Moreover, the confounding effects of changes in land use
and engineering mentioned above also make the identification of
climate-driven trends difficult. There are limited regions with medium
evidence, where no ubiquitous change is apparent (low agreement).
Pre-instrumental flood data can provide information for longer periods,
but current availability of these data is even scarcer particularly in spatial
coverage. There is abundant evidence for an earlier occurrence of spring

recently emerged that anthropogenic climate change could have
increased the risk of rainfall-dominated flood occurrence in some river
basins in the United Kingdom in autumn 2000 (Pall et al., 2011). Overall,
there is low confidence (due to limited evidence) that anthropogenic
climate change has affected the magnitude and frequency of floods,
though it has detectably influenced several components of the
hydrological cycle, such as precipitation and snowmelt, that may impact
flood trends. The assessment of causes behind the changes in floods is
inherently complex and difficult.

"In climates where seasonal snow storage and melting play a significant
role in annual runoff, the hydrologic regime is affected by changes in
temperature. In a warmer world, a smaller portion of precipitation falls
as snow (Hirabayashi et al., 2008a) and the melting of winter snow
occurs earlier in spring, resulting in a shift in peak river runoff to winter
and early spring. This has been observed in the western United States
(Regonda et al., 2005; Clow, 2010), in Canada (Zhang et al., 2001), and
in other cold regions (Rosenzweig et al, 2007; Shiklomanov et al.,
2007), along with an earlier breakup of river ice in Arctic rivers (Smith,
2000; Beltaos and Prowse, 2009). The observed trends toward earlier
timing of snowmelt-driven streamflows in the western United States
since 1950 are detectably different from natural variability (Barnett et
al., 2008; Hidalgo et al., 2009). Thus, observed warming over several
decades that is attributable to anthropogenic forcing has likely been
linked to earlier spring peak flows in snowmelt- and glacier-fed rivers. It
is unclear if observed warming over several decades has affected the
magnitude of the snowmelt peak flows, but warming may result either
in an increase in spring peak flows where winter snow depth increases
(Meehl et al., 2007b) or a decrease in spring peak flows because of
decreased snow cover and amounts (Hirabayashi et al., 2008b; Dankers
and Feyen, 2009).

"Uncertainty is still large in the projected changes in the magnitude and
frequency of floods. It has been recently recognized that the choice of
GCMs is the largest source of uncertainties in hydrological projections
at the catchment/river-basin scale, and that uncertainties from emission
scenarios and downscaling methods are also relevant but less important
(Graham et al., 2007; Leander et al., 2008; Kay et al., 2009; Prudhomme
and Davies, 2009), although, in general, hydrological projections require
downscaling and/or bias-correction of GCM outputs (e.g., precipitation
and temperature). Also the choice of hydrological models was found to
be relevant but less important (Kay et al., 2009; Taye et al., 2011).
However, the relative importance of downscaling, bias-correction, and
the choice of hydrological models may depend on the selected region/
catchment, the selected downscaling and bias-correction methods, and
the selected hydrological models (Wilby et al., 2008). For example, the
sign of the above-mentioned flood changes in northeastern Europe is
affected by differences in temporal downscaling and bias-correction
methods applied in the different studies (Dankers and Feyen, 2009).
Chen et al. (2011) demonstrated considerable uncertainty caused by
several downscaling methods in a hydrological projection for a
snowmelt-dominated Canadian catchment. Downscaling (see Section
3.2.3) and bias-correction are also a major source of uncertainty in rain-
dominated catchments (van Pelt et al., 2009). We also note that bias-
correction and statistical downscaling tend to ignore the energy closure
of the climate system, which could be a non-negligible source of
uncertainty in hydrological projections (Milly and Dunne, 2011).

Kundzewicz et al. (2007) and Bates et al. (2008), physical reasoning

(medium confidence). We note that heavy precipitation may be projected
to increase despite a projected decrease of total precipitation depending
on the regions considered (Section 3.3.2), and that changes in several
variables (e.g., precipitation totals, frequency, and intensity, snow cover
and snowmelt, soil moisture) are relevant for changes in floods.
Confidence in change in one of these components alone may thus not
be sufficient to confidently project changes in flood occurrence. Hence,
medium confidence is attached to the above statement based on
physical reasoning, although the link between increases in heavy
rainfall and increases in local flooding seems apparent. The earlier shifts
of spring peak flows in snowmelt- and glacier-fed rivers are robustly
projected (Kundzewicz et al., 2007; Bates et al., 2008); so these are
assessed as very likely, though this may not necessarily be relevant for

"In summary, there is limited to medium evidence available to
assess climate-driven observed changes in the magnitude and

instrumental records of floods at gauge stations are limited in

in this evidence, and thus overall low confidence at the global

confidence (due to limited evidence) that anthropogenic climate
change has affected the magnitude or frequency of floods,
though it has detectably influenced several components of the
hydrological cycle such as precipitation and snowmelt (medium

Projected precipitation and temperature changes imply possible
changes in floods, although overall there is low confidence in
projections of changes in fluvial floods. Confidence is low due to
limited evidence and because the causes of regional changes are
complex, although there are exceptions to this statement. There is
medium confidence (based on physical reasoning) that projected
increases in heavy rainfall (Section 3.3.2) would contribute to
increases in rain-generated local flooding, in some catchments or

"weather events such as tropical or extratropical cyclones (Sections 3.4.4
and 3.4.5) can produce storm surges at the coast, which may be further
elevated by wave setup caused by an onshore flux of momentum due to
wave breaking in the surf zone. Various metrics are used to characterize
extreme sea levels including storm-related highest values, annual
maxima, or percentiles. Extreme sea levels may change in the future a:
a result of both changes in atmospheric storminess and mean sea level

globe. For severe storm events such as tropical and extratropical
cyclones, changes may occur in the frequency, intensity, or genesis
regions of severe storms and such changes may vary between ocean
basins (see Sections 3.4.4 and 3.4.5). Along some coastlines, lanc
subsidence due to glacial isostatic adjustment (e.g., Lambeck et al.,
2010) is causing a relative fall in sea levels. Variations in the rate of sea
level rise can be large relative to mean sea level (Yin et al, 2010) anc
will occur as a result of variations in wind change (e.g., Timmermann et

and rates of thermal expansion (e.g., Bindoff et al., 2007; Church et al.,
2010; Yin et al., 2010). In addition, if rapid melting of ice sheets occurs
it would lead to non-uniform rates of sea level rise across the globe due
to adjustments in the Earth's gravitational field (e.g., Mitrovica et al.,
2010). On some coastlines, higher mean sea levels may alter the
astronomical tidal range and the evolution of storm surges, and
increase the wave height in the surf zones. As well as gradual increase:
in mean sea level that contribute to extreme impacts from transient
extreme sea levels, rapid changes in sea level arising from, for example,
collapse of ice shelves could be considered to be an extreme event with
the potential to contribute to extreme impacts in the future. However,

the faster rate of increase during the latter period reflects decadal

there is evidence that the contribution to sea level due to mass loss
from Greenland and Antarctica is accelerating (Velicogna, 2009; Rignot

in mean sea level and variations in regional climate led to a likely
increase in the trend of extreme high water worldwide in the late 20th

to sea level rise during the latter half of the 20th century (Hegerl et al.,

gauges across the globe, have confirmed the earlier conclusions of
Woodworth and Blackman (2004) that there was an increasing trend in
extreme sea levels globally, more pronounced since the 1970s, and that
this trend was consistent with trends in mean sea level (see also Lowe

and sea level rise to extrapolate future global mean sea level. These
alternative approaches yield projections of sea level rise under a range
of SRES scenarios by 2100 of 0.47 to 1.00 m (B1 to A2 scenarios; Horton

and 0.90 to 1.30 m (A1B scenario only; Grinsted et al., 2010). However,
future rates of sea level rise may be less closely associated with global
mean temperature if ice sheet dynamics play a larger role in the future
(Cazenave and Llovel, 2010). Furthermore, Church et al. (2011) note that
these models may overestimate future sea levels because non-climate
related contributions to trends over the observational period such as
groundwater depletion may not have been removed, and non-linear
effects such as the reduction in glacier area as glaciers contract and the
reduction in the efficiency of ocean heat uptake with global warming in
the future are not accounted for. Pfeffer et al. (2008), using a dynamical
model of glaciers, found that sea level rise of more than 2 m by 2100 is
physically implausible. An estimate of 0.8 m by 2100 that included
increased ice dynamics was considered most plausible.

"Various studies also highlight the aaaitional intiuence of climate
variability on extreme sea level trends. Menendez and Woodworth
(2010) report that ENSO (see Section 3.4.2) has a large influence on
interannual variations in extreme sea levels in the Pacific Ocean and
the monsoon regions based on sea level records since the 1970s. In
southern Europe, Marcos et al. (2009) report that changes in extremes
are also significantly negatively correlated with the NAO (see Section
3.4.3). Ullmann et al. (2007) concluded that maximum annual sea levels
in the Camargue had risen twice as fast as mean sea level during the
20th century due to an increase in southerly winds associated with a
general rise in sea level pressure over central Europe (Ullmann et al.,
2008). Sea level trends from two tide gauges on the north coast of
British Columbia from 1939 to 2003 were twice that of mean sea level
rise, the additional contribution being due to the strong positive phase
of the PDO (see Section 3.4.3), which has lasted since the mid-1970s
(Abeysirigunawardena and Walker, 2008). Cayan et al. (2008) reported
an increase of 20-fold at San Francisco since 1915 and 30-fold at La Jolla
since 1933 in the frequency of exceedance of the 99.99th percentile sea
level. They also noted that positive sea level anomalies of 10 to 20 cm
that often persisted for several months during El Nifio events produced
an increase in storm surge peaks over this time. The spatial extent of
these oscillations and their influence on extreme sea levels across the
Pacific has been discussed by Merrifield et al. (2007). Church et al.
(2006a) examined changes in extreme sea levels before and after 1950
in two tide gauge records of approximately 100 years on the east and
west coasts of Australia, respectively. At both locations a stronger
positive trend was found in the sea level exceeded by 0.01% of the
observations than the median sea level, suggesting that in addition to
mean sea level rise, other modes of variability or climate change are
contributing to the extremes. At Mar del Plata, Argentina, Fiore et al.

"Severe waves threaten the safety of coastal inhabitants and those

and marine infrastructure. Waves play a significant role in shaping a
coastline by transporting energy from remote areas of the ocean to the

longshore currents, and elevated coastal sea levels through wave set-up

statistically significant changes between 1961-1990 and 2071-2100
consisted of decreases in the 99th percentile surge heights south of
Iceland, and an 8 to 10% increase along the coastlines of the eastern
North Sea and the northwest British Isles, which occurred mainly in the

wintertime storm surges around Ireland except the south Irish coast

an AB scenario. Sterl et al. (2009) joined the output from an ensemble
of 17 GCM (CMIP3) simulations using the A1B emissions scenario over
the model periods 1950-2000 and 2050-2100 into a single longer time
series to estimate 10,000-year return values of surge heights along the
Dutch coastline. No statistically significant change in this value was
projected for the 21st century because projected wind speed changes
were not associated with the surge-generating northerlies but rather
non-surge generating south-westerlies.

"To summarize, post-AR4 studies provide additional evidence that
trends in extreme coastal high water across the globe reflect the
increases in mean sea level, suggesting that mean sea level rise
rather than changes in storminess are largely contributing to this
increase (although data are sparse in many regions and this lowers
the confidence in this assessment). It is therefore considered likely
that sea level rise has led to a change in extreme coastal high
water levels. It is /ikely that there has been an anthropogenic
influence on increasing extreme coastal high water levels via
mean sea level contributions. While changes in storminess
may contribute to changes in sea level extremes, the limited
geographical coverage of studies to date and the uncertainties
associated with storminess changes overall (Sections 3.4.4 and
3.4.5) mean that a general assessment of the effects of storminess
changes on storm surge is not possible at this time. On the basis
of studies of observed trends in extreme coastal high water
levels it is very likely that mean sea level rise will contribute to
upward trends in the future.

"The degree to which climate models (GCM or RCM) have sufficient
resolution and/or internal physics to realistically capture the meteorological
forcing responsible for storm surges is regionally dependent. For example
current GCMs are unable to realistically represent tropical cyclones (see
Section 3.4.4). This has led to the use of alternative approaches for
investigating the impact of climate change on storm surges in tropical
locations whereby large numbers of cyclones are generated using
statistical models that govern the cyclones’ characteristics over the
observed period (e.g., McInnes et al., 2003). These models are then
perturbed to represent projected future cyclone characteristics and used
to force a hydrodynamic model. Recent studies on the tropical east
coast of Australia reported in Harper et al. (2009) that employ these
approaches show a relatively small impact of a 10% increase in tropical
cyclone intensity on the 1-in-100 year storm tide (the combined sea level
due to the storm surge and tide), and mean sea level rise being found
to produce the larger contribution to changes in future 1-in-100 year
sea level extremes. However, one study that has incorporated scenarios
of sea level rise in the hydrodynamic modeling of hurricane-induced sea

2006 in the Gulf of Riga within the Baltic Sea, while the frequency and
intensity of high wave events (i.e., the difference between the maximum

Coral, and Tasman Seas (Trenberth et al., 2007), based on voluntary
observing ship data (e.g., Gulev and Grigorieva, 2004). Several studies
that address trends in extreme wave conditions have been completed
since the AR4 and the new studies generally provide more evidence for
the previously reported positive trends in SWH and extreme waves in
the north Atlantic and north Pacific. Global trends in 99th-percentile
satellite-measured wave heights show a mostly significant positive
trend of between 0.5 and 1.0% per year in the mid-latitude oceans but
less clear trends over the tropical oceans from 1985 to 2008 (Young et
al, 2011). X.L. Wang et al. (2009b) found that SWH increased in the
boreal winter over the past half century in the high latitudes of the
Northern Hemisphere (especially the northeast Atlantic), and decreased
in more southerly northern latitudes based on the European Centre for
Medium Range Weather Forecasts 40-year reanalysis (ERA-40). They
also found that storminess around the 1880s was of similar magnitude
to that in the 1990s. This is also found using the same data set by
Le Cozannet et al. (2011), who relate the change in waves to the NAO
pattern that is moderated by an east Atlantic pattern of climate variability
during winter. A wave hindcast over the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean
over the period 1953 to 2009 revealed a significant positive trend in
SWH, as well as a counterclockwise shift in mean direction in the north
and a slight but not significant increase in peak wave period in the
northeast. In the south, no trend was found for SWH or wave period
while a clockwise trend in mean direction was found (Dodet et al.,
2010). In a regional North Sea hindcast, Weisse and Giinther (2007)
found a positive trend in 99th-percentile wave height from 1958 to the
early 1990s followed by a declining trend to 2002 over the southern
North Sea, except on the UK North Sea coast where negative trends
occurred over much of the hindcast period.

"Severe coastal hazards such as erosion and inundation are important in
the context of disaster risk management and may be affected by climate
change through rising sea levels and changes in extreme events.
Increasing sea levels will also increase the potential for saltwater intrusion
into coastal aquifers. Coastal inundation occurs during periods of extreme
sea levels due to storm surges and high waves, particularly when
combined with high tides. Although tropical and extratropical cyclones
(Sections 3.4.4 and 3.4.5) are the most common causes of sea level
extremes, other weather events that cause persistent winds such as
anticyclones and fronts can also influence coastal sea levels (Green et
al., 2009; McInnes et al., 2009b). In many parts of the world, sea levels
are influenced by modes of large scale variability such as ENSO (Section
3.4.2). In the western equatorial Pacific, sea levels can fluctuate up to half
a meter between ENSO phases (Church et al., 2006b) and in combination
with extremes of the tidal cycle, can cause extensive inundation in low-
lying atoll nations even in the absence of extreme weather events
(Lowe et al., 2010).

"A number of regional studies have also been completed since the AR4
in which forcing conditions were obtained for a few selected emission
scenarios (typically B2 and A2, representing low-high ranges) from GCMs
or RCMs. These studies provide additional evidence for positive projected
trends in SWH and extreme waves along the western European coast
(e.g., Debernard and Roed, 2008; Grabemann and Weisse, 2008) and the
UK coast (Leake et al, 2007), declines in extreme wave height in the
Mediterranean sea (Lionello et al., 2008) and the southeast coast of
Australia (Hemer et al., 2010), and little change along the Portuguese
coast (Andrade et al., 2007). However, considerable variation in projections
can arise from the different climate models and scenarios used to force
wave models, which lowers the confidence in the projections. For example,
along the European North Sea coast, 99th-percentile wave height over
the late 21st century relative to the late 20th century is projected to
increase by 6 to 8% by Debernard and Roed (2008) based on wave
model simulations with forcing from several GCMs under A2, B2, and
A1B greenhouse gas scenarios, whereas they are projected to increase
by up to 18% by Grabemann and Weisse (2008), who downscaled two
GCMs under A2 and B2 emission scenarios. In one region, opposite
trends in extreme waves were projected. Grabemann and Weisse (2008)
project negative trends in 99th-percentile wave height along the UK
North Sea coast, whereas Leake et al. (2007) downscaled the same
GCM for the same emission scenarios, using a different RCM, and found
positive changes in high percentile wave heights offshore of the East
Anglia coastline. A wave projection study by Hemer et al. (2010)
concluded that uncertainties arising from the method by which climate
model winds were applied to wave model simulations (e.g., by applying
bias-correction to winds or perturbing current climate winds with wind
changes derived from climate models) made a larger contribution to the
spread of RCM projections than the forcing from different GCMs or
emission scenarios.

Coastlines have also evolved over this time frame due to changes in the

(Neill et al., 2009) and tides (Gehrels et al., 1995), which arise from the
changing geometries of coastlines over glacial time scales and changes

"The susceptibility of coastal regions to erosion and inundation is related
to various physical (e.g., shoreline slope), and geomorphological and
ecosystem attributes, and therefore may be inferred to some extent
from broad coastal characterizations. These include the presence of
beaches, rocky shorelines, or coasts with cliffs; deltas; back-barrier
environments such as estuaries and lagoons; the presence of mangroves,
salt marshes, or sea grasses; and shorelines flanked by coral reefs (e.g.,
Nicholls et al., 2007) or by permafrost or seasonal sea ice, each of which
are characterized by different vulnerability to climate change-driven
hazards. For example, deltas are low-lying and hence generally prone to
inundation, while beaches are comprised of loose particles and therefore
erodible. However, the degree to which these systems are impacted by
erosion and inundation will also be influenced by other factors affecting
disaster responses. For example, reduced protection from high waves
during severe storms could occur as a result of depleted mangrove
forests or the degradation of coral reefs (e.g., Gravelle and Mimura,
2008), or loss of sea ice or permafrost (e.g., Manson and Solomon, 2007);
there may be a loss of ecosystem services brought about by saltwater
contamination of already limited freshwater reserves due to rising sea
levels and these will amplify the risks brought about by climate change
(McGranahan et al., 2007), and also reduce the resilience of coastal
settlements to disasters. Dynamical processes such as vertical land
movement also contribute to inundation potential (Haigh et al., 2009).
Coastal regions may be rising or falling due to post-glacial rebound or
slumping due to aquifer drawdown (Syvitski et al., 2009). Multiple
contributions to coastal flooding such as heavy rainfall and flooding in
coastal catchments that coincide with elevated sea levels may also be
important. Ecosystems such as coral reefs also play an important role in
providing material on which atolls are formed. Large-scale oceanic
changes that are particularly relevant to both coral reefs and small
island countries are discussed in Box 3-4.

"attributing changes (e.g., Defeo et al., 2009). Since the AR4 there have
been several new studies that examine coastline changes. In the
Caribbean, the beach profiles at 200 sites across 113 beaches and eight
islands were monitored on a three-monthly basis from 1985 to 2000,
with most beaches found to be eroding and faster rates of erosion
generally found on islands that had been impacted by a higher number
of hurricanes (Cambers, 2009). However, the relative importance of
anthropogenic factors, climate variability, and climate change on the
eroding trends could not be separated quantitatively. In Australia,
Church et al. (2008) report that despite the positive trend in sea levels
during the 20th century, beaches have generally been free of chronic
coastal erosion, and where it has been observed it has not been possible
to unambiguously attribute it to sea level rise in the presence of other
anthropogenic activities. Webb and Kench (2010) argue that the
commonly held view of atoll nations being vulnerable to erosion must
be reconsidered in the context of physical adjustments to the entire
island shoreline, because erosion of some sectors may be balanced by
progradation on other sectors. In their survey of 27 atoll islands across
three central Pacific Nations (Tuvalu, Kiribati, and Federated States of
Micronesia) over a 19- to 61-year period using photography and
satellite imagery, they found that 43% of islands remained stable and
43% increased in area, with largest rates of increase in island area
ranging from 0.1 to 5.6 ha per decade. Only 14% of islands studied
exhibited a net reduction in area. On islands exhibiting either no net
change or an increase in area, a larger redistribution of land area was
evident in 65% of cases, consisting of mainly a shoreline recession on
the ocean side and an elongation of the island or progradation of the
shoreline on the lagoon side. Human settlements were present on 7 of
the 27 atolls surveyed and the majority of those exhibited net accretion
due in part to coastal protection works. For a coral reef island at the
northern end of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, Dawson and Smithers
(2010) report a 6% increase in area and 4% increase in volume between
1967 and 2007 but with a net retreat on the east-southeast shoreline
and advance on the western side. Chust et al. (2009) evaluated the
relative contribution of local anthropogenic (non-climate change related)
and sea level rise impacts on the coastal morphology and habitats in
the Basque coast, northern Spain, for the period 1954 to 2004. They
found that the impact from local anthropogenic influences was about
an order of magnitude greater than that due to sea level rise over this
period. Increased rates of coastal erosion have also been observed since
1935 in Canada’s Gulf of St. Lawrence (Forbes et al., 2004).

"Given the low elevation of many small islands, sea level extremes are of particular relevance. Sea level extremes are strongly influenced
by tidal extremes (Chowdhury et al., 2007; Merrifield et al., 2007). When the tide behavior is mostly semi-diurnal (two high and low tides
per day), there will be a clustering of high spring tides around the time of the equinoxes whereas when the tide behavior is diurnal (one
high and low tide per day), the clustering of high spring tides will occur around the time of the solstices. In addition, ENSO has a strong
influence such that sea levels and their extremes are positively (negatively) correlated with the SOI in the tropical Pacific west (east) of
180° (Church et al., 2006b; Menendez et al., 2010). Tides and ENSO have contributed to the more frequent occurrence of sea level
extremes and associated flooding experienced at some Pacific Islands such as Tuvalu in recent years, and make the task of determining
the relative roles of these natural effects and mean sea level rise difficult (Lowe et al., 2010). Furthermore, the steep shelf margins that
surround many islands and atolls in the Pacific support larger wave-induced contributions to sea level anomalies. Unfortunately, wave
observations (including wave direction) that would facilitate more comprehensive studies of tide, surge, and wave extremes in the region
are sparse, including those that are co-located with tide gauges (Lowe et al., 2010).

negative over the South Pacific region, and weakly negative over the Caribbean. Trends in heavy and very heavy precipitation were
positive over the Indian Ocean, negative over the South Pacific region, and close to zero over the Caribbean. We have /ow confidence in
temperature trends over the Indian Ocean and South Pacific region due to the shorter record over which trends were assessed,

whereas for the Caribbean, we have medium confidence in the temperature trends due to the longer records available for assessment.
Because of the spatial heterogeneity exhibited in precipitation trends in general, there is insufficient evidence to assess observed
rainfall trends. For the Caribbean, temperatures are projected to increase across the region by 1 to 4°C over 2071-2100 relative to
1961-1990 under the A2 and B2 scenarios and rainfall is mainly projected to decrease by 25 to 50% except in the north (Campbell et al.,
2011). Based on this study and the evidence for projected temperature increases reported for other regions (see Table 3-3) we have
medium confidence in the projected temperature increases for the Caribbean. However, due to the range of processes that contribute to
rainfall change, some of which are poorly resolved by GCMs, there is insufficient evidence to assess projected rainfall changes on these
small islands.

"Small island states represent a distinct category of locations owing to their small size and highly maritime climates, which means that
their concerns and information needs in relation to future climate change differ in many ways from those of the larger continental
regions that are addressed in this chapter. Their small land area and often low elevation makes them particularly vulnerable to rising sea
levels and impacts such as inundation, shoreline change, and saltwater intrusion into underground aquifers (Mimura, 1999). Their
maritime environments lead to an additional emphasis on oceanic information to understand the impacts of climate change (see Case
Study 9.2.9). Particular challenges exist for the assessment of past changes in climate given the sparse regional and temporal coverage
of terrestrial-based observation networks and the limited in situ ocean observing network, although observations have improved
somewhat in recent decades with the advent of satellite-based observations of meteorological and oceanic variables. However, the short
length of these records hampers the investigation of long-term trends in the region. The resolution of GCMs is insufficient to represent
small islands and few studies have been undertaken to provide projections for small islands using RCMs (Campbell et al., 2011). In
regions such as the Pacific Ocean, large-scale climate features such as the South Pacific Convergence Zone ENSO (Section 3.4.2) have a
substantial influence on the pattern and timing of precipitation, yet these features and processes are often poorly represented in GCMs
(Collins et al., 2010). The purpose of this box is to present available information on observed trends and climate change projections that
are not covered in the other sections of this chapter as well as discuss key aspects of the climate system that are particularly relevant for
small islands. The very likely contribution of mean sea level rise to increased extreme sea levels (see Section 3.5.3), coupled with the
likely increase in tropical cyclone maximum wind speed (see Section 3.4.4), is a specific issue for tropical small island states.

eastern coastlines were expected to be most sensitive to changes in
mean sea level, wave climate, and changes in storminess. A comparative
study of the impact of sea level rise on coastal inundation across 84
developing countries showed that the greatest vulnerability to a 1 m
sea level rise in terms of inundation of land area was located in East
Asia and the Pacific, followed by South Asia, Latin America, and the
Caribbean, the Middle East and North Africa, and finally sub-Saharan
Africa (Dasgupta et al., 2009).

"n summary, the small land area and often low elevation of small island states make them particularly vulnerable to rising
ea levels and impacts such as inundation, shoreline change, and saltwater intrusion into underground aquifers. Short
ecord lengths and the inadequate resolution of current climate models to represent small island states limit the assessment
of changes in extremes. There is insufficient evidence to assess observed trends and future projections in rainfall across the
small island regions considered here. The reported increases in warm days and nights and decreases in cold days and
lights are of medium confidence over the Caribbean and of low confidence over the Pacific and Indian Oceans. There is
nedium confidence in the projected temperature increases across the Caribbean. The unique situation of small islands
states and their maritime environments leads to an additional emphasis on oceanic information to understand the impacts
of climate change. The very likely contribution of mean sea level rise to increased coastal high water levels, coupled with
the likely increase in tropical cyclone maximum wind speed, is a specific issue for tropical small island states.

"Coral reefs are a feature of many small islands and healthy reef systems mitigate against erosion and inundation by not only providing a
buffer zone for the shoreline during extreme surge and wave events but also providing a source of carbonate sand and gravel, which are
delivered to the shores by storms and swell to maintain the atoll (Woodroffe, 2008; Webb and Kench, 2010). Anthropogenic oceanic
changes may indirectly contribute to extreme impacts for coral atolls by affecting the health of the surrounding reef system. Such
changes include: (1) warming of the surface ocean, which slows or prevents growth in temperature-sensitive species and causes more
frequent coral bleaching events (e.g., Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999; see also Chapter 4); (2) ocean acidification, caused by increases in
atmospheric CO, being absorbed into the oceans, which lowers coral growth rates (Bongaerts et al., 2010); and (3) reduction in oxygen
concentration in the ocean due to a combination of changes in temperature-driven gas solubility (Whitney et al., 2007), ocean ventilation
due to circulation changes, and biological cycling of organic material (Keeling et al., 2010). Quantifying these changes and understanding
their impact on coral reef health will be important to understanding the impact of anthropogenic climate change on atolls.

"Because of the diverse and complex nature of coastal impacts, assessments
of the future impacts of climate change have focused on a wide range
of questions and employed a diverse range of methods, making direct
comparison of studies difficult (R.J. Nicholls, 2010). Two types of studies
are examined here: the first are assessments, typically undertaken at the
country or regional scale and which combine information on physical
changes with the socioeconomic implications (e.g., Nicholls and de la
Vega-Leinert, 2008); the second type are studies oriented around improved
scientific understanding of the impacts of climate change. In terms of
coastal assessments, Aunan and Romstad (2008) reported that Norway’s
generally steep and resistant coastlines contribute to a low physical
susceptibility to accelerated sea level rise. Nicholls and de la Vega-Leinert
(2008) reported that large parts of the coasts in Great Britain (including
England, Wales, and Scotland) are already experiencing widespread
sediment starvation and erosion, loss/degradation of coastal ecosystems,
and significant exposure to coastal flooding. Lagoons, river deltas, and
estuaries are assessed as being particularly vulnerable in Poland (Pruszak
and Zawadzka, 2008). In Estonia, Kont et al. (2008) reported increased
beach erosion, which is believed to be the result of increased storminess
in the eastern Baltic Sea since 1954, combined with a decline in sea ice
cover during the winter. Sterr (2008) reported that for Germany there is

been a response to post-1970 warming” (Lemke et al., 2007). However,
the impacts of glacier retreat on the natural physical system in the
context of changes in extreme events were not assessed in detail.
Additionally, the AR4 did not assess geomorphological and geological
impacts that might result from anthropogenic climate change. The most
studied change in the high-mountain environment has been the retreat
of glaciers (Paul et al, 2004; Kaser et al., 2006; Larsen et al., 2007;
Rosenzweig et al., 2007). Alpine glaciers around the world were at
maximum extent by the end of the Little Ice Age (~1850), and have
retreated since then (Leclercq et al., 2011), with an accelerated decay
during the past several decades (Zemp et al., 2007). Most glaciers have
retreated since the mid-19th century (Francou et al., 2000; Cullen et al.,
2006; Thompson et al., 2006; Larsen et al., 2007; Schiefer et al., 2007; Paul
and Haeberli, 2008). Rates of retreat that exceed historical experience and
internal (natural) variability have become apparent since the beginning of
the 21st century (Reichert et al., 2002; Haeberli and Hohmann, 2008).

"Outburst floods from lakes dammed by glaciers or unstable moraines [or
‘glacial lake outburst floods’ (GLOFs)] are commonly a result of glacier
retreat and formation of lakes behind unstable natural dams (Clarke,
1982; Clague and Evans, 2000; Huggel et al., 2004; Dussaillant et al.,
2010). In the past century, GLOFs have caused disasters in many high-
mountain regions of the world (Rosenzweig et al., 2007), including the
Andes (Reynolds et al., 1998; Carey, 2005; Hegglin and Huggel, 2008),
the Caucasus and Central Asia (Narama et al., 2006; Aizen et al., 2007),

2005), and the European Alps (Haeberli, 1983; Haeberli et al., 2001;
Vincent et al., 2010). However, because GLOFs are relatively rare, it is
unclear whether their frequency of occurrence is changing at either the
regional or global scale. Clague and Evans (2000) argue that outburst
floods from moraine-dammed lakes in North America may have peaked
due to a reduction in the number of the lakes since the end of the Little
Ice Age. In contrast, a small but not statistically significant increase of
GLOF events was observed in the Himalayas over the period 1940 to
2000 (Richardson and Reynolds, 2000), but the event documentation
may not be complete. Over the past several decades, human mitigation
measures at unstable glacier lakes in the Himalaya and European Alps
may have prevented some potential GLOF events (Reynolds, 1998;

"and using a simple inundation model with high-resolution Light Detection

the impact of inundation on several coastal towns along the southeastern
Australian coastline under future sea level and wind speed scenarios.
Probabilistic approaches have also been used to evaluate extreme sea
level exceedance under uncertain future sea level rise scenarios. Purvis
et al. (2008) constructed a probability distribution around the range of
future sea level rise estimates and used Monte Carlo sampling to apply
the sea level change to a two-dimensional coastal inundation model.
They showed that by evaluating the possible flood-related losses in
this framework they were able to represent spatially the higher losses
associated with the low-frequency but high-impact inundation events
instead of considering only a single midrange scenario. Hunter (2010)
combined sea level extremes evaluated from observations with projections
of sea level rise to 2100 and showed, for example, that planning levels
in Sydney, Australia, would need to be increased substantially to cope
with increased risk of flooding. Along the Portuguese coast, Andrade et
al. (2007) found that projected future climate in the HadCM3 model
would not affect wave height along this coastline but the projected
rotation in wave direction would increase the net littoral drift and the
erosional response. Along a section of the southeast coast of the United
Kingdom, the effect of sea level rise, surge, and wave climate change on
the inshore wave climate was evaluated and the frequency and height
of extreme waves was projected to increase in the north of the domain
(Chini et al., 2010). On the basis of modeling the 25-year beach response
along a stretch of the Portuguese coast to various climate change
scenarios, Coelho et al. (2009) concluded that the projected stormier
wave climate led to higher rates of beach erosion than mean sea level
rise. Modeling of the evolution of soft rock shores with rising sea levels
has revealed a relatively simple relationship between sea level rise and
the equilibrium cliff profile (Walkden and Dickson, 2008).

significant change in debris flow frequency has been observed since the
1950s in terrain above elevations of 2,200 m (Jomelli et al., 2004).

"Debris flows from both glaciated and unglaciated volcanoes, termed
lahars, can be particularly large and hazardous. Lahars produced by
volcanic eruptions on the glacier-clad Nevado del Huila volcano in
Colombia in 2007 and 2008 were the largest rapid mass flows on Earth
in recent years. Similarly, large mass flows occur on ice-covered active
volcanoes in Iceland (Bjornsson, 2003), including Eyjafjallajokull in 2010.
Large rock and ice avalanches, with volumes up to 30 million m3, have
happened frequently (on average about one every four years) on the
glaciated Alaskan volcano, Iliamna, and are thought to be related to
elevated volcanic heat flow and possibly meteorological conditions
(Huggel et al., 2007). Glacier decay on active volcanoes can lead to a
reduction of lahar hazards due to less potential meltwater available for
lahar generation, but it is difficult to make a general conclusion as local
conditions also play important roles. In 1998, intense rainfall mobilized
pyroclastic material on the flanks of Vesuvius and Campi Flegrei
volcanoes, feeding approximately 150 debris flows that damaged nearby
communities and resulted in 160 fatalities (Bondi and Salvatori, 2003).

"A variety of climate and weather events can have geomorphological
and geological impacts. Warming and degradation of mountain
permafrost affect slope stability through a reduction in the shear
strength of ice-filled rock discontinuities. For example, the 2003
European summer heat wave (Section 3.3.1) caused rapid thaw and
thickening of the active layer, triggering a large number of mainly small
rock falls (Gruber et al., 2004; Gruber and Haeberli, 2007). Permafrost thaw
in sediment such as in talus slopes may increase both the frequency and
magnitude of debris flows (Zimmermann et al., 1997; Rist and Phillips,
2005). The frost table at the base of the active layer is a barrier to
groundwater infiltration and can cause the overlying non-frozen sediment
to become saturated. Snow cover can also affect debris flow activity by
supplying additional water to the soil, increasing pore water pressure
and initiating slope failure (Kim et al., 2004). Many of the largest debris
flows in the Alps in the past 20 years were triggered by intense rainfall
in summer or fall when the snowline was elevated (Rickenmann and
Zimmermann, 1993; Chiarle et al., 2007). Warming may increase the
flow speed of frozen bodies of sediment (Kaab et al., 2007; Delaloye et
al., 2008; Roer et al., 2008). Rock slopes can fail after they have been
steepened by glacial erosion or unloaded (debuttressed) following glacier
retreat (Augustinus, 1995). Although it may take centuries or even
longer for a slope to fail following glacier retreat, recent landslides
demonstrate that some slopes can respond to glacier down-wasting
within a few decades or less (Oppikofer et al., 2008). Twentieth-century
warming may have penetrated some decameters into thawing steep rock
slopes in high mountains (Haeberli et al., 1997). Case studies indicate that
both small and large slope failures can be triggered by exceptionally
warm periods of weeks to months prior to the events (Gruber et al.,
2004; Huggel, 2009; Fischer et al., 2011).

"The AR4 projected that glaciers in mountains will lose additional mass
over this century because more ice will be lost due to summer melting
than is replenished by winter precipitation (Meehl et al., 2007b). The
total area of glaciers in the European Alps may decrease by 20 to more
than 50% by 2050 (Zemp et al., 2006; Huss et al., 2008). The projected
glacier retreat in the 21st century may form new potentially unstable
lakes. Probable sites of new lakes have been identified for some alpine
glaciers (Frey et al., 2010). Rock slope and moraine failures may trigger
damaging surge waves and outburst floods from these lakes. The
temperature rise also will result in gradual degradation of mountain
permafrost (Haeberli and Burn, 2002; Harris et al., 2009). The zone of warm
permafrost (mean annual rock temperature approximately -2 to 0°C),
which is more susceptible to slope failures than cold permafrost, may

many regions are steeper, and therefore predisposed to failure. The
response of bedrock temperatures to surface warming through thermal
conduction will be slow, but warming will eventually penetrate to
considerable depths in steep rock slopes (Noetzli et al., 2007). Other heat
transport processes such as advection, however, may induce warming of
bedrock at much faster rates (Gruber and Haeberli, 2007). The response
of firn and ice temperatures to an increase in air temperature is faster
and nonlinear (Haeberli and Funk, 1991; Suter et al., 2001; Vincent et al.,
2007). Latent heat effects from refreezing meltwater can amplify the
increase in air temperature in firn and ice (Huggel, 2009; Hoelzle et al.,
2010). At higher temperatures, more ice melts and the strength of the
remaining ice is lower; as a result, the frequency and perhaps size of ice
avalanches may increase (Huggel et al., 2004; Caplan-Auerbach and
Huggel, 2007). Warm extremes can trigger large rock and ice avalanches

"Current low levels of seismicity in Antarctica and Greenland may be a
consequence of ice-sheet loading, and isostatic rebound associated
with accelerated deglaciation of these regions may result in an increase
in earthquake activity, perhaps on time scales as short as 10 to 100
years (Turpeinen et al., 2008; Hampel et al., 2010). Future ice mass loss
on glaciated volcanoes, notably in Iceland, Alaska, Kamchatka, the
Cascade Range in the northwest United States, and the Andes, could
lead to eruptions, either as a consequence of reduced load pressures on
magma chambers or through increased magma-water interaction.
Reduced ice load arising from future thinning of Iceland's Vatnajokull
Ice Cap is projected to result in an additional 1.4 km3 of magma
produced in the underlying mantle every century (Pagli and Sigmundsson,
2008). Ice unloading may also promote failure of shallow magma
reservoirs with a potential consequence of a small perturbation of the
natural eruptive cycle (Sigmundsson et al., 2010). Initially, ice thinning
of 100 m or more on volcanoes with glaciers more than 150-m thick,
such as Sollipulli in Chile, may cause more explosive eruptions, with
increased tephra hazards (Tuffen, 2010). Additionally, the potential for
edifice lateral collapse could be enhanced by loss of support previously
provided by ice (Tuffen, 2010) or to elevated pore-water pressures
arising from meltwater (Capra, 2006; Deeming et al., 2010). Ultimately
the loss of ice cover on glaciated volcanoes may reduce opportunities
for explosions arising from magma-ice interaction. The incidence of ice-
sourced lahars may also eventually fall, although exposure of new
surfaces of volcanic debris due to ice wastage may provide the raw
material for precipitation-related lahars. The likelihood of both volcanic
and non-volcanic landslides may also increase due to greater availability
of water, which could destabilize slopes. Many volcanoes provide a
ready source of unconsolidated debris that can be rapidly transformed
into potentially hazardous lahars by extreme precipitation events.
Volcanoes in coastal, near-coastal, or island locations in the tropics are
particularly susceptible to torrential rainfall associated with tropical
cyclones, and the rainfall rate associated with tropical cyclones is
projected to increase though the number of tropical cyclones is projected
to decrease or stay essentially unchanged (see Section 3.4.4). The impact
of future large explosive volcanic eruptions may also be exacerbated by an
"	Text
"rising air and rock temperatures (Gruber and Haeberli, 2007) or during
or following brief, anomalously warm events (Huggel et al., 2010) due
to meltwater infiltration and shear strength reduction. Debuttressing
effects due to glacier retreat can also destabilize or over-steepen slopes
(Tuffen, 2010). Furthermore, on volcanoes, geothermal heat flow can
enhance ice melting and thus create weak zones at the ice-bedrock
interface; and hydrothermal alteration of rocks can decrease the slope
stability (Huggel, 2009). On unglaciated high volcanoes in the Caribbean,
Central America, Europe, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Japan, an
increase in total rainfall or an increase in the frequency or magnitude of
severe rainstorms (see Section 3.3.2) could cause more frequent debris
flows by mobilizing unconsolidated, volcanic regolith and by raising pore-
water pressures, which could lead to deep-seated slope failure. Heavy
rainfall events could also influence the behavior of active volcanoes. For
example, Mastin (1994) attributes the violent venting of volcanic gases
at Mount St. Helens between 1989 and 1991 to slope instability or
accelerated growth of cooling fractures within the lava dome following
rainstorms, and Matthews et al. (2002) link episodes of intense tropical
rainfall with collapses of the Soufriere Hills lava dome on Montserrat in
the Caribbean. It is well established that ice mass wastage following the
end of the last glaciations led to increased levels of seismicity associated
with post-glacial rebound of the lithosphere (e.g., Muir-Wood, 2000;
Stewart et al., 2000). There has been a large reduction in glacier cover
in southern Alaska. Sauber and Molnia (2004) reported several hundred
meters vertical reduction. This ice reduction may be responsible for an
increase in seismicity in the region where earthquake faults are at the
threshold of failure (Sauber and Molnia, 2004; Doser et al., 2007). An
increase in the frequency of small earthquakes in the Icy Bay area, also
in southeast Alaska, is interpreted to be a crustal response to glacier
wastage between 2002 and 2006 (Sauber and Ruppert, 2008). Large-
scale ice mass loss in glaciated volcanic terrain reduces the load on the
crust and uppermost mantle, facilitating magma formation and its
ascent into the crust (Jull and McKenzie, 1996) and allowing magma to
reach the surface more easily (Sigmundsson et al., 2010). At the end of
the last glaciation, this mechanism resulted in a more than 10-fold
increase in the frequency of volcanic eruptions in Iceland (Sinton et al.,
2005).

the formation of uneven topography known as thermokarst, having
implications for ecosystems, landscape stability, and infrastructure

increase in permafrost temperature over the Arctic and subarctic, but
changes in snow cover also play a critical role (Osterkamp, 2005; Zhang,

snowfall in autumn and thicker snow cover during winter have resulted
in a stronger snow insulation effect, and as a result a much warmer
permafrost temperature than air temperature in the Arctic. On the other
hand, permafrost temperature may decrease even if air temperature
increases, if there is also a decrease in the duration and thickness of
snow cover (Taylor et al., 2006). The lengthening of the thaw season and
increases in summer air temperature have resulted in changes in active
layer thickness. Model simulations have projected thickening of the
active layer, a northward shift of the permafrost boundary, reductions
in permafrost area, and an increase in permafrost temperature in the

frozen in permafrost being released into the atmosphere, providing a

North American Arctic since the early 1990s (Shiklomanov et al., 2010).
However, over extreme warm summers, active layer thickness may
increase substantially (Smith et al, 2009), potentially triggering active-
layer detachment failures on slopes (Lewkowicz and Harris, 2005).
Extensive thermokarst development has been found in Alaska (Jorgenson
et al, 2006; Osterkamp et al., 2009), Canada (Vallée and Payette, 2007),
and central Yakutia (Gavriliev and Efremov, 2003). Increased rates of
retrogressive thaw slump activities have been reported on slopes over
the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (Niu et al., 2005) and adjacent to tundra
lakes over the Mackenzie Delta region of Canada (Lantz and Kokelj,
2008). Substantial expansion and deepening of thermokarst lakes was
observed near Yakutsk with subsidence rates of 17 to 24 cm yr! from
1992 to 2001 (Fedorov and Konstantinov, 2003). Satellite remote sensing
data show that thaw lake surface area has increased in continuous
permafrost regions and decreased in discontinuous permafrost regions
(Smith et al., 2005). Coasts with ice-bearing permafrost that are exposed
to the Arctic Ocean are very sensitive to permafrost degradation. Some
Arctic coasts are retreating at a rapid rate of 2 to 3 m yr! and the rate
of erosion along Alaska’s northeastern coastline has doubled over the
past 50 years, related to declining sea ice extent, increasing sea surface
temperature, rising sea level, thawing coastal permafrost, and possibly
increases in storminess and waves (Jones et al., 2009; Karl et al., 2009)

over high latitudes is primarily responsible for the development of
thermokarst terrains and thaw lakes.
"	Text
"In summary, it is likely that there has been warming of permafrost
in recent decades. There is high confidence that permafrost
temperatures will continue to increase, and that there will be
increases in active layer thickness and reductions in the area of
permafrost in the Arctic and subarctic.
"	Text
"In summary, there is low confidence in projecting future dust
storm changes, although an increase could be expected where
aridity increases. There is a lack of data and studies on past
changes. There is also a lack of understanding of processes such
as the relative importance of different climate variables affecting
dust storms, as well as a high uncertainty in simulating important
climate variables such as soil moisture, precipitation, and wind
that affect dust storms.
"	Text
"Future dust activity depends on two main factors: land use in the dust
source regions, and climate both in the dust source region and large-
scale circulation that affects long distance dust transport. Studies on
projected future dust activity are very limited. It is difficult to project
future land use. Precipitation, soil moisture, and runoff have been
projected to decrease in major dust source regions (Figure 10.12 in Meehl
et al., 2007b). Thomas et al. (2005) suggest that dune fields in southern
Africa can become active again, and sand will become significantly
exposed and move, as a consequence of 21st-century warming. A study
based on simulations from two climate models also suggests increased
desertification in arid and semi-arid China, especially in the second half
of the 21st century (X.M. Wang et al., 2009). However, confident projected
changes in wind are lacking (see Section 3.3.3).
"	Text
"The Sahara (especially the Bodélé Depression in Chad) and east Asia
have been recognized as the largest dust sources globally (Goudie,
2009). Over the few decades before the 1990s, the frequency of dust
events increased in some regions such as the Sahel zone of Africa
(Goudie and Middleton, 1992), and decreased in some other regions
such as China (Zhang et al., 2003). There seems to be an increase in more
recent years in China (Shao and Dong, 2006). Despite the importance of
African dust, studies on long-term change in Sahel dust are limited.
However, dust transported far away from the source region may provide
some evidence of long-term changes in the Sahel region. The African
dust transported to Barbados began to increase in the late 1960s and
through the 1970s; transported dust reached a peak in the early 1980s
but remains high into the present (Prospero and Lamb, 2003; Prospero
et al., 2009).
"	Text
"Sand and dust storms are widespread natural phenomena in many parts
of the world. Heavy dust storms disrupt human activities. Dust aerosols in
the atmosphere can cause a suite of health impacts including respiratory
problems (Small et al., 2001). The long-range transport of dust can
affect conditions at long distances from the dust sources, linking the
biogeochemical cycles of land, atmosphere, and ocean (Martin and
Gordon, 1988; Bergametti and Dulac, 1998; Kellogg and Griffin, 2006).
For example, dust from the Saharan region and from Asia may reach
North America and South America (McKendry et al, 2007). Some climate
models have representations of dust aerosols (Textor et al. 2006).
Climate variables that are most important to dust emission and transport
such as soil moisture (see also Section 3.5.1), precipitation, wind, and
vegetation cover are still subject to large uncertainties in climate model
simulations. As a result, the sand and dust storm simulations have large
uncertainties as well.
"	Text
"of dust storms is the surface wind associated with cold frontal systems
sweeping across arid and semi-arid regions and lifting soil particles in
the atmosphere. Dust emissions are also controlled by the surface
conditions in source regions such as the desert coverage distributions,
snow cover, and soil moisture. For example, in the Sahel region, the
elevated high level of dust emission prior to the 1990s was related to
the persistent drought during that time, and to long-term changes in the
NAO (Ginoux et al., 2004; Chiapello et al., 2005; Engelstaedter et al.,
2006), and perhaps to North Atlantic SST as well (Wong et al., 2008).
Further evidence of the importance of climate on dust emission is that
despite an increase of approximately 2 to 7% in desert areas in China
over the four decades since 1960, dust storm frequency decreased in
that period (Zhong, 1999). Studies on Asian soil dust production from
1960 to 2003 suggest that climatic variations have played a major role
in the declining trends in dust emission and storm frequencies in China
(Zhang et al., 2003; Zhou and Zhang, 2003; Zhao et al., 2004; Gong et
al., 2006). Overall, changes in dust activity are affected by changes in
the climate, such as wind and moisture conditions in the dust source
regions. Changes in large-scale circulation play an additional role in the
long-distance transport of dust. However, understanding of the physical
mechanisms of the long-term trends in dust activity is not complete; for
example, the relative importance of the various factors affecting dust
frequency as outlined above is uncertain.

"Settlement patterns, urbanization, and changes in socioeconomic conditions have all influenced observed
trends in exposure and vulnerability to climate extremes (high confidence). Settlements concentrate the
exposure of humans, their assets, and their activities. The most vulnerable populations include urban poor in informal
settlements, refugees, internally displaced people, and those living in marginal areas. Population growth is also a driv-
er of changing exposure and vulnerability. [4.2.1, 4.2.2, 4.3.5.1]

"Extreme impacts can result from extreme weather and climate events, but can also occur without extreme
events. This chapter examines two broad categories of impacts on human and ecological systems, both of which are
influenced by changes in climate, vulnerability, and exposure: first, the chapter primarily focuses on impacts that
result from extreme weather and climate events, and second, it also considers extreme impacts that are triggered by
less-than-extreme weather or climate events. These two categories of impacts are examined across sectors, systems,
and regions. Extreme events can have positive as well as negative impacts on ecosystems and human activities.

"Increasing exposure of people and economic assets has been the major cause of long-term increases in
economic losses from weather- and climate-related disasters (high confidence). Long-term trends in
economic disaster losses adjusted for wealth and population increases have not been attributed to climate
change, but a role for climate change has not been excluded (high agreement, medium evidence). These
conclusions are subject to a number of limitations in studies to date. Vulnerability is a key factor in disaster losses, yet
not well accounted. Other limitations are: (i) data availability, as most data are available for standard economic sec-
tors in developed countries; and (ii) type of hazards studied, as most studies focus on cyclones, where confidence in
observed trends and attribution of changes to human influence is /ow. The second conclusion is subject to additional
limitations: the processes used to adjust loss data over time, and record length. [4.5.3.3]
"	Text
"Economic, including insured, disaster losses associated with weather, climate, and geophysical events are
higher in developed countries. Fatality rates and economic losses expressed as a proportion of gross
domestic product (GDP) are higher in developing countries (high confidence). During the period from 1970 to
2008, over 95% of deaths from natural disasters occurred in developing countries. Middle-income countries with
rapidly expanding asset bases have borne the largest burden. During the period from 2001 to 2006, losses amounted
to about 1% of GDP for middle-income countries, while this ratio has been about 0.3% of GDP for low-income coun-
tries and less than 0.1% of GDP for high-income countries, based on limited evidence. In small exposed countries, par-
ticularly small island developing states, losses expressed as a percentage of GDP have been particularly high, exceed-
ing 1% in many cases and 8% in the most extreme cases, averaged over both disaster and non-disaster years for the

period from 1970 to 2010. [4.5.2, 4.5.4.1]
"	Text
"Economic losses from weather- and climate-related disasters have increased, but with large spatial and
interannual variability (high confidence, based on high agreement, medium evidence). Global weather- and
climate-related disaster losses reported over the last few decades reflect mainly monetized direct damages to assets,
and are unequally distributed. Estimates of annual losses have ranged since 1980 from a few US$ billion to above
200 billion (in 2010 dollars), with the highest value for 2005 (the year of Hurricane Katrina). In the period 2000 to
2008, Asia experienced the highest number of weather- and climate-related disasters. The Americas suffered the most
economic loss, accounting for the highest proportion (54.6%) of total loss, followed by Asia (27.5%) and Europe
(15.9%). Africa accounted for only 0.6% of global economic losses. Loss estimates are lower bound estimates because
many impacts, such as loss of human lives, cultural heritage, and ecosystem services, are difficult to value and monetize,
and thus they are poorly reflected in estimates of losses. Impacts on the informal or undocumented economy, as well
as indirect effects, can be very important in some areas and sectors, but are generally not counted in reported esti-
mates of losses. [4.5.1, 4.5.3.3, 4.5.4.1]

depend on future changes in tropical cyclone frequency and intensity (high confidence). Overall losses due to
extratropical cyclones will also increase, with possible decreases or no change in some areas (medium confidence).
Although future flood losses in many locations will increase in the absence of additional protection measures (high

scenarios used, and methods used to assess impacts on river flow and flood occurrence. [4.5.4.2]

"Coastal settlements in both developed and developing countries are exposed and vulnerable to climate
extremes. For example, the major factor increasing the vulnerability and exposure of North America to hurricanes is
the growth in population and increase in property values, particularly along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of the United
States. Small island states are particularly vulnerable to climate extremes, especially where urban centers and/or island
infrastructure predominate in coastal locations. Asia's mega-deltas are also exposed to extreme events such as flood-
ing and have vulnerable populations in expanding urban areas. Mountain settlements are also exposed and vulnerable
to climate extremes. [4.3.5.1, 4.4.3, 4.4.6, 4.4.9, 4.4.10]

"In many regions, the main drivers of future increases in economic losses due to some climate extremes will
be socioeconomic in nature (medium confidence, based on medium agreement, limited evidence). The
frequency and intensity of extreme weather and climate events are only one factor that affects risks, but few studies
have specifically quantified the effects of changes in population, exposure of people and assets, and vulnerability as
determinants of loss. However, these studies generally underline the important role of projected changes (increases) in
population and capital at risk. Additionally, some researchers argue that poorer developing countries and smaller
economies are more likely to suffer more from future disasters than developed countries, especially in relation to
extreme impacts. [4.5.2, 4.5.4.2]

specific changes at the catchment scale, there is high confidence that changes in climate have the potential to serious-
ly affect water management systems. However, climate change is in many instances only one of the drivers of future
changes in supply reliability, and is not necessarily the most important driver at the local scale. The impacts of changes
in flood characteristics are also highly dependent on how climate changes in the future, and as noted in Section 3.5.2,
there is low confidence in projected changes in flood magnitude or frequency. However, based on the available

high exposure and/or vulnerability). Where data are available, impacts
are examined from sectoral and regional perspectives. Throughout this

"Extreme impacts on humans and ecosystems can be conceptualized as
‘disasters’ or ‘emergencies.’ Many contemporary definitions emphasize
either that a disaster results when the impact is such that local capacity
to cope is exceeded or such that it severely disrupts normal activities.
There is a significant literature on the definitional issues, which include
factors of scale and irreversibility (Quarantelli, 1998; Handmer and
Dovers, 2007). Disasters result from impacts that require both exposure
to the climate event and a susceptibility to harm by what is exposed.
Impacts can include major destruction of assets and disruption to
economic sectors, loss of human lives, mental health effects, or loss and
impacts on plants, animals, and ecosystem services. The Glossary provides
the definition of disaster used in this chapter.

"Chapter 3 evaluates observed and projected changes in the frequency,
intensity, spatial extent, and duration of extreme weather and climate
events. This physical basis provides a picture of climate change and
extreme events. But it does not by itself indicate the impacts experienced
by humans or ecosystems. For example, for some sectors and groups of
people, severe impacts may result from relatively minor weather and
climate events. To understand impacts triggered by weather and climate
events, the exposure and vulnerability of humans and ecological systems
need to be examined. The emphasis of this chapter is on negative
impacts, in line with this report's focus on managing the risks of extreme
events and disasters. Weather and climate events, however, can and often
do have positive impacts for some people and ecosystems.

"Exposure can be conceptualized as the presence of human and ecosystem
tangible and intangible assets and activities (including services) in areas
affected by climate extremes (see Sections 1.1.2 and 2.2 and the
Glossary for definitional discussion). Without exposure there is no
impact. Temporal and spatial scales are also important. Exposure can be
more or less permanent; for example, exposure can be increased by
people visiting an area or decreased by evacuation of people and
livestock after a warning. As human activity and settlements expand
into an exposed area, more people will be subject to and affected by
local climatic hazards. Population growth is predominantly in developing
countries (Peduzzi et al, 2011; UNISDR, 2011). Newly occupied areas
around or in urban areas were previously left vacant because they are
prone to the occurrence of climatic hazards (Handmer and Dovers,
2007; Satterthwaite et al., 2007; Wilbanks et al., 2007), for example with
movement of squatters to and development of informal settlements in
areas prone to flooding (Huq et al, 2007) and landslides (Anderson et
al., 2007). ‘Informal settlements’ are characterized by an absence of
involvement by government in planning, building, or infrastructure and
lack of secure tenure. In addition, there are affluent individuals pursuing
environmental amenity through coastal canal estates, riverside, and
bush locations, which are often at greater risk from floods and fires

"Refugees, internally displaced people, and those driven into marginal
areas as a result of violence can be dramatic examples of people
vulnerable to the negative effects of weather and climate events, cut off
from coping mechanisms and support networks (Handmer and Dovers,

include destruction or abandonment of infrastructure (e.g., transport,
communications, health, and education) and shelter, redirection of
resources from social to military purposes, collapse of trade and
commerce, abandonment of subsistence farmlands, lawlessness, and
disruption of social networks (Levy and Sidel, 2000; Collier et al., 2003).
The proliferation of weapons and minefields, the absence of basic
health and education, and collapse of livelihoods can ensure that the
effects of war on vulnerability to disasters are long lasting, although
some also benefit (Korf, 2004). These areas are also characterized by an
exodus of trained people and an absence of inward investment.

"Economic development and land use change can also lead to changes
in natural systems. Land cover changes induce changes in rainfall-runoff
patterns, which can impact on flood intensity and frequency (eg.,
Kundzewicz and Schellnhuber, 2004). Deforestation, urbanization,
reduction of wetlands, and river regulation (e.g., channel straightening,
shortening, and embankments) change the percentage of precipitation
becoming runoff by reducing the available water storage capacity (Few,
2003; Douglas et al., 2008). The proportion of impervious areas (e.g.,
roofs, yards, roads, pavements, parking lots, etc.) and the value of the
runoff coefficient are increased. As a result, water runs off faster to
rivers or the sea, and the flow hydrograph has a higher peak and a
shorter time-to-peak (Cheng and Wang, 2002; Few, 2003; Douglas et al.,
2008), reducing the time available for warnings and emergency action.
In mountainous areas, developments extending into hilly slopes are
potentially endangered by landslides and debris flows triggered by
intense rains. These changes have resulted in rain that is less extreme
leading to serious impacts (Crozier, 2010).

"Changes in socioeconomic status are a key component of exposure; in
particular, population growth is a major driver behind changing exposure
and vulnerability (Downton et al., 2005; Barredo, 2009). In many
regions, people have been encroaching into flood-prone areas where
effective flood protection is not assured, due to human pressure and lack
of more suitable and available land (McGranahan et al., 2007; Douglas
et al., 2008). Urbanization, often driven by rural poverty, drives such
migration (Douglas et al., 2008). In these areas, both population and
wealth are accumulating, thereby increasing the flood damage potential.
In many developed countries, population and wealth accumulation also
occur in hazard-prone areas for reasons of lifestyle and/or lower cost
(eg., Radeloff et al, 2005). Here, a tension between climate change
adaptation and development is seen; living in these areas without
appropriate adaptation may be maladaptive from a climate change
perspective, but this may be a risk people are willing to take, or a risk
over which they have limited choice, considering their economic
circumstances (Wisner et al., 2004). Furthermore, there is often a
deficient risk perception present, stemming from an unjustified faith in
the level of safety provided by flood protection systems and dikes in
particular (Grothmann and Patt, 2005) (e.g., 2005 Hurricane Katrina in
New Orleans).

incurred. Levels of physical and mental health also affected people’s vulnerability. Many individuals with ongoing medical conditions,
special needs because of their age, or other impairments struggled to cope with the extreme heat and were reliant on others to respond
safely (Handmer et al., 2010). However, capacity to recover in a general sense was high for humans and human activities through
insurance, government support, private donations, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and was variable for the affected bush

four factors that may individually or together explain this increase: improved access to information, higher population exposure, higher
vulnerability, and higher frequency and/or intensity of hazards (Dao and Peduzzi, 2004; Peduzzi et al., 2009). Due to uncertainties in the
significance of the role of each of these four possible factors (especially regarding improved access to information), a vulnerability and

difficult to estimate future flood hazards. However, using population increase in the flood-prone area, it is possible to look at trends in

regional recharge, because domestic supply requires only 3-10 mm of
recharge per year. However, they noted that up to 90 million people in
low rainfall areas (200-500 mm) would be at risk if rainfall reduces to
the point at which groundwater resources become nonrenewable.

"Extreme events considered in this section can threaten the ability of the
water supply ‘system’ (from highly managed systems with multiple
sources to a single rural well) to supply water to users. This may be
because a surplus of water affects the operation of systems, but more
typically results from a shortage of water relative to demands — a
drought. Water supply shortages may be triggered by a shortage of river
flows and groundwater, deterioration in water quality, an increase in
demand, or an increase in vulnerability to water shortage. There is
medium confidence that since the 1950s some regions of the world
have experienced more intense and longer droughts, in particular in
southern Europe and West Africa (see Section 3.5.1), but it is not possible
to attribute trends in the human impact of drought directly or just to
these climatic trends because of the simultaneous change in the other
drivers of drought impact.

"Few studies have so far been published on the effect of climate change
on the impacts of drought in water resources terms at the local catchment
scale. Virtually all of these have looked at water system supply reliability
during a drought, or the change in the yield expected with a given
reliability, rather than indicators such as lost production, cost, or well-
being. Changes in the reliability of a given yield, or yield with a given
reliability, of course vary with local hydrological and water management
circumstances, the details of the climate scenarios used, and other
drivers of drought risk. Some studies show large potential reductions in
supply reliability due to climate change that challenge existing water
management systems (e.g., Fowler et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2009; Takara
et al., 2009; Vanham et al., 2009); some show relatively small reductions

"There is medium confidence that the projected duration and intensity of
hydrological drought will increase in some regions with climate change
(Section 3.5.1), but other factors leading to a reduction in river flows or
groundwater recharge are changes in agricultural land cover and
upstream interventions. A deterioration in water quality may be driven
by climate change (as shown for example by Delpla et al., 2009;
Whitehead et al., 2009; Park et al., 2010), change in land cover, or
upstream human interventions. An increase in demand may be driven by
demographic, economic, technological, or cultural drivers as well as by
climate change (see Section 2.5). An increase in vulnerability to water
shortage may be caused, for example, by increasing reliance on specific
sources or volumes of supply, or changes in the availability of alternatives.
Indicators of hydrological and water resources drought impact include
lost production (of irrigated crops, industrial products, and energy), the
cost of alternative or replacement water sources, and altered human
well-being, alongside consequences for freshwater ecosystems (impacts
of meteorological and agricultural droughts on production of rain-fed

"There have been several continental- or global-scale assessments of
potential change in hydrometeorological drought indicators (see
Section 3.5.1), but relatively few on measures of water resources
drought or drought impacts. This is because these impacts are very
dependent on context. One published large-scale assessment (Lehner et
al., 2006) used a generalized drought deficit volume indicator, calculated
by comparing simulated river flows with estimated withdrawals for
municipal, industrial, and agricultural uses. The indicator was calculated
across Europe, using climate change projections from two climate
models and assuming changes in withdrawals over time. They showed
substantial changes in the return period of the drought deficit volume,
comparing the 100-year return period for the 1961-1990 period with
projections for the 2070s (Figure 4-3). Across large parts of Europe, the
1961-1990 100-year drought deficit volume is projected to have a
return period of less than 10 years by the 2070s. Lehner et al. (2006)
also demonstrated that this projected pattern of change was generally
driven by changes in climate, rather than the projected changes in
withdrawals of water (Figure 4-3). In southern and western Europe,
changing withdrawals alone only are projected to increase deficit
volumes by less than 5%, whereas the combined effect of changing
withdrawals and climate change is projected to increase deficit volumes
by at least 10%, and frequently by more than 25%. In eastern Europe,
increasing withdrawals are projected to increase drought deficit
volumes by over 5%, and more than 10% across large areas, but this is
offset under both climate scenarios by increasing runoff.

gaps and overall contraction of the distribution range for species

Wascher, 2004). Fischlin et al. (2007), from assessment of 19 studies,
found that 20 to 30% of studied plant and animal species may be at an
increased risk of extinction if warming exceeds 2 to 3°C above the
preindustrial level. Changes due to climate extremes could also entail
shifts of ecosystems to less-desired states (Scheffer et al, 2001; Chapin

critical temperature thresholds, with potential loss of ecosystem services

by inducing drought that suppresses net primary productivity. More
frequent warm years may lead to a sustained decrease in CO, uptake by
terrestrial ecosystems (Arnone et al., 2008). Extreme temperature

being a net carbon source. For example, tall-grass prairie net ecosystem

Oklahoma, United States (Arnone et al., 2008). A 30% reduction in gross

"At the global scale, two studies have estimated the numbers of people
affected by increases (or decreases) in flood hazard. Kleinen and Petschel-
Held (2007) calculated the percentage of population living in river basins
where the return period of the current 50-year event becomes shorter,
for three climate models and a range of increases in global mean
temperature. With an increase in global mean temperature of 2°C (above
late 20th-century temperatures), between (approximately) 5 and 27%
of the world’s population would live in river basins where the current
50-year return period flood occurs at least twice as frequently. Hirabayashi
and Kanae (2009) used a different metric, counting each year the number
of people living in grid cells where the flood peak exceeded the (current)
100-year magnitude, using runoff as simulated by a high-resolution
climate model fed through a river routing model. Beyond 2060, they
found that at least 300 million people could be affected by substantial
flooding even in years with relatively low flooding, with of the order of
twice as many being flooded in flood-rich years (note that they used
only one climate scenario with one climate model). This compares with
a current range (using the same index) of between 20 and 300 million
people. The largest part of the projected increase is due to increases in
the occurrence of floods, rather than increases in population.

"events in two regions of England, combining fluvial and coastal flooding.
The two main conclusions from their work were as follows. First, the
percentage change in cost was greater for the rarer event than the more
frequent event. Second, the absolute value of impacts, and therefore the
percentage change from current impacts, was found to be highly
dependent on the assumed socioeconomic change. In one region, event
damage varied, in monetary terms, between four and five times across
socioeconomic scenarios. An even wider range in estimated average
annual damage was found in the UK Foresight Future Flooding and
Coastal Defence project (Evans et al., 2004; Hall et al., 2005), which
calculated average annual damage in 2080 of £1.5 billion, £5 billion, and
£21 billion under similar climate scenarios but different socioeconomic
futures (current average annual damage was estimated at £1 billion).
The Foresight project represented the effect of climate change on flood
frequency by altering the shape of the flood frequency curve using
precipitation outputs from climate models and rainfall-runoff models for
a sample of UK catchments. The EU-funded Projection of Economic
impacts of climate change in Sectors of the European Union based on
boTtom-up Analysis (PESETA) project (Ciscar, 2009; Feyen et al., 2009)
used a hydrological model to simulate river flows, flooded areas, and flood
frequency curves from climate scenarios derived from regional climate
models, but — in contrast to the UK Foresight project — assumed no
change in economic development in flood-prone areas. Figure 4-4
summarizes estimated changes in the average annual number of people
flooded and average annual damage, by European region (Ciscar, 2009).
There are strong regional variations in impact, with particularly large
projected increases in both number of people flooded and economic
damage (over 200%) in central and Eastern Europe, while in parts of
North Eastern Europe, average annual flood damages decrease.

crown layer, while deciduous species survived. Similarly, Abies Koreana,
an endemic species in Korea, at high elevation has declined following a

Water supply for agricultural production will be critical to sustain

glaciers retreating due to global warming and El Nifio episodes, the
Andean region faces increasing threats to its water supply (Mark and
Seltzer, 2003; Cadier et al., 2007). With precipitation limited to only a few
months of the year, melt from glaciers is the only significant source of
water during the dry season (Mark and Seltzer, 2003). Glacier recession
reduces the buffering role of glaciers, hence inducing more floods during
the rainy season and more water shortages during the dry season.

"Evidence that the current warming trends around the world have
already begun to impact agriculture is reported by Lobell et al. (2011). They

temperature effects on crops in the United States and Africa, concluded
that climate change would have negative impacts on crop yields. These
effects were based on temperature trends and an expected increase in
the probability of extremes during the growing season; however, there
is also the potential occurrence of extreme events after the crop is
grown, which could affect harvest and grain quality. Fallon and Betts
(2010) stated that increasing flooding and drought risks could affect
agricultural production and require the adoption of robust management
practices to offset these negative impacts. Their analysis for Europe

1996; Prasad et al., 2006). For example, Tian et al. (2010) observed in rice
that high temperatures (>35°C) coupled with high humidity and low
wind speed caused panicle temperatures to be as much as 4°C higher
than air temperature, inducing floret sterility. Impacts of temperature
extremes may not be limited to daytime events. Mohammed and Tarpley
(2009) observed that rice yields were reduced by 90% when night
temperatures were increased from 27 to 32°C. An additional impact of
extremes has been found in the quality of the grain. Kettlewell et al.
(1999) found that wheat quality in the United Kingdom was related to
the North Atlantic Oscillation and probably caused by variation in
rainfall during the grain-filling period. In a more recent study, Hurkman
et al. (2009) observed that high-temperature events during grain-filling
of wheat altered the protein content of the grain, and these responses
were dependent upon whether the exposure was imposed early or
midway through the grain-filling period. Skylas et al. (2002) observed that
high temperature during grain-filling was one of the most significant
factors affecting both yield and flour quality in wheat.

temperature drop at night (e.g., see Case Study 9.2.1). This is the urban
heat island effect resulting from the large amount of heat-absorbing
material, building characteristics, and emissions of anthropogenic heat
from air conditioning units and vehicles (e.g., Rizwan et al., 2008; for a
critical review of heat island research, see Stewart, 2011). Heat waves
combined with urban heat islands (Basara et al., 2010; Tan et al., 2010)
can result in large death tolls with the elderly, the unwell, the socially
isolated, and outdoor workers (Maloney and Forbes, 2011) being
especially vulnerable, although acclimatization and heat health-warning
systems can substantially reduce excess deaths (Fouillet et al., 2008).
Heat waves thus pose a future challenge for major cities (e.g., Endlicher

"Urbanization exacerbates the negative effects of flooding through
greatly increased runoff concentration, peak, and volume, the increased
occupation of flood plains, and often inadequate drainage planning
(McGranahan et al., 2007; Douglas et al., 2008). These urbanization
issues are universal but often at their worst in informal settlements,
which are generally the most exposed to flooding and usually do not
have the capacity to deal with the issues (Hardoy et al., 2001). Flooding
regularly disrupts cities, and urban food production can be severely
affected by flooding, undermining local food security in poor communities
(Douglas, 2009; Aggarwal and Singh, 2010). A further concern for low-
and middle-income cities as a result of flooding, particularly in developing
countries, is human waste, as most of these cities are not served by
proper water services such as sewers, drains, or solid waste collection
services (Hardoy et al., 2001).

"The largest impacts from coastal inundation due to sea level rise (and/or
relative sea level rise) in low-elevation coastal zones (i.¢., coastal areas
with an elevation less than 10 m above present mean sea level; see
McGranahan et al., 2007) are thought to be associated with extreme
sea levels due to tropical and extratropical storms (e.g., Ebersole et al.,
2010; Mozumder et al., 2011) that will be superimposed upon the long-
term sea level rise (e.g., Frazier et al., 2010). An increase in the mean
maximum wind speed of tropical cyclones is likely over the 21st century,
but possibly not in all ocean basins (see Table 3-1). The destructive
potential of tropical cyclones may increase in some regions as a result
of this projected increase in intensity of mean maximum wind speed
and tropical cyclone-related rainfall rates (see Section 3.4.4). Storms
generally result in considerable disruption and local destruction, but
cyclones and their associated storm surges have in some cases caused
very substantial destruction in modern cities (e.g., New Orleans and
Darwin; see also Case Study 9.2.5). The impacts are considered to be
more severe for large urban centers built on deltas and small island
states (McGranahan et al., 2007; Love et al., 2010; Wardekker et al.,
2010), particularly for those at the low end of the international income
distribution (Dasgupta et al., 2009). The details of exposure will be
controlled by the natural or human-induced characteristics of the system,
for example, the occurrence/distribution of protecting barrier islands
and/or coastal wetlands that may attenuate surges (see, e.g., Irish et al.,
2010; Wamsley et al., 2010) or changes such as land reclamation (Guo
et al., 2009). Recent studies (Nicholls et al., 2008; Hanson et al., 2011)
have assessed the asset exposure of port cities with more than one
million inhabitants (in 2005). They demonstrated that large populations
are already exposed to coastal inundation (~40 million people or 0.6%
of the global population) by a 1-in-100-year extreme event, while the
total value of exposed assets was estimated at US$ 3,000 billion (~ 5%
of the global GDP in 2005). By the 2070s, population exposure was
estimated to triple, whereas asset exposure could grow tenfold to some
US$ 35,000 billion; these estimates, however, do not account for the
potential construction of effective coastal protection schemes (see also
Dawson et al., 2005), with the exposure growth rate being more rapid in
developing countries (e.g., Adamo, 2010). Lenton et al. (2009) estimated a
substantial increase in the exposure of coastal populations to inundation
(see Figure 4-5).

road surfaces (Meizhu et al., 2010). Extreme temperature may cause
expansion and increased movement of concrete joints, protective
cladding, coatings, and sealants on bridges and airport infrastructure,
impose stresses in the steel in bridges, and disrupt rail travel (e.g., Arkell

of extreme events on biodiversity and landscape change (e.g., coastal

tourism destinations; and (3) tourism-adverse perception of particular
touristic regions after occurrence of the extreme event itself. For example,
adverse weather conditions or the occurrence of an extreme event can

Often overshadowed by the physical health outcomes of an event, the
psychological effects can be long lasting and can affect a large portion of
a population (Morrissey and Reser, 2007). An extreme event may affect
mental health directly from acute traumatic stress from an event, with
common outcomes of anxiety and depression. It can also have indirect
impacts during the recovery period associated with the stress and
challenges of loss, disruption, and displacement. Furthermore, indirect
mental health impacts could even affect individuals not directly associated
with an event, like grieving friends and family of those who die from an
event or the rescue and aid workers who suffer post-traumatic stress

are not often adequately monitored, but the body of research conducted
after natural disasters in the past three decades suggests that the burden

drought-sensitive population, whereas 69% of the population experiences
relative water abundance (Vordsmarty et al., 2005). Even for this latter
part of the population, however, relative abundance does not necessarily
correspond to access to safe drinking water and sanitation, and this
effective reduction of the quantity of freshwater available for human use

four types of floods: flash floods from the overflowing of hilly rivers; rain
floods due to poor drainage; monsoon floods in the flood plains of
major rivers; and coastal floods following storm surge. In a normal year,
river spills and drainage congestions cause inundation of 20 to 25% of

Economic losses from flood hazards in Europe have increased considerably
over previous decades (Lugeri et al, 2010), and increasing exposure of
people and economic assets is probably the major cause of the long-
term changes in economic disaster losses (Barredo, 2009). Exposure is
influenced by socioeconomic development, urbanization, and infrastructure

by a few individual flood events (e.g., the 1997 floods in Poland and
Czech Republic, the 2002 floods in much of Europe, and the 2007 summer
floods in the United Kingdom). The projected increase in frequency and
intensity of heavy precipitation over large parts of Europe (Table 3-3) may
increase the probability of flash floods, which pose the highest risk of
fatality (EEA, 2004). Particularly vulnerable are new urban developments
and tourist facilities, such as camping and recreation areas (e.g., a large
flash flood in 1996 in the Spanish Pyrenees, conveying a large amount

"Beyond direct destruction of property, flooding has important negative
impacts on a variety of economic sectors including transportation and
agriculture. Heavy precipitation and field flooding in agricultural systems
delays spring planting, increases soil compaction, and causes crop losses
through anoxia and root diseases; variation in precipitation is responsible
for the majority of the crop losses (Mendelsohn, 2007). In 1993, heavy
precipitation flooded 8.2 million acres (~3.3 million ha) of American
Midwest soybean and corn fields, leading to a 50% decrease in corn yields
in lowa, Minnesota, and Missouri, and a 20 to 30% decrease in Illinois,
Indiana, and Wisconsin (Changnon, 1996). Furthermore, flood impacts
include temporary damage or permanent destruction of infrastructure
for most modes of transportation (Zimmerman and Faris, 2010). For
example, heavy precipitation events are a very costly weather condition
facing US rail transportation (Changnon, 2006).

for all emission scenarios, including demographic change (McMichael et

occur per year in people aged over 65, but this number is projected to
rise approximately two-, three-, and six-fold for warming of 1, 2, and 3°C,
respectively (McMichael et al., 2003b). An aging society in Australia and
New Zealand would amplify these figures. For example, it has been

"North America is exposed to coastal storms, and in particular, hurricanes.
2005 was a particularly severe year with 14 hurricanes (out of 27 named
storms) in the Atlantic (NCDC, 2005). There were more than 2,000 deaths
during 2005 (Karl et al., 2009) and widespread destruction on the Gulf
Coast and in New Orleans in particular. Property damages exceeded
US$ 100 billion (Beven et al., 2008; Pielke Jr. et al., 2008). Hurricanes
Katrina and Rita destroyed more than 100 oil and gas platforms in the
Gulf and damaged 558 pipelines, halted all oil and gas production in the
Gulf, and disrupted 20% of US refining capacity (Karl et al., 2009). It is
reported that the direct overall losses of Hurricane Katrina were about
US$ 138 billion in 2007 dollars (Spranger, 2008). However, 2005 may be
an outlier for a variety of reasons — the year saw storms of higher than
average frequency, with greater than average intensity, which made
more frequent landfall, including in the most vulnerable region of the
country (Nordhaus, 2010). The major factor increasing the vulnerability
and exposure of North America to hurricanes is the growth in population
(see, e.g., Pielke Jr. et al., 2008) and increase in property values, particularly
along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of the United States. While some of
this increase has been offset by adaptation and improved building
codes, Nordhaus (2010) suggests the ratio of hurricane damages to
national GDP has increased by 1.5% per year over the past half-century.
However, the choice of start and end dates influences this figure.

"The ocean’s huge mass in comparison to the atmosphere gives it a crucial
role in global heat budgets and chemical budgets. Possible extreme
impacts can be triggered by (1) warming of the surface ocean, with a
major cascade of physical effects, (2) ocean acidification induced by
increases in atmospheric CO}, and (3) reduction in oxygen concentration
in the ocean due to a temperature-driven change in gas solubility and
physical impacts from (1). All have potentially nonlinear multiplicative
impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem function, and each may increase
the vulnerability of ocean systems, triggering an extreme impact
(Kaplan et al., 2010; Griffith et al, 2011). Surface warming of the oceans
can itself directly impact biodiversity by slowing or preventing growth in
temperature-sensitive species. One of the most well-known biological
impacts of warming is coral bleaching, but ocean acidification can also
affect coral growth rates (Bongaerts et al., 2010). The seasonal sea ice
cycle affects biological habitats. Such species of Arctic mammals as
polar bears, seals, and walruses depend on sea ice for habitat, hunting,
feeding, and breeding. Declining sea ice can decrease polar bear numbers

economic assets or stocks, as well as consequential indirect effects on
economic flows, such as on GDP or consumption. In line with general
definitions in Chapters 1 and 2, economic disaster risk may be defined
as a probability distribution indicating potential economic damage costs
and associated return periods. The cost categories of direct, indirect, and
intangible are rarely fully exclusive, and items or activities can have
elements in all categories.

"The economic costs associated with climate extremes and disasters can be
subdivided into impact or damage costs (or simply losses) and adaptation
costs. Costs arise due to economic, social, and environmental impacts of
a climate extreme or disaster and adaptation to those impacts in key
sectors. Residual damage costs are the impact and damage costs after
all desirable and practical adaptation actions have been implemented.
Conceptually, comparing costs of adaptation with damages before
adaptation and residual damages can help in assessing the economic
efficiency of adaptation (Parry et al., 2009).

adaptation. The section stands at the interface between chapters, using
the conceptual framework of Chapters 1 and 2 and the scientific
foundation of Chapter 3 and earlier subsections in this chapter, and
leading into the following Chapters 5 through 9.

"Direct damage costs or losses are often defined as those that are a
direct consequence of the weather or climate event (eg., floods,
windstorms, or droughts). They refer to the costing of the physical
impacts of climate extremes and disasters — on the lives and health of
directly affected persons; on all types of tangible assets, including
private dwellings, and agricultural, commercial, and industrial stocks and
facilities; on infrastructure (e.g., transport facilities such as roads, bridges,
and ports, energy and water supply lines, and telecommunications); on
public facilities (e.g., hospitals, schools); and on natural resources
(ECLAC, 2003; World Bank, 2010).
"	Text
"Indirect impact costs generally arise due to the disruption of the flows
of goods and services (and therefore economic activity) because of a
disaster, and are sometimes termed consequential or secondary impacts
as the losses typically flow from the direct impact of a climate event
(ECLAC, 2003; World Bank, 2010). Indirect damages may be caused by
the direct damages to physical infrastructure or sources of livelihoods,
or because reconstruction pulls resources away from production.
Indirect damages include additional costs incurred from the need to use
alternative and potentially inferior means of production and/or distribution
of normal goods and services (Cavallo and Noy, 2010). For example,
electricity transmission lines may be destroyed by wind, a direct impact,
causing a key source of employment to cease operation, putting many
people out of work, and in turn creating other problems that can be
classified as indirect impacts. These impacts can emerge later in the
affected location, as well as outside the directly affected location (Pelling
et al, 2002; ECLAC, 2003; Cavallo and Noy, 2010). Indirect impacts
include both negative and positive factors — for example, transport
disruption, mental illness or bereavement resulting from disaster shock,
rehabilitation, health costs, and reconstruction and disaster-proof
investment, which can include changes in employment in a disaster-hit
area (due to reconstruction and other recovery activity) or additional
demand for goods produced outside of a disaster-affected area (ECLAC,
2003; World Bank, 2010). As another example, long-running droughts
can induce indirect losses such as local economic decline, out-migration,
famine, the partial collapse of irrigation areas, or loss of livelihoods
dependent on hydroelectricity or rain-fed agriculture. It is important to
note that impacts on the informal or undocumented economy may be
very important in some areas and sectors, but are generally not counted
in reported estimates of losses.

adaptation measures (including transition costs) (Smit et al., 2001; also

as the value of avoided impacts and damages as well as the co-benefits
generated by the implementation of adaptation measures (Smit et al.,
2001). The value of all avoidable damage can be taken as the gross (or
theoretically maximum) benefit of adaptation and risk management,
which may be feasible to adapt to but not necessarily economically efficient
(Pearce et al., 1996; Tol, 2001; Parry et al., 2009). The adaptation deficit
is identified as the gap between current and optimal levels of adaptation
to climate change (Burton and May, 2004). However, it is difficult to
assess the optimal adaptation level due to the uncertainties inherent in
climate scenarios, the future patterns of exposure and vulnerability to
climate events, and debates over methodological issues such as discount
rates. In addition, as social values and technologies change, what is
considered avoidable also changes, adding additional uncertainty to
future projections.

"There is general consensus that, as compared to developed countries,
developing countries are more economically vulnerable to climate
extremes largely because: (i) developing countries have less resilient
economies that depend more on natural capital and climate-sensitive
activities (cropping, fishing, etc.; Parry et al., 2007); (ii) they are often
poorly prepared to deal with the climate variability and physical hazards
they currently face (World Bank, 2000); (iii) more damages are caused
by maladaptation due to the absence of financing, information, and
techniques in risk management, as well as weak governance systems;
(iv) there is generally little consideration of climate-proof investment in
regions with a fast-growing population and asset stocks (such as in coastal
areas) (IPCC, 2001; Nicholls et al., 2008); (v) there is an adaptation deficit
resulting from the low level of economic development (World Bank,
2007) and a lack of ability to transfer costs through insurance and fiscal
mechanisms; and vi) they have large informal sectors. However, in some
cases like Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, United States, developed
countries also suffer severe disasters because of social vulnerability and
inadequate disaster protection (Birch and Wachter, 2006; Cutter and
Finch, 2008).

(Hallegatte et al., 2007; Heger et al., 2008; Hallegatte and Dumas, 2009;
Loayza et al., 2009; Raddatz, 2009). In general, the observed or modeled
relationship between development and disaster impacts indicates that
a wealthier country is better equipped to manage the consequences of
extreme events by reducing the risk of impacts and by managing the
impacts when they occur. This is due (inter alia) to higher income levels,
more governance capacity, higher levels of expertise, amassed climate-
proof investments, and improved insurance systems that can act to
transfer costs in space and time (Wildavsky, 1988; Albala-Bertrand,
1993; Burton et al. 1993; Tol and Leek, 1999; Mechler, 2004;
Rasmussen, 2004; Brooks et al., 2005; Kahn, 2005; Toya and Skidmore,
2007; Raschky, 2008; Noy, 2009). While the countries with highest
income account for most of the total economic and insured losses from
disasters (Swiss Re, 2010), in developing countries there are higher
fatality rates and the impacts consume a greater proportion of GDP. This
in turn imposes a greater burden on governments and individuals in
developing countries. For example, during the period from 1970 to 2008
over 95% of deaths from natural disasters occurred in developing
countries (Cavallo and Noy, 2010; CRED, 2010). From 1975 to 2007,
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
countries accounted for 71.2% of global total economic losses from
tropical cyclones, but only suffered 0.13% of estimated annual loss of
GDP (UNISDR, 2009).

"The relationship between socioeconomic development and disasters,
including those triggered by climatic events, has been explored by a
number of researchers over the last few years using statistical
techniques and numerical modeling approaches. It has been suggested
that natural disasters exert adverse impacts on the pace and nature of
economic development (Benson and Clay, 1998, 2003; Kellenberg and
Mobarak, 2008). (The ‘poverty trap’ created by disasters is discussed in
Chapter 8.) A growing literature has emerged that identifies these
important adverse macroeconomic and developmental impacts of natural
disasters (Cuny, 1983; Otero and Marti, 1995; Benson and Clay, 1998,
2000, 2003, 2004; Charveriat, 2000; Crowards, 2000; ECLAC, 2003;
Mechler, 2004; Raddatz, 2009; Noy, 2009; Okuyama and Sahin, 2009;
Cavallo and Noy, 2010). Yet, confidence in the adverse economic
impacts of natural disasters is only medium, as, although the bulk of
studies identify negative effects of disasters on shorter-term economic
growth (up to three years after an event), others find positive effects
(Albala-Bertrand, 1993; Skidmore and Toya, 2002; Caselli and Malhotra,
2004; see Section 4.2). Differences can be partly explained by the lack
of a robust counterfactual in some studies (e.g., what would GDP have
been if a disaster had not occurred?), failure to account for the informal
sector, varying ways of accounting for insurance and aid flows, different
patterns of impacts resulting from, for example, earthquakes versus
floods, and the fact that national accounting does not record the
destruction of assets, but reports relief and reconstruction as additions
to GDP (World Bank and UN, 2010). In terms of longer-run economic
growth (beyond three years after events), there are mixed findings with
the exception of very severe disasters, which have been found to set
back development (World Bank and UN, 2010).

"Costs and impacts not only vary among developing and developed
countries, but also between and within countries, regions, local areas,
sectors, systems, and individuals due to the heterogeneity of vulnerability
and resilience (see Chapter 2). Some individuals, sectors, and systems
would be less affected, or may even benefit, while other individuals,
sectors, and systems may suffer significant losses in the same event.
In general, the poorest and those who are socially or economically
marginalized will be the most at risk in terms of being exposed and
vulnerable (Wisner et al., 2004). For example, women and children are
found to be more vulnerable to disasters in many countries, with larger
disasters having an especially unequal impact (Neumayer and Pliimper,
2007).

"It should also be noted that in a small country, a disaster can directly
affect much of the country and therefore the magnitude of losses and
recovery demands can be extremely high relative to GDP and public
financial resources (Mechler, 2004). This is particularly the case in the
event of multiple and/or consecutive disasters in short periods. For
example, in Fiji, consecutive natural disasters have resulted in reduced
national GDP as well as decreased socioeconomic development as
captured by the Human Development Index (HDI) (Lal, 2010). In Mexico,
natural disasters resulted in the HDI regressing by approximately two
years and in an increase in poverty levels (Rodriguez-Oreggia et al., 2010).
Patt et al. (2010) indicated that vulnerability in the least-developed
countries will rise most quickly, which implies an urgent need for
international assistance.

"Direct, tangible impacts are comparatively easy to measure, but costing
approaches are not necessarily standardized and assessments are often
incomplete, which can make aggregation and comparability across the
literature difficult. In some countries, flood impact assessment has long
been standardized, for example, in Britain and parts of the United States
(e.g., Handmer et al., 2002). Intangible losses can generally be estimated
using valuation techniques such as loss of life/morbidity (usually
estimated using value of statistical life benchmarks), replacement value,
benefits transfer, contingent evaluation, travel cost, hedonic pricing
methods, and so on (there is a vast literature on this subject, eg.,
Handmer et al., 2002; Carson et al., 2003; Pagiola et al., 2004; Ready
and Navrud, 2006; TEEB, 2009). Yet, assessing the intangible impacts of
extremes and disasters in the social, cultural, and environmental fields
is more difficult, and there is little agreement on methodologies (Albala-

"Studies and reports on the economic impacts of extremes, such as
insurance or post-disaster reports, have mostly focused on direct and
tangible losses, such as on impacts on produced capital and economic
activity. Intangibles such as loss of life and impacts on the natural
environment are generally not considered using monetary metrics (Parry
et al., 2009). Loss of life due to natural disasters, including future
changes, is accounted for in some studies (e.g., BTE, 2001; Jonkman,
2007; Jonkman et al., 2008; Maaskant et al., 2009). Estimates of impacts
that account for tangibles and intangibles are expected to be much
larger than those that consider tangible impacts only (Handmer et al.,
2002; Parry et al., 2009). Potential impacts include all direct, indirect,
and intangible costs, including the losses from public goods and natural
capital (in particular ecosystem services), as well as the longer-term
economic impact of disasters. Indirect impacts and intangible impacts
can outweigh those of direct impacts. There will therefore often be a
large gap between potential impacts and the estimates from studies
that consider only direct impacts.

"The top-down approach is grounded in macroeconomics under which the
economy is described as an ensemble of interacting economic sectors.
Most studies have focused on impact assessment remodeling actual
events in the past and aim to estimate the various, often hidden follow-
on impacts of disasters (e.g., Ellson et al, 1984; Yezer and Rubin, 1987;
Guimaraes et al., 1993; West and Lenze, 1994; Brookshire et al., 1997;
Hallegatte et al., 2007; Rose 2007). Existing macroeconomic or top-
down approaches utilize a range of models such as the Input-Output,
Social Accounting Matrix multiplier, Computable General Equilibrium
models, economic growth frameworks, and simultaneous-equation
econometric models. These models attempt to capture the impact of the
extreme event as it is felt throughout the whole economy. Only a few
models have aimed at representing extremes in a risk-based framework
in order to assess the potential impacts of events and their probabilities
using a stochastic approach, which is desirable given the fact that extreme
events are non-normally distributed and the tails of the distribution
matter (Freeman et al., 2002; Mechler, 2004; Hallegatte and Ghil, 2007;

benefits to society and comparing this to mitigation, often using
Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs). The IAM approach leads to a
broader estimate of costs (and benefits) over long time scales, but

establishing a baseline development path (for a country or all countries)

"Over the last few years, a wide range of methodologies using different
metrics, time periods, and assumptions has been developed and applied
for assessing adaptation costs and benefits. However, much of the
literature remains focused on gradual changes such as sea level rise and
effects on agriculture (IPCC, 2007). Extreme events are generally
represented in an ad hoc manner using add-on damage functions based
on averages of past impacts and contingent on gradual temperature
increase (see comment in Nordhaus and Boyer, 2000). In a review of
existing literature, Markandya and Watkiss (2009) identify the following
types of analyses: investment and financial flows; impact assessments
(scenario-based assessments); vulnerability assessments; adaptation
assessments; risk management assessments; economic integrated
assessment models; multi-criteria analysis; computable general
equilibrium models; cost-benefit analysis; cost effectiveness analysis;
and portfolio/real options analysis.

"An example illustrating methodological challenges comes from agriculture,
where estimates have been made using various assumptions about
adaptation behavior (Schneider et al., 2000). These assumptions about
behavior range from the farmers who do not react to observed changes in
climate conditions (especially in studies that use crop yield sensitivity to
weather variability) (Deschénes and Greenstone, 2007; Lobell et al., 2008;
Schlenker and Lobell, 2010), to the introduction of selected adaptation
measures within crop yield models (Rosenzweig and Parry, 1994), to the
assumption of ‘perfect’ adaptation — that is, farmers have complete or
‘perfect’ knowledge and apply that knowledge in ways that ensure
outcomes align exactly with theoretical predictions (Kurukulasuriya and
Mendelsohn, 2008a,b; Seo and Mendelsohn, 2008). Realistic assessments
fall between these extremes, and a realistic representation of future
adaptation patterns depends on the in-due-time detection of the climate
change signal (Schneider et al., 2000; Hallegatte, 2009); the inertia in
adoption of new technologies (Reilly and Schimmelpfennig, 2000); the
existence of price signals (Fankhauser et al., 1999); and assessments of
plausible behavior by farmers.

"Overall, measuring the many effects of disasters is problematic, prone to
both overestimation (for example, double counting) and underestimation
(because it is difficult to value loss of life or damage to the environment).
Both over- and underestimation can be issues in different parts of the same
impact assessment, for example, ecological and quality of life impacts may
be ignored, while double counting occurs in the measurement of indirect
impacts. As discussed earlier in this section, most large-scale estimates
leave out significant areas of cost and are therefore underestimates.
Biases also affect the accuracy of estimates; for example, the prospect
of aid may create incentives to inflate losses. How disaster impacts are
evaluated depends on numerous factors, such as the types of impacts
being evaluated, the objective of the evaluation, the spatial and temporal
scale under consideration, and importantly, the information, expertise,
and data available. In practice, the great majority of post-disaster
impact assessments are undertaken pragmatically using whatever data
and expertise are available. Many studies utilize both partial and general
equilibrium analysis in an ‘integrated assessment’ that attempts to capture
both the bottom-up and the economy-wide impacts of disasters (Ciscar,
2009; World Bank, 2010).

"Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is an established tool for determining the
economic efficiency of development interventions. CBA compares the
costs of conducting such projects with their benefits and calculates the
net benefits or economic efficiency (Benson and Twigg, 2004). Ideally CBA
accounts for all costs and benefits to society including environmental
impacts, not just financial impacts on individual businesses. All costs
and benefits are monetized so that tradeoffs can be compared with a
common measure. The fact that intangibles and other items that are
difficult to value are often left out is one of the major criticisms of the
approach (Gowdy, 2007). In the case of disaster risk reduction (DRR)
and adaptation interventions, CBA weighs the costs of the DRR project
against the disaster damage costs avoided. While the benefits created
by development interventions are the additional benefits due to, for
example, improvements in physical or social infrastructure, in DRR the
benefits are mostly the avoided or reduced potential damages and losses
(Smyth et al., 2004). The net benefit can be calculated in terms of net
present value, the rate of return, or the benefit-cost ratio. OECD
countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as
international financial institutions such as the World Bank, Asian

expressed in probabilistic terms. Costs and benefits should be calculated
by multiplying probability by consequences; this leads to risk estimates
that account for hazard intensity and frequency, vulnerability, and

"There are several complexities and uncertainties inherent in the estimates
required for a CBA of DRR. As these are compounded by climate change,
CBA’s utility in evaluating adaptation may be reduced. These include
difficulties in handling intangibles and, as is particularly important for
extremes, in the discounting of future impacts; CBA does not account
for the distribution of costs and benefits or the associated equity issues.
Moench et al. (2007) argue that CBA is most useful as a decision support
tool that helps the policymaker categorize, organize, assess, and present
information on the costs and benefits of a potential project, rather than
give a definite answer. Overall, the applicability of rigorous CBAs for
evaluations of adaptation is thus limited based on limited evidence and

"Attribution of changes in individual weather and climate events to
anthropogenic forcing is complicated because any such event might
have occurred by chance in an unmodified climate as a result of natural
climate variability (see FAQ 3.2). An approach that addresses this problem
is to look at the likelihood of such an event occurring, rather than the
occurrence of the event itself (Stone and Allen, 2005). For example,
human-induced changes in mean temperature have been shown to
increase the likelihood of extreme heat waves (Meehl and Tebaldi, 2004;
Stott et al, 2004). For a large region of continental Europe, Stott et al.
(2004) showed that anthropogenic climate change very likely doubled
the probability of surpassing a mean summer temperature not exceeded
since advent of the instrumental record in 1851, but which was by the
2003 event in Europe. More recent work provides further support for
such a linkage (Barriopedro et al., 2011; see Section 3.3.1).

change, especially for agriculture. Those studies considering extreme
events, and finding or reporting net benefits over a number of key
options (Agrawala and Fankhauser, 2008; Parry et al., 2009), do so by
treating extreme events similarly to gradual onset phenomena and
using deterministic impact metrics, which is problematic for disaster
risk. A recent, risk-focused study (ECA, 2009) concentrating on national
and sub-national levels went so far as to suggest an adaptation cost

2011; UNISDR, 2009; Mechler and Kundzewicz, 2010; Swiss Re 2010;
Munich Re, 2011). A key question concerns whether trends in such
losses, or losses from specific events, can be attributed to climate
change. In this context, changes in losses over time need to be
controlled for exposure and vulnerability. Most studies of long-term
disaster loss records attribute these increases in losses to increasing
exposure of people and assets in at-risk areas (Miller et al., 2008;
Bouwer, 2011), and to underlying societal trends — demographic,
economic, political, and social — that shape vulnerability to impacts
(Pielke Jr. et al., 2005; Bouwer et al., 2007). Some authors suggest that
a (natural or anthropogenic) climate change signal can be found in the
records of disaster losses (e.g., Mills, 2005; Hoppe and Grimm, 2009),
but their work is in the nature of reviews and commentary rather than
empirical research. Attempts have been made to normalize loss records
for changes in exposure and wealth. There is medium evidence and high
agreement that long-term trends in normalized losses have not been
attributed to natural or anthropogenic climate change (Choi and Fisher,
2003; Crompton and McAneney, 2008; Miller et al., 2008; Neumayer
and Barthel, 2011). The evidence is medium because of the issues set
out toward the end of this section.

"The statement about the absence of trends in impacts attributable
to natural or anthropogenic climate change holds for tropical and
extratropical storms and tornados (Boruff et al., 2003; Pielke Jr. et al.,
2003, 2008; Raghavan and Rajesh, 2003; Miller et al 2008; Schmidt et al.,
2009; Zhang et al., 2009; see also Box 4-2). Most studies related increases
found in normalized hurricane losses in the United States since the
1970s (Miller et al., 2008; Schmidt et al., 2009; Nordhaus, 2010) to the
natural variability observed since that time (Miller et al. 2008; Pielke Jr. et
al., 2008). Bouwer and Botzen (2011) demonstrated that other normalized
records of total economic and insured losses for the same series of
hurricanes exhibit no significant trends in losses since 1900.

"On a global scale, annual material damage from large weather and
climate events has been found to have increased eight-fold between the
1960s and the 1990s, while the insured damage has been found to have
increased by 17-fold in the same interval, in inflation-adjusted monetary
units (Mechler and Kundzewicz, 2010). Between 1980 and 2004, the
total costs of extreme weather events totaled US$ 1.4 trillion, of which
only one-quarter was insured (Mills, 2005). Material damages caused by
natural disasters, mostly weather- and water-related, have increased
more rapidly than population or economic growth, so that these factors
alone may not fully explain the observed increase in damage. The loss
of life has been brought down considerably (Mills, 2005; UNISDR, 2011).
"	Text
"The absence of an attributable climate change signal in losses also holds
for flood losses (Pielke Jr. and Downton, 2000; Downton et al., 2005;
Barredo, 2009; Hilker et al., 2009), although some studies did find recent
increases in flood losses related in part to changes in intense rainfall
events (Fengqing et al., 2005; Chang et al., 2009). For precipitation-
related events (intense rainfall, hail, and flash floods), the picture is
more diverse. Some studies suggest an increase in damages related to
a changing incidence in extreme precipitation (Changnon, 2001, 2009),
although no trends were found for normalized losses from flash floods
and landslides in Switzerland (Hilker et al., 2009). Similarly, a study of
normalized damages from bushfires in Australia also shows that increases
are due to increasing exposure and wealth (Crompton et al., 2010).
"	Text
"Another general area of uncertainty comes from confounding factors
that can be identified but are difficult to quantify, and relates to the
usual assumption of constant vulnerability in studies of loss trends.
These include factors that would be expected to increase resilience
(Chapters 2 and 5 of this report) and thereby mask the influence of
climate change, and those that could act to increase the impact of
climate change. Those that could mask the effects of change include
gradual improvements in warnings and emergency management (Adger
et al, 2005), building regulations (Crichton, 2007), and changing
lifestyles (such as the use of air conditioning), and the almost instant
media coverage of any major weather extreme that may help reduce
losses. In the other direction are changes that may be increasing risk,
such as the movement of people in many countries to coastal areas
prone to cyclones (Pompe and Rinehart, 2008) and sea level rise.
"	Text
"Increasing exposure of people and economic assets has been the major
cause of long-term increases in economic losses from weather- and
climate-related disasters (high confidence). The attribution of economic
disaster losses is subject to a number of limitations in studies to date:
data availability (most data are available for standard economic sectors
in developed countries); type of hazards studied (most studies focus on
cyclones, where confidence in observed trends and attribution of
changes to human influence is /ow; Section 3.4.4); and the processes
used to normalize loss data over time. Different studies use different
approaches to normalization, and most normalization approaches take
account of changes in exposure of people and assets, but use only limited,
if any, measures of vulnerability trends, which is questionable. Different
approaches are also used to handle variations in the quality and
completeness of data on impacts over time. Finding a trend or ‘signal’
in a system characterized by large variability or ‘noise’ is difficult and
requires lengthy records. These are all areas of potential weakness in
the methods and conclusions of longitudinal loss studies and more
empirical and conceptual efforts are needed. Nevertheless, the results of
the studies mentioned above are strengthened as they show similar
results, although they have applied different data sets and methodologies.

where during the period from 2001 to 2006 losses amounted to about
1% of GDP, while this ratio has been about 0.3% of GDP for low-income

on limited evidence (Cummins and Mahul, 2009). In small exposed
countries, particularly small island developing states, these wealth losses
expressed as a percentage of GDP and averaged over both disaster and
non-disaster years can be considerably higher, exceeding 1% in many
cases and 8% in the most extreme cases over the period from 1970 to
2010 (World Bank and UN, 2010), and individual events may consume
more than the annual GDP (McKenzie et al., 2005). This indicates a far
higher vulnerability of the economic infrastructure in developing

"Percentage of direct economic losses by regions: The concentration of
information on disaster risk generally is skewed toward developed
countries and the Northern Hemisphere (World Bank and UN, 2010).
Some global databases, however, do allow a regional breakdown of
disaster impacts. The unequal distribution of the human impact of natural
disasters is reflected in the number of disasters and losses across regions
(Figure 4-7). In the period 2000 to 2008, Asia experienced the highest
number of weather- and climate-related disasters. The Americas suffered
the most economic loss, accounting for the highest proportion (54.6%)
of total loss, followed by Asia (27.5%) and Europe (15.9%). Africa
accounted for only 0.6% of global economic losses, but economic damages
from natural disasters are underreported in these data compared to
other regions (Vos et al., 2010). Although reporting biases exist, they are
judged to provide robust evidence of the regional distribution of the
number of disasters and of direct economic losses for this recent period
2000 to 2008, and there is high agreement regarding this distribution
among different databases collected by independent organizations
(Guha-Sapir et al., 2011; Munich Re, 2011; Swiss Re, 2011).

"These statistics imply the increasing cost of such disasters to society,
regardless of cause. It is also important to note that the number of
weather- and climate-related disasters has increased more rapidly than
losses from non-weather disasters (Mills, 2005; Munich Re, 2011; Swiss
Re, 2011). This could indicate a change in climate extremes, but there
are other possible explanations (Bouwer, 2011). Drought and flood
losses may have grown due to a number of non-climatic factors, such as
increasing water withdrawals effectively exacerbating the impact of
droughts, decrease in storage capacity in catchments (urbanization,
deforestation, sealing surfaces, channelization) adversely affecting both
flood and drought preparedness, increase in runoff coefficients, and
growing settlements in floodplains around urban areas (see Section
4.2.2; Field et al., 2009).

"It is more likely than not that the frequency of the most intense tropical
cyclones will increase substantially in some ocean basins (Section 3.4.4).
Many studies have investigated impacts from tropical cyclones (e.g.,

presents the projected percentage increase in direct economic losses from
tropical cyclones from a number of these studies, scaled to the year 2040
relative to a common baseline (year 2000). There is high confidence that
increases in exposure will result in higher direct economic losses from
tropical cyclones and that losses will also depend on future changes in
tropical cyclone frequency and intensity. One study, building on global
climate model results from Bender et al. (2010), found that to attribute
increased losses to increased tropical cyclone activity in the United
States with a high degree of certainty would take another 260 years of
records, due to the high natural variability of storms and their impacts

"It is well known that the frequency and intensity of extreme weather
and climate events are only one factor that affects risks, as changes in
population, exposure of people and assets, and vulnerability determine
loss potentials (see Sections 4.2 to 4.4). Few studies have specifically
quantified these factors. However, the ones that do generally underline
the important role of projected changes (increases) in population and
capital at risk. Some studies indicate that the expected changes in
exposure are much larger than the effects of climate change (see Table
4-3), which is particularly true for tropical and extratropical storms
(Pielke Jr., 2007; Feyen et al., 2009; Schmidt et al., 2009). Other studies
show that the effect of increasing exposure is about as large as the effect
of climate change (Hall et al., 2003; Maaskant et al., 2009; Bouwer et al.,
2010), or estimate that these are generally smaller (Dorland et al., 1999;
Hoes, 2007). There is therefore medium confidence that, for some climate
extremes in many regions, the main driver for future increasing losses
in many regions will be socioeconomic in nature (based on medium
agreement and limited evidence). Finally, many studies underline that
both factors need to be taken into account, as the factors do in fact
amplify each other, and therefore need to be studied jointly when
expected losses from climate change are concerned (Hall et al., 2003;
Bouwer et al., 2007, 2010; Pielke Jr., 2007; Feyen et al., 2009).

climate-proofing of existing and new infrastructure, using more precise
unit cost estimates and including the costs of maintenance as well a:
those of port upgrading and the risks from sea level rise and stort

impacts of extreme weather is calculated. Estimates of costs to adapt tc
climate change (rather than simply to extremes and disasters), whict
have mostly been made for developing countries, exhibit a large range

For 2030, the estimated global cost from UNFCCC (2007) ranges frorr
US$ 48 to 171 billion per year for developed and developing countries
and US$ 28 to 67 billion per year for developing countries (in 2005
dollars). Recent estimates from World Bank (2010) for developinc
countries lead to higher projected costs and broadly amount to the
average of this range with annual costs of up to US$ 100 billion (ir
2005 US$) (see Table 4-4). Confidence in individual global estimates i:
low because, as mentioned above and discussed by Parry et al. (2009)
the estimates are derived from only three relatively independent studies
which explains the seeming convergence of the estimates in latte!
studies. As well, Parry et al. (2009) consider the estimates a significan'
underestimation by at least a factor of two to three and possibly more
if the costs incurred by other sectors were included, such as ecosysterr
services, energy, manufacturing, retailing, and tourism. The adaptatior
cost estimates are also based mostly on low levels of investment due tc
an existing adaptation deficit in many regions. Unavoidable residua
damages remain absent from these analyses.

vulnerability and exposure will also change over time, and the
interaction of these aspects should be considered (see, e.g., Hallegatte,
2008; Hochrainer and Mechler, 2011). This has been recognized and
assessments of climate change impacts, vulnerability, and risk are
changing in focus, leading to more integration across questions. While
initial studies focused on an analysis of the problem, the field proceeded
to assess potential impacts and risks, and now more recently started to
combine such assessments with the consideration of specific risk
management methods (Carter et al., 2007).

"Data availability and consistency: Lack of data and robust information
increases the uncertainty of costing when scaling up to global levels from
a very limited (and often very local) evidence base. There are double-
counting problems and issues of incompatibility between types of
impacts in the process of multi-sectoral and cross-scale analyses,
especially for the efforts to add both market and non-market values (e.g.,
ecosystem services) (Downton and Pielke Jr., 2005; Pielke Jr. et al., 2008;
Parry et al., 2009). Moreover the full impacts of weather- and climate-
related extremes in developing countries are not fully understood, and
a lack of comprehensive studies on damage, adaptation, and residual
costs indicates that the full costs are underestimated.
"	Text
"Upon reviewing the estimates to date, the costing of weather- and
climate-related disasters and estimating adaptation costs is. still
preliminary, incomplete, and subject to a number of assumptions with
the result that there is considerable uncertainty (Agrawala and
Fankhauser, 2008; Parry et al., 2009). This is largely due to modeling
uncertainties in climate change and damage estimates, limited data
availability, and methodological shortcomings in analyzing disaster
damage statistics. Such costing is further limited by the interaction
between numerous adaptation options and assumptions about future
exposure and vulnerabilities, social preferences, and technology, as well
as levels of resilience in specific societies. Additionally the following
challenges can be identified.
"	Text
"Some studies have suggested incorporating an analysis of the ongoing
or chronic economic impact of disasters into the adaptation planning
process (Freeman, 2000). A fuller assessment of disaster cost at varying
spatial and temporal scales and costs related to impacts on human,
social, built, and natural capital, and their associated services at different
levels can set the stage for comparisons of post-disaster development
strategies. This would make disaster risk reduction planning and
preparedness investment more cost-effective (Gaddis et al., 2007). For
example, there is consensus on the important role of ecosystems in risk
reduction and well-being, which would make the value of ecosystem
services an integral part of key policy decisions associated with adaptation
(Tallis and Kareiva, 2006; Costanza and Farley, 2007).

"Risk assessment methods: Technical challenges remain in developing
robust risk assessment and damage costing methods. Study results can
vary significantly between top-down and bottom-up approaches. Risk-
based approaches are utilized for assessing and projecting disaster risk
(ones, 2004; Carter et al., 2007), for which input from both climate and
social scenarios is required. All climatic phenomena are subject to the
limitation that historically based relationships between damages and
disasters cannot be used with confidence to deduce future risk of
extreme events under changing characteristics of frequency and intensity
(UNDP, 2004). Yet climate models are today challenged when reproducing
spatially explicit climate extremes, due to coarse resolution and physical
understanding of the relevant process, as well as challenges in modeling
low-probability, high-impact events (see Section 3.2.3). Therefore,

"Sustainable land management is an effective disaster risk reduction tool (high agreement, robust evidence).
Land management includes land use, planning, zoning, conservation zones, buffer zones, or land acquisition. Often it
is difficult for local jurisdictions to implement such measures as a result of political and economic pressures for
development. However, such measures are often less disruptive to the environment and more sustainable at the local
level than structural measures. [5.3.3]

"Post-disaster recovery and reconstruction provide an opportunity for reducing weather- and climate-related
disaster risk and for improving adaptive capacity (high agreement, robust evidence). An emphasis on rapidly
rebuilding houses, reconstructing infrastructure, and rehabilitating livelihoods often leads to recovering in ways that
recreate or even increase existing vulnerabilities, and that preclude longer-term planning and policy changes for
enhancing resilience and sustainable development. Including local actors benefits the recovery process. [5.2.3]

"Disasters associated with climate extremes influence population mobility and relocation affecting host and
origin communities (medium agreement, medium evidence). Most people return and participate in the post-
disaster recovery in their local areas. If disasters occur more frequently and/or with greater magnitude, some local
areas will become increasingly marginal as places to live or in which to maintain livelihoods. In such cases, migration
and displacement could become permanent and could introduce new pressures in areas of relocation. For locations
such as atolls, in some cases it is possible that many residents will have to relocate. In other cases, migration is an
adaptation to climate change, with remittances supporting community members who remain at home. [5.2.2]

"Effective local adaptation strategy requires addressing a number of factors that limit the ability of local
people to undertake necessary measures to protect themselves against climate extremes and disasters
(high agreement, robust evidence). Closing the information gap is critical to reducing vulnerability of natural-
resource dependent communities. Maintaining the ability of a community to ensure equitable access and entitlement
to key resources and assets is essential to building local adaptive capacity in a changing climate. Moreover, capacity
building and development of new skills for diversifying local livelihoods are key to flexibility in disaster reduction,
improving local adaptation, and managing disasters. [5.5]

"Local-level institutions and self-organization are critical for social learning, innovations, and action; all are
essential elements for local risk management and adaptation (high agreement, medium evidence). Adaptive
capacities are not created in a vacuum — local institutions provide the enabling environment for community-based
adaptation planning and implementation. Local participation (community-based organizations, development committees)
contributes to empowering the most vulnerable and strengthening innovations. Addressing political and cultural issues

"Inequalities influence local coping and adaptive capacity and pose disaster risk management and adaptation
challenges (high agreement, robust evidence). These inequalities reflect differences in gender, age, wealth, class,

Understanding and increasing the awareness of coping mechanisms in the context of local-level livelihood is important

"5.1. Introduction: Why the Local is Important
"	Title
"Disasters occur first at the local level and affect local people. These
localized impacts can then cascade to have national and international
ramifications. As a result, the responsibility for managing such risks
requires the linkage of local, national, and global scales (Figure 5-1).
Some disaster risk management options are bottom-up strategies,
designed by and for local places, while other management options are
products of global negotiations (Chapter 7) that are then implemented
through national institutions (Chapter 6) to local levels. Institutions,
actors, governance, and geographic units of analysis are not uniform
across these scales. Even within each scale there are differences. While
some communities are able to cope with disaster risks, others have
limited disaster resilience and capacity to cope with present disaster risk
let alone adapt to climate variability and extremes. This is the topic of
this chapter: to present evidence on where disasters are experienced,
how disaster risks are managed at present, and the variability in coping
mechanisms and capacity in the face of climate variability and change,
all from the perspective of local places and local actors. The chapter
explores three themes: how disaster risks are managed at present; how the
impact of climate extremes threatens human security at the local level; and
the role of scale and context in shaping variability in vulnerability,
coping, adaptive capacity, and the management of disaster risks and
climate extremes at the local level.
"	Text
"The idea of local has many connotations. For the purposes of this report,
local refers to a range of places, management structures, institutions,
social groupings, conditions, and sets of experiences and knowledge
that exist at a scale below the national level. As administrative units,
local can range from villages, districts, suburbs, cities, and metropolitan
areas, through to regions, states, and provinces. The conception of local
includes the set of institutions (public and private) that maintain and
protect local people as well as those that have some administrative
control over space and resources. In these places, choices and actions
for disaster risk management and adaptation to climate extremes can
be initially independent of national interventions. At the local level there
is traditional knowledge about disaster risk and grassroots actions to
manage it. Functional or physical units such as watersheds, ecological
Zones, or economic regions operate at the local level, including the
private and public institutions that govern their use and management.
Each of the differing connotations of local means that there are differing
approaches to and contents of disaster risk management practice,
differing stakeholders and interest groups, and more significantly,
differing relations with the national and international levels (Adger
et al., 2005). We recognize that states and provinces in many countries
are large complex entities with similar powers as smaller nations.
Where we discuss states and provinces and similar administrative
structures in this chapter, we refer to them as sub-national for clarification
purposes.

"Local communities routinely experience hazard impacts, with many
resulting from extreme weather and climate events (see Chapter 3). The
significance of discussing these from the local perspective is that extreme
weather and climate events will vary from place to place and not all
places have the same experience with that particular initiating event.
Research demonstrates that disaster experience influences proactive
behaviors in preparing for and responding to subsequent events (see
"	Text
"Local places vary in their disaster experience, who and what is at risk, the
potential geographical extent of the potential impact and responses,
and in stakeholders and decisionmakers. Local places have considerable
experience with short-term coping responses and adjustments to disaster
risk (UNISDR, 2004), as well as with longer-term adjustments such as
the establishment of local flood defenses, the selection of drought
resistant crops, or seasonal or longer migration by one or more family
members. For example, the use of remittances is a substantial source of
post-disaster income and is regularly used as a means for diversifying
livelihoods to enhance resilience and to proactively cope with extremes
(Adger et al., 2002).

"Section 5.4.1). In the context of climate change, some localities could be
experiencing certain types of hazards for the first time and not have the
existing capacities for preparedness and response. For example,
Hurricane Catarina, the first South Atlantic hurricane that made landfall
as a category 1 storm just north of Porto Alegre, Brazil, in March 2004
(McTaggart-Cowan et al., 2006), was the region's first local experience
with a hurricane. However, there is /ow confidence in attribution of any
long-term increases in hurricane formation in this ocean region where
tropical cyclones had not been previously recorded (Table 3-2). Finally,
not all of the extreme events become severe enough to cause a disaster
of national or international magnitude, yet they will create ongoing
problems for local disaster risk management.
"	Text
"Climate-sensitive hazards such as flooding, tropical cyclones, drought,
heat, and wildfires regularly affect many localities with frequent, yet
low-level, losses (UNISDR, 2009). Because of their frequent occurrence,
localities have developed extensive reactive disaster risk management
practices. However, disaster risk management also entails the day-to-day
struggle to improve livelihoods, social services, and environmental
services. Local response and long-term adaptation to climate extremes
will require disaster risk management that acknowledges the role of
climate variability. This can mean a modification and expansion of local
disaster risk management principles and experience through innovative
organizational, institutional, and governmental measures at all
jurisdictional levels (local, national, international). Institutionally-driven
arrangements may constrain or impede local actions and ultimately
limit the coping capacity and adaptation of local places.
"	Text
"The second theme of the chapter examines how climate extremes could
threaten the human security of local populations. Because these risks
often affect the basic functioning of society, it is increasingly recognized
that climate change adaptation and disaster risk management should
be integral components of development planning and implementation
to increase sustainability (Thomalla et al., 2006; see Box 5-1). In other
words, both have to be mainstreamed into national development plans,
poverty reduction strategies, sectoral policies, and other development
tools and techniques (UNDP, 2007). For example, rural communities in
many world regions face greater risks of livelihood loss resulting from
flooding of low-lying coastal areas, water scarcity and drought, decline
in agricultural yields and fisheries resources, and loss of biological
resources (Osman-Elasha and Downing, 2007). In some African countries
where recurrent floods are closely linked with El Nifo-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) events (Ward et al., 2010), the result is major
economic and human loss seen in places such as Mozambique (Mirza,
2003; Obasi, 2005) and Somalia. For such communities, with less
developed infrastructure and health services, the impacts of floods are
often further exacerbated by health problems associated with water
scarcity and quality, such as malnutrition, diarrhea, cholera, and malaria
(Kabat et al., 2002).
"	Text
"Linking climate change and violent conflict is controversial. The conceptual debate links climate change to resource scarcity (or those
essential resources to support livelihoods), which in turn leads to human insecurity. At the local scale, there are two distinct outcomes:
armed conflict or migration, with the latter potentially leading to increased conflict in the receiving locality (Barnett and Adger, 2007;
Nordas and Gleditsch, 2007). For example, some research suggests that environmental stresses feed the tensions between localities as
they compete for land to support their livelihoods (Kates, 2000; Barnett, 2003; Osman-Elasha and El Sanjak, 2009). Extreme events such
as droughts and heat waves could increase these tensions in areas already facing situations of water scarcity and environmental
degradation, giving rise to conflicts resulting in the dislocation of large numbers of refugees and people within and across borders.
However, there is limited agreement and evidence to support the link between climate change and violent conflict, especially in Africa
(Burke et al., 2009; Buhaug, 2010). While the causal chain suggested in the literature (climate change increases the risk of violent conflict)
has found currency within the policy community, it has not been adequately substantiated in the scientific literature (low agreement and
limited evidence). Where empirical studies exist, they are methodologically flawed in a number of ways: not controlling for population
size; focusing only on conflict cases and not all migration instances; using aggregated, not disaggregated climate data at sub-national
scales; and having inherent inconsistencies in the time frames used (short-term variability in violent conflict; longer-term variability in
climate). More research on the local climate-conflict nexus is warranted in order to determine if a causal linkage exists.

"In the context of this report, the local refers to a range of
places (community, city, province, region, state), management
structures, institutions, social groupings, conditions, and sets
of experiences and knowledge that exist at a scale below the
national level. It also includes the set of institutions (public
and private) that maintain and protect social relations as well
as those that have some administrative control over space
and resources. The definition of the local influences the context
for disaster risk management, the experience of disasters, and
conditions, actions, and adaptation to climate changes. Local
is important because locals respond and experience disasters
at first hand, they retain local and traditional knowledge
valuable for disaster reduction and adaptation plans, and
lastly they implement adaptation plans.
"	Text
"Scalar considerations must also be emphasized in planning. Efforts to
forge greater and more equitable capacity at the local scale have to be
supported by policies at the national level to increase the ability of local
institutions and communities to cope with present and future risks from
climate-sensitive hazards. To effectively reduce vulnerabilities to hazards
associated with climate change, coordination across different levels and
sectors is required, in addition to the involvement of a broad range of
stakeholders beginning at the local level (UNISDR, 2004; DFID, 2006;
Tearfund., 2006; Devereux and Coll-Black, 2007; Davies, 2009). The larger
global context within which a locality is situated affects outcomes. It is
possible that the history of resource exploitation, globalization, and the
processes of development as currently practiced may be increasing, rather
than reducing disaster vulnerability at the local level (see Chapter 2).
Those choosing strategies for reducing disaster risk and adapting to
climate change, especially in developing countries, need to take these
processes into account (UNISDR, 2009).
"	Text
"In order to develop preparedness measures for disaster risk management
and climate adaptation, the vast contextual differences of localities
will have to be considered. They include differences in population
characteristics that influence vulnerability, differences in settlement
patterns ranging from urban to rural, differences in administrative units
from municipalities to provincial governments, and differences within
developing and developed country contexts. Given the wide disparities,
it is clear that single solutions for disaster risk management are not
possible. For example, there are differences between urban and rural
communities in terms of disaster and climate change vulnerability and
disaster risk and adaptation options. Given the rapid pace of urbanization
and diffusion of communication and transportation networks into distant
areas, the sharp distinction between urban and rural is less visible in
many areas. In its place is a continuum with local places exhibiting
both rural and urban characteristics with a mix of vulnerabilities and
jurisdictional issues that are neither totally urban nor rural (McGregor
et al., 2006; Aragon-Durand, 2007).
"	Text
"These contextual factors are critical to planning for climate extremes.
They suggest the need for strengthening coordination between climate
change adaptation and disaster risk management locally that will in turn
improve the implementation of plans (Mitchell and van Aalst, 2008).
Such coordination is also needed in order to avoid any negative impacts
across different sectors or scales that could potentially result from
fragmented adaptation and development plans. This is evident in the
implementation of some of the adaptation strategies, such as large-
scale agriculture, irrigation, and hydroelectric development, that may
benefit large groups or the national interests but may also harm local,
indigenous, and poor populations (Kates, 2000; Rojas Blanco, 2006).
Some sources believe that it is essential that any new disaster risk
reduction or climate change adaptation strategies must be built on
strengthening local actors and enhancing their livelihoods (Osman-Elasha,
2006a). Moreover, a key aspect of planning for adaptation at the local
level is the identification of the differentiated social impacts of climate
change based on gender, age, disability, ethnicity, geographical location,
livelihood, and migrant status (Tanner and Mitchell, 2008). Emphasis

"Local people everywhere have developed skills, knowledge, and
management systems that enable them to interact with their environment.
Often these interactions are beneficial and provide the livelihoods that
people living in local places depend on. At the same time communities
have developed ways of responding to disruptive environmental events.
These coping mechanisms include measures that seek to modify
the impacts of disruptive events, modify some of the attributes or
environmental aspects of the events themselves, and/or actions to share
or reduce the disaster risk burdens (Burton et al., 1993). By the same
token, some actions taken at local levels (e.g., deforestation and coral
mining) may also increase disaster risks. It is important to acknowledge
that while climate change may alter the magnitude and/or frequency of
some climatic extremes (see Chapter 3), other environmental, social,
political, or economic processes (many of them also global in scale) are
affecting the abilities of communities to cope with disaster risks and
climate-sensitive hazards (Wisner et al., 2004; Adger and Brown, 2009).
Accordingly, disaster losses have increased significantly in recent decades
(UNDP, 2004; UNISDR, 2004). These social, economic, and political
processes are complex and deep seated and present major obstacles to
reducing disaster risk, and may constrain efforts to reduce community

"Humanitarian assistance is often required when other measures to
reduce disasters have been unsuccessful, and plays a critical role in
helping local people cope with the effects of disasters. Such relief often
helps to offset distress and suffering at the local level and to assist in
recovery and rehabilitation. Sometimes external relief is unnecessary or
inappropriate because the local people affected by disasters often are not
completely helpless or passive and are capable of helping themselves
(Cuny, 1983; De Ville de Groyet, 2000). This view is sustained by
commonplace definitions of disasters as situations where communities
or even countries cannot cope without external assistance (Cuny, 1983;
Quarantelli, 1998).

"Relief, nevertheless, is often a critically important strategy for coping.
Relief organizations have built capacity based on experience in recent
years, have become increasingly accountable, and are obliged to follow
humanitarian principles. Despite these improvements, some problems
remain. Relief cannot cover all losses, most of which are borne locally.
Relief can undermine local coping capacities and reduce resilience and
sustainability (Susman et al., 1983; Waddell, 1989), reinforce the status
quo that was characterized by vulnerability (O'Keefe et al, 1976), and in
some cases, serve to remove independence or autonomy from disaster

phase is lost at the local level (Hillhorst, 2002). Relief is often
inequitably distributed and in some disasters there is insufficient relief.
Corruption is also a factor in some disaster relief operations with local
elites often benefiting more than others (Pelling and Dill, 2010).
Humanitarian organizations are increasingly aware of these concerns
and many are addressing them through coordination of activities,
addressing gendered inequalities, and working in partnership with local
organizations in disaster relief. There is also a growing recognition of
the need for accountability in humanitarian work (Humanitarian
Accountability Partnership International, 2011).

"Not all disasters engender the same response, as local communities
receive different levels of assistance. For example, those people most
affected by a small event can suffer just as much as a globally publicized
big event but are sometimes overlooked by relief agencies. Fast onset
and unusual disasters such as tsunamis generate considerably more
public interest and contributions from governments, NGOs, and the
public, sometimes referred to as the CNN factor (Olsen et al., 2003).
Disasters that are overshadowed by other newsworthy or media events,
such as coverage of major sporting events, are often characterized by
lower levels of relief support (Eisensee and Stromberg, 2007). Where
there is widespread media coverage, NGOs and governments are often
pressured to respond quickly with the possibility of an oversupply of
relief and personnel. This has worsened in recent times when reporters
are ‘parachuted! into disaster sites often in advance of relief teams but
they have little understanding of the contextual factors that often
underlie vulnerability to disasters (Silk, 2000). Such media coverage
often perpetrates disaster myths such as the prevalence of looting,
helplessness, and social collapse, putting pressure on interveners to
select military options for relief when humanitarian assistance would be
more helpful (Tierney et al., 2006).

"It is important to realize that the first actors providing assistance during
and after disasters are members of the affected community (De Ville de
Groyet, 2000) who provide relief through local charities, kinship networks,
or local governments. In isolated communities such as those in the outer
islands of small-island developing states, external assistance may be
subject to considerable delay and self-help is an essential element of
response, especially in the period before assistance arrives. Typically,
emergency assistance and disaster relief in developed countries comes
in the form of assistance from national and state/provincial level
governments to local communities. The provision of international relief
is usually from members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development to developing countries (Development Initiatives,
2009). The international provision of disaster relief to local places has
become highly sophisticated and much broader in scope over the past two
decades, involving both development and humanitarian organizations,
with the increasing recognition that external relief providers make use
of local knowledge in planning their relief efforts (Morgan, 1994; Darcy
and Hofmann, 2003; Méheux et al., 2010). The relief itself includes such
things as assistance in post-disaster assessment, food provision, water
and sanitation, medical assistance and health services, household goods,
temporary shelter, transport, tools and equipment, security, logistics,
communications, and community services (Bynander et al., 2005; Cahill,
2007). Many of these activities are organized into clusters of specialists
from multilateral organizations and nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs), among others, coordinated by the United Nations.

large-scale migratory patterns. Migration will have local effects, not only
for the communities generating the migrants, but those communities

voluntary the migration choice is, the more disruptive it will become. In
the context of dam construction, for example Hwang et al. (2007) found
that communities anticipating forced migration experienced stress.
Hwang et al. (2010) also found that forced migration directly led to
increased levels of depression and the weakening of social safeguards
in the relocation process. Much post-disaster relocation is temporary,
which is also associated with psychological and social effects such as
disruption of social networks and trauma (Neria et al., 2009).

"Major shares of the costs of disaster relief and recovery still fall on the
governments of disaster-affected countries. Bilateral relief is limited to
materials from donor countries and most relief is subject to relatively
strict criteria to reduce perceived levels of corruption. In both cases,
flexibility is heavily restricted. Relief can also produce local economic
distortions such as causing shops to lose business as the market
becomes flooded with relief supplies. These problems can be overcome
by directly transferring cash to local people to buy building materials,
seed, and the like. Such programs have performed well where local
supplies are available (Farrington and Slater, 2009). At the same time,
there is the view that disaster relief can create a culture of dependency
and expectation at the local level (Burby, 2006), where disaster relief
becomes viewed as an entitlement program as local communities are
not forced to bear the responsibility for their own locational choices,
land use, and lack of mitigation practices.

"Where climate change increases the marginality of livelihoods and
settlements beyond a sustainable level, communities may be forced to
migrate or be displaced (McLeman and Smit, 2006). While migration
typically has many causes, of which the environment (including climate)
is just one factor, extremes often serve as precipitating events (Hugo,
1996). Furthermore, a number of researchers consider that climate-
related migration, other than forced displacement, may not necessarily
be a problem and indeed may be a positive adaptive response, with
people who remain at the place of origin benefitting from remittances
(Barnett and Webber, 2009; Tacoli, 2009). Nomadic pastoralists migrate
as part of their livelihoods but often respond to disruptive events by
modifying their patterns of mobility (Anderson et al., 2010). Migration
is highly gendered in terms of both drivers and impacts, which differ
between men and women, although it is not clear how these differences
might be played out in the context of climate change (Hugo, 2010).

"A second coping strategy is population movements. Natural disasters
are linked with population movements in a number of ways (Hunter,
2005; Perch-Nielson et al., 2008; Warner et al., 2010). Evacuations occur
before, during, and after some disaster events. Longer-term relocation of
affected communities sometimes occurs. Relocations can be temporary or
permanent. These different forms of population movements have variable
social, psychological, health, and financial implications for the communities
concerned. Population movements may also be differentiated on the
basis of whether the mobility is voluntary or forced (displacement) and
whether or not international borders are crossed. Most contemporary
research views population mobility as a continuum from completely
voluntary movements to completely forced migrations (Laczko and
Aghazarm, 2009). The United Nations Office for the Coordination of

"In fostering sustainable and disaster-resilient areas, local response to climate extremes will require disaster risk management that
acknowledges the role of climate variability and change and the associated uncertainties and that will contribute to long-term adaptation.
In order to anticipate the risks and uncertainties associated with climate change there are a number of emerging approaches and
responses at the local level. One set of responses focus on integrating information about changing climate risks into disaster planning
and scenario assessments of the future. Setting up plans in advance, for example, enabled communication systems to be strengthened
before the extreme event struck. Another is community-based adaptation (CBA), which helps to define solutions for managing risks
while considering climate change. CBA responses provide increased participation by locals and recognition of the local context and the
access to adaptation resources and promote adaptive capacity within communities. A critical factor in community-based actions is that
community members are empowered to take control of the processes involved. Scaling up community-based approaches poses a
challenge as well as integrating climate information and other interventions such as ecosystem management and restoration, watershed
rehabilitation, agroecology, and forest landscape restoration. These types of interventions protect and enhance natural resources at the
local scale, improve local capacities to adapt to future climate, and may also address immediate development needs.

"During the post-recovery phase, reconstruction requires weighing,
prioritizing, and sequencing of policy programming, given the multiple,
and sometimes competing agendas for most decisionmakers and
operational actors. Often there are opportunities for change in policy
directions and agenda setting at local to national levels at this time
(Birkland, 1997). The post-event lobbying for action and resources
requires a balance between short-term needs and long-term goals.
The most significant is the pressure to quickly return to conditions prior
to the event rather than incorporate longer-term and more sustainable
development policies (Christoplos, 2006; Kates et al., 2006). How long
such a window will stay open or precisely what factors will make it

the provision of seeds, planting material, fertilizers, and stock, and the
remediation of land) is particularly important where local livelihoods
are directly affected such as in subsistence or semi-subsistence societies
(Dorosh et al., 2010). In addition, some climate-related disaster events,
such as droughts, do not always directly destroy the built environment

"As with relief, major problems can occur where planning and
implementation of recovery and reconstruction is taken out of the
hands of the local communities concerned. In addition, the use of
inappropriate (culturally, socially, or environmentally) materials and
techniques may render rebuilt houses unsuitable for their occupants
(Jha et al., 2010). As Davidson et al. (2007) found, this is often the
case and results in local community members having little involvement
in decisionmaking for the recovery process; instead they are used to
provide labor. It is also important to acknowledge that post-disaster
recovery often does not reach all community members and in many
recovery programs, the most vulnerable, those who have suffered the
greatest losses, often do not recover from disasters and endure long-
term hardship (Wisner et al., 2004). In this context, it is important to
take into account the diversity of livelihoods in many local areas and to
work with local residents and stakeholders to develop strategies that
are potentially more resilient in the face of future events (Pomeroy et
al., 2006).

"countries, the relocation will be international. Such relocation can have
significant social, cultural, and psychological impacts (Campbell, 201 0b).
Community relocation schemes are those in which whole communities
are relocated to a new non-exposed site. Perry and Lindell (1997)
examined one such instance in Allenville, Arizona. They developed a set
of five principles for achieving positive outcomes in relocation projects:
1) the community to be relocated should be organized; 2) all potential
relocatees should be involved in the relocation decisionmaking process;
3) citizens must understand the multi-organizational context in which
the relocation is to be conducted; 4) special attention should be
given to the social and personal needs of the relocatees; and 5) social
networks need to be preserved. For many communities relocation is
difficult, especially in those communities with communal land ownership.
In the Pacific Islands, for example, relocation within one’s own lands is
least disruptive but leaving it completely is much more difficult, as is
making land available for people who have been relocated (Campbell,
2010b).

"Recovery and reconstruction include actions that seek to establish or
re-establish the everyday life of the locality affected by disaster (Hewitt,
1997). Often reconstruction enables communities and businesses to
return to the same conditions that existed prior to the disaster, and in
so doing create the potential for further similar losses, thus reproducing
the same exposure that resulted in disaster in the first place (Jha et al.,
2010). Recovery and reconstruction (especially housing rehabilitation
and rebuilding) are among the more contentious elements of disaster
response. One of the major issues surrounding recovery is the lack
of clarity between recovery as a process and recovery as an outcome.
The former emphasizes betterment processes where pre-existing
vulnerability issues are addressed. The latter focuses on the material
manifestation of recovery such as building houses or infrastructure.
Often following large disasters, top-down programs result in rebuilding
houses but fail to provide homes (Petal et al., 2008). Moreover, haste
in reconstruction, while achieving short-term objectives, often results
in unsustainable outcomes and increasing vulnerability (Ingram et
al., 2006). As seen in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, there are
measureable local disparities in recovery, leading to questions of
recovery for whom and recovery to what (Curtis et al, 2010; Finch et
al., 2010; Stevenson et al., 2010). There are a number of obstacles to
effective and timely reconstruction including lack of labor, lack of
capacity among local construction companies, material shortages,
resolution of land tenure considerations, and insufficiency of funds
(Keraminiyage et al., 2008). While there is urgency to have people
re-housed and livelihoods re-established, long-term benefits may be
gained through carefully implemented reconstruction (Hallegatte, 2008;
Hallegatte and Dumas, 2009) in order to achieve greater disaster
resilience.

help decisionmakers adapt to a changing environment, suggesting that
such tools can increase climate literacy (Niepold et al. 2008).
Visualizations can be powerful tools, but issues of validity, subjectivity,
and interpretation must be seriously considered in such work
(Nicholson-Cole, 2004). These communications are most effective when
they take local experiences or points of view and locally relevant places

"The generation and receipt of risk information occurs through a diverse
array of channels. They include: interpersonal contact with particular

long recognized a variety of informal information source vehicles including

characteristics as perceived expertise, trustworthiness, and protection

situations such as those associated with climate extremes. For example,
participatory video production is effective in communicating the
extreme impacts of climate change (Suarez et al., 2008; Baumhardt et
al., 2009). Participatory video involves a community or group creating
their own videos through storyboarding and production (Lunch and
Lunch, 2006). Such projects are traditionally used in contexts, such as
poor communities, where there are constraints to accessing accurate
climate information (Patt and Gwata, 2002; Patt and Schroter, 2008).
Engaging with community leaders or opinion leaders in accessing social
networks through which to distribute information is another approach,
traditionally used by health educators but also applicable to the
translation of climate risks in a community context (Maibach et al.,
2008). Another approach used in health communications that is relevant
to climate education is the ‘community drama’ in which community
members engage in plays to communicate health risks (Middlekoop et al.,
2006). These types of communication projects can motivate community
action necessary to promote preparedness (Semenza, 2005; Jacobs et

"As used here, the term risk communication refers to intentional efforts
on the part of one or more sources (e.g., international agencies, national
governments, local government) to provide information about hazards
and hazard adjustments through a variety of channels to different audience
segments (e.g., the general public, specific at-risk communities). The
characteristics of messages that have a significant impact on local adoption
of adjustments involve information quality (specificity, consistency, and
source certainty), information reinforcement (number of warnings and
repetition) (Mileti and O'Brien, 1992; O'Brien and Mileti, 1992; Mileti
and Fitzpatrick, 1993), and the ways in which information is designed.
Messages targeted to specific audiences are more readily received
(Maibach et al., 2008) than those which are not. Targeting threats to
future generations may generate more concern than overt actions to
reduce contemporary climate change impacts (Maibach et al., 2008). In
addition, communication is more effective when the information
regarding risk does not exceed the capacity for coping and therefore
galvanizes resilience (Fritze et al., 2008). Some research suggests that a
focus on personal risk of specific damages of climate change can be a
central element in motivating interest and behavior change (Leiserowitz,
2007). Risk messages vary in threat specificity, guidance specificity,
repetition, consistency, certainty, clarity, accuracy, and sufficiency (Mileti

community fragmentation, poverty, and ill health of humans and biota (Kingsford, 2000). This becomes a local and regional impact of

On the most basic level, there is considerable understanding of the

understanding of what information and trusted communication
processes are necessary to generate local confidence and preparedness
for climate change (Fischhoff, 2007). The very discussion of climate
forecasts and projections within potentially impacted communities has
served as a vehicle for democratizing the drought discourse in Ceara in
Northeast Brazil (Finan and Nelson, 2001). Developing a seamless
continuum across emergency responses, preparedness, and coping and
adaptation requires insight into the demands that different types of
disasters will place upon the local area and the need to perform
basic emergency functions — pre-event assessments, proactive hazards
mitigation, and incident management (Lindell and Perry, 1996). As noted

related to water management and would cross local, regional, and national boundaries. At the national level, these dams would provide
large-scale energy needs and serve major urban centers and industrial sectors across the country. At the regional level, the large
Amazonian dams could both generate energy and assist in drought management through storage of hydrological resources (Postel et al.,
1996). Because of the expansive range and impacts of large dams, their planning and management raise a variety of scalar concerns
about climate adaptation. While on one level a dam may present benefits regionally and nationally, it may also cause serious
environmental and social problems locally (McCormick, 2009). For example, dams upstream may lead to erosion and inundation of

2009). This is accompanied by the elevation of buildings and ground
floor standards in the case of flooding (Aerts et al., 2009; Kang et al.,
2009). Though building code regulations exist, non-adoption, especially
in developing countries, is problematic (Spence, 2004). Damages to the
structure occur not only because of noncompliance with the codes, but
also through a lack of inspections, the ownership status of the structure,
and the political context and mechanisms of local governance (May and
Burby, 1998). Insurance arrangements can provide incentives to local
governments and households to implement building codes (Botzen et

"employ engineering works to provide protection from flooding such as
dikes, embankments, seawalls, river channel modification, flood gates,
and reservoirs. However, structural measures also include those that
strengthen buildings (during construction and retrofitting), that
enhance water collection in drought-prone areas (e.g., roof catchments,
water tanks, wells), and that reduce the effects of heat waves (e.g.,
insulation and cooling systems). Although many of these structural
interventions can achieve success in reducing disaster impacts, they can
also fail due to lack of maintenance, age, or due to extreme events that
exceed the engineering design level (Galloway, 2007; Doyle et al., 2008;
Galloway et al., 2009). In the event that the frequency and magnitude
of extreme events increase as a result of climate change, new design
levels may be necessary. Technical considerations should also include

"The method of protecting an entire area by building a dike has been in
use for thousands of years and is still being applied by communities in
flood-prone countries. Embankments, dikes, levees, and floodwalls are
all designed to protect areas from flooding by confining the water to a
river channel, thus protecting the areas immediately behind them.
Building dikes is one of the most economical means of flood control
(Asian Disaster Preparedness Centre, 2005). Dikes built by communities
normally involve low technology and traditional knowledge (such as
earth embankments). Sand bagging is also a very common form of
flood-proofing. Generally, structures that are built of earth are highly
susceptible to erosion, leading to channel siltation and reduced water
conveyance on the wet side and slope instability and failure on the dry
side. Slopes can be stabilized by various methods, including turfing by
planting vegetation such as Catkin grass and Vetiver grass in
Bangladesh and Thailand, respectively. However there is a continuing
debate in the region as to whether the grass strips prevent erosion,
whether erosion is in fact the main problem instead of soil fertility, and

"Decisionmaking for large-scale structural measures is often based on
cost-benefit analyses and technical approaches. In many cases,
particularly in developed countries, structural measures are subsidized
by national governments and local governments and communities are
required to cover only partial costs. In New Zealand, this led to a
preponderance of structural measures despite planning legislation that
enabled non-structural measures. As a result, the potential for major
disasters was increased and development intensified in areas with
structural measures only to be seriously devastated by events that
exceeded the engineering design level (Ericksen, 1986). Reduction of
centralized subsidies in the mid-1980s and changes in legislation saw
greater responsibility for the costs of disaster risk management falling
on the communities affected and a move toward more integrated
disaster risk reduction processes within New Zealand (Ericksen et al.,
2000). Similar trends have been observed in relation to coastal protection,
where structural measures are often favored over non-structural
options (Titus et al., 2009; Titus, 2011).

"Implementing structural measures from planning through implementation
that involve participatory approaches with local residents who are
proactively involved often leads to increased local ownership and more
sustainable outcomes. Such an example is a program of building,
managing, and maintaining cyclone shelters in Bangladesh (Zimmermann
and Stéssel, 2011). One of the key reasons why sub-national structural
projects are often ineffective is that they are approved on the basis
of technical information alone, rather than based on both technical
information and local knowledge (ActionAid, 2005; Prabhakar et al.,
2009; see also Section 5.4.4). In addition, national legislation has
important influences on the choice of disaster risk reduction strategies
at the local level as local and national institutional arrangements that
often favor structural responses over other non-structural approaches
(Burby, 2006; Galloway, 2009). Technological responses alone may also
have unintended geomorphologic and social consequences, including
increasing flood hazard in downstream locations, increasing costs of
long-term flood protection works, or increasing coastal erosion in areas
deprived of sediments by coastal protection works (Adger et al., 2005;
Hudson et al., 2008; Box 5-3).

vulnerability to future events as shown in diverse contexts such as

Kingdom (Bowden et al., 1981; Pulwarty et al., 2004; Berube and Katz,

works often enable areas to be productively used and will continue to
be needed for areas that are already densely settled, they are commonly
misperceived as providing complete protection, and actually increase
development — and thus vulnerability — in hazard-prone areas, resulting
in the so-called ‘levee effect’ (Tobin, 1995; Montz and Tobin, 2008). A
more general statement of this proposition is found in the safe development
paradox in which increased safety measures such as dams or levees
induce increased development, which in turn leads to increased exposure
and ultimately losses (Burby, 2006). The conflicting policy goals of rapid
recovery, safety, betterment, and equity and their relative strengths and
weaknesses largely reflect experience with large disasters in other
places and times. The actual decisions and rebuilding undertaken to

"Land use planning and the application of spatial hazard information is
another avenue for disaster risk management, especially hazard mitigation.
Berke and Beatley (1992) examined a range of hazard mitigation measures
and ranked them according to effectiveness and ease of enforcement.
The most effective measures include land acquisition, density reduction,
clustering of development, building codes for new construction, and
mandatory retrofit of existing structures. The high cost of land acquisition
programs can make them unattractive to small communities. There has
been limited systematic scientific characterization of the ways in which
different hazard agents vary in their threats and characteristics, thus
require different pre-impact interventions and post-impact responses by
households, businesses, and community hazard management organizations.
However, Burby et al. (1997) have found evidence for some communities
that previous occurrence of a disaster did not have a strong effect on
the number of hazard mitigation techniques subsequently employed.

"Formal approaches to land use planning as a means of disaster risk
management are often less appropriate for many rural areas in developing
countries where traditional practices and land tenure systems operate.
Systems of land tenure often are very complex and flexible and can
contribute to vulnerability reduction. In the case of pastoralists in dryland
environments, sharing of land for grazing and of access to water are
important drought responses (Anderson et al., 2010). This is not always
the case and some land tenure systems marginalize certain groups and
increase their vulnerability (Clot and Carter, 2009; Robledo et al., 2011).
There are also restrictions on land use planning in regards to slums and
squatter settlements. Poverty and the lack of infrastructure and services
increase the vulnerability of urban poor to adverse impacts from disasters,
and national governments and international agencies have had little
success in reversing such trends. As a result, successful efforts to reduce
hazard exposure have been locally led, built upon successful initiatives,
and composed of informal measures rather than those imposed by
governments at the local level (Satterthwaite et al., 2007; Zimmermann
and Stdssel, 2011).

"Changes in land use not only contribute to global climate change but
they are equally reflective of adaptation to the varying signals of
economic, policy, and environmental change (Lambin et al., 2001). Local
land use planning embedded in zoning, local comprehensive plans, and
retreat and relocation policies is a useful approach to disaster risk
management to keep people and property away from locations exposed
to risk (Burby, 1998). However, some countries and rural areas may not
have formal land use regulations that restrict development or settlement.
As land use management regulates the movement of people and
industries in hazard-prone zones, such policies face strong opposition
from development pressures, real estate interests accompanied by
property rights, and local resistance against land acquisition (Burby,
2000; Thomson, 2007). Buffer zones, setback lines in coastal zones, and
inundation zones based on flood and sea level rise projections can
result in controversies and lack of enforcement that bring temporary
resettlement, land speculation, and creation of new vulnerabilities
(Ingram et al., 2006; Jha et al., 2010). The government of Sri Lanka, for
example, created buffer zones after the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004,
and relocated people to safer locations. Distance from people's coastal
livelihoods and social disruptions led to the revision of buffers and new
resettlement (Ingram et al., 2006). In the United States, coastal retreat
measures are difficult to implement as coastal property carries high value
and wealthy property owners can exert political pressure to build along
the coast (Ruppert, 2008). Shorefront property owners and realtors
especially oppose setback regulations because they consider the
regulation to deter growth (NOAA, 2007).

"Land acquisition is another means of protecting property and people by
relocating them away from hazardous areas (Olshansky and Kartez,
1998). Many jurisdictions have the power of eminent domain to purchase
property but this is rarely used as a form of disaster risk management
(Godschalk et al., 2000) or climate change adaptation. Voluntary
acquisition of land, for example, requires local authorities to purchase
exposed properties, which in turn enables households to obtain less
risky real estate elsewhere without suffering large economic losses in
the process (Handmer, 1987), but this is rarely used in developing
countries because of lack of resources and political support. Given the
rapid population growth in coastal areas and in flood plains in many
parts of the world, and the large number and high value of exposed
properties in coastal zones in developed countries such as the United
States and Australia, this buy out strategy is cost-prohibitive and thus
rarely used (Anning and Dominey-Howes, 2009). Similarly, voluntary
acquisition schemes for developing countries are equally fraught with
problems as people have strong ties to the land, and land is held
communally in places like the Pacific Islands where community identity
cannot be separated from the land to which its members belong
(Campbell, 2010b). Land use planning alone, therefore, may not be
successful as a singular strategy but when coupled with related policies
such as tax incentives or disincentives, insurance, and drainage and
sewage systems it could be effective (Yohe et al., 1995; Cheong, 201 1b).
However, if sea level rise adversely affects local coastal areas some form
of relocation may become necessary in all exposed jurisdictions. In the
United States, some state and local governments have adopted rolling
easement policies, which allow construction in vulnerable areas subject
to the requirement that the structures will be removed if and when the
landward edge of a wetland or beach encroaches (Titus, 2011).

and giving precedence to those with the greatest need and the highest
likelihood of a positive outcome. This approach seeks to achieve the
best results for the largest number of people (Alexander, 2002; Iserson

"Food rationing is unusual in developed countries where most communities
are not based on subsistence production. Welfare systems and NGO
agencies respond to needs of those with livelihood deficits in these
countries. However, other forms of rationing do exist particularly in
response to drought events. Reductions in water use are achieved
through a number of measures including: metering, rationing (fixed
amounts, proportional reductions, or voluntary reductions), pressure
reduction, leakage reduction, conservation devices, education, plumbing
codes, market mechanisms (eg., transferable quotas, tariffs, pricing),
and water use restrictions (Lund and Reed, 1995; Froukh, 2001).

"Rationing may be seen as the initial response to food shortages at or
near the onset of a food crisis. However, in many cases rationing is
needed on a seasonal basis. Rationing at the local level is often self-
rationing instituted at the level of households — particularly poor ones
without the ability to accumulate wealth or surpluses. Often, rationing
initially occurs among women and children (Hyder et al., 2005;
Ramachandran, 2006). Most rationing takes place in response to
food shortages and is, for most poor communities, the first response
to the disruption of livelihoods (Walker, 1989; Barrett, 2002; Devereux

coral reefs, and sand dunes in alleviating the influx of large waves to the
shore (Das and Vincent, 2009). The use of dune management districts to
protect property along developed shorelines has achieved success in
many places along the US eastern shore and elsewhere (Nordstrom,

based adaptation based on sustainable watershed and community forest
management (McCall, 2010). While the extent of their protective
ecosystem functions is still debated (Gedan et al., 2011), the merits of
ecosystem services in general are proven, and development of quantified
models of the services is well under way (Barbier et al., 2008; Nelson et
al., 2009). These nonstructural measures are considered to be less
intrusive and more sustainable, and when integrated with engineering
responses provide mechanisms for adapting to disasters and climate
extremes (Galloway, 2007; Opperman et al., 2009; Cheong, 201 1a).

"Communities may take a range of approaches to cope with disaster-
induced shortages of resources, including producing surpluses and
storing them. If the surpluses are not available, rationing of food may
occur. Many localities produce food surpluses that enable them to
manage during periods of seasonal or disaster-initiated disruptions to
their food supplies, although such practices were more prevalent in pre-
capitalist societies. In Pacific Island communities, for example, food
crops such as taro and breadfruit were often stored for periods up to
and exceeding a year by fermentation in leaf-lined pits. Yams could be
stored for several years in dry locations, and most communities maintained
famine foods such as wild yams, swamp taro, and sago, which were only
harvested during times of food shortage (Campbell, 2006). The provision
of disaster relief, among other factors, has seen these practices decline
(Campbell, 2010a). In Mali, women store part of their harvest as a hedge
against drought (Intercooperation, 2008). Stockpiling and prepositioning
of emergency response equipment, materials, foods, and pharmaceuticals
and medical equipment is also an important form of disaster preparedness
at the local level, especially for many indigenous communities.

"Electricity supplies may also be disrupted by disaster events resulting in
partial or total blackouts. While a number of countries have national
electrical grids, decisions on responses to shortages are often made at
local levels causing considerable disruption to other services, domestic
customers, and to businesses. Rose et al. (2007) show that many
American businesses can be quite resilient in such circumstances,
adapting a variety of strategies including conserving energy, using
alternative forms of energy, using alternative forms of generation,
rescheduling activities to a future date, or focusing on the low- or no-
energy elements of the business operation. Rose and Liao (2005) had
similar findings for water supply disruption. Electricity storage (in
advance) and rationing may also be required when low precipitation
reduces hydroelectricity production, a possible scenario in some places
under climate projections (Vérdsmarty et al., 2000; Boyd and Ibarraran,
2009). In some cases there may be competition among a range of sectors
including industry, agriculture, electricity production, and domestic
water supply (V6rdsmarty et al., 2000) that may have to be addressed
through rationing and other measures such as those listed above.
Clear rules outlining which consumers have priority in using water or
electricity is important.

"Factors conditioning this outcome have been summed up by White et al.
(2001) as “knowing better and losing even more.” In this context,
knowing better indicates the accumulation of readily available knowledge
on drivers of impacts and effective risk management practices. For
instance, researchers had understood the consequences of a major
hurricane hitting New Orleans prior to Hurricane Katrina with fairly
detailed understanding of planning and response needs. This knowledge
appears to have been ignored at all levels of government including the
local level after Hurricane Katrina (Kates et al., 2006). White et al. (2001)
offer four explanations for why such conditions exist from an information
standpoint: 1) knowledge continues to be flawed by areas of ignorance;
2) knowledge is available but not used effectively; 3) knowledge is used
effectively but takes a long time to have an impact; and 4) knowledge
is used effectively in some respects but is overwhelmed by increases in
vulnerability and in population, wealth, and poverty. Another possibility
is that some individuals or communities choose to take the risk. For
example, there is some evidence that the value of living near the coast,
especially in developed countries, pays back the cost of the structure in
a few years due to increases in housing values (Kunreuther et al., 2009),
so the risk is worth taking by the individual and the community. Finally,
knowledge is often discounted.

"At the household and community level, individuals often engage in
protective actions to minimize the impact of extreme events on
themselves, their families, and their friends and neighbors. In some
cases individuals ignore the warning messages and choose to stay in
places of risk. The range and choice of actions are often event specific
and time dependent, but they are also constrained by location, adequate
infrastructure, socioeconomic characteristics, access to disaster risk
information, and risk perception (Tierney et al., 2001). For example,
evacuation is used when there is sufficient warning to temporarily
relocate out of harm's way such as for tropical storms, flooding, and
wildfires. Collective evacuations are not always possible given the
location, population size, transportation networks, and the rapid onset of
the event. At the same time, individual evacuation may be constrained
by a host of factors ranging from access to transportation, monetary
resources, health impairment, job responsibilities, gender, and the
reluctance to leave home. There is a consistent body of literature on
hurricane evacuations in the United States, for example, that finds:
1) individuals tend to evacuate as family units, but they often use more
than one private vehicle to do so; 2) social influences (neighbors, family,
friends) are key to individual and households evacuation decisionmaking;
if neighbors are leaving then the individual is more inclined to evacuate
and vice versa; 3) risk perception, especially the personalization of risk
by individuals, is a more significant factor in prompting evacuation than
prior adverse experience with hurricanes; 4) pets and concerns about
property safety reduce household willingness to evacuate; and 5) social
and demographic factors (age, presence of children, elderly, or pets in
households, gender, income, disability, and race or ethnicity) either
constrain or motivate evacuation depending on the particular context
(Perry and Lindell, 1991; Dow and Cutter, 1998, 2000, 2002; Whitehead
et al., 2000; Bateman and Edwards, 2002; Van Willigen et al., 2002;

McGuire et al, 2007; Sorensen and Sorensen, 2007; Edmonds and
Cutter, 2008; Adeola, 2009). Culture also plays an important role in
evacuation decisionmaking (Clot and Carter, 2009). For example, recent
studies in Bangladesh have shown that there are high rates of non-
evacuation despite improvements in warning systems and the construction
of shelters. While there are a variety of reasons for this, gender issues
(e.g., shelters were dominated by males, shelters didn’t have separate
spaces for males and females) have a major influence upon females not
evacuating (Paul and Dutt, 2010; Paul et al, 2010).

where everyone is taught at an early age to mobilize quickly in the case
of a natural disaster (Sims and Vogelmann, 2002; Bermejo, 2006). The
organization of civil defense committees at block, neighborhood, and
community levels working in conjunction with centralized governmental

significant features of moral economy, such as reciprocity, barter, crop

"In many traditional or pre-capitalist societies it appears that mechanisms
existed that protected community members from periodic shocks such as
natural hazards. These mechanisms, sometimes referred to as the moral
economy, were underpinned by reciprocity and limiting exploitation so
that everyone had basic security. The mechanisms are often linked to
kinship networks, and serve to redistribute resources to reduce the impacts
on those who had sustained severe losses, and have been identified in
Southeast Asia (Scott, 1976), Western Africa (Watts, 1983), and the
Pacific Islands (Paulson, 1993). The moral economy incorporated social,
cultural, political, and religious arrangements, which ensured that all
community members had a minimal level of subsistence (see Box 5-4).
For example, traditional political systems in the semiarid Limpopo Basin
in northern South Africa enabled chiefs to reallocate surpluses during
bad years, but this practice has declined under contemporary systems
where surpluses are sold (Dube and Sekhwela, 2008). In Northern
Kenya, social security networks existed among some groups of nomadic
pastoralists that enabled food and livestock stock to be redistributed
following drought events, but these are also breaking down with the
monetization of the local economy, among other factors (Oba, 2001).

"A variety of socio-political networks that were used to offset
disaster losses existed throughout the Pacific region prior to
colonization (Sahlins, 1962; Paulson, 1993). One example of
such a system is the Suge, or graded society, which existed in
northern Vanuatu, a small island nation in the South West
Pacific Ocean. In the Suge ‘big men’ achieved the highest
status by accumulating surpluses of valued goods such as shell
money, specially woven mats, and pigs. Men increased their
grade within the system by making payments of these goods
to men of higher rank. In accumulating the items men would
also accumulate obligations to those they had borrowed from.
Accordingly, networks and alliances emerged among the
islands of northern Vanuatu. When tropical cyclones destroyed
crops, the obligations could be called in and assistance given
from members of the networks who lived in islands that
escaped damage (Campbell, 1990). A number of processes
associated with colonialism (changes to the socio-political
order), the introduction of the cash economy (the replacement
of shell money), and religious conversion that resulted in the
banning of the Suge), as well as the provision of post-disaster
relief, have caused a number of elements of the moral economy

responses at the local level is through participatory approaches to
disaster risk reduction such as Community-Based Disaster Reduction or
Community-Based Disaster Preparedness (see Section 5.6.2). Such
approaches build on local needs and priorities, knowledge, and social
structures and are increasingly being used in relation to climate change
adaptation (Reid et al., 2009).

"Similar to empowerment is the role of localized social norms, social
capital, and social networks as these also shape behaviors and actions
before, during, and after extreme events. Each of these factors operates
on their own and in some cases also intersects with the others. As
vulnerability to disasters and climate change is socially constructed
(Sections 2.4 and 2.5.2), the breakdown of collective action often leads
to increased vulnerability. Norms regarding gender also play a role in
determining outcomes. For example, women were more prone to
drowning than men during the Asian tsunami because they were less
able to swim and because they were attempting to save their children
(Rofi et al., 2006; Section 2.5.8).

"Another key element of empowerment is ownership of or responsibility
for disaster management (Buvini¢ et al, 1999). This applies to all
aspects of the disaster, from the ownership of a disaster itself so that
the community has control of relief and reconstruction, to a local
project to improve preparedness. Empowerment and ownership ensure
that local needs are met, that community cohesion is sustained, and
a greater chance of success of the disaster management process.
Empowerment and ownership of the disaster impacts may be
particularly important in achieving useful (for the locality) post-disaster
assessments (Pelling, 2007). It is important for external actors to
identify those voices who speak for the local constituencies. Also,
accountability and governance of disaster and climate management
issues is growing in importance.

"Social norms are rules and patterns of behavior that reflect expectations
of a particular social group (Horne, 2001). Norms structure many different
kinds of action regarding climate change (Pettenger, 2007). Norms are
embedded in formal institutional responses, as well as informal groups
that encounter disasters (Raschky, 2008). Norms of reciprocity, trust,
and associations that bridge social divisions are a central part of social
cohesion that fosters community capacity (Kawachi and Berkman, 2000).
A number of types of groups drive norms and, consequently, vulnerability,
including religious, neighborhood, cultural, and familial groups (Brenkert
and Malone, 2005). In the occurrence of extreme events, affected
groups interact with one another in an attempt to develop a set of
norms appropriate to the situation, otherwise known as the emergent
norm theory of collective behavior (NRC, 2006). This is true of those first
affected at the local level whose norms and related social capital affect
capacity for response (Dolan and Walker, 2004).

"Social capital is a multifaceted concept that captures a variety of social
engagements within the community that bonds people and generates a
positive collective value. It is also an important element in disaster
preparedness, coping, and response. It is an important element in the
face of climate extremes because community social resources such as
networks, social obligations, trust, and shared expectations create social
capital to prevent, prepare, and cope with disasters (Dynes, 2006). In
climate change adaptation, scholars and policymakers increasingly
promote social capital as a long-term adaptation strategy (Adger, 2003;
Pelling and High, 2005). Although often positive, social capital can have
some negative outcomes. Internal social networks are oftentimes self-
referential and insular (Portes and Landolt, 1996; Dale and Newman, 2010).
This results in a closed society that lacks innovation and diversity, which
are essential elements for climate change adaptation. Disaster itself is
overwhelming, and can lead to the erosion of social capital and the
demise of the community (Ritchie and Gill, 2007). This invites external
engagement beyond local-level treatment of the disaster and extreme
events (Brondizio et al., 2009; Cheong, 2010). The inflow of external aids,
expertise, and the emergence of new groups to cope with disaster are
indicative of bridging and linking social capital beyond local boundaries.

"A critical factor in community-based disaster risk reduction is that
community members are empowered to take control of the processes
involved. Marginalization (Mustafa, 1998; Adger and Kelly, 1999; Polack,
2008) and disempowerment (Hewitt, 1997) are critical factors in creating
vulnerability and efforts to reduce these characteristics play an important
role in building resilient communities. In this chapter, empowerment
refers to giving community members control over their lives with support
from outside (Sagala et al., 2009). This requires external facilitators to
respect community structures and traditional and local knowledge
systems, to assist but not take a dominating role, to share knowledge,
and to learn from community members (Petal et al., 2008). A key element
in empowering communities is building trust between the community
and the external facilitators (Sagala et al., 2009). In the Philippines, for
example, Allen (2006) found that many aspects of community disaster
preparedness such as building on local institutions and structures, building
local capacity to act independently, and building confidence through
achieving project outcomes were already present. She also found that
where agencies focused on the physical hazard as the cause of disasters
and neglected the underlying causes of the social vulnerability within
these small specific projects, the result was disempowerment. It is also
important to note that communities have choices from a range of
disaster management options (Mercer et al., 2008). Empowerment in
community-based disaster risk management may also be applied to
groups within communities whose voice may otherwise not be heard or
who are in greater positions of vulnerability (Wisner et al., 2004). These
include women (Wiest et al., 1994; Bari, 1998; Clifton and Gell, 2001;
Polack, 2008) and disabled people (Wisner, 2002).

Salick and Ross, 2009; Turner and Clifton, 2009). Research is emerging
that helps to document changes that local people are experiencing
(Ensor and Berger, 2009; Salick and Ross, 2009). Although this evidence

Mt. Khawa Karpo, local documentation of warmer temperatures, less
snow, and glacial retreat across areas were consistent, whereas other
observations were more varied, including those for river levels and
landslide incidences (Byg and Salick, 2009). In Gitga’at (Coast Tsimshian)
Nation of Hartley Bay, British Columbia, indigenous people observe the
decline of some species but also new appearances of others, anomalies
in weather patterns, and declining health of forests and grasslands that
have affected their ability to harvest food (Turner and Clifton, 2009). The
Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium generated climate change and
health impact assessment reports from observations, data, and traditional

"At the same time, it is important to note that social networks may not
always be sufficient to foster effective adaptation to extreme events.
Some social networks actually discourage people from moving away
from high risk zones, such as has been the case in storms and floods
when residents have not wanted to leave (Eisenman et al., 2007). The
impacts of climate change itself may also change the structure and utility
of social networks. As people migrate away from climate and other risks
or are pulled toward alternative locations for social or ecological
resources, those left behind can experience fragmented or weakened
social networks. The utilization of social networks can also be prevented
by the status of particular social groups, such as illegal and legal settlers
or immigrants (Wisner et al., 2004). Other social and environmental
contextual factors must be considered when conceptualizing the role of
social networks in managing extreme events. For example, strong social
networks have facilitated adaptability in Inuit communities, but are being
undermined by the dissolution of traditional ways of life (Ford et al., 2006).

"Integration of local knowledge with external scientific, global, and
technical knowledge is an important dimension of climate change
adaptation and disaster management. Experiences in environmental
management and integrated assessment suggest mechanisms for such
knowledge transfers from the bottom up and from the top down (Burton
et al, 2007; Prabhakar et al., 2009). For example, communities set up
trusted intermediaries to transfer and communicate external knowledge
such as technology-based early warning systems and innovative and
sustainable farming techniques that incorporate the local knowledge
system (Bamdad, 2005; Kristjanson et al., 2009). Another example is the
re-engineering of local practices to adapt to climate change as shown
in the conversion of traditional dry-climate adobe construction to more
stabilized earth construction built to withstand regular rainfall. The
utilization of participatory methods to draw in the perspectives of local
stakeholders for subsequent input into hazards vulnerability assessments
or climate change modeling or scenario development is well documented.
Stakeholder interactions and related workshops using participatory or
mediated modeling elicit discussions of model assumptions, local impacts,
consistencies of observed and modeled patterns, and adaptation
strategies (Cabrera et al., 2008; Langsdale et al., 2009).

"types of dependency, such as kinship, financial exchange, or prestige
(Wellman and Berkowitz, 1988). Social networks provide a diversity of
functions, such as facilitating sharing of expertise and resources across
stakeholders (Crabbé and Robin, 2006). Networks can function to promote
messages within communities through preventive advocacy, or the
engagement of advocates in promoting preventive behavior (Weibel,
1988). Information about health risks has often been effectively distributed
through a social network structure using opinion leaders as a guide
(Valente and Davis, 1999; Valente et al., 2003), and has promising
application for changing behavior regarding climate adaptation
(Maibach et al., 2008). Such opinion leaders may span a range of types,
from formally elected officials, celebrities, and well-known leaders, to
local community members who are well-embedded in local social
networks. It is important to note that more potential has been shown in
influencing behavior through community-level interventions than
through individual-level directives at the population level (Kawachi and
Berkman, 2000). Local and international networks can support the
development of policies and practices that result in greater preparedness
(Tompkins, 2005). Local resilience in the face of climate change can be
fostered by strong social networks that support effective responses
(Ford et al., 2006). For example, networks facilitate the transmission of
information about risks (Berkes and Jolly, 2001). Therefore, communities
with stronger social networks appear to be better prepared for extreme
climate impacts because of access to information and social support

"In these adaptation strategies, the size of the local government is
important, and it varies depending on the population and location.
Primate and large cities exert more independence, whereas smaller
municipalities depend more on higher levels of the government units,
and often form associations to pool their resources (Lundqvist and
Borgstede, 2008). In the latter case, state-mandated programs and state-
generated grants are the main incentives to formulate mitigation policies
(Aall et al, 2007) and can be applicable to adaptation policies. Lack of

privatization has inhibited this robust strategy. Also in Botswana, it has

of the local government to formulate and implement adaptation policies.
Aligning local climate adaptation policies with the state/provincial and
national/federal units is a significant challenge for local governments
(Roberts, 2008; van Aalst et al., 2008). The case of decentralization in
climate change adaptation is relatively new, and we can draw some
lessons from decentralized natural resource management and crisis
management. One of the problems of decentralization has been the
complexity and uniqueness of each locality that policy planners often
failed to take into account because of the lack of understanding and
consultation with the local community, and this could result in
recentralizing the entire process in some instances (Ribot et al., 2006;
Geiser and Rist, 2009). Some remedies include working with local
institutions, ensuring appropriate transfer of various rights and access,
and providing sufficient time for the process (Ribot, 2003). The crisis

"Some assessments of urban adaptations exist. For example, adaptation
efforts in eight cities (Bogota, Cape Town, Delhi, Pearl River Delta, Pune,

both formal adaptation plans and less formal adaptation studies in nine
cities including Boston, Cape Town, Halifax, Ho Chi Minh City, London,
New York, Rotterdam, Singapore, and Toronto demonstrates that the
focus is mostly on risk reduction and the protection of citizens and
infrastructure, with Rotterdam seeing adaptation as opportunity for
transformation (Birkmann et al., 2010). These nine cities have focused
more on expected biophysical impacts than on socioeconomic impacts
and have not had a strong focus on vulnerability and the associated
susceptibility or coping capacity. Despite the intention that city adaptation
responses aim at an integrated approach, they tend to have sectoral
responses, with limited integration of local voices. There is a good
understanding of the impacts, but the implementation of policy and
outcomes on the ground are harder to see (Bulkeley, 2006; Burch and

"informing responses as they help shape efficiency, effectiveness, equity,
and legitimacy (Adger et al, 2003; UNISDR, 2009). Some places centralize
climate change management practices at the national level (see
Chapter 6). This may be due to the ways in which many climate
extremes affect environmental systems that cross political boundaries
resulting in discordance if solely locally managed (Cash and Moser,
2000) but could also be based on old practices of operations. In other
places, actions are more decentralized, emerging at the local level and
tailored to local contexts (Bizikova et al., 2008). If multiple levels of
planning are to be implemented, mechanisms for facilitation and guidance
at the local level are needed in order that fairness is guaranteed during
the implementation of national policies at the local scale (Thomas and
Twyman, 2005). Local governments play an important role as they are
responsible for providing infrastructure, preparing and responding to
disasters, developing and enforcing planning, and connecting national
government programs with local communities (Huq et al., 2007; UNISDR,
2009). The quality and provision of these services have an impact on
disaster and climate risk (Tanner et al., 2009). Effective localized
planning, for example, can minimize both the causes and consequences
of climate change (Bulkeley, 2006).

groups in the ability to prepare for, respond to, recover from, and adapt
to disasters and climate extremes. During the last century, social science
researchers have examined those factors that influence coping responses
by households and local entities through post-disaster field investigations
as well as pre-disaster assessments (Mileti, 1999; NRC, 2006). Among
the most significant individual characteristics are gender, age, wealth,
ethnicity, livelihoods, entitlements, health, and settlements. However, it

"Many nongovernment actors charged with managing climate risks use
community risk assessment tools to engage communities in risk reduction
efforts and influence planning at district and sub-national levels (van

activities ranges from demonstration projects, training and awareness-
raising, legal assistance, alliance building, small-scale infrastructure,
and socioeconomic projects, to mainstreaming and advocacy work (Luna,
2001; Shaw, 2006). Bridging citizen-government gaps is a recognized
role of civil society organizations and NGOs often act as social catalysts
or social capital, an essential for risk management in cities (Wisner,
2003). Conversely, the potential benefits of social capital are not always
maximized due to mistrust, poor communications, or lack of functioning
either within municipalities or nongovernment agencies. This has major
implications for risk reduction (Wisner, 2003) and participation of the
most vulnerable in nongovernment initiatives at municipal or sub-
national level is not guaranteed (Tanner et al., 2009).

"The literature suggests that at the local level gender makes a difference
in vulnerability (Section 2.4) and in the differential mortality from
disasters (Neumayer and Pliimper, 2007). The evidence is robust with
high agreement. |n disasters, women tend to have different coping
strategies and constraints on actions than men (Fothergill, 1996;
Morrow and Enarson, 1996; Peacock et al., 1997). These are due to
socialized gender factors such as social position (class), marital status,
education, wealth, and caregiver roles, as well as physical differences in
stature and endurance. At the local level for example, women’s lack of
mobility, access to resources, lack of power and legal protection, and
social isolation found in many places across the globe tend to augment
disaster risk, and vulnerability (Schroeder, 1987; IFRC, 1991; Mutton and
Haque, 2004; UNIFEM, 2011). Relief and recovery operations are often
insensitive to gender issues (Hamilton and Halvorson, 2007), and so the
provision of such supplies and services also influences the differential
capacities to cope (Enarson, 2000; Ariyabandu, 2006; Wachtendorf et
al., 2006; Fulu, 2007), especially at the local level. However, the active
participation of women has been shown to increase the effectiveness
of prevention, disaster relief, recovery, and reconstruction, thereby
improving disaster management (Enarson and Morrow, 1997, 1998;

"Although government actors play a key role, it is evident that partnerships
between public, civic, and private actors are crucial in addressing climate
hazards-related adaptation (Agrawal, 2010). While international agencies,

state, and national levels, community-based organizations (CBOs) often
have greater capacity to mobilize at the local scale (Milbert, 2006). NGO
and CBO networks play a critical role in capturing the realities of local
livelihoods, facilitating sharing information, and identifying the role of
local institutions that lead to strengthened local capacity (Bull-

strategic alliances, and local community organizations are essential to
making city planning operational (Hasan, 2007). This can be seen in the
case of the New York City Panel on Climate Change that acted as a
scientific advisory group to both Mayor Bloomberg's Office of Long-

Older people are more prone to ill health, isolation, disabilities, and

influence their coping capacities in response to extreme events (see
Case Study 9.2.1). In North America, for example, retired people often
choose to live in hazardous locations such as Florida or Baja California
because of warmer weather and lifestyles, which in turn increases their
potential exposure to climate-sensitive hazards. Often because of hearing
loss, mental capabilities, or mobility, older persons are less able to receive
warning messages or take protective actions, and are more reluctant to
evacuate (O'Brien and Mileti, 1992; Hewitt, 1997). However, older people

greater potential for large monetary losses, but at the same time, they
have the resources (insurance, income, political cache) to cope with the

vulnerable. In Asia, for example, wealth shifted construction practices
from wood to masonry, which made many of the cities more vulnerable
and less able to cope with disaster risk (Bankoff, 2007), especially in
seismic regions. Poorer localities and populations often live in cheaper
hazard-prone locations, and face challenges not only in responding to
the event, but also recovering from it. Poverty also enhances disaster
risk (Carter et al., 2007). In some instances, it is neither the poor nor
the rich that face recovery challenges, but rather localities that are
in between, such as those not wealthy enough to cope with the

"Women's involvement in running shelters and processing food

Hurricane Mitch hit Honduras. One-third of the shelters were

municipality of La Masica in Honduras, with a mostly rural
population of 24,336 people, stands out in the aftermath of
Mitch because, unlike other municipalities in the northern
Atlanta Department, it reported no mortality. Some attributed
this outcome to a process of community emergency
preparedness that began about six months prior to the

community decided that men and women should participate

local infrastructure (such as schools), and along with men,
distributed food. They also took over from men who had

"Entitlements are assets of the individuals and household. Assets are
broadly defined and include not only physical assets such as land, but
also human capital such as education and training. At the local scale
assets include institutional assets such as technical assistance or credit;
social capital such as mutual assistance networks; public assets such as
basic infrastructure like water and sanitation; and environmental assets
such as access to resources and ownership of them (Leach et al., 1999).
The link between disaster risk, access to resources, and adaptation has
been widely documented in the literature (Sen, 1981; Adger, 2000;
Brooks, 2003). Extreme climate events generally lead to entitlement
decline in terms of the rights and opportunities that local people have
to access and command the livelihood resources that enable them to

improving the ability of localities to lessen their vulnerability and to
cope with and respond to disasters and environmental change. In some
instances, this may not be true. For example, if a disaster affects a
household asset, but the household is still paying off its debt regarding
the initial cost of the asset and assuming that the asset is not protected
or insured against hazards, the asset loss coupled with the need to pay off
the loan renders the household more vulnerable, not less (Twigg, 2001).

"Local people's livelihoods and their access to and control of resources
can be affected by events largely beyond their control such as climatic
extremes (e.g., floods, droughts), conflict, or agricultural problems such
as pests and disease and economic shocks that can largely impact their
livelihoods (Chambers and Conway, 1992; Jones et al., 2010). For poor
communities living on fragile and degraded lands such as steep hillsides,
dry lands, and floodplains, climate extremes present additional threats
to their livelihoods that could be lost completely if exposed to repeated
disastrous events within short intervals leaving insufficient time for
recovery. Actions aiming at improving local adaptive capacity focus
more on addressing the deteriorating environmental conditions. A
central element in their adaptation strategies involves ecosystem
management and restoration activities such as watershed rehabilitation,
agroecology, and forest landscape restoration (Ellis, 2000; Ellis and
Allison, 2004; Osman-Elasha, 2006b). As some suggest (Spanger-Siegfried
et al., 2005) these types of interventions often protect and enhance
natural resources at the local scale and address immediate development
priorities, but can also improve local capacities to adapt to future
climate change. The buffering capacities of local people's livelihoods
and their institutions are critical for their adaptation to extreme climate
stress. They often rest on the ability of communities to generate
potentials for self-organization and for social learning and innovations

inequalities in who can evacuate and when, with the elderly, poor, and minority residents least able to leave without assistance (Cutter

periods of evacuation can result in a number of physical and mental health problems (Curtis et al., 2007; Mills et al., 2007). Furthermore,
separation from family and community members and not knowing when a return home will be possible also adds to stress among evacuees

noted earlier (see Section 5.5.1.2), rural livelihoods and poverty are
drivers of disaster risk, but not the only ones. Poverty, resource scarcity,
access to resources, as well as inaccessibility constrain disaster risk

affect the health of many populations and these will be felt first at the
local level. Heat waves lead to heatstroke and cardiovascular disease,
while shifts in air pollution concentrations such as ozone that often
increase with higher temperatures cause morbidity from other diseases
(Bernard et al. 2001). Heat waves differentially affect populations
based on their ethnicity, gender, age (Diaz et al., 2002), and medical and
socioeconomic status (O'Neill and Ebi, 2009), consequently raising
concerns about health inequalities (see Case Study 9.2.1), especially at

climate change more generally, as those with the least resources often
have the least ability to adapt, making the poor and disenfranchised
most vulnerable to climate-related illnesses (McMichael et al., 2008).
For extreme events, pre-existing health conditions that characterize
vulnerable populations can exacerbate the impact of disaster events
since these populations are more susceptible to additional injuries from
disaster impacts (Brauer, 1999; Brown, 1999; Parati et al., 2001). Chronic

"the disaster itself, but by its consequences. Measuring indirect losses is
important as it evaluates the overall economic impact of the disaster on
society. Another difficulty with the measurement of economic losses
at the local level has to do with the boundary delineation for local
analyses. For example, local losses can be compensated from various
inflows of goods, workers, capital, and governmental or foreign aid from
outside the affected area (Eisensee and Stromberg, 2007). Local
disasters also provide ripple effects and influence world markets, for
instance, oil prices in the case of Hurricane Katrina due to the
temporary shutdown of oil rigs. It is important to consider tradeoffs at
different spatial scales especially when estimating indirect losses at the
local level. Disaster loss estimates are, therefore, highly dependent on the
scale of the analysis, and result in wide variations among community,
state, province, and sub-national regions.

"However, it is not only the megacities that pose challenges, but the
overall growth in urban populations. Currently more than half of the
global population lives in urban areas with an increasing population
exposed to multiple risk factors (UNFPA, 2009). Risk is increasing in urban
agglomerations of different size due to unplanned urbanization and
accelerated migration from rural areas or smaller cities (UN-HABITAT,
2007). The 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction
(UNISDR, 2009) lists unplanned urbanization and poor urban governance
as two main underlying factors accelerating disaster risk. It highlighted
that the increase in global urban growth of informal settlements in hazard-
prone areas reached 900 million in informal settlements, increasing by

one hurricane over a year led to a decline in economic growth on average
by 0.79% and an increase by 0.22% the following year. The economic
impact of the 1993 Mississippi flooding in the United States showed

"Local-level adaptation actions in many cases are portrayed as reactive
and short term, unlike the higher-level national or regional plans that are
considered anticipatory and involve formulation of policies and programs
(Bohle, 2001; Burton et al., 2003). Poverty, increased urbanization, and
extreme climate events limit the capacity to initiate planned livelihood
adaptations at the local scale. If extreme events happen more frequently
or with greater intensity or magnitude some locations may be
uninhabitable for lengthy and repeated periods, rendering sustainable
development impossible. In such a situation, not all places will be able
to adapt without considerable disruption and costs (economic, social,
cultural, and psychological). In some cases forced migration may be the
only alternative (Brown, 2008).

Massachusetts (Clark et al., 1998), sea level rise in Cape May, New

United States (Burton and Cutter, 2008; Zahran et al., 2008). Research

county-level assessments for all hazards (Cutter et al., 2000) to sub-
national studies such as those involving all hazards for Barbados and
St. Vincent (Boruff and Cutter, 2007) to those involving a smaller subset
of climate-related threats (O'Brien et al., 2004; Brenkert and Malone,

"One of the key issues in examining outcomes of local strategies for
disaster risk management and climate change adaptation is the principle
of fairness and equity. There is a burgeoning research literature on climate
justice looking at the differential impacts of adaptation policies
(Kasperson and Kasperson, 2001; Adger et al., 2006) at local, national,
and global scales. The primary considerations at the local level are the
differential impacts of policies on communities, subpopulations, and
regions from present management actions (or inactions) (Thomas and
Twyman, 2005). There is also concern regarding the impact of present
management (or inactions) in transferring the vulnerability of disaster risk
from one local place to another (spatial inequity) or from one generation
to another (intergenerational equity) (Cooper and McKenna, 2008).
There is less research on the mechanisms or practical actions needed for
advancing social and environmental justice at the local scale, independent
of the larger issues of accountability and governance at all scales. This
is an important gap in the literature.

"Prior to the development and implementation of management strategies
and adaptation alternatives, local entities need baseline assessments on
disaster risk and the potential impacts of climate extremes. The assessment
of local disaster risk includes three distinct elements: 1) exposure
hazard assessment, or the identification of hazards and their potential
magnitudes/severities as they relate to specific local places (see
below); 2) vulnerability assessments that identify the sensitivity of the
population to such exposures and the capacity of the population to cope
with and recover from them (see below and Sections 2.6.2 and 4.4); and
3) damage assessments that determine direct and indirect losses
from particular events (either ex-post in real events or ex-ante through
modeling of hypothetical events) (described in Section 5.5.2; see
Section 4.5.1). Each of these plays a part in understanding the hazard
vulnerability of a particular locale or characterizing not only who is at risk
but also the driving forces behind the differences in disaster vulnerabilities
in local places.

insurance, those incurring losses may employ diverse non-insurance

"CBA responses provide increased participation and recognition of the
local context, which is important when adapting to climate change (see
Box 5-7). The need for coordinated collective action was seen in
Kampala, where land cover change and changing climate are increasing
the frequency and severity of urban flooding and existing response
activities are uncoordinated and consist of clearing drainage channels
(Douglas et al., 2009). However, residents felt more could be done to
adapt to frequent flooding, including increasing awareness of roles and
responsibilities in averting floods, improving the drainage system,
improving garbage and solid waste disposal, strengthening the building
inspection unit, and enforcing bylaws on the construction of houses and
sanitation facilities. Similarly, in Accra, residents felt that municipal laws
on planning and urban design need to be enforced, suggesting that
strong links are needed between community responses and municipal

"Examples of community-based approaches illustrate some of the
processes involved. In northern Bangladesh, a flooding adaptation project
helped to establish early warning committees within villages that linked
to organizations outside the community, with which they did not usually
interact and that had historically blocked collective action and resource
distribution (Ensor and Berger, 2009). Through this revised governance
structure, the building of small roads, digging culverts, and planting
trees to alleviate flood impacts was facilitated. In Portland, Oregon,
another project involved a range of actors to reduce the impact of urban
heat islands through engaging neighborhoods and linking them to
experts to install green roofs, urban vegetation, and fountains that led
to an increased sense of ownership in the improvements (Ebi, 2008). In
the Philippines, the community-based approach enabled a deeper
understanding of locally specific vulnerability than in previous disaster
management contexts (Allen, 2006). While individually important, these
community-based approaches should be viewed as part of a wider
system that recognizes the drivers at multiple scales, including the
municipalities and national levels.

"Community-based adaptation (CBA) empowers communities to decide
how they want to prepare for climate risks and coordinate community
action to achieve adaptation to climate change (Ebi, 2008). Part of this
entails community risk assessment for climate change adaptation that
assesses the hazards, vulnerabilities, and capacities of the community
(van Aalst et al., 2008), which has also been called community-based
disaster preparedness among other names. The intention is to foster
active participation in collecting information that is rooted in the
communities and enables affected people to participate in their own
assessment of risk and identify responses than can enhance resilience
by strengthening social-institutional measures including social relations
(Allen, 2006; Patifio and Gauthier, 2009). In assessing short- and long-
term risks, the needs of vulnerable groups are often excluded (Douglas
et al., 2009). The tools for engaging vulnerable groups in the process
include transect walks and risk maps that capture the climate-related
hazards and risks and storylines about possible future climate change
impacts (Ebi, 2008; van Aalst et al., 2008; Patifio and Gauthier, 2009),
although these tools often require input from participants external to
the community who have long-term climate information.

"Households in disaster-prone slum areas in El Salvador spend an average
of 9.2% of their yearly income on risk management, including financing
emergency relief and recovery (Wamsler, 2007). A particularly important
informal risk-sharing mechanism is remittances, or transfers of money from
foreign workers to their home countries (discussed further in Section
7.4.4). Household savings can be accessed from a bank, but they can also
be in the form of stockpiles of food, grains, seeds, and fungible assets.
Small savings institutions can be directly impacted by catastrophes, which
can result in insufficient liquidity to handle a run on their accounts, as
occurred during the 1998 floods in Bangladesh (Kull, 2006). Lacking
sufficient savings, many disaster victims take out loans to cover their post-
disaster expenses. The interest rate (18-60%) charged on formal micro-
credit, while relatively high, generally is far below the rate (120-300%)
charged by local moneylenders (Linnerooth-Bayer and Mechler, 2009).

tisk information, disaster preparation, and disaster mitigation. Where
insurance is applied without adequate risk reduction, it can be a
disincentive for adaptation, as individuals may rely on insurance to
manage their risks and are left overly exposed to impacts (Rao and
Hess, 2009; see Section 5.4.1). Furthermore, insurance can provide the
necessary financial security to take on productive but risky investments
(Héppe and Gurenko, 2006). Examples include a pilot project in Malawi
where micro-insurance is bundled with loans that enable farmers to access

apparent that the local organization was also an important vehicle for social change in the wider community (Oettlé et al., 2004). The
Heiveld became a repository and source of local and scientific knowledge related to sustainable rooibos production. Following a severe
drought (2003-2005) and a perceived increase in weather variability, the Heiveld farmers decided to monitor the local climate and to
discuss seasonal forecasts and possible strategies in quarterly climate change preparedness workshops. These workshops are facilitated
in collaboration with two local NGOs (Indigo and Environmental Monitoring Group). They are also supported by scientists to address
farmers’ questions in a participatory action research approach — to ensure that local knowledge and scientific input can be combined to
increase the resilience of local livelihoods. The Heiveld Co-operative has been an important organizational vehicle for this learning
process, strongly supported by their long-term partners, with the focus on supporting the development of possible adaptation strategies

coordination between actors, the complexity of the policy field

insurance and reinsurance capacity through new alternative risk transfer
instruments, such as index-linked securities (including catastrophe bonds

an increasingly important role in a new era of elevated catastrophe risks
(Kunreuther et al, 2009). Another approach is to reduce risks through
societal adaptation (Herweijer et al., 2009), and risk communication and
financial incentives from insurers (Ward et al., 2008). For example,
Lloyds of London (2008) demonstrated that in exposed coastal regions,
increases in average annual losses and extreme losses due to sea level

insurance pilots, although simulation games and other innovative
communication approaches are yielding promising results (Patt et al.,

communities or regions (co-variant risks), and because of this insurers
must be prepared for meeting large claims all at once, with the cost of
requisite backup capital potentially raising the premium far above the
client's expected losses — or budget. While valuable in reducing the

How do short-term adjustments or coping strategies enable or constrain
long-term vulnerabilities in localities? What are the tradeoffs among
decision acceptability versus decision quality, especially within local

places; how local places currently cope with disasters such as emergency
assistance and disaster relief; and how they anticipate and plan for future
disaster risk using improved communication, structures such as dams and
levees, land use management and ecosystem protection, and storage of
resources. The role of scale and context shapes variability in building
adaptive capacity at the local level. Differences in coping and risk
management also are scale-dependent and context-specific, and could
affect or limit adaptations to climate extremes at the local level. Lastly,
climate extremes threaten human security at the local level. Localized
vulnerability attributed to social, economic, environmental, and climate
change drivers at a variety of scales heightens the impacts of climate
extremes on local places. While some places have considerable experience
with disasters and some inherent capacity to cope with climate extremes,
others do not. These differences in coping and management necessitate

adaptation, thus attention to a broader set of national and international
contexts relating to social welfare, quality of life, and sustainable livelihoods.

4) Multi-way information exchange systems — effective adaptation will
always be locally driven. Communities need reliable measurements
and assessment tools, integrated information about risks that those
tools reveal, and best approaches to minimize those risks. The goal is
to improve the assessment and transparency of risk in a geographic
place-based approach for vulnerable regions. Improving the collection
and quality control of locally based data on economic losses, disaster
and adaptation costs, and human losses (fatalities) will ensure
improved empirically based baseline assessments.

2) Maps of the decision processes for disaster mitigation, preparedness,
response, and recovery and guidance for using such decision support
tools are needed. Hazard maps developed through collaboration
between researchers and affected communities are the simplest
and often most powerful form of risk information. They capture the
likelihood and impact of a peril and are important for informing
many aspects of disaster risk management including disaster risk
reduction, risk-based pooling of resources, and risk transfer. Such
devices would identify segments of threatened social systems that
could suffer disproportionate disaster impacts; critical actors at each
jurisdictional level; their risk assumptions; their different types of
information needs; and the design of an information infrastructure
that would support decisions at critical entry points (Comfort, 1993).

"3) People who face hazards often need assistance to manage their
own environments over the long term and develop systematic
actions to improve resilience in vulnerable localities. Research is
needed on how local governments and institutions can support,
provide incentives, and legitimize successful approaches to
increasing capacity and action.

4) Methodologies, indicators, and measurement of progress in reducing
vulnerability and enhancing community capacity at the local level
are under-researched at present. Locally based risk management,
cost-effectiveness methodologies and analyses, quantification of
societal impacts of catastrophic events at local to national scales,
and research on implementation and evaluation of risk management
and mitigation programs are needed. Similarly, there is a critical
need for the assessment and coordination of multi-jurisdictional
and multi-sectoral efforts to help avoid the unintended consequences
of actions and interventions especially at the local scale.

5) Underserved people require access to the social and economic
security that comes from sharing risk, through financial risk transfer
mechanisms such as insurance. There is a paucity of studies at the
local level to assess the efficacy of alternative risk reduction, risk-
based resource pooling and transfer methods, analysis of benefits
and costs to various stakeholder groups, analysis of complementary
roles of mitigation and insurance, and analysis of safeguards
against insurance industry insolvency.

"In the majority of countries, national systems have been strengthened by applying the principles of the

greater efforts are required to address the underlying drivers of risk and generate the political will to
invest in disaster risk reduction (high agreement, robust evidence). The Hyogo Framework for Action has

"This chapter assesses how countries are managing current and projected disaster risks, given knowledge of how risks
are changing with observations and projections of weather and climate extremes [Table 3-2, 3.3], vulnerability and
exposure [4.3], and impacts [4.4]. It focuses on the design of national systems for managing such risks, the roles
played by actors involved in the system, and the functions they perform, acknowledging that complementary actions
to manage risks are also taken at local and international level as described in Chapters 5 and 7.
"	Text
"In providing such public goods, governments choose to manage disaster risk by enabling national systems
to guide and support stakeholders to reduce risk where possible, transfer risk where feasible, and manage
residual risk, recognizing that risks can never be totally eliminated (high agreement, robust evidence). The
balance between reducing risk and other disaster risk management strategies is influenced by a range of factors,
including financial and technical capacity of stakeholders, robustness of risk assessment information, and cultural
elements involving risk tolerance. [6.2.1, 6.2-6.5]
"	Text
"National systems are at the core of countries’ capacity to meet the challenges of observed and projected
trends in exposure, vulnerability, and weather and climate extremes (high agreement, robust evidence).
Effective national systems comprise multiple actors from national and sub-national governments, private sector,
research bodies, and civil society, including community-based organizations, playing differential but complementary
roles to manage risk according to their accepted functions and capacities. These actors work in partnership across
temporal, spatial, administrative, and social scales, supported by relevant scientific and traditional knowledge. Specific
characteristics of national systems vary between countries and across scales depending on their socio-cultural, political,
and administrative environments and development status. [6.2]
"	Text
"The ability of governments to implement disaster risk management responsibilities differs significantly
across countries, depending on their capacity and resource constraints (high agreement, robust evidence).
Smaller or economically less-diversified countries face particular challenges in providing the public goods associated
with disaster risk management, in absorbing the losses caused by climate extremes and disasters, and in providing
relief and reconstruction assistance. [6.4.3] However, there is limited evidence to suggest any correlation between the
type of governance system in a country (e.g., centralized or decentralized; unitary or federal) and the effectiveness of
disaster risk management efforts. There is robust evidence and high agreement to suggest that actions generated
within and managed by communities with supporting government policies are generally most effective since they are
specific and tailored to local environments. [6.4.2]
"	Text
"The national level plays a key role in governing and managing disaster risks because national government
is central to providing risk management-related public goods as it commonly maintains financial and
organizational authority in planning and implementing these goods (high agreement, robust evidence).
National governments are charged with the provision of public goods such as ensuring the economic and social well-
being, safety, and security of their citizens from disasters, including the protection of the poorest and most vulnerable
citizens. They also control budgetary allocations as well as creating legislative frameworks to guide actions by other
actors. Often, national governments are considered to be the ‘insurer of last resort’. In line with the delivery of public
goods, national governments and public authorities ‘own’ a large part of current and future disaster risks (public
infrastructure, public assets, and relief spending). In terms of managing risk, national governments act as risk
aggregators and by pooling risk, hold a large portfolio of public liabilities. This provides governments responsibility to
accurately quantify and manage risks associated with this portfolio — functions that are expected to become more
important given projected impacts of climate change and trends in vulnerability and exposure. [6.2.1]

attention on disaster risk reduction compared to more reactive measures. This has included improvements in coordination
between actors, enhanced early warning and preparedness, more rigorous risk assessments, and increased awareness.
However, there is limited evidence and low agreement to suggest improvements in integration between efforts to

"While there is robust evidence and high agreement on efforts to tackle current disaster risks, the assessment
found limited evidence of national disaster risk management systems and associated risk management
measures explicitly integrating knowledge of and uncertainties in projected changes in exposure,
vulnerability, and climate extremes. The effectiveness of efforts to manage projected disaster risks at the national
level are dependent on a range of factors, including the effectiveness of the system for managing current risks, the
ability of the system to flexibly respond to new knowledge, the availability of suitable data, and the resources available
to invest in longer-term risk reduction and adaptation measures. Developed countries are better equipped financially
and institutionally to adopt explicit measures to effectively respond and adapt to projected changes in exposure,
vulnerability, and climate extremes than developing countries. Nonetheless, all countries face challenges in assessing,
understanding, and then responding to such projected changes. [6.3.2, 6.6]

"Measures that provide benefits under current climate and a range of future climate change scenarios,
called low-regrets measures, are available starting points for addressing projected trends in exposure,
vulnerability, and climate extremes. They have the potential to offer benefits now and lay the foundation
for addressing projected changes (high agreement, medium evidence). The assessment considered such ‘low’
regrets options across a range of key sectors, with some of the most commonly cited measures associated with
improvements to early warning systems, health surveillance, water supply, sanitation, and drainage systems; climate
proofing of major infrastructure and enforcement of building codes; better education and awareness; and restoration
of degraded ecosystems and nature conservation. Many of these low-regrets strategies produce co-benefits; help
address other development goals, such as improvements in livelihoods, human well-being, and biodiversity conservation;
and help minimize the scope for maladaptation. [6.3.1, Table 6-1]

"high agreement, robust evidence). Systems to manage current disaster risk are more successful if:

Risks are recognized as dynamic and are mainstreamed and integrated into development policies, strategies, and
actions, and into environmental management. [6.3.1]

Legislation for managing disaster risks is supported by clear regulations that are effectively enforced across
scales and complemented by other sectoral development and management legislations where risk considerations
are explicitly integrated. [6.4.1]

Disaster risk management functions are coordinated across sectors and scales and led by organizations at the
highest political level. [6.4.2]

They include considerations of disaster risk in national development and sector plans, and, if they adopt climate
change adaptation strategies, translating these plans and strategies into actions targeting vulnerable areas and
groups. [6.5.2]

Risk is quantified and factored into national budgetary processes, and a range of measures including budgeting for
relief expenditure, reserve funds, and other forms of risk financing have been considered or implemented. [6.4.3]
Decisions are informed by comprehensive information about observed changes in weather, climate, and vulnerability
and exposure, and historic disaster losses, using a diversity of readily available tools and guidelines. [6.5.1]

Early warning systems deliver timely, relevant, and accurate predictions of hazards, and are developed and made
operational in partnership with the public and trigger effective response actions. [6.5.1]

Strategies include a combination of hard infrastructure-based options responses and soft solutions such as
individual and institutional capacity building and ecosystem-based responses, including conservation measures
associated with, for example, forestry, river catchments, coastal wetlands, and biodiversity. [6.5.2]

"Ecosystem-based solutions in the context of changing climate risks can offer ‘triple-win’ solutions, as they
can provide cost-effective risk reduction, support biodiversity conservation, and enable improvements in
economic livelihoods and human well-being, particularly for the poor and vulnerable (high agreement,
robust evidence). The assessment found that such ecosystem-based adaptation strategies, including mangrove
conservation and rehabilitation, integrated catchment management, and sustainable forest and fisheries management,
also minimize the scope for maladaptation in developed and developing countries. In choosing amongst ecosystem-
based adaptation options, decisionmakers may need to make tradeoffs between particular climate risk reduction
strategies and other valued ecosystem services. [6.5.2]

"Pooling of risk by and between national governments contributes to reducing the fiscal and socioeconomic
consequences of disasters (medium agreement, medium evidence). As national governments hold a large
portfolio of public liabilities (infrastructure, public assets, and the provision of disaster relief), risk aggregation and
pooling are expected to become more important given projected impacts of climate change and trends in vulnerability
and exposure. In addition, particularly for small, low-income, and highly exposed countries, risk transfer of public sector
assets and relief expenditure recently have become a cornerstone of disaster risk reduction. Key innovative and promising
applications recently implemented comprise sovereign insurance for hurricane risk, insurance for humanitarian assistance
following droughts, and intergovernmental risk pooling. [6.4.3, 6.5.3]

absorb the losses from disasters; but their uptake is unequally distributed across regions and hazards, and
often public-private partnerships are required (high agreement, robust evidence). Disaster insurance and
other risk transfer instruments covered about 20% of reported weather-related losses over the period 1980 to 2003.
Distribution, though, is uneven, with about 40% of the losses insured in high-income as compared to 4% of losses in
low-income countries. Existing national insurance systems differ widely as to whether policies are compulsory or
voluntary, and importantly in how systems allocate liability and responsibility for disaster risks across society. With
changing weather and extreme events, vulnerability, and exposure, extended and innovative private-public sector
partnerships are required to better estimate and price risk as well as to develop robust insurance-related products,
which may be supported in developing countries by development partner funds. [6.5.3]

"Flexible and adaptive national systems are better suited to manage projected trends and associated
uncertainties in exposure, vulnerability, and weather and climate extremes than static and rigid national
systems (high agreement, limited evidence). Adaptive management brings together different scientific, social, and
economic information, experiences, and traditional knowledge into decisionmaking through ‘learning by doing.’ Multi-
criteria analysis, scenario planning, and flexible decision paths offer options for taking action when faced with large
uncertainties or incomplete information. National systems for managing disaster risk can adapt to climate change and
shifting exposure and vulnerability by (i) frequently assessing and mainstreaming knowledge of dynamic risks;

(ii) adopting ‘low regrets’ strategies; (iii) improving learning and feedback across disaster, climate, and development
organizations at all scales; (iv) addressing the root causes of poverty and vulnerability; (v) screening investments for
climate change-related impacts and risks to minimize scope for maladaptation; and (vi) increasing standing capacity

high exposure to disaster risk, a growing body of literature has shown
significant adverse effects in developing countries (Otero and Marti,

ECLAC, 2002, 2003; Mechler, 2004; Hochrainer, 2006; Noy, 2009). These

"to other shocks (Owens et al., 2003; Lal, 2010). Consequently, disasters
are seen as barriers for development, requiring ex-ante disaster risk
reduction policies that also target poverty and development (del Ninno
et al., 2003; Owens et al., 2003; Skoufias, 2003; Benson and Clay, 2004;
Hallegatte et al., 2007; Raddatz, 2007; Cardona et al., 2010; IFRC, 2010).
However, some literature suggests that disasters may not always have
a negative effect on economic growth and development and for
some countries disasters may be regarded as a problem of, and not for
development (Albala-Bertrand, 1993; Skidmore and Toya, 2002; Caselli
and Malthotra, 2004; Hallegatte and Ghil, 2007). Disasters have also
been considered to increase economic growth in the short term as well
as spur positive economic growth and technological renewal in the
longer term, depending on the domestic capacity of nations to rebuild
and the inflow of international assistance (Skidmore and Toya, 2002).
This observation may be partially attributable to national accounting
practices, which positively record reconstruction efforts but do not
account for the immediate destruction of assets and wealth in some
cases (Skidmore and Toya, 2002).
"	Text
"To better respond to the impacts of disasters on human livelihoods,
environment, and economies, national disaster risk management systems
have evolved in recent years, guided in some cases by international
instruments, particularly the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) 2005-2015
and more recently as part of the adaptation agenda under the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC; see
Section 7.3). Increasing knowledge, understanding, and experiences in
dealing with disaster risks have gradually contributed to a paradigm
shift globally that recognizes the importance of reducing risks by
addressing underlying drivers of vulnerability and exposure, such as
targeting poverty, improving human well-being, better environmental
management, and adaptation to climate change as well as responding
to and rebuilding after disaster events (Yodmani, 2001; IFRC, 2004,
2010; Thomalla et al., 2006; UNISDR, 2008a; Venton and LaTrobe, 2008;
Pelham et al., 2011). While governments cannot act alone, the majority
are well placed and equipped to support communities and the private
sector to address disaster risks. Yet recent reported experiences suggest
that countries vary considerably in their responses, and concerns remain
about the lack of integration of disaster risk management into sustainable
development policies and planning as well as insufficient implementation
at different levels (CCCD, 2009; UNFCCC, 2008b).
"	Text
"The socioeconomic impacts of disaster events can be significant in all
countries, but low- and middle-income countries are especially vulnerable,
and experience higher fatalities even when exposed to hazards of similar
magnitude (O'Brien et al., 2006; Thomalla et al., 2006; Ibarraran et al.,
2009; IFRC, 2010). The number of deaths per cyclone event in the last
several decades, for example, was highest in low-income countries even
though a higher proportion of population exposed to cyclones lives in
countries with higher income; 11% of the people exposed to hazards
live in low human development countries, but they account for more
than 53% of the total recorded deaths resulting from disasters (UNDP,
2004a). At the same time, while in absolute terms the direct economic
losses from disasters are far greater in high-income countries, middle-
and low-income states bear the heaviest burden of these costs in terms
of damage relative to annual gross domestic product (GDP: UNDP,
2004a; DFID, 2005; O'Brien et al., 2006; Kellenberg et al., 2008; Pelham
et al., 2011). This burden has been increasing in the middle-income
countries, where the asset base is rapidly expanding and losses over the
period from 2001 to 2006 amounted to about 1% of GDP. For the low-
income group, losses totaled an average of 0.3% and for the high-
income countries amounted to less than 0.1% of GDP (Cummins and
Mahul, 2009). In some particularly exposed countries, including many
small island developing states, these wealth losses expressed as a
percentage of GDP can be considerably higher, with the average costs
over disaster and non-disaster years close to 10%, such as reported for
Grenada and St. Lucia (World Bank and UN, 2010). In extreme cases, the
costs of individual events can be as high as 200% of the annual GDP as
experienced in the Polynesian island nation of Niue following cyclone
Heta in 2004, or in the Hurricane Ivan event affecting Grenada in 2004
(McKenzie et al., 2005).

surpass people and businesses’ coping capacity (OAS, 1991; Otero and
Marti, 1995; Benson and Clay, 2002a,b). National governments are also
better placed to appreciate key uncertainties and risks and take
strategic actions, particularly based on their power of taxation (see
Sections 6.4.3 and 6.5.3), although particularly exposed developing
countries may be financially challenged to attend to the risks and
liabilities imposed by natural disasters (Mechler, 2004; Cummins and

"Recent global assessments of disaster risk management point to a
general lack of integration of disaster risk management into sustainable
development policies and planning across countries and regions,
although progress has been made especially in terms of passing
legislation, in setting up early warning systems, and in strengthening
disaster preparedness and response (Amendola et al., 2008; UNISDR,
2011b; Wisner, 2011). Closing the gap between current provision and
what is needed for tackling even current climate variability and disaster
tisk is a priority for national risk management systems and is also a crucial
aspect of countries’ responses to projected climate change. With a history
of managing climatic extremes, involving a large number of experienced
actors across scales and levels of government and widespread instances
of supporting legislation and cross-sectoral coordinating bodies
(Section 6.4.2), national disaster risk management systems offer a
promising avenue for supporting adaptation to climate change and
reducing projected climate-related disaster risks.
"	Text
"Changes in weather and climate extremes and related impacts pose
new challenges for national disaster risk management systems, which
in many instances remain poorly adapted to the risks posed by existing
climatic variability and extremes (Lavell, 1998; McGray et al., 2007;
Venton and La Trobe, 2008; Mitchell et al., 2010b). Nonetheless, valuable
lessons for advancing adaptation to climate change can be drawn from
existing national disaster risk management systems (McGray et al., 2007;
Mitchell et al, 2010b). Such national systems are comprised of actors
operating across scales, fulfilling a range of roles and functions, guided
by an enabling environment of institutions, international agreements,
and experience of previous disasters (Carter, 1992; Freeman et al., 2003).
These systems vary considerably between countries in terms of their
capacities and effectiveness and in the way responsibilities are distributed
between actors. Countries also put differential emphasis on integration
of disaster risk management with development processes and tackling
vulnerability and exposure, compared with preparing for and responding
to extreme events and disasters (Cardona et al., 2010).
"	Text
"Managing climate-related disaster risks is a concern of multiple actors,
working across scales from international, national, and sub-national and
community levels, and often in partnership, to ultimately help individuals,
households, communities, and societies to reduce their risks (Twigg,
2004; Schipper, 2009; Wisner, 2011). Comprising national and sub-
national governments, the private sector, research bodies, civil society,
and community-based organizations and communities, effective national
systems would ideally have each actor performing to their accepted
functions and capacities. Each actor would play differential but
complementary roles across spatial and temporal scales (UNISDR,
2008a; Schipper, 2009; Miller et al, 2010) and would draw on a mixture
of scientific and local knowledge to shape their actions and their
appreciation of the dynamic nature of risk (see Figure 6-1). Given that
national systems are at the core of a country’s capacity to meet the
challenges of observed and projected trends in exposure, vulnerability,
and weather and climate extremes, this section assesses the literature
on the roles played by different actors working within such national
systems.

"country challenges, the assessment reflects on the adequacy of existing
knowledge, policies, and practices globally and considers the extent to
which the current disaster risk management systems may need to
evolve to deal with the uncertainties associated with and the effects of
climate change on disaster risks. Section 6.2 characterizes national
systems for managing existing climate extremes and disaster risk by
focusing on the actors that help create the system — national and sub-
national government agencies, bilateral and multilateral organizations,
the private sector, research agencies, civil society, and community-based
organizations. Drawing on a range of examples from developed and
developing countries, Sections 6.3 through 6.5 describe what is known
about the status of managing current and future risk, what is desirable
in an effective national system for adapting to climate change, and what
gaps in knowledge exist. The latter parts of the chapter are organized
by the set of functions undertaken by the actors discussed in Section 6.2.
The functions are divided into three main categories — those associated
with planning and policies (Section 6.3), strategies (Section 6.4), and
practices, including methods and tools (Section 6.5), for reducing
climatic risks. Section 6.6 reflects on how national systems for managing
climate extremes and disaster risk can become more closely aligned to
the challenges posed by climate change and development — particularly
those associated with uncertainty, changing patterns of risk and
exposure, and the impacts of climate change on vulnerability and
poverty. Aspects of Section 6.6 are further elaborated in Chapter 8.

also in response to uncertainties and changing needs due to increases

reserves, National-level governments also redistribute income across
members of society and thus are called upon when those are in need
(Linnerooth-Bayer and Amendola, 2000), or when members of society
are in danger of becoming poor, and in need of relief payments to
sustain a basic standard of living, especially in countries with low per

governments are expected to stabilize the economy, for example, by

"The national level plays a key role in governing and managing disaster
risks because national governments are central to providing risk
management-related public goods as they maintain organizational and
financial authority in planning and providing such goods. National
governments have the moral and legal responsibility to ensure
economic and social well-being, including safety and security of their
citizens from disasters (UNISDR, 2004). It is also argued that it is
government's responsibility to protect the poorest and most vulnerable
citizens from disasters, and to implement disaster risk management that
reaches all (McBean, 2008; O’Brien et al., 2008; CCCD, 2009). In terms
of risk ownership, government and public disaster authorities ‘own’ a
large part of current and future extreme event risks and are expected to
govern and regulate risks borne by other parts of society (Mechler,
2004). Various normative literature sources support this. As one
example, literature on economic welfare theory suggests that national
governments are exposed to natural disaster risk and potential losses
due to their three main functions: provision of public goods and services

addressing drivers of vulnerability and managing the risk of extreme

to guide, build, and develop policy, regulatory, and institutional
frameworks that prioritize risk management (Handmer and Dovers, 2007;
UNISDR, 2008b; OECD, 2009); integrate disaster risk management with
other policy domains like development or environmental management,
which often are separated in different ministries (UNISDR 2004, 2009c;

vulnerability and assist the most vulnerable populations (McBean, 2008;

public goods and services that help address drivers of vulnerability as

"The private sector plays a small, but increasingly important role in
disaster risk management and adaptation, and some aspects of disaster
risk management may be suitable for nongovernmental stakeholders to
implement, albeit this would often effectively be coordinated within a
framework created and enabled by governments. Three avenues for private
sector engagement may be identified: (1) corporate social responsibility
(CSR); (2) public-private partnerships (PPP); and (3) businesses model
approaches. CSR involves voluntary advocacy and raising awareness by
businesses for disaster risk reduction as well as involving funding
support and the contribution of volunteers and expertise to implement
risk management measures. PPPs focus on enhancing the provision of
public goods for disaster risk reduction in joint undertakings between
public and private sector players. The business model approach pursues
the integration and alignment of disaster risk reduction with operational
and strategic goals of an enterprise (Warhurst, 2006; Roeth, 2009).
While CSR and PPP have received substantial attention, business model
approaches remain rather untouched areas, one very important exception
being the insurance industry as a supplier of tools for transferring and
sharing disaster risks and losses.

"Professional societies (such as builders and architects) and trade
associations also play a key role in developing and implementing
standards and practices for disaster risk reduction. These practices may
include national and international standards and model building codes
that are adopted in the regulations of local, state, and national
governments. Although the potential for private sector players in
disaster risk reduction in sectors such as engineering and construction,
information communication technology, media and communication, as
well as utilities and transportation seems large, limited evidence of
successful private sector activity has been documented, owing to a
number of reasons (Roeth, 2009). The business case for private sector
involvement in disaster risk reduction remains unclear, hampering private
sector engagement. Companies may also be averse to reporting activities
that are fundamental to their business; and, in more community-
focused projects, companies often work with local nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs) and do not often report such efforts. Considering
climate variability and change within the business model, companies may
be an important entry point for disaster risk reduction, particularly in
terms of guaranteeing global value chains in the presence of potentially
large-scale disruptions triggered by climate-related disasters. For example,

"In terms of business model approaches, insurance is a key sector. In
exchange for pre-disaster premium payments, disaster insurance and
other risk transfer instruments in 2010 covered about 30% of disaster
losses overall (Munich Re, 2011). In terms of weather-related events, for
the period 1980 to 2003, insurance overall covered about 20% of the
losses, yet the distribution according to country income groups is
uneven, with about 40% of the losses insured in high-income as
compared to 4% in low-income countries (Mills, 2007). In developing
countries, despite complexities and uncertainties involved in both
supply and demand for risk transfer, risk financing mechanisms have
been found to demonstrate substantial potential for absorbing the
financial burden of disasters (Pollner, 2000; Andersen, 2001; Varangis et
al. 2002; Auffret, 2003; Dercon, 2005; Hess and Syroka, 2005;
Linnerooth-Bayer et al., 2005; Skees et al, 2005; World Bank, 2007;
Cummins and Mahul, 2009; Hazell and Hess, 2010). There is, though,
some uncertainty as to the extent to which the private sector would
continue to play this role in the context of a changing environment due
to uncertainty and imperfect information, missing and misaligned
markets, and financial constraints (Smit et al., 2001; Aakre et al., 2010).
Private insurers are concerned about changes in risks and associated risk
ambiguity, that is, the uncertainty about the changes induced by climate
change in terms of potentially modified extreme event intensity and
frequency. Accordingly, as climate change, and other drivers such as
changes in vulnerability and exposure (see Chapters 1, 2, and 3), are
projected to lead to changes in frequency and intensity of some
weather risks and extremes, insurers may be less prepared to underwrite
insurance for extreme event risks. Innovative private-public sector
partnerships may thus be required to better estimate and price risk as
well as develop robust insurance-related products, which may be
supported in developing countries by development partner funds as
well (see Section 6.5.3 and Case Study 9.2.13).

2008; Practical Action Bangladesh, 2008; SEEDS India, 2008; Tearfund,
2008; World Vision, 2008); sustaining commitment to work with local
governments and stakeholders over the long term and maintaining
partnerships with local authorities (Oxfam America, 2008); and
coordinating and linking local-level efforts with sub-national government
initiatives and national plans during the specific project implementation
(SEEDS India, 2008), they are particularly well positioned to draw links
between disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation given
that such organizations are currently among the few to combine such
expertise (Mitchell et al., 2010b).

"Bilateral and multilateral agencies have been key actors in advancing
mainstreaming of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation
into development planning (Eriksen and Neess, 2003; Klein et al., 2007;
see Section 6.3). This has primarily been driven by a concern that
development investments are increasingly exposed to climate- and
disaster-related risks and that climate change poses security concerns
(Harris, 2009; Persson and Klein, 2009). As a result, such agencies are
influencing development policy and implementation at a national level
as they require disaster and climate risk assessments and environmental
screening to be conducted at different points in the project approval
process and in some cases retrospectively when projects are already
underway (Klein et al., 2007; OECD, 2009; Hammill and Tanner, 2010). A
range of tools and methods have been developed, primarily by bilateral
and multilateral agencies, to support such processes (Klein et al., 2007;
Hammill and Tanner, 2010).

"At the national level, civil society organizations (CSOs) and community-
based organizations (CBOs) play a significant role in developing initiatives
to respond to disasters, reduce the risk of disasters, and, recently, adapt
to climate-related hazards (see Section 5.1 for a discussion of ‘local’ and
‘community’ and Section 5.4.1 for the role of CBOs at the local level).
CSOs and CBOs are referred to here as the wide range of associations
around which society voluntarily organizes itself, with CBO referring to
those associations primarily concerned with local interests and ties. CSO
and CBO initiatives in the field of disaster risk management, which may
usually begin as a humanitarian concern, often evolve to also embrace
the broader challenge of disaster risk reduction following community-
focused risk assessment, including specific activities targeting education
and advocacy; environmental management; sustainable agriculture;
infrastructure construction; and increased livelihood diversification
(McGray et al., 2007; CARE International, 2008; Oxfam America, 2008;
Practical Action Bangladesh, 2008; SEEDS India, 2008; Tearfund, 2008;
World Vision, 2008).

"In developing countries, particularly where the government is weak and
has limited resources, bilateral and multilateral agencies play a
significant role in supplying financial, technical, and in some cases
strategic support to government and nongovernment agencies to
tackle the multifaceted challenges of disaster risk management and
climate change adaptation in the context of national development
goals (e.g., AusAid, 2009; DFID, 2011). Multilateral agencies are referred
to here as international institutions with governmental membership
that have a significant focus on development and aid recipient countries.
Such agencies can include United Nations agencies, regional groupings
(e.g., some European Union agencies), and multilateral development
banks (e.g., World Bank, Asian Development Bank). Bilateral agencies
(e.g., United Kingdom Department for International Development) are
taken here as national institutions that focus on the relationship
between one government and another. In the development sphere,
this is often in the context of a richer government providing support
to a poorer government. The role of international institutions,
including bilateral and multilateral agencies, is discussed extensively in
Section 7.3.

"Recently in some high-risk regions there has been rapid development of
national platforms of CSOs and CBOs that have been working together
in order to push for the transformation of policies and practices related
to disaster risk reduction. This is true in the case of Central America,
where at least four platforms are functioning in the same number of
countries, involving more than 120 CSOs and CBOs (CRGR, 2007a). The
efforts of these platforms have been aimed at advocacy, training,
research, and capacity building in disaster risk reduction. In Central
America, the experience is that advocacy on climate policy construction
has become a new feature of such platforms since 2007 (CRGR, 2009).
While beyond the scope of this chapter, on balance the majority of CSOs
and CBOs focus efforts at the local level, trying to link disaster risk
management with local development goals associated with water,
sanitation, education, and health, for example (GNDR 2009; Lavell,
2009). Faith-based organizations are also influential in assisting local
communities in disaster risk management, not only providing pastoral
care in times of disasters but also playing an important role in raising
awareness and training, with many international development partners
often working with local church groups to build community resilience
(see, for example, ADPC 2007; Gero et al., 2011; Tearfund, 2011).

"The effectiveness of national systems for managing climate extremes and
disaster risks is highly dependent on the availability and communication
of robust and timely scientific data and information (Sperling and
Szekely, 2005; Thomalla et al., 2006; CACCA, 2010) and traditional
knowledge (Mercer et al., 2007; Kelman et al., 2011; see Box 5-7) to inform
not only community-based decisions and policymakers who manage
national approaches to disaster risk and climate change adaptation, but
also researchers who provide further analytical information to support
such decisions.
"	Text
"While significant progress has been made in developing appropriate
tools and methods for assessing and screening risk, many bilateral and
multilateral agencies continue to address disaster risk management and
climate change adaptation separately, and link with respective regional
and national agencies in the context of distinct international instruments
(Mitchell and Van Aalst, 2008; Mitchell et al., 2010b; Gero et al., 2011).
However, recent assessments suggest that the situation is improving,
partially attributable to the process of authoring this Special Report and
in the focus on risk management in the text of the Bali Action Plan
(2007) and Cancun Agreement (2010) (Mitchell et al., 2010b; see
Section 7.3.2.2 for more detail).

"Given that learning will come from doing and in spite of differences,
there are many ways that countries can learn from each other in
prioritizing their climate and disaster risks; in mainstreaming climate
change adaptation and disaster risk management into plans, policies,
and processes for development; and in securing additional financial and
human resources needed to meet increasing demands (UNDP, 2002;
Thomalla et al., 2006; Schipper, 2009). This subsection will address
frameworks for national disaster risk management and climate change
adaptation planning and policies (Section 6.3.1), the mainstreaming of
plans and policies nationally (Section 6.3.2), and the various sectoral
disaster risk management and climate change adaptation options
available for national systems (Section 6.3.3), recognizing the range of
actors engaged in these processes as described in Section 6.2.
"	Text
"Disaster practitioners largely focus on making use of short-term weather
forecasting and effective dissemination and communication of hazard
information and responses (Thomalla et al., 2006). Such climate change
expertise can typically be found in meteorological agencies, environment
or energy departments, and in academic institutions (Sperling and Szekely,
2005), while disaster risk assessments have been at the core of many
multilateral and civil society organizations and national disaster
management authorities (Sperling and Szekely, 2005; Thomalla et al.,
2006). Although progress has been reported in the communication and
availability of scientific information, there is still a lack of, for example,
sufficient local or sub-national data on hazards and risk assessments to
underpin area-specific disaster risk management (Chung, 2009; UNISDR,
2009c).
"	Text
"The diversity of national contexts requires bilateral and multilateral
agencies to adopt different modalities to maximize the effectiveness of
technical, financial, and strategic support. For example, in the Pacific and
the Caribbean, regional bodies (e.g., the Caribbean Disaster Emergency
Management Agency) commonly operate as an intermediary, channeling
resources to island countries where it is not efficient for international
agencies to establish a permanent adaptation or risk management-
focused presence (Hay, 2009; Gero et al., 2011). In countries with weak
national institutions, bilateral and multilateral agencies commonly choose
to channel resources through civil society organizations with the intention
of ensuring that resources reach the poorest and most vulnerable
(Wickham et al., 2009). In such situations, coordination between
agencies can be challenging and in certain circumstances can further
reduce the risk management capacity of government organizations
(Wickham et al., 2009). However, the broad trend is to maximize the
support to national governments by seeking to improve national ownership
of risk management and adaptation processes and in that respect
support national governments to lead national systems (GFDRR, 2010;
DFID, 2011).

"The complexity and diversity of adaptation to climate change situations
implies that there can be no single recommended approach for assessing,
planning, and implementing adaptation options (Fiissel, 2007; Hammill
and Tanner, 2010; Lu, 2011). When the planning horizons are short and
adaptation decisions only impact the next one or two decades, adaptation
to recent climate variability and observed trends may be sufficient
(Hallegatte, 2009; Wilby and Dessai, 2010; Lu, 2011). For long-lasting
risks and decisions, the timing and sequencing of adaptation options
and incorporation of climate change scenarios become increasingly
important (Hallegatte, 2009; OECD, 2009; Wilby and Dessai, 2010).
Studies suggest that the most pragmatic adaptation and disaster risk
management options depend on the timeframes under consideration and
the adaptive capacity and ability of the country or sectoral agencies to
effectively integrate information on climate change and its uncertainties
(McGray et al., 2007; Biesbroek et al., 2010; Krysanova et al., 2010;
Wilby and Dessai, 2010; Juhola and Westerhoff, 2011). Given the various
uncertainties at decisionmaking scales, studies suggest that adaptation
actions based on information on the observed climate and its trends
may be preferable in some cases while, in other cases with long-term
irreversible decisions, climate change scenario-guided adaptation
actions will be required (Auld, 2008b; Hallegatte, 2009; OECD, 2009;

"In dealing with climate change and disaster risk uncertainties, many
national studies identify gradations or categories of adaptation and
disaster risk management planning and policy options (Dessai and Hulme,
2007; Auld, 2008b; Hallegatte, 2009; Kwadijk et al., 2010; Mastrandrea
et al, 2010; Wilby and Dessai, 2010). These gradations in options range
from climate vulnerability or resilience approaches, sometimes
described as ‘bottom-up’; vulnerability, tipping point, critical threshold, or
policy-first approaches to climate modeling, impact-based approaches,
sometimes described as ‘top-down’; model or impacts-first; science-
first; or classical approaches (as illustrated in Figure 6-2 and outlined in
the sectoral option headings of Table 6-1 and described in Section
6.3.3). Although the bottom-up and top-down terms sometimes refer to
scale, subject matter, or policy (e.g., national versus local, physical to
socioeconomic systems), the terms are used here to describe the
sequences or steps needed to develop adaptation and disaster risk
management plans and policies at the national level. When dealing with
long-term future climate change risks, the main differences between the
scenarios-impacts-first and vulnerability-thresholds-first approaches lie
in the timing or sequencing of the stages of the analyses, as shown
in Figure 6-2 (Kwadijk et al., 2010; Ranger et al., 2010). Although this
difference appears subtle, it has significant implications for the
management of uncertainty, the timing of adaptation options, and the
efficiency of the policymaking (Dessai and Hulme, 2007; Auld, 2008b;
Kwadijk et al., 2010; Wilby and Dessai, 2010; Lu, 2011). For example,

to cope with uncertainty, rather than risk maladaptation from use of

"Vulnerability thresholds-based approaches start at the level of the

consider how resilient or robust a system or sector is to changes in climate,

improve resilience and robustness under future climate scenarios
(Auld, 2008b; Urwin and Jordan, 2008; Hallegatte, 2009; Kwadijk et al.,
2010; Mastrandrea et al., 2010; Wilby and Dessai, 2010). Vulnerability-

"Vulnerability-thresholds-first approaches have sometimes been critiqued
for the time required to complete a vulnerability assessment, for their
reliance on experts, and for their largely qualitative results and limited
comparability across regions (Patt et al., 2005; Kwadijk et al., 2010).
Vulnerability-thresholds approaches can sometimes prove less suited
for guiding future adaptation decisions if coping thresholds change, or
if climate change risks emerge that are outside the range of recent
experiences (e.g., successive drought years could progressively reduce
coping thresholds of the rural poor by increasing indebtedness)
(McGray et al., 2007; Agrawala and van Aalst, 2008; Auld, 2008b;

"Options that are known as ‘no regrets’ and ‘low regrets’ provide benefits
under any range of climate change scenarios, although they may not
be optimal for every future scenario, and are recommended when
uncertainties over future climate change directions and impacts are
high (Dessai and Hulme, 2007; Auld, 2008b; Hallegatte, 2009; Kwadijk
et al., 2010). These ‘low regrets’ adaptation options typically include
improvements to coping strategies or reductions in exposure to known
threats (Auld, 2008b; Kwadijk et al., 2010; Wilby and Dessai, 2010), such
as better forecasting and warning systems, use of climate information
to better manage agriculture in drought-prone regions, flood-proofing
of homesteads, or interventions to ensure up-to-date climatic design
information for engineering projects. The vulnerability-thresholds-first
approaches are particularly useful for identifying priority areas for
action now, assessing the effectiveness of specific interventions when
current climate-related risks are not satisfactorily controlled, when
climatic stress factors are closely intertwined with non-climatic factors,
planning horizons are short, resources are very limited (ie., expertise,
data, time, and money), or uncertainties about future climate impacts
are very large (Agrawala and van Aalst, 2008; Hallegatte, 2009;
Prabhakar et al., 2009; Wilby and Dessai, 2010).
"	Text
"Increasingly, studies are recognizing that the scenarios-impacts and
vulnerability-thresholds approaches are complementary and need to be
integrated and that both can benefit from the addition of stakeholder
and scientific input to determine critical thresholds for climate change
vulnerabilities (Auld, 2008b; Haasnoot et al., 2009; Kwadijk et al., 2010;
Mastrandrea et al., 2010; Wilby and Dessai, 2010). Critical thresholds (or
adaptation tipping points) help in answering the basic adaptation
questions of decision- and policymakers — namely, what are the first
priority issues that need to be addressed as a result of increasing disaster
risks under climate change and when might these critical thresholds be
reached (Auld, 2008b; Haasnoot et al., 2009; Kwadijk et al., 2010;
Mastrandrea et al., 2010). The integration of scenarios-impacts and
vulnerability-thresholds approaches provides guidance on the sensitivity
of sectors and durability of options under different climate change
scenarios (Haasnoot et al., 2009; Kwadijk et al, 2010; Mastrandrea et
al., 2010). Integrated approaches that link changes in climate variables to
decisions and policies and express uncertainties in terms of timeframes
over which a policy or plan may be effective (i¢., roughly when will the
critical threshold be reached) also provide valuable information for
plans and policies and their implementation (Haasnoot et al., 2009;
Kwadijk et al., 2010; Mastrandrea et al., 2010).

"and risk reduction options to reduce projected risks (Kwadijk et al.,
2010; Mastrandrea et al., 2010; Wilby and Dessai, 2010). The scenarios-
impacts-first approaches are most useful to raise awareness of the
problem, to explore possible adaptation strategies, and to identify
research priorities, especially when current climate and disaster risks
can be effectively controlled, when sufficient data and resources are
available to produce state-of-the-art climate scenarios at the spatial
resolutions relevant for adaptation, and when future climate impacts
can be projected reliably (Kwadijk et al, 2010; Wilby and Dessai, 2010).
Scenarios-impacts approaches depend strongly on the chosen climate
change scenarios and downscaling techniques, as well as the assumptions
about scientific and socioeconomic uncertainties (OECD, 2009; Kwadijk
et al, 2010). Pure scenarios-impacts approaches may not be available at
the spatial scales relevant to the decisionmaker, may not be applicable
for the purpose of the decisionmaker, and usually give less consideration
to current risks from natural climate variability, to non-climatic stressors,
and to key uncertainties along with their implications for robust
adaptation policies (Fiissel, 2007; Wilby and Dessai, 2010). In practice,
there are very limited examples of actual adaptation policies being
developed and planned adaptation decisions being implemented based
on scenarios-impacts approaches only (Filssel, 2007; Biesbroek et al.,
2010; Wilby and Dessai, 2010).

"Disaster risk transfer options offer a viable adaptation response to current
and future climate risks and include instruments such as insurance,
"	Text
").3.2. _ Mainstreaming Disaster Risk Management
and Climate Change Adaptation into
Sectors and Organizations
"	Title
"Table 6-1 outlines some of the adaptation to climate change and disaster
risk management policy and planning options available nationally for
selected sectors and described in the literature. Many of these options
are incremental actions that complement and reinforce each other. The
actions are organized using the gradations of planning and policy
options described in this section.
"	Text
"National adaptation to climate change will involve stand-alone adaptation
policies and plans as well as the integration or mainstreaming of
adaptation measures into existing activities (OECD, 2009). Mainstreaming
of adaptation and disaster risk management actions implies that national,
sub-national, and local authorities adopt, expand, and enhance measures
that factor disaster and climate risks into their normal plans, policies,
strategies, programs, sectors, and organizations (Few et al., 2006; UNISDR,
2008a; OECD, 2009; Biesbroek et al., 2010; CACCA, 2010).
"	Text
"In reality, it can be challenging to provide clear pictures of what
mainstreaming is, let alone how it can be made operational, supported,
and strengthened at the various national and sub-national levels (Olhoff
and Schaer, 2010). Some studies indicate that the real challenge to
mainstreaming adaptation is not planning but implementation
(Biesbroek et al., 2010; Krysanova et al., 2010; Tompkins et al., 2010).
Some of the barriers to implementation include lack of funding, limited
budget flexibility, lack of relevant information or expertise, lack of
political will or support, and institutional silos (Krysanova et al., 2010;
"	Text
"micro-insurance, and micro-financing; government disaster reserve
funds; government-private partnerships involving risk sharing; and new,
innovative insurance mechanisms (Linnerooth-Bayer and Mechler, 2006;
EC, 2009; World Bank, 2010). Risk transfer options can provide much
needed, immediate liquidity after a disaster, allow for more effective
government response, provide some relief from the fiscal burden placed
on governments due to disaster impacts, and constitute critical steps in
promoting more proactive risk management strategies and responses
(Arnold, 2008). Case Study 9.2.13 and Section 6.5.3 provide more detail
on risk transfer options.
"	Text
"Even with risk transfer instruments and adaptation to climate change
options in place, residual losses can be realized when extreme events —
well beyond those typically expected — result in high impacts. In spite of
the evidence, decisions to ignore increasing future risks and even
current risks remain common, particularly when uncertainties over the
directions of future climate change impacts are high, when capacity is
initially very limited, adaptation options are not available, or when the
risks of future impacts are considered to be very low (Linnerooth-Bayer
and Mechler, 2006; Heltberg et al., 2009; World Bank, 2010).The losses
from deferring adaptation and disaster risk reduction actions are borne
by all actors.
"	Text
"into the future, some studies recommend the use of pro-adaptation and
robust options to deal with climate change uncertainties (Auld, 2008b;
Hallegatte, 2009; Wilby and Dessai, 2010). These robust options include
actions that are reversible, flexible, less sensitive to future climate
conditions (ie., no and low regret), and can incorporate safety margins
(eg., infrastructure investments), employ ‘soft’ solutions (e.g., ecosystem
services), and are mindful of actions being taken by others to either
reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) or adapt to climate change in other
sectors (Hallegatte, 2009; Wilby and Dessai, 2010). Flexible options are
those that provide benefits under a variety of climate conditions or
reduce stress on affected systems to increase their flexibility (e.g.,
reducing pollution or demand on resources) (Auld, 2008b; Hallegatte,
2009; Wilby and Dessai, 2010).
"	Text
"Several studies indicate that national plans and policies for adaptation
to climate change and disaster risk management tend to favor options
that deal with the current or near-term climate risks and ‘win-win’
options that satisfy multiple synergies for GHG reduction, disaster risk
management, climate change adaptation, and development issues
(World Bank, 2008; Heltberg et al., 2009; Ribeiro et al. 2009;
Fankhauser, 2010; Mitchell and Maxwell, 2010). Many of these ‘win-
win’ options include ecosystem-based adaptation actions, sustainable
land and water use planning, carbon sequestration, energy efficiency,
and energy and food self-sufficiency. For example, the ecosystem
management practices of afforestation, reforestation, and conservation of
forests offer co-benefits for disaster risk reduction from floods, landslides,
avalanches, coastal storms, and drought while contributing to adaptation
to future climates, economic opportunities, increased biomass and
carbon sequestration, energy efficiency, energy savings, as well as energy
and food self sufficiency (Thompson et al., 2009).
"	Text
"Options that allow for incremental changes in, for example, infrastructure
over time, or allow incorporation of future change, for example, support
more flexible systems (Auld, 2008b; Hallegatte, 2009; OECD, 2009).
Uncertainties over future risks can also be accounted for through ‘safety
margin’ or over-design strategies to reduce vulnerability and increase
resiliency at low and sometimes null costs (Auld, 2008b; Hallegatte, 2009).
These safety margin strategies have been used to manage future risks for
sea level rise and coastal defenses, for water drainage management,
and for investments in other infrastructure (Hallegatte, 2009). Given
uncertainties, national policies may need to become more adaptable
and flexible, particularly where national plans and policies currently
operate within a limited range of conditions and are based on certainty
(McGray et al., 2007; Wilby and Dessai, 2010). Without flexibility, rigid
national policies may become disconnected from evolving climate risks and
bring unintended consequences or maladaptation (Sperling and Szekely,
2005; Hallegatte, 2009). Rigid plans and policies that are irreversible
and based on a specific climate scenario that does not materialize can
result in future maladaptation and imply wasted investments or harm to
people and ecosystems that can prove unnecessary.
"	Text
"Preston et al., 2011). Studies indicate that effective plans, policies, and
programs for adaptation to climate change and disaster risk management
need to go beyond identifying potential options to include better
inventories of existing assets and liabilities for managing risk and
specific actions for overcoming adaptation barriers (Haasnoot et al.,
2009; Preston et al., 2011).
"	Text
"Recent studies investigating the success of existing adaptation plans
and policies for Australia, the United States, countries in Europe, and
major river basins in Africa and Asia, for example, indicate that there is
a need for mainstreaming of adaptation into existing national policies
and plans and a priority for capitalizing on ‘win-win’ or options that
take advantage of synergies with other national objectives (Biesbroek et
al., 2010; Tompkins et al., 2010; Preston et al., 2011). The studies found
that many strategies and institutions were focused to a greater extent
on lower-risk actions dealing with science and outreach (knowledge
acquisition) and capacity building rather than moving forward on
specific, more costly and difficult to implement adaptation and disaster
risk management actions and managing at-risk public goods (Tompkins
et al., 2010; Preston et al., 2011).
"	Text
"Adaptation to climate change and disaster risk management needs to
typically identify more adaptation options than most countries can
reasonably implement in the short term due to resource constraints,
requiring that actions be prioritized (OECD, 2009; Krysanova et al., 2010).
Initially, actions that remove the existing barriers to managing disaster
risks from today’s climate variability can help to reduce the even greater
barriers to managing future climate risks (UNDP, 2002, 2004a; CCCD,
2009; Prabhakar et al., 2009; Tompkins et al., 2010). As a result, a key
challenge, and an opportunity for mainstreaming adaptation and disaster
risk management, lies in building bridges between current disaster risk
management actions for existing climate vulnerabilities and the additional
revised efforts needed for future vulnerabilities (Few et al, 2006; Krysanova
et al., 2010; Olhoff and Schaer, 2010; Wilby and Dessai, 2010).
"	Text
"Preston et al. (2011) found in their studies from Australia, the United
States, and the United Kingdom that most national adaptation strategies
were based on vulnerability assessments informed by broad international
and national climate change guidance, rather than any consistent or
systematic use of scenarios, and favored bottom-up approaches for
coordination across sectors and multiple government scales. Biesbroek
et al. (2010) noted similar results for nine countries in Europe. Tompkins
et al. (2010) and Krysanova et al. (2010) found that the sectors with the
highest levels of adaptation implementation in the United Kingdom were
those that tended to be most affected by current weather variability and
extremes and that specific government initiatives had been successful
in stimulating adaptation and disaster risk reduction (e.g., mandatory
planning for flood-prone areas, ISO 14001). Tompkins et al. (2010) also
found that successful implementation frequently resulted from multiple
triggers, that few of these adaptation actions were solely initiated in
response to climate change, and that the relative impact of weather on
core business and organizational culture encouraged an ability and
willingness to proactively act on climate change information.
"	Text
"Studies generally indicate that the most essential means for effectively
mainstreaming both adaptation and disaster risk management nationally
involve ‘whole of government’ coordination across different levels and
sectors of governance, including the involvement of a broad range of
stakeholders (Few et al., 2006; Thomalla et al., 2006; OECD, 2009; also
Section 6.4.2). In spite of the strong interdependencies, governments have
tended to manage these issues in their ‘silos’ with environment or energy
authorities and scientific institutions typically responsible for climate
change adaptation while disaster risk management authorities may
reside in a variety of national government departments and national
disaster management offices (Sperling and Szekely, 2005; Thomalla et
al., 2006; Prabhakar et al., 2009). Progress in planning for adaptation and
developing and implementing strategies within government agencies
usually depends on political commitment, institutional capacity, and, in
some cases, on enabling legislation, regulations, and financial support
(Few et al., 2006; OECD, 2009; Krysanova et al., 2010; see Section 6.4).
Nationally, studies indicate that it may be important to clearly identify
a lead for disaster and climate risk reduction efforts where that lead has
influence on budgeting and planning processes (Few et al., 2006; OECD,
2009). In some cases, countries and regions may be able to build on
phases of raised awareness and increased attention to disaster risk in
order to develop and strengthen their responsible institutions (Few et
al., 2006; Krysanova et al., 2010).
"	Text
"An important prerequisite for informed decisions on adaptation to
climate change and disaster risk management is that they should be
based upon the best available information (OECD, 2009; Biesbroek et al.,
2010; Lu, 2011). Preston et al. (2011) noted that many of the specific
adaptation plans from Australia, the United States, and the United
Kingdom indicated a need for improved gathering and sharing of climate
and climate change science information prior to or in conjunction with
the delivery of adaptation actions, perhaps reflecting a preference for
delaying adaptation actions until greater certainty or better information
on different adaptation actions was known. As noted in Chapter 3
(Section 3.2.3 and Box 3-2), many extreme events occur at small
temporal and spatial scales, where climate change models, even when
downscaled, cannot provide simulations at such spatial and temporal
resolutions. A number of studies also contend that increased and better
information on climate change scenarios and projections and potential
impacts will accomplish little on their own to mainstream and alter
on-the-ground decisions, policies, and plans unless the information
provided can directly meet decisionmakers’ needs (Stainforth et al.,
2007; Auld, 2008b; Haasnoot et al., 2009; Krysanova et al., 2010;
Mastrandrea et al. 2010; Wilby and Dessai, 2010). Users require
relevant climate risk information that is accessible, can be explained in
understandable language, provides straightforward estimates of
uncertainties, and is relevant or tailored to their management
functions (Stainforth et al., 2007; Mastrandrea et al., 2010; Lu, 2011).
Increasingly, studies are showing that this is best accomplished
through sustained interactions between scientists and stakeholders and
policymakers, usually maintained through years of relationship- and
trust-building (Mastrandrea et al, 2010; Wilby and Dessai, 2010; Lu,
2011).

"multi-sector integration tends to deal with the broader national scale

possible in covering several affected sectors, regions, and issues (UNFCCC,

adaptation and risk reduction coordination between all sectors may
only be realized if all areas of government are coordinated from the
highest political and organizational level (Schipper and Pelling, 2006;
UNFCCC, 2008b; CCCD, 2009; Prabhakar, 2009). Even when ‘political

"National systems for managing the risks of extreme events and disasters
are shaped by legislative provision, compliance mechanisms, the nature
of cross-stakeholder bodies, and financial and budgetary processes that
allocate resources to actors working at different scales. These elements
help to create the technical architecture of national systems and are often
led by national government agencies. However non-technical dimensions
of good governance, such as the distribution and decentralization of
power and resources, processes for decisionmaking, transparency, and
accountability are woven into the technical architecture and are significant
factors in determining the effectiveness of risk management systems
and actions (UNDP, 2004b, 2009). These technical and non-technical
aspects of risk governance vary between countries as governance
capacity varies (and, as detailed in Section 6.3, are critical in shaping

"The challenge for countries is to manage short-term climate variability
while also ensuring that different sectors and systems remain resilient
and adaptable to changing extremes and risks over the long term
(Fiissel, 2007; Wilby and Dessai, 2010). The requirement is to balance the
short-term and the longer-term actions needed to resolve the underlying
causes of vulnerability and to understand the nature of changing climate
hazards (UNFCCC, 2008a; OECD, 2009). Achieving adaptation and
disaster risk management objectives while attaining human development
goals requires a number of cross-cutting, interlinked sectoral and
development processes, as well as effective strategies within sectors
and coordination between sectors (Few et al., 2006; Thomalla et al.,
2006; Biesbroek et al., 2010). Climate change is far too big a challenge
for any single ministry of a national government to undertake (CCCD,

"Sector-based organizations and departments play a central role in
national decisionmaking and are a logical focus for adaptation actions
(McGray et al., 2007; Biesbroek et al., 2010). The impacts of changing
climate risks in one sector, such as tourism, can affect other sectors and
scales significantly, especially since sectoral linkages operate both
vertically and horizontally. Sector plans, policies, and programs are
linked vertically from national to local levels within the same sector as
well as horizontally across different sectors at the same level (Urwin

While the case and need for integration within sectors and levels may
be clear, the issue of how to integrate or mainstream nationally across
multiple sectors and multiple levels still remains challenging, requiring
governance mechanisms and coordination that can cut across
governments and sectoral organizations (UNISDR, 2005; UNFCCC,

there are examples from developing countries where adaptation to
climate change and disaster risk management mainstreaming issues
have been priorities for many years and significant progress in
mainstreaming has been noted (e.g., the Caribbean Mainstreaming
Adaptation to Climate Change project, which was implemented from 2004
to 2007; Case Studies 9.2.9 and 9.2.12). In other cases, international
funding mechanisms such as the Least Developed Countries (LDC) Fund,
the Special Climate Change Fund, the Multi-donor Trust Fund on Climate
Change, and the Pilot Programme for Climate Resilience under the
Climate Investment Fund are making funding and resources available to
developing countries to pilot and mainstream changing climate risks

action and transformational change, although needs exceed availability
of funds (O’Brien et al., 2008; Krysanova et al., 2010; see Sections

"Table 6-1 (Section 6.3.1) outlines adaptation to climate change and
disaster risk management options for several selected sectors. As the
table indicates, adaptation and disaster risk management approaches
for many development sectors benefit jointly from ecosystem-based
adaptation and integrated land, water, and coastal zone management
actions. For example, conservation and sustainable management of
ecosystems, forests, land use, and biodiversity have the potential to create
win-win disaster risk protection services for agriculture, infrastructure,
cities, water resource management, and food security. They can also
create synergies between climate change adaptation and mitigation
measures (SCBD, 2009; CCCD, 2009), as well as produce many co-
benefits that address other development goals, including improvements
in livelihoods and human well being, particularly for the poor and
vulnerable, and biodiversity conservation, and are discussed further in

emergency response to a broader treatment of managing disaster risk;
(b) recognize that protecting people from disaster risk is at least partly
the responsibility of governments; and (c) promote the view that reducing

informal governance modes and institutions in all countries (Jaspars
and Maxwell, 2009), but a clear correlation between particular risk
governance models and specific political-administrative contexts is
difficult to identify (UNISDR, 2011a). The balance between formal or
informal, or technical and non-technical, risk governance strategies
depends on the economic, political, and environmental contexts of
individual countries or scales within countries, and the culture of
managing risks (Menkhaus, 2007; Kelman, 2008).

managing uncertainty and reducing disaster risk compared with disaster

legislation in some countries (such as the United Kingdom, the United
States, and Indonesia) has led to a focus on building institutional capacity
to help create resilience to disasters at different scales, but even in such
cases a strongly reactive culture is retained when observing the system
as a whole (O’Brien and Read, 2005, O’Brien, 2006, 2008; UNDP, 2009;
O'Brien and O'Keefe, 2010). This has been attributed to lack of political
will and insufficient financial and human resources for disaster risk
reduction (O'Brien 2006, 2008). Additionally, few studies have assessed

"Where risk management dimensions are a feature of national legislation,
positive changes are not always guaranteed (UNDP, 2004b). A lack of
financial, human, or technical resources and capacity constraints present
significant obstacles to full implementation, especially as experience
suggests that legislation should be implemented continuously from the
national to local level and is contingent on strong monitoring and
enforcement frameworks and adequate decentralization of responsibilities
and human and financial resources at every scale (UNDP, 2004b; Pelling
and Holloway, 2006). In some countries, building codes, for instance, are
often not implemented properly because of a lack of technical capacity
and political will of officials concerned (UNDP, 2004b). Where enforcement
is unfeasible, accountability for disaster risk management actions is
extremely challenging; this supports the need for an inclusive, consultative
process for discussing and drafting the legislation (UNDP, 2004b;
UNISDR, 2007b). Effective legislation includes benchmarks for action, a
procedure for evaluating actions, integrated planning to assist coordination
across geographical or sectoral areas of responsibility, and a feedback
system to monitor risk reduction activities and their outcomes (UNISDR,
2005; Pelling and Holloway, 2006).

"Disaster risk management legislation commonly establishes organizations
and their mandates, clarifies budgets, provides (dis)incentives, and
develops compliance and accountability mechanisms (UNDP, 2004b;
Llosa and Zodrow, 2011). Creating and improving legislation for disaster
risk reduction was included as a priority area in the HFA (UNISDR, 2005)
and the majority of countries — in excess of 80% — now have some form
of disaster risk management legislation (UNISDR, 2005; Bhavnani et al.,
2008). Legislation continues to be considered as an important component
of effective national disaster risk management systems (UNDP, 2004b;
UNISDR, 201 1a) as it creates the legal context of the enabling environment
in which others, working at different scales, can act, and it helps to
define people's rights to protection from disasters, assistance, and
compensation (Pelling and Holloway, 2006). Multi-stakeholder, cross-
sector bodies for coordinating disaster risk management actions and
implementing the HFA, known commonly as National Platforms, are
seen as key advocacy routes for achieving new and improved legislation
(UNISDR, 2005, 2007b). Where National Platforms are less prevalent or
less well organized, literature suggests that regional disaster management
bodies are viewed as responsible for advancing legislation (Pelling and
Holloway, 2006; UNISDR, 2007b). With new information on the impacts
of climate change, legislation on managing disaster risk may need to be
modified and strengthened to reflect changing rights and responsibilities
and to support the uptake of adaptation options (UNDP, 2009; Llosa and
Zodrow, 2011; see Case Study 9.2.12 on legislation).

‘National Platforms,’ defined as a “generic term for national mechanisms
for coordination and policy guidance on disaster risk reduction that are
multi-sectoral and inter-disciplinary in nature, with public, private and civil
society participation involving all concerned entities within a country”
(UNISDR, 2005). In some countries such coordinating mechanisms are
referred to by other names (Hay, 2009; Gero et al., 2011) but essentially
perform the same function. Guidelines on establishing National Platforms
suggest that they need to be built on existing relevant systems and
should include participation from different levels of government, key
line ministries, disaster management authorities, scientific and academic
institutions, civil society, the Red Cross/Red Crescent, the private sector,
opinion shapers, and other relevant sectors associated with disaster
risk management (UNISDR, 2007b). Evaluations and reflections on the
effectiveness of National Platforms for delivering results on the HFA and
on disaster risk management more broadly indicate widely varying

National Platforms struggling to obtain the legal mandate to secure full
participation of stakeholders, particularly NGOs, difficulty in obtaining
sustainable funding sources, and challenges associated with translating

"Governments in the past have ignored catastrophic risks in decisionmaking,
implicitly or explicitly exhibiting risk-neutrality (Mechler, 2004). This is
consistent with the Arrow Lind theorem (Arrow and Lind, 1970), according
to which a government may be well equipped to efficiently (i) pool risks
as it possesses a large number of independent assets and infrastructure
so that the aggregate risk converges to zero, and/or (ii) spread risk
across the taxpaying population base, so that per capita risk accruing to
risk-averse households converges to zero. In line with this theorem, due
to their ability to spread and diversify risks, governments are sometimes
termed ‘the most effective insurance instrument of society’ (Priest 1996).
Accordingly, it has been deduced that, although individuals are risk-
averse [to disasters risk], governments can take a risk-neutral approach.
However, the experiences of highly exposed countries suggest otherwise
and have led to a recent paradigm shift, with governments changing
from being ‘risk neutral’ to being risk averse and managing disaster risks.
Many highly exposed developing and developed countries (especially in
the wake of the recent financial crisis) have very limited economic
means, rely on small and exhausted tax bases, have high levels of
indebtedness, and are unable to raise sufficient and timely capital to
replace or repair damaged assets and restore livelihoods following
major disasters. This can lead to increased impacts of disaster shocks on
poverty and development (OAS, 1991; Linnerooth-Bayer et al., 2005;
Hochrainer, 2006; Mahul and Ghesquiere, 2007; Cummins and Mahul,
2009). Exposed countries thus have had to rely on donors to ‘bail’ them
out after events, although ex-post assistance usually only provides
partial relief and reconstruction funding, and such assistance is also often
associated with substantial time lags (Pollner, 2000; Mechler, 2004).

"Kenya's National Platform is situated under the Office of the President and has made significant achievements in coordinating multiple
stakeholders, but is constrained by limited resources and lack of budgets for disaster risk reduction in line ministries (National Platform
for Kenya, 2009). Some key constraints of the national system are recognized as being difficulties in integrating disaster risk reduction in
planning processes in urban and rural areas and lack of data on risks and vulnerabilities at different scales (Few et al., 2006). In this regard,
Nairobi has experienced periods of drought and heavy rains in the last decade, prompting action to reduce exposure and vulnerability to
what is perceived as changing hazard trends (ActionAid, 2006). Increasing exposure and vulnerability has resulted from a rapid expansion
of poor people living in informal settlements around Nairobi, leading to houses of weak building materials being constructed immediately
adjacent to rivers and blocking natural drainage areas. While data and coordination systems are still lacking, the Government of Kenya
has established the Nairobi Rivers Rehabilitation and Restoration Programme (African Development Bank Group, 2010), designed to
install riparian buffers, canals, and drainage channels, while also clearing existing channels. The Programme also targets the urban poor
with improved water and sanitation, paying attention to climate variability and change in the location and design of wastewater
infrastructure and environment monitoring for flood early warning (African Development Bank Group, 2010). This demonstrates the kind
of options for investments that can be achieved in the absence of a fully fledged nationally coordinated disaster management system
and in the absence of complete multi-hazard, exposure, and vulnerability data sets.

"While national level coordination is important and the majority of risks
associated with disasters and climate extremes are owned by national
governments and are managed centrally (see Section 6.2.1), sources
suggest that decentralization can be an effective risk management
strategy, especially in support of community-based disaster risk
management processes (Mitchell and Van Aalst, 2008; GNDR, 2009;
Scott and Tarazona, 2011). However, there are few studies that critically
examine the effectiveness of decentralization of disaster risk management
in detail (Twigg, 2004; Tompkins et al., 2008; Scott and Tarazona, 2011).
One such study of four countries — Colombia, Mozambique, Indonesia,
and South Africa — found that effective decentralization of disaster risk
reduction can be constrained by (a) low capacity at the local level;
(b) funds dedicated to disaster risk reduction often being channeled
elsewhere; (c) the fact that decentralization does not automatically lead
to more inclusive decisionmaking processes; (d) an appreciation that
decentralized systems face significant communications challenges; and
(e) knowledge that robust measures for ensuring accountability and
transparency are vital for effective disaster risk management but are
often missing (Scott and Tarazona, 2011). It appears that motivation for
management at a particular scale promises to influence how well the
impacts of disasters and climate change are managed, and therefore
affect disaster outcomes (Tsing et al., 1999). Decisions made at one scale
may have unintended consequences for another (Brooks and Adger,
2005), meaning that governance decisions will have ramifications across
scale and contexts. In all cases, the selection of a framework for
governance of disasters and climate change-related risks may be issue-
or context-specific (Sabatier, 1986).

"Budget and resource planning for extremes is not an easy proposition.
Governments commonly plan and budget for direct liabilities, that is,
liabilities that manifest themselves through certain and annually recurrent
events. Those liabilities are of explicit (as recognized by law or contract),
or implicit nature (moral obligations) (see Table 6-2). Yet, governments
are not good at planning for contingencies even for probable events, let
alone improbable events. Explicit, contingent liabilities deal with the
reconstruction of infrastructure destroyed by events, whereas implicit
obligations are associated with providing relief — commonly considered
as a moral liability for governments (Polackova Brixi and Mody, 2002).
In many countries, governments do not explicitly plan for contingent
liabilities, and rely on reallocating their resources following disasters
and raising capital from domestic and international donations to meet
infrastructure reconstruction needs and costs.

"Consequently, a risk-neutral stance in dealing with catastrophic risk
(implying that the consideration of risk broadly in terms of means — the

developing countries with limited diversification of their economies or
small tax bases. Accordingly, assessing and managing risks over the
whole spectrum of probabilities is gaining momentum (Cardenas et al.,

suggests: “Government decisions should be based on the opportunity
costs to society of the resources invested in the project and on the loss
of economic assets, functions and products. In view of the responsibility
vested in the public sector for the administration of scarce resources,
and considering issues such as fiscal debt, trade balances, income
distribution, and a wide range of other economic and social, and
political concerns, governments should not act risk-neutral” (OAS,

disaster risk and adapt to a changing climate, with the intention of
building a safe, secure society. This section discusses efforts made in
building a culture of safety (Section 6.5.1), which includes methods
associated with assessing and communicating risk; reducing climate-
related disaster risks (Section 6.5.2); transferring and sharing residual
risks (Section 6.5.3); and managing the impacts of disasters holistically
(Section 6.5.4), as disaster risks can never be reduced to zero.
Accordingly, it is important to recognize that the approaches, methods,
and tools discussed here are complementary, often overlapping, and
can be pursued simultaneously. Whereas the Summary for Policymakers
includes a visual representation of the range of such approaches (see
Figure SPM-2), Figure 6-3 on the previous page is tailored to incremental
action at the national level.

"Building a culture of safety involves several strategies and activities that
start with the assessment of risk factors and development of information
systems that provide relevant information for critical decisionmaking. It
also involves understanding the large variety of beliefs and core value
systems, which will help determine decisions made by different actors
and stakeholders. A key ingredient is appropriate public education and
awareness raising, and as such, early warning systems play an important
role in managing residual risk as they can provide timely warnings to
exposed communities and thus can promote action for a quick
response. Time series empirical data used to generate risk assessments,
including those contributing to early warnings, are also critical for long-
term planning because of their relevance in generating appropriate
information about adequate land use planning, for example, to reduce
climatic risks. As examples, in the same sense, analyzed information
about climate-adapted infrastructure, enhanced human development,
ecosystems protection, risks transfer, and sharing and managing the
impacts of climate-related disasters can play a fundamental role in
building a culture and practice of human safety.

"After the initial phase that was characterized by spending in line with requirements caused by disaster events, one concern for the
disaster management authorities became the regular demands on the funds in non-disaster years. As a consequence, budgeted FONDEN
resources were declining while demands on FONDEN’s resources were becoming more volatile, and outlays often exceeded budgeted
funds causing the reserve fund to decline. In 2005, after the severe hurricane season affecting large parts of coastal Mexico, the fund
was finally exhausted. This forced the Mexican Government to look at alternative risk financing strategies, which included hedging
against disaster shocks, government agencies at all levels providing their insurance protection independent of FONDEN, and that
FONDEN itself should only indemnify losses that exceed the financial capacity of the federal, local, or municipal government agencies. In
2006, Mexico became the first transition country to transfer part of its public sector catastrophe risk to the international reinsurance and
capital markets, and, in 2009, the transaction was renewed for another three years, covering both hurricane and earthquake risk
(Cardenas et al., 2007).

"Mexico is exposed to natural hazards due to its location within one of the world’s most active seismic regions and in the path of
hurricanes and tropical storms originating in the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. There have been many disaster events
and in the past severe hurricane disasters (in addition to earthquakes) have created large fiscal liabilities and imbalances (Cardenas et
al., 2007). Given high perceived financial vulnerability to disasters, in 1994, the Mexican Government passed a law that required federal,
state, and municipal public assets to be insured. This was intended to relieve the central government of the obligation of having to pay
for the reconstruction of public infrastructure, although the adequate level of insurance, particularly for very large events remained a
concern. As a next step, in 1996, the national government established a system of allocating resources for disaster spending (FONDEN)
in order to enhance the country’s financial preparedness for disaster losses and prevent imbalances in the federal government finances
derived from outlays caused by catastrophes. FONDEN serves as last-resort funding for uninsurable losses, such as emergency response
and disaster relief expenditures. In addition to this budgetary program, in 1999, a reserve fund was created that accumulates the surplus
of the previous year's FONDEN budget item (Cardenas et al., 2007).

"As discussed widely in Chapter 1, the first key step in managing risk is
to assess and characterize it. In terms of risk factors, disaster risk is
commonly defined by three elements: the hazard, exposure of elements,
and vulnerability (Swiss Re, 2000; Kuzak, 2004; Grossi and Kunreuther,
2005; CACCA, 2010). Thus, understanding risk involves observing and
recording hazards and hazard analysis, studying exposure and drivers of
vulnerability, and vulnerability assessment. Responding to risks is
dependent on the way risk-based information is framed in the context
of public perception and risk management needs.

"Given the ‘public good’ nature of much of disaster-related information
(Benson and Clay, 2004), governments have a fundamental role in
providing good-quality and context-specific risk information about, for
example, the geographical distribution of people, assets, hazards, risks, and
disaster impacts and vulnerability to support disaster risk management
(McBean, 2008). Good baseline information and robust time series
information are key for long-term risk monitoring and assessments, not
only for hazards, but also for evaluating the evolution of vulnerability and
exposure (McEntire and Myers, 2004; Aldunce and Leon, 2007). Regular
updating of information about hazards, exposure, and vulnerability are
also necessary because of the dynamic nature of disaster risk, especially

"A key component in the risk assessment process is to determine exposed
elements at risk. This may relate to persons, buildings, infrastructure
(e.g., water and sewer facilities, roads, and bridges), agricultural assets,
livelihoods, ecosystems, natural infrastructure, and ecosystem services
in harm’s way that can be impacted in case of a disaster event. For
national level assessments, their aggregate values are of interest.
Ideally, this would be based on national asset inventories, national
population census, and other national information. In practice, collecting
an inventory on assets and their values often proves very difficult and
expensive due to the heterogeneity and sheer number of the examined
elements (see Cummins and Mahul, 2009). In addition, risk management
processes require identifying those elements of the social process that
also contribute to vulnerability — such as organizational and economic
capacities, human development status of communities at risk, and
capacity to respond to disasters (Lavell, 1996; Cardona et al., 2010) — as
well as assessing the impacts following disaster events (ECLAC, 2003;
Benson and Clay, 2004). Considerable progress has been made in the
generation and use of such information including in some developing

"Traditionally, early warning systems have been interpreted narrowly as
technological instruments for detecting and forecasting impending hazard
events and for issuing alerts (Rogers and Tsirkunov, 2010). However, this
interpretation does not clarify whether warning information is received

risks (Basher, 2006; Rogers and Tsirkunov, 2010). As noted in Case Study

(UNISDR, 2005).

"Country- and context-specific information on disaster impacts and losses,
including baseline data about observations (different types of losses,
weather data) from past events, is often very limited and of mixed
quality (see Embrechts et al., 1997; Carter et al., 2007). Data records at
best may date back several decades, and thus often would provide
only one reference data point for extreme events, such as a 100-
year event (see Section 3.2.1). Data on losses from extremes can also be
systematically biased due to high media attention (Guha-Sapir and
Below, 2002). At times the data on losses are incomplete, as in the
Pacific small island developing states, because of limited capacity to
systematically collect information at the time of disaster, or because of
inconsistent methodologies and the costs of measures used (Chung,
2009; Lal, 2010).

"An effective early warning system delivers accurate, timely, and meaningful

trigger effective responses (UNISDR, 2005; Basher, 2006; Gwimbi,

Warnings fail in both developing and developed countries for a number
of reasons, including inaccurate weather and climate forecasting,
public ignorance of prevailing conditions of vulnerability, failure to
communicate the threat clearly or in time, lack of local organization,
and failure of the recipients to understand or believe in the warning or
to take suitable action (UNISDR, 2006; Auld, 2008a; Rogers and
Tsirkunov, 2010). To be effective and complete, an early warning system
typically is composed of four interacting elements (Basher, 2006;
UNISDR, 2006): (1) generation of risk knowledge including monitoring
and forecasting; (2) surveillance and warning services; (3) dissemination
and communication; and (4) response capability. Warnings are received

"Governments also maintain early warning systems to warn their citizens
and themselves about impending creeping climate- and weather-related
hazards. For example, ‘early warnings’ of potentially poor seasons have
been successful at informing key actions for agricultural planning on
longer time scales and for producing proactive responses (Meinke et al.,
2006; Vogel and O'Brien, 2006). Case Study 9.2.11 provides examples of
early warning systems for short-response hazards as well as for creeping
hazards operating on time scales from weeks to seasonal. This case study
also highlights the possibility of using weather and climate predictions
for timeframes longer than a few days to provide advanced warning of
extreme conditions, which has been only a very recent development.
Studies indicate that successful early warning systems are reliant on
close inter-institutional collaboration between national meteorological
and hydrological services and the agencies that directly intervene in
rural areas, such as extension services, development projects, and civil
society organizations (Meinke et al., 2006; Vogel and O'Brien, 2006;

databases of reinsurers such as Munich Re. Comparisons of international
and national disaster loss databases have shown significant variations
in documented losses due to inconsistencies in the definition of key
parameters and estimation methods used. This emphasizes the need to
standardize parameter definitions and estimation methods (Guha-Sapir
and Below, 2002; ECLAC, 2003; Tschoeg| et al., 2006). For some countries,
a reasonable quality and quantity of information may exist on the direct
impacts, particularly where the reinsurance industry, consulting firms,
and multi-lateral financial institutions have worked together with the
research communities. Limited information is generally available on
socially relevant effects of disasters, such as the incidence of health
effects after a disaster as well as the impacts on ecosystems, which
have not been well studied (Benson and Twigg 2004). Furthermore, the
assessment of indirect disaster impacts on social or economic systems,
such as on income-generating sectors and national savings, needs greater
attention (ECLAC, 2003; Benson and Clay, 2004). Such information can

Because emergency responders, the media, and the public often are
unable to translate the scientific information on forecast hazards in
warnings into risk levels and responses, early warning systems are most
effective when their users can identify and interpret the general warning
messages into simple and relevant local impacts and actions (e.g., flash
flood warning and the need to evacuate areas at risk), prioritize the most
dangerous hazards, assess potential contributions from cumulative and
sequential events to risks, and identify thresholds linked to escalating
risks for infrastructure, communities, and disaster response (UNISDR,

integration between early warning systems and contingency planning

"Different hazards and different sectors often require unique preparedness,
warnings, and response strategies (Basher, 2006; UNISDR, 2006). For
example, the needs and responses behind a warning of a drought, a
tornado, a cyclone, or a fire are very different. Some hazards may
represent singular extreme events, sequences, or compound combinations
of hazards while other hazards can be described as ‘creeping’ or
accumulations of events (or non-events). For example, the World
Meteorological Organization (WMO), national meteorological and
hydrological services, the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO), and others recognize that combinations
of weather and climate hazards can result in complex emergency
response situations and are working to establish multi-hazard early
warning systems for complex risks such as heat waves and vector-borne
diseases (UNISDR, 2006; WMO, 2007) and early warnings of pests and
food safety threats and disease outbreaks (e.g., prediction of a potential
desert locust crisis) (WMO, 2004, 2007; FAO, 2010). Other ‘creeping’
hazards can evolve over a period of days to months; floods and
droughts, for example, can result from cumulative or sequential multi-
hazard events, especially when accompanied by an already existing
vulnerability, while other hazards such as accumulated precipitation can
lead to critical infrastructure failure (Basher, 2006; Auld, 2008a; Rogers

"The timing and form of climatic information (including forecasts and
projections), and access to trusted guidance to help interpret and
implement the information and projections in decisionmaking processes,
may be more important to individual users than improved reliability and
forecast skill (Pulwarty and Redmond, 1997; Rayner et al. 2005;
Gwimbi, 2007; Rogers and Tsirkunov, 2010). Decisionmakers typically
manage risks holistically, while scientific information is generally
derived using reductionist approaches (Meinke et al., 2006). The net
outcome can be a ‘disconnect’ between scientists and decisionmakers
with the result that climate and hydro-meteorological information can
be developed that, although scientifically sound, may lack relevance to
the decisionmaker (Cash and Buizer, 2005; Meinke et al., 2006; Vogel and
O'Brien, 2006; Averyt, 2010). Perceptions of irrelevance, inconsistency,
confusion, or doubt can delay action (NRC, 2009). Some studies (Lowe,
2003; Glantz, 2005; Meinke et al., 2006; Feldman and Ingram, 2009)
advise scientists and practitioners to work together to produce trustworthy
knowledge that combines scientific excellence with social relevance, a
point also emphasized in Case Study 9.2.2 on fire. These studies suggest
that decision support activities should be driven by users’ needs, not by
scientific research priorities, and that these user needs are not always
known in advance, but should be identified collaboratively and iteratively
in ongoing two-way communication between knowledge producers and
decisionmakers (Cash and Buizer, 2005; NRC, 2009). It has been
suggested that this ongoing interaction, two-way communication, and
collaboration allows scientists and decisionmakers to get to know each
other, to develop an understanding of what decisionmakers need to
know and what science can provide, to build trust, and, over time,
develop highly productive relationships as the basis for effective
decision support (Feldman and Ingram, 2009; NRC, 2009; Averyt, 2010).

toward the most vulnerable populations (Basher, 2006; UNISDR, 2010).
At the same time, national governments can also play an important role

built environment and urban areas, particularly for low- and middle-
income countries, is one that is not always fully appreciated by many
national governments and development and disaster specialists
(Rossetto, 2007; Moser and Satterthwaite, 2008). Low- and middle-
income countries, which account for close to three-quarters of the
world’s urban populations, are at greatest risk from extreme events and
also have far less capacity than do high-income countries, largely due to
backlogs in protective infrastructure and services and limitations in urban
government (Satterthwaite et al., 2007; Moser and Satterthwaite, 2008).
Rapid growth and expansion in urban areas, particularly in developing
countries, can outpace infrastructure development and lead to a lack of
infrastructure services for housing, sewer systems, effective transportation,
and emergency response and increased vulnerability to weather and
climate extremes (Satterthwaite et al., 2007; Birkmann et al., 2011).
These impacts from the changing climate will be particularly severe for
populations living in poor-quality housing on illegally occupied land,
where there is little incentive for investments in more resilient buildings
or infrastructure and service provision (Freeman and Warner, 2001;

infrastructure or networks, studies recommend consideration of likely
climate change impacts that will potentially affect the planned useful

extrapolated to represent the future. For example, water-related

"Studies indicate that the greatest losses in suitable agricultural cropland
due to climate change are likely to be in Africa, particularly sub-Saharan
Africa (Ikeme, 2003; FAO, 2010). Assessing food security issues in this
vulnerable area requires consideration of multiple socioeconomic and
environmental variables, including climate (Verdin et al., 2005; Virtanin
et al, 2011). In sub-Saharan Africa, where large and widely dispersed
populations depend on rain-fed agriculture and pastoralism, climate
monitoring and forecasting are important inputs to food security analysis
and assessments. Since conventional climate and hydro-meteorological
networks in these areas are sparse and often report with significant delays,
there is a growing need for increased capacity in rainfall observations,
forecasting, data management, and modeling applications (Verdin et
al., 2005; Heltberg et al., 2009; FAO, 2010). Studies indicate a need for
rainfall observation networks to be expanded and to incorporate satellite
information; for data management systems to be improved; for tailored
forecast information to be disseminated and used by decisionmakers;
and for more effective early warning systems that can integrate seasonal
forecasts with drought projections as inputs for hazards, food security,
and vulnerability analysis (Verdin et al., 2005; Heltberg et al., 2009; FAO,
2010). Other short-term but limited strategies to minimize food security
risks include diversifying livelihoods to spread risk, farming in different
ecological niches, building social networks, productive safety net and
social protection schemes, and risk pooling at the regional or national
level to reduce financial exposure (Brooks et al., 2009; Halsnaes and
Traerup, 2009; Heltberg et al., 2009; FAO, 2010). Specific longer-term
strategies to address the increasing risks, particularly given uncertainties,
include land rehabilitation, terracing and reforestation, measures to
enhance water catchment and irrigation techniques, improvements to

sensitive to changes in climate extremes (Agrawala and van Aalst,

limited by a lack of understanding and interpretation of how these

successful policies and plans. Nationally, good progress is being made
in strengthening some disaster reduction capacities for disaster
preparedness and early warning and response systems and in addressing
some of the underlying risk drivers in many developing country regions
and sectors (Manuel-Navarrete et al., 2007; UNISDR, 2009c). For example,
social safety nets and other similar national-level programs, particularly
for poverty reduction and attainment of the Millennium Development

future climate hazards (Yamin et al., 2005; Tanner and Mitchell 2008;

transfers to the most vulnerable, versions of weather-indexed crop

Tanner and Mitchell, 2008; Heltberg et al., 2009). Other measures, such
as social pensions that transfer cash from the national level to vulnerable
people, provide some buffers against climate hazards (Davies et al., 2008;
Heltberg et al., 2009). However, lack of capacity and good governance

with a fire policy or covered under an ‘all hazards’ policy. The contracts
differ in the extent of cover offered, as well as indemnity limits, and
whether the policies are compulsory, bundled, or voluntary. Importantly,
they differ institutionally with regard to the involvement of the public
authorities and private insurers and how they allocate liability and
responsibility for disaster losses across individual households, businesses,
and taxpayers (Schwarze and Wagner, 2004; Aakre et al., 2010).

"Private insurers are often not willing to fully underwrite the risks and
many countries, including Japan, France, the United States, Norway, and
New Zealand, have therefore instituted public-private national insurance
systems, where participation of the insured is mandatory or voluntary
and single hazards may be insured or comprehensive insurance offered
(Linnerooth-Bayer and Mechler, 2007). Further, specific strategies may
be employed to increase market penetration of risks that are not
easily covered by regular avenues. As one example, in India, pro-poor
regulation stipulates that insurers within their regular business segment
reserve a certain quota of insurance policies for the poor and thus cross-
subsidize fledgling low-income micro-insurance policies (Mechler et al.,
2006a).
"	Text
"Yet, realizing the shortcomings of after-the-event approaches for coping
with disaster losses for small, low-income or highly exposed countries
with over-stretched tax bases and highly correlated infrastructure risks
(OAS, 1991; Pollner, 2000; Mechler, 2004; Cardona, 2006; Linnerooth-
Bayer and Mechler, 2007; Mahul and Ghesquiere, 2007), sovereign
insurance for public sector assets and relief expenditure has become a
recent cornerstone for tackling the substantial and increasing effects of
disasters (Mahul and Ghesquiere, 2007). As a general statement, the
strategy involves transferring a layer of risks ranging from infrequent
risk (such as events with a return period of more than 10 years) up to risks
associated with 150-year return periods, beyond which it will become
very costly to insure (Cummins and Mahul, 2009). One key element is to
define the financial vulnerability indicating the inability to bear losses
with a certain return period (Mechler et al., 2010).
"	Text
"As well, governments may insure their liabilities through sovereign
insurance. Liabilities arise as governments own a large portfolio of
public infrastructure and other assets that are exposed to disaster risks.
Moreover, most governments accept their role as provider of post-
disaster emergency relief and assistance to vulnerable and affected
households and businesses. In wealthy countries, government (sovereign)
insurance hardly exists at the national level and, in Sweden, insurance
for public assets is illegal (Linnerooth-Bayer and Amendola, 2000). On
the other hand, states in the United States, Canada, and Australia,
although regulated not to incur budget deficits, often carry cover for
their public assets (Burby, 1991). As discussed earlier (see Section 6.4.3),
this is consistent with the Arrow and Lind Theorem, which suggests that
governments can efficiently spread and share risk over their citizens
without buying sovereign insurance policies.
"	Text
"Employing insurance and other risk-financing instruments for helping to
manage the vagaries of nature may often involve the building of PPPs
in developing and in developed countries in order to tackle market
failure, adverse selection, and the sheer non-availability of such
instruments (see Aakre et al., 2010). Because of such reasons, there is a
role for governments to not only create an enabling environment for
private sector engagement, but also to regulate its activities. In the
development context, Hazell and Hess (2010) distinguish between
protection and promotion models, while acknowledging that in many
instances hybrid combinations may contain elements of both.
Protection relates to governments helping to protect themselves,
individuals, and businesses from destitution and poverty by providing
ex-post financial assistance, which, however, is taken out as an ex-ante
instrument as insurance before disasters. The promotion model relates
to the public sector promoting more stable livelihoods and higher
income opportunities by better helping businesses and households
access risk financing, including micro-financing.
"	Text
"Yet, insurance coverage is limited and globally only about 20% of the
losses from weather-related events have been insured over the period
1980 to 2003 (also see Section 6.2.2). In many instances, insurance
providers even in industrialized countries have been reluctant to offer
region- or nationwide policies covering flood and other hazards
because of the systemic nature of these risks, as well as problems of
moral hazard and adverse selection (Froot, 2001; Aakre et al., 2010). In
some highly exposed countries, such as The Netherlands for flood risk,
insurance is even non-existent and government relief is dispensed in
lieu (Botzen et al., 2009). In many developing countries, there is little in
terms of insurance for disaster risks, yet novel index-based micro-
insurance solutions have been developed and are starting to show
results (Hazell and Hess, 2010; see also Sections 5.6.3 and Case Study
9.2.13 on risk financing). Market mechanisms may work less well in
developing countries, particularly because there is often limited risk
assessment information, limited scope for risk pooling, and little or no
supply of insurance instruments. In such circumstances, governments
may need to create enabling environments by helping to estimate risk,
helping to develop training programs for insurer's staff, and generally
promoting awareness among the population at risk (Linnerooth-Bayer
et al., 2005; Hoeppe and Gurenko, 2006; Cummins and Mahul, 2009;
Hazell and Hess, 2010).

international community is engaged in major emergencies is shaped by
existing national capabilities and social contracts, with four possible
response approaches (Chandran and Jones 2008; ALNAP, 2010b; see

"In terms of how responses are managed nationally, there are different
models to consider (ALNAP, 2010b). Many countries now have some
standing capacity to manage disaster events (Interworks, 1998) and this
should be considered distinct from national systems for managing
disaster risk, commonly associated with ‘national platforms’ detailed in
Section 6.4.2. Examples of standing disaster management capacity
include the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the United
States, Public Safety in Canada, the National Commission for Disaster
Reduction in China, the National Disaster Management Authorities in
India and Indonesia, National Disaster Management Offices (NDMO) in
many Pacific island countries, and the Civil Contingencies Secretariat in
the United Kingdom. Comparative analysis of these structures shows
that there are a number of common elements (Interworks, 1998;
Coppola, 2007). Countries with formal disaster management structures
typically operate a system comprised of a National Disaster Committee,
which works to provide high-level authority and ministerial coordination,
alongside an NDMO to lead the practical implementation of disaster
preparedness and response (Interworks, 1998). National Committees
are typically composed of representatives from different ministries and
departments as well as the Red Cross/Red Crescent. They might also
include donor agencies, NGOs, and the private sector. The committee

"Even in the rare circumstances where efforts outlined previously are all
in place, there still needs to be investment in capacities to manage
potential disaster impacts as risk cannot be reduced to zero (Pelling,
2003; Wisner et al., 2004; Coppola, 2007). The scale of the disaster
impact should ideally dictate the level and extent of response. Individual
household capacities to respond to disasters may be quickly overwhelmed,
requiring local resources to be mobilized (del Ninno, 2001). When
community-level responses are overwhelmed, regional or central
governments are called upon (Coppola, 2007). Some events may
overwhelm national government capacities too, and may require
mobilization of the international community of humanitarian responders
(Fagen, 2008; Harvey, 2009). International responses pose the most
complex management challenges for national governments, because of
the diversity of actors that are involved and the multiple resources flows
that are established (Borton, 1993; Bennett et al., 2006; Ramalingam et
al., 2008; ALNAP, 2010a). However, although humanitarian principles
call for a proportionate and equitable response, in practice there are a few
high-profile disasters that are over-resourced, with many more that are
‘forgotten or neglected emergencies’ (Slim, 2006). Despite the definition of
international or national disasters as those where immediate capacities
are overwhelmed, evaluations routinely find that most of the vital life-
saving activities happen at the local level, led by households, communities,
and civil society (see Sections 5.1 and 5.2; Smillie, 2001; Hilhorst, 2003;
ALNAP, 2005; Telford and Cosgrave, 2006).

for the vast majority of the increasing trend in disaster losses (see SPM
and Section 4.5.3.3), climate change-related disasters are still widely, if
incorrectly, seen by particularly the humanitarian community as playing
a major role in increasing the overall human impact of disasters.
Numerous trends in disaster events are commonly attributed to climate
change (IASC, 2009a; IFRC, 2009), and, as such, climate change is often
cited as a reason for enhancing both national and international disaster
management capacities (HFP, 2007; Oxfam, 2007; IASC, 2009a,b).

"The challenges of climate change call for institutional changes in
approaches to managing disasters that are far from trivial (Salter 1998),
with such challenges including more appropriate policies and legislation;
decentralization of capacities and resources; greater budgetary allocation;
improved capacity building at the local level; and the political will to
bridge the divide between disaster risk reduction activities and the
humanitarian action associated with managing disasters (Sanderson,
2000; UNISDR, 2005). Recent analyses of the need for greater innovation
in international humanitarian responses (Ramalingam et al., 2009)
present these shifts as among the most significant and important
reforms the international system must undergo.

"Other approaches include assessments of disaster risk management
with risk assessment at the core, and focusing on economic efficiency of
management responses (see World Bank, 1996; Benson and Twigg, 2004;
Mechler, 2004). Using such a rationale, the World Bank, for example,
goes as far as suggesting that governments should in many instances
prioritize allocating their resources on early warning (such as for
floods), critical infrastructure, such as water and electricity lifelines, and
supporting environmental buffers such as mangroves, forests, and
wetlands, of which the latter should be treated with caution (World
Bank and UN, 2010). Another report suggests taking an adaptation cost
curve approach to selecting adaptation options (ECA, 2009); this
approach organizes adaptation options around their cost-benefit ratios,
similar to mitigation cost curves. Interestingly, many of the options
considered efficient in this analysis are ‘soft’ options, such as reviving
reefs, using mangroves as barriers, and nourishing beaches.

"In order to align disaster risk management with the challenges presented
by climate change, it is necessary to assess the effectiveness and
efficiency of management options in a changing climate based on the
best available information, recognizing that that information remains
patchy at best. Adopting an economic assessment framework, different
approaches have been used to comment on the effectiveness or efficiency
of adaptation options. Many climate adaptation studies have focused on
the national-level costs of adaptation rather than comparing costs and
benefits (i.e., examining the benefits of adaptation or reduced disaster
impacts and damage costs) (see Nordhaus, 2006; EEA, 2007; UNFCCC,
2007a; Agrawala and Fankhauser, 2008; World Bank, 2008; ECA, 2009;
Parry et al., 2009). National-level adaptation assessments have been
conducted, among others, in the European Union, the United Kingdom,
Finland, The Netherlands, and Canada, as well as in a number of
developing countries using the NAPA approach (UNDP, 2004c; MMM, 2005;
DEFRA, 2006; UNFCCC, 2007b; Lemmen et al., 2008; De Bruinet al., 2009a).

"It is, however, difficult to make conclusive assessments about the
effectiveness of disaster risk management in a changing climate, as
overall the evidence base used to determine economic efficiency — that
is, benefits net of costs of adaptation — remains limited and fragmented

In addition to the rather small number of studies available, there are
important limitations of these assessments as well. These relate to the
types of hazards examined as well as treatment of extreme events and
risk, affecting the robustness of the results. Another key limitation, relevant
for this report, is that only very few national level studies assessing
economic efficiency of options have focused explicitly on disaster risk,
and in most instances the hazards examined have been gradual, such as
sea level rise and slower onset impacts, such as drought, on agriculture
(see UNFCCC, 2007a; Agrawala and Fankhauser, 2008). Where extreme

"As mentioned, climate change presents multidimensional challenges for
national systems for managing the risks of climate extremes and disaster
risks, including potential changes in the way society views, treats, and
responds to risks and projected impacts on hazards, exposure, and
vulnerability. As climate change is altering the frequency and magnitude
of some extreme events (see Chapter 3) and contributing to trends in
exposure and vulnerability (see Chapter 4), the efficacy of national systems
of disaster risk management requires review and realignment with the
new challenges (UNISDR, 2009c; Mitchell et al., 2010a; Polack, 2010; see
FAQ 6.1). Literature suggests that the effectiveness of national systems
for managing disaster risk in a changing climate will be improved if they
integrate assessments of changing climate extremes and disasters into
current investments, strategies, and activities; seek to strengthen the
adaptive capacity of all actors; and address the causes of vulnerability
and poverty recognizing climate change as one such cause (Schipper,
2009; UNISDR 2009c; Mitchell et al., 2010a). In practice, this might
require: (i) new alliances and hybrid organizations across government
and potentially across countries; (ii) different actors to join the national
system; (iii) new cross-sector relationships; (iv) reallocation of functions,
responsibilities, and resources across scales; and (v) new practices (Hedger
et al., 2010; Mitchell et al, 2010a; Polack, 2010). As a complement to the
available data, information, and knowledge about the impact of climate
change and disaster risk presented in Chapters 2, 3, and 4, this section
seeks to elaborate the key areas where realignment of national systems
could occur — in assessing the effectiveness of disaster risk management
in a changing climate (Section 6.6.1), managing uncertainty and adaptive
management (Section 6.6.2), in tackling poverty, vulnerability, and their
structural causes (Section 6.6.3); and commenting on the practicalities of

¢ Use risk-sharing and transfer mechanisms to protect financial security: To effectively support communities and protect the
financial security of the country, governments are increasingly using a range of financial instruments for transferring costs of disaster
losses through risk-sharing mechanisms. Key risk transfer instruments include financial insurance, micro-insurance, and micro-
financing, investment in social capital, government disaster reserve funds, and intergovernmental risk sharing. The latter two help
to provide much needed relief and immediate liquidity after a disaster in regions where individual countries, because of their size
and lack of diversity, cannot have viable risk insurance schemes. Such mechanisms can allow for more effective government
response, provide some relief of the fiscal burden placed on governments due to disaster impacts, and constitute critical steps in
promoting more proactive risk management strategies and responses (see Section 6.5.3).

¢ Not all disaster risk can be eliminated, so act to manage residual risk too: Even with effective disaster risk reduction policies
and practices in place, it is impossible to reduce all disaster risks to zero and some residual risks will remain. With disaster risks
increasing in many countries, steps could be taken to strengthen governments’ ability to effectively manage residual risks effectively,
and in doing so will need to strengthen partnerships with other actors and stakeholders to enable quick and effective humanitarian
response that includes measures to ‘build back better’ and build resilience over time (for example, using rapid climate risk assessments
to position critical infrastructure or relief camps in safer locations during relief and reconstruction phases). Many governments are
also already working to enhance their disaster preparedness and early warning systems, focusing on the accuracy and timeliness of
warnings, increasing public awareness, working with communities to ensure messages are communicated and transmitted effectively,
and enhancing preparedness measures, such as first aid training, providing swimming lessons, encouraging households to have a
disaster plan and an emergency kit, securing and indicating evacuation routes and shelters, and enhancing the skills of relief workers
in child protection, for example (see Section 6.5.4).

¢ Review resilience-building efforts: Given competing priorities and development goals, governments are forced to balance
resource allocation across development goals. The decision to bear residual losses is always a risk management option due to
financial and other constraints. Many governments decide to accept the full risk of very low probability and surprise events, but
new information on the impacts of climate change on such events may lead to such decisions being reviewed. Even in such cases
where risk reduction and risk transfer is not a viable management option, investments in reducing vulnerability and enhancing early
warning, preparedness, and standing capacity for emergency response can lead to positive returns. Furthermore, given uncertainties
associated with disasters, efforts to promote flexible institutions, cross-scale learning, improved knowledge and awareness, and
redundancies in response systems (in case one part of the system is badly impacted) can all help to promote resilience to very low
probability and surprise events. Many governments are also encouraging maintenance and strengthening of social cohesiveness
and social networks as a form of insurance enabling families and friends to support each other in times of disasters (see Sections
6.6.2 and 6.6.3).

of aspects of resilience policy (notably adaptive management) on forests,
coral reefs, disasters, and adaptation to climate change; however, most

"Spare capacity within institutions has been argued to increase the ability
of socio-ecological systems to address surprises or external shocks (Folke
et al., 2005). McDaniels et al. (2008), in their analysis of hospital resilience
to earthquake impacts, agreed with this finding, concluding that key
features of resilience include the ability to learn from previous experience,
careful management of staff during hazard, daily communication, and
willingness of staff to address specific system failures. The latter can be
achieved through creating overlapping institutions with shared delivery
of services/functions, and providing redundant capacity within these
institutions thereby allowing a sharing of the risks (Low et al., 2003).
Such redundancy increases the chances of social memory being retained
within the institution (Ostrom, 2005). However, if not carefully managed,
costs of this approach can include fragmented policy, high transactions
costs, duplication, inconsistencies, and inefficiencies (Imperial, 1999).

"Adaptive management, as defined in Chapter 8 (Section 8.6.3.1), is “a
structured process for improving management policies and practices by
systemic learning from the outcomes of implemented strategies, and by
taking into account changes in external factors in a proactive manner”
(Pahl-Wostl et al., 2009; Pahl-Wostl, 2009). It has come to also mean
bringing together interdisciplinary science, experience, and traditional
knowledge into decisionmaking through ‘learning by doing’ by individuals
and organizations (Walters, 1997). Decisionmakers, under adaptive
management, are expected to be flexible in their approach, and accept
new information as it become available, or when new challenges emerge,
and not be rigid in their responses. Proponents argue that effective
adaptive management contributes to more rapid knowledge acquisition
and better information flows between policymakers, and ensures that
there is shared understanding of complex problems (Lee, 1993).
"	Text
"One of the main unresolved issues in adaptive management is how to
ensure that scientists and engineers tasked with investigating adaptation
and disaster risk management processes are able to learn from each
other and from practitioners and how this learning can be integrated to
inform policy and management practices. In the case of the restoration
of the Florida Everglades, a limiting factor to effective management
observed was the unwillingness of some parts of society to accept short-
term losses for longer-term sustainability of ecosystem services (Kiker et
al., 2001). Investment in hurricane preparedness in New Orleans prior to
Hurricane Katrina provides a contemporary example of science not being
included in disaster risk decisionmaking and planning (Laska, 2004;
Congleton, 2006). The Cayman Islands hurricane management, on the
other hand, demonstrates a success story in a flexible disaster management
committee being prepared to change its strategies and measures from
experience, and essentially learning by doing (Box 6-7).

"predictive models and early warning systems (see Section 3.2.3 and
Box 3-2; Section 9.2.11). Early warning systems are also based on
models and consequently there is always a probability of their success (or
failure) in predicting events accurately, although the failure to heed early
warning systems is also a function of social factors, such as perception
of risk, trust in the information-providing institution, previous experience
of the hazard, degree of social exclusion, and gender (see, e.g., Drabek,
1986, 1999). Enhanced scientific modeling and interdisciplinary
approaches to early warning systems can address some of these
uncertainties provided good baseline and time series information are
available (see Section 3.2.3 and Box 3-2). Even where such information
is available, there remain other unresolved questions that influence the
outcome of hazards. These relate to the capacity of ecosystems to provide
buffering services, and the ability of systems to recover. Management
approaches that take these issues into account include adaptive
management and resilience, yet these approaches are not without their
challenges (also see Section 8.6.3.1).

"Key aspects that are relevant to building disaster resilience are flexibility, learning, and adaptive governance (Adger et al., 2005; Berkes,
2007), and the Cayman Islands (Tompkins et al., 2008) illustrate how such factors help to successfully manage their disaster risks. For
example, in 2004, Hurricane Ivan (which was similar in magnitude to Hurricane Katrina that hit New Orleans in 2005) only caused two
fatalities in the island, largely due to the activities of the National Hurricane Committee (NHC), which manages hurricane disaster risk
reduction in the Cayman Islands and is responsible for preparedness, response, and recovery. The NHC is a learning-based organization.
It learns from its successes, but more importantly from mistakes made. Each year the disaster managers actively assess the previous
year's risk management successes and failures. Every year the National Hurricane Plan is revised to incorporate this learning and to
ensure that good practices are institutionalized. Evidence of adaptive governance can be observed, for example, in the changing
composition of the NHC, its structure, network arrangements, funding allocation, and responsibilities. Policymakers are encouraged to
design and to implement new initiatives, to make adjustments, and take motivated actions. Creating such space for experimentation,
innovation, learning, and institutional adjustment is crucial for disaster resilience.

climate change to alter value systems and people's perceptions. As Table

"‘Learning by doing’ in disaster risk management can only be undertaken
effectively if the management institutions are scaled appropriately,
where necessary at the local level, or at multiple scales with effective
interaction (Gunderson and Holling, 2002; Eriksen et al., 2011). For the
management of climate extremes, the appropriate scale is influenced by
the magnitude of the hazard and the affected area, including biological
diversity. Research suggests that increasing biological diversity of
ecosystems allows a greater range of ecosystem responses to hazards,
and this increases the resilience of the entire system (Elmqvist et al.,
2003). Other research has shown that reducing non-climate stresses on
ecosystems can enhance their resilience to climate change. This is the
case for coral reefs (Hughes et al., 2003; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2008)
and rainforests (Malhi et al., 2008). Managing the resources at the
appropriate scale, for example, water catchment or coastal zone instead
of managing smaller individual tributaries or coastal sub-systems (such
as mangroves), is becoming more urgent (Sorensen, 1997; Parkes and
Horwitz, 2009).

"This assessment has found that future trends in exposure, vulnerability,
and climate extremes may further alter disaster risk and associated impacts.
Future trends in climate extremes will be affected by anthropogenic
climate change in addition to natural climate variability, and exposure and
vulnerability will be influenced by both climatic and non-climatic factors
(SPM; Sections 2.2, 2.3, and 2.5). Accordingly, reducing vulnerability and
its underlying drivers is a considered a critical aspect of addressing both
observed and projected changes in disaster risk (UNISDR 2009c, 201 1b;
Figure 6-3). Section 6.5.2.2 discussed the centrality of human development
and vulnerability reduction to the goal of disaster risk reduction. As
an extension, literature focused on aligning national disaster risk
management systems to the challenges posed by climate change and
other dynamic drivers of disaster risk places considerable importance on
addressing the underlying drivers of vulnerability as one of the most
effective ‘low or no regrets’ measures (see Figure 6-3 and Table 6-5 in
FAQ 6.1; Tanner and Mitchell, 2008; Davies et al., 2008; CCCD, 2009;
UNISDR, 2009c; Mitchell et al., 2010a). Such underlying drivers of
vulnerability include inequitable development; poverty; declining
ecosystems; lack of access to power, basic services, and land; and weak
governance (Wisner et al., 2004; Schipper 2009; UNISDR 2009c, 201 1b).
An approach to managing disaster risk in the context of a changing
"	Text
"To date, strategies for tackling the risks of climate extremes and
disasters, in practice, have tended to focus on treating the symptoms of
vulnerability, and with it risk, rather than the underlying causes, partly
due to disaster risk management still not being a core component of
sustainable development (Schipper, 2009). The mid-term review of the HFA
indicates that insufficient effort is being made to tackle the conditions that
create risk (UNISDR, 2011b), and other studies have found a continued
disconnect between disaster risk management and development
processes that tackle the structural causes of poverty and vulnerability
and between knowledge and implementation at all scales (CCCD, 2009;
UNISDR, 2009c). The impacts of climate change, both on disaster risk
and on vulnerability and poverty, are viewed by some as a potential
force that will help to forge a stronger connection between disaster risk
reduction measures and poverty and vulnerability reduction measures,
also partly as a result of increased availability of financial resources and
renewed political will (Soussan and Burton, 2002; Schipper, 2009;
Mitchell et al., 2010a). A recent and growing body of literature has
focused on the potential for strengthening the links among particular
forms of social protection, disaster risk reduction, and climate change
adaptation measures as a way to simultaneously tackle the drivers of
vulnerability, poverty, and hence disaster risk (see Section 8.3.1; Davies
et al., 2008; Heltberg et al., 2009). With increasing levels of exposure to
disaster risk in middle-income countries (see Section 6.1; UNISDR,
2009c, 201 1a), reducing vulnerability of poor people and their assets in
such locations is becoming a focus for those governments and for CSOs
and CBOs (Tanner and Mitchell, 2008).

national development planning processes. Incremental efforts toward

mainstreaming of disaster risk management processes into development
planning and practice leads to more resilient development pathways. By
extension, with climate change and other development processes having
an impact on disaster risk, these changes then need to be factored into
development and economic planning decisions at different scales. This
suggests an ideal national system for managing the risks from climate
extremes and disasters would be designed to be fully integrated with
economic and social development, environmental, poverty reduction,
and humanitarian dimensions to create a holistic approach. The nature
of transformational changes in thinking, analysis, planning, approaches,

experience of governments and other actors investing in measures to
respond to existing climate variability and disaster risk that can be
considered as ‘no or low regrets’ options when taking into account the
uncertainty associated with future climate. However, in conducting this
assessment, some knowledge gaps have emerged that, if filled, would
aid the creation of enduring national risk management systems for
tackling observed and projected disaster risk. These gaps include the

and rigid systems (see Section 8.6). This ability to be flexible will be
tested by a systems’ capacity to act on new knowledge generated by
the frequent assessment of dynamic risk needed to capture trends in
exposure vulnerability and weather and climate extremes and by
information on how the costs and benefits of different response measures
change as a result (Section 6.6.1). The accuracy of these assessments
will be based on the quality of available data (Section 6.5.2.1). Where
such assessments generate uncertainty for decisionmakers, tools such

"The international community has accumulated substantial experience in providing help for disasters and
risk management in the context of localized and short-term events associated with climate variability and
extremes. Experience in disaster risk management includes both bottom-up and top-down approaches, but most

international level where needs exceed national capacity, especially in terms of humanitarian assistance and capacity

can make international cooperation on disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation more economically efficient

and climate change adaptation at the international level in part because developing countries are more vulnerable to
physical disasters. [7.2]

is well understood or agreed upon (high confidence). Other areas include international refugee law, which has
been invoked to deal with the displacement of people that might be in part attributed to climate change; human
rights law as used by citizens against states for climate change impacting on the enjoyment of human rights; and the
attempts to expand existing legal doctrines such as the emerging ‘responsibility to protect’ doctrine to motive states
to act on climate change. Such attempts to use tools from other areas of international law to address climate change

"There are two main mechanisms at the international level that are purpose-built and dedicated to disaster
risk management and climate change adaptation. These are the United Nations International Strategy for
Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC),

there are many others that have an international role to play. Page limitations require a selective approach and a
comprehensive assessment of all relevant bodies is impractical. The UNISDR and the UNFCCC are very different
institutions with different mandates and scope and objectives, and with varying strengths and capacities (high
confidence). Up to the present this fact has made the integration of disaster risk management and climate change
adaptation difficult to achieve (medium confidence). [7.3] The evolution of disaster risk management has come
from various directions: from the top down where legislation has required safe practice at operational
levels and from the local level up to the national and international levels. The evolution of climate change
adaptation has been driven primarily by the recognition of the global issue of anthropogenic climate

"A need to cope with the risks associated with atmospheric processes
(floods, droughts, cyclones, and so forth) has always been a fact of human
life (Lamb, 1995). In more recent decades, extreme weather events have
increasingly come to be associated with large-scale disasters and an
increasing level of economic losses (Chapters 2 and 4). Considerable
experience has accumulated at the international (as well as local and
national) level on ways of coping with or managing the risks.

"The international community is thus faced with a contrast between a
long record of managing disasters and the risks of ‘normal’ climate
extremes, and the new problem of adaptation to anthropogenic climate
change and its associated changes in variability and extremes. It has
been asked how the comparatively new field of anthropogenic climate
change adaptation (CCA) can benefit from the longer experience in
disaster risk management (DRM). That question is a major focus of this
Special Report.

"Within the context of the overarching question — how can experience
with disaster risk management inform and help with climate change
adaptation? — there are a series of other related issues to be addressed
in this chapter in order to provide a basis for their closer integration. A
first question concerns the rationale for disaster risk management and
climate change adaptation at the international level. The issues of
systemic risks and international security, economic efficiency, solidarity,
and subsidiarity are addressed in Section 7.2.
"	Text
"Some claim that DRM and CCA could be realized through increased
awareness and use of synergies and differences, and by the provision of
a framework for integration in areas of overlap between the two
(Venton and La Trobe, 2008). The World Conference on Disaster
Reduction held in Kobe (UNISDR, 2005c), Hyogo Prefecture, Japan in
2005 and the Bali Action Plan both point to the need for incorporation
of measures that can reduce climate change impacts within the practice
of disaster risk reduction (DRR). Integration of the relevant aspects of
DRR and CCA can be facilitated by using the Hyogo Framework for
Action (2005-2015) as agreed by 168 governments in Kobe (UNISDR,
2005a).
"	Text
"Climate extremes can have both negative and positive effects. The
occurrence of extreme events has raised consciousness of climate change
within the public and in policymakers. This can then help to enhance a
sense of priority to governmental action in terms of supporting DRM,
enhancing adaptation, and promoting mitigation (Adger et al., 2005).
An international framework for integration of climate-related DRM and
CCA in the development process could provide the potential for reducing
exposure and vulnerability (Thomalla et al., 2006; Venton and La Trobe,
2008). Collective efforts at the international level to reduce greenhouse
gases are a way to reduce long-term exposure to frequent and more
intense climate extremes. International frameworks designed to facilitate
adaptation with a deliberate effort to address issues of equity, technology
transfer, globalization, and the need to meet the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs) can, when combined with mitigation, lead to reduced
vulnerability (Adger et al., 2005; Haines et al., 2006). The 2007/2008 Human
Development Report noted that if climate change is not adequately
addressed now, 40% of the world's poorest (i.e., 2.6 billion people) will
be confined to a future of diminished opportunity (Stern, 2007; Watkins,
2007). The long-term potential to reducing exposure to climate risks lies
in sustainable development (O'Brien et al., 2008). Both seek to build
resilience through sustainable development (O’Brien et al., 2008).

drivers of migration, including climate change risks, rising poverty,
spread of infectious diseases, and conflict (Castles, 2002; Myers, 2005;

downstream. Chastened by the unexpected systemic cascading of the

"The international impacts of climate-related disasters can extend
beyond financial consequences, international trade, and migration, and
affect human security more generally. O’Brien et al. (2008) report on the
intricate and systemic linkages between DRR, CCA, and human security,
and they emphasize the importance of confronting the societal context,
including development levels, governance, inequality, and cultural
practices. A further rationale for disaster risk reduction in the face of
climate change at the international scale thus places emphasis on ethical
issues and the growing connections among people and places in coupled
social-ecological systems.

"A few examples can illustrate the cascading nature of the financial and
economic impacts from disaster. Due to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the
International Energy Agency announced a coordinated drawdown of
European and Asian oil stocks totaling 60 million barrels (Bamberger
and Kumins, 2005), and reportedly oil prices rose not only in the United
States but also as far away as Canada and the United Kingdom.
Disasters also have an impact on international trade. Using a gravity
model across 170 countries (1962-2005), Gassebner et al. (2010)
conclude that an additional disaster reduces imports on average by
0.2% and exports by 0.1%. The main conditions determining the impact
of disastrous events on trade are the level of democracy and the
geographical size of the affected country.
"	Text
"As opposed to abrupt displacement due to extreme weather events,
mobility and migration can also be an adaptation strategy to gradual
climatic change (Barnett and Webber, 2009), which normally leads to
slower migration shifts. However, the very poor and vulnerable will in
many cases be unable to move (Tacoli, 2009). To the extent that weather
extremes contribute to migration, it can result in a huge burden to the
destination areas (Barnett and Adger, 2007; Heltberg et al., 2008;
Morrissey, 2009; Tacoli, 2009; Warner et al., 2009a). As part of this
burden, the conflict potential of migration depends to a significant
degree on how the government and people in the transit, destination,
or place of return respond. Governance, the degree of political stability,
the economy, and whether there is a history of violence are generally
important factors (Kolmannskog, 2008).
"	Text
"The term ‘systemic risk’ refers to risks that are characterized by linkages
and interdependencies in a system, where the failure of a single entity
or cluster of entities can cause cascading impacts on other interlinked
entities. Because of greatly increased international interdependency,
shocks occurring in one country can potentially have major and bi-
directional systemic impacts on other parts of the world (Kleindorfer,
2009), although the full extent of these impacts is not well documented.
Moreover, major interlinked events, such as melting of glaciers, will bring
increased levels of hazard to specific areas, and the initial impacts of
such changes can extend to second- and third-order impacts (Alexander,
2006). This can apply to the contiguous zones of many countries, such as
shared basins with associated flood risks, which calls for transboundary,
international mechanisms (Linnerooth-Bayer et al., 2001).
"	Text
"The public policy literature describes situations in which government
intervention is justified to address market deficiencies and inefficiencies,
a rationale that can also be applied to international interventions. Stern
(2007) makes the case that adaptation will not happen autonomously
because of inefficiencies in resource allocation brought about by missing
and misaligned markets. As a case in point, markets do not allocate
resources efficiently in the case of public goods, which are goods that
meet two conditions: the consumption of the good by one individual
does not reduce availability of the good for consumption by others; and
no one can be effectively excluded from using the good. Tompkins and
Adger (2005) and Berkhout (2005) discuss how some areas, such as
water resources, change from being public to private depending on
national regulations and circumstances. Nevertheless, the principles of
interdependence and public goods suggested by Stern and others (and
which lead to inefficient allocation of resources) are frequently noted in
the literature on international responsibility (Stern, 2007; Vernon, 2008;
Gupta et al., 2010; World Bank, 2010a).

"Early warning systems (as an example of a public good) can depend on
regional and international cooperation to make more efficient use of

years of discussion under the auspices of the World Meteorological
Organization (WMO) have led to formal agreements on the types of
data that are routinely exchanged (WMO, 1995; Basher, 2006). There
are similar levels of agreement in other hazard fields, for instance,
sharing resources and expertise in managing floods at the river basin
scale. As another example of enhanced efficiency through international
cooperation, many Caribbean countries have formed a catastrophe
insurance pool to reduce reinsurance premiums (see Sections 6.3.3 and

can have the effect of perpetuating vulnerability (UNDP, 2002; Bhatt,
2007). For this reason, the DRR and CCA communities are placing great
emphasis on pre-disaster investment and planning to redress this balance
and reduce overall costs of disaster management (Kreimer and Arnold,
2000; Linnerooth-Bayer et al., 2005). These efforts include encouraging
the humanitarian community to become a stronger advocate of DRR

expressed in the Millennium Declaration, especially the goal of eradicating
extreme poverty and hunger (UNDP, 2002; Mirza, 2003; Watkins, 2007;

international intervention in risk management (UNISDR, 2005b;
Heltberg et al., 2008). Barrett et al. (2007) have shown that ex-ante risk
management strategies on the part of the poor commonly sacrifice
expected gains, such as investing in improved seed, to reduce risk of
suffering catastrophic loss, a situation perpetuating the ‘poverty trap.’
The poor can be subject to multiple exposures from climate change
and other stresses like geophysical hazards and changing economic
conditions (e.g., fluctuating exchange rates) leading to vulnerability to
even moderate hazard events (O’Brien and Leichenko, 2000).

"Shared responsibility and common human concern have been articulated
most effectively with regard to post-disaster humanitarian assistance,
and the Millennium Declaration gives specific mention to ‘natural’
disasters in this context. Section VI (Protecting the Vulnerable) states: “We
will spare no effort to ensure that children and all civilian populations
that suffer disproportionately the consequences of natural disasters ...
are given every assistance and protection so that they can resume normal
life as soon as possible.” With growing globalization the principle of
shared responsibility is further enhanced as offers of disaster relief may
provide nations access to new spheres of influence both politically and
in terms of new business opportunities. Governments can piggyback a
humanitarian effort on top of a for-profit operation involving private
companies (Dunfee and Hess, 2000).

"In the poorest countries, people have a higher burden in terms of loss of
life per event and loss of their assets relative to their income. Based on
historical loss data from Munich Re, average fatalities for major disaster
events have been approximately 40 times higher in low-income as
compared to high-income countries (groupings according to the World
Bank), and direct asset losses as a percentage of gross national income
have averaged three times greater (Barnett et al., 2008; Linnerooth-
Bayer et al, 2010). Changes in frequency, magnitude, and spatial coverage
of some climate extremes (see Table 3-1) can result in losses that exceed
the capability of many individual countries to manage the risk
(Rodriguez et al., 2009). Many have concluded that without significant
international assistance the most vulnerable countries will have difficulty
in adapting to changes in extreme events and their impacts due to climate
change, as well as other impacts of climate change (Agrawala and
Fankhauser, 2008; Agrawala and van Aalst, 2008; Klein and Persson,
2008; Klein and Mohner, 2009; Gupta and van de Grijp, 2010; Gupta et

At the same time as international law appears to provide a normative
framework and to create an obligation to “implement ... measures to

the literature suggests that taken together, international legal instruments

disaster risk. To illustrate, the law of international disaster response,

the Rio Declaration; UNCED, 1992). The CBDR is discussed further in
Section 7.2.5. For purposes here it is important to note that, while
the CBDR principle can apply to climate change in general, including
incremental change, it is relevant to climate-related disasters only if there
is evidence or reason to believe that the disaster would not have occurred
or would have been less severe in the absence of climate change.

"In addition to international sources of ‘hard law,’ ‘soft law’ principles
also exist in the form of non-legally binding resolutions, guidelines,
codes of conduct (Chinkin, 1989; Bodansky, 2010), and other non-legally
binding instruments adopted by states. Collectively, hard law and soft
law provide a framework within which states have obligations (hard
law) or commitments (soft law) of relevance to adapting to climate
change and disaster risk management. These include obligations to
mitigate the effects of drought (United Nations Convention to Combat
Desertification), to formulate and implement measures to facilitate
adaptation (UNFCCC; see Section 7.3.2), to exercise precaution (Rio

"Another set of literature (e.g., Adger et al., 2009; Caney, 2010) frames
equity issues around climate change in terms of ‘rights,’ namely the right
‘not to suffer from dangerous climate change’ or ‘to avoid dangerous
climate change’ (Adger, 2004; Caney, 2008). The ‘rights’ argument,
which is highly relevant to international solidarity, can be extended to
suggest that individuals and collectives have the right to be protected
from risk and disaster imposed by others through the processes that
lead to social exclusion, marginality, exposure, and vulnerability.
According to this literature, climate change impacts can jeopardize
fundamental rights to life and livelihood (such as impacts on disease
burden, malnutrition, and food security). Caney (2010, p. 83) also
discusses a potential further undeniable right, ‘not to be forcibly
evicted.’ This framing, however, raises a number of difficult issues
because of competing fundamental rights (O’Brien et al., 2009).

"The principle of ‘subsidiarity’ can be invoked to support a case against
international intervention. It is best known as articulated in Article 5 of
the Treaty of Maastricht on European Union (Maastricht Treaty, 1992). It
is based on the concept that centralized governing structures should
only take action if deemed more effective or necessary than action at
lower levels (Jordan, 2000; Craeynest et al., 2010). The intent is to
strengthen accountability and reduce the dangers of making decisions
in places remote from their point of application (Gupta and Grubb,
2000). In Europe, the principle of subsidiarity has been interpreted to
mean, for example, that international- or national-level involvement in
flood protection should only apply to cross-border catchments (Stoiber,
2006). While many regions and river basins are required to develop risk
management flood plans, flood protection is considered predominantly
a national, and in many countries (e.g., Germany and India), primarily a
sub-national (state) responsibility.

"Contemporary international law concerns the coexistence of states in
times of war and of peace (19th-century conception of international
law, rooted in the Westphalian system), the relationship between a state
and citizens (e.g., human rights law), and the cooperation between
states and other international actors in order to achieve common goals
and address common concerns (e.g., international environmental law).
International law, according to the authoritative Article 38 of the Statute
of the International Court of Justice, emanates from three primary
sources: (1) international conventions, which establish “rules expressly
recognized by the ... states,” and result from a deliberate process of
negotiations; (2) international custom, “as evidence of a general practice
accepted as law”; and (3) general principles of law, “recognized by
civilized nations” (see also Birnie et al., 2009). This triumvirate of
conventional and customary international law, and general principles of
law, contains legal norms and obligations that can be used to motivate,
justify, and facilitate international cooperation on climate change
adaptation, such as contained within the UNFCCC, and in anticipation
of and response to natural disasters, such as with the emerging field of

"Few internationally negotiated treaties deal, at the international level,
with managing risk associated with climate extremes or with adaptation
to climate change. As the primary treaty to address climate-related risk
management at the international level, the UNFCCC commits Parties to
facilitate adequate adaptation, to cooperate with planning for extreme
weather, and to consider insurance schemes, though at present it is
unresolved as to whether this implies international insurance schemes.
Specifically, in Article 4.1(b), Parties to the UNFCCC agree to “formulate,
implement, publish and regularly update national and, where appropriate,
regional programmes containing ... measures to facilitate adequate
adaptation to climate change.” In Article 4.1(e), Parties agree to
“cooperate in preparing for adaptation to the impacts of climate change;
develop and elaborate appropriate and integrated plans for coastal zone
management, water resources and agriculture, and for the protection
and rehabilitation of areas, particularly in Africa, affected by drought and
desertification, as well as floods.” Article 4.8 of the UNFCCC commits
Parties to consider actions “including related to funding, insurance and
the transfer of technology” to meet the specific needs and concerns of
developing countries. In Article 3.14, UNFCCC's Kyoto Protocol considers
the establishment of funding, insurance, and transfer of technology (see
also Sections 7.4.2, 7.4.3, and 7.4.4).

"The precautionary principle states that scientific uncertainty does not
justify inaction with respect to environmental risks (Trouwborst, 2002),
and is articulated in a number of international instruments including
Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration, and Article 3 of the UNFCCC. That
states have a duty to prevent transboundary harm, provide notice of, and
undertake consultations with respect to such potential harms is a soft
law norm expressed under international environmental law. The more
general duty to cooperate has evolved as a result of the inapplicability
of the law of state responsibility to problems of multilateral concern,
such as global environmental challenges. The Office of the High
Commissioner for Human Rights has noted that “climate change can
only be effectively addressed through cooperation of all members of the
international community” (OHCHR, 2009). From the duty to cooperate
is deduced a duty to notify other states of potential environmental
harm. This is reflected in Principles 18 and 19 of the Rio Declaration (a
non-legal international instrument), that “States shall immediately notify
other States of any natural disasters or other emergencies that are likely
to produce sudden harmful effects on the environment of those States”
(Rio Principle 18) and “States shall provide prior and timely notification
and relevant information to potentially affected States on activities that
may have a significant adverse transboundary environmental effect”
(Rio Principle 19).

"reality of various customs and principles that justify or mandate
international action on disaster risk reduction and climate change
adaptation. To be established as customary law, two elements are
requisite: evidence of generally uniform and continuous state practice
(regular behavior), and evidence that this practice is motivated by a sense
of legal obligation (opinio juris) (Bodansky, 1995). Soft law principles of
law, by contrast, are not customary norms and do not reflect behavioral
regularities. They are rather an articulation of collective aspiration,
important in shaping the “development of international law and
negotiations to develop more precise norms” (Bodansky, 2010, p. 200).
In practice, the distinction between rules of customary law (reflecting
actual practice of states following a legal obligation) and soft law
principles is frequently blurred. For instance, the principle of common but
differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities - which would
for example suggest that states have differentiated responsibilities in
addressing disaster risk and financing adaptation — is increasingly
supported by state practice, however opinio juris is lacking as it is unclear
whether most states consider the principle to be a legal obligation. The
principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective
capabilities might thus fall closer to a general principle than a customary
norm. Irrespective of this status, the principle of common but differentiated
responsibilities and respective capabilities is nevertheless a principle
that states may apply in their international relations, even if it is not a
norm of customary international law.

particularly within hazard-prone developing countries, took place in
1989, when the United Nations (UN) General Assembly designated the
1990s as the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction

Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR), which broadened the technical
and policy scope of the IDNDR to include increased social action, public
commitment, and linkages to sustainable development. The UNISDR
system promotes tools and methods to reduce disaster risk while
encouraging collaboration between disaster reduction and climate
change. The UNISDR Secretariat provides information and guidance on
disaster risk reduction and has increasingly widened its focus to embrace
adaptation to climate change. The strategy undertakes global reviews of
disaster risk and promotes national initiatives to reduce disaster risk.
The UNISDR has also promoted the development of National Platforms.
A key function is to assist in the compilation, exchange, analysis, and
dissemination of good practices and lessons learned in disaster risk
reduction (refer to Section 7.4.5).

"International human rights norms as articulated in the International Bill
of Human Rights have also been applied to disaster risk reduction and
adaptation to climate change. Notably, the Report of the Office of the
High Commission for Human Rights observes that climate change and
response measures thereto can have a negative effect on the realization
of human rights including rights to life, adequate food, water, health,
adequate housing, and self-determination (OHCHR, 2009). These rights
could risk being jeopardized when contemplated, for example, in the
context of migration induced by extreme weather events. As discussed
in Section 7.3.1, the HFA further stipulates key tasks for governments
and multi-stakeholder actors; among these is the development of legal
frameworks (UNISDR, 2005a, para. 22). The HFA is an international
framework, a priority area of which is to ensure that disaster risk reduction
is a national priority with an institutional basis for implementation. As
to adaptation, the Bali Action Plan agreed to at the 13th Conference of
the Parties to the UNFCCC recognizes the need to address consideration
of disaster reduction strategies and risk management within adaptation
(UNFCCC, 2007a). Adaptation is further addressed in the Cancun

development policies and planning; development and strengthening of
institutions, mechanisms, and capacities to build resilience to hazards;
and the systematic incorporation of risk reduction approaches into the

recovery programs (UNISDR, 2005a). The Framework also provides five
Priorities for Action:

"The priorities address all hazards with a multi-hazard approach, hence
the inclusion of climate change risks and adaptation, but they do not
specify the need to factor climate change risks and adaptation into
ongoing action. The HFA does identify ‘critical tasks’ for varied actors,
including states who are to “promote the integration of DRR with climate
variability and climate change into DRR strategies and adaptation to
climate change” (UNISDR 2005a; see also UNISDR, 2009a, 2011a,b;

review of progress in achieving the HFA (UNISDR, 2011b). Further tools
to measure progress include the reports to the biennial sessions of the
Global Platform for DRR and the regional platforms for DRR and other
similar mechanisms. The World Bank and the United Nations

"Countries have been making improvements toward increasing capacity,
developing institutional systems, and legislation to promote DRR, and
early warning systems have been implemented in many areas. However,
the Global Assessment Reports (UNISDR, 2009a, 2011a) conclude that
progress is still required to mainstream DRR into public investment,
development planning, and governance arrangements. During 2010, at
the mid-point in the HFA, the UN Secretary General echoed this concern
in reporting that “risk reduction is still not hardwired into the ‘business
processes’ of the development sectors, planning ministries and financial
institutions” (UNGA, 2010, p. 5).

"The GNDR observed that ecosystem management approaches can provide
multiple benefits, including risk reduction, and thus be a central part of
DRR strategies. But countries have experienced difficulty in addressing
underlying risk drivers (such as food security, social protection, building
codes/standards, poverty alleviation, poor urban and local governance,
vulnerable rural livelihoods, and ecosystem decline) in a way that leads
to a reduction in the risk of damages and economic loss (GNDR, 2009).
This Fourth HFA Priority for Action — ‘Reduce the Underlying Risk Factors’
— remains the greatest challenge to civil society bodies, with all 13
criteria only reaching a rating of 2 on the assessment scale: ‘some activity
but significant scope for improvements’ (GNDR, 2009, pp. 24-26). The

"The measurement of performance in the implementation of DRR was a
matter of considerable debate when the HFA was drafted. The consensus
was for the final text not to include targets or indicators of progress, but
countries were encouraged to develop their own guidelines to monitor
their own progress in reducing their risks. To assist this process, in 2008,
UNISDR published guidance notes on ‘Indicators of Progress’ (UNISDR,
2008). This provided the template for self-assessment that is used in
national reports. While there is an obvious value in ‘self-assessment’ as
a learning experience, in the absence of external, objective evaluation,
inevitable doubts will always remain concerning such internal reporting
on actual progress with DRR and CCA.

"As a result of the adoption of HFA, and the development of performance
indicators, global efforts to address DRR have become more systematic.
In 2009, the first biennial Global Assessment Report (GAR) on Disaster
Risk Reduction was released and in the same year the Global Network
of Civil Society Organisations for Disaster Reduction (GNDR) also
released a report on the performance of the HFA (GNDR, 2009). The GAR
found that since the adoption of the HFA, progress toward decreasing
disaster risk is varied across scales. This variation is based on national
government agencies self-assessment of progress against the indicators
defined by the UNISDR (UNISDR, 2008) and since many of these indicators
require a subjective assessment, progress is not directly comparable
across countries.

countries to address underlying risk drivers using an assortment of

"However, it is important to reflect on the reality that all of these methods
to review international progress in risk reduction — country progress
reports, the 2009 and 2011 GARs, the reports of the GNDR, and the
Mid-Term Review of the HFA — are all internally produced reports by the
participating agencies with external advisory boards and peer review,
but all involving self-assessment. The GNDR's publications are fully

performance in international coordination and its focus on national-level
responses rather than its global mandate, which is broad rather than

strategic considerations as well as leadership failures, with the report

"All the above studies attempted to assess HFA performance and, as
noted above, none were totally separate from the work or institutions

of the lead organization, UNISDR, in comparison with other multilateral
bodies. This report came in 2011, when the UK Aid Agency, the
Department for International Development (DFID), published a
Multilateral Aid Review. The purpose was to ensure maximum value for
money for UK aid by examining the performance of 43 multilateral
organizations. This peer-reviewed assessment placed the UNISDR in a
43rd-ranked position in an assessment of 43 multilateral organizations
(DFID, 2011).

"When evaluating the progress of HFA on each of its five Priorities for
Action, the GNDR found that the lowest level of progress across all the
five priorities was at the lowest scale in community participation in
decisionmaking on DRR (GNDR, 2009). These findings also indicate the
need for a stronger link between policy formulation at international and
national levels to policy execution at local levels. Rapid progress has
been made in the development of comprehensive seasonal and long-
term early warning systems (EWS) to anticipate droughts, floods, and
tropical storms. These systems have proved to be effective in saving
lives and protecting property. In the 2009 GAR, the status of EWS was
reviewed (UNISDR, 2009a, Box 5.2 on p. 127). This was based on a
detailed progress review of EWS undertaken by WMO (WMO, 2009).
Typical examples of the effectiveness of EWS in reducing the impact of
cyclones and flooding can be found in Mozambique, where their EWS
was first tested in a cyclone in 2007 (Foley, 2007) and in Bangladesh,
where the flood and cyclone EWS has been progressively developed
over three decades (Paul et al., 2010; also see Case Study 9.2.11).

"It was also acknowledged in the 2009 GAR that weather-related disaster
tisk is escalating swiftly, in terms of the regions affected, frequency
of events, and losses reported. This frequency relates to occurrence
patterns as well as improved reporting of all categories of weather-
related hazards. Data was collected from a sample of 12 Asian and Latin
American countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador,
the Indian states of Orissa and Tamil Nadu, Iran, Mexico, Nepal, Peru,
Sri Lanka, and Venezuela. The report further noted that these increases
will magnify the uneven distribution of risk between wealthier and
poorer countries (UNISDR, 2009a, p. 11). Furthermore, a conclusion is
drawn in the report that climate change is changing the geographical
distribution, intensity, and frequency of these weather-related hazards,
threatening to exceed the capacities of poorer countries and their
communities’ abilities to absorb losses and recover from disaster
impacts (UNISDR, 2009b). However, the 2011 GAR reported significant
progress with a decrease in global mortality risk from tropical cyclones and
flooding, with the only exception being South Asia where vulnerability
is still increasing (UNISDR, 201 1a, p. 28).

template so reports vary widely in content, making aggregation or

countries to assess their progress toward meeting their commitments

"Whatever method is adopted to monitor progress with risk reduction
and climate change adaptation (internal or external, self-assessment or
peer review), the implicit problems faced in the measurement of DRR
and CCA before a disaster event must be recognized. It is not easy, even
with detailed objective scientific measurement, to accurately determine
whether a given structural or non-structural measure will actually
provide the necessary level of protection to people and property under
extreme hazard loads. Structural tests can be carried out and simulation
exercises can be usefully conducted to test warning systems or the
effectiveness of preparedness, but at best such performance tests can
only approximate disaster reality. The ultimate test of DRR and CCA
applications will inevitably need to await the impact of the next disaster.
But this limitation does not remove the requirement to monitor and

of existing knowledge (Davis, 2004).

"Since 2001, a number of successive decisions have given increasing
priority to climate change adaptation under the UNFCCC. Decision
1/CP.10 built on Decision 5/CP.7; it reiterated the need for support for
adaptation in developing countries and started a regional consultation
process. Decision 2/CP.11 then established the Nairobi Work Programme
on impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation to climate change, which
originally ran from 2006 to 2010 — a next phase is currently under
consideration, to be decided at COP17 in Durban in 2011. The objective
of the Nairobi Work Programme is to assist all Parties, in particular
developing countries, (i) to improve their understanding and assessment
of impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation to climate change, and (ii) to
make informed decisions on practical adaptation actions and measures
to respond to climate change on a sound scientific, technical, and
socioeconomic basis, taking into account current and future climate
change and variability (Decision 2/CP.11). The Nairobi Work Programme
is implemented by Parties, intergovernmental and nongovernmental
organizations, the private sector, communities, and other stakeholders.
Several of the nine work areas of the Nairobi Work Programme are
relevant to DRR as well as CCA, in particular ‘climate-related risks and
extreme events’ and ‘adaptation planning and practices.’

development, including “enhancing climate change related disaster risk
reduction strategies, taking into consideration the Hyogo Framework for
Action where appropriate; early warning systems; risk assessment and

at local, national, sub-regional, and regional levels, as appropriate.” In
addition, Decision 1/CP.16 established (i) a process to enable least-
developed countries and other developing countries to formulate and
implement national adaptation plans; (ii) an Adaptation Committee that
will, among other things, provide technical support, share relevant
information, promote synergies, and make recommendations on finance,

"The main coordination mechanism for DRR, contributing to DRM, is the
UNISDR, designed to develop a system of partnerships to support
nations and communities to reduce disaster risk. These partners include
governments, intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations,
international financial institutions, scientific and technical bodies and
specialized networks as well as civil society and the private sector.
Among the diverse range of stakeholders across scales, the national
governments play the most important roles, including developing
national coordination mechanisms; conducting baseline assessments on
the status of disaster risk reduction; publishing and updating summaries
of national programs; reviewing national progress toward achieving the
objectives and priorities of the Hyogo Framework; working to implement
relevant international legal instruments; and integrating disaster risk
reduction with climate change strategies. Intergovernmental organizations
play a supporting role, including, for example, promotion of DRR programs
and integration into development planning, and capacity building
(UNISDR, 2005b). The fact that the primary roles in planning and
implementation are played by national governments, while the UNISDR
Secretariat and other intergovernmental organizations provide supporting,
monitoring, and information sharing roles at the regional and global
level is consistent with the principle of subsidiarity.

parties and organizations to specify their own contributions to CCA
through ‘action pledges,’ and for sharing, synthesis, and dissemination
of information. Disaster risk reduction is well represented within the
NWP, which identifies DRR as one of its 14 specified adaptation delivery
activities, with an associated ‘call to action’ for strengthened work in
areas such as linking DRR and CCA, risk mapping, and cost-benefit
analysis of adaptation options. Out of the 137 action pledges made by
partners, 59 include a component of DRR. Evaluation of the NWP by Parties
is only now being carried out, so as yet there is no formal assessment

"In response to the need for a comprehensive approach to climate
variability and change, and the drive for more demand-driven climate
services the, World Climate Conference-3 agreed in 2009 to begin
development of a Global Framework on Climate Services (GFCS) (WMO,
2010). This has a goal of “the development and provision of relevant
science-based climate information and prediction for climate risk
management and adaptation to climate variability and change,
throughout the world.” The framework therefore explicitly links climate
variability (most relevant to DRR), in the context of climate change
(most relevant to CCA), and support for risk management decisions
(common to both). The GFCS has four major components: a User
Interaction Mechanism; a World Climate Services System; Climate
Research; and Observation and Monitoring. The initiative will focus on
improving access and operational use of climate information, especially
in vulnerable, developing countries. The principles and focus of the
initiative therefore correspond closely to the objectives of linking DRM
and CCA in operational planning across international and smaller
scales. In May 2011, the 16th WMO congress committed to “support
and facilitate the implementation of the GFCS as a priority of the
Organization,” including the development of an implementation plan
for review and adoption in 2012 (WMO, 2011).

of international development, and the target date of the Hyogo Framework for Action coincides with the intended completion of the

MDGs (UNISDR, 2005b).

supported by international aid agreements, such as the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative to cancel US$ 40 to 55 million dollars’ worth of
debt (IMF, 2011), and the commitment of economically advanced countries to commit 0.7% of gross national income to overseas
development aid (UN ,1970). The eight MDGs break down into 21 quantifiable targets that are measured by 60 indicators (UN, 2011).

"Vulnerability to extreme weather and to climate change is strongly conditioned by socioeconomic development, including income levels
and distribution, supportive institutional frameworks, and the capacities of specific sectors. Conversely, the effects of climate change,
including through any increase in the frequency of extreme weather events, can also set back economic development (Stern, 2007).
Countries that are relatively poor, isolated, and reliant on a narrow range of economic activities are particularly vulnerable to such
shocks (UNISDR, 2009a). The objectives of climate change adaptation, disaster risk reduction, and sustainable development are therefore
intricately linked, and while the HFA and UNFCCC are the main international frameworks for CCA and DRR, a wider range of other
governance and institutional mechanisms have a major influence. These range, for example, from the agreements of the World Trade
Organization (affecting development and potentially technology transfer for adaptation; WTO, 2011), to the International Health
Regulations (affecting the way that epidemics of climate-sensitive infectious diseases such as cholera are managed across borders; WHO,
2007), to the codes of practice of international humanitarian organizations (such as the Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross
and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief; ICRC, 1995).

relatively crude relationships and make strong assumptions, such as
perfect foresight and high levels of autonomous adaptation. Almost

"A controversial candidate field for expanded interpretation is international
refugee law. The extant definition of ‘refugee’ per the Refugee Convention
and Protocol is any person who is outside their country of nationality
and who, “owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted” is unable
or unwilling to return to their country. Some literature proposes the
expansion of ‘persecuted’ to encompass being subject to environmental
disaster or degradation (Warnock, 2007; Kolmannskog and Myrstad,
2009). Comparably, Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights prohibits torture and “cruel, inhuman, or degrading
punishment.” Some literature notes the potential expansion of the
meaning ‘inhuman treatment’ to include being left without basic levels
of subsistence due to climate change impacts. A step further proposes a
new international agreement to share the “emerging burden of climate-
induced migration flows” and which “upholds the human rights of the
individuals affected” (Von Doussa et al., 2007). The expansion of the
definition of refugee remains highly controversial, with many states
opposing the use of refugee law to address climate-related, transboundary

"The UNFCCC recognizes that in addition to the need to mitigate
emissions of greenhouse gases and adapt to climate change, there is a
responsibility on developed countries to support developing countries in
this process (see Article 4.4 in Box 7-1). A starting point for the delivery
of adaptation finance is the assessment of adaptation finance needs,
which have also been interpreted as a proxy for adaptation costs (see
Section 4.5). The UNFCCC (2007b) estimated the additional investment
and financial flows needed worldwide to be US$ 48 to 171 billion in 2030
(or US$ 60 to 193 billion when also considering current investment needs
for ecosystem adaptation). Some US$ 28 to 67 billion of this amount
would be needed in developing countries (UNFCCC, 2007b). The largest
uncertainty in these estimates is in the cost of adapting infrastructure,
which may require anything between US$ 8 and 130 billion in 2030,
one-third of which would be for developing countries. The UNFCCC
(2007b) also estimated that an additional amount of about US$ 41
billion would be needed for agriculture, water, health, and coastal zone
protection, most of which would be used in developing countries. Other
studies providing estimates of the annual incremental costs of adaptation
in developing countries include those by the World Bank (2006), Stern

adaptation investment. Double counting between sectors and scaling

money for adaptation is provided through several other channels,

that is highly fragmented, resulting in a proliferation not only of funds but

finance needs that have been identified. The GEF operates the LDCF and
SCCF, to provide funding to eligible developing countries to meet the
‘additional’ or ‘incremental’ costs of adaptation; the baseline costs of a
project or program are borne by the recipient country, by other bilateral
or multilateral donors, or both. The LDCF and SCCF rely on voluntary
contributions from developed countries. As of May 2010, US$ 315 million
had been pledged for adaptation under these two funds (US$ 221 million
to the LDCF and US$ 94 million to the SCCF); of this amount, US$ 220
million has been allocated (US$ 135 million from the LDCF and US$ 85

"In addition to these global estimates, total adaptation finance needs can
also be assessed by aggregating national estimates, although this is
hampered by the absence of a common method to make such estimates,
and the fact that they are not available for all countries. The NAPAs (see
Section 7.3.2 and Chapter 6), which have now been completed by most
LDCs, are the most extensive effort to date to assess adaptation priorities
and finance needs in developing countries. The cumulative cost of
projects prioritized to respond to urgent and immediate adaptation
needs is approximately US$ 1,660 million for the 43 countries that had
completed their NAPAs by September 2009 (UNFCCC, 2010b). The
divergence from the global estimates mentioned above can be
explained by several factors: they cover only 43 LDCs, they include only
prioritized projects, and they consider only urgent and immediate
adaptation needs, not medium- to long-term needs (Persson et al., 2009).

"While the GEF-managed funds have supported adaptation activities in
some 80 countries (Persson et al., 2009), there has been criticism,
particularly from developing countries, on how the funds are being
managed (e.g., Mitchell et al., 2008; Klein and Méhner, 2009; Ministry
of Foreign Affairs of Denmark and GEF Evaluation Office, 2009). In
addition, concern has been voiced about the predictability and adequacy
of funds, and the perceived equity and fairness of decisionmaking (Mace,
2005; Paavola and Adger, 2006; Miller, 2007; Persson et al., 2009). The
GEF has acknowledged the criticism and indicated in reports to the
COP how it is responding to it (GEF, 2009, 2010b). At the same time,
developed countries have raised concern about fiduciary risks in some
developing countries, which would need to be addressed through
improved accountability and transparency before program-based
adaptation can be supported by international finance (Mitchell et al.,
2008; GEF, 2010b). The Adaptation Fund has not been operational long
enough to allow for such an assessment but the first signals are positive,
particularly regarding its governance structure and the option of direct

"An open question is how climate finance might be linked with other
international finance flows. The Bali Action Plan referred to “means to
incentivize the implementation of adaptation actions on the basis of
sustainable development policies” in its section on the provision of
financial resources. The Copenhagen Accord did not discuss the link
between adaptation and development, even though the issue of
‘mainstreaming’ — integrating adaptation to climate change into
mainstream development planning and decisionmaking — was much
debated in the pre-Copenhagen negotiations on adaptation finance
(Persson et al., 2009; Klein, 2010). From an operational perspective,
mainstreaming adaptation into development makes common sense:
both contribute to enhancing human security, and opportunities to
create synergies between the two are increasingly recognized and
pursued (Gigli and Agrawala, 2007; Klein et al., 2007; Kok et al., 2008;
Gupta and Van de Grijp, 2010). Besides, there is a range of activities
that can be seen as contributing to both adaptation and development
objectives (McGray et al., 2007).
"	Text
"But from a climate policy perspective, mainstreaming creates a dilemma
(Persson and Klein, 2009; Klein, 2010). Financial flows for adaptation
and those for development — for example, official development assistance
(ODA) — are managed separately. One of the arguments in favor of
mainstreamed adaptation is that it makes more efficient use of financial
and human resources than adaptation that is designed, implemented,
and managed as stand-alone activities (ie, separately from ongoing
development planning and decisionmaking). However, developing
countries have expressed the concern that, as a result of donors seeking
to create synergies between adaptation and development, finance for
adaptation will not be new and additional but in effect will be absorbed
into ODA budgets of a fixed size (Michaelowa and Michaelowa, 2007).
The concern is fueled by the fact that the amount of money currently
available for adaptation falls short of the estimated adaptation finance
needs in developing countries. A second, related concern is that
mainstreaming could divert any new and additional funds for adaptation
into more general development activities, thus limiting the opportunity
to evaluate, at least quantitatively, their benefits with respect to climate
change specifically (Yamin, 2005). Third, there is concern that donors’ use
of ODA to pursue mainstreamed adaptation could impose conditionalities
on what should be a country-driven process (Gupta et al., 2010).

"Technologies receive prominent attention both in adaptation to emerging
and future impacts of climate change as well as in mitigating current
disasters. The sustainability, operation, and maintenance of technologies
can be challenging in many developing countries due to lack of
resources, human capacity, and cultural differences. Moreover, technology
transfer is complex and requires capacity building as well as a client
(technology user) focus as opposed to a developer (technology designer)
focus (O'Brien et al., 2007). Intellectual property rights are rarely an
issue in the availability and use of technologies for adaptation (Murphy,
2011) but when they are, adequate methods are needed that foster
affordable deployment of new technologies but preserve the incentives
for technology developers (Doig, 2008). While the importance of
transferring technologies from developers/owners to would-be users is
widely recognized, the bulk of the literature seems to address the issues
at a rather generic level, without going into the details of what
technologies for adaptation would need to be transferred in different
impact sectors from where to where and via what mechanisms.
Institutional, political, technological, economic, information, financial,
cultural, legal, and participation and consultation obstacles can hinder
the transfer of mitigation and adaptation technologies and concerted
efforts are required to overcome those impediments (IEA, 2001). Private-
public partnership as a policy instrument could well be a mechanism
for transferring the required technologies for adaptation projects
(Agrawala and Fankhauser, 2008). In the adaptation literature,
publications addressing the transfer of technologies important for
reducing vulnerability and increasing the ability to cope with weather-
related disasters are even scarcer. This section reviews literature on
technologies for adaptation and the issues involved in international

Curiously, only one country mentioned ‘potential for adaptation’ among
the commonly used criteria for prioritizing technology needs. Among
30 technologies listed in the report, the technology needs relevant for
coping and adapting to weather extremes include, for example,
improved drainage, emergency planning, raising buildings and land, and
protecting against sea level rise. Many of these are good examples of
measures that link DRR and CCA objectives, namely to reduce overall
ecological and social vulnerability. Another UNFCCC report (2006b)
observes that, unlike those for mitigation, the forms of technology for
adaptation are often rather familiar. Many have been used over
generations in coping with floods, for example, by building houses on
stilts or by cultivating floating vegetable plots. Some other types of
technologies draw on new developments in, for example, advanced
materials science and satellite remote sensing (see Box 7-3). The

coastal system adaptation include various types of geospatial information
technologies such as mapping and surveying, videography, airborne
laser scanning (lidar), satellite and airborne remote sensing, global
positioning systems in addition to tide gauges and historical and
geological methods. These technologies help formulate adaptation
strategies (protection versus retreat), implement the selected strategy
(design, construction, and operation), and provide early warning
(UNFCCC, 2006a). Another set of examples includes technologies to
protect against sea level rise: dikes, levees, floodwalls, seawalls,
revetments, bulkheads, groynes, detached breakwaters, floodgates, tidal
barriers, and saltwater intrusion barriers among the hard structural
options, and periodic beach nourishment, dune restoration and creation,

"In Asia, adaptation to climate change, variability, and extreme events at the community level are small scale and concentrate mainly on
agriculture, water, and disaster amelioration (Alam et al., 2007). They focus on the livelihood of affected communities, raise awareness to
change practices, diversify agriculture, and promote water conservation. For example, Saudi Arabia has already built 215 dams for water
storage and 30 desalination plants, passed water protection and conservation laws, and initiated leakage detection and control schemes
as well as advanced irrigation water conservation schemes and a system for modified water pumping as part of its climate change
adaptation program (Alam et al., 2007). In India, a combination of traditional and innovative technological approaches is used to manage
drought risk. Technological management of drought (e.g., development and use of drought tolerant cultivars, shifting cropping seasons
in agriculture, flood and drought control techniques in water management) is combined with model-based seasonal and annual to
decadal forecasts. Model results are translated into early warning in order to take appropriate drought protection measures (Alam et al.,
2007). In China, adaptation technologies have been widely used for flood disaster mitigation (Alam et al., 2007). Another example is
related to the Philippines where a typhoon in 1987 completely destroyed over 200,000 homes. The Department of Social Welfare and
Development initiated a program of providing typhoon-resistant housing for the population in the most typhoon-prone areas (Diacon,
1992). The so-called Core Shelter houses have typhoon resistant features and can endure wind speeds up to 180 km hr. The technology
was proved to be successful by providing the required protection and was adopted recently in regions stricken by a landslide

multi-hazard warning and warnings on vulnerability development to the
extent it is possible. Satellite and aerial monitoring, meteorological
models, and computer tools including geographic information systems

essential technical components. (The focus on technology here does not
negate the importance of social and communication aspects of early

important in the United States. The benefits of using GIS technologies
include informing the public, enabling officials to make smarter decisions,
and facilitating first-responder efforts to effectively locate and rescue

information about projected changes in extreme weather events
remains an important constraint in managing weather-related disasters,

are relevant for adaptation: results of the penetration of energy and
industrial technologies in the developing countries depend on many
factors ranging from labor skills, market conditions, achieved level of
technological development, the reliability of basic services (electricity
and water), availability of spare parts, etc. A combination of interrelated
socioeconomic, institutional, and governance issues would often
determine the success or failure of technology transfer, rather than the
technologies themselves (Klein et al., 2005, p. 23). These factors are also

remittances are carried by hand (Savage and Harvey, 2007). While simple
in concept, remittances can be complicated by associated transfer fees.
A survey carried out in the United Kingdom found that for an average-
sized transfer, the associated costs could vary between 2.5 and 40%

an unfamiliar language, and transfers across some borders have been
complicated due to initiatives taken by developed nations to counter
international money laundering and terrorism financing (Fagen and

1980s, the World Bank has thus initiated over 500 loans for recovery and
reconstruction with a total disbursement of more than US$ 40 billion

maintain, and upgrade these systems (Saab et al., 2008). ICT is also
limited to explicit knowledge that is comprised of, for example, documents
and data stored in computers but generally lacks tacit knowledge that
is based on experience linked to someone's expertise, competence,
understanding, professional intuition, and so forth that can be valuable
for disaster relief (Kaklauskas et al., 2009). Increased international
collaboration on disaster management and also the growing use of
interactive web communication facilities provides for the filtering of
tacit knowledge.

"Increased use of ICT such as mobile phones, online blogging websites
with interactive functions and links to other web pages and real-time
crowd-sourcing electronic commentary, and other forms of web-based
social-networked communications such as Twitter, Facebook, etc.,
represent current tools for timely information dissemination. They
facilitate rapid exchange of information, for instance, from the disaster
scene to rescuers and/or delivery of vital information to those affected. This
is particularly the case where such information is given in an appropriate
format and language and facilities to deliver information are accessible
(Glik, 2007). There are emerging attempts to develop mobile phone-
based disaster response services, for example, that can translate disaster
information into different languages (Hasegawa et al., 2005); and use
real-time mobile phone-calling data to provide information on location
and movement of victims in a disaster area (Madey et al., 2007). Mobile
phones are now routinely used to disseminate disaster warning information
within industrialized countries and the process is rapidly expanding to
developing countries.

"In addition to disaster management organizations such as UNISDR, the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, national Red Cross and Red
Crescent societies, and so forth, a great deal of knowledge dissemination
is accomplished in the academic field. But this knowledge does not
translate automatically to the general public. The use of ICTs such as
computer networks, digital libraries, satellite communications, remote
sensing, grid technology, and GIS for data and information integration
for knowledge acquisition and exchange is growing to be important in
integrating DRR and CCA (UNISDR, 2005b; Louhisuo et al., 2007; see
also Section 7.4.3.2). ICT offers interactive modes of learning that could
be of value in distance education and online data sharing and retrieval.
For example, the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters
(CRED) at the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium maintains the
Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT), which has over 18,000 entries
on disasters in the world dated from 1900 to present (www.cred.be).
The data are recorded on a country-level basis and form a useful
resource for disaster preparedness and vulnerability assessments,
although information on small-scale disasters is difficult to establish
(Tschoeg! , 2006). In addition to CRED, a comprehensive database of
global natural catastrophe losses is provided by the Munich Re
NatCatSERVICE, where nearly 800 events are entered in the database
every year; by 2009, the database had more than 25,000 entries with
losses spanning from the 1980s, although records for major events go
up to 2000 years ago (Schmidt et al., 2009; Zschocke and de Leon,
2010). Because of its strong focus on insured losses, the Munich Re
database tends to have less coverage for areas with lower insurance
coverage. At a regional level, the DesInventar database in Latin America
is an example of a regional database that was developed in 1994 by
the Network for Social Studies in Disaster Prevention. The DesInventar
database is an inventory of small-, medium-, and greater-impact disasters

numerous maintenance constraints particularly in remote areas

"ICT capabilities in disaster risk reduction also lie in enhancing interaction
among individuals and institutions from the national, to regional, to
international level, for example, through e-mail, newsgroups, online
chats, mailing lists, and web forums (Marincioni, 2007). Attempts have
been made, for example, in Japan, to create an integrated disaster risk
reduction system where mobile phone communication operates as part
of a greater information generation and delivery chain that includes
Earth observation data analysis, navigation and web technologies, GIS,
and advanced information technology such as grid (Louhisuo et al.,
2007). When such innovations are transferred to other regions they
contribute to international DRR efforts.

becoming a single entry point to the full range of global disaster risk
reduction information and providing a common platform for institutions
to connect, exchange experiences, and share information on DRR, and
facilitating integration with CCA and the development process. Updated
daily, the PreventionWeb platform contains news, DRR initiatives, event

disaster and hazard risk knowledge as opposed to its role in increased flow
of information, with knowledge here defined simply as understanding of
information while information refers to organized data (Zhang et al.,

circulation of disaster information, this does not always result in
increased assimilation of new risk reduction approaches, a factor that is
partly attributed to lack of effective sharing although lack of capacity to
use/apply the information could be a major factor (Zhang et al., 2002;
UNISDR, 2005b).The level of assimilation of ICT technology into disaster
risk reduction depends, among other things, on levels of literacy and
the working environment including institutional arrangements, hence
effectiveness may vary with levels of development (Samarajiva, 2005;

but has ceased to operate; the UN Adaptation Learning Mechanism
(www.adaptationlearning.net) with links to related online resources
and documentation of over 140 countries; Linking Climate Adaptation
Network/CBA-X (www.linkingclimateadaptation.org) which has some DRR

current thinking on climate adaptation and resources and publications
for researchers, practitioners, and policy formers; and the WeAdapt/
WikiAdapt, an adaptation focus portal (www.weadapt.org) that goes
beyond networking and dissemination to cover knowledge integration
and other innovative adaptation tools. These portals are relatively new,
remain predominantly used by their respective communities, and have
also been noted by others to be poorly organized (Mitchell and van
Aalst, 2008). Performance of such ICT information resources in disaster
risk management could improve with more coordination and integration
of CCA, DRR, and the development community.

"Other initiatives include NetHope International, which combines
development and disaster issues into its ICT-centric mandate (Saab et al.,
2008). RANET (www.oar.noaa.gov/spotlite/archive/spot_ranet.html),
originally developed in Africa for drought and which spread to Asia,
Pacific, Central America, and the Caribbean, has a strong community
engagement and disseminates comprehensive information from global
climate data banks combined with regional and local data and forecasts
resulting in spinoffs to food security, agriculture, and health in rural areas
(Boulahya et al., 2005). A network of extension agents, development
practitioners, and trained members of the community are used in
RANET to translate information into local contexts and languages and
as a result, RANET is being considered for other educational initiatives
such as the Spare Time University to improve access to learning in DRR
with benefits for CCA (Glantz, 2007). RANET has been found to reduce
vulnerability to climate extremes in different areas in Africa, for example,
communication of rainfall forecasts in parts of west Africa assists farmers
with decisions on what crop variety to plant and field to use where a
choice of fields of different soil type existed, and also where to search
for pasture and water for livestock during drought periods. However,
RANET faces challenges of unavailability of technical support, follow-up
training, power supply, and coordination (Boulahya et al., 2005).

the extent that the literature allows. One frequently made assumption
is that the DRR world has much to learn from CCA and vice versa (IPCC,
2009). It is widely proposed in the literature that disaster risk reduction
and climate change adaptation should be ‘integrated’ (Birkmann and von

"The call for integration of disaster risk reduction with climate change
adaptation goes much further, however (UNISDR, 2009a). It is argued
that both disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation remain
outside the mainstream of development activities (UNISDR, 2009a). The
United Nations Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction
calls for “an urgent paradigm shift” in disaster risk reduction to address
the underlying risk drivers such as vulnerable rural livelihoods, poor
urban governance, and declining ecosystems (UNISDR, 2009a). The
report also calls for the harmonization of existing institutional and
governance arrangements for disaster risk reduction and climate
change adaptation (p. 181), and presents a 20-point plan to reduce risk
(pp. 176-177).

"limitation of relying heavily on ICT is that there is still a large part of the
world where the ICT infrastructure is not adequately developed. There is
also high agreement in the literature that an increase in the exchange
of data and information at the international level on its own is not a
complete solution to risk reduction. Resources to generate and supply
information and experience in a usable form for each unique case so as
to translate this to knowledge and action are a critical dimension in risk
reduction (high confidence). Further, more attention is required for the
international community to identify what information is essential for
different stages of climate change risk management, and how it should
be captured and used by different actors under different risk reduction
scenarios. Data gathering, information, and knowledge acquisition and
management for disaster relief has a longer history. The process of
building integrated information resource tools that brings together
experiences from CCA, DRR, and the development community is still
weak, yet these tools hold the promise for reducing vulnerability to
disasters in the future (high confidence).

"Communication gaps between professional groups often result from
different language styles and jargons. Heltberg et al. (2008) have
suggested a need for establishing universally shared basic operational
definitions of key terms such as risk, vulnerability, and adaptation
across the different actors as a basis for dissemination of knowledge.
This has also been noted by others, for example, for better coordination
among numerous humanitarian organizations (Saab et al., 2008) and in
the FAO guide for disaster risk management (Baas et al., 2008; also see
Chapter 1). The move toward establishment of national disaster risk
reduction institutions that link to similar regional and international
structures by, for example, UNISDR, provides a framework for bringing
different stakeholders together including the climate change and
development communities at the national level, culminating in greater
integration of risk management at the international level. Other efforts
include international initiatives to integrate, at the national level, disaster
risk reduction with poverty reduction frameworks (Schipper and Pelling,
2006).
"	Text
"A major constraint in climate change risk management results from the
fact that communities working in disaster management, climate change,
and development operate separately and this increases vulnerability to
climate extremes leading to disasters (Schipper and Pelling, 2006;
Lemos et al., 2007). For example, emphasis on humanitarian assistance
has been attributed to development agendas that do not adequately
integrate risk reduction leading to increased vulnerability (Benson and
Twigg, 2007), while development community members are, for example,
better equipped with the use of insurance but fail to link this to climate
risk reduction thus exposing communities to vulnerability to climate
extremes. Similar observations have been made about cities where
urban developers have no link with the climate risk management
community (Wamsler, 2006). But in fact both the development and climate
adaptation communities are concerned with vulnerability to disasters.
This could be a common point of focus facilitating collaboration in
research, information sharing, and practice as part of global security
(Schipper and Pelling, 2006; Lemos et al., 2007).

been suggested that climate change adaptation is a case of ‘reinventing
the wheel’ (Mercer 2010) since disaster risk reduction covers much of the
same ground and is “already well-established within the international
development community” (Lewis, 1999; Wisner et al., 2004).

about such forms of integration (see Chapters 5 and 6). There are
numerous hazards and disasters that are not directly linked to climate

to integration and it is by no means agreed that full integration
between disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation is
possible, or desirable.

"The literature reflects a view that DRR and CCA operate at different
spatial scales (Birkmann and von Teichman, 2010) and that therefore their
integration in practice has been problematic or impracticable. Disasters
are often thought of as events occurring at a specific location whereas
climate change is thought of as a global or regional phenomenon. This
view is now being modified as the need for locally based climate
change adaptation becomes evident (Adger et al., 2005), as the impacts
of local disasters are recognized as having more widespread impacts at
a larger spatial scale (see Chapters 4 and 6 and Section 7.2.1).

"There is also a ‘top-down’ versus ‘bottom-up’ distinction (Rayner, 2010).
Natural hazards and associated disasters have a long history, and DRR
has moved slowly from local to national to international levels in
response to the rationale described in Section 7.2. Climate change, on
the other hand, came to attention as a result of the work of atmospheric
scientists and was first recognized primarily as a global problem, and
has subsequently moved down scale as the need for CCA became
more apparent and pressing. This shows that the opportunity exists
for the two to complement each other, at the international level where
DRR has progressed, and at the national and local level to which CCA
is moving.

"There is also a perceived difference in the temporal scales of CCA
and DRR. The disaster community has traditionally been focused on
humanitarian response including relief and reconstruction in the relatively
short term. (UNISDR, 2009b), whereas climate change has been
recognized as including long-term processes with projections extending
from decades to centuries (Chapter 3), which poses problems for
development communities usually focusing on a shorter time span.
More effective cooperation and integration between the DRR and the
CCA practitioners could help to detect, address, and overcome these
temporal-scale challenges. This essentially requires the stronger
recognition of the risks of climate-related disasters in CCA and the
incorporation of longer-term climate change risk factors into DRR.
"	Text
"The mandate of this Special Report is in part to consider how CCA could
be enhanced by learning from the experience of the DRR community,
and vice versa. The literature shows a widespread view that the two
could both benefit from closer integration with each other and that
both would benefit society better if there was more integration into
sustainable development (UNISDR, 2009a). Integration in this sense is
meant as symbiosis or synthesis rather than formal integration at the
institutional level. Integration across scales can be facilitated if
integration between DRR and CCA were also to take place at local,
national, and international levels. Integration at the international level
might help to facilitate integration at national and local levels although
the opposite is also possible. This Special Report is itself a prime example
of emerging cooperation. It is in line with a wider evolution in the global
environmental change science research community whose products
serve both disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation at the
international level of management.

"local to national to international. At the international level there are
weak links between the climate adaptation ‘regime’ as expressed in the
UNFCCC and the leading DRR ‘regime’ in the form of the UNISDR. The
character of the two ‘regimes’ is radically different, the former having
the task of implementing an international agreement and the latter
being a UN-wide interagency and advocacy program. The history of the
evolution of the two institutional arrangements is markedly different.
The disaster field has long been dominated by humanitarian and
emergency response measures and has only relatively recently been
moving toward a stronger DRR approach (Burton, 2003). Similarly,
climate change was initially conceived as an atmospheric pollution
issue with greater emphasis on the need to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions and has slowly been repositioned, as in the UNFCCC
negotiations, as also being a development issue. One consequence of
the different evolution has been that the emerging international climate
‘regime’ (UNFCCC) is linked at the national level to environment
ministries, whereas the disaster ‘regime’ (UNISDR) is linked to emergency
planning and preparedness agencies or, in other cases, to the office of
President. Neither DRR nor CAA are well linked to economic planning
and development agencies (UNISDR, 2009b).

vulnerability from other hazards, both in the present and future. Building adaptation into multi-hazard risk management
involves consideration of current climate variability and projected changes in climate extremes, which pose different
challenges to affected human and natural systems than changes in the means. Where changes in extremes cause
greater stresses on human and natural systems, direct impacts may be more unpredictable, increasing associated
adaptation challenges.

"Actions that range from incremental steps to transformational changes are essential for reducing risk from
weather and climate extremes (high agreement, robust evidence). [8.6, 8.7] Incremental steps aim to improve
efficiency within existing technological, governance, and value systems, whereas transformation may involve alterations
of fundamental attributes of those systems. The balance between incremental and transformational approaches
depends on evolving risk profiles and underlying social and ecological conditions. Disaster risk, climate change
impacts, and capacity to cope and adapt are unevenly distributed. Vulnerability is often concentrated in poorer countries
or groups, although the wealthy can also be vulnerable to extreme events. Where vulnerability is high and adaptive
capacity relatively low, changes in extreme climate and weather events can make it difficult for systems to adapt
sustainably without transformational changes. Such transformations, where they are required, are facilitated through
increased emphasis on adaptive management, learning, innovation, and leadership.

capacities and resources and multiple interacting processes. Actions are framed by tradeoffs between competing
prioritized values and objectives, and different visions of development that can change over time. Iterative, reflexive
approaches allow development pathways to integrate risk management so that diverse policy solutions can be

disaster risk management and adaptation to climate change thus can be difficult to reconcile. Such reconciliation
involves overcoming the disconnect between local risk management practices and national institutional and legal
frameworks, policy, and planning. Resilience thinking offers some tools for reconciling short- and long-term responses,
including integrating different types of knowledge, an emphasis on inclusive governance, and principles of adaptive
management. However, limits to resilience are faced when thresholds or tipping points associated with social and/or

exposure and vulnerability associated with development contexts. For
example, there is robust evidence that institutional arrangements and
governance weaknesses can transform extreme events into disasters
(Hewitt, 1997; Pelling, 2003; Wisner et al., 2004; Ahrens and Rudolph,
2006). The potential for concatenated global impacts of extreme events
continues to grow as the world's economy becomes more interconnected,
but in relative terms most impacts will occur in contexts with severe
environmental, economic, technological, cultural, and cognitive limits to
adaptation (see Section 5.5.3). In relation to extreme events, global risk
assessments show that social losses — as well as economic losses as a

"This chapter focuses on the implications of changing climate extremes
for development, and considers how disaster risk management and
climate change adaptation together can contribute to a sustainable and
resilient future. Changes in the frequency, timing, magnitude, and
characteristics of extreme events pose challenges to the goals of reducing
disaster risk and vulnerability, both in the present and in the future (see
Chapter 3). Enhancing the capacity of social-ecological systems to cope
with, adapt to, and shape change is central to building sustainable and
resilient development pathways in the face of climate change. The
concept for social-ecological systems recognizes the interdependence of
social and ecological factors in the generation and management of risk,
as well as in the pursuit of sustainable development. Despite 20 years
on the policy agenda, sustainable development remains contested and
elusive (Hopwood et al., 2005). However, within the context of climate
change, it is becoming increasingly clear that the sustainability of humans
on the Earth is closely linked to resilient social-ecological systems, which
is influenced by social institutions, human agency, and human capabilities
(Pelling, 2003; Bohle et al., 2009; Adger et al., 2011).
"	Text
"This chapter recognizes that outcomes of changing extreme events depend
on responses and approaches to disaster risk reduction and climate
change adaptation, both of which are closely linked to development
processes. The assessment of literature presented in this chapter shows
that changes in extreme events call for greater alignment and integration
of climate change responses and sustainable development strategies,
and that this alignment depends on greater coherence between short-
and long-term objectives. Yet there are different interpretations of
development, different preferences and prioritized values and motivations,
different visions for the future, and many tradeoffs involved. Research
on the resilience of social-ecological systems provides some lessons for
addressing the gaps among these objectives. Transformative social,
economic, and environmental responses can facilitate disaster risk
reduction and adaptation (see Box 8-1). Transformations often include
questioning of social values, institutions, and technical practices (Loorbach
et al., 2008; Hedrén and Linnér, 2009; Pelling 2010a). A resilient and
sustainable future is a choice that involves proactive measures that
promote transformations, including adaptive management, learning,
innovation, and leadership capacity to manage risks and uncertainty.
"	Text
"Transformation involves fundamental changes in the attributes of a system, including value systems; regulatory, legislative, or bureaucratic
regimes; financial institutions; and technological or biophysical systems (see Glossary). This chapter focuses on the transformation of
disaster risk management systems in the context of climate extremes, through integration with climate change adaptation strategies and
wider systems of human development. This is similar to, yet distinct from, other types of transformation associated with climate change.
For example, there have been attempts to understand climate change and development failures by identifying the scope for political
(Harvey, 2010), social (Kovats et al., 2005), economic (Jackson, 2009), and value (Leiserowitz et al., 2006) transformation, and so too for
disaster risk management (Klein, 2007). Across these cases, observed processes of stasis and change are analogous (often using common
language), but actors and objectives are distinct. That said, transformation in wider political, economic, social, and ethical systems can
open or close policy space for a more resilient and sustainable form of disaster risk management (Birkland, 2006), just as acts aimed at
transformation in managing climate extremes can have implications for wider systems. This is particularly true where contemporary
development goals, paths, and hierarchies are identified and addressed as part of the root or proximate causes of vulnerability and risk,
that is, when they are seen as part of the solution for building resilient and sustainable futures (Wisner, 2003; Pelling, 2010a). Although
there has been some research on how and why social lock-in makes it difficult to move away from established development priorities
and trajectories (Pelling and Manuel-Navarrete, 2011), there has been only limited academic work to date on the ways in which wider
transformations impact on disaster risk management, and vice versa.

resilience as a moving target that is positioned somewhere between the
acceptability of residual risk and the costs of risk management. The target
moves as the relationship between risk and uncertainty changes (driven
by climate extremes, as well as development trends such as urbanization)
in relation to the capacity for risk management (which integrates climate
change adaptation, disaster risk management, and development). As
risk and uncertainty increase, incremental adjustments in practices may
no longer be sufficient to achieve resilience, and at some point the
growing resilience gap will provoke a search for transformative solutions.
Through enhanced experimentation and learning approaches, climate

use of analysis and modeling tools to improve disaster risk management
and adaptation (Section 8.6.2.1), the implementation of new institutional
tools (Section 8.6.2.2), and transformational strategies to reach multiple
objectives (Section 8.6.2.3). Such transformational changes can be
facilitated using a combination of approaches (Section 8.6.3), including
adaptive management (Section 8.6.3.1), learning (Section 8.6.3.2),

"Adaptive capacity underlies action and is defined in this report as the
combination of strengths, attributes, and resources available to an
individual, community, society, or organization that can be used to
prepare for and undertake adaptation. Adaptive capacity can also be
described as the capability for innovation and anticipation (Armitage,
2005), the ability to learn from mistakes (Adger, 2003), and the capacity
to generate experience in dealing with change (Berkes et al., 2003).
Enhancing adaptive capacity under climate change entails paying
attention to learning about past, present, and future climate threats,
accumulated memory of adaptive strategies, and anticipatory action to
prepare for surprises and discontinuities in the climate system (Nelson
et al., 2007).

"Current adaptation planning in many countries, regions, and localities
involves identification of a wide range of options, although the available
knowledge of their costs, benefits, wider consequences, potentials, and
limitations is still incomplete (NRC, 2010; see Section 4.5). In many cases,
the most attractive adaptation actions are those that offer development
benefits in the relatively near term, as well as reductions of vulnerabilities
in the longer term (Agrawala, 2005; Klein et al., 2007; McGray et al., 2007;
Hallegatte, 2008a; NRC, 2010). This is a lesson already noted, though not
always practiced, in disaster preparedness and risk reduction (IFRC,
2002; Pelling, 2010b). An emerging literature discusses adaptation
through the lens of sustainability, recognizing that not all adaptation
responses are necessarily benign; there are tradeoffs, potentials for
negative outcomes, competing interests, different types of knowledge,

"Disaster risk management is increasingly considered as one of the
‘frontlines’ of adaptation, and perhaps one of the most promising
arenas for mainstreaming or integrating climate change adaptation into
sustainable development planning (Sperling and Szekely, 2005; G. O'Brien
et al., 2006; Schipper and Pelling, 2006; Schipper, 2009). However, it
requires modifying development policies, mechanisms, and tools, and
identifying and responding to those who gain and lose from living with
and creating risk. Contested notions of development and hence differing
perspectives on sustainable development planning lead to different
conclusions about how disaster risk reduction can contribute to adaptation.
This section reviews the definitions of some of the key concepts used in

"Adaptive capacity is uneven across and within sectors, regions, and
countries (K. O’Brien et al, 2006). Although wealthy countries and
regions have more resources to direct to adaptation, the availability of
financial resources is only one factor determining adaptive capacity (Moss
et al, 2010; Ford and Ford, 2011). Other factors include the ability to
recognize the importance of the problem in the context of multiple
stresses, to identify vulnerable sectors and communities, to translate
scientific knowledge into action, and to implement projects and programs
(Moser and Ekstrom, 2010). The capacity to adapt is in fact dynamic
and influenced by economic and natural resources, social networks,
entitlements, institutions and governance, human resources, and
technology (Parry et al., 2007). It is particularly important to understand
that places with greater wealth are not necessarily less vulnerable to
climate impacts and that a socioeconomic system might be as vulnerable
as its weakest link (K. O’Brien et al., 2006; Tol and Yohe, 2007). Therefore,
even wealthy locations can be severely impacted by extreme events,
socially as well as economically, as Europeans experienced during the
2003 heat wave (Salagnac, 2007; see also Case Study 9.2.1).

that addresses the underlying causes of vulnerability and poverty,
including ecological fragility; it is considered a way of generating social
transformation, or changes in the fundamental attributes of society that
contribute to vulnerability (Eriksen and O'Brien, 2007; Eriksen and Brown,

"Climate change can magnify many preexisting risks through changes in
the frequency, severity, and spatial distribution of weather-related
hazards, as well as through increases in vulnerability due to climate
impacts (e.g., decreased water availability, decreased agricultural
production and food availability, or increased heat stress) (see Section
4.3). Like adaptation, disaster risk reduction may be anticipatory
(ensuring that new development does not increase risk) or corrective
(reducing existing risk levels) (Lavell, 2009). Given expected population
increases in hazard-prone areas, anticipatory disaster risk reduction is
fundamental to addressing the risk associated with future climate
extremes. At the same time, investments in corrective disaster risk
reduction are required to address the accumulation of exposure and
susceptibility to existing climate risks, for example, those inherited from
past urban planning or rural infrastructure decisions.

"Discussions of the relationships between sustainable development and
climate change have increased over the past decades (Cohen et al., 1998;
Yohe et al., 2007; Bizikova et al., 2010). The literature on development
has considered how development paths relate to vulnerabilities both to
climate change and to climate change policies (e.g., Davis, 2001; Garg
et al., 2009), as well as to other hazards. Clearly, some climate change-
related environmental shifts are potentially threatening to sustainable
development, but they can also help move toward sustainability,
especially if the trends or events are severe enough to require significant
adjustment of unsustainable development practices or development
paths (e.g., the relocation of population or economic activities to less
vulnerable areas). In such cases, both disaster risk reduction and climate
change adaptation can be important — even essential — contributors to
sustainable development.

"Disaster risk can be defined in many ways (see Section 1.1.2). In general,
however, it is closely associated with the concepts of hazards, exposure,
and vulnerability. Hazards are defined in this report as the potential
occurrence of a natural or human-induced physical event that may
cause negative consequences. Exposure is defined as the presence of
people, livelihoods, environmental services and resources, infrastructure,
and economic, social, and cultural assets in places that could be
adversely affected by climate extremes. Hazards and exposure are
changing, not only as the result of climate change, but also due to
human activities. For example, hazards associated with floods, landslides,
storm surges, and fires can be influenced by declines in ecosystem
services that regulate runoff, erosion, etc. The drainage of wetlands,
deforestation, the destruction of mangroves, and the changes associated
with urban development (such as the impermeability of surfaces and
overexploitation of groundwater) are all factors that can modify
hazard patterns (Nobre et al., 1991, 2005; MEA, 2005; Nicholls et
al., 2008). Consequently, most weather-related hazards now have an
anthropogenic element (Cardona, 1999; Lavell, 1999).

"Climate change adaptation and disaster risk management (especially
disaster risk reduction) are critical elements of long-term sustainability
for economies, societies, and environments at all scales (Wilbanks and
Kates, 2010). The generally accepted and most widespread definition of
sustainable development comes from the Brundtland Commission
Report, which defined sustainable development as “development that
meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of
future generations to meet their own needs” (WCED, 1987). A number
of principles of sustainable development have emerged, including the
achievement of a standard of human well-being that meets human
needs and provides opportunities for social and economic development;
that sustains the life support systems of the planet; that broadens
participation in development processes and decisions; and that accelerates
the movement of knowledge into action in order to provide a wider
range of options for resolving issues (WCED, 1987; Meadowcroft, 1997;
NRC, 1999; Swart et al., 2003; MEA, 2005). Because sustainable
development means finding pathways that achieve socioeconomic and
environmental goals without sacrificing either, it is a concept that is
fundamentally political (Wilbanks, 1994).

"Vulnerability has many different (and often conflicting) definitions and
interpretations, both across and within the disaster risk and climate
communities (see Sections 1.1.2 and 2.2). Vulnerability can increase or
decrease over time as a result of both environmental and socioeconomic
changes (Blaikie et al, 1994; Leichenko and O’Brien, 2008). In general,
improvements in a country’s development indicators have been associated
with reduced mortality risk, yet an increase in economic loss and insurance
claims (UNDP, 2004; Pielke Jr. et al., 2008; Schumacher and Strobl, 2008;
ECA, 2009; UNISDR, 2009; World Bank, 2010a). Indeed, recent evidence
confirms that, despite increasing exposure, mortality risk from tropical
cyclones and floods is now decreasing globally, as well as in heavily
exposed regions like Asia (UNISDR, 2011). In contrast, the risk of
economic loss is increasing globally because reductions in vulnerability
are not compensating for rapid increases in the exposure of economic
assets. In the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) countries, for example, economic losses are increasing at a faster
rate than GDP per capita. In other words, the risk of losing wealth in
disasters is increasing faster than that wealth is being created (UNISDR,
2011). However, some types of development may increase vulnerability
or transfer it between social groups, particularly if development is
unequal or degrades ecosystem services (Guojie, 2003). Even where
growth is more equitable, vulnerabilities can be generated (e.g., when
modern buildings are not constructed to prescribed safety standards)
(Hewitt, 1997; Satterthwaite, 2007).

"Ecosystems can act as natural barriers against climate-related hazardous
extremes, reducing disaster risk (Conde, 2001; Scholze et al., 2005). For
example, mangrove forests are a highly effective natural flood control
mechanism that will become increasingly important with sea level rise,
and are already used as a coastal defense against extreme climatic and
non-climatic events (Adger et al., 2005). The benefits of such ecosystem
services are determined by ecosystem health, hazard characteristics,
local geomorphology, and the geography and location of the system
with respect to the hazard (Lacambra and Zahedi, 2011). In assessing
the ecological limits of adaptation to climate change, Peterson (2009)
emphasizes that ecosystem regime shifts can occur as the result of
extreme climate shocks, but that such shifts depend upon the resilience
of the ecosystem, and are influenced by processes operating at multiple
scales. In particular, there is evidence that the loss of regulating services
(eg., flood regulation, regulation of soil erosion) erodes ecological
resilience (MEA, 2005).

"environmental stresses from and responses to climate change is still
limited (Fankhauser et al., 1999; Adger et al., 2007; Repetto, 2008). In
terms of disaster risk reduction, a large number of lives have been saved
over the last decade due to improved disaster early warning systems
(IFRC, 2005), and to increased development and human welfare
(UNISDR, 2011). There remains, however, much more that can be done
to reduce mortality and counteract growth in the number of people
affected by disasters and climate extremes. For example, recent self-
assessments of progress by over 100 countries on the objectives of the
Hyogo Framework of Action (UNISDR, 2009, 2011) indicate that few
developing countries have conducted comprehensive, accurate, and
accessible risk assessments, which are a prerequisite for both
anticipatory and corrective disaster risk reduction. Furthermore, the
assessment shows that few countries are able to quantify their investment
in disaster risk reduction. There are numerous ways to evaluate success of
disaster risk management or climate adaptation, including gauging the
extent to which the goals of a given action (determined in anticipation
of a given environmental stressor) are achieved, independent of whether
the environmental stressor materializes. Both climate adaptation and
disaster risk management can contribute to responses to changes in
extreme events due to climate change, yet neither approach alone is
sufficient.

"Reducing human pressures on ecosystems and managing natural
resources more sustainably can facilitate efforts to mitigate climate
change and to reduce vulnerabilities to extreme climate and weather
events. The degradation of ecosystems is undermining their capacity to
provide ecosystem goods and services upon which human livelihoods and
societies depend (MEA, 2005; WWF, 2010), and to withstand disturbances,
including climate change. There is evidence that the likelihood of collapse
and subsequent regime shifts in ecological and coupled social-ecological
systems may be increasing in response to the magnitude, frequency,
and duration of climate change and other disturbance events (Folke et al.,
2004; MEA, 2005; Woodward, 2010). Large, persistent shifts in ecosystem
services not only affect the total level of welfare that people in a
community can enjoy, they also impact the welfare distribution between
people within and between generations and hence may give rise to new
conflicts over resource use and questions on inter-generational equity as
a component of sustainable development (Thomas and Twyman, 2005).
They could result in domino effects of increased pressure on successive
resource systems, as has been suggested in the case of depletion of
successive fish stocks (Berkes et al., 2006). However, the thresholds at
which ecosystems undergo regime shifts and the points at which these
may catalyze social stress remain largely unknown, partly due to
variability over space and time (Biggs et al., 2009; Scheffer, 2009).

"Econometric analyses at the national scale nave reached altterent
conclusions about the impact of disasters on economic growth, but the
balance of evidence suggests a negative impact. Whereas Noy and
Nualsri (2007), Noy (2009), Hochrainer (2009), Jaramillo (2009), and
Raddatz (2007) suggest that the overall impact on growth is negative,
Albala-Bertrand (1993) and Skidmore and Toya (2002) argue that natural
disasters have a positive influence on long-term economic growth, often
due to both the stimulus effect of reconstruction and the productivity
effect. As suggested by Cavallo and Noy (2009) and Loayza et al. (2009),
this difference may arise from the different impacts of small and large
disasters, the latter having a negative impact on growth and the former
enhancing growth. In any case, whether or not disaster losses translate
into other social and economic impacts depends on how each individual
disaster is managed (Moreno and Cardona, 2011) which in turn is related
to capacities and political priorities. At the local scale, Strobl (2011)
investigates the impact of hurricane landfall on county-level economic
growth in the United States. This analysis shows that a county that is
struck by at least one hurricane in a year sees its economic growth
reduced on average by 0.79%, and increased by only 0.22% the following
year. Noy and Vu (2010) investigate the impact of disasters on economic
growth at the province level in Vietnam, and find that lethal disasters
decrease economic production while costly disasters increase short-
term growth. Rodriguez-Oreggia et al. (2009) focus instead on poverty
and the World Bank's Human Development Index at the municipality
level in Mexico. They show that municipalities affected by disasters
experienced an increase in poverty by 1.5 to 3.6%. Considering these
important links between disasters and development, there is a need
to consider disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation, and
sustainable development in a consistent and integrated framework (G.
O'Brien et al., 2006; Schipper and Pelling, 2006).

measurable impacts such as loss of lives, damage to infrastructure, or
economic costs. They can lead to a loss of what matters to individuals,

such as sense of place or of community, identity, or culture. This has long
been observed within the disaster risk community (Hewitt, 1997; Mustafa,
2005) and in more recent work in the climate change community (O'Brien,
2009; Adger et al, 2010; Pelling, 2010a). A values-based approach
recognizes that socioeconomic systems are continually evolving, driven
by innovations, aspirations, and changing values and preferences of the
constituents (Simmie and Martin, 2010; Hedlund-de Witt, 2011). This
approach raises not only the ethical question of ‘whose values count?’,
but also the important political question of ‘who decides?’. These

change extremes, and they can have significant implications for
sustainable development. The disaster risk community has used several
points of view for resolving decisions about where to invest limited
resources, including considerations of economic rationality and moral
obligation (Sen, 2000). Value judgments are embedded in problem
framing, solutions, development decisions, and evaluation of outcomes,
thus it is important to make them explicit and visible. Values describe
what is desirable or preferable, and they can be used to represent the
subjective, intangible dimensions of the material and nonmaterial world
(O'Brien and Wolf, 2010). They are closely linked to worldviews and
beliefs, including perceptions of change and causality (Rohan, 2000;
Leiserowitz, 2006; Weber, 2010). Values both inform and are shaped by
action, judgment, choice, attitude, evaluation, argument, exhortation,
rationalization, and attribution of causality (Rokeach, 1979). However,
values do not always clearly translate to particular behaviors
(Leiserowitz et al., 2005). Recognizing and reconciling conflicting values

access to and distribution of relief and reconstruction aid (Sphere,
2004). The ethics and equity dimensions of risk management have also
been explored in adaptation through the application of Rawls’ theory of
justice (Rawls, 1971; Paavola, 2005; Paavola and Adger 2006; Paavola

maximizing this social welfare function reveals where economic benefits
of public investments exceed costs. The calculated economic benefits of
investing in risk reduction vary, but are often considered significant (see
Ghesquiere et al., 2006; World Bank 2010a; UNISDR, 2011). There are,
however, extreme difficulties in accounting for the complexity of disaster

levels of stress (UNFCCC, 2006; Larsen et al., 2007; CCSP, 2008). Another
focus is on technologies that assist with information collection and

disseminate information about possible threats and contingencies —
although access to such technologies may be limited in some developing

nearly every case, issues are raised about the balance between risk

technologies, roads and infrastructure, food and production technologies,
energy systems, and so on. Technology choices can alleviate disaster
risk, but they can also significantly increase risks and add to adaptation
challenges (Jonkman et al., 2010). For example, some modern energy
systems and centralized communication systems are dependent on
physical structures that can be vulnerable to storm damage. It has been
suggested that relatively centralized high-technology systems are ‘brittle,’
offering efficiencies under normal conditions but subject to cascading

"Technology is an essential part of responses to climate extremes, at least partly because technology choices and uses are so often a part
of the problem. Enhancing early warning systems is one example where technology can play an important role in disaster risk management.
This example also flags the importance of considering ‘hard’ (engineering) and ‘soft’ (social and administrative) technology. Great
advances have been made in hard technology around hazard identification, and this has saved many lives. Communicating warnings
through the ‘soft’ technology of institutional reform and communication networks has been less well developed. Both hard and soft
technology systems must be responsive to different cultures, environments, and types of governance. Most fundamentally, it is clear that
technologies are the product of research and development choices, which reflect particular values, interests, and priorities. The successful
transfer of technology is sensitive to local needs, capacities, and development goals. Technologies can have unintended consequences
that contribute to maladaptations. For example, some modern agricultural technologies may reduce local biodiversity and constrain
future adaptation. Technologies only matter if they are both appropriate and accessible. Technology development and use are necessary
for reducing vulnerabilities to climate extremes, both through mitigation and adaptation, but they need to be the right technologies that
are deployed in the right ways. This calls for greater reflection on the social, economic, and environmental consequences of technology
across both space and time. In many cases, responses to climate extremes can be improved by addressing social vulnerability, rather
than focusing exclusively on technological responses.

"There is no single or optimal way of adapting to climate change or
managing risks, because contexts for risk management vary so widely.
For example, risk management decisions can be oriented toward
incremental responses to frequent events that are disruptive but
perhaps not ‘extreme.’ Often, tradeoffs between multiple objectives are
ambiguous. For example, focusing on and taking actions to protect
against frequent events may lead to greater vulnerability to larger and
rarer extreme events (Burby, 2006). This is a particular challenge for
investing in fixed physical infrastructure. Social investments and risk
awareness, including early warning systems, can be strengthened by
more frequent low-impact events that maintain risk visibility and allow
preparedness for larger, less frequent events (see Case Studies 9.2.11
and 9.2.14). Pielke Jr. et al. (2007) also warn that locating adaptation
policy in a narrow risk framework by concentrating only on identifiable
anthropogenic risks can distort public policy because vulnerabilities are
created through multiple stresses.

"One climate change/development tradeoff linked both to timeframes
and the magnitude of climate extremes is the future need for risk
reduction infrastructure that would require changes in ecologically or
historically important areas. For example, when considering additional
protection (e.g., dikes and seawalls) in historical centers, aesthetic and
cultural elements as well as building costs will be taken into account.
Existing planning and design standards to protect cultural heritage or
ecological integrity may need to be balanced with the needs of adaptation
(Hallegatte et al., 2011). Difficulties in attributing value to cultural and
ecological assets mean that CBAs are not the best tool to approach
these types of problems. Multi-criteria decisionmaking tools (Birkmann,
2006) that incorporate a participatory element and can recognize the
political, ethical, and philosophical aspects of such decisions can also be
useful (Mercer et al, 2008). But the magnitude of emerging climate
extremes is an important issue. If climate change is relatively severe,
rather than moderate, then the focus on preserving iconic areas is likely
to increase, as will the costs.
"	Text
"Another contextual complication that introduces tradeoffs is the fact
that impacts of climate change extremes extend across multiple scales.
The challenge is to find ways to combine the strengths of addressing
multiple scales, rather than having them work against each other
(Wilbanks, 2007, 2009). Local scales offer potentials for bottom-up
actions that ensure participation, flexibility, and innovation. At the same
time, efforts to develop initiatives from the bottom up are often limited
by a lack of information, limited resources, and limited awareness of
larger-scale driving forces (AAG, 2003). Larger scales offer potentials for
top-down actions that assure resource mobilization and cost sharing.
Integrating these kinds of assets across scales is often essential for
resilience to extremes, but in fact, integration is profoundly impeded by
differences in who decides, who pays, and who benefits, and perceptions
of scalar effects that often reflect striking ignorance and misunderstanding
(Wilbanks, 2007). In recent years, there have been a number of calls for
innovative co-management structures that cross scales in order to
promote sustainable development (e.g., Bressers and Rosenbaum, 2003;
Cash et al., 2006; Campbell et al., 2010).

"As one salient example, during disaster reconstruction, tensions frequently
arise between demands for speed of delivery and sustainability of outcome.
Response and reconstruction funds tend to be time-limited, often requiring
expenditure within 12 months or less from the time of disbursement.
This pressure is compounded by multiple agencies working with often
limited coordination. Time pressure and competition between agencies
tends to promote centralized decisionmaking and the subcontracting of
purchasing and project management to non-local commercial actors.
Both outcomes save time but miss opportunities to include local people
in decisionmaking and learning from the event, with the resulting
reconstruction in danger of failing to support local cultural and economic
priorities (Berke et al., 1993; Pearce, 2003). At the same time it is important
not to romanticize local actors or their viewpoints, which might at times
be unsustainable or point to maladaptation, or to accept local voices
as representative of all local actors. When successful, participatory
reconstruction planning has been shown to build local capacity and
leadership, bind communities, and provide mechanisms for information
exchange with scientific and external actors (Lyons et al., 2010). As part
of any participatory or community-based reconstruction, the importance
of a clear conflict resolution strategy has been recognized.

objectives through broader participation in strategy development and

capacity and disaster risk management. Policies and actions to achieve
multiple objectives include stakeholder participation, participatory
governance (IRGC, 2009), capacity building, and adaptive organizations,
including both private and public institutions where there is a considerable

policy choices, both coping and adaptation denote forms of conduct
that aim and indeed may achieve modifications in the ways in which
society relates to nature, and nature to society (Stehr and von Storch,
2005). As discussed in Section 2.4, coping actions are those that take
place when trying to alleviate the impacts or to live with the costs of a
specific event. They are usually found during the unfolding of disaster
impacts, which can continue for some time after an event — for example,
if somebody loses their job or is traumatized. Coping strategies can help
to alleviate the immediate impact of a hazard, but may also increase
vulnerabilities over the medium to longer term (Swift, 1989; Davies,
1993; Sperling et al., 2008). The different time frames for coping and
adaptation can present challenges for risk management. Focusing on
short-term responses and coping strategies can limit the scope for

increased resilience, capacity building, broad social benefits from

the value of multi-hazard planning (see Sections 5.4 and 6.5). Negative

future generations is not considered; issues related to the economic
discounting of future benefits; ‘silo effects’ of optimizing responses for
one system or sector without considering interaction effects with others
(see Burby et al., 2001); equity issues regarding who benefits and who

"To manage tradeoffs and conflicts in an open, efficient, and transparent
way, institutional and legal arrangements are extremely important. The
existing literature on legislation for adaptation at the state level is not
comprehensive, but those countries studied lack many of the institutional
mechanisms and legal frameworks that are important for coordination
at the state level (Richardson et al., 2009). This has been found to be the
case for Vietnam, Laos, and China (Lin, 2009). In the South Pacific, high
exposure to climate change risk has yet to translate into legislative
frameworks to support adaptation — with only Fiji, Papua New Guinea,
and Western Samoa formulating national climate change regulatory
frameworks (Kwa, 2009). Without a supporting and implemented
national legislative structure, achieving local disaster reduction and
climate change adaptation planning can be complicated (La Trobe and
Davis, 2005; Pelling and Holloway, 2006; see also Section 6.4). Still,
where local leadership is determined, skillful planning is possible, even
without legislation. This has been the experience of Ethekwini

South Africa), which has developed a Municipal Climate Protection
Programme with a strong and early focus on adaptation without national-
level policy or legal frameworks to guide adaptation planning at the

reconstruction, with resources devoted to repairing and replacing rather
than accumulating infrastructure and equipment. This obstacle to capital
accumulation and infrastructure development can lead to a permanent
disaster-related underdevelopment (Hallegatte et al, 2007; Hallegatte

natural disasters have a negative impact on economic growth and
development, especially when direct losses are large. This negative
impact is found to be larger when the disaster affects a smaller country,
with lower GDP per capita, weaker institutions, lower openness to
trade, lower literacy rates, and lower levels of government spending,
and when foreign aid and remittances are lower. Such effects have been
modeled by Hallegatte et al. (2007) and Hallegatte and Dumas (2008)
using a reduced-form economic model that shows that the average GDP
impact of natural disasters can be either close to zero if reconstruction
capacity is large enough, or very large if reconstruction capacity is too
limited, which may be the case in less-developed countries. There are,
however, many uncertainties in the ways in which people’s spontaneous

back to influence long-term adaptive capacity and options. Migration,
which can be traumatic for those involved, might lead to enhanced life

health care, require more immediate attention (Klein et al., 2005; Adly

rural contexts, short-term coping may be a tradeoff that increases
longer-term risks (UNISDR, 2009; Brauch and Oswald Spring, 2011).
Adaptation, on the other hand, is often focused on minimizing potential
risk to future losses (Oliver-Smith, 2007). This ‘long-term’ framing of
adaptation can constrain both short-term coping and adaptive capacity,
for example, when relocation of settlements to avoid coastal hazards
undermines social capital and local livelihoods, limiting household coping
and adaptive capacity (Hunter, 2005). There is a large literature and
much experience related to slum relocation that is of direct relevance to
urban coping and adaptation (Gilbert and Ward, 1984; Davidson et al.,

"Disaster risk management originated from humanitarian assistance

measures, which seek to address the broader environmental and

Within countries, disaster risk management efforts are often coordinated
by civil defense agencies, while measures to adapt to climate change
are usually developed by environment ministries. Responding to climate
change was originally more of a top-down process, where advances in
scientific research led to international policy discussions and frameworks.
While the different institutional structures may represent an initial
coordination challenge, the converging focus on vulnerability reduction
represents an opportunity for managing disaster and climate risks more
comprehensively within the development context (Sperling and Szekely,

underestimate external forces that influence their region while

the low degree of control people feel they have over these drivers,

issue that makes it difficult to reconcile short- and long-term goals
arises from the challenges in projecting the long-term climate and
corresponding risks (see Section 3.2.3). Examples of this challenge are
reflected in the demographic growth of Florida in the 1970s and 1980s,
which unfolded during a period of low hurricane activity but may

framework to understand the interactions between climate change and

Approaches that focus on resilience emphasize the need to manage for
change, to see change as an intrinsic part of any system, social or
otherwise, and to ‘expect the unexpected.’ Resilience thinking goes
beyond the conventional engineering systems’ emphasis on capacity to
control and absorb external shocks in systems assumed to be stable (Folke,
2006). For social-ecological systems (examined as a set of interactions
between people and the ecosystems they depend on), resilience
involves three properties: the amount of change a system can undergo
and retain the same structure and functions; the degree to which it can
reorganize; and the degree to which it can build capacity to learn and
adapt (Folke, 2006). Resilience can also be considered a dynamic
process linked to human agency, as expressed in the ability to deal with
hazards or disturbance, to engage with uncertainty and future changes,
to adapt, cope, learn, and innovate, and to develop leadership capacity
(Bohle et al., 2009; Obrist et al., 2010).

times, adaptation is part of a path-dependent trajectory of change.
Resilience also considers a distinction between incremental adjustments
and system transformation, which may broaden the expanse of adaptation
and also provide space for agency (Nelson et al., 2007). Resilience
approaches can be seen as complementary to agent-based analyses of
climate change responses that emphasize processes of negotiation and
decisionmaking, as they can provide insights into the systems-wide
implications. Adger et al. (2011) show that dealing with specific risks
without taking into account the nature of system resilience can lead to
responses that potentially undermine long-term resilience.

"Sections 1.4 and 2.4). When the poor are impacted by disasters, limited
resources are quickly expended in coping actions that can further
undermine household sustainability in the long run, reducing capital
and increasing hazard exposure or vulnerability. In these vicious cycles
of decline, households tend first to expend savings and then, if pressures
continue, to withdraw members from non-productive activities such as
school, and finally to sell productive assets. As households begin to
collapse, individuals may be forced to migrate or in some cases enter
into culturally inappropriate, dangerous, or illegal livelihoods such as
the sex industry (Mgbako and Smith, 2010; Ferris, 2011). This poverty
and vulnerability trap means that recovery to pre-disaster levels of well-
being becomes increasingly difficult (Burton et al., 1993; Adger, 1996,
Wisner et al., 2004; Chambers, 2006).

"rather than flexibility, that is, maintaining the status quo and thus serving
particular interests rather than supporting adaptive management, social
learning, or inclusive decisionmaking. One challenge to enhancing
resilience of desired system states is to identify how responses to any
single stressor influence the larger, interconnected social-ecological
system, including the system's ability to absorb perturbations or shocks,
its ability to adapt to current and future changes, and its ability to learn
and create new types or directions of change. Responses to one stressor
alone may inadvertently undermine the capacity to address other
stressors, both in the present and future. For example, coastal towns in
eastern England, experiencing worsening coastal erosion exacerbated
by sea level rise, are taking their own action against immediate erosion
in order to protect livelihoods and homes, affecting sediments and erosion
rates down the coast (Milligan et al., 2009). While such actions to protect
the coast are effective in the short term, in the long term, investing to
‘hold the line’ may diminish capital resources for other adaptations and
hence reduce adaptive capacity to future sea level rise. Thus, dealing
with specific risks without a full accounting of the nature of system
resilience can lead to responses that can potentially undermine long-
term resilience. Despite an increasing emphasis on managing for
resilience (Walker et al., 2002; Lebel et al., 2006), the resilience lens
alone may not sufficiently illuminate how to enhance agency and move
from the understanding of complex dynamics to transformational
action.

"Children, the elderly, and women stand out as more vulnerable to
extreme climate and weather events. The vulnerability of children and
their capacity to respond to climate change and disasters is discussed in
Box 8-2 (see also Section 5.5.1 and Case Study 9.2.14). Among the
elderly, increasing numbers will become exposed to climate change
impacts in the coming decades, particularly in OECD countries where
populations are aging most rapidly. By 2050, it is estimated that one in
three people will be older than 60 years in OECD countries, as well as one
in five at the global scale (UN, 2002). The elderly are made additionally
vulnerable to climate change-related hazards by characteristics that also
increase vulnerability to other social and environmental hazards (thus
compounding overall vulnerability): deterioration of health, personal
lifestyles, social isolation, poverty, and inadequate access to health and
social infrastructures (OECD, 2006). Gender impacts vulnerability in
many ways. In the 1991 cyclone in Bangladesh, the death toll among
women was reportedly five times higher than among men (UNDP,
2007b). Cultural as well as physiological factors are widely cited for the
over-representation of female deaths from flooding. Gender inequality
extends into female-headed households to compound the vulnerability
of dependent children or elderly (Cannon, 2002; UNISDR, 2008; Oxfam,
2010). Inequality has many other important faces: race, caste, religious
affiliation, and physical disability, all of which help determine individual
and household vulnerability, and they cross-cut gender and age effects.
Importantly, the social construction of vulnerability through these
characteristics highlights the ways in which vulnerability changes over
time — in this case with changes in family structure and access to
services in response to economic cycles and political and cultural trends
evolving as the climate changes with potentially compounding effects
(Leichenko and O’Brien, 2008).

al., 2003; del Ninno and Lindberg, 2005; Balaban, 2006; Waterson, 2006; Bartlett, 2008). Vulnerability to these impacts in part is due to

times of disaster (Cutter, 1995; Bartlett, 2008; Peek, 2008).

risk communication processes of children, and their capacity to act as agents of change before, during, and after disaster events (see
collections of case studies in Peek, 2008; Back et al, 2009; and Tanner, 2010). Examples demonstrate the ability to reduce risk behavior

In areas in Bolivia that experienced the greatest incidence of extensive disasters, the gender gap in primary education achievement
widened, preschool enrollment rates decreased, and dropout rates increased. Equivalent areas in Nepal and Vietnam saw, respectively,
reduced primary enrollment rates and a drop in the total number of children in primary education. Extensive disasters also led to an
increased incidence of diarrhea in children under five years of age in Bolivia, an increased proportion of malnourished children under
three in Nepal, an increased infant mortality rate in Vietnam, and an increase in the incidence of babies born with low birth weight in
Mozambique. This study also found evidence of negative impacts in terms of access to water and sanitation in Mexico and Vietnam

what one part of society views as a win can be viewed by another part
as a loss. In examining possible responses to risks of climate extremes,
it is essential to recognize that possible impacts interact with vested
interests of different locations, sectors, and population groups in very
different ways. In virtually every case, the question is: benefits for
whom? Who says that this course of action is best for society as a
whole? What compensation is offered for those who are losers? In
particular, who is listening to views of those parts of society that have

"While individual events can be assessed as a snapshot of winners and
losers, climate change as an ongoing process has no final state. Over
time, it may produce different distributions of winners and losers, for
example, as areas experience positive and then negative consequences
of changes in temperature or precipitation. Whether or not a particular
place produces winners or losers from an extreme event or a combination
of climate extremes and other driving forces also depends on perceptions.
These may be shaped by the recovery process, but are strongly influenced
by prioritized values (Quarantelli, 1984, 1995; O'Brien, 2009; O’Brien
and Wolf, 2010). In considering winners and losers from extreme climate

agriculture or logging, can also be described as benefiting from decisions
that have generated vulnerability and prefigured disaster for others.
Such costs and benefits are often separated geographically and
temporally, making any efforts at distributional equity challenging. For
example, in the case of Hurricane Mitch, which killed more than 10,000
people and caused as much as US$ 8.5 billion in damages, deforestation

(O’Brien and Leichenko, 2003; Wisner, 2003). Lurking behind discourses
about winners and losers are issues of liability and compensation for
losses: that is, if a population or an area experiences severe losses due to
an extreme event (at least partly) attributed to climate change, can fault
be prescribed? Does responsibility lie with those who have generated
local environmental change through settling a hazard-exposed area,
those who have promoted or permitted such settlement, or those who
have failed to mitigate local hazard or global environmental change?

"Demographic and sociological diversity is also difficult to capture
in decisionmaking, where non-scientific knowledge is less easily
incorporated into formal decisionmaking. The importance of culture,
including traditional knowledge, in shaping strategies for adaptation is
recognized (Heyd and Brooks, 2009; ISET, 2010). There is a long tradition
of seeking to identify and bring such knowledge into planned disaster
risk management in urban and rural contexts through participatory and
community-based disaster risk management (Bruner et al., 2001;
Fearnside, 2001; Pelling, 2007; Mercer et al., 2008) and tools such as
participatory geographic information systems that explicitly seek to
bring scientific and local knowledge together (Tran et al., 2009). Both
development planning and post-disaster recovery have tended to
prioritize strategic economic sectors and infrastructure over local
livelihoods and poor communities (Maskrey, 1989, 1996). However, this

loss and its social and geographical distribution do differ significantly,
determined by the characteristics of those at risk and overarching

Smith, 1994). But some people also benefit from disasters. These may be
organizations or individuals who benefit economically from reconstruction

materials, equipment, and services — often at a premium price generated
by local scarcity and inflationary pressures (Benson and Clay, 2004) or
as a result of poorly managed tendering processes (Klein, 2007). Areas
not impacted by disaster can also experience economic benefits, for
example, in the Caribbean where hurricanes have caused international
tourist flows to be redirected (Pelling and Uitto, 2001). Political actors
can also benefit by demonstrating strong post-disaster leadership, at
times even when past political decisions have contributed to generating

"Despite the opportunities to enhance development, disaster response is
often better at meeting basic needs than securing or extending human

imperative makes any overt actions to promote human rights by
humanitarian actors difficult. In this way, disaster response and
reconstruction can to only a partial extent claim to enhance human
security (Pelling and Dill, 2009). Work at the boundaries between
humanitarian and development actors, new partnerships, the involvement
of government, and meaningful local participation are all emerging as ways
to resolve this challenge. One successful case has been the reconstruction
process in Aceh, Indonesia, following the Indian Ocean tsunami, where
collaboration between government and local political interests facilitated
by international humanitarian actions on the ground and through political-
level peace-building efforts have increased rights locally, contained

"Among the most widely discussed humanitarian and human security
issues related to climate change are the possibilities of increased migration

disruptions associated with climate change (Reuveny, 2007; O’Brien et
al., 2008; Raleigh et al., 2008; Warner et al., 2010). There are indications
that migration conditions followed disasters in the distant past, as well
as in current situations (see, e.g., Le Roy Ladurie, 1971; Kinzig et al.,
2006; Peeples et al., 2006). Migration is a key coping mechanism for
poor rural households, not only in extreme circumstances (e.g., during a
prolonged drought, as with the 20th-century US Dustbowl period and
Sahelian droughts) but also as a means of diversifying and increasing
income (Harrington et al, 2009; Oswald Spring, 2011a; Scheffran, 2011).
The opportunities that population movement opens for risk reduction are

internally within individual countries; that in most cases when climatic
extremes occur in developing countries they will not lead to net out-
migration because people tend to return to re-establish their lives after
a disaster; and that while long-term environmental changes may cause
more permanent migration this will also tend to be internal (Piguet,

stressful for migrants whose culture and sense of identity are affected
(Mortreux and Barnett, 2009; Brauch and Oswald Spring, 2011). The
social dislocation provoked by migration can lead to a breakdown in
traditional rural institutions and associated coping mechanisms, for
example, in the erosion of traditional community-based water management
committees in central and west Asia (Birkenholtz, 2008). Local collective
coping and adaptive capacity can also be limited by increases in the

with large disasters. Pakistan's 2010 floods have to date left an estimated
6 million people in need of shelter; India’s 2008 floods also uprooted
roughly 6 million people; Hurricane Katrina displaced more than half a
million people in the United States; and Cyclone Nargis uprooted
800,000 people in Myanmar and South Asia. However, the compound
effect of smaller, more frequent events can also contribute to displacement.
Hazards such as floods, although often causing relatively low mortality,
destroy many houses and hence cause considerable displacement.
Between 1970 and 2009 in Colombia, for example, 24 disaster loss
reports detailed floods that killed fewer than 10 people but destroyed
more than 500 houses. In total, around 26,500 houses were destroyed,
potentially displacing more than 130,000 people. In the Indian state of
Orissa, 265 floods with similar low mortality rates destroyed more than

importance of small or local disasters and the secondary disasters that

"In 2010, for example, western Russia experienced the hottest summer
since the beginning of systematic weather data recording 130 years
ago. Lack of rainfall in early 2010 and July temperatures almost 8°C
above the long-term average led to parched fields, forests, and peatlands
that posed a high wildfire risk. During and after the wildfires, Russia's
mortality rate increased by 18%. In August alone, 41,300 more people
died as compared to August 2009, due to both the extreme heat and
smoke pollution. Social and economic change had greatly increased the
risk posed by wildfires. Traditional agricultural livelihoods have declined,
accompanied by out-migration and reduced management of surrounding
forests, arguably exacerbated by the decentralization of national
management and increased exploitation by the private sector (UNISDR,
2011).

"The metaphor of tipping points, or points at which a system shifts from
one state to another, can also be applied to disaster events. Disasters
themselves are threshold-breaching events, where coping capacities of
communities are overwhelmed (e.g., Blaikie et al., 1994; Sperling et al.,
2008). Disasters may lead to secondary hazards, for example, when the
impacts from one disaster breach the coping capacities of related systems,
as when hurricane impacts trigger landslides or when different disasters
produce concatenated impacts over time (Biggs et al., 2011). For example,
losses associated with droughts and fires during the 1997/1998 El Nifio-
Southern Oscillation event in Central America increased landslide and
flood hazard during Hurricane Mitch in 1998 (Villagran de Leon, 2011).
Critical social thresholds may be crossed as disaster impacts spread
across society. Disaster response is as much about containing such losses
as assisting those hurt by the initial disaster impact.

"In many instances, climate change mitigation and adaptation may be
synergistic, such as land use planning to reduce transport-related energy
consumption and limit exposure to floods, or building codes to reduce
heating energy consumption and enhance robustness to heat waves

linkages between climate change mitigation and adaptation, and the
possibility of approaches that address both objectives simultaneously
(Wilbanks and Sathaye, 2007; Hallegatte, 2009; Bizikova et al., 2010;
Wilbanks, 2010; Yohe and Leichenko, 2010). In this section we enlarge
the scope of the interactions to include disaster risk management. This
builds on experience within the disaster management community that
has recently sought to integrate risk modeling (UNDP, 2004; UNISDR,
2009, 2011) and planning to consider multi-hazard contexts. An important
lesson from this is that avoiding superficial integration means seeking
out and addressing shared root causes of exposure and vulnerability to
hazards, and not just addressing the surface expressions of risk (Wisner,
2011). The extent of adaptation required will depend on the climate

"Tipping points in natural and human systems are more likely to arise
with relatively severe and/or rapid climate change than with moderate
levels and rates (Wilbanks et al., 2007). Because of this, less success with
climate change mitigation implies greater challenges for adaptation and
disaster risk management. Not only does adaptation need to consider
incremental change in hazard and vulnerability, but the possibility of
threshold breaching, systems-wide changes. The nonlinear changes
associated with breaching thresholds may exceed adaptation capacity
to avoid serious disruptions. Examples of ecological system changes of this
kind and social impacts include the disappearance of glaciers currently
feeding urban and agricultural water supply (Orlove, 2009), effects of
climate change on traditional livelihoods for the sustainability of
indigenous cultures (Turner and Clifton, 2009), widespread loss of corals
in acidifying oceans and fisher livelihoods (Reaser et al, 2000), and
profitability limits for important economic activities like agriculture,
fisheries, and tourism. When socioeconomic systems are already under
stress (e,g., fisheries in many countries), sustainability thresholds may be
more easily passed. Responses to potential thresholds or tipping points
include efforts to improve the information available to decisionmakers,
for example, through monitoring systems to provide early warning of an
impending system collapse (Biggs et al., 2009; Scheffer et al, 2009),
but also initiatives researching the balance of risks associated with
geoengineering (Royal Society, 2009) aiming to avoid such tipping
points (Virgoe, 2002; Kiehl, 2006).

"Practical integration of climate change mitigation and adaption into a
development context is complicated because of a differential distribution
in costs and benefits (e.g., mitigation benefits are distributed and
accrue globally; adaptation benefits, like disaster risk management, are
often easier to measure locally). In addition, the research and policy
discourses of these three policy domains are quite separated and in
areas technically unrelated, and the constituencies and decisionmakers
are often different (Wilbanks et al., 2007). In many cases, the challenge
of bringing the entire range of issues and options into focus — seeking
synergies and avoiding conflicts — is most likely to occur in discussions
of climate change responses and development objectives in particular
places: localities and small regions where compliance with national or
international mitigation agendas provides a logic for local action

"Urban planning can be a vehicle for synergy, but it takes time to produce
significant effects. Synergy in planning requires anticipation of future
climate change, taking into account how climate will change over many
decades, the uncertainty of this information, the vulnerability of urban
systems, and the capacity of social agents. The Asian Cities Climate
Change Resilience Network found that catalyzing city-level actors to
assess these plans are essential, rather than depending on external
experts or national agencies to prepare urban plans (Tyler et al., 2010).
Built forms are difficult to change because they exhibit strong inertia
and irreversibility: when a low-density city is created, transforming it
into a high-density city is a long, expensive, and difficult process
(Gusdorf et al., 2008). This point is crucial in the world's most rapidly
growing cities, where urban forms of the future are being decided based
on actions taken in the present, and where current trends indicate that
low-density, automobile-dependent forms of suburban settlement are
rapidly expanding (Solecki and Leichenko, 2006). Some work has started
to investigate these aspects of climate change adaptation and mitigation
(Newman et al., 1996). At the same time, there are specific opportunities

"in-an increasingly urbanized world, global sustainability in the context
of a changing climate will depend on achieving sustainable and climate-
resilient cities. Urban spatial form is critical for energy consumption,
emission patterns, and disaster risk management (Desplat et al., 2009),
and it influences where and how residents live and the modes of transport
that they use. Urban planning is a tool that can be used to pursue climate
change mitigation, adaptation, and disaster risk reduction as part of the
everyday development process (Newman and Kenworthy, 1989; Bento
et al., 2005; Handy et al., 2005; Ewing and Rong, 2008; Grazi et al.,
2008; Brownstone and Golob, 2009; Glaeser and Kahn, 2010). Urban
form also influences the spatial and social inequalities that largely shape
vulnerability, coping, and adaptive capacity (Pelling, 2003; Gusdorf
et al., 2008; Leichenko and Solecki, 2008). The historical failure of
urban planning in most developing country cities has had tremendous
environmental and social consequences (UN-HABITAT, 2009; World Bank,
2010a). Also in richer countries, where planning is not comprehensive,
maladaptation can take place rather than synergistic risk reduction, for
example, where urban heat wave risk management results in increased
private air conditioning without decarbonized energy available (Lindley et
al., 2006). Similarly, a denser city may reduce greenhouse gas emissions
but increase heat wave vulnerability (Hamin and Gurran, 2009).
However, since urban forms influence both greenhouse gas emissions
and vulnerability (McEvoy et al., 2006), scope for synergistic planning
and action can also be found. For example, managing car use may
contribute to decreased greenhouse gas emissions, but also lower local
particulate pollution and reduce the health impacts of urban heat waves
(Dennekamp and Carey, 2010).

"most marginalized and vulnerable. More typically, urbanization
compounds environmental problems. As countries urbanize, the risks
associated with economic asset loss tend to increase through rapid
growth in infrastructure and productive and social assets, while mortality
risk tends to decrease (Birkmann, 2006). As cities grow, they also modify
the surrounding rural environment, and consequently may generate a
significant proportion of the hazard to which they are also exposed. For
example, as areas of hinterland are paved over, runoff increases during
storms, greatly magnifying flood hazards (Mitchell, 1999; Pelling, 1999).
As mangroves are destroyed in coastal cities, storm-surge hazard can
increase (Hardoy et al., 2001). Likewise, within urban areas (though
often beyond the reach of urban planning), the expansion of informal
settlements can lead to increased local population exposure to landslide
and flood hazards (Satterthwaite, 1997; UNDP, 2004). Global risk
models indicate that expansion of urban risk is primarily due to rapidly
increasing exposure, which outpaces improvements in capacity to
reduce vulnerability (such as through improvements legislating and
applying building standards and land use planning), at least in rapidly
growing low- and middle-income nations (UNISDR, 2009, 2011). As
a consequence, risk is becoming increasingly urbanized (Mitchell,
1999; Pelling, 2003; Leichenko and O’Brien, 2008). There are dramatic
differences, nonetheless, between developed and developing countries.
In most developed countries (and increasingly in a number of cities in
middle-income countries, e.g., Bogota, Mexico City), risk-reducing
capacities exist that can manage increases in exposure. In contrast, in
much of the developing world (and particularly in the poorest least-
developed countries where large proportions of the urban population live
in unplanned settlements) such capacities are greatly restricted, while
population growth drives exposure. Financial and technical constraints
matter for risk management, but differences in wealth alone do not
explain differences in risk reduction investments, which also depend on
risk perceptions and political choice (e.g., Satterthwaite, 1998; Hardoy
et al., 2001; Hanson et al., 2011).

Lack of synergy is more the norm, to take just one example of urbanization

been occupied by natural water bodies and drains, vital to the regulation
of floods. The Dhaka Metropolitan Development Plan restricts development
in many of these areas, but despite the Plan, infilling continues with
both private- and public-sector projects. Destruction of retention ponds

exploited not by local actors to build local capacities but by external

locally. The balance and implementation of controls on natural resource
exploitation is both a potential damper on current capacity building and
a critical mechanism for ensuring long-term sustainability of rural
livelihoods and ecosystem services (Chouvy and Laniel, 2007). Non-farm
income now represents a substantial proportion of total income for
many rural households and can, in turn, increase resilience to weather-
and climate-related shocks (Brklacich et al., 1997; Smithers and Smit,

local rural risk, and how far they may provide scope for mitigation, has

While urban areas have expanded in size and influence, the majority of
the poor continue to reside in rural areas in many countries, particularly
in Africa, and are among the most resource-scare and capacity-limited
population groups (UNDP, 2009). For populations that may also be
isolated from markets and communication networks, even small increases
in the frequency or severity of hazard can cause local livelihoods to
collapse, though recent developments in communication technology may
bridge this gap (Aker and Mbiti, 2010). Where political and economic
systems disrupt food distribution and market functioning, vulnerability

"While urban sites offer opportunities for mitigation through diversified
(household) production and energy conservation, rural areas are a focus
for concentrated low- or no-carbon energy production ranging from
hydroelectric power (HEP) to solar and wind farms, biofuel crops, and
carbon sink functions associated with forestry in particular and REDD+
projects. These investments can have significant local impacts on disaster
risk through changes in land use and land cover that may influence
hydrology, or through economic effects and consequences for livelihoods.
There is scope for synergy, for example, through small HEP/flood or
water conservation dams, and some have gone as far to say that this
joined-up approach is part of a transformed development policy for
meeting combined energy and water demands in vulnerable rural
communities, most particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (Foster and Bricefio-
Garmendia, 2011). Some impacts can even go beyond local places.
Recent impacts of biofuel production on rural livelihoods and global
food security indicate the interdependence of vulnerability in rural and
urban systems, and the care required in transformations of this kind

markets (Dufey, 2006; de Fraiture et al., 2008).

"Disaster risk management and climate change adaptation are
fundamentally about planning for an uncertain future, a process that
involves combining one’s own aspirations (individual and collective)
with perspectives on what is to come (Stevenson, 2008). Planning for
the future is challenging when the stakes are high, values disputed,
and decisions urgent, and these factors often create tensions among
different visions of development. Typically, decisionmakers (representing
households, local or national governments, international institutions,
etc.) look to the future partly by remembering the past (e.g., projections
of the near future are often derived from recent experiences with extreme
events) and partly by projecting how the future might be different
(using forecasts, scenarios, visioning processes, or story lines — either
formal or informal) (Miller, 2007). Projections further into the future are
necessarily shrouded in larger uncertainties. The most common
approach for addressing these uncertainties is to develop multiple
visions of the future (quantitative scenarios or narrative storylines), that
in early years can be compared with actual directions of change

"Scenario development has traditionally been carried out in a sequential
manner (Moss et al., 2010). For example, a first step in developing climate
change scenarios has typically involved structural projections of key
determinants of greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., population changes,
urbanization, etc.). These have been used to estimate concentrations
and radiative forcing from emissions, leading to climate projections that
can be used in impacts research. One difficulty in using climate scenarios
for disaster risk management and climate change adaptation has been
the uncertainties associated with extreme climate and weather events,
including the behavior of local climates (see Section 3.2.3). Future
socioeconomic changes (e.g., demography, population preferences,
technologies) are also highly uncertain, thus scenarios must consider a
wide range of possible futures to design adaptation strategies and
analyze tradeoffs (e.g., Hall, 2007; Lempert, 2007; Lempert and Collins,
2007; WGBU, 2008; Dessai et al., 2009a,b; Hallegatte, 2009). Alternative
approaches have focused first on scenarios of radiative forcing, followed
by an analysis of the combinations of economic, technological,
demographic, policy, and institutional factors that can influence such
trajectories (Moss et al., 2010). Other approaches are based on robust
decisionmaking (e.g., Groves and Lempert, 2007; Lempert and Collins,
2007; Groves et al., 2008); information gap analysis (Hine and Hall,
2010); or on the search for co-benefits, no regrets strategies, flexibility,

highly robust scenarios may be hampered by conflicting understandings
of and practical approaches to uncertainty, different scalar needs, and
lack of training among users (Gawith et al., 2009). Experiences in
scenario building emphasize their usefulness for raising awareness on

public debates to policymaking and implementation, useful scenario

stakeholders view the region in coming decades, and on adaptation
decisions that are informed by political processes. One scenario
approach that explicitly acknowledges both social and environmental
uncertainties entails identification of flexible adaptation pathways for
managing the future risks associated with climate change (Yohe and
Leichenko, 2010). Based on principles of risk management (which
emphasize the importance of diversification and risk-spreading
mechanisms in order to improve social and/or private welfare in situations
of profound uncertainty), this approach can be used to identify a
sequence of adaptation strategies that are designed to keep society at
or below acceptable levels of risk. These strategies, which policymakers,
stakeholders, and experts develop and implement, are expected to
evolve over time as knowledge of climate change and associated climate
hazards progresses. The flexible adaptation or adaptive management
approach that underpins this also stresses the connections between
adaptation and mitigation of climate change, recognizing that climate

an acceptable level of risk (Yohe and Leichenko, 2010).

"In contrast to predictive scenarios and risk management approaches,
exploratory and normative approaches can be used to develop scenarios
that represent desirable alternative futures. This is particularly important
in the case of sustainability, where the most likely futures may not be
the most desirable (Robinson, 2003), and where poverty, inequity, and
injustice are recognized by many as incompatible with sustainable
development (Redclift 1987, 1992; St. Clair, 2010). Pathways that
require considerable transformation to reach sustainable futures of this
kind can be supported by backcasting techniques. The process of
backcasting involves developing normative scenarios that explore the
feasibility and implications of achieving certain desired outcomes
(Robinson, 2003; Carlsson-Kanyama et al., 2008). It is concerned with
how desirable futures can be attained, focusing on policy measures that
would be required to reach such conditions. Participatory backcasting,
which involves local stakeholders in visionary activities related to
sustainable development, can also open deliberative opportunities and
inclusiveness in decision framing and making. Where visioning is
repeated it can also open possibilities for tracking development and
learning processes that make up adaptive strategies for disaster risk
management, based on the explicit acknowledgement of the beliefs,
values, and preferences of citizens (Robinson, 2003). Changing attitudes

Among them, integrated environment-energy-economy models produce
long-term projections taking into account demographic, technological,
and economic trends (e.g., Edenhofer et al., 2006; Clarke and Weyant,
2009). These models can be used to assess the consequences of various
policies. However, most such models are at spatial and temporal scales
that do not resolve specific climate extremes or disasters (Hallegatte et
al., 2007). At higher spatial resolution, numerical models (e.g., input-
output models, calculable general equilibrium models) can help to
assess disaster consequences and, therefore, balance the cost of disaster
risk management actions and their benefits (Rose et al., 1997; Gordon
et al., 1998; Okuyama, 2004; Rose and Liao, 2005; Tsuchiya et al., 2007;
Hallegatte, 2008b). In particular, they can compare the cost of responding

"to disasters with the cost of preventing disasters. Since disasters have
intangible consequences (e.g., loss of lives, ecosystem losses, cultural
heritage losses, distributional consequences) that are difficult to measure
in economic terms, the quantitative models are necessary but not sufficient
to determine desirable policies and disaster risk management actions.
Whether incorporated in models or used in other forms of analysis, CBA
is useful to compare costs and benefits; but when intangibles play a
large role and when no consensus can be reached on how to value these
intangibles, other decisionmaking tools and approaches are needed.
Multi-criteria decisionmaking (Birkmann, 2006), robust decisionmaking
(e.g., Lempert 2007; Lempert and Collins, 2007), transition management
approaches (e.g., Kemp et al., 2007; Loorbach, 2010), and group-process
analytic-deliberative approaches (Mercer et al., 2008) are examples of
such alternative decisionmaking methodologies.

"Among the most successful disaster risk management and adaptation
efforts have been those that have facilitated the development of
partnerships between local leaders and other stakeholders, including
extra-local governments (Bicknell et al, 2009; Pelling and Wisner, 2009;
Gero et al, 2011). This allows local strength and priorities to surface in
disaster risk management, while acknowledging also that communities
(including local government) have limited resources and strategic scope
and alone cannot always address the underlying drivers of risk
(Bhattamishra and Barrett, 2010). Local programs are now increasingly
moving from a focus on strengthening disaster preparedness and
response to reducing both local hazard levels and vulnerability (e.g.,
through slope stabilization, flood control measures, improvements in
drainage, etc.) (Lavell, 2009; UNISDR, 2009; Reyos, 2010). Most of the
cases where sustainable local processes have emerged are where
national governments have decentralized both responsibilities and
resources to the local level, and where local governments have become
more accountable to their citizens, as for example in cities in Colombia

"Also necessary are indicators to measure the successes and failures of
policies. For example, climate change adaptation policies often target
the enhancement of adaptive capacity. The effects and outcomes of
policies are often measured using classical economic indicators such as
GDP. The limits of such indicators are well known, and have been
summarized in several recent reports (e.g., CMEPSP, 2009; OECD,
2009a). To measure progress toward a resilient and sustainable future,
one needs to include additional components, such as measures of
stocks, other capital types (natural capital, human capital, social capital),
distribution issues, and welfare factors (health, education, etc.). Many
alternative indicators have been proposed in the literature, but no
consensus exists. Examples of these alternative indicators include the
Human Development Index, the Genuine Progress Indicator, the Index of
Sustainable Economic Welfare, the Ecological Footprint, the normalized
GDP, and various indicators of vulnerability and adaptive capacity
(Costanza, 2000; Yohe and Tol, 2002; Lawn, 2003; Costanza et al., 2004;

"Institutional innovations aimed at improving the availability of disaster
information to decisionmakers include the creation of national or
regional institutions to manage and distribute disaster risk information
(von Hesse et al., 2008; Corfee-Morlot et al., 2011), bringing together
previously fragmented efforts centered in national meteorological,
geological, oceanographic, and other agencies. The World Meteorological
Organization and partner organizations have proposed the creation of
a Global Framework for Climate Services, a collaborative effort to help
the global community to better adapt to climate variability and change
by developing and incorporating science-based climate information and
prediction into planning, policy, and practice (WCC-3, 2009). New open-
source tools for comprehensive probabilistic risk assessment are beginning
to offer ways of compiling information at different scales and from
different institutions (OECD, 2009b). A growing number of countries are
also systematically recording disaster loss and impacts at the local level
(DesInventar, 2010) and developing mechanisms to use such information
to inform and guide public investment decisions (Comunidad Andina,
2007, 2009; von Hesse et al., 2008) and national planning. Unfortunately,
there is as yet only limited experience with the integrated deployment
of such tools and institutional approaches, especially in ways that cross
scales of risk management strategy development and decisionmaking,
and very limited evaluations of such deployment.

"If extreme climate and weather events increase significantly in coming
decades, climate change adaptation and disaster risk management are
likely to require not only incremental changes, but also transformative
changes in systems and institutions. Transformation can be defined as a
fundamental qualitative change, or a change in composition or structure
that is often associated with changes in perspectives or initial conditions
(see Box 8-1). It often involves a change in paradigm and may include
shifts in perception and meaning, changes in underlying norms and
values, reconfiguration of social networks and patterns of interaction,
changes in power structures, and the introduction of new institutional
arrangements and regulatory frameworks (Folke et al., 2009, 2010;
Pahl-Wostl, 2009; Smith and Stirling, 2010).

"Although transformational policies and measures may be deliberately
invoked as a strategy to reduce disaster risk and adapt to climate change,
in many cases such strategies are precipitated by an extreme event,
sometimes referred to as a ‘focusing event’ (Birkland, 1996). However,
whether an extreme event leads to any change at all is unclear, as
processes of policy change are often subtle and complex and linked to
learning processes (Birkland, 2006). Exploring the relationship between
systematic learning processes and small disasters, Voss and Wagner
(2010) find that a failure to learn is the most common prerequisite for
future disasters. There are, however, many dimensions to learning (e.g.,
cognitive, normative, and relational; see Huitema et al., 2010), and
learning may be a necessary but insufficient condition for initiating
transformational change.

"Understanding processes of deliberate change and change management
can provide insights on societal responses to extreme climate and
weather events. Traditional approaches to managing change successfully
in businesses and organizations focus on a series of defined steps
(Harvard Business Essentials, 2003). Kotter (1996), for example, identifies
an eight-step process for promoting change: (1) create a sense of urgency;
(2) pull together the guiding team; (3) develop the change vision and
strategy; (4) communicate for understanding and buy in; (5) empower
others to act; (6) produce short-term wins; (7) don’t let up; and (8)
create a new culture. Kotter (1995) also identifies eight errors that are

"Disaster risk management and adaptation can also be addressed
through the enhancement of generic adaptive capacity alongside hazard-
specific response strategies (IFRC, 2010). This capacity includes access
to information, the skills and resources needed to reflect upon and apply
new knowledge, and institutions to support inclusive decisionmaking.
These are cornerstones of both sustainability and resilience. While
uncertainty may make it difficult for decisionmakers to commit funds for
hazard-specific risk reduction actions, these barriers do not prevent
investment in generic foundations of resilient and sustainable societies
(Pelling, 2010a). Importantly, from such foundations, local actors may
be able to make better-informed choices on how to manage risk in their
own lives, certainly over the short and medium terms. For instance,
federations formed by slum dwellers have become active in identifying and
acting on disaster risk within their settlements and seeking partnerships
with local governments to make this more effective and larger scale
(IFRC, 2010).

"Risk transfer instruments, such as insurance, reinsurance, insurance
pools, catastrophe bonds, micro-insurance, and other mechanisms, shift
economic risk from one party to another and thus provide compensation
in exchange for a payment, often a premium (ex-post effect) (see
Sections 5.6.3, 6.5.3, and 7.4, and Case Study 9.2.13). In addition, these
mechanisms can also help to anticipate and reduce (economic) risk as
they reduce volatility and increase economic resilience at the household,
national, and regional levels (Linnerooth-Bayer et al., 2005). As one
example, with such insurance, drought-exposed farmers in Malawi have
been able to access improved seeds for higher yielding and higher risk
crops, thus helping them to make a leap ahead in terms of generating
higher incomes and the adoption of higher return technologies (World
Bank, 2005; Hazell and Hess, 2010). However, many obstacles to such
schemes still exist, particularly in low-income and many middle-income
countries, including the absence of comprehensive risk assessments and
required data, legal frameworks, and the necessary infrastructure, and
probably more experience is required to determine the contexts in
which they can be effective (Linnerooth-Bayer and Mechler, 2007;

As discussed in Section 8.5.2, there are winners and losers not only from
extreme climate and weather events, but also from responses.
Consequently, fundamental change is often resisted by the people that it
affects the most (Kotter, 1996; Kegan and Lahey, 2009). Helping people,
groups, organizations, and governments to manage the resulting

"Transformative changes that move society towards the path of
openness and adaptability depend not only on changes in mindsets, but
also on changes in systems and structures. Case studies of social-
ecological systems suggest that there are three phases involved in systems
transformations. The first phase includes being prepared, or preparing
the system, for change. The second phase calls for navigating the
transition by making use of a sudden crisis as an opportunity for
change, whether the crisis is real or perceived. The third phase involves
building resilience of the new system (Olsson et al., 2004; Chapin et al.,
2010). Traditional management approaches emphasize the reduction of
uncertainties, with the expectation that this will lead to systems that
can be predicted and controlled. However, in the case of climate change,
future projections of climate variables and extremes will contain
uncertainty (see Section 3.2.3). Consequently, there is a need for
management approaches that are adaptive and robust in the presence
of large and irreducible uncertainties.

"Many of the recent approaches to change and transformation focus on
learning organizations, and the importance of changing individual and
collective mindsets or mental models (Senge, 1990; Heifetz et al., 2009;
Kegan and Lahey, 2009; Scharmer, 2009). This transformational change
literature distinguishes between technical problems that can be
addressed through management based on existing organizational and
institutional structures and cultural norms, and adaptive challenges that
require a change in mindsets, including changes in assumptions, beliefs,
priorities, and loyalties (Heifetz et al, 2009; Kegan and Lahey, 2009).
Treating disaster risk management and climate change adaptation as
technical problems may focus attention only on improving technologies,
reforming institutions, or managing displaced populations, whereas
viewing them as an adaptive challenge shifts attention toward gaps
between values and behaviors (e.g., values that promote human security
versus policies or behaviors that undermine health and livelihoods),
beliefs (e.g., a belief that disasters are inevitable or that adaptation will
occur autonomously), and competing commitments (e.g., a commitment
to maintaining aid dependency or preserving social hierarchies).

"transformation in and of itself is not always desirable. It is a complex process that involves changes at the personal, cultural, institutional,
and systems levels. Transformation can imply the loss of the familiar, which can create a sense of disequilibrium and uncertainty. In
some cases, notable changes in the nature, form, or appearance of a system or process may be inconsistent with the values and preferences
of some groups. Transformation can thus be perceived as threatening by some and instrumental by others, as the potential for real or
perceived winners and losers at different scales stimulates social unease or tension. Desirable or not, it is important to recognize that
transformations are now occurring at an unprecedented rate and scale, influenced by globalization, social and technological development,
and environmental change. Climate change itself represents a system-scale transformation that will have widespread consequences for
ecology and society, including through changes in climate extremes. Responses to climate change and changes in disaster risk can be
both incremental and transformational. Transformational responses are not always radical or monumental — sometimes they simply
involve a questioning of assumptions or viewing a problem from a new perspective. Transformational responses are not only possible,
but they can be facilitated through learning processes, especially reflexive learning that explores blind spots in current thinking and
approaches to disaster risk management and climate change adaptation. However, because there are risks and barriers, transformation
also calls for leadership — not only from authority figures who hold positions and power, but from individuals and groups who are able
to connect present-day actions with their values, and with a collective vision for a sustainable and resilient future. Considering the
balance between incremental and transformative adjustments flags the importance of scale: first, because of the opportunities for
enhancing leadership capacity that come from greater involvement of those locally at risk or undertaking adaptive experimentation for
risk management; and second, because of the potential for transformation, incremental change, or stability at one systems level or sector
(e.g., administrative, social, technical) to provoke or restrict adjustments in other systems and scales. Inter-scale and inter-sectoral
communication therefore become important tools for managing adaptive disaster risk management.

ongoing socio-cultural and institutional learning processes. This can be

"The dynamic notion of adaptation calls for learning as an iterative
process in order to build resilience and enhance adaptive capacity now,
rather than targeting adaptation in the distant future (see Section 1.4.2).
Social and collective learning includes support for joint problem solving,
power sharing, and iterative reflection (Berkes, 2009). The need to take
into account the arrival of new information in the design of response
strategies has also been mentioned for mitigation policies (Ha Duong et
al., 1997; Ambrosi et al., 2003). Adaptive management is an incremental
and iterative learning-by-doing process, whereby participants make sense
of system changes, engage in actions, and finally reflect on changes and
actions. Lessons from learning theories, including experiential learning
(Kolb, 1984) and transformative learning (Mezirow, 1995), stress the
importance of learning-by-doing in concrete learning cycles, problem-

shared platforms for dialogs and participatory vulnerability assessments
that include a wide range of stakeholders (see ISET, 2010). It is equally
important to acknowledge that abrupt and surprising changes may
surpass existing skills and memory (Batterbury, 2008). Adaptation projects
have demonstrated that fostering adaptive capacity and managing
uncertainty in real-time, by adjusting as new information, techniques, or
conditions emerge, especially among populations exposed to multiple
risks and stressors, is more effective than more narrowly designed
planning approaches that target a given impact and are dependent on
particular future climate information (McGray et al., 2007; Pettengell,

"In general terms, adaptive management can be defined as a structured
process for improving management policies and practices by systemic
learning from the outcomes of implemented strategies, and by taking
into account changes in external factors in a proactive manner (Pahl-

management can contribute to a more process-oriented approach to
disaster risk management, and have already shown some success in
promoting sustainable natural resource management under conditions
of uncertainty (Medema et al., 2008). Adaptive management is often
associated with ‘adaptive’ organizations that are not locked into rigid
agendas and practices, such that they can consider new information, new
challenges, and new ways of operating (Berkhout et al., 2006; Pelling et
al, 2007). Organizations that can monitor environmental, economic,
and social conditions and changes, respond to shifting policies and
leadership changes, and take advantage of opportunities for innovative
interventions are a key to resilience, especially with respect to conceivable
but long-term and/or relatively low-probability events. Those social
systems that appear most adept at adapting are able to integrate formal
organizational roles with cross-cutting informal social spaces for learning,
experimentation, communication, and for trust-based and speedy disaster
response that is nonetheless accountable to beneficiaries (Pelling et al.,

"An important attribute of the humanitarian sector is its readiness to learn. Research and learning unfolds at multiple levels, including
sector-wide reviews of performance and practice such as those undertaken by the Active Learning Network for Accountability and
Performance in Humanitarian Action. Research and learning is also structured around the internal needs of organizations (e.g., Red Cross
and Red Crescent Societies) or the outcomes of individual events (e.g., the landmark report on humanitarian sector practice following
the Indian Ocean tsunami (Telford et al., 2006). Organizations have different methodologies, target audiences, and frames of reference,
making cross-sector learning difficult (Amin and Goldstein, 2008), but they all have led to practical and procedural changes. Less well-
developed is active experimentation in the field of practice, with a view of proactive learning (Corbacioglu and Kapucu, 2006). This is
difficult in the humanitarian sector, where stakes are high and rapid action has typically made it difficult to implement learning-while-doing
experiments. Where experimentation may be more observable, for example, in disaster prevention and risk reduction or reconstruction
activities, there are significant gaps in documentation that have slowed down the transferring of learning outcomes between organizations.
Hierarchical models of governance have fostered a lack of cooperation and generated competition between agencies within the
humanitarian and development sectors, partly explaining why there is more learning based on the sharing of experience inside
organizations than across sectors (Kapucu, 2009). But the increasing scale and diversity of risk associated with climate change, and

"Leadership can be critical for disaster risk management and climate
change adaptation, particularly in initiating processes and sustaining
them over time (Moser and Ekstrom, 2010). Change processes are shaped
both by the action of individual champions (as well as by those resisting
change) and their interactions with organizations, institutional structures,
and systems. Leadership can be a driver of change, providing direction and
motivating others to follow, thus the promotion of leaders by institutions
is considered an important component of adaptive capacity (Gupta et al.,
2010), although knowledge about how to create and enable leadership
remains elusive. Leadership and leaders often do not develop independent
of the institutional context, which includes institutional rules, resources,
and organizational culture (Kingdon, 1995).

"The impacts of climate change in many regions are
predominantly linked to the water system, in particular
through increased exposure to floods and droughts (Lehner
et al., 2006; Smith and Barchiesi, 2009; see Section 2.5).
Considering water as a key structuring element or guiding
principle for landscape management and land use planning
requires technology, integrated systems thinking, and the art
of thinking in terms of attractiveness and mutual influence, or
even mutual consent, between different authorities, experts,
interest groups, and the public. One of the most pronounced
changes can be observed in The Netherlands, where the
government has requested a radical rethinking of water
management in general and flood management in particular.
The resulting policy stream, initiated through the ‘Room for the
River’ (Ruimte voor de Rivier) policy, has strongly influenced
other areas of government policy. Greater emphasis is now
given to the integration of water management and spatial
planning, with the regulating services provided by landscapes
with natural flooding regimes being highly valued. This
requires a revision of land use practices and reflects a gradual
movement toward integrated landscape planning, whereby
water is recognized as a natural, structural element. The societal
debate about the plans to build in deep-lying polders and
other hydrologically unfavorable spots, and new ideas on
floating cities, indicate a considerable social engagement of
both public and private parties with the issue of sustainable
landscapes and water management. However, although such
innovative ideas have been adopted in policy, they take time
to implement, as there is considerable social resistance
(Wolsink, 2006).

approach in responding to emergency events and disaster relief, such
top-down command and control frameworks work less well in disaster

risk management. In such systems, it is often the most vulnerable to

"Engaging possible and desirable futures and options for decisionmaking
fosters knowledge generation essential for adaptive risk management
as well as iterative change processes. Zooming in on uncertain elements
and their potential impacts (e.g., changes in rainfall and variability)
and identifying factors that currently limit adaptive capacity (e.g.,
marginalization, lack of access to resources, or information gaps) allows
for more robust decisionmaking that also integrates local contexts (asset
portfolios, spreading and managing risks) with the climate context
(current trends, likely futures, and uncertainties) to identify the most
feasible, appropriate, and equitable response strategies, policies, and
external interventions (Pettengell, 2010). Creating space and recognizing
a diversity of voices often means reframing what counts as knowledge,
engaging uncertainties, nourishing the capacity for narrative imagination,
and articulating agency and strategic adaptive responses in the face of
already experienced changes and to anticipate and prepare for future
disturbances and shocks (Tschakert and Dietrich, 2010).

"The uncertainty that comes with climatic variability and extremes reinforces arguments for better coordination and accountability within
governance hierarchies and across sectors, as well as between generations and for non-human species in development. Local, national,
and international actors bring different strengths and tools to questions of environmental change and its relationship to trends in
human development. While offering a range of specific practical measures, both local and national approaches to risk management can
better meet the flexibility demands of adaptation and resilience when they have strong, accountable leadership, and are enhanced by
systematic experimentation and support for innovation in the development of tools as part of planned adaptive risk management
approaches. International actors can help by providing an institutional framework to support experimentation, innovation, and flexibility.
This can be part of national and local strategies to move development away from incentives that promote short-term gain and toward
those that promote longer-term sustainability and flexibility.
"	Text
"The disruptions caused by disaster events often reveal development failures. They also provide an opportunity for reconsidering
development through reconstruction and disaster risk reduction. Practical steps can address both the root causes of risk found in
development relations, including enhancing human rights, gender equity, and environmental integrity, and more proximate causes
expressed most commonly through a need for extending land and property rights, access to critical services and basic needs, including
social safety nets and insurance mechanisms, and transparent decisionmaking, especially at the local level. Identifying the drivers of
hazard and vulnerability in ways that empower both those at risk and risk managers to take action is key. This can be done best where
local and scientific knowledge is combined in the generation of risk maps or risk management plans. Greater use of local knowledge
when coupled with local capacity can initiate enhanced accountability in integrated risk decisionmaking that helps to break unsustainable
development relations.
"	Text
"legal frameworks, policy, and planning can be considered key to
reconciling short- and long-term goals for vulnerability reduction. Even
where capacity is present, it can take effort to shift into more critical,
learning modes of governance (Corbacioglu and Kapucu, 2006).
Moreover, anticipating vulnerabilities as well as feasible and fair actions
may also reveal limits of adaptation and risk management, and thus
raise the potential need for transformation. Because transformative
changes open up questions about the values and priorities shaping
development and risk futures, who wins and loses, and the balance of
tradeoffs, decisions about when and where to facilitate transformative
change and to whose benefit are inherently normative and political.
Transformation cannot be approached without understanding related
ethical and governance dimensions. At the same time, incremental
changes, in supporting many aspects of business-as-usual, also possess
implicit ethical and normative aspects. At heart, it is perhaps in failing
to fully reveal and question these normative positions that current
disaster risk management practice and policy has remained outside
of development planning and policy processes, inhabiting a long
acknowledged, but still present ‘disasters archipelago’ in the policy
world (Hewitt, 1983, p. 12).

"Actions to reduce disaster risk and responses to climate change
invariably involve tradeoffs with other societal goals, and conflicts
related to different values and visions for the future. Innovative and
successful solutions that combine multiple perspectives, differing
worldviews, and contrasting ways of organizing social relations have been
described by Verweij et al. (2006) as ‘clumsy solutions.’ Such solutions,
they argue, depend on institutions in which all perspectives are heard
and responded to, and where the quality of interactions among competing
viewpoints foster creative alternatives. Drawing on the development
ethics literature, St. Clair (2010) notes that when conflict and broad-
based debate arise, alternatives often flourish and many potential
spaces for action can be created, tapping into people's innovation and
capacity to cope, adapt, and build resilience. Pelling (2010a) stresses
the importance of social learning for transitional or transformational
adaptation, and points out that it requires a high level of trust, a
willingness to experiment and accept the possibility of failure in
processes of learning and innovation, transparency of values, and active
engagement of civil society. Committing to such a learning process is,
as Tschakert and Dietrich (2010, p. 17) argue, preferable to alternatives
because “learning by shock is neither an empowering nor an ethically
defensible pathway.”

"(where the knowledge of women, children, or the elderly may not be
recognized), within communities (where divisions among social groups
may hinder learning), or within nations (where marginalized groups may
not be heard, and where social division and political power influence
the development and adaptation agenda). Disaster periods are frequently
the times when the development visions and aspirations for the future
of those most affected are not recognized. This reflects a widespread
limitation on the quality and comprehensiveness of local participation
in disaster risk reduction and its integration into everyday development
planning. Instead, the humanitarian imperative, limited-term reconstruction
budgets, and an understandable desire for rapid action over deliberation
means that too often international social movements and humanitarian
nongovernmental organizations, government agencies, and local relief
organizations impose their own values and visions, often with the best
of intentions. It is also important to recognize the potential for some
people or groups to prevent sustainable decisions by employing their
veto power or lobbying against reforms or regulations based on short-
term political or economic interests (Klein, 2007). The distribution of
power in society and who has the responsibility or right to shape the
future through decisionmaking today is thus significant, and includes
the role of international as well as national and local actors. Within the
international humanitarian community, efforts such as the Sphere
Standards and the Humanitarian Accountability Partnership are steps
toward addressing this challenge.

"	Title
"The case studies chosen to reflect vulnerable regions demonstrate how a changing climate provides significant concerns
for people, societies, and their infrastructure. These are: Mumbai as an example of a coastal megacity; the Republic of
the Marshall Islands, as an example of small island developing states with special challenges for adaptation; and
Canada’s northern regions as an example of cold climate vulnerabilities focusing on infrastructures.
"	Text
"Four types of methodologies or approaches to disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA) are
presented. Early warning systems; effective legislation; risk transfer in developing countries; and education, training,
and public awareness initiatives are the approaches demonstrated. The case studies demonstrate that current disaster
risk management (DRM) and CCA policies and measures have not been sufficient to avoid, fully prepare for, and
respond to extreme weather and climate events, but these examples demonstrate progress.
"	Text
"Case studies contribute more focused analyses which, in the context of human loss and damage, demonstrate the
effectiveness of response strategies and prevention measures and identify lessons about success in disaster risk reduction
and climate change adaptation. The case studies were chosen to complement and be consistent with the information
in the preceding chapters, and to demonstrate aspects of the key messages in the Summary for Policymakers and the
Hyogo Framework for Action Priorities.
"	Text
"The case studies were grouped to examine types of extreme events, vulnerable regions, and methodological approaches.
For the extreme event examples, the first two case studies pertain to events of extreme temperature with moisture
deficiencies in Europe and Australia and their impacts including on health. These are followed by case studies on drought
in Syria and dzud, cold-dry conditions in Mongolia. Tropical cyclones in Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Mesoamerica, and
then floods in Mozambique are discussed in the context of community actions. The last of the extreme events case
studies is about disastrous epidemic disease, using the case of cholera in Zimbabwe, as the example.
"	Text
"A common factor was the need for greater information on risks before the events occur, that is, early warnings. The
implementation of early warning systems does reduce loss of lives and, to a lesser extent, damage to property and
was identified by all the extreme event case studies (heat waves, wildfires, drought, dzud, cyclones, floods, and
epidemic disease) as key to reducing impacts from extreme events. A need for improving international cooperation
and investments in forecasting was recognized in some of the case studies but equally the need for regional and local
early warning systems was heavily emphasized, particularly in developing countries.
"	Text
"A further common factor identified overall was that it is better to invest in preventative-based DRR plans, strategies,
and tools for adaptation than in response to extreme events. Greater investments in proactive hazard and vulnerability
reduction measures, as well as development of capacities to respond and recover from the events were demonstrated to
have benefits. Specific examples for planning for extreme events included increased emphasis on drought preparedness;
planning for urban heat waves; and tropical cyclone DRM strategies and plans in coastal regions that anticipate these
events. However, as illustrated by the small island developing states case study, it was also identified that DRR planning
approaches continue to receive less emphasis than disaster relief and recovery.
"	Text
"One recurring theme is the value of investments in knowledge and information, including observational and monitoring
systems, for cyclones, floods, droughts, heat waves, and other events from early warnings to clearer understanding of
health and livelihood impacts. In all cases, the point is made that with greater information available it would be
possible to know the risks better and ensure that response strategies were adequate to face the coming threat.
Research improves our knowledge, especially when it integrates the natural, social, health, and engineering sciences
and their applications. The case studies have reviewed past events and identified lessons which could be considered
for the future. Preparedness through DDR and DRM can help to adapt to climate change and these case studies offer
examples of measures that could be taken to reduce the damage that is inflicted as a result of extreme events.
Investment in increasing knowledge and warning systems, adaptation techniques, and tools and preventive measures
will cost money now but will save money and lives in the future.

useful in evaluating some current disaster response practices.

"The case studies chosen to reflect a few vulnerable regions all demonstrate
how a changing climate provides significant concerns for people,
societies, and their infrastructure. The case of Mumbai is used as an
example of a coastal megacity and its risks. Small island developing
states have special challenges for adaptation, with the Republic of the
Marshall Islands being the case study focus. Cold climate vulnerabilities,
particularly the infrastructure in Canada’s northern regions, provide the
final vulnerable region case study.
"	Text
"In this chapter, case studies are used as examples of how to gain a better
understanding of the risks posed by extreme weather and climate-related
events while identifying lessons and best practices from past responses
to such occurrences. Using the information in Chapters 1 to 8, it was
possible to focus on particular examples to reflect the needs of the
whole Special Report. The chosen case studies are illustrative of an
important range of disaster risk reduction, disaster risk management,
and climate change adaptation issues. They are grouped to examine
representative types of extreme events, vulnerable regions, and
methodological approaches.
"	Text
"Following examples of extreme events and vulnerable regions, this
chapter presents case study examination of four types of methodologies
or approaches to DRR and CCA. Early warning systems provide the
opportunity for adaptive responses to reduce impacts. Effective legislation
to provide multi-level governance is another way of reducing impacts.
The case study on risk transfer examines the role of insurance and other
instruments in developing countries. The final case study is on education,
training, and public awareness initiatives. This selection provides a good
basis of information and serves as an indicator of the resources needed
for future DRR and CCA. Additionally, it allows good practices to be
identified and lessons to be extracted.
"	Text
"For the extreme event examples, the first two case studies pertain to
extreme temperature with moisture deficiencies: the European heat waves
of 2003 and 2006 and response to disaster induced by hot weather and
wildfires in Australia. Managing the adverse consequences of drought is
the third case study, with the focus on Syrian droughts. The combination
of drought and cold is examined through two recent dzud disasters in
Mongolia, 1999-2002 and 2009-2010. Tropical cyclones in Bangladesh,
Myanmar, and Mesoamerica are used as examples of how a difference
can be made via enabling policies and responsive institutions for
community action. The next case study shifts the geographical focus to
floods in Mozambique in 2000 and 2007. The last of the extreme events
case studies is about disastrous epidemic disease, using the case of cholera
in Zimbabwe, as the example.
"	Text
"This chapter addresses events whose impacts were felt in many
dimensions. A single event can produce effects that are felt on local,
regional, national, and international levels. These effects could have
been the direct result of the event itself, from the response to the event,
or through indirect impacts such as a reduction in food production or a
decrease in available resources. In addition to the spatial scales, this
chapter also addresses temporal scales, which vary widely in both
event-related impacts and responses. However, the way effects are felt
is additionally influenced by social, health, and economic factors. The
resilience of a society and its economic capacity to allay the impact of
a disaster and cope with the after effects has significant ramifications
for the community concerned (UNISDR, 2008a). Developing countries with
fewer resources, experts, equipment, and infrastructure have been shown
to be particularly at risk (see Chapter 5). Developed nations are usually
better equipped with technical, financial, and institutional support to enable
better adaptive planning including preventive measures and/or quick and
effective responses (Gagnon-Lebrun and Agrawala, 2006). However, they
still remain at risk of high-impact events, as exemplified by the European
heat wave of 2003 and by Hurricane Katrina (Parry et al., 2007).
"	Text
"Case studies are widely used in many disciplines including health care
(Keen and Packwood, 1995; McWhinney, 2001), social science (Flyvbjerg,
2004), engineering, and education (Verschuren, 2003). In addition, case
studies have been found to be useful in previous IPCC Assessment
Reports, including the 2007 Working Group II report (Parry et al., 2007).
Case studies offer records of innovative or good practices. Specific
problems or issues experienced can be documented as well as the actions
taken to overcome these. Case studies can validate our understanding
and encourage re-evaluation and learning. It is apparent that (i) case
studies capture the complexity of disaster risk and disaster situations;
(ii) case studies appeal to a broad audience; and (iii) case studies should
be fully utilized to provide lessons identified for DRR and DRM for
adaptation to climate change (Grynszpan et al., 2011). Several projects
have identified lessons from case studies (Kulling et al., 2010). The
Forensic Investigation of Disaster (Burton, 2011; FORIN, 2011) Project of
the Integrated Research on Disaster Risk (ICSU, 2008) program has
developed a methodology and template for future case study investigations
to provide a basis for future policy analysis and literature for assessments.
The FORIN template lays out the elements: (a) critical cause analysis; (b)
meta-analysis; (c) longitudinal analysis; and (d) scenarios of disasters.

"Extreme heat is a prevalent public health
concern throughout the temperate regions of
the world and extreme heat events have been
encountered recently in North America, Asia,
Africa, Australia, and Europe. It is very likely
that the length, frequency, and/or intensity
of warm spells, including heat waves, will
continue to increase over most land areas
(Section 3.3.1). As with other types of
hazards, extreme heat can have disastrous
consequences, particularly for the most
vulnerable populations. Risk from extreme heat
is a function of hazard severity and population
exposure and vulnerability. Extreme heat
events do not necessarily translate into
extreme impacts if vulnerability is low. It is
important, therefore, to consider factors that
contribute to hazard exposure and population
vulnerability. Recent literature has identified
a host of factors that can amplify or dampen
hazard exposure. Experience with past heat
waves and public health interventions suggest
that it is possible to manipulate many of
these variables to reduce both exposure and
vulnerability and thereby limit the impacts of
extreme heat events. This case study, which
compares the European heat wave of 2003
with 2006, demonstrates developments in
disaster risk management and adaptation to
climate change.

"As with other types of hazards, extreme heat events can have disastrous
consequences, partly due to increases in exposure and particular types
of vulnerabilities. However, it is important to note that reducing the

further actions, some of which may be resource intensive and further
exacerbate climate change.

"In addition to increased demand, there can be a risk of reduced output
from power generating plants (UNEP, 2004). The ability of inland thermal
power plants, both conventional and nuclear, to cool their generators is
restricted by rising river temperatures. Additionally, fluctuating levels of
water availability will affect energy outputs of hydropower complexes.
During the summer of 2003 in France, six power plants were shut down
and others had to control their output (Parry et al., 2007).

Africa (NASA, 2008), Australia (DSE, 2008b), and Europe (Robine et al.,

"Systems of power generation and transmission partly explain vulnerability
since electricity supply underpins air conditioning and refrigeration — a
significant adaptation strategy particularly in developed countries, but
one that is also at increased risk of failure during a heat wave (Sailor
and Pavlova, 2003). It is expected that demand for electricity to power
air conditioning and refrigeration units will increase with rising ambient
temperatures. Areas with lower power capacities face increased risk of
disruptions to generating resources and transmission under excessive
heat events.

"Research has also identified that, at least in the North American and
European cities where the phenomenon has been studied, these factors
can have a significant impact on the magnitude of heat hazards on a
neighborhood level (Harlan et al., 2006). One study in France has shown
that higher mortality rates occurred in neighborhoods in Paris that were
characterized by higher outdoor temperatures (Cadot et al., 2007). High
temperatures can also affect transport networks when heat damages
roads and rail tracks. Within cities, outdoor temperatures can vary
significantly (Akbari and Konopacki, 2004), resulting in the need to
focus preventive strategies on localized characteristics.

"Physiological: Several factors influence vulnerability to heat-related
illness and death. Most of the research related to such vulnerability is
derived from experiences in industrialized nations. Several physiological
factors, such as age, gender, body mass index, and preexisting health
conditions, play a role in the body's ability to respond to heat stress. Older
persons, babies, and young children have a number of physiological and
social risk factors that place them at elevated risk, such as decreased
ability to thermoregulate (the ability to maintain temperature within the
narrow optimal physiologic range; Havenith, 2001). Preexisting chronic
disease — more common in the elderly — also impairs compensatory
responses to sustained high temperatures (Havenith, 2001; Shimoda,
2003). Older adults tend to have suppressed thirst impulse resulting in
dehydration and increased risk of heat-related illness. In addition, multiple
diseases and/or drug treatments increase the risk of dehydration
(Hodgkinson et al., 2003; Ebi and Meehl, 2007).
"	Text
"Social: A wide range of socioeconomic factors are associated with
increased vulnerability (see Sections 2.3 and 2.5). Areas with high crime
rates, low social capital, and socially isolated individuals had increased
vulnerability during the Chicago heat wave in 1995 (Klinenberg, 2002).
People in areas of low socioeconomic status are generally at higher risk
of heat-related morbidity and mortality due to higher prevalence of
chronic diseases — from cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension to
pulmonary disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
asthma (Smoyer et al., 2000; Sheridan, 2003). Minorities and communities
of low socioeconomic status are also frequently situated in higher heat
stress neighborhoods (Harlan et al., 2006). Protective measures are
often less available for those of lower socioeconomic status, and even if
air conditioning, for example, is available, some of the most vulnerable
populations will choose not to use it out of concern over the cost (O'Neill
et al., 2009). Other groups, like the homeless and outdoor workers, are
particularly vulnerable because of their living situation and being more
acutely exposed to heat hazards (Yip et al., 2008). Older persons may also
often be isolated and living alone, and this may increase vulnerability
(Naughton et al., 2002; Semenza, 2005).
"	Text
"Addressing vulnerabilities in urban areas will benefit those at risk.
Around half of the world’s population live in urban areas at present, and
by 2050, this figure is expected to rise to about 70% (UN, 2008). Cities
across the world are expected to absorb most of the population growth
over the next four decades, as well as continuing to attract migrants from
rural areas (UN, 2008). In the context of a heat-related extreme event,
certain infrastructural factors can either amplify or reduce vulnerability
of exposed populations. The built environment is important since local heat
production affects the urban thermal budget (from internal combustion
engines, air conditioners, and other activities). Other factors also play a
role in determining local temperatures, including surface reflectivity or
albedo, the percent of vegetative cover, and thermal conductivity of
building materials. The urban heat island effect, caused by increased
absorption of infrared radiation by buildings and pavement, lack of
shading, evapotranspiration by vegetation, and increased local heat
production, can significantly increase temperatures in the urban core by
several degrees Celsius, raising the likelihood of hazardous heat exposure
for urban residents (Clarke, 1972; Shimoda, 2003). Street canyons where
building surfaces absorb heat and affect air flow are also areas where
heat hazards may be more severe (Santamouris et al., 1999; Louka et
al., 2002). The restricted air flow within street canyons may also cause
accumulation of traffic-related air pollutants (Vardoulakis et al., 2003).

"Efforts to minimize the public health impact for the heat wave in 2003
were hampered by denial of the event's seriousness and the inability of
many institutions to instigate emergency-level responses (Lagadec,
2004). Afterwards several European countries quickly initiated plans to
prepare for future events (WHO, 2006b). France, the country hit hardest,
developed a national heat wave plan, surveillance activities, clinical
treatment guidelines for heat-related illness, identification of vulnerable
populations, infrastructure improvements, and home visiting plans for
future heat waves (Laaidi et al., 2004).

"Three years later, between 10 and 28 July 2006, Europe experienced
another major heat wave. In France, it ranked second only to the one in
2003 as the most severe heat wave since 1950 (Météo France, 2006;
Fouillet et al., 2008). The 2006 heat wave was longer in duration than
that of 2003, but was less intense and covered less geographical area
(Météo France, 2006). Ozone levels were high across much of southern and
northwestern Europe in July 2006, with concentrations reaching levels
only exceeded in 2003 to date (EEA, 2007). Across France, recorded
maximum temperatures soared to 39 to 40°C, while minimum recorded
temperatures reached 19 to 23°C (compared with 23 to 25°C in 2003)
(Météo France, 2006). Based on a historical model, the temperatures
were expected to cause around 6,452 excess deaths in France alone, yet
only around 2,065 excess deaths were recorded (Fouillet et al., 2008).

"The difference in impact between the heat waves in 2003 and 2006
may be at least partly attributed to the difference in the intensity and
geographic scope of the hazard. It has been considered that in France
at least, some decrease in 2006 mortality may also be attributed to
increased awareness of the ill effects of a heat wave, the preventive
measures instituted after the 2003 heat wave, and the heat health
watch system set up in 2004 (Fouillet et al., 2008). While the mortality
reduction may demonstrate the efficacy of public health measures, the
persistent excess mortality highlights the need for optimizing existing
public health measures such as warning and watch systems (Hajat et al.,

"During the first two weeks of August 2003, temperatures in Europe
soared far above historical norms. The heat wave stretched across much
of Western Europe, but France was particularly affected (InVS, 2003).
Maximum temperatures recorded in Paris remained mostly in the range
of 35 to 40°C between 4 and 12 August, while minimum temperatures
recorded by the same weather station remained almost continuously
above 23°C between 7 and 14 August (Météo France, 2003). The European
heat wave had significant health impacts (Lagadec, 2004). Initial estimates
were of costs exceeding €13 billion, with a death toll of over 30,000
across Europe (UNEP, 2004). It has been estimated that mortality over
the entire summer could have reached about 70,000 (Robine et al.,
2008) with approximately 14,800 excess deaths in France alone (Pirard
et al. 2005). The severity, duration, geographic scope, and impact of the
event were unprecedented in recorded European history (Grynszpan,
2003; Kosatsky, 2005; Fouillet et al., 2006) and put the event in the
exceptional company of the deadly Beijing heat wave of 1743, which killed
at least 11,000, and possibly many more (Levick, 1859; Bouchama,
2004; Lagadec, 2004; Pirard et al., 2005; Robine et al., 2008).

"Concentrations of air pollutants such as particulate matter and ozone are
often elevated during heat waves due to anticyclonic weather conditions,
increased temperatures, and light winds. Photochemical production of
ozone and emissions of biogenic ozone precursors increase during hot,
sunny weather, and light winds do little to disperse the build-up of air
pollution. Air pollution has well-established acute effects on health,
particularly associated with respiratory and cardiovascular illness, and can
result in increased mortality and morbidity (WHO, 2006a). Background
ozone levels in the Northern Hemisphere have doubled since preindustrial
times (Volz and Kley, 1988) and increased in many urban areas over the
last few decades (Vingarzan, 2004). Air quality standards and regulations
are helping to improve air quality, although particles and ozone are still
present in many areas at levels that may cause harm to human health,
particularly during heat waves (Royal Society, 2008; EEA, 2011). The effects
of climate change (particularly temperature increases) together with a
steady increase in background hemispheric ozone levels is reducing the
efficacy of measures to control ozone precursor emissions in the future
(Derwent et al., 2006). The increased frequency of heat waves in the
future will probably lead to more frequent air pollution episodes (Stott
et al., 2004; Jones et al., 2008).

level needs and experiences in order to be more successful. Greater

"As yet, there is not much evidence on the efficacy of heat warning
systems. A few studies have identified an effect of heat preparedness
programming. For example, the use of emergency medical services during
heat wave events dropped by 49% in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, between
1995 and 1999; an outcome that may be partly due to heat preparedness
programming or to differences between the two heat waves (Weisskopf
et al. 2002). Evidence has also indicated that interventions in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, are /ikely to have reduced mortality rates by 2.6 lives per
day during heat events (Ebi et al., 2004). An Italian intervention program
found that caretaking in the home resulted in decreased hospitalizations
due to heat (Marinacci et al., 2009). However, for all these studies, it is
not clear whether the observed reductions were due to the interventions.

"One particularly difficult aspect of heat preparedness is communicating
risk. In many locations populations are unaware of their risk and heat
wave warning systems go largely unheeded (Luber and McGeehin, 2008).
Some evidence has even shown that top-down educational messages
do not result in appropriate resultant actions (Semenza et al., 2008). The
receipt of information is not sufficient to generate new behaviors or the
development of new social norms. Even when information is distributed
through pamphlets and media outlets, behavior of at-risk populations
often does not change and those targeted by such interventions have
suggested that community-based organizations be involved in order to
build on existing capacity and provide assistance (Abrahamson et al.,
2008). Older people, in particular, engage better with prevention
campaigns that allow them to maintain independence and do not focus
on their age, as many heat warning programs do (Hughes et al., 2008).

"A common public health approach to reducing exposure is the Heat
Warning System (HWS) or Heat Action Response System. The four
components of the latter include an alert protocol, community response
plan, communication plan, and evaluation plan (Health Canada, 2010).
The HWS is represented by the multiple dimensions of the EuroHeat
plan, such as a lead agency to coordinate the alert, an alert system, an
information outreach plan, long-term infrastructural planning, and
preparedness actions for the health care system (WHO, 2007). The
European Network of Meteorological Services has created Meteoalarm
as a way to coordinate warnings and to differentiate them across
regions (Bartzokas et al., 2010). There are a range of approaches used
to trigger alerts and a range of response measures implemented once
an alert has been triggered. In some cases, departments of emergency
management lead the endeavor, while in others public health-related
agencies are most responsible (McCormick, 2010b).

"Assessing excess mortality is the most widely used means of assessing
the health impact of heat-related extreme events. Mortality represents
only the ‘tip of the iceberg’ of heat-related health effects; however, it is
more widely and accurately reported than morbidity, which explains its
appeal as a data source. Nonetheless, assessing heat mortality presents
particular challenges. Accurately assessing heat-related mortality faces
challenges of differences in contextual variations (Hémon and Jougla, 2004;
Poumadere et al., 2005), and coroner's categorization of deaths (Nixdorf-
Miller et al., 2006). For example, there are a number of estimates of
mortality for the European heat wave that vary depending on geographic
and temporal ranges, methodological approaches, and risks considered
(Assemblée Nationale, 2004). The different types of analyses used to
assess heat mortality, such as certified heat deaths and heat-related
mortality measured as an excess of total mortality over a given time
period, are important distinctions in assessing who is affected by the
heat (Kovats and Hajat, 2008). Learning from past and other countries’
experience, a common understanding of definitions of heat waves and
excess mortality, and the ability to streamline death certification in the
context of an extreme event could improve the ease and quality of
mortality reporting.

significant reductions in heat-related illness would result from land use
modifications that increase albedo, proportion of vegetative cover,

Silva et al. 2010). Reducing energy consumption in buildings can improve
resilience, since localized systems are less dependent on vulnerable
energy infrastructure. In addition, by better insulating residential
dwellings, people would suffer less effect from heat hazards. Financial
incentives have been tested in some countries as a means to increase
energy efficiency by supporting those who are insulating their homes.
Urban greening can also reduce temperatures, protecting local populations

"Wildfire risk occurs in many regions of the globe; however embodying this
risk in a single and practical universal index is difficult. The relationships
between weather and wildfires have been studied for many areas of the
world; in some, weather is the dominant factor in ignitions, while in
others, human activities are the major cause of ignition, but weather and
environmental factors mainly determine the area burned (Bradstock et al.,
2009). Wildfire behavior is also modified by forest and land management
and fire suppression (Allen et al., 2002; Noss et al., 2006). Wildfires do
not burn at random in the landscape (Nunes et al., 2005), and occur at
particular topographic locations or distances from towns or roads
(Mouillot et al., 2003; Badia-Perpinya and Pallares-Barbera, 2006;
Syphard et al., 2009). The intensity and rate of spread of a wildfire is
dependent on the amount, moisture content, and arrangement of fine
dead fuel, the wind speed near the burning zone, and the terrain and
slope where it is burning. Wildfire risk is a combination of all factors that
affect the inception, spread, and difficulty of fire control and damage

localities (Sections 3.3.1, 3.3.2, and 3.5.1). In general, an increase in
mean temperature, and a decrease in mean precipitation can contribute
to increased fire risk (Flannigan et al., 2009). When in combination with
severe droughts and heat waves, which are also expected to increase
in many fire regions (Sections 3.3.1 and 3.5.1), fires can become
catastrophic (Bradstock et al., 2009). Wildfires occur in many regions of
the world, and due to their extreme nature, authorities and the public in
general are acquainted with such extreme situations, and plans have
been enacted to mitigate them. However, at times, the nature of fire
challenges these plans and disasters emerge. This case study uses the
example from Victoria, Australia, in 2009. The goal is to present hot
weather and wildland fire hazards and their effects and potential
impacts, and to provide an overview of experience to learn to manage
these extreme risks, as well as key lessons for the future.

tend to occur from exacerbations of chronic medical conditions as well
as direct heat-related illness; this is particularly so for the frail and
elderly (Kovats and Hajat, 2008). However, excess mortality can provide
a measure of the impact of a heat wave. With respect to total all-cause
mortality, there were 374 excess deaths with a 62% increase in total
all-cause mortality. The total number of deaths during the four days of
the heat wave was 980, compared to a mean of 606 for the previous

"The United Nations (UN) estimates that a large number of the severely
affected population are living below the poverty line (US$ 1/person/day)
(UN, 2009). When combined with an increase in the price of food and basic
resources, this reduced income has resulted in negative consequences
for whole households (FAO, 2009). Many cannot afford basic supplies or
food, which has led to a reduction in their food intake, the selling of assets,
a rise in the rate of borrowing money, the degradation of land, urban
migration, and children leaving school (FAO, 2009; UN, 2009; Solh, 2010).
The UN assessment mission stated that the reasons for removing children
from school included financial hardship, increased costs of transport,
migration to cities, and the requirement for children to work to earn
extra income for families (UN, 2009). Consequently, due to poor food
consumption, the rates of malnutrition have risen between 2007 and 2008,
with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimating a doubling
of malnutrition cases among pregnant women and children under five
(FAO, 2008). Due to inadequate consumption of micro- and macronutrients
in the most-affected households, it has been estimated that the average
diet contains less than 15% of the recommended daily fat intake and
50% of the advised energy and protein requirements (UN, 2009).

"A combination of actions including food and agriculture assistance,
supplemented by water and health interventions, and measures aimed
at increasing drought resilience, were identified as required to allow
affected populations to remain in their villages and restart agricultural
production (UN, 2009). Ongoing interventions with the aim of reducing
vulnerability and increasing resilience to drought were summarized by
the UN Syrian Drought Response Plan (UN, 2009) and FAO (FAO, 2009).
These interventions were aimed at providing support through four main
approaches: (1) the rapid distribution of wheat, barley, and legume seeds
to 18,000 households in the affected areas, potentially assisting 144,000
people; (2) sustaining the remaining asset base of the approximately
20,000 herders by providing animal feed and limited sheep restocking
to approximately 1,000 herders; (3) the development of a drought early
warning system to facilitate the government taking early actions before
serious and significant losses occur and to develop this to ensure
sustainability; and (4) building capability to implement the national
drought strategy by developing and addressing all stages of the disaster
management cycle (FAO, 2009). Conservation agriculture (which has been
defined as no-tillage, direct drilling/seeding, and drilling/seeding through
a vegetative cover) is considered to be a way forward for sustainable
land use (Stewart et al., 2008; Lalani 2011). However, how to take this
forward has caused considerable debate (Stewart et al., 2008).

Mongolian term dzud denotes unusually extreme weather conditions
that result in the death of a significant number of livestock over large

of one-third of Mongolia’s total livestock (Batjargal et al., 2001). The
2009-2010 dzud caused similarly high animal mortality (NSO, 2011). The
large losses of animals in dzud events demonstrates that Mongolia as a
whole has low capacity to combat natural disaster (Batjargal et al.,

drought, heavy snowfall, extreme cold, and windstorms. It can last all year

"Dzud disasters occurred in 1999-2002 and 2009-2010, causing social and
economic impacts. These disasters occurred as a result of environmental
and human-induced factors. The environmental factors included drought
resulting in very limited pasture grass and hay with additional damage
to pasture by rodents and insects (Batjargal et al., 2001; Begzsuren et al.,
2004; Saizen et al., 2010). Human factors included budgetary issues for
preparedness in both government and households, inadequate pasture
management and coordination, and lack of experience of new and/or
young herders (Batjargal et al., 2001). Climatic factors contributing to
both dzuds were summer drought followed by extreme cold and snowfall
in winter. However the autumn of 1999-2000 brought heavy snowfall
and unusual warmth with ice cover, while the winter and spring of
2009-2010 also brought windstorms. Summer drought was a more
significant contributor to the 1999-2000 dzud (Batjargal et al., 2001),

one-third (approximately 12 million) of its livestock and Mongolia’s
national gross agricultural output in 2003 decreased by 40% compared
to that in 1999 (Mearns, 2004; Oyun, 2004; AIACC, 2006; Lise et al.,
2006; Saizen et al., 2010). It was reported that in 1998 there were an
estimated 190,000 herding households but as a result of the dzud,
11,000 families lost all their livestock (Lise et al., 2006). Thus the dzud
had severe impacts on the population and their livelihoods, including
unemployment, poverty, and negative health impacts (Batjargal et al.,

"At a local level: The National Climate Risk Management Strategy and
Action Plan (MMS, 2009) sets a goal of building climate resilience at the
community level through reducing risk and facilitating adaptation by: (i)
improving access to water through region-specific activities such as
rainwater harvesting and creation of water pools from precipitation and
flood waters, for use for animals, pastureland, and crop irrigation purposes;
(ii) improving the quality of livestock by introducing local selective
breeds with higher productivity and more resilient to climate impacts;
(iii) strengthened veterinarian services to reduce animal diseases and
parasites and cross-border epidemic infections; and (iv) using traditional
herding knowledge and techniques for adjusting animal types and herd
structure to make appropriate for the carrying capacity of the pastureland
and pastoral migration patterns. The formation of herders’ community
groups and establishment of pasture co-management teams (Ykhanbai et
al., 2004), along with better community-based disaster risk management,
could also facilitate effective DRR and CCA (Baigalmaa, 2010).

snowfall exceeding climatic means was recorded in October.
Moreover, a warming in November and December by 1.7 to 3.5°C

high density, reaching 0.37 g cnv3, and ice cover formation, both
of which blocked livestock pasturing.

monthly average air temperature was lower than climatic means
by 2 to 6°C. The cold condition persisted for two months. Abundant
snowfall resulted with 80% of the country’s territory being covered
in snow of 24 to 46 cm depth.

"Tropical cyclones, also called typhoons and hurricanes, are powerful
storms generated over tropical and subtropical waters. Their extremely
strong winds damage buildings, infrastructure and other assets; the
torrential rains often cause floods and landslides; and high waves and
storm surge often lead to extensive coastal flooding and erosion — all of
which have major impacts on people. Tropical cyclones are typically
classified in terms of their intensity, based on measurements or estimates
of near-surface wind speed (sometimes categorized on a scale of 1 to 5
according to the Saffir-Simpson scale). The strongest storms (Categories
3, 4, and 5) are comparatively rare but are generally responsible for the

(iii) research and technology to ensure the development of agriculture
that could successfully deal with various environmental problems; and
(iv) improved coordination of stakeholders’ activities based on research,
inventory, and monitoring findings (Dagvadorj et al., 2010). The
management of risk in the livestock sector requires a combination of
approaches. Traditional herding and pastoral risk reduction practices
can better prepare herders for moderate weather events. For country-
wide dzud events, however, high levels of livestock mortality are often
unavoidable, even for the most experienced herders, and pasture
resource and herd management must be complemented by risk-financing
mechanisms that provide herders with instant liquidity in the aftermath

safe areas, and local inhabitants and remaining tourists were taken to
shelters (Garcia et al., 2006). Before the hurricane hit the coast, heavy
machines and emergency groups were mobilized in the region, to
reestablish water, electricity, communications, and health services
immediately after the event. After the disaster, all ministries were
involved in reopening the airport and tourist facilities as quickly as
possible. By December, most hotels were operating, and the sand lost

system was adapted to the specific needs and skills of the people. The
village officials receive daily precipitation and water levels at strategic

the river reaches critical levels, this information is passed on by radio
and blue, yellow, or red flags are raised depending on the flood alert

occurred in Mozambique, but the country was prepared to a greater
extent than before. Between December 2006 and February 2007, heavy
rains across northern and central Mozambique together with a severe
downpour in neighboring countries led to flooding in the Zambezi River
basin (IFRC, 2007). Additional flooding was caused by the approach of
tropical cyclone Favio, which struck the Buzi area at the end of February
2007 (Poolman et al., 2008). During the flood period on the southern
coast of Mozambique, 29 people were killed, 285,000 people affected,
and approximately 140,000 displaced (Kienberger, 2007; World Bank,

and destroyed 277,000 ha of crops (USAID, 2007).

¢ Floods, as one of the most dangerous natural phenomena, are a
real threat to the sustainable development of nations (Ahern et al.,
2005; Guha-Sapir et al., 2011)

© The consequences of floods depend on the long-term adaptation
to extremes of climate, and associated hydrologic extremes require
further understanding. After the 2000 floods in Mozambique, national
and international organizations updated their strategies to include
disaster preparedness, risk management, and contingency and
response capacities according to the lessons of catastrophic floods.
The Government of Mozambique introduced new DRM structures
between 2000 and 2007, illustrating the flexibility needed to
accommodate the scientific and communication systems that need
to be in place to adapt to a climate change-driven disaster and that
this can be done in liaison with and with guidance from external
agencies. Realization of the new program of DRM led to a reduction
in consequences from the floods in 2007 (Republic of Mozambique,
2006a).

¢ Experience in Mozambique shows that creation and development
of effective and steadily functioning systems of hydrological
monitoring and early warning systems at a local, regional, and
national level as key components of DRM allowing more realistic
warnings of flooding threats (WMO, 201 1a).

¢ The implementation of resettlement programs in periodically flooded
areas in 2007 has reduced flood damage, but these measures are
not easy to implement (WMO, 201 1a).

Limited available resources are one of the most important problems
for both disaster preparedness and disaster response. The extreme
poverty of the people makes them highly vulnerable to floods and
other natural disasters, despite the best efforts of the government
to protect them (World Bank, 2011b).

© The example of Mozambique shows that climate change adaptation
needs to be achieved through the understanding of vulnerability in
all sectors (social, infrastructure, production, and environmental)
and this knowledge needs to be used for the formulation of
preparedness and response mechanisms (Sietz et al., 2008).

EI Nifio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which brings higher temperatures,
more intense precipitation, and enhanced cholera transmission. ENSO
has been associated with cholera outbreaks in coastal and inland
regions of Africa (Constantin de Magny et al., 2007), South Asia
(Constantin de Magny et al., 2007), and South America (Gil et al., 2004).
There is concern that climate change will work synergistically with
poverty and poor sanitation to increase cholera risk.

"Commonly, underdeveloped health and other infrastructure, poverty,
political instability, and ecosystem disruptions interact with weather to
impact health adversely, sometimes to a disastrous degree (Myers
and Patz, 2009). For example, cholera is an infectious disease that is
perpetuated by poverty and associated factors, though outbreaks are
commonly associated with rainy season onset. Research in the last
decade has demonstrated that cholera is also sensitive to climate
variability (Rod6 et al., 2002; Koelle et al., 2005a; Constantin de Magny
et al, 2007). Assuming persistence of these vulnerability factors, cholera
outbreaks may become more widespread as the climate continues to
change (Lipp et al., 2002) due to the projected /ikely increase in frequency
of heavy precipitation over many areas of the globe, and tropical
regions in particular (see Table 3-1). Insights into the diseases ecology,
however, including its climate sensitivity, may one day inform early warning
systems and other interventions that could blunt its disastrous impact.
Equally, if not more important, poverty reduction and improvements in
engineering, critical infrastructure, and political stability and transparency
can reduce vulnerability among exposed populations to the degree that
cholera could be contained.

"Cholera epidemics occur when susceptible human hosts are brought
into contact with toxigenic strains of V. cholerae serogroup 01 or
serogroup 0139. A host of ecological factors affect V. cholerae’s
environmental prevalence and pathogenicity (Colwell, 2002) and the
likelihood of human exposure (Koelle, 2009). In coastal regions, there is
a commensal relationship between V. cholerae, plankton, and algae
(Colwell, 1996). Cholera bacteria are attracted to the chitin of zooplankton
exoskeletons, which provide them with stability and protect them from
predators. The zooplankton feed on algae, which bloom in response to
increasing sunlight and warmer temperatures. When there are algal
blooms in the Bay of Bengal, the zooplankton prosper and cholera
populations grow, increasing the likelihood of human exposure.
Precipitation levels, sea surface temperature, salinity, and factors affecting
members of the marine and estuarine ecosystem, such as algae and
copepods, affect exposure probability (Huq et al., 2005). Many of these
factors appear to be similar across regions, although their relative
importance varies, such as the association of V. cholerae with chitin
(Pruzzo et al., 2008) and the importance of precipitation and sea level
(Emch et al., 2008). For example, marine and estuarine sources were the
source of pathogenic V. cholerae strains responsible for cholera epidemics
in Mexico in recent El Nifio years (Lizarraga-Partida et al., 2009).

"Zimbabwe has had cholera outbreaks every year since 1998, with the
2008 epidemic the worst the world had seen in two decades, affecting
approximately 92,000 people and killing over 4,000 (Mason, 2009). The
outbreak began on 20 August 2008, slightly lagging the onset of
seasonal rains, in Chitungwiza city, just south of the capital Harare
(WHO, 2008a). In the initial stages, several districts were affected. In
October, the epidemic exploded in Harare’s Budiriro suburb and soon
spread to include much of the country, persisting well into June 2009
and ultimately seeding outbreaks in several other countries. Weather
appears to have been crucial in the outbreak, as recurrent point-source
contamination of drinking water sources (WHO, 2008a) was almost
certainly amplified by the onset of the rainy season (Luque Fernandez et
al., 2009). In addition to its size, this epidemic was distinguished by its
urban focus and relatively high case fatality rate (CFR; the proportion of
infected people who die) ranging from 4 to 5% (Mason, 2009). Most
outbreaks have CFRs below 1% (Alajo et al., 2006). Underlying structural
vulnerability with shortages of medicines, equipment, and staff at
health facilities throughout the country compounded the effects of the

"Enhanced understanding of cholera ecology has enabled development
of predictive models that perform relatively well (Matsuda et al., 2008)

trends in sea surface temperature, algal growth, and other ecological
drivers of cholera risk can help reduce risks of epidemic disease,
particularly in coastal regions (Mendelsohn and Dawson, 2008).
Strategies to reduce physiologic susceptibility through vaccination have
shown promise (Calain et al., 2004; Chaignat et al., 2008; Lopez et al.,
2008; Sur et al., 2009) and mass vaccination campaigns have potential
to interrupt epidemics (WHO, 2006c), and may be cost effective in
resource-poor regions or for displaced populations where provision of
sanitation and other services has proven difficult (Jeuland and
Whittington, 2009). Current World Health Organization policy on cholera
vaccination holds that vaccination should be used in conjunction with
other control strategies in endemic areas and be considered for
populations at risk for epidemic disease, and that cholera immunization
is a temporizing measure while more permanent sanitation improvements
can be pursued (WHO, 2010). Ultimately, given the strong association
with poverty, continued focus on development may ultimately have the
largest impact on reducing cholera risk.

"There are multiple opportunities for learning to enhance risk management
related to epidemic disease. First, while reactive containment processes
can be essential for identifying and containing outbreaks, this approach
often glosses over root causes in an effort to return to the status quo.
As the World Health Organization states, “Current responses to cholera
outbreaks are reactive, taking the form of a more or less well-organized
emergency response,” and prevention is lacking (WHO, 2006c). Without
losing the focus on containment, institutional learning could incorporate
strategies to address root causes, reducing the likelihood of future
outbreaks. This includes continued efforts to better understand cholera’s
human ecology to explore deeper assumptions, structures, and policy
decisions that shape how risks are constructed. In the case of cholera,
such exploration has opened the possibility of devising warning systems
and other novel risk management strategies. Another equally important
conclusion — one that experts on climate's role in driving cholera risk
have emphasized (Pascual et al., 2002) — is that poverty and political
instability are the fundamental drivers of cholera risk, and that emphasis
on development and justice are risk management interventions as well.

"WOrk Inciude:

Variability in precipitation and temperature can affect important
epidemic diseases such as cholera both through direct effects on
the transmission cycle, but also potentially through indirect effects,
for example through problems arising from inadequate basic water
and sanitation services.

If other determinants remained constant, climate change would be
expected to increase risk by increasing exposure likelihood —
through increased variability in precipitation and gradually rising
temperatures and by increasing population vulnerability.

The health impacts of cholera epidemics are strongly mediated
through individual characteristics such as age and immunity, and
population-level social determinants, such as poverty, governance,
and infrastructure.

Experience from multiple cholera epidemics demonstrates that
non-climatic factors can either exacerbate or override the effects of
weather or other infection hazards.

The processes of DRM and preventive public health are closely
linked, and largely synonymous. Strengthening and integrating
these measures, alongside economic development, should increase
resilience against the health effects of extreme weather and gradual
climate change.

Guangzhou, Ho Chi Minh City, Shanghai, Bangkok, Rangoon, Miami, and
Hai Phong. Many of these cities are already characterized by significant
population and asset exposure to coastal flooding, and all but Miami
are located in developing countries in Asia.

"Mumbai is one of many coastal megacities that have been built in part
on reclaimed land, a process that increases flood risks to low-lying
areas where slums are frequently located (Chatterjee, 2010). Its slums
do not benefit from structural flood protection measures and are located
in low-lying areas close to marshes and other marginal places and
are frequently flooded during monsoon season, especially when heavy
rainfall occurs during high tides (McGranahan et al., 2007; Chatterjee,
2010). A rise in sea level of 50 cm, together with storm surges, would
render uninhabitable the coastal and low-lying areas (De Sherbinin et
al., 2007) where many of Mumbai's informal settlements are currently
located.

"However, there is a certain limit to adaptation given that these cities are
fixed in place and some degree of exposure to hazards is ‘locked in’ due
to the unlikelihood of relocation (Hanson et al., 2011). For example, India’s
large infrastructure investments, which have facilitated Mumbai's rapid
growth, were built to last 50 to 150 years (Revi, 2008). This forecloses
some adaptation and DRR strategies, such as risk avoidance.
Furthermore, all large coastal cities are centers of high population
density, infrastructure, investments, networking, and information
(McGranahan et al., 2007; Chatterjee, 2010). This concentration and
connectivity make them important sources of innovation and economic
growth, especially in developing countries where these ingredients may
be absent elsewhere. This underscores the importance of governance
and economic relations, including insurance and more general basic
needs of health and education, in allowing urban systems and those at
risk to build resilience if they cannot avoid hazard.

adaptation may be needed to safeguard the residents and economic

New York or Tokyo. Two critical distinctions are the degree of poverty

analysis of the economic impacts of climate change at this scale has

understanding of climate risks and the limited institutional capacity
have meant that analysis of climate change impacts at the city scale has
generally considered only flood risks and not yet assessed additional
potential impacts (Hunt and Watkiss, 2011). A standardized, multi-

responding to disasters (TDB, 2007). SIDS share similar development
challenges including small but growing populations, economic
dependence on international funders, and lack of resources (eg.,
freshwater, land) (World Bank, 2005b; UNFCCC, 2007a). The IPCC

with high levels of poverty and are reported to suffer serious
environmental degradation and to have weak human and institutional
capacities for land management that is integrated and sustainable (GEF,
2006). The range of physical resources available to states influences their
options to cope with disasters and the relatively restricted economic
diversity intrinsic to SIDS minimizes their capacity to respond in
emergencies with measures such as shelter or evacuation (Boruff and
Cutter, 2007). Hence SIDS are among the most vulnerable states to the
impacts of climate change (UNFCCC, 2007b). As of 2010, 38 UN member

the country's forecasted growth rate from 5.7% to -1.4% (Quarless,

"Many SIDS face specific disadvantages associated with their small size,
insularity, remoteness, and susceptibility to natural hazards. SIDS are
particularly vulnerable to climate change because their key economic
sectors such as agriculture, fisheries, and tourism are all susceptible

provided in Chapter 4, especially Sections 4.2.1, 4.4.4, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3).
The hazards of extreme weather events are coupled with other long-
term climate change impacts, especially sea level rise (see Box 3-4).
Low-lying atoll communities, such as the Maldives and Cook Islands, are
especially vulnerable (Ebi et al, 2006; Woodroffe, 2008; Kelman and
West, 2009) and are expected to lose significant portions of land
(Mimura et al., 2007). Small island states and particularly atoll countries
may experience erosion, inundation, and saline intrusion resulting in
ecosystem disruption, decreased agricultural productivity, changes in
disease patterns, economic losses, and population displacement — all of
which reinforce vulnerability to extreme weather events (Pernetta,
1992; Nurse and Sem, 2001; Mimura et al., 2007).

"Freshwater availability is a major concern for many SIDS (Quarless,
2007), including the RMI. Since SIDS are especially vulnerable to
extreme weather events, their water supplies face rapid salinization due
to seawater intrusion and contamination (PSIDS, 2009). According to
one study, countries such as the RMI lack the financial and technical
resources to implement seawater desalination for their populations
(UNDESA, 2011). Some disaster and climate risk management gains
may come from simple technology (UNDESA, 2010). New scavenger
technology for wells has been introduced (UNESC, 2004) as one of the
ways forward. Simple abstraction of freshwater from thin groundwater
lenses (a typical practice in oceanic atolls) often results in upward coning
of saltwater, which, in turn, causes contamination of the water supplies.
The RMI has benefited from its use of new, pioneering technology to
limit the effects of extreme weather events on its water supply (UNDESA,
2011). The improvement of climate sensitivity knowledge, particularly in
the context of risk management, is key to adaptation to climate change.
Climate and disaster risk are closely entwined and, for example,
resilience to drought and resilience to climate change both stand to be
enhanced through a single targeted program.

"The impacts of permafrost thaw on infrastructure have implications for
the health, economic livelihood, and safety of northern Canadian
communities. The costs of repairing and installing technologies to adapt
to climate change in existing infrastructure can range from several
million to many billions of dollars, depending on the extent of the
damage and the type of infrastructure that is at risk (Infrastructure

permafrost damage to highways, Alaska is experiencing costs of up to
CDN$ 30,000 km yr? for an annual cost of over CDN$ 6 million over

"Permafrost thaw is one of the leading factors increasing climate-related
vulnerability. Permafrost is by definition dependent on a sub-zero
temperature to maintain its state (CSA, 2010; NRCAN, 2011a). With a
changing climate, it is difficult to predict where permafrost is most likely
to thaw, but about half of Canada’s permafrost zones are sensitive to
small, short-term increases in temperature, compromising the ability of
the ground to support infrastructure (Nielson, 2007; NRTEE, 2009; CSA,
2010). The rate of thaw (and hence implications for infrastructure stability)
is also dependent on soil type within the permafrost zone (Nielson,
2007). Areas that have ice-rich soil are much more likely to be affected
than those with a lower ice-soil ratio or those that are underlain by
bedrock (Nelson et al., 2002). Municipalities in discontinuous or sporadic
permafrost zones may feel the impacts of a warming climate more
intensely since the permafrost is thinner than it would be in continuous
zones where ice has built up over time (Nelson et al., 2002).

"Early warning systems are to alert and inform citizens and governments
of changes on time scales of minutes to hours for immediate threats
requiring urgent evasive action; weeks for more advanced preparedness;
and seasons and decades for climate variations and changes (Brunet et
al., 2010). To date most early warning systems have been based on
weather predictions, which provide short-term warnings often with
sufficient lead time and accuracy to take evasive action. However, the
range of actions that can be taken is limited. Weather predictions often
provide less than 24 hours notice of an impending extreme weather
event and options in resource-poor areas may not extend beyond the
emergency evacuations of people (Chapter 5). Thus although lives may
be saved, livelihoods can be destroyed, especially those of the poorest
communities.

reductions in deaths, injuries, and livelihood losses over the last 30 years

"With the rapid growth in the number of humanitarian disasters, the
disaster risk management community has become attentive to changes
in extreme events possibly attributed to climate change including
floods, droughts, heat waves, and storms that cause the most frequent
and economically damaging disasters (Gall et al., 2009; Munich Re,
2010; Vos et al., 2010). Early warning systems provide an adaptation
option to minimize damaging impacts resulting from projected severe
events. Such systems also provide a mechanism to increase public
knowledge and awareness of natural risks and may foster improved
policy- and decisionmaking at various levels.

"Despite an inevitable focus on shorter-term survival and hence interest
in shorter-term hazard warnings, the longer time scales cannot be
ignored if reliable predictions are to be made. Changing greenhouse gas
concentrations are important even for seasonal forecasting, because
including realistic greenhouse gas concentrations can significantly
improve forecast skill (Doblas-Reyes et al., 2006; Liniger et al., 2007).
Similarly, adaptation tools traditionally based on long-term records
(e.g., stream flow measurements over 50 to 100 years) coupled with the
assumption that the climate is not changing may lead to incorrect
conclusions about the best adaptation strategy to follow (Milly et al.,
2008). Thus reliable prediction and successful adaptation both need a
perspective that includes consideration of short to long time scales
(days to decades).

"Important developments in recent years in the area of sub-seasonal and
seasonal-to-interannual prediction have led to significant improvements
in predictions of weather and climate extremes (Nicholls, 2001; Simmons
and Hollingsworth, 2002; Kharin and Zwiers, 2003; Medina-Cetina and
Nadim, 2008). Some of these improvements, such as the use of soil
moisture initialization for weather and (sub-) seasonal prediction (Koster
et al., 2010), have potential for applications in transitional zones between
wet and dry climates, and in particular in mid-latitudes (Koster et al.,
2004). Such applications may potentially be relevant for projections of
temperature extremes and droughts (Lawrimore et al., 2007; Schubert
et al., 2008; Koster et al., 2010). Decadal and longer time scale predictions
are improving and could form the basis for early warning systems in the
future (Meehl et al., 2007, 2009; Palmer et al., 2008; Shukla et al., 2009,
2010).

"Developing resiliency to weather and climate involves developing
resiliency to its variability on a continuum of time scales, and in an ideal
world, early warnings would be available across this continuum (Chapters
1 and 2; McBean, 2000; Hellmuth et al., 2011). However, investments in
developing such resiliency are usually primarily informed by information
only over the expected lifetime of the investment, especially among
poorer communities. For the decision of which crops to grow next season,
some consideration may be given to longer-term strategies but the
more pressing concern is likely to be the expected climate over the next
season. Indeed, there is little point in preparing to survive the impacts of
possible disasters a century in the future if one is not equipped to survive
more immediate threats. Thus, within the disaster risk management
community, preparedness for climate change must involve preparedness
for climate variability (Chapters 3 and 4).
"	Text
"While there are potential benefits of early warning systems (NRC, 2003;
Shapiro et al., 2007) that span a continuum of time scales, for much of
the disaster risk management community the idea of preparedness
based on predictions is a new concept. Most communities have largely
operated in a reactive mode, either to disasters that have already occurred
or in emergency preparedness for an imminent disaster predicted with
high confidence (Chapter 5). The possibility of using weather and climate
predictions longer than a few days to provide advanced warning of
extreme conditions has only been a recent development (Brunet et al.,
2010; Shapiro et al, 2010). Despite over a decade of operational seasonal
predictions in many parts of the globe, examples of the use of such
information by the disaster risk management community are scarce, due
to the uncertainty of predictions and comprehension of their implications
(Patt et al. 2005; Meinke et al. 2006; Hansen et al., 2011). Most
seasonal rainfall predictions, for example, are presented as probabilities
that total rainfall over the coming few (typically three) months will be
amongst the highest or lowest third of rainfall totals as measured over
a historical period and these are averaged over large areas (typically
tens of thousands of square kilometers). Not only are the probabilities
lacking in precision but the target variable — seasonal rainfall total —
does not necessarily map well onto flood occurrence. Although higher-
than-normal seasonal rainfall will often be associated with a higher risk
of floods, it is possible for the seasonal rainfall total to be unusually
high yet no flooding occurs. Alternatively, the total may be unusually
low, yet flooding might occur because of the occurrence of an isolated
heavy rainfall event (Chapter 3). Thus even when seasonal predictions
are understood properly, it may not be obvious how to utilize them.
These problems emphasize the need for the development of tools to
translate such information into quantities directly relevant to end users.
Better communication between modeling centers and end users is
needed (Chapters 5 and 6). Where targeted applications have been

"A legal framework establishes legal authority for programs and
organizations that relate to hazards, risk, and risk management. These
laws may dictate — or encourage — policies, practices, processes, the
assignment of authorities and responsibilities to individuals and/or

coordination or collaborative action among institutions (Mattingly, 2002).
Law can be used to provide penalties and incentives by enforcing
standards, to empower existing agencies or establish new bodies with
new responsibilities, and to assign budget lines (Pelling and Holloway,
2006). In short, legislation enables and promotes sustainable engagement,
helps to avoid disjointed action at various levels, and provides recourse

metropolitan Melbourne and is undertaking similar work for regional
Victoria (see Case Study 9.2.2). A Storm Warning Center and associated
coastal volunteer network has been established in Bangladesh and has
been proven effective (Case Study 9.2.5). The absence of a storm warning

"Early warning systems for extreme weather- or climate-related events,
such as heat waves, floods, and storms have been implemented to

demonstrating benefits for drought, floods, and other phenomena, and
decadal forecasts of increased numbers of intense precipitation events
and heat waves are now being factored into planning decisions (NRC,
2003; Lazo et al., 2009; Goddard et al., 2010). It is expected that early
warning systems will enable the implementation of DRR and CCA. Early
warning systems rely on the ability of people to factor information on the
future into plans and strategies and need to be coupled with education
programs, legislative initiatives, and scientific demonstrations of the
skill and cost value benefits of these systems.

DRR into development planning, and requires stakeholder inclusiveness.

"There have been examples of major benefits of early warning systems
(Einstein and Sousa, 2007). Assessments of community capacity to
respond to cyclone warnings have been performed for India (Sharma et
al., 2009), Florida (Smith and McCarty, 2009), New Orleans (Burnside et
al., 2007), New South Wales, Australia (Cretikos et al., 2008), and China
(Wang et al., 2008). Predictions of landfall for tropical cyclones are
important (Davis et al., 2008). In Bangladesh (Case Study 9.2.5; Paul,
2009), the implementation of an early warning system enabled people
to evacuate a hazardous area promptly (Paul and Dutt, 2010; Stein et
al., 2010). If forecasts are frequently incorrect, the response of people is
affected (Chapter 5; Dow and Cutter, 1998). Public health impacts of
hazards also depend on the preparedness of the local community (Vogt
and Sapir, 2009) and this can be improved by early warnings. However,
accurate predictions alone are insufficient for a successful early warning
system, as is demonstrated by the case in the United Kingdom — a country
that regularly experiences flooding (Parker et al., 2009). Severe damage
and health problems followed flooding in 2007 due to insufficiently clear
warning communication, issued too late and inadequately coordinated,
so that people, local government, and support services were unprepared
(UNISDR, 2009c). Heat-health warnings (Case Study 9.2.1) have proved
more effective (Fouillet et al., 2008; Hajat et al., 2010; Michelozzi et al.,
2010; Rubio et al., 2010) although improvements are still needed

administrative deliberations. These documents are noteworthy for their
consultative approach and their emphasis on disaster risk reduction

recovery and rehabilitation activities. Reasons for the lack of funding
include a lack of clarity of the Act on funding sources and confusion
regarding the processes to access various sources of funding (Visser and
Van Niekerk, 2009). Although the mechanisms to obtain funding exist,
not all municipalities and provinces are using them, hence the perception
of inadequate funding persists (Van Niekerk, 2011). In some cases there
appears to be an absolute lack of funds, such as in district municipalities,
which are more rural and less densely populated, and have a narrower
tax base to fund DRR (Van Riet and Diedericks, 2010). This situation is
similar to that in other countries, such as Colombia, where more than
80% of municipalities are able to assign only 20% of their own non-
earmarked resources to risk reduction and disaster response. Because
the law does not stipulate percentages and amounts, municipalities
allocate minimal sums for disaster risk reduction (MU, 2009) given
competing infrastructure and social spending needs (Cardona and
Yamin, 2007).

"Another method for hastening the legislative process would be to first
assess the adequacy of existing disaster risk reduction legislation and
strengthen these laws rather than starting a wholly new drafting and
negotiations process for adaptation that may create a parallel legal and
operational system (Llosa and Zodrow, 2011). As frequently reported
(e.g., UNDP, 2007; UNISDR, 2009c), an overload of laws and regulations

catastrophe risk in developing countries (see also Sections 5.5.2, 6.5.3,
and 7.4.4). Table 9-3 provides an overview of financial instruments and
arrangements, including risk transfer, as they are employed by households,
farmers, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and governments,
as well as international organizations and donors. Typically, losses are
reimbursed on an ad hoc basis after disasters strike through appeals to
solidarity, for example, from neighbors, governments, and international
donors. Households and other agents also rely on savings and credit,
and many governments set aside national or sub-national level reserve
funds. Alternatively, agents can engage in risk transfer (the shaded cells

"The human and economic toll from disasters can be greatly amplified by
the long-term loss in incomes, health, education, and other forms of
capital resulting from the inability of communities to restore infrastructure,
housing, sanitary conditions, and livelihoods in a timely way (Mechler,
2004; Mills, 2005). By providing timely financial assistance following
extreme event shocks, insurance and other risk-transfer instruments
contribute to DRR by reducing the medium- and long-term consequences
of disasters. These instruments are widespread in developed countries,
and are gradually becoming part of disaster management in developing
countries, where novel micro-insurance programs are helping to put
cash into the hands of affected poor households so they can begin
rebuilding livelihoods (Bhatt et al., 2010). These mechanisms can also
contribute to reducing vulnerability and advancing development even
before disasters strike by providing the requisite security for farmers and
firms to undertake higher-return, yet more risky investments in the face
of pervasive risk. Governments also engage in risk transfer. Investors
can be encouraged to invest in a country if there is evidence that the
government has reduced its risks (Gurenko, 2004).
"	Text
"An additional element is the need for periodic assessment and revision
to ensure that legislation for disaster risk reduction and adaptation is
dynamic and relevant (Llosa and Zodrow, 2011). For instance, the
Philippines’ Disaster Risk Reduction Management (DRRM) Act calls for
the development of a framework to guide disaster risk reduction and
management efforts to be reviewed “on a five-year interval, or as may
be deemed necessary, in order to ensure its relevance to the times”
(Republic of the Philippines, 2010). The DRRM Act also calls for the
development of assessments on hazards and risks brought about by
climate change (Republic of the Philippines, 2010). Likewise, the
Philippines Climate Change Act calls for the framework strategy that wil
guide climate change planning, research and development, extension,
and monitoring of activities to be reviewed every three years or as
necessary (Republic of the Philippines, 2009). Similarly, the Unitec
Kingdom's Climate Change Act establishes the preparation of a report
informing parliament on risks of current and predicted impact of climate
change no later than five years after the previous report (United
Kingdom, 2008). Thus an additional element for effective DRR-adaptation
legislation may be that the law be based on up-to-date risk assessment
and mandates periodic reassessment as risks evolve and knowledge of
climate change impacts improves.

benefits provided to that other party” (UNISDR, 2009b). Risk sharing
can be considered synonymous with risk transfer, although the latter is
often used to connote more informal forms of shifting risk without
explicit compensation or payment, for example, mutual non-market
arrangements among family or community. Insurance is the best known
form of market risk transfer; yet, risks can be transferred with many
formal and informal instruments as described in the following section.

"Traditional channels for financing disaster relief and recovery, although
in many cases less costly than risk transfer, have in the past proved to
be inadequate for managing large-scale weather-related events in highly
vulnerable countries (Cohen and Sebstad, 2003; Cardenas et al., 2007;
Barnett et al., 2008). In poor countries, households and businesses usually
do not have the resources to purchase commercial insurance to cover
their risks with the additional difficulty that in many developing countries
the commercial insurance providers do not exist. If there is no support
from family or government, disasters can lead to a worsening of poverty
in the absence of insurance. The victims then must either obtain high-
interest loans (or default on existing loans), sell their important and valued
assets and livestock, or engage in low-risk, low-yield farming to lessen
their exposure to extreme events (Varangis et al., 2002). In recognition of
these issues and to reduce the overall costs of disasters, investments in
disaster risk reduction and proactive risk transfer are strongly encouraged
by governments, the insurance sector, and the donor community (Kreimer
and Arnold, 2000; Gurenko, 2004; Linnerooth-Bayer et al, 2005).

"¢ Insurance is a “well-known form of risk transfer, where coverage of
a risk is obtained from an insurer in exchange for ongoing premiums
paid to the insurer” (UNISDR, 2009b). A contractual transaction
based on a premium is used to guarantee financial protection
against potentially large loss; contracts typically cover losses to
property, productive assets, commercial facilities, crops and
livestock, public infrastructure (sovereign insurance), and business
interruption.

¢ Micro-insurance, based on the same principles as insurance, is
aimed, most often, at lower-income individuals who cannot afford
traditional insurance and hence the premiums are lower but also
the coverage may be restricted. In some cases, the individuals are
unable to access more traditional insurance (Mechler et al., 2006).
Often it is provided in innovative partnerships involving
communities, NGOs, self-help groups, rural development banks,
insurers, government authorities, and donors.

¢ Alternative risk transfer denotes a range of arrangements that
hedge risk (Mechler et al., 2006). These include catastrophe bonds,
which are instruments where the investor receives an above-
market return when a pre-specified catastrophe does not occur
within a specified time interval. However, the investor sacrifices
interest or part of the principal following the event.

¢ Weather derivatives typically take the form of a parametric
(indexed-based) transaction, where payment is made if a chosen
weather index, such as 5-day rainfall amounts, exceeds some
predetermined threshold.

© Contingent credit (also called deferred drawdown option) is a
prearranged loan contingent on a specified event; it can be provided
by the insurance industry to other insurers, or by international
financial institutions to governments.

individual risk holders to spread their risk geographically.

irrigated crops in the state of Andhra Pradesh against the risk of
insufficient rainfall during key times during the cropping season. The
index-based policies are offered by a commercial insurer and marketed
to growers through microfinance banks. In contrast to conventional
insurance, which is written against actual losses, this index-based
(parametric) insurance is written against a physical or economic trigger,
in this case rainfall measured by a local rain gauge. The scheme owes its
existence to technical assistance provided by the World Bank (Hess and
Syroka, 2005). Schemes replicating this approach are currently targeting
700,000 exposed farmers in India (Cummins and Mahul, 2009).

"provided by the false perception of security when purchasing insurance
coverage. Second, an insurance contract renders high-risk farmers more
creditworthy, which enables them to access loans for agricultural inputs.
This was illustrated in the pilot program in Malawi, where farmers
purchased index-based drought insurance linked to loans to cover costs
of hybrid seed, with the result that their productivity was doubled
(Linnerooth-Bayer et al., 2009). Increased productivity decreases
vulnerability to weather extremes, thus contributing to climate change
adaptation (to the extent that risks of weather extremes are increased
by climate change). In another innovative micro-insurance project in
Ethiopia, farmers can pay their premiums by providing labor on risk-
reducing projects (Suarez and Linnerooth-Bayer, 2010).

"One advantage of index-based insurance is the substantial decrease in
transaction costs due to eliminating the need for expensive post-event
claims handling, which has impeded the development of insurance
mechanisms in developing countries (Varangis et al., 2002). A disadvantage
is basis risk, which is the lack of correlation of the trigger with the loss
incurred. If the rainfall measured at the weather station is sufficient, but
for isolated farmers insufficient, they will not receive compensation for
crop losses. Similar schemes are implemented or underway, for instance,
in Malawi, Ukraine, Peru, Thailand, and Ethiopia (Hellmuth et al., 2009). A
blueprint for insuring farmers in developing countries who face threats to
their livelihoods from adverse weather has been developed (World Bank,
2005d). Overcoming major institutional and other barriers must be done
in order for these programs to achieve this target (Hellmuth et al., 2009).

"Micro-insurance to cover, for example, life and health is widespread in
developing countries, but applications for catastrophic risks to crops
and property are in the beginning phases (see Morelli et al., 2010 for a
review, and Loster and Reinhard, 2010 for a focus on micro-insurance
and climate change). Typically a micro-insurance company, often
operating on a not-for-profit basis, evolves from an organization that
has developed insurance products for a community. Most are based on
the expectation that the pool of participants will provide payments that
cover the costs incurred, including expected damage claims (which are
generally low because of infrequent and small claims), administrative
costs (which are reduced through group contracts or linking contracts
to loans), taxes, and regulatory fees. Many depend on the support of
government subsidies and international development organizations and
participation of NGOs (Mechler et al., 2006).

"The World Food Programme (WFP), to supplement and partly replace its
traditional food-aid approach to famine, has recently supported the
Ethiopian government-sponsored Productive Safety Net Programme
(PSNP). The WFP is now insuring it against extreme drought (World Bank,
2006b). When there is a food emergency, the PSNP is able to provide
immediate cash payments that may be sufficient to save lives even in
the case of very severe droughts (Hess et al., 2006). However, these
payments may not be sufficient to restore livelihoods (World Bank, 2006b).
To provide extra capital in the case of extreme drought, an index-based
contract, sometimes referred to as a weather derivative, was designed
by the WFP. The amount of capital is based on contractually specified
catastrophic shortfalls in precipitation based on the Ethiopia Drought
Index (EDI). The EDI depends on rainfall amounts that were measured at
26 weather stations that represent the various agricultural areas of
Ethiopia. In 2006, the WFP successfully obtained an insurance contract
based on the EDI through an international reinsurer (Hess et al., 2006).
A drawback of this arrangement, in contrast to the micro-insurance
programs in India and Malawi, is that it perpetuates dependence on
post-drought government assistance with accompanying moral hazard.

"There are a range of risk-transfer instruments, where insurance is the
most common. With support from the international community, risk
transfer is becoming a reality in developing countries at the local,
national, and international scales, but the future is still uncertain. Index-
based contracts greatly reduce transaction costs and moral hazard
(medium confidence); while more costly than many traditional financing
measures, insurance has benefits both before disasters (by enabling
productive investment) and after disasters (by enabling reconstruction

"As these examples illustrate, risk-transfer instruments and especially
insurance can promote disaster risk reduction and climate change
adaptation by enabling recovery and productive activities. By providing
means to finance relief, recovery of livelihoods, and reconstruction,
insurance reduces long-term indirect losses — even human losses — that
do not show up in the disaster statistics. Risk transfer arrangements
thus directly lead to the reduction of post-event losses from extreme
weather events, what is commonly viewed as adaptation. Moreover,
insured households and businesses can plan with more certainty, and
because of the safety net provided by insurance, they can take on cost-
effective, yet risky, investments. This ultimately reduces vulnerability
to weather extremes and by so doing contributes to climate change
adaptation.

"been effective in discouraging construction in high-risk areas; for
example, UK insurers price flood policies according to risk zones,
but insurers are reluctant to award premium discounts for other
types of mitigation measures, such as reinforcing windows and
doors to protect against hurricanes (Kunreuther and Roth, 1998;
Kunreuther and Michel-Kerjan, 2009). The incentive effect of
actuarial risk pricing should be weighed against the benefits of
increasing insurance penetration to those unable to afford risk-
based premiums. The positive incentives provided by insurance
should also not overshadow the potential for negative incentives
or moral hazard.

Insurers and other providers can make risk reduction a contractual
stipulation, for example, by requiring fire safety measures as a
condition for insuring a home or business (Surminski, 2010). The US
National Flood Insurance Program requires communities to reduce
risks as a condition for offering subsidized policies to their residents
(Kunreuther and Roth, 1998; Linnerooth-Bayer et al., 2007). It was
noted above that the WFP might require risk-reducing activities as
a condition for its support for weather derivatives.

Providers can partner with government and communities to
establish appropriate regulatory frameworks and promote, for
instance, land use planning, building codes, emergency response,
and other types of risk-reducing policies. Ungern-Sternberg (2003)
has shown that Swiss cantons having public monopolies that provide
disaster insurance outperform cantons with private systems in
reducing risks and premiums, mainly because the public monopolies
have better access to land use planning institutions, fire departments,
and other public authorities engaged in risk reduction. In many
countries, insurers have co-financed research institutes and disaster
management centers, and in other cases, have partnered with
government to achieve changes in the planning system and
investment in public protection measures (Surminski, 2010).

resistance to incorporate yet another topic into overburdened curricula.
To enlist teachers’ cooperation, developing a partnership with the
ministry of education and school principals can be helpful (UNISDR,
2007b; World Bank et al., 2009). The following program in Indonesia
and the evaluation results from Nepal demonstrate the importance of
engaging teachers for effective education. The subsequent example from
Nepal, Pakistan, and India focuses on training builders through extensive
hands-on components in which new techniques are demonstrated and
participants practice these techniques under expert guidance (World

"In Nepal, Kyoto University researchers evaluated the knowledge and
perceptions of 130 teachers in 40 schools, most of whom were imparting
disaster education (Shiwaku et al., 2006). Through responses to a survey,
the researchers found that the content of the disaster risk education
being imparted depended on the awareness of individual teachers.
Teachers focused lessons on the effects of disasters with which they
could relate from personal experience. The researchers concluded that
teacher training is the most important step to improve disaster risk
education in Nepal. Most social studies teachers reported a need for
teacher training but the survey analysis recommended that training
programs be designed to integrate DRR into any subject rather than
taught in special classes (Shiwaku et al., 2006).

"Between 2007 and 2009, the Brazilian Santa Catarina State Civil
Defence Department, with the support of the Executive Secretariat and
the state university, undertook a public awareness initiative to reduce
social vulnerability to disasters induced by natural phenomena and
human action (SCSCDD, 2008a,b). During the two-year initiative, 2,000
educational kits were distributed free of charge to 1,324 primary
schools. Students also participated in a competition of drawings and
slogans that were made into a 2010 calendar. As the project's goal was
public awareness of risk, the project jointly launched a communications
network in partnership with media and social networks to promote better
dissemination of risk and disasters (SCSCDD, 2008a,b). The initiative
also focused on the most vulnerable populations. A pilot project for 16
communities precariously perched on a hill prone to landslides featured
a 44-hour course on risk reduction. Community participants elaborated
risk maps and reduction strategies, which they had to put to use
immediately. Shortly into the course, heavy rains battered the state,

"The Disaster Awareness in Primary Schools project, which provides
teacher training, was launched in Indonesia in 2005 with German support
and is ongoing. By 2007, through this project, 2,200 school teachers had
received DRR training. Project implementers found that existing teaching
methods were not conducive to active learning. Students listened to
teacher presentations, recited facts committed to memory, and were not
encouraged to understand concepts and processes. The training took
teachers’ capabilities into account by emphasizing the importance of
clarity and perseverance in delivering lessons so as to avoid passing on
faulty life-threatening information (e.g., regarding evacuation routes).
Scientific language was avoided and visual aids and activities encouraged.
Teachers were asked to take careful notes and to participate in practical
activities such as first-aid courses, thus modeling proactive learning.
Continuity with the teachers’ traditional teaching methods was
maintained by writing training modules in narrative form and following
the established lesson plan model. Moreover, to avoid further burdening
teachers’ heavy lesson requirements and schedules, the modules were
designed to be integrated into many subjects, such as language and
physical education, and to require minimum preparation (UNISDR, 2007b).

the community, Civil Defence, and other public entities visited the most

"CEE Himalaya celebrated International Mountain Day 2009 with educators
by conducting a week-long series of events on climate change adaptation
and disaster risk reduction. About 150 participants including teachers
and officials of the Department of Education, Ganderbal, participated in
these events (CEE Himalaya, 2009). Participants worked together to
identify climate change impacts in the local context, particularly in terms
of water availability, variation in microclimate, impact on agriculture/
horticulture and other livelihoods, and vulnerability to natural disasters.
The concept of School Disaster Management Plans (SDMPs) was
introduced. Participants actively prepared SDMPs for their schools
through group exercises, and discussed their opinions about village
contingency plans (CEE Himalaya, 2009). Some of the observations on
impacts of climate change in the area discussed by participants included
the melting, shrinking, and even disappearance of some glaciers and
the drying up of several wetlands and perennial springs. Heavy
deforestation, decline and extinction of wildlife, heavy soil erosion,
siltation of water bodies, fall in crop yields, and reduced availability of
fodder and other non- timber forest produce were some of the other
related issues discussed (CEE Himalaya, 2009). Participants watched
documentaries about climate change and played the Urdu version of
‘Riskland: Let's Learn to Prevent Disasters.’ They received educational
kits on disaster risk reduction and on climate change, translated and
adapted for Kashmir (CEE Himalaya, 2009).

"In 2004, typhoons resulted In tlooding In urban areas of Saljo City
(Ehime Prefecture of Shikoku Island, Japan). There were also landslides
in the mountains. As a result, a public awareness campaign was
implemented. Saijo City, a small city with semi-rural mountainous areas,
faces challenges in disaster risk reduction that are relatively unique. In
Japan, young people have a tendency to leave smaller communities and
move to larger cities. The result is that Japanese smaller towns have
older than the national average populations. Since younger, able-
bodied people are important for community systems of mutual aid and
emergency preparedness, there is a special challenge. Saijo City has an
urban plain, semi-rural and isolated villages on hills and mountains, and
a coastal area and, hence, is spread over a mix of geographic terrains
(Yoshida et al., 2009; ICTILO et al., 2010); this brings another challenge.
In 2005, the Saijo City Government launched a risk awareness program
to meet both of these challenges through a program targeted at school
children. The project for 12-year olds has a ‘mountain-watching’ focus
for the mountainside and a ‘town-watching’ focus for the urban area
(ICTILO et al., 2010). The students are taken, accompanied by teachers,
forest workers, local residents, and municipal officials, on risk-education
field trips. In the mountains, the young urban dwellers meet with the
elderly and they learn together about the risks the city faces. Part of the
process is to remember the lessons learned from the 2004 typhoons.
Additionally, a ‘mountain and town watching’ handbook has been
developed, a teachers’ association for disaster education was formed, a
kids’ disaster prevention club started, and a disaster prevention forum
for children was set up (Yoshida et al., 2009; ICTILO et al., 2010). This is
an example of a local government both conceiving and implementing the
program. The city government led a multi-stakeholder and community-
based disaster risk awareness initiative that then became self-sustaining.
Professionals from disaster reduction and education departments were
provided through government support. The government also funds the
town and mountain watching and puts on an annual forum (ICTILO et
al., 2010).

"A lesson identified by many case studies was that effective DRR education
contributes to reduce risks and losses, and is most effective when it is
not done in isolation, but concurs with other policies. The integration of
activities relating to education, training, and awareness-raising into
relevant ongoing processes and practices is important for the long-term
success of DRR and DRM activities. Investing in knowledge at primary

"and vulnerability reduction measures, as well as development of capacities
to respond and recover from the events were demonstrated to have
benefits. Specific examples for planning for extreme events included
increased emphasis on drought preparedness; planning for urban heat
waves; and tropical cyclone DRM strategies and plans in coastal regions
that anticipate these events. However, as illustrated by the SIDS case
study, it was also identified that DRR planning approaches continue to
receive less emphasis than disaster relief and recovery.
"	Text
"eee

It was also identified that DRM and preventive public health are closely
linked and largely synonymous. Strengthening and integrating these
measures, along with economic development, should increase resilience
against the health effects of extreme weather and facilitate adaptation
to climate change. Extreme weather events and population vulnerability
can interact to produce disastrous epidemic disease through direct
effects on the transmission cycle and also potentially through indirect
effects, such as population displacement.
"	Text
"The Philippines example shows that such integration is underway,
and the teacher training in Indonesia example concludes that such
integration can be helpful in avoiding overburdening full curricula.
Training of teachers and professionals in all relevant sectors can have
a positive multiplier effect. As the Nepalese teachers’ evaluation
example shows, teacher training is critical to address risk self-
perception and ensure that teachers pass on appropriate DRR
knowledge. The training of builders example in Nepal, India, and
the Philippines illustrates the successful dissemination of DRR
methods and tools within a critical sector across borders.

"A common factor was the need for greater amounts of useful information
on risks before the events occur, including early warnings. The
implementation of early warning systems does reduce loss of lives and
to a lesser extent damage to property. Early warning was identified by
all the extreme event case studies — heat waves, wildfires, drought,
dzud, cyclones, floods, and epidemics — as key to reducing the impacts
from extreme events. A need for improving international cooperation and
investments in forecasting was recognized in some of the case studies,
but equally the need for regional and local early warning systems was
heavily emphasized, particularly in developing countries.
"	Text
"Another lesson is that in order to implement a successful DRR or CCA
strategy, legal and regulatory frameworks are beneficial in ensuring
direction, coordination, and effective use of funds. The case studies are
helpful in this endeavor as effective and implemented legislation can
create a framework for governance of disaster risks. While this type of
approach is mainly for national governments and the ways in which
they devolve responsibilities to local administrations, there is an
important message for international governance and institutions as well.
Frameworks that facilitate cooperation with other countries to attain
better analysis of the risks will allow institutions to modify their focus
with changing risks and therefore maintain their effectiveness. This
cooperation could be at the local through national to international
levels. Here and in other ways, civil society has an important role.

"This chapter examined case studies of extreme climate events, vulnerable
regions, and methodological management approaches in order to glean
lessons and good practices. Case studies are provided to add context
and value to this report. They contribute to a focused analysis and convey,
in part, the reality of an event: the description of how certain extreme
events develop; the extent of human loss and financial damage; the
response strategies and interventions; the DRR, DRM, and CCA measures
and their effect on the overall outcomes; and cultural or region-specific
factors that may influence the outcome. Most importantly, case studies
provide a medium through which to learn practical lessons about
successes in DRR that are applicable for adaptation to climate change.
The lessons identified will prove useful at various levels from the
individual to national and international organizations as people try to
respond to extreme events and disasters and adapt to climate change.

It might be a ‘current baseline,’ in which case it represents observable,

Alternative interpretations of the reference conditions can give rise to
multiple baselines.

A collection of airborne solid or liquid particles, with a typical size
between 0.01 and 10 um, that reside in the atmosphere for at least
several hours. Aerosols may be of either natural or anthropogenic
origin. Aerosols may influence climate in several ways: directly through
scattering and absorbing radiation, and indirectly by acting as cloud
condensation nuclei or modifying the optical properties and lifetime of
clouds.

The nonlinearity of the climate system may lead to abrupt climate
change, sometimes called rapid climate change, abrupt events, or even
surprises. The term abrupt often refers to time scales faster than the
typical time scale of the responsible forcing. However, not all abrupt
climate changes need be externally forced. Some changes may be truly
unexpected, resulting from a strong, rapidly changing forcing of a
nonlinear system.

The gaseous envelope surrounding the Earth. The dry atmosphere

consists almost entirely of nitrogen (78.1% volume mixing ratio) and
oxygen (20.9% volume mixing ratio), together with a number of trace
gases, such as argon (0.93% volume mixing ratio), helium, and radiatively
active greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (0.035% volume mixing
ratio) and ozone. In addition, the atmosphere contains the greenhouse
gas water vapor, whose amounts are highly variable but typically
around 1% volume mixing ratio. The atmosphere also contains clouds
and aerosols.

An interaction mechanism between processes in the climate system is
called a climate feedback when the result of an initial process triggers
changes in a second process that in turn influences the initial one. A
positive feedback intensifies the original process, and a negative feedback
reduces it.

"| This definition differs from that in the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC), where climate change is defined as: “a change of climate
which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition
of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability
observed over comparable time periods.” The UNFCCC thus makes a distinction
between climate change attributable to human activities altering the atmospheric
composition, and climate variability attributable to natural causes.

A change in the state of the climate that can be identified (e.g., by
using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variability

"A plausible and often simplified representation of the future climate,
based on an internally consistent set of climatological relationships that
has been constructed for explicit use in investigating the potential

The climate system is the highly complex system consisting of five major
components: the atmosphere, the oceans, the cryosphere, the land
surface, the biosphere, and the interactions between them. The climate
system evolves in time under the influence of its own internal dynamics
and because of external forcings such as volcanic eruptions, solar
variations, and anthropogenic forcings such as the changing composition
of the atmosphere and land use change.

"A projection of the response of the climate system to emissions or
concentration scenarios of greenhouse gases and aerosols, or radiative
forcing scenarios, often based upon simulations by climate models.
Climate projections are distinguished from climate predictions in order

"Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the average weather, or
more rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of the mean and
variability of relevant quantities over a period of time ranging from months
to thousands or millions of years. The classical period for averaging
these variables is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological
Organization. The relevant quantities are most often surface variables
such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate in a wider sense
is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system. In
various chapters in this report different averaging periods, such as a

The term El Nifio was initially used to describe a warm-water current
that periodically flows along the coast of Ecuador and Peru, disrupting the
local fishery. It has since become identified with a basin-wide warming
of the tropical Pacific Ocean east of the dateline. This oceanic event is
associated with a fluctuation of a global-scale tropical and subtropical
surface pressure pattern called the Southern Oscillation. This coupled
atmosphere-ocean phenomenon, with preferred time scales of 2 to
about 7 years, is collectively known as the El Nifio-Southern Oscillation.
It is often measured by the surface pressure anomaly difference between
Darwin and Tahiti and the sea surface temperatures in the central and
eastern equatorial Pacific. During an ENSO event, the prevailing trade
winds weaken, reducing upwelling and altering ocean currents such
that the sea surface temperatures warm, further weakening the trade
winds. This event has a great impact on the wind, sea surface temperature,
and precipitation patterns in the tropical Pacific. It has climatic effects
throughout the Pacific region and in many other parts of the world,
through global teleconnections. The cold phase of ENSO is called La Nifia.

A probability density function is a function that indicates the relative

chances of occurrence of different outcomes of a variable. The function
integrates to unity over the domain for which it is defined and has the
property that the integral over a sub-domain equals the probability that
the outcome of the variable lies within that sub-domain. For example,
the probability that a temperature anomaly defined in a particular way
is greater than zero is obtained from its PDF by integrating the PDF
over all possible temperature anomalies greater than zero. Probability
density functions that describe two or more variables simultaneously

The temporary increase, at a particular locality, in the height of the sea
due to extreme meteorological conditions (low atmospheric pressure
and/or strong winds). The storm surge is defined as being the excess
above the level expected from the tidal variation alone at that time and
place.

"The process of formally or informally shifting the financial consequences
of particular risks from one party to another whereby a household,
community, enterprise, or state authority will obtain resources from
the other party after a disaster occurs, in exchange for ongoing or

Changes in sea level globally or locally, due to (i) changes in the shape
of the ocean basins, (ii) changes in the total mass and distribution of
water and land ice, (iii) changes in water density, and (iv) changes in
ocean circulation. Sea level changes induced by changes in water
density are called steric. Density changes induced by temperature
changes only are called thermosteric, while density changes induced by
salinity changes are called halosteric. See also Mean sea level.

"forcing is called instantaneous if no change in stratospheric temperature
is accounted for. For the purposes of this report, radiative forcing is
further defined as the change relative to the year 1750 and, unless
otherwise noted, refers to a global and annual average value. Radiative
forcing is not to be confused with cloud radiative forcing, a similar
terminology for describing an unrelated measure of the impact of
clouds on the irradiance at the top of the atmosphere.

The sea surface temperature is the temperature of the subsurface bulk
temperature in the top few meters of the ocean, measured by ships,
buoys, and drifters. From ships, measurements of water samples in
buckets were mostly switched in the 1940s to samples from engine intake
water. Satellite measurements of skin temperature (uppermost layer; a
fraction of a millimeter thick) in the infrared or the top centimeter or so
in the microwave are also used, but must be adjusted to be compatible
with the bulk temperature.

Reanalyses are atmospheric and oceanic analyses of temperature, wind,
current, and other meteorological and oceanographic quantities, created
by processing past meteorological and oceanographic data using fixed
state-of-the-art weather forecasting models and data assimilation
techniques. Using fixed data assimilation avoids effects from the
changing analysis system that occur in operational analyses. Although
continuity is improved, global reanalyses still suffer from changing
coverage and biases in the observing systems.

The general term for a strong, cyclonic-scale disturbance that originates
over tropical oceans. Distinguished from weaker systems (often named
tropical disturbances or depressions) by exceeding a threshold wind
speed. A tropical storm is a tropical cyclone with one-minute average
surface winds between 18 and 32 ms*!. Beyond 32 ms"", a tropical
cyclone is called a hurricane, typhoon, or cyclone, depending on
geographic location.

oF
The principle that decisions of government (other things being equal) are
best made and implemented, if possible, at the lowest most decentralized
level closest to the citizen. Subsidiarity is designed to strengthen
accountability and reduce the dangers of making decisions in places
remote from their point of application. The principle does not necessarily
limit or constrain the action of higher orders of government, it merely
counsels against the unnecessary assumption of responsibilities at a
higher level.

oF

An expression of the degree to which a value or relationship is
unknown. Uncertainty can result from lack of information or from
disagreement about what is known or even knowable. Uncertainty may
originate from many sources, such as quantifiable errors in the data,
ambiguously defined concepts or terminology, or uncertain projections
of human behavior. Uncertainty can therefore be represented by
quantitative measures, for example, a range of values calculated by
various models, or by qualitative statements, for example, reflecting the
judgment of a team of experts. See also Likelihood and Confidence.
